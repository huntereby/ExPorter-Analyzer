10769739,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in
humans. Despite multimodal aggressive therapy, GBM is fatal—with survival over 3 years being considered
long-term. More therapeutic targets and treatment options are clearly needed. In our preliminary study, we
identified a novel oncogene, AVIL in GBMs. AVIL gene is overexpressed in all the glioblastoma cell lines,
including glioblastoma stem cells, and clinical cases, but is hardly detectable in non-cancer astrocytes, neural
stem cells, and brain tissues. Silencing AVIL resulted in complete eradication in GBM cell cultures, but had
little effect on the astrocyte control cells. In animal models, silencing AVIL dramatically inhibited in vivo
xenografts in mice. Conversely, overexpressing AVIL in cell culture systems promoted tumorigenesis, enabled
fibroblasts to escape contact inhibition, and transformed immortalized astrocytes. In patient cohorts, higher
expression levels of AVIL in gliomas correlated with worse prognosis. Most importantly, GBM cells are more
susceptible to small molecule inhibitors of AVIL. These evidences support the premise that AVIL is an Achilles
heel of GBMs, targeting which may be an effective approach for GBMs. In this application, we propose the
systematic investigation of AVIL as a novel target against GBMs. Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of targeting
AVIL in vitro and test AVIL expression as a biomarker of sensitivity. We have shown the critical role of AVIL in
some GBM and GSC cell lines. Here, we will investigate its role in additional glioblastoma lines, GSCs, and
short-term explants of GBM patient derived xenograft cultures and potential synergistic effect with
CDK4/MDM2. We will test the efficacy of tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AVIL, and small molecule compounds
we identified through small molecule screen. In addition, we will determine whether AVIL expression serves as
a biomarker for sensitivity to AVIL inhibition. Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of targeting AVIL in animal GBM
models. We will use shRNA and small-molecule inhibitors in xenograft models to test both the efficacy and
safety of targeting AVIL in vivo. In addition, we will use Avil knockout mouse model by crossing them with
glioma mouse models to test whether Avil expression is necessary for glioma tumorigenesis in mouse. Aim 3:
Investigate the downstream targets and mechanisms of AVIL inhibition and identify potential pharmacodynamic
biomarkers. We have preliminary data suggesting AVIL regulates LIN28B, and FOXM1 may mediate the effect
in U87 cells. We will investigate whether LIN28B and FOXM1 are functionally critical targets of AVIL, and
whether they are potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers to evaluate treatment efficacy of AVIL-targeting
therapy. Aim 4: Investigate potential resistance mechanisms of targeting AVIL. The goal is to anticipate
challenges to AVIL-based treatment before they arise in the clinical setting. The proposed study will have a
significant impact on the understanding and treatment of GBMs. The findings will pave ways to target AVIL as
a novel oncogene, and lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the deadly disease."
10769857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The long-term objective of this project is to investigate the fundamental immunological mechanisms
involved in the development of asthma and allergic diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that cytokines
produced by epithelial cells, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25, and IL-33, play an important role in
shaping type 2 immunity and in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases. However, major gaps remain in our
knowledge concerning the molecular and cellular control of production and secretion of these cytokines. In this
application, we will investigate the mechanisms involved in IL-33 secretion.
 IL-33 is primarily stored in the nucleus of non-hematologic cells; nuclear localization is a unique feature of
this cytokine. We previously found that exposure of human airway epithelial cells to a fungal allergen,
Alternaria alternata, evokes rapid extracellular release of ATP, which triggers sustained increases in
intracellular calcium concentration and IL-33 secretion into the extracellular milieu. We also found that airway
epithelial cells release acetylcholine (ACh) extracellularly following Alternaria or house dust mite allergen
exposure. Importantly, blocking M3 muscarinc receptors (M3R) on epithelial cells suppressed ATP release and
IL-33 secretion, suggesting an autocrine role for ACh. Therefore, we hypothesize that allergen-induced ACh
secretion by the airway epithelium plays a pivotal role in triggering a sequence of intracellular events that lead
to extracellular release of IL-33.
 The experiments described in this proposal will investigate key steps of this process in detail. In Aim 1,
we will deterimne how airborne allergen exposure triggers ACh secretion and early cellular responses in airway
epithelial cells in vitro. In Aim 2, we will investigate how epithelium-derived ACh facilitates IL-33 secretion by
focusing on the autocrine ACh/M3R signaling pathway and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of key
regulatory proteins. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of epithelial ACh/M3R signaling in allergen-induced IL-
33 secretion and initiation of type 2 immunity in the lung by using mouse models of allergic inflammation.
 We will employ a combination of complementary expertise in molecular and cell biology, pharmacology
and immunology in the laboratories of Dr. O’Grady and Dr. Kita. Novel and robust in vitro and in vivo models
have been developed for this project. These studies will provide a better understanding of how the epithelium
responds to environmental allergens and will define key cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for
secretion of IL-33. Ultimately, these studies will characterize critical mechanism(s) involved in allergen-induced
immune responses, allowing for identification of novel therapeutic target(s) to treat and ideally prevent
immune-mediated airway diseases, such as asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and other allergic disorders."

Many different disease states and surgical interventions result in a period of inadequate
tissue/organ blood supply (i.e., ischemia), that result in reperfusion injury when blood flow is
restored, known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI causes local inflammation, cell death,
excessive tissue destruction and possible organ failure. Examples are found in transplantation,
trauma, myocardial infarction, stroke, and in particular, IRI is a main cause of liver dysfunction
and failure after liver surgery. Unfortunately, there are currently no therapies available in clinical
practice addressing IRI, where a major problem is the harmful systemic side effects and toxicities
of existing drugs.
To address this problem, we are innovating a new therapeutic technology aiming to program
immune cells toward a metabolic state blocking excessive inflammation by directing tryptophan
metabolism through delivery of an enzyme into circulation. This represents a new class of anti-
inflammatory/immunosuppressive biologic drug, with potential to limit systemic toxicities/side
effects, and with potential to be significantly less immunocompromising. Lack of treatment options
for liver IRI and a catalog of in vivo preliminary data strongly supporting the foundational rationale
of IDO as an innovative new anti-inflammatory agent, make this proposal highly significant.
Looking to the future, success would open opportunity to expand to other anti-inflammatory
applications, for example, pre-conditioning donor grafts for transplantation."

10769726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All women experience menopause, putting a female at risk for a number of chronic diseases, including an
increased risk of obesity. Although post-menopausal replacement of estrogen (hormone replacement therapy -
HRT) has been shown to be effective at protecting against the metabolic and inflammatory perturbations linked
to estrogen-deficiency, HRT has been shown to pose unwanted health risks including an increased risk of
stroke, heart attack, and a variety of cancers. As such, it has become a priority of the National Center for
Complementary and Integrative Health to invest in the development of therapies that are both safe AND
effective at combating menopause-induced side effects, including excess fat mass accrual and its related
negative metabolic and inflammatory perturbations. One such potential alternative therapy is the potent
phytoestrogen from the Humulus Lupus plant (hops), 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN). The overall research
objectives in this application are to determine 1) the dose of 8-PN that is both safe and effective at combating
the metabolic and inflammatory perturbations linked to obesity in a setting of estrogen deficiency, 2) the tissue
most responsive to 8-PN supplementation, and 3) elucidate the in vivo signaling mechanism of 8-PN action.
The long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective natural therapy for the clinical treatment of menopause-
associated metabolic impairments and inflammatory-driven health perturbations. The central hypothesis is that
8-PN can serve as a potent and safe natural therapeutic for estrogen-deficient-induced inflammatory and
metabolic perturbations. The rationale for this project is that this pre-clinical work will lay the foundation for the
utilization of 8-PN as a potent therapeutic for impaired metabolic and exacerbated inflammatory processes
resulting from estrogen deficiency. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Determine the effective and safe dose of 8-PN to serve as a therapy for metabolic and inflammatory
perturbations in an estrogen-deficient model, 2) will examine the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is the tissue
most metabolically responsive to 8-PN therapy through estrogen-receptor alpha action. The research
proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, as, to date, no studies have systematically
examined the protective capacity of 8-PN against metabolic and inflammatory perturbations or thoroughly
assessed the potential toxicity of 8-PN’s long-term use in an estrogen-deficient model. The proposed research
is significant as the results from this investigation will have an important positive impact for ALL women
because they will lay the groundwork for future clinical trials using 8-PN as a therapy for the negative health
side effects linked to estrogen deficiency."

Emergency general surgery (EGS) - accounting for 11% of US hospital admissions; over 50% of operative
mortality; the highest risk, acuity, rate of complications, and cost in general surgery - particularly the subset of
emergency laparotomy (EL) patients which suffer the worst EGS outcomes - is increasingly recognized as a
public health crisis. While enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) have dramatically advanced pre-, intra-, and
inpatient postoperative evidenced-based best practices (EBPs), ERPs have largely ignored subsequent
postoperative home-based recovery. Despite certain postoperative complications occurring commonly after
discharge (notably over 40% of surgical site infections [SSI]), recovery for surgical patients once discharged to
home remains understudied and ripe for improvement and innovation, especially as surgical care models
increasingly shift greater proportions of postoperative recovery into the home-based setting. Digital solutions
for remote monitoring, patient engagement/education, and surgical prediction show promise but are used
minimally for surgical recovery. We hypothesize that well-designed technology solutions for EL home- and
transition-based workflows engaging diverse stakeholders will empower EL patients, their caregivers, and care
teams to achieve optimal outcomes and safe recovery. The goal of REST-PSLL (Re-engineering Surgical
Recovery and Transitions Using Technology Patient Safety Learning Laboratory) is to apply systems
engineering approaches to co-produce innovative and scalable patient- and care team-centric solutions for EL
home-based recovery. REST-PSLL has the following specific aims. Aim 1: Identify barriers and facilitators to
ideal at-home recovery for patients following EL. We will engage stakeholders using the Systems Engineering
for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to identify and evaluate factors to understand barriers and facilitators of
optimal care and postoperative complications with a focus on SSI. Aim 2: Iteratively design and develop new
processes, tools, and technologies that help remove or reduce barriers to ideal at-home recovery. We will use
swimlane diagrams to then analyze for areas of improvement to generate initial design requirements and
prototypes for tools/technologies followed by iterative user-centered design to specify design requirements,
develop solutions, and conduct end-user testing at our clinical sites. Aim 3: Implement and evaluate solutions
in practice. Perform pilot testing and implementation, assess primary (addressing or avoiding trigger/potential
issue, solution us) and secondary outcomes guided by RE-AIM framework; evaluate implementation phases
guided by EPIS implementation framework to generate implementation learnings and solution revision plan(s).
REST-PSLL is poised to be highly successful and impactful, highlighted by: a) anticipated learnings that can be
extrapolated to other surgical populations; b) use of transdisciplinary complementary systems expertise and
approaches; c) deep clinical expertise; d) patient- and caregiver- co-production; and e) expanding or
optimizing existing solutions/platforms."
10773012,"Abstract
Severe allergic asthmatic disease is characterized by significant airway structure changes and chronic
inflammation predominated by eosinophils, mononuclear cells, and lymphocytes, and accompanied by mucus
hypersecretion that depends upon the nature of the immune response. The most severe airways disease
progresses through a continuum of responses ranging from manageable airway dysfunction to a steroid
resistant state that is often a result of a severe exacerbation that is difficult to control. Over the more than 25
years of work in this area my laboratory has defined the role of numerous cytokines and chemokines that
initiate and drive the pulmonary immune responses, identified innate immune molecules that shape the
immune phenotype (TLRs, Notch), defined a role for respiratory viral infections that induce and exacerbate
disease, examined epigenetic regulation of immune cell function, and more recently identified metabolic control
of innate immune cell activation. Many of our previous discoveries have revealed potential therapeutic targets
for pulmonary diseases, including studies in our 2nd NHLBI RO1 that examine stem cell factor and ILC2. One
of our present NHLBI RO1 grants is examining the role of autophagy and cellular metabolism for innate
immune cell function. Our most recent studies are addressing additional mechanisms linked to trained
immunity within the lung, as well as development of lung responses that alter the structural and functional
integrity of the lung. While we will be combining 2 RO1 with divergent themes, our overall objective of
understanding how the pulmonary immune environment is developed and maintained during disease is central
to all of our studies. Together, our past and ongoing investigations are revealing an integrated understanding
of not only the immune responses during disease development, but also the long-term consequence of early
disease and its relationship to altered lung function and development. Using this R35 mechanism, we will
continue expanding on these areas of research that will be paradigm shifting. We will focus on specific goals
including 1) determine how early RSV-induced responses in the lung alter the innate immune cell phenotype
and induce lung structural changes that predisposes the lung to later allergic/asthmatic responses; 2) examine
the role that stem cell factor (SCF) has on altering the activation of ILC2 populations in chronic pulmonary
disease; and 3) investigate how cell metabolism alters immune cell development during disease to maintain
and extend disease severity. Completion of these studies will provide new insights, establish new paradigms,
and complete proof of concept studies needed to advance knowledge and validate new, therapeutically
relevant mechanisms in clinical disease."
10773013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MHC class I (MHC-I) -restricted peptide cancer vaccines hold the minimal amount of biochemical information
required for generating antigen-specific T cells to elicit anti-tumor responses. On their own, immunization with
minimal peptide epitopes does not provide a satisfactory response, so typically long peptides or conjugated
delivery systems are necessitated. However, such approaches defeat the directness of short synthetic peptide
vaccines. A new peptide vaccine immunization paradigm will be introduced, based on combining (via simple
mixing) MHC-I peptide epitopes with a vaccine adjuvant that induces spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen
particleization (SNAP). Liposomes that contain small amounts of cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP) rapidly
bind short his-tagged peptides (8-9mers) via spontaneous insertion of the his-tag into the bilayer. This gives rise
to particleization that is stable in biological media. His-tagged peptides are simply mixed with CoPoP liposomes
at the time of vaccination (without further purification) to convert these well-characterized peptides into a 100 nm
particle. This approach is potently effective in generating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. AH1 is a MHC-I H-2Ld
model CD8+ epitope derived from the gp70 murine leukemia virus antigen. An AH1-derived peptide can be used
with SNAP immunization to generate high numbers of antigen specific CD8+ T cells. SNAP immunization with
low nanogram doses peptides completely protects mice from subsequent tumor challenge, and eradicates 100%
of lung metastases in a therapeutic vaccine model. Varying components of SNAP immunization will be assessed,
including the his-tag length, the density and dose of co-incorporated (MPLA and QS-21; both part of GSK’s
vaccine adjuvant AS01) to determine their impact the Ag-specific CD8+ response. Generation of Ag-specific
CD44+ CD62L+ cells will be assessed to determine whether such central memory cells are more effective in
eradicating tumors. Vaccine efficacy will be tested in multiple prophylactic and therapeutic local and metastasis
tumor models. Therapeutic treatment of large tumors will be assessed with the impact of cyclophosphamide and
checkpoint blockade. Mechanistic insights will be probed by assessing how the delivered peptide reaches MHC-
I. It is hypothesized that his-tag peptides bind to CoPoP liposomes, and undergo serum-stable transit to draining
lymph nodes. There, they are phagocytosed by dendritic cells where the reductive environment of phagosomes
is also suspected to induce the release of the peptide from the CoPoP liposomes. Toll-like receptor in the bilayer
are hypothesized to upregulate the expression of MHC-I within the phagosome. Further studies will assess the
viability of SNAP immunization and antigen multiplexing as an in vivo screening tool for peptide microlibraries
using established tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens that will be identified with next-generation
sequencing. Finally, the safety and cobalt response of the system will be assessed. These studies will provide
substantial advancement for short, MHC-I-restricted peptide-based cancer vaccines for cancer therapy and
immunogenic epitope screening."
10746767,"This career development award details a 5-year training plan to facilitate transition to an independent career as
a hepatogeneticist focused on gene discovery and characterization for hepatobiliary disease. I completed my
Pediatrics residency at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children and my fellowship in Human Genetics at The
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). I am currently an attending physician and research fellow at CHOP
in the Division Of Human Genetics. My clinical and research efforts focus on children with hepatobiliary disease.
My goals for this proposal are to become more experienced with exome and genetic variant interpretation and
to gain experience using zebrafish as a model to study hepatobiliary disease. I will also use this opportunity to
develop my ability to design experiments, write successful grant applications, and lead a laboratory, to facilitate
a smooth transition to academic faculty.
My mentor for this proposal is Dr. Hakon Hakonarson, a Professor of Pediatrics and director of the Center for
Applied Genomics (CAG) at CHOP. Dr. Hakonarson has mentored dozens of post-doctoral research fellows and
K-awardees, and was the recipient of CHOP’s Research Mentor Award. I will be co-mentored by Dr. Michael
Pack, a Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Dr. Pack also has an extensive history
of mentoring trainees and K-awardees and works closely with Dr. Hakonarson on novel gene characterization. I
have also assembled a scientific advisory committee, consisting of Drs. Klaus Kaestner, Ben Stanger, Kirk
Wangensteen, Tom Jongens, and Elizabeth Rand, all experts in the fields of hepatology, neurogenetics or
genetics with extensive mentoring experience. I will also have the benefit of the outstanding resources at both
CHOP and UPenn, which have facilitated career development for countless past trainees.
My proposed research focusses on the discovery and characterization of novel genes implicated in hepatobiliary
disease. We are assembling a cohort of individuals with unexplained hepatobiliary disease, and will apply a
research pipeline to facilitate identification of novel genes. Our laboratory has already identified de novo
nonsense and frameshift variants in MED12 as causal for Hardikar Syndrome, a syndromic form of biliary
dysgenesis, of previously unknown genetic basis. Aim 1 of this proposal delineates how a patient cohort will be
assembled and characterized, and Aim 2 details the characterization of the role of MED12 in biliary development.
Completion of the proposed studies will improve our ability to genetically diagnose hepatobiliary disease, better
characterize the genetic landscape of these poorly-understood conditions, and elucidate the mechanism by
which nonsense and frameshift MED12 variants cause biliary disease. This proposal will also provide me with
experience studying hepatobiliary disease in animal and cellular models, writing grants and scientific papers,
and allow me to observe how academic laboratories are run. Furthermore, this patient cohort and the cellular
and animal models developed as part of this proposal will be invaluable in my future career."
10746771,"Project Summary
 One out of seven adults in the United States suffers difficulty in hearing. Most hearing loss is related to
inner ear dysfunction. A prominent signature of hearing loss is damage of outer hair cells, which can result in
40-60 dB of hearing loss. Outer hair cells are known as cellular actuators that are needed for cochlear
amplification. Outer hair cells are situated in the cochlear sensory epithelium called the organ of Corti. The
organ of Corti is sandwiched between two collagen-fiber-rich matrices called the basilar and tectorial
membranes. Traditionally, studies on cochlear amplification were focused on motion of the basilar membrane,
but new evidence is suggesting that we have been seeing only one-side of the story (basal-side of the outer
hair cells). Recent advancement in imaging and velocimetry techniques enables scientists to ‘see-through’ the
cochlea so that they can capture organ of Corti motion beyond the basilar membrane. New observations using
recent techniques are both exciting and puzzling. For example, at the apical side of the outer hair cell,
vibrations are broadly tuned as compared to basilar membrane motion or neural responses. Functional
consequences of the incongruence between mechanical and neural tuning are unclear. Two challenges are
impeding the progress of hearing science regarding cochlear amplification. First, despite recent progress, the
resolution of velocity measurement techniques is insufficient to specify individual outer hair cells. Second, in
experiments with live animals, there are very limited means to control outer hair cell physiology.
 This project resolves those two challenges. We have developed novel in vitro methods that enable us
to measure the motion of individual outer hair cells under electrically, chemically and mechanically controlled
conditions. Experimental outcomes are explained and extended by our Virtual Cochlea—a set of computer
models to analyze cochlear mechano-transduction. By combining these experiments and the computer
models, we can ensure scientific rigor of our research while minimizing animal use. For transparency, acquired
data and computer programs will be made available to public.
 The three aims of this proposal are designed to quantify the most needed biophysical attributes needed
to address open questions regarding cochlear amplification and tuning. They are 1) the deflection of stereocilia
(mechano-receptive organelle of the hair cells) due to outer hair cell motility, 2) mechanical properties of the
tectorial membrane and the Deiters cell (structures in series with the outer hair cell), and 3) the operating range
of stereocilia mechano-transduction (stereocilia deflection to saturate hair cell mechano-transduction). The
Virtual Cochlea is validated by comparing with the measurements of three aims before testing our overarching
hypothesis—the organ of Corti must be as compliant as the outer hair cells for the outer hair cells to generate
power for cochlear amplification."
10746772,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular diseases are often associated with impaired responses from the endothelium, which results
from endothelial cell dysfunction. Endothelial cell dysfunction causes endothelial activation and sub-endothelial
retention of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, leading to the recruitment of immune and
inflammatory cells to the intima, which initiate atheromatous plaque build-up. Of major importance, transitioning
from a stable to vulnerable atheroma fuels myocardial infarction and stroke, posing enormous health
challenges with the highest morbidity and mortality in the United States. New research is urgently needed to
uncover critical pathophysiological mechanisms and identify molecules that limit endothelial dysfunction. This
has led us to determine a novel and indispensable role for an endocytic adaptor protein called Disabled
homolog 2 (Dab2), which participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in addition to moonlighting as a tumor
suppressor. Curiously, little to no prior work has been done to identify its role in endothelial cells. Our pilot
assessment has revealed that Dab2 levels are strikingly decreased in the atherosclerotic endothelium of
mouse and human fatty streaks—suggesting a protective role in atherogenesis. As the atheroprotective effects
of Dab2 are poorly understood in the context of endothelial cells, we created endothelial-specific inducible
Dab2 knockout mice (EC-iDab2KO) and bred them to an ApoE-null background (EC-Dab2iKO/ApoE-/-).
Western diet-fed EC-iDab2KO/ApoE-/- mice exhibit heightened arterial inflammation and more severe plaque
formation; yet, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that direct Dab2 to combat arterial
inflammation are completely unknown. Our initial investigation indicates that Dab2 expression is upregulated in
response to atheroprotective flow, and Dab2 deficiency in human aortic endothelial cells suppresses
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation. To ensure the clinical relevance of our work, we are
employing an innovative nanotechnology to deliver Dab2 mRNA to the atherogenic endothelium using an
engineered nanoparticle to restore Dab2 function. This technology increases Dab2 expression in the atheroma,
which restrains plaque progression in ApoE-/- mice. The goal of this proposal is to define the signaling
mechanisms underpinning the essential role of Dab2 in protecting the atherogenic endothelium. To this end,
we seek to determine molecular mechanisms by which Dab2 curbs arterial inflammation and activates eNOS in
endothelial cells. Our possession of innovative targeting reagents and novel animal models will greatly facilitate
our paradigm-shifting endeavor. If fruitful, the exciting work proposed in our application will provide a
foundation for the development of new treatments to benefit patients at-risk for heart attacks and strokes."
10746773,"Checkpoint blockade, which targets inhibitory receptors that suppress successful T cell responses to tumors,
demonstrates the critical role that the immune response plays against cancer. However, not all cancers
respond to immunotherapy or checkpoint blockade targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 on T cells. For example, the
majority of patients with colon cancer do not respond to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, which is effective in
only 4% of patients with microsatellite instability. Thus, many tumors may target other inhibitory receptors or
different components of the immune system to block it from mounting an effective response. One family of
inhibitory receptors on immune cells is the Siglec family, which recognize ligands with sialic acid modifications
on cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. There are twenty eukaryotic sialic acid transferases, each of which
differ in their preferred linkage, targets and number of sialic acids added. It has been long recognized that
tumors alter the type and frequency of glycosylation and sialic acid on the cell surface. In particular, increased
incorporation of sialic acid is frequently observed in cancer, although the function of hyper-sialylation in
promoting and sustaining tumor growth is not well understood. Interestingly, using the COSMIC database, we
found that while 389 human tumors over-expressed the sialic acid transferase ST8Sia6, none under-expressed
ST8Sia6; this indicates a strong selective advantage for tumors with high ST8Sia6, although the function of
ST8Sia6 in cancer is not known. We demonstrated that ST8Sia6 overexpression in either MC38 or B16-F10
tumor cell lines accelerated tumor growth in mice. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in ST8Sia6-
expressing tumors possessed an M2-like phenotype, as compared to a M1-like phenotype in tumors formed
from the parental MC38 or B16-F10 tumor cell lines that lack ST8Sia6 expression. We demonstrated that
ST8Sia6 generates ligands for the inhibitory Siglec, Siglec-E, whose expression is restricted to innate immune
cells. The growth advantage of ST8Sia6-expressing tumor cells was lost when injected into Siglec-E knockout
mice, demonstrating that the primary effect of ST8Sia6 overexpression is on inhibition of the immune response
of the host rather than an intrinsic effect on cell growth. We have developed a novel cre-dependent, dox-
regulatable ST8Sia6 transgene to study the effect of ST8Sia6 in spontaneous tumor models. Overexpression
of ST8Sia6 in a spontaneous model of colon cancer dramatically decreased survival to 2-3 months instead of 6
months, demonstrating the strong effect ST8Sia6 overexpression has on tumor cell growth in vivo. This
proposal will examine the function of ST8Sia6 in modulating the immune response to tumors.

10771205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic, heavy alcohol consumption leads to a disruption of stress homeostasis and a feed-forward cycle of
alcohol-stress interactions that further exacerbate alcohol drinking. The rhesus monkey model of alcohol self-
administration has documented allostatic changes within key brain areas associated with chronic heavy alcohol
drinking. These include hypothalamic control of the stress axis and the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen)
implicated in control of action selection. Specifically, the striatal and HPA axis neuroadaptations were associated
with an increase in alcohol drinking during relapse, deficits in flexibility in action selection and shift in the
excitatory-to-inhibitory balance favoring the sensorimotor neurocircuitry. The proposed studies will exploit
individual differences in stress regulation and behavioral flexibility to identify mechanisms underlying excessive
drinking and susceptibility to relapse. The integrative designs encompass: self-administration with repeated
abstinence/relapse cycles in rhesus monkeys; longitudinal measures of flexibility in action selection, stress
response and integrity of brain neurocircuitry using rs-fMRI; manipulating cortico-dorsostriatal circuits in primate
brain using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADDs) to alter ethanol drinking,
behavioral flexibility and stress response. Ultimately, this project aims to define the role of cortico-striatal circuitry
in protecting or facilitating excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also contribute to emerging sex
differences in the stress response to chronic drinking through a balanced sex design."
10778436,"ABSTRACT
 Astrocytomas (WHO grade II and III) primarily occur in early-middle adult life. Most lower grade
astrocytoma progress to higher grade including GBM (i.e., secondary GBM) despite the best standard-of-care
therapy. Developing more effective therapeutic strategies requires a more complete understanding of the
mechanisms employed by astrocytoma cells to escape anti-tumor immunity. The majority (~80%) of grade II &
grade III astrocytoma carry mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (e.g., IDH1R132H), which typically occurs with
p53 mutation and ATRX inactivation (i.e., IDH1R132H/p53mut/ATRXloss, triple-mut for simplicity), indicating that this
triple mutation background has an important role in tumor growth potentially including immune evasion
mechanisms. However, our current understanding of how triple-mut astrocytoma cells modulate the tumor
microenvironment (TME) to suppress anti-tumor immunity is limited and inadequate. The goal of this project is
to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which triple-mut astrocytoma cells modulate TME immune
cells and use these discoveries to develop novel strategies to sensitize triple-mut astrocytoma cells to emerging
immunotherapeutics. Our recent published findings and preliminary data show that triple-mut induces multiple
pathways critical to anti-tumor immunity including checkpoint ligands, IFN-γ signaling insensitivity, down-
regulation of MHC-I and -II antigen presentation pathways (MHC APP), and dysregulated cytokine/chemokine
profiles that modulate the astrocytoma immune microenvironment. Furthermore, we found that the components
of the immune-modulating astrocytoma transcriptome are augmented by standard-of-care radiation (IR) and
temozolomide (TMZ). Our findings implicate BET and EHMT as epigenetic determinants of astrocytoma immune-
modulating transcriptome. Building on these interesting findings, we will pursue the following specific aims: (i)

10774452,"For decades, researchers have used the log-rank test/Cox’s hazard ratio (HR) test/estimation approach as the standard primary analysis for clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes. The statistical significance test based on the log-rank or HR-based test statistic offers a dichotomous decision about the superiority of one treatment over another to support the regulatory approval of new drugs or define the standard of care in a population. However, patients and clinicians often need additional information to make value-driven treatment decisions, including the magnitude of risks and benefits of the treatments they are considering. Despite its common use, the HR does not provide robust, reliable, and clinically interpretable quantitative information about the risks and benefits of a new treatment; new analytic methods are needed to inform patient-centered cancer treatment decisions. Our team recently developed a novel two-sample comparison method that has the potential to change the traditional analytic practice and significantly improve the interpretation of the magnitude of treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes. The new method utilizes the ""average hazard"" (AH) --- a new summary measure of the event time distribution, with three main advantages over alternative methods. First, the AH can be estimated nonparametrically and has a clear interpretation as the general Censoring-Free person-time Incidence Rate (gCFIR). Second, it provides treatment effect estimates in both absolute difference and relative terms, which increases the likelihood that clinicians, clinical trialists, and patients can understand the treatment effect magnitude correctly. Third, since the between-group treatment effect summaries provided by this method consist of ""hazards"", it would be more likely to be accepted in practice than existing alternative methods by clinical researchers accustomed to Cox's ""hazard"" ratio. The proposed study aims to establish the gCFIR approach for use as the primary analysis for treatment risk and benefit estimation and disseminate it to the clinical research community. In Aim 1, we will develop the following methods that are indispensable for this approach to be employed as the primary analysis in practice: 1) regression analysis, 2) interim analysis, 3) adjusted analysis, 4) analysis for competing risks, and 5) analysis for observational studies. In Aim 2, we will develop dissemination materials, including implementation software and a user-friendly guide with vignettes. We will provide clinicians and clinical trialists with free webinar courses. The overarching goal of this work is to use novel analytic methods to enhance communication and clinical interpretability of research findings, thereby facilitating translation of scientific results from clinical research into clinical practice. Ultimately, the proposed project can support informed conversations about treatment options between clinicians and patients."
10774609,"Genetic variations in HLA genes in humans are associated with over 200 diseases, and large-scale genomic sequencing projects are now generating data on HLA genes from millions of individuals. Despite their immense clinical relevance, next-generation sequencing based computational inference of short (SNP or insertion/deletion) in HLA genes is difficult because of their highly polymorphic nature, inter-HLA gene similarity, and strong linkage disequilibrium. Existing tools for HLA variant detection are error-prone, not designed for scalability, not interoperable across sequencing formats, and the developers have no formal mechanisms to provide support after publication. The objective of this application is to develop highly accurate, robust, scalable, and deployment-ready pipelines for identifying germline and somatic variants in HLA genes through integration and enhancement of our previously developed tools. To achieve this goal, we aim to (1) Develop tools for detecting short germline and somatic HLA variants by enhancing our Polysolver tool for allele inference across all HLA genes, and further developing the Mutect3 pipeline for mutation detection; (2) Establish a reference dataset for benchmarking performance of HLA variant detection tools; and (3) Use the widely used GATK4 framework and Workflow Definition Language (WDL) to create and disseminate robust, scalable and well-supported HLA variant detection pipelines. This will be the first such comprehensive HLA analysis toolkit, which we expect will be widely used by both individual researchers and sequencing consortia in multiple disease communities. Mutect3, which internally employs a “deep sets” architecture, will be the first mutation detection tool capable of jointly calling germline and somatic short variants and handling multiple references at a genomic locus. If successful, this project will unlock the hitherto untapped potential of rapidly growing sequencing datasets by enabling discovery of new HLA alleles, variations in known HLA alleles, and novel HLA-disease associations which can directly be harnessed for personalized preventive and therapeutic applications."
10770965,"ABSTRACT
Adverse reproductive outcomes, including preeclampsia and hypertension, preterm birth, growth restriction, and
small for gestational age birth contribute significantly to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality and can lead
to long term health consequences for both mother and offspring. The placenta plays a central role in successful
pregnancy outcomes, fetal development, and it is increasingly being recognized for playing an important role in
developmental programming of the fetus and contributing to childhood health and disease. Environmental
chemicals are known to contribute to the risk for adverse reproductive outcomes and these chemicals may be
eliciting their toxic effects through impacts on the function of the placenta. One particular function of the placenta
that is only beginning to be fully understood is its role as a peripheral molecular clock. Disruptions to the
molecular clock are recognized to be involved in several adverse reproductive outcomes and recent data
suggests that deregulation of molecular clock genes impacts important placental cellular processes such as cell
migration. There is also evidence to suggest that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) maybe a central regulator
of the placental molecular clock and that a mixture of toxic chemicals, including pesticides, alters the placental
molecular clock through inhibition of EGF signaling through the EGF receptor (EGFR). These findings support
the premise that a properly functioning molecular clock is required for placental health. However, it remains
unknown if environmental chemicals cause placental dysfunction via molecular clock disruption. This
consortium, consisting of a placental toxicologist (Veiga-Lopez), circadian biologist (Hoffmann), and pregnancy
molecular epidemiologist (Marsit), has developed a project that will lead to an understanding of how gestational
environmental exposures impact the molecular clock resulting in placental dysfunction, by examining the overall
hypothesis that chemicals that interfere with molecular clock signaling through EGFR lead to placental cell
dysfunction in a gestational age- and placenta layer-specific manner. In a mouse model, we will examine how
gestational age, placenta layer, and sex impacts molecular clock sensitivity to chemical exposures. In human
placenta cellular models, we will identify mechanisms through which the molecular clock proteins PER1, PER2,
and PER3 impact cellular function upon chemical exposures. Finally, using a pregnancy cohort of farm-working
women and their offspring, we will determine the association between pesticide exposure and placental
molecular clock gene dysregulation and build causal evidence by comparing results to those from the mouse
model. Through this new and exciting collaboration, there is a unique opportunity to comprehensively
demonstrate the importance of the placenta as a peripheral clock and to provide evidence that exposures
relevant to the human population impact the placental molecular clock which has lifelong implications for health
and disease."

10767955,"Upon transmission by a vector tick bite, Lyme disease spirochetes, primarily B. burgdorferi (Bb) in the US,
establish a local skin infection, then disseminate to multiple tissues. Chronic infection by Bb is often associated
with arthritis. Our laboratories have identified and/or characterized many Bb cell- or extracellular matrix (ECM)-
binding adhesins using multiple approaches, overcoming the challenges of defining their roles in Bb biology.
Our approaches include analyses of biochemical activities and generation of targeted mutants selectively
defective for a single adhesive activity and analysis of the mutants in multiple murine infection models. To gain
detailed mechanistic insight into interactions that may occur during Bb dissemination in vivo, following
intravenous inoculation we used intravital microscopy to characterize vascular attachment and transmigration
in skin and joint-proximal tissue. These studies revealed that adhesins BBK32 and VlsE account for virtually all
of the transient Bb-endothelium binding occurring minutes after inoculation, termed “Meeting” interactions. A
distinct set of adhesins, DbpB/A, OspC, and P66, mediate contacts required for invasion into extravascular
joint space after 24 hours (hr), termed “Transmigrating” interactions. Using isogenic strain sets that have
acquired or lost specific adhesive activities in multiple short-term and long-term infection models we showed
roles for five of the six Meeting or Transmigrating adhesins in short-term tissue localization and/or long-term
colonization in other murine infection models. While Transmigrating adhesins do not promote “Meeting”
interactions, our discovery of enhanced adhesive capacity of the endothelium as infection progresses has
helped clarify why different adhesins have roles at different stages of infection. Within hr, “Endothelial
Activation” permits BBK32- and VlsE-independent (“Greeting”) interactions. After ~24 hr “Endothelial
Potentiation” occurs, reflected by the ability of the joint vasculature to support Bb transmigration. Although both
OspC and P66 function as Transmigrating adhesins, only P66, an integrin-binding adhesin that alters
transcription in cultured endothelial cells, is also Potentiating, i.e., required to promote the rapid transmigration
of a second Bb strain. Activation is mimicked by exogenous treatment of mice with several cytokines produced
by infected mice, but potentiation is seen only with TNF-α, MCP-1 or IL-10. These findings reveal previously
unrecognized steps that are critical for Bb spread and provide a means to distinguish roles for each adhesin in
distinct infection stages: Meeting, Greeting, Potentiating, Transmigrating and Colonizing. In Aim 1 we will
identify known adhesins that facilitate Greeting interactions; to better prioritize our adhesin list, we propose a
genome-wide screen that may also identify novel adhesins. In Aim 2 we will clarify the roles of known (and, if
applicable, novel) adhesins in endothelial Potentiation and Transmigration. Our use of rigorous genetic
analyses in infection models from visualization of key interactions in vivo to quantitative analysis of Bb at
different stages of infection will result in detailed understanding of a critical facet of Bb biology: dissemination."

10755649,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypertension stimulates cardiac fibroblast (CF) expansion, activation, and excess extracellular matrix (ECM)
production. Although there are no approved treatments for cardiac fibrosis, angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibition (ACEi) limits CF activation and ECM accumulation. Recent findings from the laboratory of the PI
demonstrate that resident CFs, once considered functionally homogeneous, consist of physiologically distinct
populations that differentiate to diverse phenotypes in response to pressure overload. The premise for this
application is based on these findings in which hypertensive rats were transiently treated with an ACEi prior to
single cell RNA sequencing on resident CFs. Pre-treatment with ACEi shifts CF subpopulations to generate
homeostatic CFs with a reduced capacity for fibrosis. This effect persists after treatment is stopped, indicating
memory is retained. The proposed studies will reveal the mechanisms by which CF subpopulations shift to
determine how to reprogram CFs to display a homeostatic, less fibrogenic phenotype. Following ACEi,
homeostatic CFs comprise the largest subpopulation of resident CFs and are the least fibrogenic. Trajectory
analysis revealed a gateway CF subpopulation that is the immediate precursor to activated CFs, and this
gateway cluster was the most depleted by ACEi. Gateway CFs were defined by high expression of Spp1,
encoding for the protein osteopontin, which induces several pro-fibrotic genes and represents a critical target
candidate to maintain the activated CF pool. ACEi altered expression of epigenetic genes, indicating changes
in chromatin structure may drive the persistent shift from gateway to homeostatic CF subpopulations. These
compelling preliminary results led to the central hypothesis: transient reduction in angiotensin II signaling alters
CF memory to protect against left ventricle (LV) fibrosis by fibroblast subpopulation-specific reprogramming of
chromatin structure to shift an osteopontin-producing gateway subpopulation toward a homeostatic
subpopulation with low fibrogenic capacity. To test the hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1) elucidate the degree to which reduction in angiotensin II signaling mediates the persistent shift in
resident CF physiology that protects from future fibrosis; Aim 2) determine the impact of chromatin structural
modification on shifting the gateway cluster toward the homeostatic cluster; and Aim 3) ascertain the degree to
which reduction in osteopontin mediates the shift to a less fibrogenic phenotype. In this application, the
research team uses a multidisciplinary approach employing in vivo and in vitro methodologies to test the
hypothesis. Successful completion of these experiments will determine whether reduction in angiotensin II
signaling mediates the expansion of a subset of homeostatic CFs that renders the LV resistant to fibrosis. It is
expected that the key drivers regulating the shift from a gateway to a homeostatic subpopulation of CFs will be
identified. Impact: These anticipated findings will have a positive impact in developing CF-targeted therapies for
the treatment and prevention of fibrotic remodeling that underlies heart disease."
10755741,"Project Summary
Stressful life events lead to increased risk of addiction and other psychiatric disorders, while daily exercise may
help reduce susceptibility to addiction and mitigate the influence of stress. Maladaptive attribution of incentive
salience to environmental cues associated with rewards, such as addictive drugs or palatable foods, is thought
drive cue-induced craving and relapse, one of the core symptoms of addictive disorders. Yet, how stress and
exercise differentially regulate the reward learning processes that drive assignment of incentive value to
environmental stimuli remains poorly understood. Thus, the goal of the current project is to determine the
impact of stress and daily exercise on the mechanisms and rules governing cue-reward learning.
Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a critical role in reward-based learning. These
neurons acquire transient bursting responses to reward-predicting cues during repeated cue-reward pairing,
thereby assigning incentive value to those cues. We have previously described Hebbian plasticity of NMDA
receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto dopamine neurons that may, in part, contribute to the
acquisition of conditioned bursting responses. Using rats, this proposal will test the hypothesis that stress and
daily exercise will exert opposing influences on NMDA plasticity and learning of drug/food-associated cues,
thus enabling daily exercise to buffer the impact of stress. In Aim 1, we will ask how stress exposure regulates
the magnitude, rate, and timing dependence of cue-reward learning. In Aim 2, we will determine the differential
roles of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and norepinephrine (NE), two major mediators of stress
responses, in regulating cue-reward learning and NMDA plasticity. In these two aims, we will also investigate
the influence of the psychostimulant amphetamine, which causes robust NE release in the brain and is a well-
known risk factor for the development of concurrent non-drug addictions. In Aim 3, we will ask how daily
running experience affects learning and plasticity in a manner that counteracts the effects of stress and
amphetamine examined in the first two aims. Chemogenetic manipulations of the activity of noradrenergic
neurons projecting to the VTA, together with measurement of NE levels in the VTA with microdialysis, will be
performed to further probe the role of noradrenergic signaling. This project will allow determination of a
plasticity mechanism that may contribute to the opposing effects of stress and exercise on addiction
vulnerability and may lead to new preventive strategies for addiction in high-risk individuals."
10755655,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Endothelial dysfunction is highlighted as an early marker of vascular abnormality preceding
cerebral aneurysm formation, but the molecular events behind this transformation remain
unclear. Inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2) mediate vascular disease, but its
role in cerebral aneurysm pathophysiology is unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that IL-2 is
expressed in human cerebral aneurysm tissue and induces a phenotypic switch in endothelial
cell (EC) function from the maintenance of vasomotor activity, to promotion of inflammation and
matrix remodeling. We have also found that inhibition of the IL-2 target protein mTOR with
rapamycin reduced aneurysm progression and rupture in a mouse cerebral aneurysm model.
Collectively this preliminary data suggests a vital role of the IL-2/mTOR pathway in aneurysm
progression. The objective of this grant is to characterize the role of IL-2 activated mTOR in EC
dysfunction and aneurysm development and progression. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that IL-2/mTOR inhibition promotes repopulation of EC and decreases inflammation,
which halts aneurysm progression and promotes vascular healing. In this proposal, we will
determine the role of IL-2 activated mTOR in aneurysm formation, progression, and rupture and
define the mechanisms by which IL-2/mTOR promotes EC dysfunction (Aim 1). We will treat
experimental aneurysms with a novel stent delivering controlled release of the IL-2/mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin to determine if IL-2/mTOR inhibition reverses EC dysfunction while
decreasing inflammation (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine IL-2 expression, mTOR activation
and EC dysfunction in human cerebral aneurysmal tissue and intra-aneurysmal blood and if
rapamycin treatment prior to surgery reduces IL-2/mTOR signaling and EC dysfunction (Aim 3).
The proposed research is innovative in that successful completion of this project will determine
the events behind EC dysfunction which lead to aneurysm progression and will help develop
novel minimally invasive therapeutic strategies for aneurysm obliteration."
10755745,"Project Summary/Abstract
Anhedonia in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently fails to respond to available
psychosocial and pharmacological treatments and has been robustly linked to marked disability as well as
suicidal risk. A well-validated model of anhedonia suggests that anhedonia may result from prolonged
exposure to stress (i.e. “stress-induced anhedonia”) as manifested by chronic behavioral inhibition and a failure
to pursue rewards. One proposed mechanism of stress-induced anhedonia is alteration of glutamate function
in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To investigate this hypothesis in humans, we recently conducted a series
of studies using single-voxel MR spectroscopy measures of glutamate in mPFC before and after an acute
stress challenge. We found that mPFC glutamate increased in healthy controls with low levels of stress, but
decreased glutamate responses in controls with high levels of stress. Interestingly, in unmedicated MDD
patients, we found no change or an increase in mPFC glutamate following stress. This altered mPFC
glutamate response to stress in MDD patients was in turn correlated with negative expectations of future
events and thus may be a mechanism by which chronic stress is translated into impaired reward valuation and
reduced motivation. Consistent with this notion, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to
improve anhedonic symptoms in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. Nevertheless, the role of mPFC and
other regions in this altered glutamate stress response in MDD or its association with RDoC positive valence
constructs that underlie anhedonia has yet to be fully established. Moreover, whether reversal of this altered
glutamate response in MDD underlies the effects of ketamine on anhedonia is unknown. Thus, the current
proposal seeks to use whole-brain multi-modal 3D ultrahigh resolution spectroscopic MRI (SMRI) and fMRI
assessments of RDoC constructs related to reward valuation and motivation to examine glutamate responses
to stress and its relationship with symptoms and neurocognitive correlates of anhedonia before and after a
ketamine challenge in MDD patients. We will use a novel SMRI sequence to measure glutamate before and
after an acute stressor and a no-stress control in 60 healthy controls and 80 MDD patients. After baseline
scanning, MDD patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine or placebo, and
complete follow-up scans at 24-hours and 2 weeks. By establishing an altered glutamate response to stress as
a mechanism for anhedonic effects of chronic stress and its reversal by ketamine, these data will be able to
serve as a drug discovery platform for other pharmacologic agents targeting the glutamate system to treat
stress-induced anhedonia."

Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high intensity focused ultrasound ablation (MRgFUSA) is a transformative
neurosurgical approach that produces a precise and visible lesion, such that ‘target’ engagement is clear, and
offers an innovative and mechanistic strategy to correct an underlying neuropathophysiology. Unlike current
neuromodulation techniques (DBS, TMS, TDCS), MRgFUSA’s thermal effects can be harnessed to non-invasively
and precisely target deep brain structures and circuits using the Exablate 4000 (Insightec). MRgFUSA has most
recently been applied to the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) which has emerged as promising intervention for
medication-refractory partial or focal-onset epilepsy, particularly originating from the limbic temporal lobe (e.g.,
amygdala). Of key relevance here is that the ATN has extensive functional and structural connectivity to the
amygdala and that partial epilepsy is often associated with enhanced fear behaviors and clinical anxiety, which
is often mediated by exaggerated amygdala reactivity to threat. Moreover, MPI Phan and others have shown that
amygdala reactivity to threat, exaggerated at baseline/pre-treatment in anxiety disorders (ADs), can be modified
and “normalized” by conventional treatments. It stands to reason that MRgFUSA to the ATN could attenuate
anxiety symptoms and do so by reducing amygdala reactivity to threat. Uniquely, MPI neurosurgeon Krishna has
obtained a FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to ablate the ATN for medically refractory
epilepsy, providing an unprecedented opportunity to test this notion. This discovery would have exceptionally
high impact because existing treatments for ADs are modestly effective, and relapse rates post-treatment are
notoriously high and long-term remission is heavily dependent on voluntary continuation of treatment,
particularly pharmacotherapy. There is an ongoing urgent need to develop new treatments for ADs that precisely
targets an underlying pathological mechanism quickly and permanently. To set the stage for and de-risk future
clinical trials and in accordance with the U01 RFA requirements using small (n<10) studies, we propose a first-
in-human, proof-of-concept experiment to an existing participant pool who are already undergoing MRgFUSA-
ATN for epilepsy (using the existing FDA-approved IDE) and for the purpose of this proposal include only those
with high anxiety (as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, HAM-A; HAMA score > 17) to track the
immediate (intraoperative) effect of MRgFUSA-ANT on amygdala reactivity and short- and long-term reduction
in anxiety symptoms over the course of 12 months. This project seeks to answer 3 questions: 1) Is MRgFUSA-
ATN safe and tolerable, in a high anxiety cohort; 2) Can MRgFUSA-ATN reduce amygdala reactivity to threat;
and 3) Can MRgFUSA-ATN reduce anxiety/fear symptoms by post-operative day 1, and how durable are the anti-
anxiety effects? If successful, this proposal will provide a guiding and transformative approach towards
developing fast-acting, permanent but non-invasive neurosurgical treatments for patients suffering from anxiety
and other mental illnesses and inform, optimize and de-risk future clinical MRgFUSA studies."

In recent years, artificial intelligence has enabled automated systems to meet or exceed the performance of
clinical experts across a wide variety of medical imaging tasks, in applications ranging from disease diagnosis
using Chest X-Rays to survival analyses using histopathology slides. All current automated echocardiography
systems – much like human echocardiography reads – are inherently reductionist in nature; a complex sequence
and pattern of cardiac contraction is reduced to an outline of one or more chambers, from which a few global
metrics of heart function are then calculated. Despite the staggering increase in usable data, the vast majority of
information contained in time-resolved echocardiography videos remain woefully underutilized. As opposed to
treating echocardiography studies as videos intended solely for visual interpretation, the ‘radiomics’ approach
treats medical images as high-dimensional datasets to be mined with advanced computational tools. The overall
goals of this project are to further develop and validate our novel, generalizable, multi-modal artificial intelligence
(AI) platform for analyzing time resolved echocardiography studies, to address this underutilization.
The impact of such an ECHO AI system is immediately perceptible in the field of heart failure. An estimated 6.5
million people suffer from heart failure in the United States. Across the spectrum of severity in this disease,
echocardiography remains the cornerstone of screening and clinical diagnosis, a guide for medical management
and pharmacotherapy, and an essential tool for planning acute lifesaving surgical interventions. We propose to
build on our preliminary research and ready access to high quality paired echocardiographic and clinical datasets
to achieve the following goals: 1) Develop a surgical decision support system for end-stage heart failure patients
considered for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant. 2) Expand and generalize our ECHO AI tools to
enable downstream prediction of long-term survival and development of heart failure, in both asymptomatic
individuals and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 3) Cloud and hardware integration of our ECHO AI
platform. The end result of our research will be a powerful ECHO AI tool with that is translatable, and integrated
into clinical practice."

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is currently the leading cause of vision loss in working age adults. With the
anticipated growth of the diabetic population, the number of visually impaired diabetic people who cannot work
or care for themselves will continue to be a major public health concern. Vision loss prevention due to DR
requires early diagnosis, regular monitoring, and timely therapeutic intervention. Currently, the unmet clinical
needs are the ability to prospectively identify which diabetic individuals will develop DR, progress to vision-
threatening stages, or respond favorably to therapy. A generally recognized factor that contributes to the
development of vision-threatening pathologies due to DR is retinal hypoxia, which can subsequently impair
oxygen metabolism. Maintenance of oxygen metabolism is essential for energy production that is vital for cells
to survive and perform visual processing. Inner retinal oxygen metabolism is maintained by the balance of
inner retinal oxygen delivery and oxygen extraction fraction. Although the retinal tissue and microvasculature
have been extensively studied from an anatomical perspective, there is limited information about alterations in
retinal oxygen metabolic function and energy production due to DR. The research proposal will overcome this
limitation by an innovative, quantitative, and comprehensive multimodal imaging approach to elucidate
alterations in oxygen metabolism and defects in regulatory mechanisms that occur at progressive stages of
DR, with application of treatment, and in relation to retinal capillary plexus morphology. The specific aims are
to: 1) identify inner retina oxygen-metabolic metrics that are associated with stages of DR and indicative of
past glycemic control; 2) determine pre-treatment inner retina oxygen-metabolic metrics that are predictive of
treatment outcome; 3) elucidate associations among inner retina oxygen-metabolic metrics, capillary plexus
morphology and cell layer thickness at stages of DR. The findings will broaden knowledge of DR
pathophysiology, improve diagnostic and prognostic evaluation, and propel search for new preventative and
therapeutic interventions. The research study can potentially transform clinical assessment of DR, thereby
significantly impacting the quality of life of diabetic people and the cost of caring for visually impaired
individuals."
10755673,"Preeclampsia (preE), defined as the onset of hypertension paired with proteinuria and/or other
organ complication after 20 weeks of gestation, is a common pregnancy complication affecting
2-8% of pregnancies worldwide. The condition is even more common among mothers with
chronic mild hypertension at pregnancy onset (affecting >25%). Importantly, preE confers a
significantly increased risk of maternal and fetal morbidity including cardiovascular
complications, preterm delivery, low birth weight and even death. Furthermore, recent studies
demonstrate that a history of a preE is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease for the mother later in life. The pathophysiology of preE is not completely understood
but abnormal placentation, vascular dysfunction and oxidative stress is thought to cause
maternal endothelial dysfunction resulting in the onset of clinical symptoms. To date the only
definitive diagnosis is through blood pressure and urine protein measurement in the second or
third trimester. However, the pathology is suspected to start in the first trimester and earlier
identification can allow for better treatment and outcomes. The epigenome is recognized as an
important driver of the gene expression changes necessary to support pregnancy. Numerous
epigenomic studies of placental tissue have identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs, a
type of epigenetic modification) associated with preE in genes and pathways suspected to
underlie disease. A handful of studies have identified changes in the maternal epigenome from
blood which could be identifiable earlier in pregnancy. Overall, additional research is needed to
determine if methylation sites in maternal blood cells are useful to understand preE risk. This
study will leverage the rich resource of the Chronic Hypertension And Pregnancy (CHAP) study
designed to determine the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy.
Our ancillary study will use a nested case-control design (650 cases and 650 controls) to
discover CpGs and DMRs for preE using existing data and blood samples. Findings will be
replicated among participants from the Magee Obstetric Maternal & Infant Biobank database
(N~650). PreE CpGs and DMRs (validated through replication) will be further tested for
association with maternal cardiovascular outcomes in CHAP as well as in parous women from
observational cohorts with existing metylation data from the National Heart Lung and Blood
Institute’s Transomics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. The proposed research
seeks to better understand the pathophysiology of preE and identify potential new biomarkers to
facilitate early detection, management, and treatment of this serious pregnancy condition."
10768550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance and Background: Children with Down syndrome (DS), irrespective of having other risk factors,
are at increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Worldwide RSV is the most common cause
of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in infants and young children. Early life RSV LRTI further adversely
influences the developing lung and immune system, and sets up children with DS for an increased risk of other
long term respiratory diseases. Children with DS may therefore potentially benefit from RSV
immunoprophylaxis, the only currently available pharmacological strategy to prevent RSV LRTI. However,
insufficient data limit routine use of RSV immunoprophylaxis in children with DS to the same qualifying
conditions as children without DS (premature birth < 29 weeks, chronic lung disease, or hemodynamically
significant congenital heart disease) per American Academy of Pediatrics guideline.
Objectives, Hypothesis and Specific Aims: Our overarching hypotheses are: 1) In children with DS RSV
LRTI early in life increases the risk of respiratory morbidity through age 6 years, 2) Administration of RSV
immunoprophylaxis reduces RSV LRTI morbidity and later respiratory morbidity caused by RSV LRTI early in
life, and 3) Administration of RSV immunoprophylaxis offsets the costs of both RSV LRTI related
hospitalization during the first 2 years of life and respiratory morbidity through age 6 years. To test the
hypotheses, we will: 1) Determine and quantify the prevalence of severe RSV LRTI in the first 2 years of life
and the association of RSV LRTI with respiratory morbidity through age 6 years; 2) Characterize the receipt of,
safety of, and adherence to RSV immunoprophylaxis; 3) Determine the short-term effectiveness of RSV
immunoprophylaxis on reducing RSV LRTI healthcare visits and the long-term effectiveness on childhood
respiratory outcomes, 4) Determine the cost-effectiveness of RSV immunoprophylaxis administration in
reducing RSV LRTI and later respiratory morbidity in children with DS.
Research Design: We will conduct a large population-based birth cohort study of 4,063 children with DS born
1996-2018 and enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid Program or the Department of Defense military healthcare
system, the largest cohort ever conducted in this population.
Impact: The knowledge gaps about the burden of RSV infection and the effectiveness of RSV
immunoprophylaxis in children with DS leave policy makers, clinicians and patients unable to make informed
clinical decisions. The proposed research, the largest study ever conducted, is in direct response to the
American Academy of Pediatrics call for adequately powered studies to answer the question and inform policy
on effectiveness of RSV immunoprophylaxis in this high risk population. Results from this study will provide
information in informing clinical care and policy, and more importantly may improve human health in children
with DS with a readily available and safe therapy."
10768552,"This CDA-2 application proposes a 5-year training program to develop the career of Dr. Nicholas Maurice as
he investigates mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogenicity with a focus on how the interaction
between bacterial virulence factors and host mitochondrial oxidative DNA damage and repair modulates the
innate immune response to pneumococcal infection. His primary mentor, Dr. Ruxana Sadikot, is an
internationally-recognized expert in the field of host defense against bacterial pathogens. His mentorship team
includes other senior investigators at the Atlanta VA and Emory University with complementary areas of
expertise that will contribute to Dr. Maurice’s career development. In addition, Dr. Maurice will benefit from an
excellent training environment at the Atlanta VA Medical Center and Emory University with a proven track
record of success developing the careers of young investigators. Previous published research by Dr. Maurice
identified key virulence factors of the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that impair innate
immunity through attenuation of host epithelial cell mitochondrial bioenergetic function and mitochondrial
biogenesis. He demonstrated that genetic and pharmacologic strategies that enhanced mitochondrial
biogenesis could promote epithelial host defense. Based on his work investigating mitochondrial biogenesis,
Dr. Maurice began investigating another mitochondrial quality control process namely mitochondrial DNA
repair. He also began focusing on the bacteria S. pneumoniae given the significant health threat it poses to the
veteran population. Preliminary research has identified the novel finding that S. pneumoniae induces oxidative
mitochondrial DNA damage and attenuates expression of the DNA repair enzyme, OGG1, in host epithelial
cells. Additional data suggest that this pathway may have significant consequences on the epithelial host
response to pneumococcal infection. This work has led to the hypothesis that pneumococcal virulence factors
such as pneumolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, impair host defense through oxidative mitochondrial
DNA damage, but targeted enhancement of mitochondrial DNA repair can ameliorate cellular dysfunction and
improve the host response to pneumococcal infection. This proposal encompasses three aims. First, the
pneumococcal virulence factors responsible for the induction of oxidative mitochondrial DNA injury and
attenuation of OGG1 expression in host epithelial cells will be identified. Second, the role of reactive oxygen
species-mediated mitochondrial damage and OGG1-mediated mitochondrial DNA repair in the epithelial host
response to S. pneumoniae will be defined. Third, in pre-clinical translational studies, novel therapeutic
strategies targeting mitochondrial OGG1 will be tested in an in vivo model of pneumococcal pneumonia to
determine if enhancing mitochondrial DNA repair reflects an efficacious treatment strategy for S. pneumoniae
infection. These studies will provide novel insights regarding host-pneumococcal interactions that have the
potential for translation into human clinical studies. Further, the training necessary to achieve these aims will
provide Dr. Maurice the skills necessary to develop into an independent physician scientist working at the
intersection of multidisciplinary fields of microbiology, mitochondrial biology, pulmonary innate immunity, and
redox biology. After being awarded a VA VISN7 Research Development Award, Dr. Maurice became a staff
physician at the Atlanta VA Medical Center and joined the faculty of Emory University School of Medicine. He
is at a critical stage in his career development and the support of a CDA-2 will enable him to meet his goal of
becoming an independently-funded physician-scientist with a goal of improving the health of the susceptible
veteran population at risk for acquiring life-threatening infections."
10768553,"Hypertension (HTN) affects millions of adults in the U.S and leads to end organ damage. This study is
designed to test whether dysregulation of the cholesterol (chol) efflux pathway affects sodium (Na) dependent
rise in systemic blood pressure (BP), both of which are risk factors for mortality.
 The chol efflux pathway is comprised of two pathways, (1) facilitated chol transport or (2) the active
transport pathway regulated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) and
ABC transporter G1 (ABCG1). ABCA1 polymorphisms, that repress chol efflux, are associated with HTN while
non-functional mutations of ABCA1 cause Tangiers disease with early atherosclerosis.
 High Na diets increase tubular flow that stimulate paracrine pathways to suppress Na absorption and,
thus, enhance Na excretion; as a corollary, targeted deletion of flow-mediated autocrine-paracrine pathways
enhance renal Na avidity and HTN. Renal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) knock out (KO) causes Na sensitive
HTN. Moreover, increases in tubular flow induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) activity/protein and collecting duct
(CD) PGE2 release to inhibit epithelial Na channel (ENaC). The effects of flow on COX2 and PGE2 are muted
in CDs isolated from mice fed a 1% chol vs. no chol diet. The chol content from chol fed mice doubles versus
controls. ABCA1 ablation in CDs, increases CD chol, stimulates ENaC, reduces urinary ATP and raises BP.
 ABCA1 ablation also predisposes to an inflammatory renal microenvironment. Increases of LR free
chol enhance ligand-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling which is linked to tubular Na transport.
Elevated LR free chol recruit TLR4 to LRs, increasing LR TLR4 density, to augment signaling. Transepithelial
Na transport stimulates Na/K-ATPase mediated ATP demand driving mitochondrial oxidative respiration,
oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. TLR4 is stimulated by stress induced ligands including lipid
peroxides leading to an inflammatory and Na avid phenotype. Thus, we hypothesize that excess tubular
PM/LR chol content in ABCA1 deficient tubules will induce Na avidity and inflammation due to muted
flow mediated natriuretic pathways, primed TLR4 responses, and transport dependent oxidative
respiration and stress to form the Na sensitive phenotype. This will be tested in the specific aims (SAs):
SA1. To evaluate whether depletion or deletion of tubular ABCA1 expression contributes to the
development of renal Na avidity and HTN
SA1a. Test whether tubular ABCA1 ablation is sufficient or dietary chol is necessary to induce Na sensitivity.
SA1b. Determine whether serum LDL level modifies the Na avidity by crossing ABCA1fl/fl (ABCA1 FF) mice into
the apolipoprotein E (APOE) deficient mouse
SA2. Test whether chol affects PM/LR function to repress flow mediated Na excretory pathways and
augment TLR4 inflammatory signaling to promote anti-natriuresis and HTN
SA2a. Test whether chol incorporation into LRs directly enhances Na transport and represses FSS induced
natriuretic factors to augment Na absorption using molecular, physiologic and electrophysiologic methods.
SA2.b Determine whether altering the PM chol, and specifically, LR chol effects TLR4 density and activation,
and, hence, inflammatory markers and transepithelial Na transport.
SA2.c Test whether pharmacologic PM chol depletion reverses Na sensitivity and inflammation.
SA3. Greater rates of Na transport in ABCA1 deficient mice increase oxidative respiration and stress
that activates the ferropotic pathway, based on single nuclei RNAseq (snRNAseq) data.
SA3a. Determine whether greater Na/K-ATPase activity is driving greater mitochondrial respiration and
oxidative stress in ABCA1 deficient kidneys.
SA3b. Characterize if increased mitochondrial respiration and stress augments ferroptosis in tubular epithelia."
10768634,"Summary: HIV-1 Neurotoxicity: Mechanism & Modulation by Cannabinoids
Almost half of HIV-infected individuals experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) which
manifests as a deterioration of cognitive function; currently, there is no treatment. Our long-term goal is to
inform clinical care of HAND patients by identifying novel neurophysiological changes that underlie HIV-
associated cognitive decline, thereby identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. In the previous funding
period we found that HIV proteins and inflammatory cytokines, factors released by HIV-infected cells, altered
synaptic networks, revealing novel targets for drug development. This new proposal is oriented around
preliminary data describing novel changes in the endocannabinoid (eCB) system during exposure to the HIV
protein Tat. Exposure to Tat impaired eCB-mediated suppression of neurotransmitter release at excitatory but
not inhibitory synapses. The eCB system suppresses aberrant synaptic activity thus, degradation of this
neuroprotective system may exacerbate the synapse loss that correlates with cognitive decline in HAND. The
goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms driving changes in eCB signaling during HIV
neurotoxicity and to evaluate the consequences of these changes on network and cognitive function.
In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanism of HIV Tat-induced impairment of the eCB system. We hypothesize
that HIV Tat evokes release of inflammatory cytokines from glia to activate neuronal signaling pathways that
impair cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R)-mediated presynaptic inhibition. Pharmacological and molecular
approaches will be used to determine the contribution of inflammatory cytokines and their downstream
signaling pathways to impaired CB1R function. These studies will provide insight into the cellular actions of the
HIV neurotoxin Tat and have broad implications for the effects of neuroinflammation on the eCB system.
In Aim 2 we will determine how unbalanced eCB signaling affects network activity and cognitive function during
exposure to HIV Tat. We hypothesize that exposure to HIV Tat downregulates CB1R-mediated presynaptic
inhibition at excitatory synapses, thereby increasing vulnerability to excitotoxic synaptic activity. Our hypothesis
predicts that in transgenic mice expressing Tat eCB signaling will be impaired in synaptic recordings from brain
slices, and the loss of eCB signaling will increase the frequency of epileptiform activity detected in EEG
recordings. The contribution of this aberrant activity to Tat-induced cognitive decline will be determined. These
studies will relate changes in eCB signaling to network excitability in a model of HAND and link the aberrant
synaptic activity induced by Tat to cognitive decline.
Completion of these studies will identify a pathway induced by HIV Tat that unbalances eCB signaling. These
studies will provide a foundation to explore the clinical potential of drugs that normalize excitability to improve
cognitive function in HAND. Finally, the changes in eCB signaling that occur under neuroinflammatory
conditions could significantly alter the effects of exogenous cannabinoids on CNS function."

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are the most common temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain condition;
however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. As such, TMJ pain has long confounded
medical and dental health care providers, and current treatment of chronic TMJ pain are often unsatisfactory.
Our recent work suggests that gut microbiome perturbation and reduction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in
the gut may be involved in the pathogenesis of TMJ pain and recovering SCFAs to normal levels could be
developed into a new complementary non-opioid therapy for such pain. Our preliminary results further suggest
that SCFAs may contribute to TMJ pain via an epigenetic mechanism. In this project, we will reveal specific
epigenetic mechanisms by which SCFAs regulate chronic TMJ pain. Our hypothesis is that gut microbiome
perturbation-produced SCFA reduction enhances chronic TMJ pain by epigenetically suppressing Gad2
transcription, and that SCFA supplementation inhibits such pain via normalizing the epigenetic regulation. To
address this central hypothesis, we will conduct the studies proposed in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine the therapeutic effect of SCFA supplementation on chronic TMJ pain. In Aim 2, we will identify the
epigenetic mechanism that underlies the role of SCFAs in chronic TMJ pain. In Aim 3, we will define the role of
vagus nerve in SCFA-mediated epigenetic regulation of chronic TMJ pain. Together, we expect to reveal a critical
epigenetic mechanism that underlies the role of SCFAs in TMJ pain. The proposed research is significant since
it will demonstrate whether and how SCFAs regulate TMJ pain. The proposed studies are innovative since these
studies will identify a previously unrecognized role for SCFAs in the epigenetic regulation of TMJ pain."

Potential long-term effects of tackle football and other contact sports have created significant public health
concerns about the risk of childhood participation. Considering the retrospective and cross-sectional nature of
prior work, there are critical knowledge gaps regarding the causality of youth tackle football participation and
subsequent clinical outcomes that preclude decision-making at the patient and policy level. Further, modifiable
risk factors (e.g., neuromuscular control) may influence exposure to and thus, outcomes from football-related
neurotrauma, but prevention remains understudied. Here we overcome some of the previous barriers to progress
in this field by acquiring a “true baseline” for athletes before they begin their first season of tackle football and
following them longitudinally across the first year of participation. We received funding from Ohio State’s Chronic
Brain Injury Program and successfully collected pilot data on 50 youth tackle football players (ages 8-12 years);
these data form the basis of our current proposal. Aim 1 will identify risk factors for higher exposure to football-
related neurotrauma. We will measure football-related neurotrauma exposure in first-year youth tackle football
players during all practices and games using instrumented mouthguards. We will use handheld dynamometry to
measure neck strength and will measure neuromuscular control through visual, vestibular, and reaction time
testing. Aim 2 will determine the effects of football-related neurotrauma exposure on neurodevelopment in
children with no previous tackle football exposure. We will enroll children who are registered for, but have not
yet begun participating in youth tackle football, as well as children registered for non-contact sports and children
not playing any sports. Aim 2a will determine short-term changes in cognitive function and brain structure and
function caused by football-related neurotrauma exposure from pre-season to post-season. Aim 2b will
determine longer-term changes across the first year of participation by examining players during the off-season
just prior to the start of the next season. Aim 2c will determine what factors (e.g., football-related neurotrauma
exposure, exposure to adverse childhood events, pre-existing neurodevelopmental disorders) contribute to
differences from typical development. We hypothesize that youth tackle football exposes children to repetitive
neurotrauma during a period of rapid neurodevelopment, resulting in observable cognitive impairments and
structural and functional changes in the brain, most likely in attentional control networks. Our proposal combines
a state-of-the-art approach to determining the effects of football-related neurotrauma on neurodevelopment, a
productive collaboration with youth sports programs in Ohio, community engagement and outreach, and a
multidisciplinary team of experts. The societal and clinical impact of these findings cannot be overstated. In
quantifying football-related neurotrauma exposure (Aim 1) and its effects on neurodevelopment (Aim 2) across
the first year of youth tackle football participation, our expected outcomes will inform community stakeholders
and policy-makers in their appraisal of the cost and benefit of children participating in youth tackle football."
10885189,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, rapidly progressing, neuromotor disease
characterized by degeneration of upper (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) affecting
~6/100,000 people in the US. ALS cases are projected to rise 69% globally (∼222K in 2015 to
∼376K in 2040). Most individuals with ALS die within 3-5 years of diagnosis, and as many as one
third die within the first year. Yet, the time from onset of ALS symptoms to receive a diagnosis
generally ranges from 8-15 months further crippling an individual’s quality of life, ability to plan,
and treatment options in the already short time that remains. Finding a robust and reliable
biomarker of corticospinal dysfunction in ALS is of paramount importance to improve diagnostic
certainty at earlier stages, manage disease heterogeneity, track disease progression, improve
patient stratification, and evaluate efficacy in clinical trials. Transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) is an effective tool to assess the functional integrity of UMN and LMN by measuring the
degree of corticospinal drive – a measure called facilitation. Because the corticospinal system
degenerates in ALS, the same tool can be used to quantify the degree of Failure of Facilitation as
an indicator of the disease, paving the way for future studies to use this as an early biomarker of
disease onset. In Aim 1 of the proposed project, we will test two key hypotheses in healthy
individuals about the underlying relationship between facilitation in the corticospinal system and
behavior. Then in Aim 2 of the proposed project, we will test whether individuals with ALS exhibit
Failure of Facilitation, compared to those who are healthy or have an ALS mimic disorder, and
whether the degree of Failure of Facilitation relates to the severity of the disease assessed with
standard clinical batteries and neurophysiological tests of UMN dysfunction. This project will have
significant scientific and clinical impact by advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms
for motor facilitation for voluntary force generation and providing an initial proof of concept that
failure of facilitation is a useful biomarker of UMN dysfunction and disease progression in ALS."
10904765,"PROJECT SUMMARY. While Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death, there is still no
pharmacologic treatment on the market that slows or stops neuronal damage in AD. Apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE4)
is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD and one that roughly a quarter of the general population
carries. Importantly, further precluding effective therapeutic development is the lack of human-based models that
can recapitulate AD pathology with all the brain-resident cell types in the immune-glial-neurovascular unit, cap-
turing critical cell non-autonomous effects, including in inflammatory and lipid dysregulation, and blood brain
barrier (BBB)-mediated transport of nutrients and therapeutics. To address these limitations, in an ambitious
moonshot project in the first phase of my postdoctoral work, I have engineered a novel brain-mimetic matrix
(NeuroMatrix) that supports the co-culture of all 7 brain cell types from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem
cells with mature phenotypes to form a multi-cellular integrated brain model (miBRAIN). This model recapitulates
APOE4-associated dysregulation and AD pathological hallmarks of neuronal hyperexcitability, amyloid accumu-
lation, phosphorylated tau burden, etc. Further, I have developed a novel constriction-minimizing microfluidic
device that enables perfusable vasculature within neurovascular units self-assembled in NeuroMatrix. I propose
here to: (Aim 1) leverage the miBRAIN platform to construct a diverse “in vitro patient cohort” across
APOE genotype with isogenic lines to probe APOE4-specific effects and conduct important validation of
the model as I aim to hone this platform technology for broad utility and (Aim 2) engineer 3D-miBRAIN-
Chips by combining my novel microfluidic devices with the miBRAIN and successively integrating each cell type
towards a fully perfusable BBB within miBRAIN culture and harness them to functionally assess BBB perme-
ability and selectivity across patient cell lines and APOE status. After consultation with the Program Officer
and given my long-term goals, I have decided to further focus on (Aim 3) investigating the best path forward
for deploying this technology for maximal utility, including development of a business plan and identification
of potential partners and focus applications. This work thus could result in important insights for AD mechanistic
understanding, of immediate relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases associated with APOE4 risk, while
developing a well-validated 3D-miBRAIN-Chip platform technology that is an integrated immune-glial-neurovas-
cular unit with patient-specific genetics and biomimetic phenotypes and functions that could be of great utility for
therapeutic development across CNS pathologies. Simultaneously, it provides vital training in research meth-
ods (platform development, bioinformatics, lipidomic and inflammation analyses, mentoring from expert Co-
Mentors and Scientific Advisory Committee) and career development (immersive entrepreneurial training,
niche-specific coursework, mentoring from expert Co-Mentors and Entrepreneurial Advisory Committee, pursuit
of ambitious independent vision) that will make a marked difference in launching my independent career."
10910218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of
malignant primary brain tumor in adults with a median age of onset at 68-70 years old. IDHwt GBM patients
represent >70% of all GBM patient diagnoses, and among those individuals, older adults ≥65 years of age have
a significantly decreased median overall survival (mOS) as compared to younger IDHwt GBM patients after
treatment with standard of care radiation (RT) and temozolomide. We have also studied our ongoing clinical trial
NCT04047706 and determined that newly-diagnosed older adult IDHwt MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM
patients who are treated with RT, nivolumab (PD-1 mAb), and BMS-986205 [IDO enzyme inhibitor (IDOi)] have
a decreased mOS as compared to similarly-treated younger GBM patients (p<0.0007). Strikingly, >33% of the
youngest patients in this trial are still alive at 36 months post-treatment initiation. The poor prognosis of older
adult GBM patients starkly contrasts with individuals who undergo treatment for other forms of aggressive cancer
that arises outside of the brain. For example, former President Jimmy Carter was diagnosed with metastatic
melanoma at 91 years of age and subsequently treated with immunotherapy. Strikingly, President Carter is still
alive today at 98 years old. We hypothesize that major contributing factors to the worse survival outcomes of
older adult GBM patients depend on: (i) how intratumoral gene expression levels do not change with differences
in GBM patient age [Shah et al., 2021, Cell Reports. 37(10):110100], but rather, (ii) how extratumoral levels of
immunosuppression increase in the older adult brain and potently suppress therapeutic efficacy in older adults
with GBM [Ladomersky…Wainwright, 2020, Clinical Cancer Research. 26(19):5232-5245], and (iii) how
extratumoral levels of senescence increase in the older adult brain [Kim…Wainwright, 2021, Neuro-Oncology
Advances. 3(1):vdab125]. To understand the effects of advanced age-mediated changes in the extratumoral
older adult brain, that in-turn, promotes the maladaptive response to GBM and/or GBM treatments, we will: (i)
study extratumoral IDO-mediated immunosuppression of therapeutic efficacy in older adult mice with GBM; (ii)
characterize extratumoral senescence levels and their effects on survival outcomes of older adult mice with
GBM; (iii) quantify aging parameters in the extratumoral human brain from individuals across the lifespan that
did or did not have GBM. This research is highly innovative and significant for its goal to understand aging-
dependent mechanisms that contribute to worse survival outcomes in older adults with IDHwt GBM."
10744246,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Petroleum extraction is increasingly common in urbanized areas, and yet, epidemiological research on the health
consequences for nearby urban residents is sparse. Los Angeles (LA) County, California has the largest urban
oilfield in the country and is home to thousands of active oil wells in very close proximity to homes and schools.
Few protections are in place to prevent the release of pollutants into nearby residential areas and understanding
the impacts to air quality and health among neighbors is urgently needed to inform public health protections. The
overall goal of this study is to extend a robust community-academic partnership to assess the health effects of
exposures to oil drilling wells and inform public health actions in South LA, a predominantly low-income
multiethnic community of color that faces environmental health disparities. To achieve this, the University of
Southern California and Occidental College have formed a collaboration with Redeemer Community Partnership,
a longstanding neighborhood-based organization in South LA that addresses the health and well-being of local
families. Preliminary collaborative research demonstrates episodic oil-related neighborhood air pollution events
and adverse impacts on respiratory health among residents living closer to drill sites. The proposed project, the
Los AngeleS Voices on Oil, Community, the Environment and Salud study (LAS VOCES), will examine
links between urban oil drilling, air quality and respiratory health, and enhance the capacity of the South LA
community to take action based on the identified the environmental or health impacts. The proposed
collaborative, community-driven project will 1) engaged exposed communities; 2) quantify the impact of oil drilling
on air quality using an innovative low-cost sensor network: 3) establish a diverse cohort to assess longitudinal
respiratory health of residents living near oil wells in different stages of production; and 4) develop an action-
oriented community public health plan leveraging interviews with diverse stakeholders. Our work will fill a critical
gap on impacts of urban oil drilling activities on neighborhood respiratory health and air quality through a
prospective study, as well as identify how diverse stakeholders might work together to protect public health for
vulnerable populations living nearby urban oil drilling. This project will advance community and scientific
knowledge through participatory research."

during viral surges (i.e., “bystander patients”), requires that hospitals display: (1) adaptation—the ability to
improve care and outcomes for infected patients by implementing new care processes based on accumulated
experience, and (2) resiliency—the ability to continue to deliver high quality care to uninfected patients despite
the presence of a surge event. However, it is unknown what enables hospitals to display adaptation and
resiliency, thereby threatening care quality for all patients during viral surges. I am an Instructor of Medicine in
the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of
Medicine. My preparations for this career path include masters degrees in clinical epidemiology and biomedical
ethics, mentored research training resulting in high-impact first-author publications serving as preliminary data,
national invited talks at universities and academic conferences, and clinical work as a pulmonologist and
medical intensivist at a major academic referral center. This grant application seeks to combine my and my
mentorship team’s experience in defining and studying healthcare capacity strain with purposefully selected
career development activities to achieve my complementary training and research goals including
methodologic training in advanced statistical modeling, qualitative research methods, implementation science,
and cost-effectiveness analysis. The specific aims of this grant are to: (1) Quantify adaptation by determining
how hospitals’ cumulative seasonal experiences with influenza affect processes of care and clinical outcomes
among high acuity patients with influenza. (2) Measure resiliency by determining how hospitals’ daily capacity
strain and cumulative experience during respiratory viral surges affect processes of care and clinical outcomes
among bystander patients (i.e., without infection) at risk for acute respiratory failure. (3) Identify organizational
characteristics that may influence how hospitals achieve, or struggle to achieve, adaptation and resiliency in
the face of a respiratory viral surge event. At the end of the proposed K23 award, I expect to understand how
care delivery and outcomes change over the course of a respiratory viral surge event and what organizational
factors may account for observed differences in hospital adaptation and resiliency. These findings will have
substantial positive impact by facilitating testing organizational interventions to improve hospital adaptation and
resiliency, which will be the focus of my initial R01 applications at the conclusion of the K23 award."

The goals of this Pathway to Independence Career Development proposal are to gain expertise in colorectal
cancer (CRC), population science, and experimental therapeutics, with a focus on the development of novel
therapeutic strategies for CRC, dependent on the status of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, TP53. The
training plan outlined in this proposal will take full advantage of the extensive resources and scientific
expertise at The Wistar Institute, and incorporates training with experts at Wistar, Columbia University, and
the Fox Chase Cancer Center. My training will be guided by clinical and basic cancer researchers who have
successfully mentored predoctoral, postdoctoral, and clinical fellows in academic careers.
African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates of CRC of any ethnic group in the United
States. The most common genetic alterations in CRC include K-Ras, Wnt, and TP53. We have pioneered
the analysis of naturally occurring coding region variants of p53 in different populations, with emphasis on the
impact of these variants on cancer risk and the efficacy of cancer therapy. With this proposal I take aim at
two genetic variants in p53 that exist in African American populations, and their impact on CRC progression
and therapy. The P47S variant alters p53 phosphorylation and transcriptional function; this variant is impaired
for ferroptotic cell death, and knock-in mice containing the P47S variant are susceptible to a variety of tumor
types, including CRC. The Y107H variant shows altered structure of the p53 DNA binding domain, and my
data indicate that it too has poorer tumor suppressor function and transcriptional potential. I recently used
CRISPR engineering to create a mouse model for the Y107H variant.
The P47S and Y107H variants together exist in over half a million African Americans in the United States.
The goal of the proposed research is to use these naturally-occurring variants as biologically-relevant tools
with which to dissect p53 function. I will explore the following scientific aims: 1) to elucidate the mechanisms
whereby the P47S variant promotes colorectal cancer development; and 2) to investigate the role of the
African-specific Y107H variant in tumor suppression. The completion of the scientific aims in this proposal
will develop my research skills and knowledge in both colorectal cancer and the impact of TP53 variants on
cancer risk, as well as gaining a more complete understanding of targeted therapies based upon TP53
genotype. I expect this research to have a profound impact on the understanding, and on the eventual
successful elimination, of cancer disparities in African Americans."

 Potassium channels are membrane proteins critical for the electrochemical regulation and function of cardiac cells.
Many diseases are associated with mutations in human potassium channels, including Long-QT Syndrome, Short-QT
Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, Lev-Lenegre Syndrome, and Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation. The molecular basis of
these diseases remains poorly understood, and many arrhythmia-associated mutations may directly disrupt protein folding.
Therefore, it is essential to study the mechanism and biophysical determinants of potassium channel folding to understand
how these mutations may result in arrhythmia.
 Preliminary work is presented here on the in vitro folding of the KcsA transmembrane pore domain, a robust model
system for human potassium channels such as hERG and Kv1.2. This work suggests that KcsA rapidly inserts as monomers
into a protein-dense region within the lipid membrane, and tetramerization kinetics are protein concentration-independent,
implying a unimolecular rate-limiting step despite the tetrameric nature of the channel. These observations raise the
following questions: What is the role of the protein-dense region in potassium channel folding? What are the structural
events in potassium channel folding, specifically regarding the rate-limiting step? Lastly, and most relevant to cardiac health,
how might missense mutations of the pore helix, such as A614V, L615V, and T623I of hERG, disrupt folding and lead to
arrhythmia? The proposed work will investigate the protein-dense region using super-resolution light and scanning-probe
microscopy in reconstituted membranes and live HL-1 cardiomyocytes to evaluate the hypothesis that the protein-dense
region functions to quickly concentrate channel monomers in the membrane and thus increase the speed and efficiency of
folding. To determine the structural events in channel folding, we will use a novel hydrogen-exchange mass spectrometry
(HXMS) technique alongside other biophysical methods to evaluate the hypothesis that folding must occur by one of two
possible mechanisms: (1) a “native assembly model” in which four natively-folded channel monomers assemble in a single,
concerted step, or (2) a “keystone model” in which the transmembrane helices of each monomer initially tetramerize into a
transmembrane bundle, and then the pore helix and selectivity filters insert into and stabilize the channel like the keystone
of an arch. Pulse-labeling and native state HXMS will probe the folding dynamics and stability, respectively, of channel
variants associated with Long-QT Syndrome to evaluate the hypothesis that pore helix missense mutations can cause disease
by preventing proper pore helix folding. These approaches will be complemented by computational coarse-grained and all-
atom techniques, including a novel “committor” analysis method to study the reactive flux between metastable folded and
unfolded potassium channel states.
 The proposed work is high impact: It uses innovative and interdisciplinary techniques such as HXMS to uncover
the mechanism of potassium channel folding and its implications for cardiac arrhythmia. These insights will inform future
studies of membrane protein folding biophysics as well as the pathogenesis of heart rhythm disorders."
10744735,"One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from
suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many
contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing.
Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other
illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to
only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under-
captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might
enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.
 A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records
(EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups
like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used
their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses
showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was
significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.
 The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing
phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s
BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s
EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of
suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their
Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK
Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will
further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation
to suicide attempt.
 The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics,
as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two
countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step
investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention.
Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors
would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most."

 Mutations in telomerase and telomere attrition are major risk factors for liver fibrosis and its progression
to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, due to a lack of adequate models and intrinsic difficulties in
studying human telomerase in physiologically relevant cells, the molecular mechanisms responsible for liver
fibrosis and cancer in settings of DNA damage arising from short telomeres remain elusive. While telomerase
knockout mice corroborate the importance of telomere maintenance and DNA repair for liver function, the
molecular mechanisms that govern liver abnormalities in patients with damaged telomeres are still unknown.
Likewise, the specific signaling pathways that trigger failure of hepatic cells following telomere shortening and
accumulation of DNA damage remain to be determined. In addition, mutations in the promoter region of the
telomerase reverse transcriptase component (TERT) have been described as the initial and most prevalent
mutation in HCC. While these mutations have been shown to reactivate telomerase, the functional relevance of
this process during failure and transformation of hepatic cells has yet to be interrogated.
 The focus of this proposal is to use human pluripotent stem cells as a novel platform to understand the
detrimental effects of mutant telomerase, telomere shortening and accumulation of DNA damage in different
hepatic cell lineages. We have previously generated isogenic hPSC lines harboring several disease-specific
mutations in telomerase and have successfully derived telomerase-mutant human hepatocytes and hepatic
stellate cells in vitro, following established protocols that recapitulate the in vivo development of these lineages.
 Here, two specific aims are proposed that utilize this platform to understand the molecular consequences
of telomere erosion, DNA damage, and telomerase impairment for the function of hepatic cells, and to determine
their role during early stages of transformation. In Aim 1 we will determine the role of telomere shortening and
DNA damage accumulation during fibrotic failure of different hepatic cell lineages with impaired telomerase. We
will determine the extent to which mitigation of DNA damage, reactivation of HNF4α, and modulation p53 prevent
fibrotic triggering in telomerase-mutant hepatocytes with variable telomere lengths. As liver fibrosis and its
progression to HCC are multicellular responses we will determine the role of progressive telomere shortening
during the direct and the paracrine fibrotic activation of hepatic stellate cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
molecular consequences of mutations in the TERT promoter region during progression of HCC, in settings of
exacerbated DNA damage due to eroded telomeres. Specifically, we will analyze the biochemical and functional
consequences of mutations in the TERT promoter region for hepatocyte function and immortalization.
 These studies will determine the molecular mechanisms of liver fibrosis and its progression to HCC in
settings of mutant telomerase and DNA damage. Our unique tools, combined with our expertise in telomerase,
DNA repair, and stem cell biology puts us in an ideal position to make a significant impact in this field."
10848499,"Utilizing the power of lymph nodes to generate long-lasting, systemic anti-cancer immune responses has the
potential to eradicate metastatic cancers from patients as seen with the recent success of immunotherapy in a
subset of patients. The presence of lymph node metastases, however, brings with it a worse prognosis and the
recommendation for systemic therapy for most cancer patients. Over the past 5+years our laboratory has shown
that—beyond being a biomarker of the aggressiveness of the cancer—lymph node metastases play previously
unrecognized roles in cancer progression, including by escaping the lymph node and seeding distant
metastases. Our preliminary data also show that metastatic lymph nodes are immune suppressed, which leads
to poor systemic anti-cancer immune responses and allows cancer progression. For patients with lymph node
metastasis, immune suppression of lymph nodes needs to be overcome for successful immunotherapy. For the
proposed work, we have generated strong preliminary data for two complementary mechanisms that we
hypothesize cancer cells use in metastatic lymph nodes to drive immune suppression. First, our data show that
a subset of cancer cells in metastatic lymph nodes express MHC class II molecules but not co-stimulatory
molecules. We hypothesize that interactions of MHCII positive cancer cells with naïve lymphocytes will lead to
CD4 T-cell suppression and Treg formation, limiting anti-cancer immune responses (Aim 1). We will determine
the consequences of MHCII expression on cancer cells in metastatic lymph nodes for anti-cancer immune
responses. Second, our data show limited lymphocyte infiltration into metastatic lesions in lymph nodes due to
remodeling of high-endothelial venules. Further, we show that losartan treatment can induce lymphocyte
infiltration into lymph node metastases. In the proposed work, we will determine the mechanism driving
lymphocytic infiltration after losartan treatment and test the hypothesis that these infiltrated lymphocytes can be
activated to promote anti-cancer immune responses (Aim 2). Finally, to generate an anti-cancer immune
response against metastatic lymph node lesions, both lymphocytic activation (Aim 1) and infiltration (Aim 2) are
required. Improving only one will likely not be sufficient to drive an anti-cancer immune response. Thus, we will
test translational approaches to inhibit MHCII cancer cell expression to prevent suppression of lymphocytic
immune response in combination with losartan to drive lymphocytic infiltration of metastatic lymph nodes (Aim
3). Our novel research program will discover critical mechanisms of immune suppression of metastatic lymph
nodes as well as develop therapeutic strategies to overcome these mechanisms. To achieve these goals, we
have assembled a world-class team of experts in lymph node metastasis (T. Padera), immunology (Mempel),
cancer microenvironment (Jain), systems biology (Beyaz), pathology (R. Padera), clinical translation (Taghian)
and biostatistics (Lee). The collective expertise and resources of the team will ensure successful completion of
the proposed Aims and the exploration of novel treatment approaches for patients with metastatic cancer."
10907799,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US, with pronounced
disparities in mortality by race and ethnicity. Disparities are particularly pronounced in Alaska Native and
African American people with mortality rates being 2 to 3 times higher. These disparities cannot be explained
by access to care alone, suggesting other contributing factors like molecular subtypes and cellular
heterogeneity, need to be uncovered. Tumor profiling study in patients from multiple racial and ethnic groups
will lead to novel biological insight into CRC, which greatly overcomes the limitation of previous studies that
were conducted predominantly in non-Hispanic white people only. Tumor immune contexture, which refers to
the spatial organization and density of the immune infiltrates within the tumor microenvironment, is complex
and associated with cancer prognosis. Beyond bulk analysis, cutting-edge spatial single-cell analyses enable
us to evaluate tumor immune contexture within different regions of tumor tissues (e.g. margin, center), which
will add our knowledge of immune evasion and antitumor immunity that is critical for CRC survival.
My objective is to better understand the molecular and cellular landscapes driving tumor progression in a
racial- and ethnic-sensitive manner. This will provide me with hand-on, multi-disciplinary training in the new
field of integrative tumor epidemiology. I will leverage data from a nested case-control study that includes 840
Alaska Native, African American, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White CRC patients. Each racial and ethnic group
includes 70 lethal cases who died of CRC and 140 CRC controls who survived at least as long as the case to
which they are matched for age, sex and stage. In the F99 phase, I will examine molecular signatures and
develop a prognostic index across four racial and ethnic groups using RNAseq data. I will evaluate tumor
immune contexture among Alaska Native patients using spatial-resolved single-cell technology (Akoya
PhenoCycler). In the K00 phase, I will integrate transcriptomic and single-cell data into patient-level data to
characterize tumor heterogeneity and its role in other prognostic factors (e.g. treatment, recurrence).
Results from this project will capture a full spectrum of CRC transcriptional and cellular biology and their
relationship to disease outcomes through a spatial lens and provide clinical-useful prediction tools for
prognosis that can be tailored to racially- and ethnically-diverse patients. This will help to address longstanding
racial and ethnic disparities in CRC mortality. This project provides me with training opportunities to develop
expertise in 1) molecular epidemiologic working with racial and ethnic diverse populations, especially with the
engagement of Alaska Native people, 2) cancer immunology, 3) statistical and computational analysis in high-
dimensional data. Those experiences will greatly help my transition into a post-doctoral fellow and eventually
an independent cancer researcher in the rapidly growing field of integrative tumor epidemiology."

 While KSHV can be detected in blood and occasionally in semen, it is frequently secreted in
saliva which is believed to be the main route of spread. Nearly 25 years after the identification of
KSHV, however, the initial steps in KSHV oral infection and the expressions of host and KSHV genes
are still poorly understood. Our main question is: while KSHV establishes latency in most cells and
KS lesions by default, why does it lead to spontaneous lytic replication in oral epithelial cells and oral
lesions? Our hypothesis is: this difference is due to the differences of viral epigenetics and
genomics. As the previous grant has been primarily focused on the epigenetic regulation of KSHV,
the current study will characterize the high-order genomic organization of KSHV and investigate the
transcriptomic and epigenomic regulations of KSHV at the single cell level using 3D organotypic oral
tissue infection model that closely resembles in vivo oral transmission."

The hypoxia of high-altitude (HA, >2500 m) increases the frequency of fetal growth restriction (FGR) three-fold.
The normal pregnancy rise in blood flow to the uteroplacental circulation (termed “uterine” here) is also reduced
in FGR at HA or at low altitude, but lower uterine blood flow is not solely responsible for FGR because O2 supply
still exceeds fetal O2 consumption, even at HA. Thus, the mechanisms by which lower uterine blood flow reduces
fetal growth and their temporal relationship remain unclear. Our prior work implicates AMPK in the regulation of
uterine vascular function, blood flow, and fetal growth, and our preliminary data show that FGR vs. appropriate
for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies in La Paz, Bolivia (3850 m) have lower third-trimester uterine blood flow;
greater placental AMPK activation, suppressed mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and metabolite profiles
supporting impaired fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. We propose human and sheep studies to be
conducted under chronic maternal hypoxia in order to determine
whether
placental AMPK signaling serves as a
nexus between uteroplacental perfusion and placental metabolism to regulate fetal growth through its dual role
as a potent vasodilator and metabolic sensor. In HA residents with AGA or FGR pregnancies women at
unlabored C-section, we will measure blood flows, perform four-vessel sampling on both sides of the placenta,
collect placental and human uteroplacental and fetoplacental arteries regulating blood flow for vasoreactivity
studies, and conduct biochemical assays. Because vasodilation is impaired in FGR, we will test whether
pharmacologic
mediated
 modulators of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and redox status restore impaired AMPK-
vasorelaxation.Since access to human blood vessels and placenta are only available at delivery, we
will perform parallel studies in a sheep model of hypoxia-associated FGR in order to measure these same
variables but also with metabolic tracers both before and after FGR (i.e. at mid- and late-gestation respectively)
in order to identify when uterine O2 supply decreases, and test the temporal relationship between O2 supply, O2
consumption, nutrient uptake, and fetoplacental metabolism relative to the initiation of FGR. As in the human
studies, we will also assess the effects of AMPK activation on uterine vasoreactivity and placental nutrient
metabolism, and test whether restoring mitochondrial oxidative metabolism improves vasodilation in key uterine
resistance vessels. The proposed studies will enable our understanding to move beyond the conventional idea
that insufficient fetal oxygenation triggers FGR to one in which we know when and how the hypoxia-associated
FGR develops. Such information is essential for refining therapeutic strategies for restoring fetal growth under
conditions of hypoxia, a goal that has, to date, proven elusive."

Coronary heart disease is a primary contributor to cardiovascular disease worldwide. Despite optimal treatment
many patients remain vulnerable to ischemic events. While small animal models have proven extraordinarily
effective at exploring mechanisms, studies in large animal models are critically needed, as a bridge between
rodent studies and human trials, and to develop new therapies. We have shown that insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1) reduces atherosclerotic burden and promotes features of plaque stability in Apoe-/- mice and in Rapacz
swine with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH pigs). Our novel findings indicate that IGF-1 reduces the
number of senescent cells, including senescent SMC-like and MF-like cells in pig coronary
atherosclerotic plaques, in particular in the fibrous cap (FC). Cellular senescence is thought to play a vital
role in aging and in the development of chronic disease. However, the relation between IGF-1, cell senescence
and atherosclerotic disease is virtually unknown. Senescent cells contribute to atherogenesis and fibrous cap
thinning in mouse models, but there is no information on the causal role of cell senescence in atherogenesis in
large animal models or in humans. Using scRNA-seq analysis of aortas from Apoe-/- mice and spatial
transcriptomics analysis of porcine plaque we show high-level expression of the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) factor IGF binding Protein-7 (IGFBP7), an IGF-1 inhibitor, in the fibrous cap,
primarily localized to SMC-like cells, particularly fibromyocytes. Elevated senescence scores are strongly
associated with fibromyocytes and high IGFBP7 expression. We hypothesize that senescent cells inhibit
IGF-1 signaling and that SASP-induced IGF-1 resistance reduces anti-atherosclerotic effects of IGF-1.
Our data shows that conditioned medium from senescent cultured SMC inhibits IGF1R signaling in SMC, an
effect reversed by anti-IGFBP7 antibody. Our overall goal is to demonstrate that removal of senescent cells
using a senolytic, ABT263, will reduce atherosclerosis in a large animal model and potentiate anti-atherosclerotic
effects of IGF-I. We will also demonstrate the role of IGFBP7 in IGF-1 resistance using a loss-of-function murine
model, and further explore mechanisms using in vitro studies.
Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that clearance of senescent cells using a senolytic in a large animal
model of atherosclerosis will reduce atherosclerotic burden and potentiate IGF-1 ability to reduce
atherosclerotic burden and promote plaque stability. scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, multi-marker
histology, and laser capture microdissection (LCM) will be used to dissect mechanisms.
Specific Aim 2: Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate that genetic deprivation of IGFBP7 in SMC-like cells
enhances anti-atherosclerosis effects of IGF-1. We will use SMC-selective IGFBP7-deficient mice, scRNA-
seq analysis and in vitro models to dissect mechanisms."
10756947,"ABSTRACT
Sensorineural hearing loss is highly prevalent in military Veterans, but there is currently no biological treatment
enabling full restoration of the cochlea and hearing perception. Hearing restoration by stem cell therapy holds
great promise. New advances in the generation of inner ear organoids from pluripotent stem cells and our
pioneering efforts to condition the cochlea for receiving foreign cells have paved the way forward. However,
there remain several major obstacles to combining these approaches. Foremost, there is a lack of a coherent
strategy for identifying the right donor cells and tailoring these to the severity of injury in the cochlea. In this
proposal, we are focused on stem cell therapy for the severely damaged cochlea, where extreme or chronic
injury has reduced the organ of Corti to a flat epithelium of stromal cells that have so far proven refractory to
genetic approaches to regeneration. This approach may be the only viable strategy for restoring the full
sensory epithelium in older Veterans with long-term hearing loss. Protocols for developing inner ear organoids
from pluripotent stem cells produce potential donor cells all along the otic developmental trajectory. Notably,
we have developed methods to isolate otic vesicle progenitors from non-otic cells in these cultures, but
maturation of the vesicles into sensory epithelia requires a complex, commercial extracellular matrix for
efficient differentiation in vitro. In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that multipotent otic progenitors will be
required to replace both hair cells and supporting cells in the severely damaged cochlea. The proposal tests
the impact of implanting donor cells at various stages of differentiation and examines the role of the
extracellular matrix in promoting donor cell survival and maturation. Successful completion of these studies will
open new paths toward a viable biological treatment for severe hearing loss."

 Caring for an ever aging society represents an increasing socio-economic burden and
continuing efforts are required to improve healthspan. Critically, aging is a major ‘risk
factor’ for devastating diseases including cancer, immune and cardiovascular diseases,
as well as dementias due to neurodegeneration, all of which are strongly affected by a
decline in proteostasis. Damaged or altered cytosolic proteins are cleared by the
proteasome and autophagy. Importantly, autophagy has the additional role of providing
nutrients to cells under stress conditions such as starvation, and is thus essential for
energy balance. The removal of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins is thus
essential to protect the nervous system, the liver and kidneys against age related
disorders.
Macroautophagy (MA), chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) and endosomal
microautophagy (eMI) are the three major forms of autophagy. MA engulfs bulk-regions
of cytoplasm including organelles in a double membrane vesicle (autophagosome).
Autophagosome fusion with lysosomes leads to the degradation of the engulfed material.
CMA and eMI mostly degrade proteins containing a targeting motif (KFERQ related
sequences) that is recognized by the cytoplasmic Hsc70. We have established a genetic
system to study eMI in Drosophila, overcoming a significant hurdle preventing the
characterization of the physiological role of eMI, which previously had only been
characterized biochemically and by EM in mammals. Hence, we can exploit the genetic
power of Drosophila to assess the role of this most recent variant of autophagy.
 Using our system, we will determine the physiological function and regulation of eMI. In
particular, we will identify biological processes controlled by eMI. Furthermore, we will
address how kinases we have identified as candidate regulators alter eMI, with a focus on
Drosophila models of human neurodegenerative diseases."

10769764,"Stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) are ischemic diseases that are leading causes of mortality and morbidity.
Due to the limited regenerative capacity of the brain and the heart, injury leads to irreversible loss of neurons
and cardiomyocytes, with subsequent scar formation. The process of scar formation is highlighted by excess
deposition of extracellular matrix proteins which blocks tissue repair and prevents functional recovery in the brain
and the heart. In the brain, recent evidence indicates that the traditional concepts of astrocytes forming scar may
be incorrect. In the heart, there may be a key role for other mesenchymal cells in scar formation in addition to
cardiac fibroblasts.
Pericytes are a heterogeneous population of mural cells located on the abluminal surface of the
microvasculature, where they communicate with endothelial cells by means of physical contact and paracrine
signaling. Recent studies and work from our laboratories have suggested that pericytes may contribute to fibrosis
after an ischemic injury by migration to the site of injury, where they contribute to collagen deposition. We have
demonstrated expression of common genes in pericytes in both organ systems with similar migratory patterns
to site of injury, suggestive of parallel pathways that regulate pericyte activation in the brain and the heart. This
data suggests that pericytes are a scar-forming cell population that may be a target for modulating the balance
between tissue fibrosis and repair. However, detailed study of pericytes has been hampered by lack of markers
that hinder their isolation and the ability for targeting of key molecular pathways that may drive scar formation.
Furthermore, it is not entirely clear whether the heterogeneous pericyte populations possess distinct functional
roles, such that a subpopulation is responsive to and participates in fibrosis after injury. This grant brings together
neuroscience and cardiovascular expertise to develop a novel platform for studying how pericytes may actively
contribute to the fibrotic scar in the two most common and devastating adult ischemic diseases.
We hypothesize that pericytes contain distinct subpopulations that preferentially localize to the site of ischemic
injury and directly participate in scar formation. In specific aim 1, we will use novel lineage-tracing techniques
to investigate proliferation and migration of pericytes to the site of injury and examine their participation in scar
formation. In specific aim 2, we will perform single-cell gene expression profiling of brain and heart pericytes
before and after injury to map the transcriptional changes of pericytes as they become pro-fibrotic. In specific
aim 3, we will determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate pericyte activation by performing gain and loss
of function using in vitro and in vivo models. Supported by our preliminary data, the proposed project addresses
an important issue of how pericytes participate in the development and progression of scar after stroke and MI.
This in turn may identify mechanisms responsible for pericyte activation and proliferation as targets for anti-
fibrotic therapies."

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19. In
severe cases, COVID-19 leads to profound inflammation (“cytokine storm”) followed by coagulopathy and a
prothrombotic-state with progression to multiple organ failure. Several cytokines, including IL6 are elevated.
Further, a proinflammatory galectin, Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is also found elevated. Gal-3 upregulates IL6 and other
cytokines, can directly activate platelets, neutrophils, and endothelial cells, and is known to mediate venous
thrombosis via IL6 in a mouse model. A growing body of literature has implicated neutrophil, platelet and
endothelial cell activation as potential drivers of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients. However,
there are no direct mechanistic links established between inflammation, vascular cell activation, and
thrombosis during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective is to define the mediators that cause activation of
neutrophils, platelets and/or endothelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their mechanistic roles in
promoting thrombin generation and thrombosis. At the University of Iowa, we led a multicenter randomized
clinical trial (RCT) comparing standard prophylactic dose to intermediate dose enoxaparin in hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 (NCT04360824) and collected plasma samples for biomarkers and mechanistic
studies. Given the upsurge in late thrombotic complications of COVID-19, we now propose to recruit additional
patients to collect serial samples every week during hospitalization and thereafter every 3 months for up to 3
years. We hypothesize that thrombogenicity in COVID-19 is mediated by IL6- and Gal-3-driven activation of
hematopoietic and endothelial cells and that the prothrombotic state persists even after recovery from viral
infection. Our team has a unique combination of expertise and resources that will address the hypothesis in 2
well integrated but independent aims. In Aim 1, using serially collected patient’s samples, we will determine
the mechanistic role of IL6, Gal-3, and NETs in mediating cellular activation and enhancing thrombin
generation and thrombosis in COVID-19. Aim 2 will utilize a novel transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2
infection to determine if targeting IL6, Gal-3, or NETs in vivo protects against cellular activation, thrombin
generation and thrombosis. A strength of this proposal is in utilizing clinical samples and a novel preclinical
model to identify critical mechanistic pathways for cellular activation, thrombin generation and in vivo
thrombosis in COVID-19. Thus, the overall impact of the proposed research agenda is very high and is likely to
provide therapeutic targets for decreasing thrombotic burden in COVID-19."
10769813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality within the US, responsible for 1 in 4 deaths. Immunotherapies have
ushered in a new age of cancer treatment, leveraging the potency of the immune system to restrict cancer without
many of the side effects of conventional therapies. These immunotherapies have primarily targeted immune
responses specific for tumor antigens (tAg). Although tAg-specific T cell immunotherapies have proven powerful
tools in combatting cancer, their success is context-dependent, displaying limited efficacy in most solid tumors.
This is largely owed to chronic T cell receptor (TCR) binding to cognate tAg, leading to permanent cellular
dysfunction. Solid tumors comprise the majority of cancer cases and deaths, thus, it is essential to exploit other
cellular modalities in immunotherapies. Recently, it has become apparent that tAg-nonspecific “bystander” T
cells are observed and often outnumber tAg-specific T cells in solid tumors. Although their function within tumors
is unknown, bystander T cells can exert cytotoxic effector function once activated by inflammation in a number
of contexts. My unique approach leveraging T cells with defined T cell receptors (TCRs) allows me to determine
the mechanisms that dictate bystander T cell entry into the tumor and if they maintain the ability to respond to
stimulation once tumor-resident. To appreciate the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironments, I will employ
multiple animal models of solid tumors. My objectives are two-fold: First, I want to test how bystander T cells
migrate to the tumor and if they are spared from dysregulation due to their inability to recognize tAg. Second, I
want to test if the dichotomous effects of bystander T cells can be therapeutically leveraged to improve anti-
tumor responses. At homeostasis, bystander T cells can simply deny other immune cells access to targets,
hindering antigen (Ag)-specific immune responses. Once activated by inflammation, bystander T cells rapidly
acquire effector function and directly kill target cells in an innate-like manner. To achieve these objectives, I will
employ my expertise in 28-color flow cytometry to interrogate cell phenotype, activation, and functional capacity.
I will complement my use of flow cytometry with 3-dimensional immunofluorescence, which will uncover sub-
anatomic immune cell organization within the tumor. Hypothesis: My central hypothesis is that bystander T cells
in solid tumors remain functional and can be therapeutically leveraged in cancer specifically. I will test this
hypothesis through two independent aims: AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that bystander T cells are recruited into
tumors by CXCR3 and remain functional in the tumor microenvironment. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that anti-
tumor immune responses can be enhanced by activated bystander T cells or targeted depletion of tissue-resident
bystanders. My proposed experiments will elucidate the role of bystander T cells in tumor both with and without
interventions, with the goal of developing interventions to improve cancer outcomes, which is in alignment with
the mission of the NCI and NIH."
10769814,"Exposure of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is known to induce lung cancer. Although there is emerging interest
in mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis, role of Cr(VI) in inducing RNA modification in carcinogenesis
is unknown. Our preliminary studies found that higher levels of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) were found
in lung tissues from Cr(VI)-exposed mice, samples from Cr(VI)-exposed nonsmoking workers, and Cr(VI)-
transformed (Cr-T) cells. To study underlying mechanism, we found that METTL3 was induced by upregulation
of Nrf2 and SOX4, two important transcription factors. We found that METTL3 was important in regulating Cr-T
cell proliferation, tube formation and tumor angiogenesis. METTL3 induced hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-
1) expression through suppressing PHD2, suggesting METTL3/PHD2/HIF-1 signaling would be important in
Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) and IL-8 were downstream effectors of METTL3.
Our whole genome expression array analysis of blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Cr(VI)-exposed
nonsmoking workers and control subjects showed that METTL3, CXCL5 and IL-8 were among the most
upregulated molecules in Cr(VI) exposure group, which was validated using RT-qPCR and ELISA assays. We
hypothesize that long-term Cr(VI) exposure induces METTLE3 overexpression to regulate cell
transformation, tumor growth and angiogenesis through METTL3/PHD2/HIF-1 axis in lung epithelial
cells, and SOX4 and NRF-2 are two key upstream inducers. In order to test this hypothesis, we will perform
three specific aims: Aim 1) To determine role and mechanism of METTL3 upregulation in Cr(VI)-induced cell
transformation, tumor growth and angiogenesis, and to identify upstream regulator(s) of METTL3 elevation in
Cr-T cells. Aim 2) To investigate key downstream targets and molecules of METTL3 in Cr(VI)-induced cell
transformation and tumor growth. Aim 3) To determine whether METTL3 upregulation in Cr-T cells induces
tumor angiogenesis through CXCR1/2 receptors and paracrine effect using humanized chimeric tumor model;
to determine expression levels of Nrf2, SOX4, METTL3, PHD2, HIF-1, CXCL5, and/or IL-8 in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lung tissues from the Cr(VI)-exposed mice and in
PBMCs from workers with occupational exposure to Cr(VI). We will use a combination of molecular
approaches, animal models, and blood and tissue samples from human subjects and mice to define the role
and mechanisms of new METTL3/PDH2/HIF-1 axis induced by Nrf2 and SOX4 in mediating cell
transformation, tumor growth and angiogenesis, and determine the possible correlations with Cr(VI) internal
exposure doses in workers and in mice via levels of these molecules. We will also investigate the effects of
downstream effectors of METTL3/PDH2/HIF-1 axis, and their receptors in Cr-T cell-inducing angiogenesis.
These studies will help us understand underlying mechanisms of Cr(VI) in inducing tumor growth and
angiogenesis, and identify new biomarkers for early detection of Cr(VI) exposure and cancer prevention."

While hormonal contraceptive methods are highly effective, they are not the method of choice for many women.
The National Health Statistic Report indicates that on-demand over-the-counter (OTC) contraceptives (i.e.,
spermicides and condoms) are the products of choice for many women, especially teenagers. Unfortunately,
OTC methods have high failure rates. As a result, teenage pregnancies contribute to more than 70% of
unintended pregnancy rates in the United States. Therefore, there is a critical need for new and improved on-
demand methods for women. In this proposal, we will explore a new female contraceptive method that will target
two processes: 1) blocking post-ejaculated semen and 2) inhibiting sperm motility in the female reproductive
tract. After ejaculation, semen changes from a gel-like to a watery consistency via the prostate-derived serine
protease called kallikrein 3 (KLK3). Therefore, the central hypothesis for this application is that pharmacologic
blockade of semen liquefaction provides a contraceptive effect by blocking sperm from reaching the site
of fertilization. Our previous work showed that a serine protease inhibitor effectively blocked those two
processes and prevented pregnancy in female mice. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that small
molecule KLK3 inhibitors with targeted activity can be developed for use as novel, non-hormonal, fully
reversible contraceptives for women. In this application, a team of investigators will test the action of small
molecule KLK3 inhibitor(s) in human semen and sperm function, pregnancy prevention in female rhesus
macaques, and will identify novel small molecules inhibitors of KLK3 in addition to the prototype inhibitor. The
hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1) to characterize the contraceptive potential of specific KLK3
inhibitors in human semen, 2) To evaluate the cellular toxicity of specific KLK3 inhibitor and “hit” compound(s) in
human cervical/vaginal cells and 3D vaginal cultures, 3) to characterize the contraceptive efficacy and
pharmacodynamics/kinetics of specific KLK3 inhibitor in female rhesus macaques, and 4) To identify novel drug-
like KLK3-specific inhibitors from DNA-encoded chemical libraries. Upon completion of this study, we will be able
to demonstrate whether serine protease inhibitor can be developed as the first contraceptive product (i.e.,
film/sponge) that prevents semen liquefaction as well as inhibits the sperm function."

10769724,"Abstract
Sex differences in drug-related behaviors have been well documented and attributed primarily to differences
in levels of estrogens in adult men versus women. This program advances the field beyond this hypothesis
to examine another important factor, sex chromosome complement, with a focus on X-chromosome genes
that escape X-inactivation which are expressed in greater levels in female versus male brains. The four core
genotype (FCG) mouse model allows separate analysis of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome
complement (XX vs. XY). In Aim 1 these mice will be used to examine combined and separate actions of
estradiol and sex chromosome complement on vulnerability to cocaine addiction using intravenous self-
administration. Rates of acquisition and levels of motivation to obtain the drug will be evaluated. In Aim 2, we
will define the role of two X-chromosome genes that escape inactivation in mouse and human brain, Utx and
Smcx. These genes code for enzymes that demethylate histone modifications, regulating chromatin
accessibility and transcription on a wide basis. This work will be conducted with two lines of inducible, tissue-
specific knockout mice that lack the expression of either gene (Utx or Smcx) in CaMK2α in forebrain, including
neurons in the nucleus accumbens. The mice will be tested as in Aim 1 for cocaine vulnerability and
motivation. In Aim 3 brain tissue from the nucleus accumbens of mice tested in Aims 1 and 2 will be used for
epigenetic analysis. A combination of ATAC (Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin-), Pro (Precision
Nuclear Run-On-) and ChIP (Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation-) Sequencing will be used to identify
transcriptionally active and repressed genes associated with chromatin restructuring and important
transcription factors. The long term objective of this work is to reveal new mechanisms that underlie sex
differences in vulnerability to addiction that help clinicians design sex-specific preventions/interventions."
10769727,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
My career goals are to 1) understand the supraspinal sensorimotor pathways through which age- and age-
related conditions diminish the functionality of the locomotor control system, and 2) use this information to
develop new therapies to improve gait and balance in older adults. I hope to achieve this goal by transitioning
into an independent scientist and leading an research program in the fields of aging and balance control.
 In older adults, diminished lower-extremity somatosensation is highly prevalent and a primary contributor
to poor balance, reduced mobility, and increased risk of falling. The vast majority of research and clinical efforts
to date have attempted to improve somatosensation by restoring the function of peripheral elements of the
somatosensory system. However, somatosensation is also dependent upon the capacity to activate the
appropriate cortical networks in response to a given stimulus, which is also altered in older adults. Therapeutic
strategies aimed at enhancing the excitability of the somatosensory cortical network thus offer untapped
potential to improve foot-sole somatosensation in this population. Our preliminary studies suggest that a single
session of traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which produces a diffuse electric field over
the primary somatosensory cortex, improves foot-sole somatosensation in older adults. In this K01 Award, we
will first work to identify the specific cortical network that is responsive to walking-related foot-sole stimulation
in older adults with and without foot-sole somatosensation (Aim 1). We will use a block-design functional MRI
paradigm with a custom-designed, MRI-compatible foot sole stimulation system to apply individualized
pressures to the participant’s foot soles that mimic those experienced when they walk, yet while they lay
motionless in the scanner. Based upon this knowledge obtained from Aim 1, we will develop a novel multi-
target tDCS intervention targeting the identified cortical network and test the effects of a single session of this
intervention on foot-sole somatosensation, balance and mobility in older adults with mild-to-moderate foot-sole
somatosensory impairments (Aim 2). We will then use participant brain MRIs and electric field modeling to
establish the “dose-response” relationship between on-target current intensity induced by tDCS and its acute
effect on the cortical response to foot sole stimulation (Aim 3). Through this work we will learn about how
chronic lower-extremity somatosensory impairments influence the cortical processing of sensory feedback
involved in the control of balance and mobility, demonstrate that such processing can be modulated by tDCS,
and thus, obtain critical information needed to design a larger more definitive trial to test the potential for tDCS
to improve foot sole sensation, balance, and mobility in this population. This career development award will
provide me with unique training experiences in neurophysiology of somatosensation in aging, the clinical care
of these older adults, and increase my expertise in advanced neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques,
which, taken together, will greatly facilitate my efforts to transition into an independent academic scientist."
10769760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Motile cilia are essential for lung defense, as evidenced by the genetic syndrome primary ciliary dyskinesia
(PCD). PCD is characterized by impaired motile cilia resulting in respiratory distress at birth, followed by chronic
sinopulmonary infection and bronchiectasis, which can lead to respiratory failure. There are no specific therapies
for PCD, in part because key pathways for motile cilia biogenesis and pathogenesis are not defined. PCD has
been linked to mutations in nearly 40 genes. Those that encode dynein proteins, the motors necessary for cilia
beating, comprise the largest class of PCD mutations. We have found that mutations in dynein motor proteins
result in abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates in ciliated cells. Importantly, these aggregates sequester normal
proteins of the machinery required to assemble the dynein motor complexes, suggesting a global disruption of
cilia assembly. To further determine the impact of mutations, we biopsied and cultured airway cells from patients
with PCD, revealing increased expression of genes related to cell stress, including IL-1 and IL6. We hypothesize
that accumulation of mutant protein leads to failure of the cilia assembly machinery and to cellular stress. This
will be tested through the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine how mutant dynein proteins interrupt the
cilia motor assembly pathway and (2) Define the transcriptional and stress responses in cells containing
PCD mutant proteins. We will leverage primary culture nasal cells from patients with mutations in dynein motor
proteins seen at our PCD clinic. To determine how mutant proteins perturb cilia assembly, we will use proteomics
and advanced microscopy to quantify the interaction of the mutant dynein proteins with the assembly machinery.
To characterize the effect of mutant protein on cell stress, we will employ RNA sequencing to define the
transcriptional profile of PCD cells and test known cell stress pathways. Data generated from this proposal will
identify shared pathways in PCD, that can be exploited to develop future therapeutic strategies.
This proposal comprises a plan to provide Dr. Horani with the mentored research, technical skill development,
and tailored didactic training needed to achieve his goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. The
training will cover areas of genetics and genomics, sequencing data analysis, and advanced fluorescent
microscopy imaging, which are key areas of this proposal. This project will be overseen by a scientific advisory
committee with expertise in motile cilia biology, protein interactions, proteostatic pathways and imaging. The
committee will ensure that career milestones are realized, formal course work is completed, and collaborations
are developed locally and internationally. Findings generated through the proposed studies can be applied to
other genetic airway disease and training will allow Dr. Horani to develop new approaches and therapies that
may improve patients’ health as an independent investigator."
10769761,"Abstract: Diabetes increases the risk and frequency of bacterial infection and alters the adaptive immune
response. Surprisingly little is known about the impact of diabetes on dendritic cells and how it may increase
susceptibility to periodontitis. The lack of understanding until recently has been hampered by limited technical
ability to define the specific behavior of dendritic cells and interactions with other cell types during active
periodontal disease. New advances in single cell transcriptomics such as single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have
provided an exponential increase in our ability to dissect the behavior of specific cell types under various disease
conditions. The studies proposed will elucidate how diabetes alters dendritic cell function in a way that
contributes to periodontitis. New Prel Data has been added resulting a completely revised proposal
demonstrating that diabetes alters dendritic cell gene expression in vivo as assessed by scRNA-seq. The studies
proposed involve sophisticated bioinformatic analysis of scRNA-seq data very recently obtained and a new
experimental approach, spatially resolved transcriptomics, to provide new insight on how diabetes may affect
dendritic cell activity. The risk in this approach in Aim 1 is mitigated by Prel Data that have identified potential
key genes that are up- or down-regulated in the periodontium in dendritic cells during active periodontal disease
progression, which will be further investigated by bioinformatic analysis of scRNA-seq results. In addition,
translational studies are proposed in Aim 1 as a preclinical step for therapeutic intervention. Functional studies
are proposed in Aim 2 to examine gene candidates in vitro to establish cause and effect relationships between
candidate genes and functional outcomes. Experiments in Aim 3 will use spatial transcriptomics to define how
diabetes may alter the spatial compartments in which DC and other leukocytes are found during the initiation of
periodontitis and investigate co-localization of cells and pattern of inflammatory gene expression to better
understand their interaction. Taken together this proposal combines an unbiased approach for hypothesis
discovery with functional in vitro and in vivo methods for hypothesis testing and establishing mechanisms."

Project Summary
Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few
items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to
many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance
grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security
numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental
building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction
involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely
compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary
step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states.
A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a
laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify
spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to
interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site
recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic
information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory
representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading
some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped
by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote
the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC-
striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task.
We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode
representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions
change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of
striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine
how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on
a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to
disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a
biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a T cell–mediated, hair-specific disorder with a 2.1% lifetime risk, that recently has been

totalis (AT) or even whole-body hair loss [alopecia universalis (AU)]. A large unmet need exists for efficacious
and safer therapeutics for extensive AA patients (≥50% scalp loss), such as targeted therapeutic strategies that
are now in use for other immune-mediated skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). This is particularly
important in children, where treatments suitable for long-term use are not available. In a well-characterized
clinical trial with 60 adult AA patients, we have recently showed that dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that
inhibits IL-4/IL-13 signaling by blocking the IL-4Rα subunit, induced significant hair regrowth, and significantly
modulated the molecular AA phenotype in scalp tissues, particularly in patients with high IgE and/or atopic
comorbidities, opening the door for targeted treatments for younger subjects with extensive AA. These data
established a solid rationale for the potential of dupilumab to induce hair regrowth in pediatric AA patients with
an atopic background. We hypothesize that the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are “drivers” in AA and their
inhibition with dupilumab in pediatric AA subjects with an atopic background and/or high levels of IgE
will shed light on the role of Type 2 inflammation in AA and the immune and regulatory pathways
underlying suppression and/or induction of hair-associated keratins. We will test our hypothesis in a
double-blinded clinical trial in 76 children (6-17 years old) with extensive AA (>/=50% scalp), randomized 2:1 to
dupilumab or placebo, respectively, for 48 weeks, followed by another 48 weeks of open label dupilumab, and
16 weeks of follow-up (for a total of 112 weeks). We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims
(Aim 1 is related to clinical effects, while Aims 2 and 3 are translational aims): 1. To assess the safety,
tolerability clinical efficacy, and durability of response with subcutaneous administration of dupilumab
in pediatric subjects with severe (?50% scalp) AA and high IgE and/or atopic background; 2. To evaluate
the ability of specific Th2 antagonism with dupilumab to modulate Th2 and other immune and regulatory
pathways, as well as hair keratins, and stem cell biomarkers in scalp of children and adolescents with
extensive AA; and 3. To characterize the ability of dupilumab to modulate inflammatory, regulatory, and
tolerogenic immune pathways in blood of pediatric AA patients during and after treatment. By closely
coupling biomarkers with clinical response, this trial will permit the maximal translational advantage. This study
will expand our mechanistic understanding of AA in children and if successful, it may change the treatment
paradigm for pediatric AA, enabling the use and further development of targeted therapeutics."

Thrive Digital Health (“TDH”) is developing a novel Peer Recovery Support Services (“PRSS”)
training platform (the “TDPP”) to standardize and scale the training of Peer Recovery Supporters.
TDH was founded by the principals of two successful existing companies at the forefront of
advancing PRSS, and benefits from the expertise of its CEO, who in addition to serving on the
board of the Peer Recovery Center of Excellence, is a nationally recognized thought leader on
PRSS training and implementation. The overarching goal of this Fasttrack project is to develop
and test an evidence-based platform that will extend standards-based and empirically-supported
Peer Recovery Support Services training and implementation across the country. Success in this
endeavor will expand access to support services for recovery from alcohol and other substance
use disorders, and help to address critical care gaps stemming from the treatment provider
shortage currently impacting the nation. We hypothesize that this scalable platform, used by
PRSS Trainers and Trainees, will be acceptable, feasible and usable, and will deliver a positive
effect in terms of knowledge gain, adherence and skill in Phase I. In Phase II of this Fasttrack
effort, we hypothesize that this platform will deliver superior training results among PRSS
trainees in terms of adherence and skill versus training-as-usual. Our priority commercial goal is
to bring this solution to market with organizations around the country seeking to build PRSS
capacity, and we will accomplish this through the following Phase II specific aims: (1) Assess the
effect on PRSS providers of the fully asynchronous TDPP and the TDPP with live zoom sessions
on skill and adherence compared with training-as-usual; (2) Assess the effect of adding three live,
interactive group teleconferencing sessions to the TDPP asynchronous content; (3) Conduct a
pre-post study with a pilot population of PRSS provider trainees from another state to assess
fidelity of implementation when content is localized for another state. The expected impact of
this project is to substantially enhance TDH’s ability to deliver effective PRSS training at scale,
expanding access to recovery support services across the country. This capability holds promise
to reduce negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total
cost of providing treatment services."

Project Summary/Abstract
This program focuses on technically challenging questions related to lipoxygenases, their associated enzymes
and proteins, and an unprecedented higher-resolution analysis of mechanisms of biosynthesis and fate of the
oxidation products. These pathways are conserved widely in evolution and ubiquitous in higher animals. A major
thrust is uncovering the mechanistic basis of how a 12R-lipoxygenase (12R-LOX) metabolic pathway functions
to secure formation of the water permeability barrier in the epidermis. Pathway genetic deficiencies have
devastating consequences, being neonatal lethal in mice and in humans causing congenital ichthyosis (scaly
skin), an extremely socially challenging condition. We identified 12R-LOX, epidermal-LOX-3, and the
dehydrogenase SDR9C7, as working in series to oxidize linoleic acid (18:2w6) that is esterified in a skin-specific
acylceramide. Such oxidations are essential for covalent binding of ceramides to barrier protein, forming sub-
structures visible by EM: the corneocyte lipid envelopes. We will apply a singular combination of technical
resources (recombinant enzymes and barrier proteins, novel LOX products, unique collection of oxidize
acylceramides, access to mouse knockout epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays, proteomics) to uncover how
12R-LOX oxidations lead to sealing the permeability barrier. Our hypothesis rides on the nature of the linoleate-
ester oxidation, which forms an epoxy-enone-linoleate, reactive with nucleophiles and capable of adducting to
protein. Understanding these mechanisms will have long-term impact on treatment of skin barrier-related
diseases as well as optimizing artificial skin production for treating burns and severe diabetic ulcers. In a second
arm of the program, we address technical questions in the field of lipoxygenase product biosynthesis. First,
defining the biochemical mechanisms of forming the oxygenated derivatives of “fish oil” fatty acid EPA and DHA,
products currently cited as pro-resolving in inflammation, the biosynthesis remaining controversial over the past
20 years. Second, the mechanisms in cyclization of fatty acid allene oxides (highly unstable epoxides) to
cyclopentenones. The latter is relevant to heme-protein chemistry and to synthetic chemistry of cyclopentenones
and other 5-membered carbocycles. Summing up the vision and suitability for the freedom afforded by MIRA
funding: we address mechanistically important and challenging projects, apply unparalleled technical abilities
including analysis of extremely unstable pathway intermediates, and leadership in exemplifying the highest
standards in the fields of lipoxygenases and related lipid oxygenases."

Child care centers ─ and their providers ─ are critical partners in public health efforts to address today’s obesity
epidemic. Diet and physical activity (PA) habits are formed early, influencing immediate and long-term obesity
risk, and both centers and providers play key roles in forming children’s weight-related habits. Yet, the standard
paradigm of child care-based obesity prevention initiatives primarily target only center directors to change
organizational-level policies and practices; failing to recognize the needs of the child care providers. These
providers suffer disproportionally high prevalence of obesity and research has shown that providers’ own poor
eating and PA behaviors reduce their confidence and ability to model and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors to
the children in their care. However, information regarding the effectiveness of improving provider health
behaviors or whether such improvements elicit meaningful change in the child care environment and the children
in their care is limited. Leveraging our team’s expertise with implementing evidence-based behavior change and
weight loss interventions, the proposed study will integrate an evidence-based weight management intervention
for child care providers into Go NAPSACC’s existing childhood obesity prevention program (Go NAPSACC+).
Go NAPSACC+ program will be assessed using a clustered randomized controlled trial to evaluate if improving
child care providers’ health behaviors elicit meaningful change in dietary and PA behaviors in 2-5-year-old
children in their care and the child care environment. We will recruit 84 centers, including 168 providers, and 672
2–5-year-old children to participate in the evaluation. Centers will be randomly assigned to 1) standard “Go
NAPSACC” or 2) “Go NAPSACC+” (with a provider weight management component). Outcome measures will
assess impact on dietary intake and PA behaviors of 2-5-year-old children at 6 months (primary aim) and 12
months. Secondarily we will compare the impact of the intervention on centers’ implementation of healthy weight
practices and the effect on provider-level weight, diet quality and/or PA at 6 and 12-months. Extensive process
analysis, guided by the RE-AIM framework, will document the fidelity of the interventions, challenges and barriers
to effective implementation, and use of program specified activities. If successful, findings will provide a highly
implementable, scalable, and sustainable strategy that would enhance the standard paradigm of early childhood
obesity prevention initiatives."
10766678,"Adverse inflammatory response leads to cell death and organ dysfunction. We will investigate whether acute intravenous (IV) treatments of lipid emulsions containing medium-chain triglycerides (TG) (MCT) and omega-3 (n-3) TG enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) provide a new therapeutic approach to ameliorate adverse inflammatory responses by targeting rapid cellular n-3 FA membrane enrichment. n-3 fatty acids (FA) are increasingly recognized as a potent supplement in IV feeding because of their pro-healing and anti-inflammatory effects against apoptosis and production of free radicals and pro- inflammatory eicosanoids. Studies in experimental animal models demonstrate that bolus injections of n-3 TG- rich emulsion particles (TGRP) are therapeutically protective in decreasing brain death and morbidity after stroke. We have discovered that TGRP containing both MCT and fish oil TG (8:2 wt/wt) enriched cell membranes of white blood cells and endothelial cells with n-3 FA more efficiently than other TGRP. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we reported that the inclusion of MCT into model TGRP promotes model membrane lipid disorder that may accelerate n-3 delivery rates, highlighting the advantage of bolus injection for n-3 FA enrichment. However, very few studies have addressed the acute anti-inflammatory effects of acute IV n-3 administration. Currently, there is no data on optimal mixtures of MCT with n-3 TG to achieve the most rapid and highest-magnitude anti-inflammatory action. Our central hypothesis is that bolus injections of TGRPs containing both MCT and n-3 TG will cooperatively affect membrane dynamics to accelerate n-3 FA incorporation into cell membranes, which will initiate n-3-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions. These will be studied under 3 Specific Aims. Under Aim 1, we will characterize biophysical properties of MCT-containing TGRP with different n-3 TG contents using biophysical approaches coupled with mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to assess alteration in membrane structure and activity mediated by specific MCT:n-3 TGRP containing DHA, EPA, or both. In Aim 2, we will define cellular uptake pathways responsible for internalization and metabolic utilization of specific MCT:n-3 TGRP characterized in Aim 1 in cultured immune-effector macrophages and in mouse models. We will then investigate under Aim 3 how MCT:n-3 TGRP cellular internalization affects functional activities of monocytes and macrophages in response to an acute immune stimulus (LPS) in mouse models. The proposed studies in cells and animal models will establish innovative methods that are adaptable for targeted, rapid delivery of lipophilic and hydrophobic therapeutic agents to specific organs or tissues. We will uncover novel synergies between MCT and n-3 TG that modulate membrane lipid composition, cell lipid metabolism, and immune responses. Our studies will be of high significance to many fields, including immune responses to infection and inflammation-related tissue injury and organ dysfunction."

Abstract 
The University at Buffalo (UB) continues to work towards increasing the number of PhD students from underserved groups in biomedical and behavioral sciences. The IMSD at UB plays an essential role in attracting and supporting students through collaborative learning and integrated mentoring. Since 2012, a total of 39 students from various backgrounds enrolled and participated in IMSD professional development activities. To date, 11 graduated and 21 are in training, with a mean time to graduation of 5.3 years (median: 4.8 years). The graduation rate moved from 73% during the initial funding period to an estimated 94% in the current funding period. The IMSD at UB is building upon this success, together with faculty from 18 departments spanning seven UB Schools and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, to continue the transformation of UB into a leading institution for training a talented workforce. Specific aims are: 1) Attract five PhD students from underserved groups in biomedical and behavioral sciences at UB per year increasing enrollment by a total of 25 during the 5-year funding period, by using targeted recruiting and holistic review. 2) Provide mentoring, professional development and grant writing training to achieve academic success, secure funding and ensure successful completion of PhD degrees. The program will guide students through their PhD training using Individualized Development Plans to tailor research activities, professional development, mentoring and faculty support. 3) Facilitate access to careers in science and leadership positions to foster successful transition into competitive postdoctoral positions and jobs in academia, industry, government, or other organizations. To foster growth of professional networks, the program developed the Career Pathways Seminar to allow IMSD students to meet and establish relationships with leaders in these institutions where they will potentially complete a research internship to explore future career paths. 4) Create a safe and inclusive research learning environment adaptive to students’ academic and professional needs. This aim will focus on increasing faculty recruitment and retention efforts, throughout established partnerships with the UB Provost Office, School’s leaders, and senior administrators. The program will expand activities dedicated to holistic review of applications by graduate program directors, admissions committees, administrators, and faculty search committees, and to develop committee members interview skills to recruit and retain a student-focused, talented faculty population at UB. The success of the IMSD at UB will be realized by a) increasing the applicant pools for graduate students and faculty, b) students’ scientific productivity and entry into the workforce, c) improved student and faculty mentoring and support, and d) building a stronger learning environment at UB."
10766769,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pathological aggression is a recurrent pattern of disruptive and violent behavior, which typically emerges in
adolescence and peaks in young adulthood. Despite the significant socioeconomic burden imposed by the
repercussions of pathological aggression, available treatments are limited and inadequate. A key problem in
treating pathological aggression lies in its complex structure, which reflects the overlap of distinct constructs and
age-specific mechanisms; thus, identifying the neurodevelopmental bases of the commonalities and differences
between these constructs is critical to developing better therapies.
To study these neurobiological mechanisms, we focused on the best-characterized gene × environment (G×E)
interaction in pathological aggression, occurring between low-activity alleles of the MAOA gene (encoding the
enzyme monoamine oxidase A) and child maltreatment. During our previous funding period, we developed the
first animal model of this G×E interaction, by subjecting a line of mice with a MAOA hypomorphic mutation to
early-life stress during the first week of life. Unlike their unstressed and wild type (WT) controls, these mice
develop aggression following a two-stage process: the first stage occurs in early life, before the onset of
aggression, and reflects progressive functional deficits of the prefrontal cortex and its downstream connectivity;
conversely, the second stage occurs around puberty, after the onset of aggression, and is characterized by an
age-dependent escalation of fighting behavior.
Our preliminary data show that each hit is sustained by a specific mechanism. The first hit involves the activation
of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, while the second is based on an upsurge of testosterone and its metabolites. We
also showed that the attacking behavior in our model reflects the hyperactivation of dopaminergic
neurotransmission in response to social challenges. Based on these findings, the studies proposed in this
application will test the hypothesis that the development of PA is shaped by age-specific mechanisms
converging on mesolimbic dopaminergic alterations.
The studies in Aims 1 and 2 will determine how dopaminergic neurotransmission and different aggression
constructs are influenced by 5-HT2A receptor stimulation during the first stage and steroids during the second
stage. The studies in Aim 3 will explore whether the dopaminergic activation during attacks may lead to
behavioral reinforcement, ultimately promoting “aggression addiction”. Taken together, this research will help
elucidate the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of pathological aggression, and identify new potential targets for
the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition."

The long-term objective of the Endowment for Cardiometabolic Health Disparities Research is to expand the
capacity of Meharry Medical College (MMC) to enhance research and research training in minority health. The
program will address health disparities in cardiometabolic health disproportionately prevalent in the African
Americans in Nashville and Davidson County, the catchment areas of MMC. We will accomplish this objective
by recruiting a well-established anchor faculty to build intellectual capacity, increasing the number of PhD
students from underrepresented backgrounds in health disparity research, providing interdisciplinary research
and leadership training to postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty from underrepresented backgrounds, and
increasing the number of health professional faculty involved in cardiovascular health disparity research. To
achieve our goal, there are 5 priority activities. Priority Activity 1 is to develop a bachelors to masters to PhD
pathway program in partnership with nearby undergraduate HBCU institutions. We will develop graduate
curriculum and establish a new PhD training graduate concentration in cardiometabolic health disparities
research. Priority Activity 2 is to hire a Senior Magnet Cardiovascular Scientist and Junior Scientist to build a
corpus of researchers. Priority Activity 3 is to develop a research leadership program for postdoctoral fellows to
early-stage tenure-track faculty underrepresented in medicine and science to allow them to successfully
establish their independent research programs and transition to successful tenure status. Priority Activity 4 is to
establish an annual Presidents Seminar to bring accomplished, nationally recognized prominent researchers on
the Meharry campus to present and to engage with our PhD candidates and faculty for new networking/mentoring
opportunities. Priority Activity 5 is to invest in research infrastructure to advance technological innovation on our
campus for experimentation, data collection, and translational research focused on health disparities of
cardiometabolic disease. With endowment funds secured through the S21 mechanism, we will provide robust
training opportunities to encourage more participation in health disparities research focused on cardiometabolic
diseases. The impact will be establishment of a sustainable program that includes health disparity curricula for
graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow to tenure-track faculty development pathway, and a critical corpus of
health disparity researchers with active research projects in the area focused on cardiometabolic health
disparities. Leveraging our ongoing academic relationships with the neighboring undergraduate HBCUs, training
pathways in partnership with Tennessee State University and Fisk University, located in the one-mile corridor of
MMC, will create a scholarly environment for teaching and research to address the challenge of halting and
reducing the widening gap of cardiovascular health disparities within the minority populations of the US."

Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) proposes the Endowment for Learning Health
Systems and Learning Health Communities to create a Learning Health Systems and Learning Health
Communities (LHSC) Core. The NIMHD-Endowed Urban Health Institute (UHI) was established to house
infrastructure at CDU that facilitates minority health and health disparities research across all schools and
colleges, each of which strives to enhance scientific workforce diversity by training students from marginalized
communities or communities of color. UHI’s priority areas of research include cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardio-
metabolic, mental health, substance abuse, and health services and policy. Previous endowment efforts have
resulted in the creation of the Division of Community Engagement, which supports a community faculty track
and community/healthcare partners; the Student Research Core; and the Health Services Research Center
(HSRC) to support health services and policy research. The proposed endowment plan’s overarching
goal/mission is to expand and extend UHI’s research capacity with regard to community-engaged research
(CEnR) and its health services and biomedical research to address minority health and health disparities, and
to enhance the diversity of the scientific workforce at CDU and its surrounding community. CDU proposes to
create a Learning Health Systems and Learning Health Communities Core within UHI, a collaboration primarily
with (but not limited to) the HSRC, the Division of Community Engagement, the Bioinformatics Core, and the
Student Research Core to enhance the capacity to conduct cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardio-metabolic, mental health,
substance abuse, and health services research and increase the scientific workforce diversity.
The following three specific aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: To enhance institutional minority and health disparities research capacity and infrastructure
across all CDU schools and colleges by developing a Learning Health System and Communities (LHSC) Core
with a focus on, but not limited to, health services and community-engaged research.
Specific Aim 2: To enhance the diversity of the scientific workforce in minority health and health disparity
research by creating a pipeline for masters and doctoral programs for racial and ethnic minorities and plan a
doctoral program in biomedical sciences.
Specific Aim 3: To effectively manage the endowment portfolio at a level consistent with the highest fiduciary
standards in the United States."
10766815,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rural residents generally lack the needed level of physical activity to benefit health and reduce disparities in
chronic illness associated with physical inactivity, such as cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. The
Socioecological Model describes physical activity as involving a dynamic and reciprocal interaction between
individual, social, and community factors; therefore, interventions designed to promote physical activity are
likely to be most effective if they target individual, social and community factors. However, there is a dearth of
such multilevel interventions, particularly with rural communities. Community group-based walking programs
are widely used because of the strong evidence base for increasing physical activity through individual and
social factors. Civic engagement interventions aimed at improving the built environment for physical activity
have had beneficial impacts on community (built environment) and social factors. However, while both the
group-based walking and civic engagement interventions have been successful in rural communities, neither
targets all three factors. Additionally, relative to urban communities, rural communities generally lack the
necessary resources to implement public health programming. An innovative public health partner in rural
communities is public libraries; however, rural libraries often lack the capacity to implement evidence-based
programming. There is, therefore, a critical need to identify effective multilevel physical activity interventions
that promote regular physical activity and are applicable to and feasible in rural communities. The overall
objectives for this project are to increase rural libraries' capacity for program implementation and conduct a
comparative effectiveness study of a group-based walking (standard approach) versus a combined group-
based walking plus civic engagement program aimed at enhancing walkability to increase physical activity
among rural adults. We will also identify key mediators between the program effects and change in outcomes.
We will evaluate program implementation using a positive deviance analysis to understand experiences of high
and low changers at the individual level on key outcomes. We will match and randomize 16 towns to one of the
two approaches and enroll a total of 336 rural residents. Measurements will be taken at baseline and six,
twelve and twenty-four months. Our expected outcomes are to have built rural libraries capacity to implement
evidence-based programs and determined the amplified effects of a combined group-based walking plus civic
engagement program. We also expect to have determined that self-efficacy, social support, group cohesion,
and perceived environment are significant mediators. Finally, we anticipate having demonstrated successful
implementation of the combined program and a completed evaluation including a cost analysis. The positive
impact of these results is that strong definitive evidence of the effectiveness of a multilevel physical activity
intervention targeting rural residents will justify its continued development and future broad dissemination to
rural communities."
10766816,"SUMMARY
Metformin, the most widely prescribed medication for treating type 2 diabetes, is increasingly recognized for
healthspan effects that resemble exercise. The beneficial effects of metformin, like aerobic exercise, appear to
be mediated through an energetic and/or redox stress mechanism, raising the prospect that the two approaches
could exert additive or even synergistic effects. Surprisingly, our recently published clinical trial showed that
metformin inhibits the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise training (AET) on skeletal muscle mitochondrial
function and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, subjects who entered the study with the highest
mitochondrial complex I supported OXPHOS function and insulin sensitivity were the most negatively affected
by metformin treatment. How metformin inhibits the positive effects of AET, why this effect is most pronounced
in those with the highest mitochondrial function, and how these interactions ultimately impact healthspan and
lifespan are unknown. The hypothesis of this proposal is that the effects of metformin on healthspan and lifespan
are context specific; beneficial in the context of low energy demand/mitochondrial capacity but detrimental in the
context of high energy demand/mitochondrial capacity. To test this hypothesis, the study will leverage a rat model
with divergent selection for intrinsic aerobic capacity, referred to as high capacity and low capacity runners
(HCR/LCR). By selecting for maximal treadmill running capacity, LCR and HCR rats diverged in intrinsic
mitochondrial function, lifespan and metabolic traits that increase or decrease risk for chronic disease. Changes
in mitochondrial function will be assessed using ex vivo respirometry that measures the interplay among three
thermodynamic forces. Further, the proposal uses targeted kinetic and quantitative mitochondrial proteomics to
understand appropriate or aberrant cellular remodeling, and novel in vivo imaging approaches to understand
changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics. The Specific Aims are to: 1) establish if mitochondrial
changes to metformin treatment are context specific, 2) establish if the effects of metformin on adaptations to
aerobic exercise training are context specific, and 3) determine whether the beneficial effects of metformin on
healthspan and lifespan are context specific. It is expected that with metformin treatment, remodeling of
mitochondria will be consistent with improved outcomes in LCR rats, but have no effect or will be detrimental in
HCR, with or without exercise training. Further it is expected that metformin will extend healthspan and lifespan
in LCR rats, but not HCR rats. Successful completion of these aims will reveal the importance of context
specificity on metformin action and the mechanisms underlying its positive and potentially negative impacts on
healthspan and lifespan. This information is critical given the ever expanding off-target use of metformin in
healthy individuals without chronic disease and/or overt metabolic dysfunction. Results from this project will help
inform who can benefit from metformin treatment, and more importantly, who should avoid it."

Epidemiologic, imaging and pathological studies of the role of blood pressure variability in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
Project Summary 
The etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD; hereinafter, used interchangeably with dementia) in older adults is multifactorial, and vascular risk factors, especially hypertension, are major modifiable contributors. However, the relationship between blood pressure (BP) and dementia is far from clear. Increased BP variability over different periods has been linked to cardiovascular disease and mortality risk independent of static BP levels. Emerging evidence has also suggested BP variability as a novel risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. But the clinical translation of BP variability for the risk stratification and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias has been hampered by the lack of standards for assessing BP variability and the lack of knowledge on the underlying mechanisms. The goals of this project are to 1) comprehensively quantify the epidemiological relationship between BP variability and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and 2) identify the causal pathways linking BP variability to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. To accomplish these, the data from 6 prospective cohort studies across the US and Europe will be analyzed: the Framingham Heart Study, the Rotterdam Study, the Three-City Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project. In Aim 1, the relationship between 3 types of BP variability (visit-to-visit variability, beat-to-beat variability, and postural variability) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will be quantified by pooling individual data (n~31,274) from the above 6 cohort studies using consistent approaches. Aims 2 and 3 will further investigate the mechanisms underlying these epidemiologic relationships. Specifically, in Aim 2, the extent to which cerebral small vessel disease mediates the relationship between BP variability and the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among participants with brain MRI data will be determined using causal mediation analysis. Aim 3 (R00 phase) extends the investigation to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology using neuropathology and neuroimaging data, where the interplay between BP variability, vascular pathology, AD pathology and the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will be characterized. This K99 project will enhance the PI’s prior training in medicine and epidemiology and further expand her expertise in 1) causal inference methods, 2) employing neuroimaging and neuropathology data, and 3) incorporating clinical and mechanistic relevance in epidemiological studies. This project will enable the PI to establish herself as an independent researcher using advanced epidemiological methods and interdisciplinary skills to make significant contributions to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is effective at reducing viral load and suppressing HIV-1 infection,
however, there still is no cure for HIV-1 disease. This is due in part to the formation of latently infected cells
harboring integrated proviruses in tissue and cell reservoirs. Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) gene editing has shown promise as an HIV cure strategy. All Cas enzymes in use today initiate binding
by recognizing a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) followed by the complementarity between guide RNA (gRNA)
and target DNA to induce DNA cleavage. Subsequent double-strand break repair by endogenous cellular
processes has been shown to result in a non-random mutational distribution dictated by protospacer and flanking
sequence context. Furthermore, natural genetic variation within integrated proviral sequences has been shown
to decrease the CRISPR-mediated editing efficiency which is critically dependent for efficacy of the gRNA
selection process. The past funding period, we have designed a patented computational pipeline to select broad-
spectrum spCas9 gRNAs that account for HIV sequence variation within and between large numbers of
individuals and that have no off-target effect using predictive algorithms or functional assays. Preliminary data
presented here shows gRNAs have efficacy in other tissue compartments (brain) and across subtypes. In
addition to these gRNA design advances, the team also showed major advancements in delivery and
effectiveness in small animal studies and non-human primate studies. In order to better harness the utility of
CRISPR/Cas gene editing, this project will utilize novel high-throughput biologic assays combined with state-of-
the art computational biology to expand what is known about how novel Cas enzymes edit the DNA target in
vitro and test HIV-1-infected patient samples ex vivo and in vivo to optimize treatment strategy (Cas:gRNA
combination) selection to account for HIV sequence variation within and across tissue compartments (periphery
vs brain) and subtypes. Novel resources like the Multiple Lentiviral Expression System (MuLE) and the
Mammalian Synthetic Cellular Recorder Integrating Biological Events (mSCRIBE) will be leveraged to study Cas
enzymology and HIV-1 reactivation at the single-cell level. We hypothesize that, Cas:gRNA targeting will induce
safe and reproducible editing outcomes that are predictablly based on the enzyme, target, and surrounding
nucleotide sequence. To interrogate this hypothesis, three Specific Aims will be used: (i) develop a generic model
of Cas:gRNA combination repair outcomes, (ii) identify functional impact of Cas:gRNA pairs using molecular
recorders, and (iii) ex vivo and in vivo testing of combined Cas:gRNA pairs on HIV. These Aims will extend the
knowledge of CRIPSR editing technologies for all fields of biology using the HIV platform. It will do this in cells
important for HIV research in the periphery and the CNS (T, monocyte, microglia) and under different activation
states. For HIV specifically, it will extend Cas:gRNA design into other tissues and between subtypes to develop
a highly significant and innovative approach to target the HIV-1 quasispecies. This will result in a highly effective
treatment strategy for using CRISPR gene-editing as a potential cure for HIV infection and disease."

The AADR Mentoring an Inclusive Network for a Diverse Workforce of the Future (AADR MIND
the Future) aims to develop a national and sustainable mentoring and mentor training network
with educational activities and interactive opportunities across the network, between mentors
and mentees within and beyond the home institutions to support the development of a diverse
cadre of dental, oral and craniofacial researchers to advance the objectives of the NIDCR
Strategic Plan and Strategic Priorities. Specific objectives of AADR MIND the Future are: to
support the development of a diverse cadre of early career dental, oral and craniofacial
researchers; to incorporate personal career development techniques for new investigators; to
create a diverse national and sustainable mentoring and mentor training network; to develop a
lasting educational plan based on existing paradigms in thematic domains – research/technical;
career development/personal growth; and mentor-mentee interpersonal relationships; to
enhance collaborations with a variety of institutions and organizations to sustain the network of
diverse mentees, mentors and program alumni, who could eventually serve the program. The
principle purpose of the network is to develop a national and sustainable mentoring program,
which will be centrally administered by the AADR and will specifically facilitate a diverse pool of
early career investigators, including those from groups identified as underrepresented in dental,
oral and craniofacial research and transition to the next career stage and to develop a high
quality independently funded research program. In the long term, this AADR program will
engage mentor and mentees with the goal to guide individual career development as well as to
improve the quality of mentoring at the home institution through dissemination of the lessons
learned by mentors and mentees in the network. The AADR Mind the Future program is a
national network of 11 universities and three organizations who will be intricately involved in the

10783686,"The study of rare diseases often informs more common pathologies. We have extensively studied the NLRP3
inflammasome, which is mutated in autoinflammatory disorders such as cryopyrin-associated periodic
syndromes (CAPS). A major feature of these conditions is excessive production of IL-1β, which is also highly
induced by procedures such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, commonly used to kill malignant cells or as a
conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). IL-1β potently promotes bone resorption while
simultaneously inhibiting bone formation, but IL-1 blocking agents have limited efficacy in the treatment of
syndrome-associated bone pathologies. This suggests that other actions of the inflammasomes beyond IL-1β
processing, contribute to adverse skeletal effects in diseases. The inflammasomes are responsible for the
maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. Recent studies have identified GSDMD as an additional critical substrate of the
inflammasomes. Activated GSDMD translocates to the plasma membrane where it forms pores through which
IL-1β and IL-18 are secreted. However, excessive pore formation compromises membrane integrity, releasing
pro-inflammatory cytoplasmic contents into the extracellular environment. This form of cell death, termed
pyroptosis is inflammatory. Thus, while GSDMD is a normal participant in immune responses and tissue repair,
its chronic activation promotes inflammation. We surmise that the concomitant release of multiple inflammatory
factors during pyroptosis causes pathological bone loss. Therefore, inhibition of GSDMD could provide
superior efficacy over IL-1 blockade, not only in the context of CAPS, but also radiation and chemotherapy.
Recent drug discovery efforts have identified disulfiram as an antagonist of GSDMD-pore forming activity.
Disulfiram is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol addiction. We found that administration of
disulfiram to mice inhibited LPS-stimulated IL-1β production. Disulfiram also inhibited IL-1β secretion,
pyroptosis and osteoclast (OC) differentiation in vitro. To further study the role of GSDMD in bone resorption,
we determined skeletal impact of GSDMD loss-of-function in mouse models. Preliminary results indicate that
baseline bone mass was higher in Gsdmd-/- compared to WT mice. Moreover, the exuberant OC formation that
occurred in CAPS mice was normalized upon Gsdmd ablation. Gsdmd null mice were also resistant to
radiation/BMT-induced bone loss. In vitro data further demonstrated that expression of GSDMD was up-
regulated during OC differentiation, and genetic ablation of this protein decreased OC formation. These results
suggest that GSDMD is functional in OC without compromising their survival, and regulates bone resorption.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that GSDMD regulates bone resorption in pathological conditions
through mechanisms involving its actions in inflammatory cells and OC lineage. We will test this hypothesis in
two Aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of GSDMD in bone resorption in pathological conditions. Aim 2: Define
the role of GSDMD in the OC lineage and elucidate the mechanisms of its activation in these cells."
10786085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes fill a crucial role in adaptive immunity by virtue of their ability to recognize
and eliminate pathogen-infected cells and nascent tumors. To accomplish this important function, the T cell
antigen receptor (TCR) expressed by CD8 T cells must recognize a pathogen-derived peptide in the context of
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I receptor (pMHC). In response to a pathogen infection this
TCR-pMHC recognition event by CD8 T cells is crucial in dictating how the ensuing adaptive response
manifests. Thus, TCR signaling by naïve CD8 T cells is not only important in initiating a protective response
but TCR signaling by effector CD8 T cells also underlies its cytotoxic activity for the efficient elimination of
infected cells. Accordingly, appropriate TCR-signaling is central for the activation, robust proliferation and
function of effector and memory CD8 T cells that ultimately leads to the trafficking of pathogen-specific CD8 T
cells to sites of infection and elimination of infected cells via CD8 T cell cytolytic activity.
 Work from our lab has revealed that an endogenous extracellular lysophospholipid, lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA), signals via the LPAR5 G-protein coupled receptor expressed by mature human and mouse T cells
and negatively regulates TCR signaling, proliferation and cytotoxic activity. Notably, this lipid and the secreted
enzyme responsible for its synthesis are often elevated in inflammatory settings including a number of chronic
pathogen infections. Yet, how LPA regulates CD8 T cell biology at these pathophysiological levels or at
homeostatic endogenous levels has only been cursorily examined and is not well understood. The experiments
described in this proposal are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular
mechanisms by which the LPAR5 signaling negatively impacts TCR signaling and in vivo CD8 T cell immunity.
In addition, given that LPA levels are often increased in chronic infections, we also propose to determine if
pathogens that establish chronic infections subvert LPA production to suppress T cell immunity and whether
small molecule inhibitors are able to antagonize LPAR5 signaling to promote enhanced immunity.
 The successful completion of these studies is thus expected to not only extend our current
understanding of how CD8 T cells are regulated to provide protective immunity against pathogen infections but
also may reveal new avenues of therapeutic intervention that may enhance immunity to persistent infections of
global health concern."

Islet glucose-stimulated somatostatin (Sst) secretion is lost in patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D) and in animal
models of the disease, which contributes to disrupted glucagon and insulin secretion. It is generally accepted
that Sst secretion from -cells occurs in response to elevated intracellular Ca2+, which primarily results from
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ (Ca2+ER) release. However, the mechanisms that control -cell Ca2+ER handling
and how they are altered in T2D are largely unknown. Data from our lab finds that the islet-enriched two-pore-
domain K+ channel, TALK-1, is an ER localized channel in that provides a countercurrent for -cell Ca2+ER release
and Ca2+ER leak. TALK-1-mediated augmentation of the electrochemical driving force for -cell Ca2+ER leak con-
strains Ca2+ER storage, which limits glucose-stimulated Ca2+ER release and Sst secretion. Further data show that
-cell Ca2+ER release and Sst secretion are amplified by glucose-induced allosteric activation of -cell Ca2+-sens-
ing receptors (CaSRs). Finally, our preliminary data provide the first evidence that diabetic conditions diminish
-cell Ca2+ER storage, which contributes to perturbations in glucose-stimulated Ca2+ handling and Sst secretion
under diabetic conditions. Based on these exciting preliminary data, the overall objective of this proposal is to
elucidate how -cell Ca2+ER is controlled and becomes disrupted during the pathogenesis of diabetes. This project
will test the central hypothesis that glucose-stimulated -cell Sst secretion is amplified by CaSR-mediated Ca2+ER
release, which is controlled by TALK-1 channel constraint of Ca2+ER storage. The rationale that underlies this
project is that understanding how CaSR and TALK-1 control -cell Ca2+ER handling and Sst secretion will expose
novel therapeutic targets for restoring glucose-stimulated Sst secretion and islet hormone secretion in T2D. This
project will be accomplished with the following two specific aims: 1) Determine how -cell CaSR controls Ca2+ER
handling, Sst secretion, and islet hormone secretion; and 2) Determine how TALK-1 channel control of Ca2+ER
release modulates -cell function and dysfunction. Under the first aim, transgenic mice with -cell ablation of
CaSR as well as human pseudoislets with ShRNA knockdown of -cell CaSR will be utilized to assess the roles
of the Ca2+-sensing receptor during secretagogue modulation of -cell Ca2+ handling and Sst secretion. Aim1 will
also determine how depletion of -cell Ca2+ER stores under diabetic conditions impacts CaSR signaling and Sst
secretion. Under the second aim, the function TALK-1 channels on -cell Ca2+ER handling and function will be
determined in mice with -cell specific ablation of TALK-1 and in human pseudoislets containing either -cells
with knockdown of TALK-1 or expressing dominant negative TALK-1 channel subunits. Furthermore, Aim2 will
determine how TALK-1 augmentation of -cell Ca2+ER depletion under the stressful conditions associated with
diabetes contributes to -cell dysfunction. This project is significant because it is expected to illuminate mecha-
nisms that alter -cell Ca2+ER handling and disrupt islet hormone secretion in T2D. Moreover, this project will
identify pharmacological strategies for normalizing Sst secretion and reducing islet dysfunction in T2D."

10931556,"Opioid-use disorder (OUD) is a major public health problem, affecting over 2.7 million people and resulting in
over 90,000 deaths in 2020 in the U.S., as well as broadly impacting the mental and physical health of
individuals suffering from an OUD and the communities and families of affected individuals. Treatment
effectiveness for OUD depends on retention in care. Unfortunately, a systematic review reported that the
median retention rate at 6 months for Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) programs across 19
studies was only 58%. Sleep disturbances have been identified as predictors of treatment attrition and are
related to OUD through bi-directional pathways involving pain, stress, and emotional dysregulation, and could
serve as future intervention targets to improve OUD outcomes. However, there is a limited understanding of
the predictive value of specific measures of sleep and circadian rhythm during early recovery, and almost no
data on how sleep and circadian parameters interact with other risk factors for MOUD outcomes. We have
assembled a team of sleep scientists, addiction medicine specialists, biostatisticians, and clinical trialists and
will leverage the exceptional resources of Brigham and Women's Hospital's Program in Sleep Medicine
Epidemiology, Sleep Reading Center, and Division of Biostatistics at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute to
lead the Leadership and Data Coordinating Center (LDCC) for this multi-site study. The LDCC will develop a
Common Protocol for the collection of standardized data for predicting MOUD outcomes across four Research
Centers and will lead, coordinate, and implement all aspects of this common protocol, providing
comprehensive, responsive, and innovative data and project management. It will facilitate recruitment and data
sharing and support the rigorous collection and analyses of comprehensive sleep measurements. In addition to
risk factors suggested by existing prediction models and HEAL initiative common data elements, sleep will be
assessed by EEG -- a biomarker of neurophysiology and psychiatric diseases -- and will be measured on two
nights approximately one month apart from 400 patients enrolled in a MOUD program. Sleep macro- and
micro-architecture will be derived using centralized sleep scoring and advanced EEG quantitative signal
analysis. Sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements, sleep-wake patterns and circadian risk factors
will be measured by polysomnography, validated questionnaires and multiple day Fitbit trackers. The primary
endpoint will be treatment retention at 6 months after study enrollment. Secondary outcomes will include time
to treatment drop out, and illicit drug use and non-medical opioid use; opioid craving; withdrawal symptoms;
alcohol use; pain intensity and interference; physical functioning; sleep disturbance and quality measured at 6-
month. We will adopt an ensemble algorithm (the Super Learner) to develop the prediction model that finds the
optimal combination of a collection of statistical and machine learning algorithms. This data-science based plan
and our multi-disciplinary expertise will ensure that the goals of this study are met."

Most smokers want to quit smoking, and most smokers try to quit smoking each year. Yet, most attempts to quit
smoking fail. FDA-approved pharmacotherapies can help, but non-response, either through relapse or through
inability to initiate cessation, is still the most common outcome. Despite the frequency of treatment non-response,
few trials have investigated the best path forward for treatment in these instances—should smokers try to quit
again with the same pharmacotherapy, consistent with package guidelines to continue with treatment for 12
weeks, or should early failure be preempted and met with a change in pharmacotherapy? Further, for smokers
who have tried to quit with pharmacotherapy multiple times and are still smoking, is it better to switch to a less
harmful tobacco product rather than trying to quit repeatedly with FDA-approved pharmacotherapy? The
proposed adaptive treatment trial will test whether 1) switching between pharmacotherapies following an initial
failure better promotes abstinence than a repeated attempt with the same pharmacotherapy, and 2) whether
switching to e-cigarettes following successive failures with multiple pharmacotherapies better promotes
abstinence from cigarettes than a third attempt to quit with the same course of pharmacotherapy. Daily smokers
across South Carolina and Alabama who are willing to set a quit date (N=544) will be provided with a 4-week
supply of FDA approved smoking-cessation medication and provided with instructions to set a date and to quit
smoking completely. First-course medication will be either combination nicotine replacement therapy
(transdermal nicotine patch and oral nicotine lozenge) or varenicline, counterbalanced. After four weeks of
treatment, those who have not responded to initial treatment (i.e., non-responders) will be assigned in a 2:1
fashion to either Adaptive Treatment (medication switch) or Non-Adaptive Treatment (medication continuance;
Aim 1). After a second four weeks of treatment, non-responders will be assigned in a 2:1 fashion to either a Harm
Reduction Approach (to switch to a less harmful tobacco product; e-cigarettes) or Non-Adaptive Treatment
(medication continuance; Aim 2), again with instructions to switch or quit completely. Outcomes include
biochemically-confirmed 7-day abstinence from smoking, smoking reduction, measures of dependence, duration
of abstinence, and dual use, each measured at key intervention timepoints: after each course of treatment, with
follow-up through six months. This innovative R01 application is led by two seasoned investigators with expertise
in smoking cessation, harm reduction, and remote clinical trials. The research question is highly significant and
is positioned to provide strong, data-driven guidance on treatment decision making for the most common problem
facing even the best treatments for smoking: failure. Trial results provide a significant opportunity to optimize
cessation outcomes for smokers who continue to struggle in quitting."
10892272,"ABSTRACT
The maintenance of an intact alveolar epithelial barrier is crucial for lung function. Failure of steady-state
replacement or post-injury regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells underlies the pathogenesis of many lung
diseases. In recent years, certain subgroups of cells have been identified as putative stem/progenitor cells in the
alveolar epithelium during homeostasis and regeneration. However, the identities of these cells and the
mechanisms regulating their behavior are still incompletely understood. Recent studies have indicated that some
immunity related signaling molecules can regulate the activity of alveolar epithelial progenitors, but the
mechanisms that direct these signaling events during lung homeostasis or regeneration have not been well
characterized. The objective of this proposal is to determine the distinct roles of immunity related signaling
pathways in the regulation of alveoli progenitor cell functions, both during steady-state maintenance as well as
post injury repair. An additional goal is to explore the possibility that dysregulation of these signaling processes
is related to chronical lung diseases such as emphysema or fibrosis. Two types of epithelial cells cover the lung
alveoli: alveolar type I cells (AT1) cover >95% of the surface area and facilitate O2-CO2 exchange, whereas
alveolar type II cells (AT2) are responsible for the secretion of surfactant. Importantly, AT2s also function as
stem/progenitor cells by undergoing self-renewal and differentiation into AT1s. In preliminary studies, we
demonstrated that 1) A small subset of AT2s (1-3% of total) showed stem cell characteristics indicating a role of
these cells for steady-state maintenance of alveoli. These cells had intrinsic NFκB and STAT1 activity and these
immunity related signals were able to regulate their progenitor functions; 2) After bacterial induced lung injury,
more AT2s are activated and behave as facultative stem cells to repair the alveoli. The reparative functions of
these cells are regulated by STAT1 and STAT3 mediated signals; and 3) AT2 specific disruption of STAT1
causes sustained fibrosis after bleomycin induced lung injury. This effect is likely induced by an aberrant
subpopulation of AT2/AT1 intermediate cells resulting from a failed transition of AT2s to AT1s. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that the progenitor function of a subset of AT2s in alveolar homeostasis and post injury
regeneration is regulated by distinct immunity related signals. Disruption of these signals is related to the
pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases. We will test these ideas with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To
determine how NFκB and STAT1 mediated immunity related signaling regulates the stem cell properties of
CD44high AT2 subsets during steady-state homeostasis. Aim 2: To determine the role of STAT1/STAT3
dependent, likely NFκB independent, immunity signaling in regulating the facultative progenitor cell functions of
AT2 cells in post injury repair. The goal of these studies is to advance our understanding of molecular
mechanisms underlying alveolar homeostasis and repair in mouse and human lungs, and to identify novel
therapeutic targets to prevent complications related to insufficient epithelial steady-state replacement or repair."
10781488,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Relapsed disease is a key challenge in cancer biology and medicine. Cancer cells are dynamic and exist in
flexibly interconverting and epigenetically-specified states regulated by master transcription factors (mTFs).
These mTFs determine the transcriptome and resultant malignant phenotype, including controlling striking
differences in sensitivity to chemotherapies. The presence of cellular heterogeneity within tumors, driven by
epigenetic control of cell state is a mechanism by which tumor cells may escape from treatment. This has been
challenging to study, since tumors are commonly marked by a high mutational load, which may obscure the
contribution of cell state. Intriguingly, the pediatric high-risk tumor neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogenous and
lethal tumor associated with epigenetically-plastic cell states, and is marked by a low mutational burden. This
makes NB an ideal system to study the contribution of cell state to chemosensitivity. Our long-term goal is to
use epigenomic control of cell state to develop mechanistically-based, targeted cancer therapies. The objective
of this proposal is to interrogate how mTFs control cell state and chemosensitivity in NB. Our central
hypothesis is that chemoresistance and sensitivity are controlled by the mTFs that establish the NB
transcriptome and cell state. This hypothesis is formulated based on preliminary data using new systems
including cell state reporters and genome engineering coupled with chemical biology to dissect these flexibly-
interconverting cell states, termed the “adrenergic (ADRN)” and “mesenchymal (MES)” – states. The rationale
for this work is that the MES and ADRN NB cell states display differential sensitivity to chemotherapies and
reflect mechanisms by which NB cells evade conventional therapy, driving lethal tumor relapse. This hypothesis
will be tested in two parallel specific aims: 1) Interrogating the transcriptional controllers of the MES NB state
and leveraging this for therapeutic benefit; and 2) Dissecting the transcriptional maintenance of the ADRN state.
First, we will use our reporters, with gene editing and re-expression models, to determine how candidate mTFs
initiate and maintain the MES state. We will identify and interrogate MES-specific catalytic targets, to disrupt this
chemoresistant, high-risk state. Second, we will use chemical biology approaches in new models of ADRN NB
to dissect how mTFs maintain the ADRN chemosensitive state. Using epigenomics and nascent transcriptomics,
we will determine and validate the targets regulated by each mTF that establish chemosensitivity. These
approaches are innovative as they use new approaches including cell state reporters and chemical degradation
to dissect cell state heterogeneity in NB, to illuminate mechanisms of cell state and chemoresistance control. As
a result, we expect to identify new vulnerabilities, thereby achieving new research horizons. This approach is
significant because it will expand our understanding of how mTFs control cell state and chemoresistance in NB,
and identify new, cell-state-specific vulnerabilities. This has the potential to change management of children with
NB, while also impacting our understanding of chemoresistant cell state regulation broadly in cancer."
10765584,"SUMMARY: Circadian rhythm is important for human physiology and health. Human body temperature
increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. This body temperature rhythm (BTR) is a robust
output of the circadian clock and is fundamental for maintaining homeostasis and its related processes, such
as sleep and metabolism. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular and neural
mechanisms by which BTR is regulated and how BTR is related to sleep regulation.
 To understand the mechanisms of BTR, we use Drosophila. This model has provided many strong
contributions to studying the circadian clock, including the discovery of conserved mammalian circadian clock
genes and mechanisms. We demonstrated that Drosophila exhibits a circadian rhythm of temperature
preference, referred to as temperature preference rhythms (TPR). While mammals regulate BTR by generating
or losing internal heat, small ectotherms, including Drosophila, regulate BTR via selecting an environmental
temperature. As flies are small ectotherms, their body temperature is close to that of the surrounding
environment. Thus, Drosophila TPR produces BTR in a similar pattern as mammals. Furthermore, our study
provides the first evidence that fly DH31R and its mammalian homolog, Calcitonin receptor, CALCR, regulate
BTR. Thus, understanding fly TPR will provide fundamental insights into the molecular and neural mechanisms
that control BTR in mammals.
 Using fly TPR, in this study, we will address an outstanding knowledge gap regarding how
temperature fluctuations are determined and how the preferred temperature is set at a specific time of day. We
will elucidate the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying TPR. We will examine the distinct functions of
each pacemaker by manipulating their activities and neuropeptide-receptor signals which could control
temperature fluctuation or temperature setpoint. We will clarify the mechanistic difference between TPR and
locomotor activity, focusing on a noncanonical pathway that we anticipate to be a specific regulator of TPR.
This study will unveil the unique neural circuits controlling fly TPR. Further, we will take advantage of fly TPR
and determine the mechanistic link between temperature change and sleep; their relationship has been well
known, but the underpinning molecular mechanism has been a big mystery. This study will facilitate an
understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying BTR and its relationship to sleep.
 We have shown that parallel mechanistic functions between mammalian BTR and fly TPR; thus, the
basic foundation of BTR is aligned with fly TPR. The outcome of this R35 proposal will facilitate to reveal BTR
mechanisms in mammals and lend actionable insights into the treatment of circadian clock diseases, sleep
problems, and the health of night-shift workers."
10765587,"Interactions between peptides and their substrates play a central role in many cellular processes and computational
methods, such as automated docking, are used to gain a mechanistic understanding of these interactions. While docking
small molecules works well, peptide-docking remains a challenging, relatively new, and fast evolving field with direct and
high translational impact. We have been at the forefront of developing physics-based peptide-docking methods. Emerging
deep learning methods (DL) such as AlphaFold are deeply impacting structural biology and have recently been shown to
perform well for predicting protein-peptide interactions. We propose to further develop and enhance cutting-edge
approaches for the prediction of peptide interactions with their binding partners, with a special focus on expanding
coverage of the chemical space of building blocks used to synthesize therapeutic peptides. To this end, we will extend our
state-of-the-art peptide docking software program AutoDock CrankPep to support non-standard amino-acids, and
additional peptide cyclization modes. We will also develop novel scoring functions specifically designed for peptide
docking. Furthermore, physics-based and DL-based peptide docking methods are complementary and we have evidence
that they can be synergistically combined to leverage their respective strengths. These combined docking strategies will
further extend the range of biological questions and biomedical targets for which peptide docking can be applied. Finally,
we will extend peptide-docking methods for predicting peptide-peptide interactions. Such a method will have a
significant impact on the development of peptide-based therapeutic approaches.
We will continue to collaborate with experimental biologists as the biological systems they study challenge our software
tools and drive their development and extension with new methods. Furthermore, these collaborations provide us with
data beyond the traditional benchmark datasets for validating and refining our computational methods and predictions.
These collaborations span from translational applications such as the development of vaccines against the flue or
molecules used to prevent brain damage in stroke patients, to pioneering the use of computational structural biology
approaches to study small Open Reading Frame (smORFs) encoded polypeptides, an exciting emerging new frontier in
biology.
We have a long-standing track record of promoting diversity in our research team, of implementing best practices in
software development, and producing and distributing production-grade, open-source software, widely used by large and
growing and diverse community. The software tools resulting from this project will be developed and distributed using the
same principles, supporting the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extending their use to an even
wider community. These software programs will support the preclinical design of peptide-based therapeutic molecules
and approaches, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research as well as fundamental aspects of structural
biology."

Toxicity and drug resistance limit the efficacy of antiviral therapy for cytomegalovirus
(CMV) disease in immunosuppressed hosts such as cancer and transplant recipients.
Current therapy includes DNA polymerase inhibitors ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir.
The terminase inhibitor letermovir was recently approved for prophylaxis, and the UL97
kinase inhibitor maribavir has completed Phase 3 trial as alternative therapy. In clinical
practice, CMV drug resistance cannot be diagnosed by direct phenotypic testing of viral
isolates, and instead is dependent on an accurate correlation of detected viral mutations
and associated resistance phenotypes. The objective of this research is to determine the
genetic mechanisms of CMV drug resistance in order to improve clinical diagnosis and
the development of new antivirals. Many resistance mutations and polymorphisms in the
CMV UL97 kinase, UL54 DNA polymerase and UL56/UL89/UL51 terminase genes have
been and continue to be phenotyped, with diagnostically important new resistance loci
being identified during each project period. Technical advances in recombinant
phenotyping and whole genome deep sequencing are facilitating this research. In the
upcoming project period, new focus areas include the characterization of mutations
selected after drug exposure in genes outside of known antiviral targets, and analysis of
the effects of baseline viral strain variation on drug susceptibility. Specific aims are (1)
study the evolution and phenotypes of CMV mutations that develop after in vitro or in
vivo exposure to antiviral compounds and combinations; (2) evaluate the phenotypic
significance of genetic changes identified by viral whole genome deep sequencing that
are outside of known antiviral target genes, and (3) determine the impact of baseline
viral strain on drug susceptibility phenotypes by characterization of alternative viral
clones and host cells."
10766688,"PROJECT SUMMARY
COVID-19 remains an ongoing global health crisis, in part due to emerging variants. Fundamental questions
remain about the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection drives inflammation in the lower lung, in part
due to the lack of in vitro infection models. Better understanding of variant biology and the immune pathways
involved in early SARS-CoV-2 infection could offer insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
The antiviral cytokines type I interferons and their downstream effects have been implicated in COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit or promote interferon effects in some cell types in the lung, and this may differ
between viral variants. My preliminary work shows that organoids and lung slice cultures can be used to study
these early events in SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies macrophages as a cell type that activates the
interferon pathway in infected cultures. Thus, I propose using quantitative PCR, single-cell RNA sequencing,
and flow cytometry to study viral variants and to deeply profile the changes to viral and host gene and protein
expression during infection. I will study highly relevant cell types that can interact with each other in a similar
fashion to the in vivo lung. I will study the interferon stimulated gene response and identify the cell types in
which it is being modulated or would be good targets for therapeutic intervention. This knowledge will be critical
to our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
I am currently a fellow in Dr. Catherine Blish’s lab in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stanford University
and I am in the process of being promoted to a full time Instructor position. Stanford University offers an
outstanding scientific environment, where all the resources necessary to the success of this project are made
available to me. My long-term goal is to become an independent physician-scientist, with a research focus in
respiratory viral pathogenesis. I aim to establish a research program focused on modeling established and
emerging infections in primary lung tissue with a goal of developing new treatments.
To achieve this goal, I have designed a tailored career development plan that comprises both formal and
informal training. This training will enhance my expertise in lung biology, immunology, and sequencing
analysis. Informal training in these topics will be provided by my mentor, Dr. Catherine Blish, and by the rest of
my advisory committee, Dr. Calvin Kuo, Dr. Mark Krasnow, Dr. Susan Holmes, and Dr. Ben Pinsky. With their
guidance, I will complete the proposed project, submit research manuscripts, obtain further funding, and obtain
an independent research position."
10766690,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a critical public health concern, given its negative quality of life
impacts, increasing prevalence rates, and high health care utilization costs. Two-thirds of the ASD population
have co-occurring psychiatric disorders. These individuals require intensive interventions to address
psychiatrically related aberrant behaviors (e.g., irritability and hyperactivity), which are the source of much of
the disability and cost for this population. The goal of this project is to assess physiological mechanisms
underlying Therapeutic Horseback Riding’s (THR) previously observed significant positive effects on
ASD youth, particularly those with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and to further evaluate
durability, dose, and sub-population effects of the intervention. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that
physiological response patterns of salivary cortisol, cardiovascular, and electrodermal activity account for our
previously observed significant outcomes (i.e., reduced irritability and hyperactivity, and improved social and
communication), and additional outcomes (emotion regulation and caregiver quality of life), in youth ages 6-16
yrs. with ASD and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses randomized to a 10-week manualized THR intervention
compared to a no-horse Barn Activity (BA) control. Our preliminary findings suggest the psychiatrically
challenged ASD majority may be more likely to benefit from THR, particularly if outcomes are mediated by
physiological arousal. Aim 2: Evaluate the durability of Aim 1 outcomes in the THR group compared to the BA
control group six-months after the intervention period, given our preliminary evidence for maintenance of initial
outcome gains in a six-month follow-up. Aim 3: Explore dose and sub-population effects of THR and BA
interventions by comparing effect size differences in THR and BA groups to a: (1) 10-week wait-list control
group; (2) Hybrid intervention group (five weeks BA followed by five weeks THR); and (3) subsample of the
THR study population randomized following psychiatric hospitalization.
 Our preliminary results, obtained at both PATH international premiere accredited riding centers proposed in
the current application demonstrate that peripheral physiological arousal data collection is feasible with ASD
youth while engaged in THR. We have also partially replicated our previous results and demonstrated that
cortisol is a viable target mediator of THR effects on aberrant behaviors in ASD youth that merits further
investigation. Our proposal has the potential to advance the field of human-animal interaction (HAI), specifically
THR, for individuals with ASD and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. It also stands to guide future researchers
interested in better understanding the physiological mechanisms associated with HAI. Our long-range goal is
to empirically establish THR as an ecologically valid, transdiagnostic intervention that targets underlying
psychophysiological arousal states in youth with a variety of mental health issues, facilitating acquisition and
long-term maintenance of critical life skills that enhance quality of life for individuals and their caregivers."

organelles play crucial roles not only in the production of ATP, but also in a wide variety of other biochemical
processes, making mitochondrial function a key determinant of cellular health. Disruption of mitochondrial
homeostasis contributes to a number of chronic diseases, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, and
cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and even aging. Mitochondria undergo constant surveillance and
homeostatic rebalancing to avoid spiraling into a dysfunctional cascade that will inevitably trigger apoptosis or
other cell death pathways. A variety of readouts, including mitochondrial proteostasis and bioenergetics, are
constantly tracked and these inputs are integrated into coherent, retrograde signaling programs that coordinate
gene expression with the nucleus. The most studied of these is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
(UPRmt), which primarily responds to compromised mitochondrial protein import. Recent results from my lab
have increasingly demonstrated that another key component of mitochondrial surveillance is the ESRE
pathway. The ESRE (ethanol and stress response element) pathway is comprised of evolutionarily-conserved
genes containing a strongly conserved, 11-nucleotide motif (TCTGCGTCTCT) in their promoters. These genes
were first identified by their upregulation during acute ethanol exposure, but we have demonstrated that the
ESRE pathway detects mitochondrial damage, specifically increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.
Importantly, compromised ESRE function reduced survival during stress and overexpression of ESRE
machinery extended lifespan in unstressed conditions. Recent discoveries from my lab have identified box C/D
snoRNPs and the Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 as critical regulators of ESRE activity. Finally, we have
identified a strong candidate for the transcription factor that binds the ESRE motif.
 Despite our recent progress, critical gaps remain in our understanding of how ESRE contributes to
mitochondrial health. Questions of particular interest include: how is the signal for ESRE activation propagated
to the nucleus once it is detected? Have we correctly identified the transcription factor that binds the ESRE
motif? What is the mechanism used by box C/D snoRNPs to regulate ESRE function? Is MDT-15 acting in a
non-canonical role to regulate ESRE activity? We will continue to use a variety of biochemical, genetic, and cell
biological techniques, supplemented with new ‘omics-based approaches to expand our understanding of this
network and its role in maintaining mitochondrial health. This enhanced understanding will be key to translating
our discoveries into tangible gains in improvements in health across the lifespan."

Puerto Rico (PR) faces frequent power outages due to damage caused by natural disasters to its electric grid.
Aging Puerto Ricans (≥50 years) are a vulnerable population during natural disasters as they are more likely to
have multiple chronic health conditions when compared to other non-Hispanic whites and other Hispanic
groups in the US. Power outages can increase these disparities, and elevate morbidity and mortality due to co-
morbid conditions. Research has demonstrated that energy independence has positive health impacts. Energy
independence through direct access to solar power has begun to appear in PR through the work of the non-
profit community organization Casa Pueblo (CP). We propose to explore, from a multilevel perspective, the
factors that enable local government agencies, communities and individuals to adapt to energy independence
in their settings, and their implications for chronic disease management via these aims: Aim 1 – Through our
partnership with CP, explore the process experienced by communities and the aging population (≥50 years)
living with chronic diseases while adapting to energy independence (e.g., introduction of the technology,
training on its use, access to energized communal points) in order to better understand how communal
characteristics (e.g., collective identity, perceived individualism) can hinder or foster CDM among those with
renal disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes. Aim 2 – Systematically document from a multilevel
perspective (i.e., individual, community and structural) the perceived barriers and facilitators for adopting
energy independence strategies in PR. Aim 3 – Document resilience related variables at the individual level
(e.g., self-efficacy, positive attitudes, knowledge, altruism), communal (e.g., emotional connection, group
membership), and structural (i.e., power outages, geographical variables) levels that can foster effective CDM
among aging populations in need of electricity-based treatments (i.e., renal disease, respiratory diseases,
diabetes). To achieve Aim 1 and 2, we will conduct: (a) a detailed ethnographic observation/mapping of CP,
involving 30 months of immersive and ongoing institutional exchange and (b) a multilevel analysis of the
community-based energy independence through 45 tiered in-depth interviews with individuals ≥50 years with a
range of access to CP’s solar installations: 1) direct access (n=15), indirect access (n=15) and no access
(n=15). In addition, we will conduct qualitative interviews with individuals engaged at the policy-, administrative-
or technical-levels working within the field of sustainable energy and disaster recovery (n=15). To achieve Aim
3, we will administer a survey to a sample of 345 aging persons in the town of Adjuntas who have direct,
indirect and no access to independent energy sources. Our research will contribute to policy development and
dissemination regarding the role of community engagement and energy independence in managing chronic

Given the complex composition of pollutants such as particulate matter PM in the environment, it is
believed that our exposure is not limited to one chemical at a time but to several possible mixtures with
varying composition and mix ratios. These mixtures could be formed because they are emitted at the
same time from the same source origin as latent factors. As a result, humans are more susceptible to
exposure to these mixtures as characterized by these latent factors. Factor analysis is one tool used in
the literature to define mixtures. Unfortunately statistical methods of identifying mixtures are limited.
Additionally, exposure to PM chemicals during pregnancy is known to be harmful to both mother and
child. To address the problem a new method of identifying mixtures exposure based on extension of the
traditional factor analysis combined with source apportionment methods will be used. This proposal will
test the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Exposure to PM mixture metals during pregnancy increased
the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among black and Hispanic minorities and vary by
trimester. Hypothesis 2: CVD risk factors are mediators between PM metals exposure and child
development, through the following Aims. 1) Quantify mixtures and estimate mother's exposure during
various trimesters of pregnancy. We will use the newly developed Bayesian extended factor analysis
(FA), based on the flexibility of Bayesian statistics and the decomposition of the error covariance matrix
combined with SAM models to estimate metal mixtures. We will perform a spatio-temporal analysis of
the mixtures using Generalized Additive Mixed Models(GAMM). We will use the inverse distance
weighting method to estimate mother's inhaled quantities during each trimester of pregnancy. 2)
Investigate CVD risk factors difference among black and white and interaction between air pollution and
race/ethnicity by trimester. We will use logistic regression analysis and generalized spatial linear model
for this aim. 3) Investigate CVD risk factors moderating between mixture metals exposure and infant
mortality. We will use structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate wich risk factors is in the
pathway between exposure and child mortality. Results from the proposed studies could have
implications in identifying mixtures exposures, their chemical toxicity and relative implication in CVD
during pregnancy."
10766742,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although the general population continues to be at risk of exposure to ionizing radiation because of nuclear
warfare, terrorism, or radiological accidents, there are currently no biomarker assays that are predictive of
radiation-induced late injury in specific organs. In cases of heterogeneous exposures and for victims who
survive the acute effects, there will be a latent period of months to decades before serious symptoms manifest.
This proposal brings together an inter-disciplinary research team with expertise in radiation biology, animal
models of tissue injury, biomarker development, biostatistics and bioinformatics to identify analytically validated
rapid and minimally invasive assays that predict delayed radiation injury in different organ systems. Discovery
and validation of radiation biomarkers are based on the underlying premises that: 1) a signature of radiation
exposure is present in biofluids (plasma and urine) at some point prior to clinical diagnosis; and 2) early
diagnosis can result in improved clinical care and outcome. Using a discovery-validation study design, we
propose to identify metabolic biomarkers of radiation injury to three major organs at risk for delayed
complications: kidney, heart and brain (Specific Aim 1), and develop a kit-based assay along with a biomarker
scoring algorithm for assessing and predicting injury in these organs (Specific Aim 2). We will make use of our
established rat models of partial and total body irradiation to identify plasma and urine biomarkers that predict
the extent of injury in the kidney, heart and brain before clinical symptoms appear. For this purpose, we will
make use of male and female rats of an inbred and an outbred strain and expose rats to X-rays and a mixed
neutron/γ-ray beam. We will determine which matrix (plasma or urine) provides the best predictor for each of
the organ systems. We will validate rat biomarker panels in independent cohorts of rats and in banked samples
of non-human primates exposed to radiation. Biomarker panels will then be used to develop a prototype
metabolite kit in 96-well format and test its technical feasibility in accordance with good laboratory practice
guidelines. This prototype kit is required for the rapid future development of a field-deployable minimally
invasive biomarker assay that will identify individuals at risk. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to
delineate minimally invasive, high specificity classification algorithms for predicting delayed radiation injuries in
kidney, heart and brain with >90% specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value. While here we focus on
radiation late effects, the standard operating procedures, assay parameters and decision analysis software
developed in this study will serve as a foundation for broader based implementation of minimally invasive
biomarkers in radiation risk assessment."
10766833,"Project Summary/Abstract
Current drug discovery efforts for non-addictive, chronic pain management are targeting human voltage-gated
sodium (hNaV) channels: pore-forming transmembrane proteins that evoke the fast action potential in excitable
neuronal, cardiac, and skeletal cells. Genetic and preclinical target validation studies have identified hNaV1.7,
hNaV1.8, hNaV1.9 channel subtypes as key proteins in pain signaling with emphasis on hNaV1.7 for its
predominant expression in the peripheral nervous system. Attempts at selectively targeting hNaV1.7 with pre-
clinical small-molecule drugs fall short due to non-selective binding to other hNaV channel subtypes and other
ion channel families; non-selective binding can lead to cardiac arrest, paralysis and seizure. Peptide toxins
originating from tarantula, spider, and scorpion have been identified as potent hNaV-inhibiting biologics.
Notably, Protoxin-II, the neurotoxin from the Peruvian green velvet tarantula, has approximately 1 nM half-
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to hNav1.7. However, these peptide toxins also have non-selective
binding to hNav1.7. With recent cryo-EM structural images of Protoxin-II bound to voltage-sensing domain II of
hNaV1.7, it is now possible to design peptides mimicking Protoxin-II that are selective to hNaV1.7. Advances in
de novo protein design methods using Rosetta – a protein structure prediction and design software suite –
enable a new avenue of drug design and virtual screening prior to experimental validation. Thus, the project
aims to create new peptides inspired from Protoxin-II to selectively target hNaV1.7. The methodology designs
new peptide topologies that incorporate the Protoxin-II motif structurally shown to bind to hNaV1.7. The
peptides are further optimized to bind to residues unique to hNaV1.7: residues that are not targeted by natural
peptide toxins. Upon synthesis of candidate peptides, they will be validated to selectively target hNaV1.7 using
whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. The results will improve our mechanistic understanding needed for
selective, yet potent hNaV1.7 inhibition. Further, this research will be the first attempt at using a combination of
Rosetta de novo protein design methods to create unique peptides selective for hNaV1.7. The applicant upon
completion of this project will have a refined expertise of computational protein design methods and receive
training in electrophysiology for the first time. Throughout this project, the sponsor and co-sponsor will
implement a training plan to strengthen the applicant’s knowledge of neuroscience and drug discovery, while
broadening their collaborative network, and sharpening their scientific communication skills. This plan is
tailored such that the applicant is prepared for an academic career designing peptide biologics for the
treatment and investigation of ion channel pathologies."

mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome is indispensable for mitochondrial function because it encodes protein
subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system and a set of transfer and ribosomal RNAs. mtDNA degradation
is an essential mechanism in mitochondrial genomic maintenance and cell signaling. The knowledge regarding
the mechanism of mtDNA degradation remains limited, representing a significant knowledge gap. Such
knowledge is fundamental to the understanding of mitochondrial genomic maintenance and pathology because
mtDNA degradation may contribute to the etiology of mtDNA depletion syndromes and inflammatory and
immunological diseases triggered by cytosolic and cell-free mtDNA. The objective of this project is to delineate
the chemical and molecular basis of damaged mtDNA degradation by identifying the proteins factors and
molecular triggers in mtDNA degradation and characterizing the released mtDNA products. Addressing these
critical knowledge barriers will facilitate the PI’s long-term goal of unraveling the basis of mtDNA turnover and its
role in mitochondrial pathobiology. The application builds on the PI’s expertise in DNA and protein biochemistry,
mechanistic enzymology, and quantitative analysis, and accelerates the progress in an exciting, productive area
of research into mitochondrial biology. The proposed research is grounded in progress from the PI’s and other
laboratories in the field. Recent research from the PI’s laboratory has provided strong chemical, molecular, and
cellular evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in the degradation of
damaged mtDNA containing abasic (AP) sites. AP sites are ubiquitous DNA lesions and central DNA repair
intermediates. Enzymology studies from the PI’s laboratory have also provided insights into catalytic and kinetic
mechanisms of key proteins in mtDNA maintenance. The proposed research will focus on (i) identifying unknown
protein factors in mtDNA degradation using proteomics and siRNA-based approaches, (ii) clarifying the
molecular triggers of mtDNA degradation using biochemical and cellular assays, and (iii) characterizing the
chemical and molecular properties of fragmented mtDNA using mass spectrometry-based methods. The
expected outcome is that the results from this research will provide new insights into the molecular basis of
mtDNA degradation and shed light on the characteristics of subsequent mtDNA products. The project is
significant because it addresses a critical barrier in the field by providing fundamental knowledge at the molecular
level. In addition, the PI’s commitment to enhancing diversity in the biomedical workforce further the significance
at a minority- and Hispanic-serving institution. Considering the importance of mtDNA in cell signaling and innate
immunity, new insights into mtDNA degradation will not only advance the understanding of mtDNA biology and
unveil potential drug targets for manipulating mtDNA for therapeutic purposes, but have broad implications for
understanding the pathobiology of inflammatory and immunological diseases."

 The invention of new methods to access chiral organic molecules is a critical objective in modern organic
chemistry as it is essential for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutical agents. This is especially relevant as the
pharmaceutical industry is making efforts to increase the 3D complexity of drug candidates. Despite substantial
progress in the field of stereoselective chemical synthesis, many structures remain challenging to prepare in
useful quantities. Therefore, development of new methods and strategies for the chemical synthesis of
stereochemically and topologically complex molecules is of contemporary interest. The long-term goals of our
research program are to introduce general and efficient strategies for the stereoselective synthesis of difficult-
to-access molecular frameworks found in important bioactive molecules. Towards this end, we are interested in
the conversion of abundant and readily available alkenes to more complex structures through difunctionalization
reactions. This approach is attractive because the rapid buildup of complexity can be achieved as two new bonds
and two new stereocenters are generated in a single operation. The studies described in this application focus
on three distinct programs. The first is the development of stereoselective cross-coupling reactions of Csp3-
nucleophiles that are catalytically generated in situ from simple alkenes. Our rationale for development of these
reactions is that widely available alkenes, diboron reagents, and organohalides are converted to synthetically
versatile intermediates. We will develop new Pd/Cu-catalyzed and Ni-catalyzed systems with a particular
emphasis placed on saturated heterocycle synthesis. In addition, with the advent of new catalytic systems we
will engage Csp3-electrophiles for the generation of multiple stereogenic centers. In the second program of
research, we are developing methods for the stereoselective synthesis of cyclobutanes by [2+2] cycloadditions
of alkenes that are enabled by boron. Our rationale for the development of these reactions is that due to the
unique feature of boron, a broad range of borylated cyclobutanes can be prepared. Finally, we are introducing
new classes of novel building blocks to enable drug discovery, such as bicyclo[2.2.0]hexanes as isosteres for
meta-substituted aromatic rings. Within this program, we are also developing novel strain release reactions
initiated by energy transfer. Overall, these studies in reaction development will introduce new concepts and
strategies, as well as provide access to new building blocks for chemical synthesis by exploring new cross-
coupling paradigms and cycloaddition reactions."

This K01 award describes a 3-year training program to support Dr. Franca's transition to scientific
independence. Dr. Franca is a dentist-scientist, and her long-term goal is to lead a research program to (i)
develop immunomodulatory biomaterials for dental and craniofacial regeneration and (ii) to create tissue
chips to understand and treat oral diseases. The scientific goal of this K01 is to develop an
immunomodulatory scaffold for dental pulp regeneration. Despite undeniable progress to develop
regenerative strategies for the dental pulp, necrotic teeth present challenging conditions for regeneration.
Even after careful disinfection, a previously infected root canal's microenvironment has remnant
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that activates immune cells into a pro-inflammatory state incompatible with tissue
regeneration. Recently, early events of the immune response were shown to highly influence tissue
engineering strategies' success. Especially, macrophage responses to biomaterials have been identified as
essential mediators of scaffold remodeling and promising targets for immune-mediated regenerative
strategies. These cells can respond to external stimuli by changing their phenotype from pro-inflammatory to
pro-regenerative, with many intermediate states, in a process known as M1/M2 polarization. These two states
are highly plastic, function synergistically, and can be modulated by the scaffold's properties. When a scaffold
for dental pulp regeneration is placed in contact with LPS-contaminated dentin, it can be expected that M1
activation will persist without providing the pro-regenerative environment necessary for tissue formation.
Small antibodies or nanobodies have been used to neutralize LPS in Gram-negative infections and target
pathogens in scarcely accessible tissue microenvironments. Unfortunately, this therapeutic tool has not been
used for dental regeneration purposes. Our overarching hypothesis is that an immunomodulatory scaffold
that neutralizes LPS and increases the M2/M1 ratio in the scaffold-tissue interface will provide a sustainable
pro-regenerative microenvironment more favorable to dental pulp tissue formation. Hence, our goal is to
engineer a novel nanobody-laden photocrosslinkable hydrogel with fine-tuned stiffness and the ability to
neutralize dentin LPS. This scaffold will enable controllable guidance of M1 macrophages activation,
minimizing their presence within the root canal so that incoming monocytes can polarize into M2 cells,
infiltrate the hydrogel, and secret an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu to foster dental pulp tissue formation.
We propose the following aims: (Aim 1) to determine the effect of scaffold's stiffness on M1/M2 macrophage
polarization, (Aim 2) to neutralize dentin LPS and reduce M1 polarization, and (Aim 3) to evaluate the
nanobody-laden scaffold's immunomodulatory capacity in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will
generate data on the interplay between scaffold's properties and macrophage function, forming the basis for
an R01 submission and the development of additional novel immunomodulatory materials."
10767322,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors in adults and account for over 14,000 deaths
annually in the United States. Glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV glioma) is the most common and deadly glioma
subtype and is associated with a median overall survival of only ~15 months with aggressive therapy. Telomere
maintenance mechanisms are a hallmark of cancer and are required to enable replicative immortality of
malignant cells, including gliomas. To maintain telomeres, the majority of gliomas use the enzyme telomerase,
which uses an RNA template and reverse transcription to extend telomeric repeats at the ends of chromosomes.
In contrast, a subset of gliomas employs telomerase-independent mechanisms, termed Alternative Lengthening
of Telomeres (ALT). ALT uses homologous recombination to maintain telomere length and is characterized by
increased replicative stress in telomere regions and remodeling of telomeric chromatin architecture to an
epigenetic state that is permissive to homologous recombination. ~10% of GBM cases and virtually all
progressive grade II/III IDH-mutant astrocytomas harbor genetic alterations involved in the induction of ALT. In
addition to ATRX mutations, we recently identified recurrent loss-of-function mutations in the SMARCAL1
(SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like1) gene as novel
genetic mutations associated with the ALT phenotype in IDH-wildtype – TERT promoter wild-type GBM.
SMARCAL1 encodes an annealing helicase that localizes to sites of DNA damage and replication stress and
resolves stalled replication fork structures to facilitate fork progression within difficult-to-replicate DNA
sequences, such as telomeres. Recent studies indicate that SMARCAL1 localizes to telomeric DNA in ALT-
positive cancer cells with native ATRX-inactivating mutations and that SMARCAL1 helicase activity suppresses
markers of replication stress and DNA damage at telomeres. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
SMARCAL1 activity is essential for resolving replication stress at telomeric regions and SMARCAL1 loss-of-
function leads to an increase in unresolved replication fork collapse and DNA damage at telomeres in a manner
that is permissive to homologous recombination and ALT. In Aim 1 we will use genetically engineered cell lines
and cancer cell lines with native SMARCAL1 mutations to identify specific ALT pathway components required
for telomere synthesis and cellular immortalization in the context of SMARCAL1 loss-of-function mutations. In
Aim 2, we will use patient-derived glioma cell lines and xenografts to determine the extent to which SMARCAL1
helicase activity resolves replication stress at telomeres in ATRX-mutant GBM cell lines using ALT. Collectively,
the proposed studies are expected to significantly advance our understanding of the role of SMARCAL1 in GBM
telomere maintenance and are designed to establish proof of concept for therapeutic targeting of SMARCAL1 in
ALT-positive gliomas harboring ATRX mutations."

SNS failure is common in old age and neurodegenerative diseases that impair adaptation to common
physiological stressors. We and others found that sympathetic axons innervate skeletal muscle fibers and
maintain the integrity of skeletal muscle composition and function at the presynaptic and postsynaptic
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in health and disease. We also demonstrated that (a) SNS impairment leads to
skeletal muscle motor denervation; (b) both the SNS and sympathomimetics regulate motoneuron synaptic
vesicle release and postsynaptic molecular composition; and (c) aging blunts the influence of the SNS on NMJ
transmission. These data support the strong influence of the SNS on motoneuron and myofiber molecular
composition and function.
Probing deeper, we found that the SNS and sympathomimetics regulate motoneuron synaptic vesicle release
via extracellular Ca2+ and such molecular targets, as TRPV1 and P/Q- and N-type voltage-activated Ca2+
channels. Recently, we demonstrated that ?1-adrenoceptor is expressed in motoneurons and declines
significantly with aging. These studies unveil the molecular substrate that accounts for the influence of
peripheral sympathetic neurons on NMJ transmission in young mice and its decline with aging. However, we
do not know whether and how the central autonomic relays (CARs)—particularly the pontine A5 nucleus, which
projects to the spinal cord intermediolateral (IML) column—regulate skeletal muscle mass, strength,
innervation, and NMJ transmission and whether this influence declines over time. Optogenetics combined with
neuron retrograde labeling provides a unique opportunity to determine the precise role of A5 nucleus in living
mice.
Based on our published and preliminary data, we propose that aging impairs A5 nucleus regulation of
the peripheral SNS, increasing skeletal muscle sympathetic and motor denervation and loss of mass
and strength.
The following specific aims are designed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1 define the role of A5 sympathetic
neurons projecting to hindlimb muscles (SNPHLM) in muscle motoneuron denervation, impaired NMJ
transmission, and sarcopenia with aging, and Aim 2 will determine whether sustained expression of the master
sympathetic transcription factor Phox-2b in A5 SNPHLM attenuates skeletal muscle sympathetic and motor
denervation with aging.
This project will be the first to define CARs’ role in NMJ transmission and muscle sympathetic and motor
innervation. It will elucidate upper level control of the motor unit to achieve an integrated, comprehensive
understanding of aging sarcopenia. Successful results will shift the treatment target for sarcopenia from the
skeletal muscle to the central sympathetic neuron."

compared with non-Hispanic White women (14% vs 9%). Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal
morbidity among Black infants. Pregnant Black women are also more likely to experience racial discrimination
and depressive symptoms and have higher risk for vitamin D deficiency [plasma 25(OH)D concentration <20
ng/ml] compared with White women. Racial discrimination, depressive symptoms and vitamin D deficiency
have been associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,TNF-α, IL-6), but research has not
examined the gene expression of immune-related genes as potential pathways of these factors with PTB.
Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) contain lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells all of which are
important for immune function and can express both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. By examining the
gene expression pattern of PBMCs in a cohort of Black pregnant women, it could elucidate distinct or
overlapping pathways by which psychosocial factors (e.g. racial discrimination, depressive symptoms) and
vitamin D status increase risk for PTB.
 Using data from 168 pregnant Black women participating in Dr. Giurgescu's (mentor) R01 study, I will
examine the associations among racial discrimination, depressive symptoms, Vitamin D Binding Protein
(VDBP) genotype, plasma 25(OH)D concentration, gene expression of immune cell genes, systemic
inflammation, and gestational age (GA) at birth. Women completed questionnaires and had blood drawn at 8-
18 weeks gestation. Questionnaire data, plasma cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, INF-γ) levels, and GA
at birth will be available from the parent study. Frozen plasma and PBMC samples are stored in mentor's
laboratory. Plasma 25(OH)D concentration will be measured from frozen samples using liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry. VDBP genotype will be assessed by TaqMan assays using DNA extracted from nuclei
isolated from PBMCs. Under the supervision of Dr. Kraus (co-mentor), I will conduct bulk RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) on frozen PBMCs. I aim to: (Aim 1) Explore differential gene expression of immune cell genes
between (1) women with PTB and women with term birth; and (2) women with vitamin D deficiency and women
with vitamin D sufficiency; and (Aim 2) Examine the pathways by which racial discrimination, depressive
symptoms, plasma 25(OH)D, VDBP genotype, differentially expressed genes (identified in Aim 1), and
systemic inflammation relate to GA at birth. The proposed, rigorous training plan and highly experienced
mentorship team will accelerate my path to independent investigator, allowing me time to learn cutting-edge
research using genomics and transcriptomics, develop competency in analysis and bioinformatics of omics
data, and gain team leadership skills. The results from this study will provide the preliminary data for a NIH
R01 study to identify predictive biomarkers for PTB."

Schiaffino received her PhD in Health Services Research in 2014 and MPH in Epidemiology in 2008. As a
health disparities systems scientist, Dr. Schiaffino’s goals are to identify organizational and provider-level risk
factors that affect how care is delivered to diverse older adults undergoing treatment for cancer to improve sub-
optimal care delivery and treatment outcomes. Older, specifically minority, adults are at greater risk due to the
higher symptom burden and treatment-related toxicity risk of cancer therapy. The proposal entitled, Improving
age-related risk assessment and documentation in diverse older adults diagnosed with cancer, seeks to
examine provider and documentation barriers that result in sub-optimal assessment of age-related risk. Age-
related risk assessments are a series of evidence based clinical tests and screening that can improve cancer
treatment planning for older adults, it is especially salient for older adults experiencing language barriers.
There is currently insufficient research on the mechanisms contributing to sub-optimal assessment and
documentation of age-related risk in radiation oncology. While evidence supports improved communication and
cancer outcomes for patients when age-related risk is assessed, recent clinical trial findings show that only 1 in
4 providers are implementing this assessment in routine practice. Effective assessments are even less
common in older adults with English language barriers. Understanding organizational and provider-level
perspectives on assessment and documentation practices using electronic health records (EHRs), and
qualitatively interviewing and observing oncologists, will help inform future clinic workflow redesign. The
proposed career development and training plan supports Dr. Schiaffino’s trajectory toward becoming an
independent, aging-systems scientist through the following three goals: 1) Obtain advanced natural
language processing (NLP) algorithm development training to extract unstructured text from EHRs, 2)
Engage in observation and training in geriatric oncology care delivery, to understand clinical workflow
and clinical practices around assessment of age-related risk, and 3) Gain experience in clinical workflow
implementation science proposal development. This project will take place at SDSU, UCSD, and City of
Hope (Duarte, CA) with mentors who are experts in Geriatrics/Gerontology (Primary: Alison Moore, MD, MS);
Radiation Oncology/HSR (Co- Primary: James Murphy, MD, MS, UCSD); Geriatric Oncology/ Decision-Making

10767508,"Project Summary/Abstract—Overall Program
Genetic testing for both germline and somatic mutations has improved our understanding of the basic biology of
carcinogenesis, identified high-risk populations for targeted prevention and screening, identified targets for new
treatment strategies, and has led to some of the most significant inroads in reducing cancer burden. Yet, there
is still much to learn about the role of inherited genetic susceptibility and cancer, and the significant barriers to
accessing genetic counseling and testing services, particularly in under-represented populations. We have
assembled one of the largest populations of African American cancer survivors to date to study genetic
susceptibility in this population. The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) (U01CA199240) cohort
includes participants considered to be at particularly high-risk due to family history of cancer, age at diagnosis
or a diagnosis of a second primary cancer, and the infrastructure will be used to expand participation. The
Program includes three projects and two cores with an overall goal of improving the identification and
clinical management of hereditary and multiple primary cancers in African Americans, who are currently
underrepresented in genetic research. To do this we will: 1) Use bioinformatic analyses, family structure, gene
expression, and somatic alterations to identify African American cancer survivors most likely to harbor high-
penetrance genetic variants currently classified as pathogenic or having uncertain significance; 2) Characterize
the spectrum of germline genetic variation in African Americans with multiple primary cancers in relation to known
pathogenic mutations, site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS), and largely modifiable non-genetic risk factors;
and 3) Develop an online, culturally adapted educational intervention to increase access to genetic counseling
information among medically underserved African Americans and uptake of risk-appropriate genetic testing
among those at increased risk so that we are poised to translate novel genetic discoveries into clinical practice."
10767509,"Project Summary
Understanding the spectrum of germline mutations underlying hereditary cancers has clear clinical implications,
and while mutations in at least four dozen genes have been associated with heritable cancers, the prevalence,
characteristics, and clinical implications of most of these genes have not been well described in African
Americans (AAs). Due to the lack of racial diversity in genetic databases, we and others have shown that AAs
have been shown to harbor a disproportionate number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) compared to
whites. A VUS result has the potential to not only increase psychological burden but also exclude African
Americans from gene-specific cancer treatments and prevention interventions, further exacerbating existing
racial disparities in cancer incidence and survival. VUS reclassification is a time- and labor-intensive process.
The international efforts for VUS reclassification include aggregation of epidemiological and family data, as well
as evaluation of functional data applying molecular biology techniques to in vitro and in vivo systems.
Unfortunately, the variants most likely to be examined are those seen most frequently in populations of European
ancestry and there is limited throughput for evaluating the thousands of VUS that have been identified to date.
The overall goal of the study is to develop and implement an integrative approach for re-classifying VUS and
identifying novel pathogenic variants through targeted germline sequencing, familial segregation analyses, and
somatic mutation profiling of tumors. The specific aims of the project are to (1) quantify the prevalence of
pathogenic variants and VUS in AAs with breast, prostate, colorectal, endometrial, and other young onset
cancers in metropolitan Detroit, (2) characterize segregation patterns of VUS in these genes among family
members and evaluate in silico and RNA-based predictions of pathogenicity of these VUS, and (3) develop a
tumor expression- and somatic mutation-based classifier to predict breast and colorectal tumors with PVs versus
non-PVs in a DNA repair gene (homologous recombination or mismatch repair) to be used for VUS
reclassification. This approach represents a powerful tool for characterizing the clinical implications of VUS in
cancer susceptibility genes using population science approaches. We will leverage data and biospecimens from
the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (Detroit ROCS) cohort, a population-based study of AAs with cancer
within the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS) registry catchment area. This study is
impactful as it will as it will result in a robust approach for identifying clinically actionable variants among African
American families affected with cancer."

Over the past ten years, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been commercialized as a “less harmful”
alternative to traditional cigarettes. Preclinical models show that e-cigarettes cause pulmonary epithelial,
endothelial, and vascular dysfunction similar to human COPD. E-cigarette use has also been associated with
cardiac and pulmonary diseases, including severe respiratory failure. However, we still do not clearly understand
how e-cigarette uses impacts lung health in the early days of use. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish
the health impact of e-cigarettes on human lungs. Conventional diagnostic tools such as pulmonary function
tests (PFT) and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) are limited in detecting subtle but potentially
significant early pathologies from e-cigarette use. To address this shortcoming, we propose to use 3D
hyperpolarized xenon-129 MRI (HXeMRI) as a new imaging biomarker. Our group has optimized the HXeMRI
technique to quantify the regional physiology of pulmonary microcompartments (airway, interstitial tissues, and
capillary vasculature) with high resolution and sensitivity. Our HXeMRI pilot study demonstrated that healthy
young e-cigarette users with normal PFT had dysregulated gas exchange in the interstitial tissue and pulmonary
capillary compartments compared to age-matched controls. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize
that quantitative HXeMRI signatures can detect clinically relevant early physiologic changes in the lungs of
healthy young e-cigarette users. We speculate that a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) will exacerbate
these dysregulated lung functions and limit healthy young e-cigarette users’ exercise capacity by reducing their
oxygen uptake. Therefore, we hypothesize that the CPET, a clinical diagnostic standard, will corroborate
HXeMRI signatures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time any non-invasive technique has revealed
dysfunctional gas exchange capacity in healthy young e-cigarette users with normal PFT. Our two aims are: (1).
Aim 1: Determine the impact of e-cigarette use on pulmonary gas exchange capacity in interstitial tissues and
capillaries using HXeMRI, and corroborate the HXeMRI signatures with the CPET for 40 young adults with e-
cigarette use at an initial visit (V1) and a follow-up visit 12-months later (V2), compared to 40 age-matched
healthy control subjects without e-cigarette use as controls; and (2). Aim 2: Determine the acute effects of e-
cigarettes on pulmonary gas exchange capacity in interstitial tissues and capillaries among the e-cigarette users
from Aim 1 by HXeMRI at baseline and after being perturbed by a dose of e-cigarettes during the V1 and V2
evaluations. The result of our proposal is anticipated to yield a comprehensive understanding of the health impact
of e-cigarette use and bring forth gas exchange signatures of HXeMRI as a new diagnostic tool to assess these
patients."
10779359,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
T cell-B cell interactions that result in B cell maturation and antibody production were once thought to occur
exclusively in lymphoid organs. It is now appreciated that T peripheral helper (Tph) cells provide excessive
help to B cells resulting in autoantibody production in inflamed peripheral tissues. Such disordered Tph cell-B
cell responses have been implicated in some forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis in both adults and children.
The pathways that regulate the Tph cell-B cell axis in non-lymphoid tissues are not understood.
By studying joint fluid from patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), we found evidence of dysregulated
Tph cell-B cell responses in children with early-onset and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive forms of the
disease. Our preliminary studies also identified a novel T cell subset, T peripheral regulatory (Tpr) cells, in
the joints of patients with JIA. These Tpr cells co-express regulatory T (Treg) and B cell-helper T cell factors.
Further, Tpr cells have the ability to inhibit Tph cell-B cell interactions that result in plasmablast generation in
our T cell-B cell co-culture system. The central hypothesis of this application is that Tpr cells restrain Tph cell-B
cell interactions in the joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis.
The central hypothesis in this research proposal will be tested with two Specific Aims that will be conducted
with biosamples (peripheral blood, synovial fluid, tonsil tissue) from children with JIA as well as healthy
controls. Through our established T cell-B cell co-culture system, Aim1 will assess the mechanisms by which
Tpr cells regulate Tph cell-B cell interactions. We will test the hypothesis that Tpr cells are uniquely equipped
to inhibit proliferation and cytokine production in B cell-helper T cells as well as antibody production, class
switching, and maturation in B cells by inducing alterations in gene expression and metabolism. Using a
multiomics approach coupled with functional assays, Aim 2 will define the developmental pathways and
transcriptional program required for Tpr functionality. We will test the hypothesis that Tpr cells differentiate from
Treg cells in the joint and have a unique transcriptional program that is distinct from other Treg subsets and
ensures Tpr functionality in tissues.
The research is innovative because we will use a systems immunology approach coupled with synovial fluid
samples from children with JIA to study T cell-B cell responses directly from affected tissues. Completion of
this research will be significant because Tpr cells represent a novel regulatory pathway with the capacity to
restrain Tph cell-B cell responses and ameliorate tissue-specific inflammation in arthritis and other autoimmune
diseases."

Molecular motors are essential for cellular organization, and drive cell-type specific architectures. Motors
distribute organelles, mRNA, and other cellular components to the correct place, at the proper time, and
regulate multiple pathways including secretion, and intracellular traffic. Thus, the proper control of molecular
motors is essential for animal physiology.
 Myosin V motors (MyoV) are present in most eukaryotes and provide relatively long-range movement of
cargoes on actin cables. Humans express three MyoV. Mutations in each MyoV have been linked to serious
diseases. In many cases, the defects may be due to an inability of the MyoV to properly associate with cargo.
We uncovered some of the mechanisms required for cargo attachment and detachment from MyoV. However,
there are large gaps in knowledge of how cargo attachment and detachment from MyoV is controlled.
 In S. cerevisiae (hereafter referred to as yeast), long-range transport of many cargoes occurs solely on
actin via MyoV. This contrasts with most organisms, where transport initiates on microtubules via kinesins with
a subsequent handoff to MyoV. Thus, regulation of yeast MyoV, Myo2, is a simpler system.
 Strikingly, selected cargoes of yeast Myo2 have distinct trajectories. This led to our discovery that
disengagement of Myo2 from its cargoes is a key property of organelle transport. Importantly, due to their
sequence similarity, mechanisms discovered for yeast Myo2 have provided insights into human MyoV function.
 This proposal is focused on vacuole/lysosome inheritance which occurs via Myo2 and is controlled both
spatially and temporally. We identified the Vac17-Vac8 vacuole adaptors, yet how Myo2 interacts with Vac17-
Vac8 and the mechanisms(s) that regulate formation and disassociation of the complex are poorly understood.
Our recent inroads in biochemical and genetic analyses have led to the following two aims.
 1) Determine the organization of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. This aim will use genetics, biochemistry,
structural approaches and AlphaFold multimer predictions to determine how Vac17 associates with Myo2 and
with the scaffold protein Vac8. 2) Determine roles of Vps41 and the kinase Yck3 in the regulated disassembly
of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. We discovered that Vps41 and Yck3 are critical for disruption of the Myo2-
Vac17-Vac8 complex, yet their roles in this pathway are distinct from their known roles in vacuole fusion. To
determine their Myo2-specific roles, we will identify additional proteins that act with Vps41 and Yck3 in the
context of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. We will use pull-down approaches, high-content microscopy
screens and proximity labeling. Given that little is known about how molecular motors attach or detach from
cargoes, the proposed studies will likely reveal new pathways that are crucial for cell function."

 The human gene DNMT3A encodes one of the three enzymes that carry out DNA methylation in
humans. Clonal expansion of blood cells with acquired mutations in DNMT3A is common in older adults,
occurring in 5-10 % of healthy individuals aged 60 or above. Carriers of DNMT3A mutations have an
approximately tenfold increased risk of developing hematologic cancers and are twice as likely to develop
coronary heart disease. Given the rapidly aging population in the United States and worldwide, understanding
the mechanistic basis of the association between acquired DNMT3A mutations in blood cells and increased
susceptibility to cancer and cardiovascular disease is tremendously important for public health. Recent studies
found evidence of increased inflammation mediated by myeloid cells when the ortholog of DNMT3A was
perturbed in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and whether
DNMT3A mutations affect the inflammatory response of human myeloid cells remain poorly understood. To
address this gap in knowledge, we established an experimental system based on myeloid cells differentiated
from human pluripotent stem cells. Using this system, we found that human macrophages with DNMT3A
mutations displayed altered inflammatory response compared to wild-type macrophages, characterized by
augmented expression of IL-6, a potent proinflammatory cytokine. The IL6 promoter was one of the most
significantly hypomethylated loci in DNMT3A-mutated macrophages, suggesting a direct mechanistic link
between DNA methylation and inflammatory response in our model. In this application, we propose to
characterize the molecular signature of the inflammatory response associated with DNMT3A mutations using
genetically defined human macrophages and neutrophils and to dissect the epigenetic mechanisms underlying
DNMT3A-mediated gene expression regulation. In addition, we will examine the impact of harboring clonally
expanded blood cells with DNMT3A mutations on the inflammatory response of primary myeloid cells using a
novel single-cell transcriptomic technique. We are in an ideal position to pursue this project given the
availability of human pluripotent stem cell-based human myeloid cell models that we have developed and
validated, our access to a large biobank representing extremely diverse populations, and the assembly of a
strong scientific team consisting of investigators with complementary expertise. Findings from the proposed
study will provide critical new insights into the consequence of acquiring DNMT3A mutations on inflammation,
and help us develop novel strategies to prevent and treat pathologic conditions related to DNMT3A mutations."

Subtle Medical, Inc. (Subtle), in collaboration with the University of Washington, proposes a Fast-Track project
to develop and validate a software product capable of enhancing an entire brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) study. The proposed system will use state-of-the-art machine learning methods to build a product that
integrates seamlessly into the Radiology workﬂow and standard patient care path to determine if any
required MRI acquisitions are missing or corrupted, then correct the corrupted acquisitions and synthesize the
missing acquisitions by incorporating the information contained in the appropriately acquired acquisitions.
Brain studies make up approximately 20% of all MRI studies worldwide, and nearly all brain studies acquire
multiple image contrasts to obtain complementary information. It has been reported that nearly 60% of all
MRI acquisitions contain at least minimal motion artifacts. Moreover, important acquisitions are frequently
skipped or forgotten during the study. The result is that a signiﬁcant fraction of brain MRI studies are sent to
radiologists with missing or poor-quality exam sequences that can reduce the quality of care while increasing
the burden on the radiologist to read a suboptimal study. A successful completion of this project will result in
a tool for imaging centers that will improve the consistency and quality of brain MRI studies and allow them
to increase their throughput by removing the need to rescan acquisitions with artifacts. This will improve the
experience and care of the patients while reducing the burden on radiologists and improving the eﬀiciency of
the imaging center’s operations."
10874571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a childhood liver cancer with a high case mortality rate. Patients with FLC
typically present with advanced disease, as there are no early warning signs. Thus, a cure by surgical resection
is rarely attainable. In addition, FLCs are notoriously resistant to chemotherapies and other targeted therapies
currently approved for liver cancer, leading to a 5-year survival of just 30%. New therapeutic strategies that
counteract the molecular signaling events that go awry in FLC are urgently needed. FLC is characterized by a
fusion event resulting in a novel chimeric protein that joins the N-terminal domain of DNAJ with the catalytic
subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) in hepatocytes. However, the underlying mechanism by which DNAJ-PKAc
drives FLC tumor growth remains unknown.
This project's overall goal is to apply an unbiased systems-based
approach to identify and validate druggable signaling networks that regulate the growth of DNAJ-PKAc-
expressing FLC cells and uncover a mechanistic understanding of how DNAJ-PKAc chimeric protein drives FLC.
The paucity of preclinical models such as immortalized primary human FLC cell lines has precluded many
investigators. Our lab has established three new model systems to address this significant gap: patient-derived
cell lines bearing the FLC gene fusion, organotypic cultures, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice. Utilizing
these model systems, we carried out a systems-pharmacology-based functional kinase inhibitor screening in
FLC cells and normal hepatocytes. We identified and confirmed the role of PLK1 kinases as essential for the
growth of FLC cells. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of PLK1 selectively reduces the growth of
multiple patient-derived FLC cell lines and the viability of FLC organotypic tissue slices. Further, treatment of the
FLC tumor with PLK1 inhibitor significantly reduced the tumor growth in the PDX model. PLK kinases are key
regulators of centrosome maturation and mitosis. Follow-up experiments suggest that DNAJ-PKAc chimera
localizes to the centrosomes where it physically interacts with PLK1.Thus, we hypothesize that the heightened
sensitivity of the FLC cells to PLK inhibition stems from the localization of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein to the
centrosome, its association with the PLK1 complex, thereby enhancing the activation of PLK1 and promoting
mitotic progression. We propose to 1. uncover molecular mechanisms of how DNAJ-PKAc fusion alters PLK1
activation and function, and 2. evaluate the efficacy of clinical-grade PLK1 inhibitors alone and in combination
with chemotherapy in preclinical models.Functional analyses will highlight the mechanistic insights by which
DNAJ-PKAc drives FLC tumor progression and the role of the PLK1 signaling complex in FLC survival, thus
deepening our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Our cross-disciplinary team consisting of Drs. Gujral,
Scott, and Yeung represent a cohesive collaboration that brings systems biology, PKA biochemistry, and state-
of-art human-derived FLC cancer models to address this deadly disease. Our findings have translational
significance as they will provide a rationale for targeting critical signaling nodes that sustain FLC tumors' survival."

 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a highly manageable infection when treated with combination
anti-retroviral therapy (cART). However, it is not yet curable and people living with HIV (PLWH) taking
cART suffer from suboptimal immune health and reduced quality of life long-term. A leading cause of
ongoing health concerns is persistent, residual infection. Persistently infected T-cells of PLWH that take
cART still produce viral RNA and proteins, as well as defective proviruses, that can chronically activate
the immune system despite undetectable viral loads. A better understanding of the biology and
metabolism of HIV RNA and gene expression in PLWH taking cART could unlock additional therapeutic
strategies to reduce viral gene products and improve quality of life.
 Cellular RNA and viral RNA can be subjected to a variety of post-transcriptional chemical
modifications. These modifications modulate or fine-tune molecular interactions and thereby control gene
expression and function through RNA processing, turnover, localization, or translation. Covalent base
modification and its effects on RNA regulation at a broad level beyond the four canonical bases is often
termed epitranscriptomics. The intimate relationship between RNA modification and RNA metabolism is
becoming better appreciated. However, manipulating this process for therapeutic treatment of HIV and
persistent infection in PLWH taking cART requires a deeper understanding of HIV epitranscriptomics.
 Here we propose systematic characterization and manipulation of HIV-1 RNA transcripts in model and
patient T-cells. In the R61 phase, we will utilize three powerful sequencing methodologies (total RNA-seq,
ribosome profiling, and nanopore direct RNA sequencing) to globally characterize the abundance,
processing, translation, and modification status of both viral and host RNA in T-cells during cART. These
experiments will include selection of persistently infected T-cells from PLWH taking cART. We will target
several known modifications via enzyme knockouts and nanopore sequencing. These experiments will
characterize HIV-1 RNA chemical modifications of potential significance and identify those with high a
likelihood of impacting HIV RNA and protein loads in T-cells.
 In the R33 phase, we will use chemically modified oligonucleotides to alter modifications of high
interest by blocking or directing site-specific modification. This will include oligonucleotides that sterically
block modification or guide new modification, both therapeutic modalities that are maturing rapidly.
Chemically modified oligonucleotides will provide a proof-of-concept for epiptranscriptome manipulation
as a potential therapeutic approach while offering nucleic acid therapeutic candidates."

Excessive dietary sodium consumption is ubiquitous in the United States and is a large contributor to
hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This is especially problematic for Black adults, who are known to have
high rates of salt-sensitive hypertension. Although the mechanisms underlying salt-sensitive hypertension are
poorly understood in humans, rodent studies document a neurohumoral component. Rodent studies have
identified specialized sodium chloride (NaCl)-sensing neurons in the circumventricular organs (CVOs) in the
brain (which lack a complete blood brain barrier (BBB)), that mediate NaCl-induced changes in sympathetic
nerve activity (SNA), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and regulation of blood pressure (BP). Recent data suggests
Na+-K+-2Cl- co-transporter (NKCC2) is not kidney specific but is in fact expressed in brain regions that regulate
whole body NaCl and water homeostasis. Interestingly, Black adults have greater basal level NKCC2 renal
activity, but it is unknown if these differences are present in sodium sensing areas of the brain. The objective of
this F32 is to determine if NKCC2 contributes toward NaCl-sensitivity in a population that is more prone to salt-
sensitive hypertension, Black adults. We seek to translate the prior rodent findings to humans by assessing
neuronal activation (using blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, BOLD fMRI)
as well as SNA, AVP, and BP during an acute hypernatremic stimulus, with and without an NKCC2 antagonist.
This will enable us to isolate the role of NKCC2 in NaCl sensitivity in Black and White adults. The overall
hypothesis is that Black adults have increased central sodium sensing and neurohumoral BP responses due to
greater NKCC2 activity in the brain. Accordingly, the first specific aim is to determine if NKCC2 contributes to
the differences observed in the neurohumoral regulation of blood pressure to acute hypernatremia between
Black and White adults. We hypothesize that the NKCC2 antagonist furosemide will attenuate the increase in
SNA, AVP, and BP during hypertonic saline infusion more in Black compared to White adults. The second
specific aim is to determine if there are differences in sodium sensing areas in the brain that are influenced by
NKCC2 between Black and White adults. We hypothesize that furosemide will attenuate the increase in BOLD
fMRI signal during hypertonic saline infusion more in Black compared to White adults. This comprehensive
assessment of sodium sensing and neurohumoral regulation of BP in response to hypertonic saline infusion,
with and without a NKCC2 antagonist, will provide novel information on the mechanisms contributing to salt-
sensitive BP. Understanding the central origins of sodium sensing and salt-sensitivity may lead to novel
therapeutic approaches to combat hypertension, a costly public health problem. Innovative and translational
approaches such as those employed in this proposal are needed to advance the field."

Older adults with cancer (OACs) comprise a large and growing proportion of cancer patients and survivors.
Many OACs have unmet behavioral health needs with significant negative implications for their quality of life,
physical health, and adherence to and recovery from cancer care. Efficacious interventions to address these
needs have been developed but their implementation into cancer care is limited. Dissemination and
implementation (D&I) research can address this gap by creating implementable interventions and identifying
strategies for integrating these interventions into routine cancer care. Available D&I research infrastructure is
limited by a lack of tailoring to population and project-specific needs, a focus on trainees and early career
faculty, and insufficient resources to meet current demand. The proposed project addresses these limitations
by developing new interdisciplinary research infrastructure, the Center for Implementation Research in Cancer
in Later Life (CIRCL) that will infuse D&I research methods into new and existing projects across all stages of
behavioral intervention development for OACs. CIRCL will consist of Administrative, Training, and Research
Cores. The Administrative Core will provide expert leadership, support, and oversight to ensure that the
mission and aims of CIRCL are accomplished. The Core will consist of an Executive Committee,
administrative Support Team, external Advisory Council, and OAC and Caregiver Council. The Training Core
will provide resources and networking opportunities to train investigators to integrate D&I science methods into
their research including a webinar series, work-in-progress webinar, mentorship program, and resource library.
The purpose of the Research Core is to evaluate the research needs of investigators and provide resources to
facilitate research on the D&I of behavioral interventions for OACs. The Core will administer a national
research needs assessment to inform the structure and content of CIRCL resources and will support a pilot
awards program and annual research conference. The overall project objectives will be met across two
phases. During the R21 phase (years 1-2), core components of CIRCL will be developed including hiring
administrative staff, launching the CIRCL website, establishing the Advisory and OAC and Caregiver Councils,
administering the research needs assessment, and developing standard operating procedures for all CIRCL
activities. During the R33 phase (years 3-5), we will utilize this established infrastructure to train researchers
and support D&I research projects. The resources available through CIRCL will be advertised nationally with
targeted outreach to investigators in underrepresented groups to increase diversity in the research workforce.
Benchmark evaluation during the R21 phase will ensure CIRCL resources are developed in a timely manner in
preparation for the R33 phase. Evaluation of the R33 phase will assess utilization of CIRCL resources and the
impact of those resources on the advancement of D&I research on behavioral interventions for OACs."
10810829,"Thin filament-linked actin-binding proteins, troponin and tropomyosin, control actomyosin-based muscle
contraction in cardiac and skeletal muscles. To elucidate mechanisms of muscle thin filament function at a
fundamental molecular level, it is crucial to determine the changing structural interactions of these regulatory
proteins that control muscle cooperative activation and relaxation via allosteric communication pathways between
filament components. It follows that disease-related myofibrillar protein mutants can perturb muscle on-off
switching by causing an imbalance in troponin-tropomyosin interactions on actin which, in turn, destabilizes relaxed
or active states and the transitions between them. It is our premise that early stage intervention to correct such
imbalances is paramount in diminishing or reversing resulting inexorable disease progression. In the current work,
we will address these imbalances by taking a multifaceted structural approach to elucidate the mechanism of thin
filament regulation and thus establish root causes of these perturbations. To accomplish this goal: 1. We will use
cryo-electron microscopy, coupled with 3D-image reconstruction, to establish regulatory transitions of troponin and
tropomyosin as well as test the impact of myosin-binding on thin filament actin and tropomyosin. 2. We will refine
this experimental approach with computational tools that we have pioneered to bring cryo-EM structures even
closer to an atomic level using protein-protein docking protocols and molecular dynamics. 3. We will compare
structural interactions that occur in normal thin filaments with those in filaments containing mutant proteins linked
to myopathies in order to assess how mutation-linked aberrant physiology can link to myopathology, while
localizing druggable target pockets at protein-protein interfaces. To achieve our aims, (1) we will focus on
identifying structural domains at the interface between of troponin subunit-T and actin-tropomyosin (Specific Aim
1); (2) we will reveal the structural mechanism used by regulatory domains of troponin subunit-I to trap tropomyosin
in its relaxed-state position on actin (Specific Aim 2); (3) we will determine the impact of myosin structural
interactions on actin-tropomyosin, less recognized but significant effectors of thin filament regulation (Specific Aim
3). The influence of myopathic-linked mutations in troponin, tropomyosin, actin and myosin will not only be predicted
and tested structurally but assayed functionally by measuring in vitro motility and contractility in engineered heart
tissue. Aiming to develop tools to counteract regulatory imbalances, we collaborate with associates at the Boston
University Central for Molecular Discovery to identify small molecules to be trapped at druggable interfaces along
thin filaments in order to potentially manipulate cooperative, regulatory pathways. Thus, our work on the molecular
regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle thin filaments and muscle contraction lies at the intersection of basic and
translation biomedical research. Here, our overarching goal is to couple understanding of atomic level mutational
“insults” that alter muscle control mechanisms to prospects of reversing early-stage defects in physiological function."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a spectrum of liver abnormalities from the relatively benign
storage of excess fat in nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to the more ominous nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
characterized by hepatocellular injury, necroinflammation, and fibrosis. Liver damage in NASH is the fastest
growing cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and is now the most common reason for liver transplantation in
women. The prevalence of NAFLD parallels that of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and
patients with these comorbidities are at greater risk of life-threatening liver outcomes. However, there are no
approved treatments for NAFLD and there is an urgent need for new strategies to suppress this emerging epi-
demic. Our goal is to employ innovative and highly integrative approaches in human subjects to gain mechanistic
insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD that will foster the development of new therapeutics that address the
underlying pathological processes. Early in the course of NAFL, hepatic lipid delivery is increased as a conse-
quence of high fat diets, adipose tissue insulin resistance and increased uptake and de novo synthesis of lipids.
This metabolic milieu increases mitochondrial density, oxidative capacity and TCA cycle flux in NAFL livers,
which eventually may overwhelm antioxidant defense mechanisms to promote the development of NASH. In
preclinical studies we observed that the insulin sensitizer and PPARγ agonist pioglitazone directly suppressed
elevated hepatic mitochondrial oxidative capacity and TCA cycle activity in these NAFL livers. Therefore, in the
following three specific aims we will utilize stable isotope tracer methodology to test the central hypothesis that
hepatic mitochondrial function is a targetable feature of NAFLD in humans. In Specific Aim 1 we will first quanti-
tate hepatic mitochondrial fluxes across the NAFLD spectrum using a triple stable isotope tracer approach ([U-
13C]propionate, [3,4-13C2]glucose and 2H2O) coupled to 2H and 13C NMR analysis to simultaneously interrogate
hepatic glucose metabolism and mitochondrial fluxes in well characterized patients with NAFL and NASH. Next,
in Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate hepatic mitochondrial function as a target of insulin sensitizers in humans and
will interrogate the contribution of peripheral PPARy agonism on hepatic mitochondrial fluxes and glucose me-
tabolism in NAFLD. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will determine the mitochondrial mechanisms governing the
effect of pioglitazone on NAFLD: In mice with NAFLD using a combination of single-nuclei genomics and shotgun
lipidomics approaches to examine parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell transcriptomics and to quantitate mi-
tochondrial lipid remodeling, respectively, in liver biopsies obtained following chronic pioglitazone treatment.
Collectively, these studies will identify mechanisms that can be exploited in the future to foster the design of
novel therapies that safely target T2D and NAFLD."

and translational researchers to understand and address the epigenetic dysregulation that underlies many
diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and ALS. The large data
sets generated by the new epigenomic assays can be integrated with data from single cell methods and
larger data sets describing disease states. These data sets are valuable because therapies for cancer and
neurodegenerative diseases are shifting from broad-brush approaches that have failed to meet
expectations due to patient heterogeneity. More targeted treatments for likely responders creates demand
for data that is presented in a form that informs disease mechanisms. Cell’s networks, phenotypic and
functional state is jointly regulated at multiple levels involving genome, epigenome, transcriptome,
proteome, and metabolome. Assessment of one modality at a time provides an incomplete representation
of cellular identity and is inadequate to understand biological systems and their underlying regulatory
mechanisms. There are no spatial epigenomics assays except for the one offered by AtlasXomics. This is
the first product to be developed from the Deterministic Barcoding in Tissue for spatial omics sequencing
(DBiT-seq) platform. The hypothesis is that the technology developed in an academic lab for co-profiling
can be transferred to other labs using the Company’s new chip designs that are easier to use. Reductions
in exposure to dust and required cleaning time by 90% should facilitate the democratized use of the assay.
The Company already has established a data portal with interactive visualization tools and website for
reviewers to access the processed data generated by DBiT-seq experiments from collaborators and
customers. Raw and processed data generated by this STTR will be made available through the data
portal tor reviewers (before publication) and the public to access data generated by this STTR (after
publication). Twenty investigators will be offered the opportunity to use the new software tools for co-
profiling service and to explore the curated data sets and provide feedback with a user satisfaction survey
(Likert scale) to assess the analysis and viewing of epigenome and transcriptome data. In Phase II, we aim
at launching commercial kits to existing customers of the single modality assay and to new customers.
These new products will enable dual and eventually tri-omic same-section spatial co-profiling
(transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome)."

GneX12 is a patented therapeutic vaccine in development specifically for women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(gonorrhea) infection. It is a novel formulation of recombinant human interleukin-12 (IL-12) encapsulated in
biodegradable sustained release micro-particles. It is meant to be given in conjunction with standard of care
antibiotics to turn infections into live vaccines that generate protective immunity against re-infection. It is also an
immune therapy-based failsafe treatment against emerging multi-drug resistant gonorrhea strains. In our SBIR
phase I proof of concept studies in mice, we showed that GneX12 induces anti-gonococcal T-cell and antibody
responses against existing gonococcal infections, accelerates bacterial clearance and generates protection
against re-infection. Protection was broad, against both homologous and heterologous strains and lasted for at
least six months. Such protection had never been observed. In our subsequent SBIR phase II award, GneX12
dose and regimen were optimized, and initial pharmacokinetics parameters determined after intravaginal
administration. The mechanisms of cross-protection against diverse strains of naturally occurring N. gonorrhoeae
were elucidated, substantiating the scientific basis for the treatment and identifying parameters of protective
immunity for testing in humans. Scaled-up methods for drug product production were developed, and batch-to-
batch consistency, uniformity and stability demonstrated. Finally, a briefing package and set of interrogatives
were prepared and a type C meeting held with the FDA. In our SBIR phase IIb work, FDA-recommended toxicity
studies, including reproductive toxicity, were conducted in rodents. Scaled-up manufacturing methods were
transferred to commercial GMP facilities at Ascendia Pharmaceuticals, along with development and qualification
of analytical methods. GMP drug substance (rhIL-12), suitable for human use, was produced under a co-
development agreement with Akron Biotech, securing for Therapyx an exclusive source of API not otherwise
available on the open market. Finally, we prepared a briefing package and set of interrogatives and conducted
a type B meeting with the FDA in preparation for submission of an IND application. Funds are herein requested
to manufacture and validate cGMP drug product, perform agency-required toxicity studies in monkeys, and
finally, for IND submission. In the future, with separate company funds, we will conduct a phase I/II trial with
GneX12 in women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The trial will be conducted in collaboration with our partners at
the University of Louisville."

It is critical that the host immune system does not mount outright inflammatory responses against foreign
antigens abundant in the lumen of the intestine (such as dietary antigens exposed through the small intestine
mucosa and microbial antigens coming predominantly from the lumen of the large intestine). Failure in this
process leads to a significant health threat to the host as evidenced by prevalence of celiac disease and
inflammatory bowel diseases. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have evolved to play a critical role to ensure this
tolerance. Dietary antigens are known to generate inducible Tregs (iTregs) and systemic tolerance against
those antigens is achieved by circulation of these iTregs throughout the body (oral tolerance). In contrast, it
may not be beneficial for the host to establish systemic, Treg-mediated tolerance against antigens from the
large intestine since self-replicating microbes, the primary source of antigens in the large intestine, can easily
escape and invade tissues outside of the intestine. Our long-term goal is to characterize how Treg-mediated
tolerance against antigens from the large intestine is accomplished. Our central hypotheses are that activation
of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in T cells induces GPR15 expression and promotes iTreg differentiation
simultaneously to produce GPR15+ iTregs and that the GPR15-C10orf99 receptor-ligand pair mediates the
retention of Tregs in the large intestine and prevents systemic dissemination of iTregs, accomplishing local
tolerance by GPR15+ iTregs. Guided by strong preliminary data, we have generated novel mouse models that
will enable us to test these hypotheses. We propose to pursue the following two aims: (1) To characterize
Treg-mediated immune tolerance against microbial antigens in the large intestine compared to systemic oral
tolerance against dietary antigens from the small intestine, we will check whether GPR15-C10orf99 mediate
trafficking of Tregs inside the large intestine lamina propria and Treg retention, in addition to their known
function during extravasation. We will also determine the fate of GPR15+ iTregs and the consequences in
Treg-mediated tolerance against gut microbial antigens after inducible deletion of GPR15. (2) To characterize
the effect of AHR signaling on iTreg differentiation and GPR15 induction, we will test chemicals with reported
AHR ligand activity for their ability to induce FOXP3 and GPR15 expression. We will also examine
mechanisms underlying AHR-induced increase of GPR15+ Tregs in vivo at the cellular level. To understand the
molecular mechanisms for AHR-mediated expression of FOXP3 and GPR15, we will perform CHIPseq
analysis in T cells after AHR activation by specific ligands that we will identify. Our findings will significantly
advance understanding of Treg-mediated tolerance and will help to develop novel therapeutic strategies to
treat various immunological disorders."

Various barriers including stigma can limit access to HIV and substance use for people with HIV who
inject drugs. Acceptance and Commitment Treatment (ACT) empowers these people to cope with
stigma and other care barriers, leading to an increase in health services utilization. ACT is an
evidence-based intervention that uses acceptance, mindfulness, and behavior change processes to
improve psychological flexibility. In the SCRIPT randomized controlled trial, we showed that ACT
could increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and substance use care engagement for people
with HIV and active injection drug use. This study recruited participants at a community-based harm
reduction site and trained psychologists delivered the intervention at a community clinic, but
community-engaged implementation strategies have not yet been studied. Implementation strategies
for evidence-based care access interventions for people with HIV and injection drug use are rare.
This project will narrow this gap, assessing appropriate implementation outcomes and their relations
with trial outcomes. We will also explore implementation strategies, to be tested in future hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trials of ACT. Using the existing mixed-methods data from the SCRIPT
trial, this R03 proposes to assess implementation outcomes and identify implementation strategies
(including intervention adaptation, training, fidelity monitoring). The results from this project will aid in
access to health services for the stigmatized population of people with HIV who inject drugs and
provide the groundwork for future trials testing acceptance-based approaches to improve care access
for people with HIV, substance use and potentially other stigmatized conditions."

Peroxisomes are metabolic organelles that serve as a central hub of cell signaling pathways and have essential
roles in the normal development and functions of all human organ systems. Peroxisome dysfunction is causally
responsible for a large group of rare monogenic disorders where some individuals with the same deleterious
alleles can show dramatic differences in clinical phenotypes that suggest the existence of genetic modifiers.
Furthermore, peroxisome dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of a diverse group of common
disorders. Despite their relevance to numerous facets of human health and disease, the limited number of well-
annotated publicly available mouse models and immunological resources required to investigate peroxisome
structure, assembly, and downstream functions has hindered the research community. Moreover, the impact of
many existing mouse models has been lessened since they often are placed on suboptimal genetic backgrounds
or are not readily available to the public because the investigators who generated them do not have the
infrastructure necessary to distribute them or are encumbered with restrictions or licensing fees to for-profit
companies by the originating research institutions. Here, we will establish the Mouse Peroxisome Research
Resource (MPRR) at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) that will provide a central resource for mouse models and
monoclonal antibodies for basic and translational research relevant to peroxisome biology and disorders caused
by peroxisome dysfunction. The MPRR will be a community-driven effort that leverages a world-leading
knowledge of mouse genetics, gene editing, and monoclonal antibody production capability as well as expertise
in model development and disease model repositories to accelerate the creation, distribution, and proper use of
high-impact mouse models and monoclonal antibody reagents. By leveraging the JAX Genetic Resource
Sciences Repository infrastructure, the MPRR will ensure that all deposited mouse models are on standardized
genetic backgrounds to control for the presence of genetic modifiers. These strains will be made available as
well-annotated resources with as few legal restrictions as possible. Based on community input and the guidance
of its External Steering Committee, the MPRR will also produce novel high-priority mouse models with defined
genotypes on standardized genetic backgrounds, cryopreserve them, and distribute them to the public.
Moreover, the MPRR will also assist in the targeted phenotyping of these models, including measurement of
relevant peroxisomal metabolite levels. Furthermore, based on community input and the guidance of the External
Steering Committee, the MPRR will produce and publicize validated monoclonal antibody reagents for
peroxisome research, including characterizing relevant mouse models, that are made available to the public
upon request. Overall, the MPRR will dramatically increase the number of available mouse models and
monoclonal antibody reagents based on community-driven priority and accelerate preclinical testing of rationally
designed therapeutic interventions for disorders caused by peroxisome dysfunction."

Many potent and effective broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) directed to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein
(Env) trimer have been studied mechanistically and structurally. Combined, their epitopes now cover most of the
external surface of Env. Passive immunization with bNAbs, optimally mixed to minimize viral escape, holds
promise for controlling HIV-1 infection, prevent it, or even helping to cure it. Eliciting bNAbs by active
immunization, however, remains problematic. Our overall long-term goal is to contribute to solving that major
problem. We will develop techniques for quantifying concentrations, affinities, kinetics, and stoichiometry of bNAb
binding in polyclonal sera from infected or immunized animals and humans. We will determine how these
quantities change as germline (GL) responses mature into bNAbs. So far, we have used soluble, native-like
SOSIP trimers to dissect or induce Ab responses. The recent emergence of mRNA vaccination, however, allows
the design of full-length Env constructs, opening the possibility of presenting external bNAb epitopes located
near the membrane while shielding C-terminal neo-epitopes at the base of soluble trimers. We will therefore
make virus-like particles that mimic HIV-1 virions in size, membrane composition, Env density, and Env
interactions with interior viral proteins. The kinetics and stoichiometry of bNAb binding to these full-length
membrane-anchored trimers, with and without changes in the cytoplasmic tail, will be compared with binding to
SOSIP trimers. We will also extend in-depth binding analyses to SOSIP trimers derived from a global panel of
neutralization-resistant HIV-1 isolates. We will dissect binding kinetics, stoichiometry, induced conformational
changes, and the heterogeneity of the interactions, thereby identifying binding characteristics that correlate with
neutralization breadth. In silico analyses of how the midpoints and Hill slopes (h) of the neutralization curves
relate to neutralization breadth, for both single bNAbs and combinations, will guide further experimental
dissections of how binding properties mold cross-reactivity. We will develop assays for measuring entry-fusion
fitness to define the relationship between viral resistance to bNAbs and the efficiency of receptor-facilitated entry.
To achieve these goals, we propose three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Analyze bNAb binding and neutralization properties relevant to passive and active immunization.
Aim 2. Determine how bNAb breadth and binding properties are interrelated.
Aim 3. Dissect the relationship between entry fitness and escape from bNAbs.
In summary, we seek to define how dynamic properties of Ab binding are linked to neutralization breadth. Such
fundamental information may help improve both active and passive immunization strategies, which are highly
relevant to public health."

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), a significant proportion of infected individuals
exhibiting neurocognitive decline, and a prior history of substance use disorder (SUD) may result in an
exacerbated rate of decline. Thus, prior drug history may be clinically significant in the treatment of
neurological HIV-1 infection. The specific aims of the project are: 1) To define the dendritic “spine-
targeted” - microglial interactions which produce HIV-1/psychostimulant-induced synaptodendritic
loss and spine dysmorphology. Dendritic spine loss is a key pathology of HAND; however, the underlying
mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. We will investigate whether HIV-infected microglia play a key role
in spine loss/dysmorphology using an in vitro HIV infection model and psychostimulant drug exposures in sex-
specified brain cell cultures. 2) To establish whether a history of psychostimulant abuse drives an
accelerated progression of microglial dysfunction and dendritic spine alterations following HIV
infection. Dopamine will be assessed both prior to and after EcoHIV-infection in animals with or without a
history of cocaine self-administration. The mechanisms by which HIV-infected microglia produce dopaminergic
circuit dysfunction will be critically tested using proviral gene excision techniques; cART, and SABV are integral
factors of the design. 3) To establish executive function “choice” deficits in EcoHIV-infected animals,
and the role of microglial HIV infection, following psychostimulant self-administration. We will establish
prior drug history and HIV-1 infection as variables that influence the effect of fronto-striatal circuit dysregulation
on choice behavior, thereby identifying factors that may exacerbate resistance to treatment. We will examine
synaptodendritic integrity in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medium spiny
neurons (MSN) of the nucleus accumbens given their sensitivity to drug history and/or HIV-1 infection.
Targeted proviral gene excision of HIV from microglial cells will be used to determine the role of infected
microglial cells in executive function deficits. Thus, this proposal addresses two key questions regarding
neuroHIV – 1) does a history of drug dependence alter the progression and clinical outcomes of HIV-1-
associated neurocognitive disorders? and 2) how do substances of abuse and HIV interact to produce dendritic
spine alterations, one of the key neuropathologies of neuroHIV in the current cART era? The program goal is
to identify how microglial HIV infections produce synaptodendritic loss; knowledge that will lead to novel
therapeutic strategies for restoring fronto-striatal circuitry."
10908658,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stigma is a pervasive barrier to preventing HIV among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Kyrgyzstan is part of
the world’s most rapidly expanding HIV epidemic in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) region, where
HIV is predominantly concentrated among PWID. Our previous work with PWID in Kyrgyzstan found experiences
of HIV, drug use, and drug treatment (i.e. methadone) stigmas were associated with greater HIV risk behavior
and low use of evidence-based HIV services, including syringe service programs (SSP) and methadone to treat
opioid use disorder (MMT), which limited, timely HIV diagnoses. Following the launch of pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) services in Kyrgyzstan, PrEP awareness increased among PWID with limited uptake but was
not associated with stigma suggesting integrating PrEP referrals in stigma reduction programming may increase
PWIDs engagement in PrEP and other evidence-based HIV services. Yet there is little to no evidence base on
the potential effectiveness and implementation needs of evidence-based stigma reduction strategies that
address HIV-related intersectional stigma at multiple levels with PWID in the EECA region.
In line with NIDA and OAR priorities, the long-term goal is to rapidly advance evidence-based stigma mitigation
efforts among PWID to improve HIV service uptake and turn the tide on the rapidly expanding EECA HIV
epidemic. To achieve this goal, the current study will use the ADAPT-ITT model to adapt and refine effective
community-level and health facility-level HIV stigma reduction strategies to intervene on intersecting drug use,
MMT, and HIV stigma in the local context among PWID and MMT clinic staff (AIM 1). We will pilot the resulting
multilevel stigma reduction intervention – LIFT – using a randomized waitlist control trial study design to evaluate
the preliminary effectiveness of the LIFT intervention on stigma reduction and MMT/PrEP use (AIM 2) among 68
PWID and all staff from two MMT clinics. In parallel, a sequential mixed methods design will evaluate LIFT
implementation outcomes and needs among our local implementation partners and 25 key stakeholders (AIM 3)
to develop implementation strategies that can accelerate the pace and scale up of EECA stigma reduction efforts.
To reduce risk of contamination via injection and treatment networks, we will conduct all community- and health
facility-level intervention and waitlist control activities in distinct geographic districts in the capital city of Bishkek.
This R34 pilot is the first EECA study to evaluate intersectional stigma mitigation efforts among PWID to reduce
HIV transmission risk. This R34 is significant because stigma remains a fundamental driver of HIV transmission
globally. This R34 pilot is highly innovative because it extends the current state of HIV stigma intervention
research by integrating strategies that target intersecting stigmas at multiple levels to improve the impact of
evidence-based HIV services and advance the use of implementation science models, methods, and measures
to accelerate our understanding of how to close the stigma reduction research to practice gap."
10780122,"Single ventricle congenital heart defects, in which one ventricle fails to develop leading to mixing of oxygenated
and deoxygenated blood, affect approximately 1 in 1,000 live births and have a 70% mortality rate. The Fontan
operation is the standard surgical treatment, where venous blood is diverted directly to the pulmonary artery via
synthetic or tissue-engineered vascular conduits (TEVCs). TEVCs are of great interest and promise due to their
ability to remodel and grow with children. However, an unexpectedly high incidence of graft stenosis was reported
in a prior TEVC clinical trial, leading to termination. It is likely that overt inflammatory responses caused by graft
material degradation and pre-seeded bone marrow cells may have led to over-proliferation of repopulated host
cells and graft stenosis. By replacing bone marrow cells with human induced pluripotent cell-derived endothelial
cells (hiPSC-ECs) and substituting biodegradable synthetic grafts with native decellularized human umbilical
arteries (dHUAs), we generated TEVCs via coating the lumen of dHUAs with hiPSC-ECs under physiological
shear stress in a flow bioreactor. TEVCs prevented luminal stenosis and clotting after implantation as inferior
vena cava (IVC) interposition grafts in nude rats, a validated model for studying grafts for Fontan procedures. To
make TEVCs immunocompatible to any patient, we have generated hypoimmunogenic universal hiPSC-ECs via
ablation of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) using the CRISPR gene editing. The therapeutic efficacy and
immunocompatibility of universal TEVCs will be investigated via IVC implantation in immune-humanized rats.
Graft patency and blood flow will be monitored by ultrasound, and grafts will be harvested for histological analysis
within 3 months post-implantation. Expanding on using universal, endothelialized vascular conduits, the PI’s
group will also develop a contractile Fontan conduit as a generation 2 therapy to assist blood flow from IVC to
the pulmonary artery, as none of the conduits now in use provide pumping activity, leading to insufficient tissue
perfusion, heart failure, and pulmonary vascular disease. We have recently developed a tissue-engineered
pulsatile conduit (TEPC) by deriving engineered heart tissues (EHTs) made by seeding hiPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes into decellularized native heart matrices and then wrapping the EHTs around a dHUA. We will
develop an immunocompatible TEPC by wrapping EHTs based on universal hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and
cardiac fibroblasts around the above vascular conduits. TEPCs will be matured under electro-mechanical training
conditions in bioreactors to achieve enhanced contractile output to make a strong Fontan conduit that assists
pulmonary circulation. The PI will test the hypothesis that universal TEPCs are immunocompatible and maintain
contractility in the IVC graft model in immune-humanized rats. Ultrasound will be employed to monitor the
patency and pulsatility of TEPCs, and TEPCs will be explanted for histological analysis. Universal hiPSC-TEPCs
will establish the foundation for generating readily available, mechanically active Fontan conduits, providing a
curative therapeutic for patients born with single ventricle congenital heart defects."

Many studies have highlighted a large incidence of hemostatic derangements in the form of hypercoagulable
and hypofibrinolytic states following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These hemostatic disturbances are fueled by and a
consequence of the concomitant activation of the endothelium following a severe inflammatory response, with
likely contribution from many other pathways and components, such as the complement pathway and neutrophil
activation. In COVID-19 patients, the resulting hyperinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and systemic
hypercoagulability, collectively referred to as COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC), manifests as the
increased tendency of micro-thrombosis of different organs leading to organ dysfunction, venous
thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. Reducing the deleterious impact of CAC
during severe SARS-CoV-2 infections continues to represent a major therapeutic challenge. Despite the
enormous effort exerted during the pandemic to understand the pathological mechanisms responsible for the
severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections, a major knowledge gap about the drivers and mechanisms underlying CAC
still exists. Furthermore, as the link between CAC and long COVID becomes more apparent, understanding CAC
is more urgent than ever. Proposed studies are designed to gain knowledge on the drivers and mechanisms
underlying CAC and will test the feasibility of several potential pharmacological approaches to blunt it. Levering
our novel and carefully optimized mouse model of COVID-19 and CAC, relying on a human pathological SARS-
CoV-2 strain and recapitulating major pathological alterations and development of CAC observed in human
patients presents a unique opportunity for hypotheses-driven research in a controlled and systematic manner to
gain important new insights on CAC. Mimicking worldwide observations that males are more susceptible to
severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to females, a sex-dependent bias in disease severity was
also observed in our model that was accompanied by striking temporal, quantitative, and qualitative differences
in the development of CAC. Aim 1 will characterize the major molecular determinants of the sex-biased disease
severity and development of CAC in our mouse model of COVID-19 and CAC. Key questions that will be
addressed are the extent to which the sex bias originates from hormonal differences, whether estrogens are
protective and/or androgens are deleterious, and whether hormonal supplementation therapy can alter the
development of CAC. These studies will help identify novel pathways and targets for CAC. Aim 2 will expand on
our preliminary data to characterize von Willebrand Factor (VWF)’s function(s) and protein/protein interaction(s)
that are responsible for modulating survival during SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of CAC. The results
of these studies will increase our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in regulating the finely tuned interaction
between the immune, endothelial, and coagulation systems upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly leading to the
identification of new therapeutical targets for the treatment of CAC."

The goal of the University of Maryland BaltImore Life Science Discovery Accelerator (UM-BILD) is to create a
new NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) program that serves as a development
engine to build the life science economy in West Baltimore and Greater Baltimore and to train one of the most
diverse biomedical and entrepreneurial workforces in the US. Underrepresented minorities (URM) making up
34% of the population, URMs comprise only 15% of PhD graduates and 4% of tenured faculty positions in
medical schools. Diversity amongst venture-backed founders is even less. This is in the face of evidence that
increased workforce diversity increases productivity, financial performance, and employee satisfaction. UM-BILD
will be formed from a partnership with University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), University Maryland School of
Medicine (UMSOM), University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) (a Minority Serving Institution), University
of Maryland College Park, Morgan State University (a Historically Black College/University (HBCU)), Blackbird

will directly address the need for increased biomedical and startup workforce diversity leveraging existing,
successful initiatives at UMSOM and UMBC. UM-BILD will foster life science industry growth of the
demographically diverse (28% African American and 7% Hispanic) Baltimore Region. UM-BILD will embrace
existing partner programmatic efforts to increase biomedical workforce diversity; as well as direct engagement

1: Provide seed investment and development resources for 11 early-stage technology projects teams per year
enhanced by a $5 million non-federal match funds through partner institutions and MII. Technologies will receive
milestone gated investments of up to $200,000 and access to unique biomedical development facilities at UMB
and UMBC to serve as a dedicated incubator. Aim 2: Train a diverse biomedical and innovation workforce from
elite scientists and innovators. We will offer a dedicated entrepreneurial, project management, and business
development curriculum that will build upon on-going biomedical workforce diversification programs at UMB and
UMBC, and the Baltimore region in general, to allow for a unique cohort of newly trained life science
entrepreneurs, many from URM backgrounds. Aim 3: Create new companies ready to apply for federal
SBIR/STTR awards and raise private capital to grow the life science economy in Baltimore. UM-BILD will provide
services in company formation, training in obtaining federal innovation grants; connections to investors seeking
early-stage life science opportunities (see letters of support); and subsidized space in Baltimore Bioparks."
10754575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a leading cause of illness and disability worldwide; there is a dearth of new mechanistic models for the development of better therapeutic strategies. Studies to date showed that administration of LAC, a pivotal mitochondrial metabolite, leads to a rapid and persistent antidepressant-like response by increasing histone acetyltransferases (HATs) activity and the related expression of a key inhibitor of glutamate release mGlu2 receptor in circuits implicated in TRD. Furthermore, LAC levels are decreased in clinical phenotypes of TRD. The objective of this application is to understand the role of central and peripheral LAC-related mitochondrial metabolism in the regulation of TMS responses in phenotypes of TRD. We will also use computational algorithm and statistical clustering to ascertain the role of the novel biomarkers of TMS responses in the trajectories of functional connectivity, and how these pathways are modified by sex. This contribution will advance our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial metabolism for TMS responses in phenotypes of TRD, and identify sex-differences in these mechanisms."

 Elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with an increased risk of developing
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), a pancreatic cancer subtype making up over 90% of diagnoses.
Increased plasma BCAAs are observed up to 10 years prior to diagnosis, but whether the elevation of these
BCAAs directly contributes to PDA is not known. BCAAs are essential amino acids and their catabolism is
orchestrated by the rate-limiting enzyme, the branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex.
However, whether the elevation of the BCAAs themselves in the plasma or their catabolism is responsible for
PDA is not yet known. We have shown that acinar cells, the predominant cell population in the pancreas often
responsible for PDA initiation, will preferentially use BCAAs over other substrates to produce acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-
CoA is an important metabolite in energy production, epigenetic regulation, and the production of proteins,
carbohydrates, and lipids. We showed that inhibiting acetyl-CoA production in these cells suppressed PDA
initiation. Elevated BCAA levels have also been shown to increase insulin transcription and may lead to
hyperinsulinemia. Insulin is a potent anabolic growth factor that increases pancreatic cancer growth rates. As
insulin is produced in the pancreas, I hypothesize that this local insulin increase will aid PDA progression. This
proposal aims to establish whether BCAAs have a causal role in PDA in both its initiation and its progression. I
hypothesize that PDA initiation depends upon BCAAs as an energy source to promote ADM, while PDA
progression is potentiated by elevated BCAA levels and hyperinsulinemia. To test the initiation hypothesis in Aim
1, I will cross our novel mouse model of pancreas-specific deletion of BCKDH to our murine model of PDA
initiation. Rates of tumor initiation will be assessed through manipulation of the BCAA content in diet and through
genetic ablation of BCAA catabolism. 13C labeling experiments will be done to assess metabolic utilization of
BCAAs in the developing tumor to identify the mechanism by which acinar cells are using BCAAs for initiation.
To test the progression hypothesis in Aim 2, mice will be provided with BCAA-enriched drinking water, which has
been shown to lead to heightened tumor burden when implanted with established pancreatic cancer cell lines.
The effect of increased insulin in these developing tumors will be assessed through genetic knockouts of the
insulin receptor in the pancreatic cancer cells before implantation and by administration of pharmacological
inhibitors. By assessing both tumor cell intrinsic insulin signaling and systemic effects of insulin level
manipulation, I will be able to delineate whether PDA progression is caused by PDA cells directly or by other cell
types in the tumor microenvironment and also whether BCAA catabolism directly impact either of these. The
investigations in this project will provide a better understanding of BCAA metabolism and its contribution to
hyperinsulinemia and identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited pharmacologically in patients with PDA."

Producing the right words while speaking is critical for social, academic, and occupational success. Word
finding or “naming” ability is highly dependent on dominant temporal lobe function, and is commonly impaired
after temporal lobe resection for seizure control. Thus, naming assessment plays multiple roles in the epilepsy
surgery evaluation: Accurate diagnosis of naming impairment implicates the left (i.e., dominant) temporal lobe
as the epileptogenic zone, and naming is the primary task used in electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) to
identify and spare essential language areas from resection to preserve naming postoperatively. Previously, we
enhanced the sensitivity and accuracy of both of these roles by expanding traditional visual object naming
assessment to include clinically relevant auditory-verbal naming, and by incorporating hallmark symptoms of
word finding difficulty in the performance metrics. However, these measures are available only in English, and
available Spanish measures are highly flawed. As a result, we are unable to provide the same level of care for
primary Spanish speakers or Spanish-English bilingual patients due to lack of appropriate tools and
techniques. This highlights an unacceptable racial/ethnic disparity in care in the context of an increasing
proportion of Spanish-English bilingual patients presenting for epilepsy surgery. We have already shown that
using English-only testing for bilingual patients may result in inaccurate dysfunction localization, potentially
confounding the surgery evaluation and leading to increased invasive procedures, or withholding of potentially
curative treatment. Additionally, limiting ESM to one language risks missing critical sites for the other,
potentially resulting in inadvertent removal of brain areas that are critical for the unmapped language. To
address this disparity of care, and advance our understanding of brain-language relations of bilingualism, we
will test Spanish-English bilinguals undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation, capitalizing on unique diagnostic
studies that permit assessment of brain areas that are critical for bilingual functioning. Specifically, this project
will 1) develop and standardize linguistically appropriate Spanish auditory-verbal and visual naming measures
applicable across Spanish dialects, 2) validate these by testing whether Spanish naming performance better
lateralizes epilepsy-related dysfunction than English naming in bilingual patients with unilateral TLE, 3) utilize
these tools to a) tailor stimuli for ESM to identify critical first and second language brain sites, and b) elucidate
key factors that predict the presence and location of distinct unilingual vs co-localized, bilingual naming sites,
and 4) characterize postoperative Spanish and English naming one-year postoperatively. Results promise a
novel, linguistically appropriate Spanish language toolset for clinical and research use, more accurate Spanish
naming assessment for lateralization of cerebral dysfunction, neuroscientifically based guidance for pre-
resection clinical language mapping in bilinguals, and significant improvement in the level of care for Spanish
speakers, not only for epilepsy, but also the multiple neurological conditions that affect expressive language."
10753464,"Tauopathies are devastating neurodegenerative diseases that impair cognition, memory, movement, strength,
and vision. Tauopathies are caused by the accumulation of misfolded pathologic tau protein in affected brain
regions. Tauopathies like Alzheimer's Disease affect millions of aging Veterans. Tauopathies also affect
younger Veterans who develop Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy after repeated blast exposure head
trauma. The Veterans Health Administration expends significant resources supporting tauopathy patients, but,
there are no cures. These diseases are all fatal. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify ways to treat
these patients and to prevent functional debilitation arising from tauopathy neurodegenerations. In this VA
Merit award, we investigated a recently discovered genetic risk factor for tauopathies: EIF2AK3/PERK.
EIF2AK3/PERK encodes a protein kinase that prevents protein misfolding in cells. We found that patient stem
cell-derived neurons carrying EIF2AK3/PERK tauopathy variants showed reduced kinase activity, increased
tau pathology, and increased vulnerability to stress-induced cell death. Last, we found that small molecule
activation of EIF2AK3/PERK signaling reduced tau protein pathology in vitro. Based on our findings, we
hypothesize that EIF2AK3/PERK determines tauopathy neurodegeneration risk in people by regulating tau
protein pathology and neuronal vulnerability to ER stress. Furthermore, our data reveal an exciting, new
strategy to treat tauopathy by pharmacologically enhancing EIF2AK3/PERK signaling. To advance and
translate our findings from the prior funding period, in our renewal application, we propose preclinical studies to
evaluate neurologic function outcomes after genetic or pharmacologic enhancement of EIF2AK3/PERK
signaling in mouse models of tauopathy neurodegeneration. Our 3 specific aims for the renewal application
are: Specific Aim 1. Test how genetic enhancement of EIF2AK3/PERK affects disease onset, progression,
and survival in preclinical mouse model of tauopathy neurodegeneration. Specific Aim 2. Evaluate therapeutic
potential of orally bioavailable phosphatase inhibitors in tauopathy mice. Specific Aim 3. Characterize
proteostatic properties of new small molecule activators of EIF2AK3/PERK pathway. In the animal studies, we
will employ the PS19 tauopathy mouse model that expresses human misfolded tau in the mouse nervous
system and develops phenotypes similar to human tauopathy diseases. We will perform batteries of
behavioral tests to measure neurologic function with respect to cognition, memory, locomotion, strength, and
vision after genetic or pharmacologic treatments. We will also track animal survival after genetic or
pharmacologic modulation of EIF2AK3/PERK pathway. In the drug screening studies, we will quantify tau
protein aggregation in dose-response studies after small molecule treatment using biochemical and cellular
assays to identify new “top hit” compounds that reduce tau pathology based on targeting the EIF2AK3/PERK
pathway. These studies will provide essential preclinical data about using restoring neurologic function
through this signaling process. These studies will generate novel intellectual property and treatments in the
form of small molecule agents that reduce tau protein pathology. Tauopathies are devastating diseases that
affect many Veterans. Treatments are lacking. Our studies directly relate to the objectives of RR&D by
identifying new ways to maintain vital neurologic functions – cognition, memory, locomotion, strength, and
vision – in aging Veterans, Veterans with repeated head trauma injuries, and Veterans with tauopathy
neurodegenerative diseases. Our studies will benefit the mission of the VA by identifying new drug treatments
to prevent neurodegeneration in Veterans especially those carrying genetic risk factors."

10766750,"With an increasing multicultural aging population in the U.S., depressive symptoms in midlife racial/ethnic
minorities are becoming increasingly significant. The prevalence of depression among Asian Americans is
about 4.5 times higher than that of Americans in general. Within the Asian- American demographic, Korean
Americans have the highest rate of depression. Within the Korean-American group, midlife Korean-American
women are at increased risk of depressive symptoms because of their gender and age. Furthermore, the
recent COVID19 pandemic has placed additional stress to this specific population. Korean Americans have a
cultural preference for natural lifestyle management strategies (e.g., promotion of lifestyle physical activity) for
depression as opposed to pharmacotherapy, and there is a cultural emphasis on one’s ability to handle
stresses without outside assistance. A technology-based program using a web app could provide a highly
innovative and effective way to promote lifestyle physical activity and improve depressive symptoms
experienced by this specific population in a manner that appeals to their cultural preference. Yet, few programs
are available for this specific population and little is known about the efficacy of technology-based interventions
in improving depressive symptoms of racial/ethnic minority women including this population. Based on
Preliminary Studies, the research team has developed and pilot-tested the Web-App based Lifestyle Physical
Activity Promotion Program in improving depressive symptom experience of midlife Korean American women
(WPAPP-K). WPAPP-K has several unique features that overcome the shortcomings of existing programs
such as surface and deep cultural tailoring and social media functions. The purpose of this randomized
intervention study is to determine the efficacy of WPAPP-K in improving depressive symptom experience of
midlife Korean American women. The specific aims are to: (a) determine whether the intervention group will
show significantly greater improvements than the control group in self-reported depressive symptom
experience from a pre-test (T0) to post 6-months (T1) and post 12-months (T2); (b) determine whether the
intervention group will show significantly greater improvements than the control group in self-reported lifestyle
physical activity experience from T0 to T1 and T2; (c) identify whether physical activity experience mediates
the intervention effects of the WPAPP-K on depressive symptom experience from T0 to T2; and (d) determine
whether the effects of WPAPP-K on depressive symptom experience are moderated by selected factors. The
study is theoretically guided by the Bandura’s Theory of Behavioral Change and the Stress and Coping
framework by Lazarus and Folkman. The study adopts a randomized repeated measures pretest/posttest
control group design among 300 midlife Korean American women who are nationally recruited. The long-term
goals are to: (a) implement the program in various primary care settings; (b) examine the cost-effectiveness of
the program; and (c) determine if the WPAPP-K will lead to long-term improved health outcomes."
10766751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are estimated to
affect three million individuals in the United States, and the number of people living with IBD continues to rise.
Currently available medications are costly, ineffective for some patients, and associated with serious risks
including opportunistic infections, hepatic inflammation, pancreatitis, and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need
to improve our understanding of the modulators of intestinal inflammation and repair in order to identify novel
therapeutic targets to treat and prevent IBD. The microbiota is the source of various metabolites which can exert
their effects at the site of absorption (intestine), and at distant sites such as brain via bloodstream. In this regard,
the microbiota mimics an endocrine organ, and its output has only begun to be understood. Since various dietary
components, such as dietary fiber, influence the levels of microbiota-derived metabolites, many of the effects of
diets on immune cells could be mediated via the microbiota. Although dietary fiber has some anti-inflammatory
effects, IBD patients are often instructed to limit their fiber consumption to reduce the frequency and severity of
disease flares. However, the mechanism behind dietary fiber-induced exacerbation of IBD-associated symptoms
is poorly understood. In new preliminary studies, we identified that a fiber-rich diet activates ILC2s in the colon
and significantly increases the levels of eosinophils, a type 2 inflammatory immune cell regulated by ILC2s. The
effects of dietary fiber on the eosinophil responses are dependent on the microbiota and are associated with
remarkable changes in microbiota-derived metabolites. Furthermore, the high fiber diet increased disease
severity in a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation. Despite these observations, the mechanisms
through which dietary fiber regulates the ILC2-eosinophil axis and colonic inflammation remain unknown. Based
on our new preliminary data, we hypothesize that microbial metabolites regulate colonic ILC2s and that
alterations of these metabolites by a high fiber diet induce pathologic activation of ILC2s and severe intestinal
inflammation. We propose to generate a detailed understanding of how microbial metabolites influence
inflammatory pathologies in murine models of intestinal inflammation and examine these pathways in human
IBD patient samples. In Aim 1, we will determine what microbial metabolites and host metabolite receptors are
involved in the high fiber diet-induced type 2 inflammation and their role in intestinal damage and inflammation.
In Aim 2, we will employ a novel CRISPR-based microbial gene-editing technique to directly test the microbial
metabolic pathways through which a high fiber diet mediates intestinal inflammation. In Aim 3, we will translate
these findings to human disease and determine how alterations in microbial metabolites and the ILC2-eosinphil
axis correlate with clinical and endoscopic measures of IBD disease activity. In addition to uncovering novel
immunoregulatory mechanisms of diet and microbiota and their unique roles in IBD, these studies will provide
preclinical justification for development of novel therapeutics to target this pathway."
10766791,"Project Summary/Abstract
The colonic epithelium is the site of a host of human diseases, and therefore understanding its development and
function is essential for human health. The colon epithelium is separated into morphologically and functionally
distinct domains, with proliferative stem cells being housed at the bottom of the crypts of Lieberkühn, whereas
differentiated cells populate the epithelium closest to the lumen. The maintenance of epithelial homeostasis in
the crypt is dictated in large part by spatially patterned signals from the underlying mesenchyme. The
mesenchymal cells involved in adult colonic crypt homeostasis have been of recent interest. However, little is
known about the molecular mechanisms underlying colonic crypt formation during development. Our proposal
will determine how mesenchymal cell populations and signals interact with the developing epithelium to
drive colonic crypt morphogenesis and define stem cell dynamics during development and regeneration.
We will accomplish this work through our three aims: First, we will map mesenchymal-epithelial interactions over
the course of colonic crypt development using single cell RNAseq and histological approaches. We will then use
genetically modified mouse models to investigate the specific role of mesenchymal WNT signals in three stages
of colonic crypt development: invagination, elongation, and fission of colonic crypts. Second, we will investigate
the potential re-activation of an embryonic program in both the epithelium and mesenchyme following injury
induced by DSS treatment. We will test the ability of embryonic or injury-associated mesenchyme to stimulate
plasticity, defined as de-differentiation of committed progenitors to a more multipotent state, in the adult
epithelium. Third, we will take a synthetic approach to reconstruct patterned mesenchymal signals around colon
spheroids, and we will use this new model to test the sufficiency of polarized WNT signals to drive colonic crypt
formation in vitro. Overall, our project leverages a combination of in vivo studies, in vitro models, synthetic
engineering and bioinformatic approaches. This comprehensive scope is made possible through a highly
collaborative environment at UCSF and the productive partnership of the two principal investigators carrying out
this project. The findings from this proposal will significantly advance our basic knowledge of colon development
and regeneration, highlighting the dynamics of mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk. This will have implications
beyond our fundamental understanding of colon biology and will help pave the way for discovery of therapeutic
strategies to treat and modulate colonic disease."
10766794,"Project Summary
 Neuropsychiatric diseases affect millions of people world-wide. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified a growing number of sequence variants associated with neuropsychiatric diseases and
related traits, but the majority of these GWAS hits fall within non-coding regions and their functional effects are
difficult to decipher. We hypothesize that the majority of functional non-coding variants related to
neuropsychiatric disease fall within brain cis-regulatory elements (CREs; i.e., enhancers/promoters), and exert
their effects by disrupting transcription factor (TF) binding sites and thereby altering the expression level of genes
encoding proteins expressed in the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex. To identify causal variants underlying
neuropsychiatric disease-related GWAS hits and to map neuropsychiatric disease-related CREs, we propose to
implement a technique called CRE-seq (Cis-Regulatory Element analysis by sequencing). In CRE-seq, individual
CREs are fused to reporter genes, each containing a unique DNA barcode. The resultant CRE-reporter library,
consisting of thousands of constructs, is introduced into living tissue, and reporter gene expression is quantified
by counting barcoded transcripts with RNA-seq. CRE-seq promises to greatly accelerate our ability to measure
the effects of cis-regulatory variants in neuropsychiatric disease. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will use CRE-seq to identify causal cis-regulatory variants at all known GWAS loci associated
with neuropsychiatric diseases and related traits. We will measure the cis-regulatory activity of thousands of
wild-type and variant CREs in mouse cerebral cortex in vivo and in human iPSC-derived forebrain organoids via
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRE-seq library delivery. We will then evaluate the functional effects of
selected variants on TF binding using protein-microarrays containing all known human TFs. Lastly, we will
correlate the results of our CRE-seq analyses with brain eQTL data. In Aim 2, we will establish a template for
interpreting rare neuropsychiatric disease-related variants by systematically mapping the location of human brain
CREs. We will utilize a 'capture and clone' strategy for CRE-seq library construction, which permits analysis of
long (i.e., ~500 bp) tiled reporters at each locus. In this way, we will pinpoint essential TF binding sites (TFBSs)
which are the likely targets of rare functional variants. Next, we will use CRE-seq to analyze the effects of
introducing all possible single-nucleotide substitutions into identified TFBSs. As in Aim 1, we will perform CRE-
seq in both mouse brain and human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids. Taken together, these two Aims will
enable functional interpretation of both common and rare variants in individual human genomes and thereby
facilitate assessment of neuropsychiatric disease risk in patients."
10766795,"SUMMARY
While hydrogen peroxide has long been understood as a toxin used by the human immune system to kill
infectious organisms, only recently has it become well accepted that it serves as a second messenger in
eukaryotes, produced in response to growth factors, cytokines and immune system effectors and promoting or
modulating downstream signal transduction pathways. Through insights contributed in part by the work of the
PI, a family of cysteine-dependent, peroxide-reducing enzymes known as the peroxiredoxins (Prxs) have also
emerged from relative obscurity to become widely recognized not just as one of the primary oxidant removal
systems in almost all organisms, but also as key modulators of cell signaling pathways. PI Poole's work on the
enzymology, biophysical attributes and structures of Prxs from a variety of organisms has contributed greatly to
understanding the mechanism and regulation of this highly abundant family of enzymes. In 2003, PI Poole and
collaborator Andy Karplus published a Science paper in which structural determinants of the sensitivity of Prxs
toward peroxide-mediated hyperoxidation of the active site cysteine were identified. This led to our proposal of
the “floodgate hypothesis” explaining the potential benefits of such a peroxide-mediated “off switch”; under
conditions where peroxide levels begin to rise (e.g. NADPH oxidase activation), Prx inactivation would promote
the local accumulation of peroxide near the source, allowing for the oxidation of alternative protein targets. Dr.
Poole has also been at the forefront of developing chemical tools to evaluate protein oxidation in cells through
targeting sulfenic acid (R-SOH), the direct product of peroxide-mediated oxidation. These probes are now
commercially available and have been used widely by researchers studying redox regulation and signaling to
evaluate protein oxidation with high spatiotemporal precision. PI Poole's lab used these tools to show that
cancer-associated growth factors elicit “hot spots” of protein oxidation proximal to the internalized receptors,
providing support for the floodgate hypothesis. Future studies proposed here will build upon our existing
strengths and collaborations. Specifically, we propose to investigate the effects of additional posttranslational
modifications, including nitration, acetylation and phosphorylation, on Prx structure and activity. We will also
investigate the mechanism by which thioredoxin can regulate and be regulated by human Prxs. The interface
of Prx function with the regulation of signal transduction pathways involving protein oxidation is another area
with significant gaps; we plan to follow up on our data suggesting that Prx inactivation and rising peroxide
levels are key to cell cycle regulation. Finally, a new area that we are currently investigating in collaboration
with Sharon Campbell is the oxidation sensitivity of the cancer-causing G12C mutant of KRAS, which has the
potential to severely limit the effectiveness of recently developed therapeutic agents. These efforts will address
areas important to Prx function and protein oxidation, leading to a new level of understanding through which
medically-and biologically-relevant interventions could be envisioned."
10767119,"This basic research proposal in mice dissects the neural circuitry and receptors that underlie therapeutic vs
side effects of the sleep medicines used to treat Veterans, using a state-of-the-art gene editing approach called
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The support of this CDA2 award would
allow the applicant to be trained in in vivo reverse microdialysis and in vitro electrophysiology to allow him to
comprehensively validate his genetic manipulations and dissection of neurocircuits, and would allow him to
become a leader in pre-clinical sleep research within the VA.
 Disturbed sleep occurs in neuro-psychiatric illnesses such as insomnia, sleep apnea, post-traumatic
stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. United States Veterans have more than double the amount of sleep
disturbance compared to the rest of the population. As a result, sleep medicines like zolpidem (Ambien) and
eszopiclone (Lunesta) are prescribed widely to Veterans. From 2005 to 2014, VA prescriptions of zolpidem
increased nearly 7 times, and VA prescriptions of eszopiclone increased over 100 times for men and over 50
times for women Veterans. However, these medications do not promote a natural sleep and have side effects.
Thus, a better understanding of their mechanism of action is needed to develop better treatments.
 Delta waves are slow brain rhythms at the speed of 0.5 to 4 waves per second, and large amounts of
these waves are a defining feature of `deep' NREM sleep. Delta waves are linked to the restorative aspects of
deep sleep (mood regulation, synaptic homeostasis, cellular energy regulation and clearance of toxic proteins).
Problematically, zolpidem and eszopiclone induce `light' sleep and drastically reduce NREM delta waves. So
perhaps unsurprisingly, these drugs are linked to suicide risk and cognitive problems. Delta waves are
recorded from the cerebral cortex by electroencephalography, but they are generated deep within the brain's
core structure, the thalamus. Excitatory “Thalamocortical (TC)” neurons form the connections from the
thalamus to the cortex, and they act as delta wave pacemakers. But they require an inhibitory drive to perform
this function. This inhibitory drive is provided by the neurotransmitter GABA, which comes from an outer shell-
like part of the thalamus called the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Recent discoveries have shown that a
stimulated TRN promotes delta waves. TRN neurons themselves, receive GABA from wake active neurons in
the basal forebrain and lateral hypothalamus. With this in mind, we will test a hypothesis that GABAergic
inhibition onto TRN regulates delta waves via GABAergic inhibition onto TC neurons. This will be the 1st study
in this topic that dissects molecular, cellular, and brain-region specific mechanisms simultaneously in vivo.
 α3 subunits are a major structural component of the type of GABAA receptors that are native to TRN. In
Specific Aim (SA) 1 we use CRISPR-Cas9 to locally ablate α3 subunits within a subset of TRN neurons that
are defined by the presence of a calcium-binding protein called parvalbumin (PV). Our preliminary data shows
that disrupting this GABA transmission increases NREM delta waves and promotes NREM in vivo; and
reduces spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (sIPSC) in vitro. To add rigor and reproducibility, we use
an alternative mouse genetic approach to overexpress α3 subunits in PV+ TRN neurons. Training will enable
the in vitro work. In SA2 we use CRISPR-Cas9 to locally ablate α1 subunits, which form the type of GABAA
receptors that are native to TC neurons. Here we focus on the paraventricular thalamus, which is involved in
stress-induced arousal. We will also overexpress α1 in the TC neurons. In vitro data will be collected during the
training. In SA3 Dr Uygun will train to use in vivo reverse microdialysis to locally administer eszolpiclone and
zolpidem to TRN and TC neurons. This will examine the delta suppressing component of sleep medicines.
 This work will guide the development of next-generation GABAergic sleep medicines, leading to
improved Veteran patient care with lower suicide risk and better mood and cognitive performance."
10767120,"Due to the physical demands placed on the knees and shoulders of service members, the incidence of
ligamentous injury is high in the Veteran population. These injuries have significant impact on Veterans’ quality
of life and ability to meet their occupational, recreational, and health goals. There is a need for better treatment
options to augment surgical repair or reconstruction for some of these ligament and tendon injuries. In
particular, 73% of massive rotator cuff tears fail to heal following surgical repair, and there are limited graft
options for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. In order to address these shortcomings in current
surgical options, a biomimetic stem cell-based solution would be ideal.
Our approach to this problem is inspired by the body’s own ability to heal after injury. While poorly-vascularized
intra-articular ligament injuries such as ACL tears do not heal, well-vascularized extra-articular ligaments such
as the medial collateral ligament (MCL) can heal without operative intervention. The exact mechanisms behind
this observation are not well-understood. We hypothesize that a major difference between ligament healing
and non-healing is access to vascular supply, specifically, vascular-associated mesenchymal stem cells.
Pericytes are perivascular stem cell (PSC) population that is associated with blood vessels throughout the
body. Studies on tendon remodeling have postulated that pericytes from the tendon sheath are responsible for
neo-tendon formation in the event of tendon injury. However, these reports do not provide any empiric
evidence to support this hypothesis. It is our goal to provide definitive evidence of this hypothesis by using a
lineage tracing mouse model and a model of pericyte ablation to systematically establish the role that pericytes
play during ligament healing. We further propose to evaluate the efficacy of using human pericytes to treat
injuries to fibrous tissues such as the MCL and for a tissue-engineered ACL graft. Regardless of whether
pericytes directly contribute to ligament healing, they remain an attractive clinical option due to ease of
isolation and likely trophic effects. Our over-arching goal is to establish a basic science mechanism and proof
of concept for PSC-based therapies for ligament and tendon injuries. The overall hypothesis of this highly
clinically relevant proposal is that pericytes contribute to extra-articular ligament healing; and that exogenous
PSC-based therapies can enhance healing in both intra-articular and extra-articular ligament injuries.
If successful, these studies would collectively establish the foundation for new pericyte-based therapies to treat
ligament injuries that are unfortunately very common in Veterans. Specifically, these would include both
injections to promote the non-operative healing of extra-articular ligament injuries such as MCL sprains,
adjunct therapy for surgical treatment of tendon and ligament tears such as rotator cuff injuries, and cell-
seeded constructs for the surgical reconstruction of intra-articular ligament injuries such as ACL rupture."
10874708,"ABSTRACT
The renewal application Translational Program of Health Disparities Research Training (TRANSPORT II) builds
on the successful research training programs established at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University
(Downstate). Downstate is the only health sciences university in Brooklyn, the largest borough in New York City
with a population of approximately 2.6 million people and is located in a federally designated medically
underserved area. There is a dire need for scientists who can conduct rigorously designed research that informs
the development of sustainable solutions and advances equity. Over the past 5 years, our team implemented
diversity-focused research training programs that reached 109 students and faculty. The mission of renewal
TRANSPORT II is to maximize these successes by recruiting and training a diverse research workforce and
developing strategic partnerships with key community stakeholders from multiple sectors. TRANSPORT II will
prioritize four areas: 1) enhancement of the physical infrastructure and space which is critical for accommodating
our rapidly growing programs, 2) expansion of research training and career development programs for students
and faculty who are from underrepresented backgrounds, 3) fostering multisectoral community academic
partnerships, and 4) growing a critical mass of established social science, behavioral population health, and
implementation science researchers. Multitiered programs will include: The Community Health Advocates
Mentorship Program (CHAMPS) that combines research methods with health advocacy skills, empowering high
school students to become change agents in their communities. The Summer Program in Translational and
Community Engaged Research (SPRINTER) for undergraduate students, the Program to Accelerate Academic
Careers in Equity Research and Social Justice (PACERS) for pre-doctoral students. These programs provide a
short intensive program for students in undergraduate and graduate health professions schools, respectively.
The Transitions to Academic Careers (TRACS) will strengthen research capacity in graduate students yearlong
as they transition to the next level of their academic research careers. The TRANSPORT II infrastructure will
also expand training for post-doctoral and junior faculty and the recruitment of senior faculty. Finally, the
Community Science Cafés will provide an innovative structured venue for convening community partners from
multiple sectors and providing them with community-based participatory research and grantsmanship courses.
The collective impact of these programs will scale up the capacity for conducting transformative health equity
research at Downstate from over 100 to more than 550 trainees and community partners."

The assembly of actin filaments into Arp2/3 complex-branched filament networks powers numerous
fundamental eukaryotic cellular processes, including motility, endocytosis, and cytokinesis. Members of the
actin depolymerization factor homology (ADF-H)-domain protein family, which includes cofilin and glial
maturation factor (GMF), accelerate branched actin filament network reorganization and turnover. Cofilin and
GMF accelerate network remodeling by debranching Arp 2/3 complex. Cofilin accelerates network turnover by
fragmenting filaments and increasing the concentration of filament ends where subunits add and dissociate.
This MIRA proposal integrates biochemical and biophysical approaches, including electron cryo-microscopy,
microfluidics, and a recently developed microscopic magnetic cylinders assay, to develop predictive models of
actin filament and filament network mechanics, remodeling and fragmentation. General principles regarding the
relationship between actin filament elasticity, conformation and regulatory protein occupancy will emerge from
this work."

Survival for breast, prostate and colorectal cancer has improved dramatically over the past three
decades as a result of advances in treatment and screening for the detection of these common
cancers at an earlier stage. However, African Americans (AAs) still suffer from a higher mortality
rate after diagnosis of these cancers compared with other racial and ethnic groups. One of the
consequences of prolonged survival is the possibility of developing one or more new primary
cancers in their lifetime. It has been estimated that overall nearly 10% of cancer survivors will be
diagnosed with a second primary cancer, with some variability in estimates across studies which
is not thoroughly understood, particularly among AAs, who we’ve been shown to have poorer
survival after a second primary diagnosis. Understanding the underlying causes of second
primary cancers is critical in order to design strategies for risk mitigation and early detection.
Importantly, the multiple primary cancer (MPC) phenotype can be a used to understand both
genetic susceptibility and environmental risk determinants.
The proposed investigation will build upon the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS)
study, one of the largest cohorts conducted exclusively among AA cancer survivors to understand
the multiplex causes of poorer outcomes in the population. We will focus both on breast, prostate
and colorectal cancer survivors enrolled in Detroit ROCS who developed a second primary cancer
and use the existing infrastructure to enroll new participants diagnosed with MPCs. We will 1).
sequence DNA collected from whole blood or saliva of 1000 participants diagnosed with MPCs
(500 AA and 500 non-Hispanic white (NHW)) as well as 500 AA survivors diagnosed with a single
primary cancer (SPC) to characterize the mutational landscape overall and compare the spectrum
and prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations by race and MPC/SPC status. We
will 2). calculate cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS) using largely existing genotype
data to understand the contribution of more common variants and PRS to the risk of MPCs.
Finally, we will 3). evaluate select environmental risk factors collected as part of the Detroit ROCS
survey for their association with MPC using a 3:1 matched design comparing these participants
to those diagnosed with first and only primary breast, prostate and colorectal cancer (1500 SPCs).
This study is the first of its kind to address the contributing factors in the development of MPCs
among AA cancer survivors."
10767254,"Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises >50% of all brain tumors in adults and is the most malignant form with a 5-year
patient survival rate of 3.3%. Standard-of-care treatment involves maximal surgical resection followed by
radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide); however, as the poor survival rate indicates, these treatments
have not been effective in preventing disease progression. Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous with a
small subpopulation of neural stem-like cells notorious for their resistance to conventional therapy and known
to be responsible for tumor recurrence and patient death. Therapies that target tumor cells as well as glioma
stem cells (GSCs), while sparing normal cells, would be highly beneficial for these patients. The unique
capacity of mammalian olfactory epithelium in continuous replacing its olfactory receptor neurons by
physiological turnover and following injury throughout life has been attributed to the olfactory ensheathing cells
(OECs), a glial cell type that closely accompany the axons as they grow from the olfactory epithelium into the
olfactory bulb. OECs migrate from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system (CNS), a
critical process in the development and maintenance of the olfactory system and axonal extension after injury
in neural regeneration. OECs release diffusible factors to attract neural progenitors into the rostral migratory
stream and regulate their proliferation and differentiation and to differentiate neural stem cells leading to
neurite extension. Owing to their strong ability to myelinate and guide axonal outgrowth, neuroprotective role,
as well as their immunomodulatory and phagocytic properties, the therapeutic potential of OECs was evaluated
against different neurological pathologies in the clinic and as a carrier for therapeutic transgene to glioma cells
in culture, but their tropism and effect against gliomas in vivo were not studied. Recently, we showed for the
first time that autologous transplantation of mouse OECs can target and deliver therapeutic transgenes to brain
tumors upon intranasal administration, the natural route of OECs to CNS. In this proposal, we will build on this
study and evaluate the potential use of OECs for glioblastoma stem cell therapy by regulating proliferation
and/or differentiation of GSCs, making them susceptible to conventional therapies, reversing immune
supression and activating anti-tumor immunity."
10767260,"Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) is a debilitating urologic condition characterized by
bladder/pelvic pain and urinary symptoms such as urgency and frequency. Treating UCPPS remains a serious
challenge for clinicians in part because the mechanisms of the disease are not well understood. This challenge
is even greater when patients have pain outside the pelvis and/or comorbid pain syndromes, as the central
nervous system (CNS) may play a significant role in their symptoms, a phenomenon we term “centralized” pain.
The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network was initiated in
response to these challenges. In a site-specific study conducted during first phase of MAPP, we showed that
when immune cells isolated from UCPPS patients are stimulated ex vivo, the resulting inflammatory response
distinguishes patients with localized pain from those with a more widespread pain presentation. In the second
phase of MAPP, samples of stimulated whole blood have been collected on the vast majority of patients in
conjunction with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI), psychophysical sensory testing,
and a comprehensive battery of patient reported outcomes. However, as the second phase of MAPP draws to
a close, funding is not available to analyze these stimulated samples. In the current project, we propose to
complete this critical work and elucidate how inflammation influences the CNS in UCPPS. We have assembled
a team of MAPP investigators and added expertise in clustering and classification bioinformatics in order to
address three scientific aims. AIM 1: Validate the inflammatory phenotype of UCPPS. (A) We will replicate and
extend our previous cross-sectional findings indicating that stimulated inflammatory responses may be able to
classify UCPPS patients with greater clinical evidence of centralized pain (test n = 200, validation n = 200). (B)
We will determine if longitudinal changes in genitourinary symptoms and pain over 18 months are paralleled by
changes in the stimulated inflammatory responses in a subset of these patients (n = 250). AIM 2: Identify a
neurobiological signature of the inflammatory phenotype using fcMRI and psychophysical sensory testing. (A)
We will conduct cross-sectional analyses to identify neurobiological correlates of the inflammatory phenotype
(test n = 200, validation n = 200). (B) We will create longitudinal models to determine if identified fcMRI and
psychophysical outcomes co-vary with inflammation over time (n = 250). AIM 3: Identify biotypes of UCPPS
using combined inflammatory, neuroimaging, psychophysical, and clinical data. We will use bioinformatics
techniques including canonical correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering to attempt to define unique, latent,
biotypes of UCPPS. We hypothesize that these biotypes will reflect different clinical phenotypes and may be
useful for predicting treatment responses. The impact of these studies is that they may lead to novel therapeutic
targets and tailored treatments for UCPPS by elucidating an important and under-studied mechanism of UCPPS
symptomology."
10780794,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The deadliest form of advanced-stage prostate cancer is treatment-resistant metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which occurs in ~35% of patients after exposure to androgen
receptor (AR)-directed therapies such as Abiraterone and Enzalutamide, resulting in a dismal median
survival of only ~5.5 months. Unfortunately, detection of treatment-resistant disease typically occurs
too late, when patients are already progressing on AR-directed drugs, after which they succumb rapidly
to their disease. There is therefore a critical need to detect AR resistance more sensitively and earlier
in the disease course. To address this, our team designed a novel cell-free DNA assay called Enhancer
and Neighboring Loci of Androgen Receptor Sequencing (EnhanceAR-Seq), built upon the Cancer
Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) platform, and demonstrated superb sensitivity
for detecting AR gene body and enhancer locus alterations in plasma collected from mCRPC patients.
Notably, we applied our EnhanceAR-Seq technology to mCRPC patient plasma and showed that the
results correlate strongly with clinically verified resistance to AR-directed therapy, and significantly
outperform circulating tumor cell (CTC) AR-V7 detection. Building upon this, the current proposal will
evaluate whether our EnhanceAR-Seq technology can be used to predict both (Aim 1) pre-treatment
and (Aim 2) on-treatment resistance to AR-directed therapy in mCRPC patients. Further, in Aim 3 we
will investigate whether integrating EnhanceAR-Seq with genome-wide methylation sequencing can
granularly refine our ability to predict treatment resistance and monitor both clonal and phenotypic
evolution in mCRPC. We are uniquely positioned to accomplish this through our interdisciplinary team
comprised of cell-free DNA genomicists, bioinformaticians, oncologists, and statisticians. Overall, this
study has significant translational impact by establishing cell-free genomic and epigenomic biomarkers
of tumor evolution and resistance to AR-directed therapy in men with lethal prostate cancer."
10778683,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Loss of eyesight is regarded among the worst possible diseases by most Americans. Despite being rare
causes of vision loss, inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are molecularly simple single-gene defects, and
advances in genetics and genomics have raised hopes for the development of gene-based treatments. For
most IRDs, the natural history of disease involves progressive vision loss and successful interventions must
demonstrate a clinically meaningful slowing of the natural progression. Many good metrics have been
developed to measure vision loss but the continued lack of approved IRD treatments strongly suggest better
outcome measures are still needed. The long-term objective of the research is to predict retinal locations
maximally vulnerable to progression over the next 2 years individualized for each patient across distinct IRDs.
Successful predictions of loci of vulnerability will drive reliable measurements of functional and/or anatomical
changes over the duration of typical clinical trials. The focus of the current project is on two human IRDs that
remain without approved treatments – autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by RHO mutations
(RHO-ADRP) and Stargardt disease caused by ABCA4 mutations (ABCA4-STGD). Average tendencies for
spatio-temporal progression in both diseases are well investigated. However, the reliable and individualized
prediction of the photoreceptor locations maximally vulnerable to fast progression remains a major challenge.
Current literature and preliminary studies support the hypothesis that retinal cross-sectional structure at each
location when considered together with the structure of its immediate neighborhood retains enough information
to predict vulnerability to disease progression. The current project will involve a combination of retrospective
longitudinal and prospective longitudinal studies that operate on different spatial scales and structure/function
dimensions, to test the hypothesis and provide a more complete understanding of the range of photoreceptor
vulnerability to disease progression in IRDs. Aim 1 will first use a unique existing data set obtained serially in
RHO-ADRP patients and train an artificial intelligence (AI) model to learn input OCT features that correspond
to disease progression. Trained AI will be applied to another unique existing data set obtained in ABCA4-
STGD patients. With special attention to heterogenous transition zones, retinal locations maximally vulnerable
will be mapped and validated against serial data. Aims 2 and 3 will use prospective serial studies in ABCA4-
STGD to test predictions directly with en face imaging, ultra-wide angle OCT recordings, microperimetric
evaluation of rod- and cone-specific light sensitivities, and novel adaptive-optics OCT imaging of the outer
retina. The project should provide novel insight into the interaction of human photoreceptors with their diseased
neighbors and allow optimum localization of visual function measurements to provide individualized and
sensitive outcome measures for ABCA4-STGD clinical trials."

The Aga Khan University/Columbia University (AKU/CU) Global Network Research Unit is applying to continue
its membership in the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research (Global Network [GN]). At
CU, the project is located in the Department of OBGYN and at AKU within the Department of Community Health
Sciences (CHS). To date, our site has been among the most productive in the GN. We have fully participated in
all aspects of the GN from developing successful concepts for single site and common protocols to leadership
on GN committees. We have acquired non-GN funds both to support GN multisite projects and to strengthen the
Department of CHS at AKU. We have proven access to large urban and rural populations and have successfully
performed many hospital-based and community-based studies. We have contributed more clusters to the GN
Registry and cluster-randomized trials than any other site. Our follow-up rates and the quality of our data are
excellent. Over the 22 years in the GN, we have enrolled nearly 300,000 women and children into GN projects
and authored over 300 papers. In the next 7 years, we plan to continue or surpass this level of engagement as
detailed below. As part of the GN, we will conduct multi-center trials of interventions for pregnant women,
newborns and children to reduce their mortality and morbidity in Pakistan and other low-resource countries. We
understand that the specific projects will be chosen by a stand-alone committee and these could originate either
from a GN investigator or an investigator from outside the GN. We will continue to maintain a population-based
registry of pregnancies and their outcomes in Pakistan, to measure trends and factors associated with those
outcomes and to compare risk factors and outcomes to other GN sites. We will continue being a leader among
the GN sites in protocol development, subject recruitment, data quality and obtaining outside funding for GN
projects and continue to stimulate the development of Pakistani researchers and promote collaborations between
AKU researchers and those from CU and other US sites. We will continue to attract new Pakistani and US
investigators to global maternal and child health research by systematic mentoring of junior investigators and
recruiting senior scientists from related fields, and to continue enhancing the research environment at AKU by
providing high-quality administrative, financial, statistical and research support services within a scientifically
stimulating multidisciplinary setting. We also will continue to support government endeavors to strengthen the
health system in our research site by facilitating training on new cost-effective interventions suitable for countries
with limited resources. Because of the many strengths of our research team and its dedication to improving the
health of women and children in low-resource settings, as well as its long history of collaboration within the GN
and with many entities in Pakistan, we strongly believe that the goals described above will be achieved almost
immediately and continue indefinitely, and that the AKU/CU site will continue to be a leader in the GN."
10843844,"Acupuncture is a millennia-old therapy, which is increasingly being integrated in conventional care for the
treatment of a range of conditions, particularly chronic pain disorders. A critical component of acupuncture
therapy is the existence of specific locations across the body surface where inserting and manipulating a
needle can engender salubrious, clinically beneficial effects. These locations are termed acupuncture points, or
acupoints, and have been the source of much controversy for the acupuncture research field. Indeed, lack of
clarity on the biological basis of acupoints has greatly hindered their more widespread integration into clinical
care. Several decades ago, the World Health Organization sought to standardize body locations for 361
commonly acknowledged acupoints. However, bringing together traditional acupoint nomenclature with
conventional understanding of anatomy/physiology is still a work in progress, and a comprehensive
understanding of the anatomy and physiology of acupoints continues to elude researchers in this field. Hence,
the creation and sustained curation of an open-access repository and database for acupoint research would
create an important bridge between traditional theory and modern understanding of anatomy and physiology.
We propose an open-access web-based portal and database incorporating 1) an acupoint ontology using both
Traditional East Asian Medicine (TEAM) and conventional biological nomenclature systems, 2) male and
female standardized human and rat body atlases with 3D coordinate system, and 3) an easily searchable
database, curated by an expert committee, that contains previously published physiological data associated
with acupoint stimulation. Our platform, called the Topological Atlas and Repository for Acupoint research
(TARA), forms an invaluable Research Resource Center for the acupuncture research and clinical community
by strengthening the biological basis of acupoints, facilitating acupuncture integration into clinical care. Our
platform will be highly consistent with NCCIH priorities and objectives to advance fundamental science and
methods development, advance research on the whole person, integrate complementary and conventional
care, and facilitate further creation of objective, evidence-based information supporting acupuncture."
10904767,"Project Summary/Abstract
Structural racism and discrimination, which affects processes, policies and regulations that govern myriad
systems, have been described as the root cause of social determinants of health and provide a framework for
understanding child health disparities. Further, these structural factors affect life experiences and induce stress,
which leads to a cascade of changes in biologic function and physiological stress responses, including epigenetic
processes. Hence, both upstream (within the societal or neighborhood realm) and downstream (within the
individual or biological realm) factors coalesce to influence children’s health disparities, including disparities in
neurodevelopmental and respiratory health, which are both widespread, socially patterned, and largely
unexplained by individual-level risk factors alone. Exposure to environmental toxicants (a downstream factor)
has been implicated in children’s neurodevelopmental and respiratory health disparities. Thus, in Aim 1, we
propose to elucidate profiles of exposure to chemical mixtures during the prenatal and postnatal periods that
impair neurodevelopmental trajectories and assess whether these effects are modified by maternal
discriminatory experiences. In Aim 2, we propose a novel conceptualization of structural racism to capture
impacts across multiple domains and will evaluate the potential role of environmental toxicant exposures and
epigenetic aging as mediators of the relation between structural racism and child neurodevelopment. In Aim 4,
we will explore racial and ethnic differences in preconception exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and
children’s respiratory health outcomes. Our ECHO Cohort Study Site (Aim 3) will enhance the geographic and
racial/ethnic heterogeneity of the ECHO Consortium with the recruitment of study participants from Houston,
Texas, the fourth largest and most diverse city in the nation, and located in a region for which there is currently
very limited representation in ECHO. Houston is also characterized by no zoning and a large petrochemical
complex, a busy seaport, heavily trafficked roadways, and numerous hazardous waste sites, which lead to
complex exposure profiles. Hence, inclusion of participants from our Study Site will strengthen the ability of the
ECHO Cohort to address research questions related to children’s environmental health disparities. Our proposed
research will be enhanced by a comprehensive Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) that
leverages institutional infrastructure for diversity, equity, and inclusion and successful investigator development
programs funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and NIMHD/NIEHS/NICHD; will
provide mentoring to team members who are at different career stages; and engage community partners,
governmental officials and advocacy groups with whom we have trusting relationships to promote the ECHO
Program, obtain feedback on the conduct of studies to ensure diversity of ECHO cohort participants, and assist
in translation and dissemination of results to maximize impact."
10779555,"Abstract
Most studies of the neuronal mechanisms of visual perception and cognition utilize tasks that control for the
influence of eye movements. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the effects of eye movement are
finite and well-characterized. Yet decades of research have demonstrated that the effects of eye movements
on brain activity are dynamic and extend well beyond the time of the physical movement of the eyes. Thus,
experimenters can restrict eye movements for experimental ease, but ultimately a meaningful account of vision
for the translation of laboratory results to a clinical setting must link what we see to how we engage with the
visual world.
Assessing the impact of eye movements on visual processing has been difficult to accomplish because
different types of eye movements naturally interact, but they have been studied in isolation. The standard
approach makes it difficult to scale-up the existing body of knowledge in an ecologically valid way. To address
this knowledge gap, in recent experiments we measured the responsiveness of prefrontal cortical neurons to
different types of eye movements. We discovered populations of prefrontal neurons that respond robustly to
both fast and slow eye movements. These measurements suggest a novel view of visual-motor integration in
prefrontal cortex in which eye movements, like other signals in prefrontal cortex, exhibit mixed selectivity. In
this view, information about where, when, and how to move the eyes is regulated by shared neural circuitry.
The flexibility of this circuitry allows for the precise coordination of visual perception and different types of eye
movements.
The diversity of brain signals present in frontal cortex makes it an ideal testbed for dissecting the neural
circuitry that mediates how and why we move our eyes. We propose experiments that take an eye movement-
centric approach to record from populations of frontal lobe neurons to address longstanding issues in active
vision. Our first specific aim is to record from prefrontal neurons to determine the extent of shared vs.
independent contributions of prefrontal activity to vision and different types of eye movements. Our second
specific aim involves recording in both brain hemispheres simultaneously to determine how the multitude of
potential eye movement commands are resolved to generate a single visual behavior. The final specific aim is
to measure neuronal activity across frontal cortex to determine whether the coordinated timing of activity
across brain regions governs the ability to switch between different types of eye movements. Collectively,
these experiments will use targeted population recordings across three distinct scales of cortical signals to
provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms that support everyday visual function."
10763010,"IL-17 and Th17 cells are dysregulated in many pathologic auto-inflammatory conditions.
Antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis (AGN) occurs when unchecked inflammation triggered by
autoimmune Ab complexes that deposit in glomeruli and lead to kidney damage, which occurs in
conditions such as Goodpasture disease, ANCA vasculitis, etc. Although the initiators of
autoantibody-mediated pathology differ, the terminal events in end organ kidney damage have
many common hallmarks, and the fundamental immunology of this process is still not well
understood. Accumulating evidence from our groups and others have convincingly demonstrated
role for IL-17 in driving pathogenesis of AGN in humans and in mouse models. Excessive
autoimmune pathology can be caused by hyper-production of cytokines from T helper cells or by
over-exuberant cytokine signaling. Therefore, in principle, molecules that influence IL-17 signal
transduction have the potential to be viable targets for therapy in settings where this cytokine is a
disease driver. In probing the fundamental mechanisms that mediate IL-17-dependent signaling,
we identified two novel RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that contribute significantly to the
pathogenesis of AGN in vivo. These RBPs are downstream of IL-17 and their activities in the IL-
17 pathway are interconnected through regulation of CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP)
transcription factors. In turn, C/EBPs mediate IL-17-dependent effectors that promote renal
inflammation, including Lipocalin-2, neutrophil-recruiting chemokines, and feed-forward activators
of Th17 differentiation such as IL-6. Our central hypothesis is that IL-17 promotes inflammation
through post-transcriptional regulation of downstream mRNAs that drive renal pathology in AGN.
This proposal will evaluate the molecular mechanisms by which these RBPs act and the specific
physiological functions in the setting of AGN."
10744222,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deafness at birth frequently originates from defects in the development of sensory cells in the inner ear. Likewise,
hearing degradation during life frequently follows damage sustained by these cells after normal development. In
each case, a particularly susceptible cellular compartment is the hair bundle, a specialized structure in each
sensory cell that detects and relays sound-borne vibrations. The hair bundle is an array of actin-based membrane
protrusions, or stereocilia, precisely organized in rows of graded heights. Although the tiered architecture of the
hair bundle is fundamental for sensory function, the molecular machinery required for its assembly during
development and for the maintenance of its exact dimensions during life remains obscure. To address these
open questions, we propose to exploit knowledge gained from our ongoing investigations of the GPSM2-Gαi
protein complex in mouse. Absence of the scaffold protein GPSM2 or inhibitory G proteins (Gαi) result in
defective hair bundle assembly, a likely etiology for congenital hearing loss in Chudley-McCullough syndrome.
The GPSM2-Gαi protein complex is first enriched on one side of the nascent hair bundle only (the bare zone),
and then enriched at the tip of stereocilia in the adjacent first row, a distribution required for proper stereocilia
placement and elongation, respectively. We showed that the Myosin-15A motor transports GPSM2-Gαi to
stereocilia tips, where in turn GPSM2-Gαi increases Myosin-15A amounts compared to other rows to define the
tallest identity of the first row. Based on detailed preliminary data, we hypothesize that, 1) As yet unstudied Gαi
regulators act as upstream cues to selectively enrich the GPSM2-Gαi complex only in the bare zone region of
the apical membrane and only in a single row of stereocilia. 2) Prior GPSM2-Gαi enrichment on one side of the
nascent hair bundle is the mechanism by which GPSM2-Gαi becomes restricted to abutting stereocilia in the
first row, giving the hair bundle its tiered architecture. 3) Continued enrichment of GPSM2-Gαi at stereocilia tips
after development has a role in maintenance of proper stereocilia height and girth in adult hair bundles. To test
these hypotheses, we will: 1) Characterize the role of a negative Gαi protein regulator that we already established
as a new deafness gene critical for GPSM2-Gαi complex localization and hair bundle morphogenesis. 2) Use a
new chemical protein labeling technology and new reporter mouse models to track discrete pools of GPSM2-
Gαi and follow their dynamic trafficking to the bare zone and stereocilia tips in time. 3) Inactivate GPSM2-Gαi
function in structurally and functionally normal hair bundles in adults, and monitor stereocilia dimensions,
stereocilia actin dynamics and mouse auditory function. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that shape
and preserve hair bundles will help interpret and design treatments for sensory cell dysfunction, the principal
cause of hearing loss."
10851949,"Respiratory viral infections trigger wheezing illnesses in children and increase the risk that these children will
go on to develop asthma. It is now recognized that asthma is not created equal among children. There are
different forms of asthma, and risk for asthma is highest among wheezing children who also have allergies. It is
currently not well understood why children with wheezing and allergies are more susceptible to respiratory viral
infections and more likely to develop asthma. However, an important clue from our previous studies is that the
immune factors that are associated with risk versus protection to virus-induced wheezing can be found locally
in the airways and lung and also systematically in the blood and bone marrow. This suggested our overarching
hypothesis that the immunological mechanisms that determine susceptibility to virus-induced wheezing operate
both locally and systemically through a lung-blood-bone marrow axis. Here, we will study systemic immune
responses to viruses in children with or without wheezing, allergic inflammation, or both. The research will
entail culturing blood-derived immune cells from the children in the presence or absence of a virus. Molecular
profiling technologies will be employed to characterize immune responses to the virus at the resolution of
single cells, and the responses will be compared and contrasted in groups of children with or without wheezing
and/or allergic inflammation. We hypothesize that risk for asthma is determined by the balance of the biological
activity of two immune factors that control immune responses to viruses: Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)
and the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor subunit gamma (FCER1G). We additionally hypothesize that a
highly specialized population of immune cells called dendritic cells control the balance of IRF7 and FCER1G
activity. The findings from this study are important because asthma affects 1 in 13 Americans and is the most
common chronic disease among children. Each year in the United States, asthma accounts for more than 5
million GP visits, more than 1.5 million visits to the emergency department, and almost 200,000 discharges
from hospital inpatient care. Moreover, approximately 11 people die from asthma every day in the United
States. Understanding the immunological and molecular factors that determine asthma risk will pave the way
for the development of new approaches to treat or prevent asthma and reduce the overall burden of this
disease on children and their families."

Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, interact with distinct molecular pathways in human
cells to promote virus replication and alter immune activity. When considering patient cohort variability, morbidity
and mortality are often higher for women than men for select influenza virus infections, exemplified in the 2009
H1N1 pandemic. Estradiol, a major sex hormone, has been shown to impact virus replication in a sex-specific
manner. Yet much remains unknown as to the pathways different viruses engage to promote infection and alter
immune activity or what pathways link estradiol activity to virus replication. This research program uses recently
developed bioinformatics algorithms and NIAID-supported, published datasets in order to reveal new pathways
and molecules involved in infection with influenza viruses and SAR-CoV-2 (Aim 1) and in infection in respiratory
cells derived from women and treated with estradiol (Aim 2). More specifically, we will use two dynamic network
perturbation algorithms, ProTINA and DeltaNeTS+, to create dynamic mathematical models of intracellular
signaling in order to predict important disease modulators. Dynamic network perturbation analysis will be applied
to virus-specific, virus-host interaction networks and host gene expression data induced by each virus. For Aim
2, we have identified gene expression data from influenza-infected nasal cells from female donors that are
pretreated with estradiol. We will validate ProTINA’s and DeltaNeTS+ ability to identify host factors of virus
replication using results from published siRNA- and CRISPR-based screens. After the validation, we will perform
an in-depth characterization of the most significant proteins identified in order to generate new hypothesis on the
host pathways that are involved in infection with different respiratory viruses or that interact with estradiol during
infection."

Orlance has developed a lead universal influenza (UFlu) DNA vaccine to address the need for a vaccine that
can protect from annual influenza and the emergence of new variants that could cause future pandemics. Our
UFlu vaccine is a multi-dose vaccine designed to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses that can
prevent transmission and minimize disease from currently circulating and emerging strains by inducing broad
antibody and cellular immune responses that target conserved viral sequences common across all influenza
subtypes. Under previous SBIR funding, we showed that our gene gun (GG)-delivered UFlu DNA vaccine
induced broadly specific (universal) antibody and T cell responses and protection from diverse influenza
challenges in rodents and nonhuman primates. This vaccine is nearing Phase 1 human trials and will require a
clinic ready GG device to administer it. Here, we propose to continue developing our promising MACH-1TM GG
to deliver the lead UFlu DNA vaccine and other lead vaccines to humans. The MACH-1 is a needle-free device
that delivers DNA- and/or RNA-coated gold microparticles directly into epidermal cells using high pressure gas.
It is pain free, requires substantially lower doses of DNA or RNA to induce protective immunity compared to other
delivery methods, and has been engineered with several innovations to maximize efficiency and reproducibility
of delivery. Here, we will: improve the MACH-1 by making it portable and easier to use (Aim 1); develop a GMP-
scalable DNA vaccine formulation into fill and finish disposable dosing units (Aim 2), and evaluate safety,
immunogenicity, and efficacy of the UFlu vaccine delivered by the improved MACH-1 in mice and swine models
(Aim 3). Successful completion of these Aims will result in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling
documentation for the delivery system device and formulation platform necessary to advance our MACH-1
delivered UFlu DNA vaccine to Phase 1 trials."
10896315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recording whole-brain activity with single neuron resolution and millisecond timescale precision is crucial to
understanding how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Simultaneous
recording and stimulation of large populations of neurons distributed throughout the brain are needed to
rigorously evaluate theories of neural computation at the cellular level in mammals, and extended longitudinal
recordings are required to establish general principles for neuronal circuits/dynamics and how complex
neuronal activity relates to behavior, both to further our fundamental understanding of the brain, but also to
surface underlying causes of neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, TBI,
epilepsy, and depression, and to aid development of novel and more effective treatments.
These are key goals of the BRAIN initiative, and the driving force behind LeafLabs' Willow, an
electrophysiology recording system designed to take advantage of novel, close-packed 1000-channel silicon
probes originally developed by the Synthetic Neurobiology Group at MIT. These ultra-high-channel-count
probes allow for more neurons to be recorded simultaneously, opening up new lines of scientific inquiry, and
the dense packing of the electrodes permits spatial oversampling of the neurons, allowing for automated spike
sorting techniques with greatly increased capability for tracking individual units.
Additionally, LeafLabs' Catkin, a custom 1000 channel neurosensing IC chip (filter, amplification, multiplexing,
and analog-digital conversion) has been developed to integrate with these probes, resulting in a
probe/headstage combo suitable for use in freely-moving electrophysiology experiments that reduces size,
weight, and cost each by a factor of 10 compared to commercially available headstages. Currently, the Catkin
probe/headstage combo is tethered to the Willow DAQ system by an ultra thin and lightweight cable (a single
shielded 32 AWG twisted pair), resulting in a system ideal for many prolonged freely moving experiments.
However, in certain behavioral setups, even a lightweight, minimalist cable is undesirable. For example,
because the high data rates are incompatible with approaches used to manage the cable tether
(commutators), researchers must occasionally intervene to de-tangle cables; or, the presence of a tether may
result in altered behavior from animals. To address these needs, this application proposes the development of
a first-of-its-kind fully untethered 1000-channel-simultaneous 30kHz in-vivo electrophysiological
recording module, to be made available as a lightweight add-on to the extant Willow system."
10757537,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is an ongoing global health crisis. The WHO
reports 10 million active cases and over 1.5 million deaths annually. RNA polymerase (RNAP), the enzyme
responsible for all transcription in bacteria, is the target for rifampicin, a first-line treatment for TB. RNAP is thus
a proven and attractive target for developing new drugs. These facts highlight the importance of our recent
structural and functional characterization of Mtb RNAP, and the essential transcription factors required for full
transcriptional activity and intrinsic antibiotic resistance. In addition, we have found that studying diverse clades
of bacteria deepens our understanding of general principles of transcription. Therefore, we study Actinobacteria,
as the biophysical and molecular mechanisms of transcription in this clade are relatively understudied and
because it includes important pathogens.
We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of several Mtb initiation transcription complexes with essential
transcription factors and important antibiotics in the previous funding period. Here my vision is to complete the
characterization of initiation regulation and expand our focus to the post-initiation steps throughout the
transcription cycle. These steps include elongation, pausing (a regulatory step where the RNAP temporarily halts
at specific sequences, permitting input from diverse signals), and termination. We will also continue
characterizing new RNAP inhibitors.
To complete our understanding of initiation, we will continue our studies of the WhiB factors, focusing on the
essential factor WhiB1, which is required for Mtb viability and response to stress. To characterize post-initiation
steps, we plan to study the mechanisms of mycobacterial NusA and NusG. NusG in Mycobacteria increases
transcriptional pausing and termination, yet it suppresses both in the well-characterized E. coli. This difference
in activity emphasizes the need to study these factors in other clades of bacteria. Most of these studies will
involve single-particle cryo-EM, but we plan to extend our studies in situ by using cryo-electron tomography to
investigate cellular processes and organizations, such as ribosomal coupling to RNAP. To rigorously study how
transcription factors act genome-wide, we will finish developing cell-free genomics: using genomic DNA as a
substrate for purified RNAP and transcription factors, and quantifying resultant transcripts with RNA-seq. This
method is necessary to identify native DNA sequences regulated by essential factors WhiB1, NusA, and NusG,
whose regulons have remained elusive due to pleiotropy upon perturbation in cells.
In sum, I envision using a multidisciplinary approach that includes structural, genetic, biochemical, genomic, and
in situ experiments to understand the roles and mechanisms of each step in the transcription cycle and how they
are regulated by cis and trans-acting elements. The results from this proposal have the potential to elucidate the
molecular and biological mechanisms of the entire transcription cycle."

Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in childhood. Population-based studies from around
the world report prevalence estimates ranging from 1.5 to 4 per 1000 individuals. Globally, approximately 17
million people have CP. It is a diagnosis that includes a wide range of symptoms with heterogeneous etiologies
of neural and cardiovascular origins. A wide range of functional disorders typically become obvious in CP during
early development. For example, the majority of children classified as Gross Motor Functional Classification
Scale (GMFCS) Level I are expected to reach their motor potential between 7-9 years and remain stable after
that until age 21 where they may decline due to pain, weakness and stiffness. While movements such as stepping
and posture are amongst the most recognizable impairments, absence or abnormal sensations, perception,
impaired cognition, communication skills, epilepsy, spasticity, poor control of fine movements and marked
secondary musculoskeletal problems can emerge with time. Presently, all available interventions are designed
to minimize the severity of symptoms rather than correcting the neurological etiology. Two commonly preferred
treatments, selective dorsal root rhizotomy and repetitive administration of botulinum toxin A (Botox) directly
target the neuromuscular system to counter spasticity. While these two strategies minimize some of the
disruptive movements associated with spasticity; the long-term benefits of these interventions are less clear and
both cause irreversible changes to the neuromuscular system that may be detrimental to future function. In the
present proposal we have merged ideas and concepts derived from both recent clinical observations of CP and
decades of studies of spinal cord injury to arrive at a subject-specific rehabilitation strategy driven by activity-
based mechanisms during transcutaneous spinal neuromodulation. The objectives of our neuromodulation
procedures are to amplify the plasticity of the neuromuscular system and help children gain the ability to perform
coordinated movements through activity-dependent plasticity. We hypothesized that transcutaneous spinal
neuromodulation during activity-based neurorehabilitation therapy (ABNT) can transform the neural networks in
children diagnosed with spastic CP to improve voluntary postural and locomotor activity as captured on the
GMFM88 scores. This strategy could provide a specific physiological target of fundamental significance in the
control of movement that can be used to improve function and provide new care pathways for children with CP."

supplementation to establish and maintain pregnancy. This supplementation must be administered over 8 to10
weeks of gestation until placental progesterone production is adequate to maintain pregnancy. However, current
treatment options such as vaginal gel, inserts, or IM injection, have several drawbacks and side effects that lead
to low patient compliance. In response to the critical need for improved products for sustained progesterone
supplementation, AnelleO is developing AnelleO-PRO, an intravaginal ring (IVR) delivering progesterone over
28 days to cover the entire ART treatment period (8-10 weeks) with only 2-3 rings. Progesterone supplementation
with an IVR provides a patient friendly option for controlled, sustained release of progesterone with less frequent
dosing. AnelleO’s next-generation IVR technology is based on a novel approach that applies a state-of-the-art
3D printing technology (Digital Light Synthesis, enabled by continuous liquid interface production, CLIP™) to
achieve rapid, cost-effective IVR fabrication for continuous drug release for ART and other applications. AnelleO
is applying historical lessons and previous studies on IVRs to address key gaps and needs to yield better
products. This Phase IIB project fosters progress made in Phase I and in the ongoing Phase II in an iterative,
incisive, rational design process to pave the way to an IND submission. The Specific Aims for this project are: 1)
In vivo GLP sheep safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Anelleo will engineer GLP 3D CLIP IVRs with final
design selected based on in vitro and in vivo safety data from Phases I and II, and conduct in vitro quality control
studies. This Aim also includes in vivo GLP safety and PK in sheep for GLP PRO IVR to mimic clinical study
design in human, and in vivo PK for a selected IVR design. 2) IND-enabling studies (10993 ISO testing) for the
selected IVR design. Building on FDA guidance from a pre-IND meeting and working with a regulatory team and
CDMOs/CROs, AnelleO will engineer a GLP batch of the IVR and conduct IND-enabling testing. 3) Prepare and
submit an IND application for AnelleO-PRO. Working with a regulatory team and medical/CMC/preclinical
experts, AnelleO will prepare and submit an IND application for AnelleO-PRO. This work is critical for advancing
AnelleO-PRO as a safe and equivalent or superior technology to current products used for progesterone
supplementation in ART. The pivotal sheep GLP and ISO10993 studies will establish the safety and efficacy of
our product for ART and pave the way to clinical trials and commercialization. The development of AnelleO-PRO
for sustained delivery of progesterone to cover the entire ART treatment period with only 2-3 ring administrations
will be groundbreaking, as there is no FDA approved 3D printed IVR for delivery of natural PRO for ART or any
other indication. AnelleO’s IVR platform technology will offer customizable, sustained, and controlled drug
delivery of pharmaceuticals via the vaginal route, and thus can also meet a broad range of women’s health
applications."

This R43 proposal answers the call of the RFA PA-22-176 for assay development and
chemical probe screening by addressing the unmet need for development of antiviral
treatments for Ebola patients through an innovative high-content small molecule screen
for antagonists of the Ebola VP40 matrix protein. There is a need for a fast-acting therapy
that is independent of the immune system and targets essential viral proteins. Such a
novel therapeutic is anticipated to enhance the survival probability for infected people in
hot zones of an Ebola outbreak. We chose to target EBOV VP40 because it is absolutely
required for EBOV particle assembly at the cell membrane, is capable of budding virus-
like particles (VLPs) when expressed in isolation and VP40 protein-protein interaction
domains have been structurally determined. Further guiding this application is our
published pilot screen which established proof-of-concept by demonstrating the
accessibility of Ebola VP40 protein-protein interactions to sangivamycin, a dual acting
small molecule antagonist of both EBOV VP40 assembly of virions and the viral
replication machinery. Given this success and due to anticipated complications with
efficacy and MOA studies inherent to compounds with dual targets, our Specific Aims
propose to screen a library of ~123,000 small molecule compounds to identify antagonists
of VP40 accumulation at the cell membrane for VLP formation and release from cells
through a fully automated, quantitative, and high-content assay. The assay has been
vetted to quantify the effect of small molecules on the cellular distribution of a fluorescent
VP40 expressed in 293T cells. Hits validated as dose-dependent by qHTS and displaying
low cytotoxicity will be further prioritized based on their absolute requirement for VP40 in
antiviral mechanism of action through counter screening with the VP40- independent
minigenome assay. Lead compounds also will be prioritized by their favorable ADMET
profiles. Our proposed critical path anticipates identifying 2-4 dose-dependent, VP40-
selective antagonists with potent antiviral activity that display low cytotoxicity for future
medicinal chemistry and preclinical development."

Dr. Gabriel Chamie is an infectious diseases physician and Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of
HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). His
research has focused on developing effective approaches to promote community-based diagnosis of HIV, TB
and SARS-CoV-2, and engagement in HIV and TB prevention and treatment, with a more recent focus on
persons with unhealthy alcohol use in East Africa. He has over a decade of experience mentoring numerous
early-stage investigators (ESI), including pre- and post-doctoral investigators and junior faculty, and now seeks
the protected time of a K24 award to focus greater attention and time on mentoring, mentorship training and
expanding his research program at the intersection of HIV and alcohol use. In this application, Dr. Chamie
proposes a comprehensive mentorship, mid-career development, and research plan to address the challenge
of reaching and engaging populations at increased risk of HIV in biomedical HIV prevention from alcohol
drinking venues in East Africa. Despite a growing number of efficacious biomedical HIV prevention options, a
major challenge remains reaching persons at highest risk of HIV – such as adults at alcohol drinking venues –
who do not routinely engage in medical care, to overcome barriers to HIV prevention initiation and retention,
including alcohol use. To further develop and expand his patient-oriented research (POR) program and
mentoring, he proposes mid-career training in methods that support the application of quantitative preference
elicitation and human-centered design for intervention development, and additional training in mentorship.
Leveraging the infrastructure of his recently awarded R01 (the OPAL trial) and the ongoing SEARCH-
SAPPHIRE trial, Dr. Chamie proposes research in this application to: a) elicit preferences for biomedical HIV
prevention service delivery among adults at high risk of HIV who attend drinking venues in rural Kenya and
Uganda, b) to adapt the SAPPHIRE trial’s clinic-based “dynamic PrEP/PEP choice” intervention for community-
based delivery to this population at or near drinking venues, and c) to assess uptake, retention, and adherence
to biomedical prevention in a pilot trial of community-based biomedical prevention delivery among adults who
attend or work at drinking venues in rural Kenya and Uganda. With the guidance of an experienced senior
mentorship team, Dr. Chamie will utilize multiple ongoing research projects, and long-standing research
collaborations between UCSF and Makerere University in Uganda and the Kenya Medical Research Institute in
Kenya, to provide mentees with a robust infrastructure on which to develop their research interests and support
US-East African ESI partnerships in POR. The K24 award is instrumental to supporting him in achieving his
long-term goals of becoming a global leader in HIV and alcohol use research and mentoring future leaders in
patient-oriented research from the US and East Africa."

In this application, we describe a multi-level implementation strategy to systematically improve the identification
of urinary incontinence (UI) among women seen in primary care, support patient-centered decision making for
UI, and accelerate the uptake of evidence-based nonsurgical treatment modalities for UI. We expect to
demonstrate how system-level changes aimed at improving UI care, when implemented in conjunction with a
mature quality improvement and information technology infrastructure and combined with innovative patient-
centered supports, can lead to transformative improvement.
With 65 primary care practices and 327 primary care physicians, who provide care to over 279,000 individual
women, Northwestern Medicine is the largest health system in Illinois and well suited to implement the latest
patient-centered outcomes research evidence regarding nonsurgical treatment for UI in women. Meanwhile our
trans-regional, integrated pelvic health program is already providing the full breadth of approved non-surgical
treatments for UI. The linchpin of our proposal is our unique existing partnership with Wisercare© – a company
with whom we have developed an evidence-based, shared decision-making module for UI that we will fully
integrate into the primary care provider (PCP) workflow.
Our approach begins with a set of strategies to equitably and systematically implement screening for UI on an
annual basis in primary care practices in a way that is designed to reduce the burden on PCPs. Patients who
screen positive will to learn more about UI through an online shared decision-making tool available in multiple
languages. Patients who complete the Wisercare© shared decision-making module will be able to share their
results directly with their PCP, prompting further counseling and treatment. Meanwhile, we will provide PCPs
throughout the health system with education and clinical decision support on non-surgical options for treating
UI and will use practice facilitation to onboard new workflows. The processes will be periodically audited and
screening for UI will be added to physician performance metrics.
We aim to study program impact by studying the historical under-identification of UI prior to implementing these
changes; reporting on patient treatment preferences and satisfaction with the shared decision-making process;
tracking changes in UI diagnosis, and utilization of non-surgical treatment for UI; and studying changes in PCP
comfort and support around the identification and treatment of UI. Our reliance on implementing durable
changes in care delivery should be sustainable and a model for other systems."

Resistance to our major antibiotics has been identified by the CDC as a major threat to the health and safety of
the American public. Two of the highest threat pathogens are carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
(CRAB) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Over the last decade, we have seen the emergence of novel
resistance mechanisms, limiting the utility of our best antimicrobials. This proposal answers a call to arms from
NIAID, who set forth the tool development program (RFA-AI-16-081 in 2017) to generate mechanistic insights
that can be used to create antibiotic combinations that are rationally optimized to kill CRAB and CRKP. Further,
there has been increasing awareness of organism state(s) such as tolerance/Non-Replicative Persister (NRP)
phenotype that allows evading the lethal action of antimicrobial therapy. It is important to gain insights into this
to design approaches to suppress organism entry into NRP state and, if already present, design regimens that
can eradicate NRP. We will create novel mechanistic insights and use them to rationally optimize combination
dosing strategies to synergistically kill CRAB and CRKP, and to suppress resistance. The impact of resistance
mechanisms (e.g. efflux, β-lactamases, and porin channels) and of non-essential penicillin-binding protein (PBP)
receptors on bacterial killing and resistance emergence will be studied. To optimally suppress resistance, we will
approach this problem in 4 dimensions, and consider the changes in PBP expression over time (i.e. growth
phase) and the cellular locations of these resistance mechanisms. This P01 contains 3 Projects and 3 Cores.
Project #1 will use our tools from RFA-AI-16-081 to gain insights into how different PBP binding profiles affect
killing and resistance suppression. This project will leverage the Mechanistic Assay Core and the Mathematical
Modeling Core to design optimal, clinically feasible dosage regimens. Project #2 will examine these regimens
against CRAB and CRKP isolates in the Hollow Fiber Infection Model (HFIM). In Project #3, we will study the
best regimens (and lesser regimens, as controls) from the HFIM in two murine models of pneumonia (granulocyte
replete and granulocytopenic). This will provide insights into how granulocytes can best enhance antimicrobial
therapy. The Administrative Core will serve as the overall data repository and clearing house, and facilitate
communications. The Mechanistic Assay Core will leverage transcriptomic, proteomic, flow cytometry, and resi-
stance mechanism assays, closely integrated with PBP binding studies and isogenic strains from Project #1.
This core will generate critical insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic action, resistance and synergy. Finally,
the Mathematical Modeling Core will develop high dimensional mathematical models that will integrate all experi-
mental data from the Projects and Cores to provide robust, efficacious and clinically relevant dosage regimens.
We will prospectively validate these model predictions in the HFIM (Project #2) and in normal and neutropenic
murine pneumonia models (Project #3) to support evaluation of these synergistic regimens in future clinical trials."

The overarching Aim of this proposal is to markedly improve therapeutic regimens for patients with high burden
bacterial infections like Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia (VABP) due to Carbapenem-resistant
Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP). These organisms
have been declared as being among the highest priority bacterial pathogens by the World Health Organization,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
This proposal comprises three Projects and three Cores, with the Mathematical Modeling Core being Core #3.
Translational mathematical modeling will play a critical role for this P01. Our team has had decades of experience
employing high dimensional mathematical models to generate the greatest insights into experiments where
antimicrobial therapy regimens are being sought to rapidly and completely kill pathogens while suppressing
resistance. Here we will expand our prior work substantially. In Project #1, we will create high dimensional
mathematical models from penicillin-binding protein (PBP) receptor occupancy patterns that predict the rates
and extent of killing. Mechanistic data will come from Project #1 and the Mechanistic Assay Core #2. We will
expand our datasets and mathematical models for β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors to studies at high
bacterial densities and will further assess novel non-β-lactam-PBP-binders. Previously, this work has been
performed with lysed bacteria. We now developed a novel approach where we can examine the PBP receptor
binding in intact Gram-negative bacterial cells over time. This has been paired with the ability to look at
penetration and outer membrane permeability independently. All this has already been inserted into our models.
A preliminary analysis simultaneously fit 23 β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors, as well as the 2- and 3-drug
combinations, and yielded an R2 = 0.89 in the Pre-Bayesian (population fits) step and an R2 of 0.99 in the
Bayesian (individual fits) step. We will prospectively study regimens optimized by Project 1 in the HFIM (Project
2) and in two different murine models (Project 3), one granulocyte-replete and the other granulocytopenic.
Models will include drug concentrations, total bacterial burden and less-susceptible populations for antibiotic
monotherapy regimens and combination regimens of 2, 3 or 4 drugs. In addition, mechanistic insights will be
provided by Core #2. The models that incorporate all these data will be very high dimensional. To optimize the
insights gained and provided back to all Projects, the analyses will be done in real time. As a major part of this
Mathematical Modeling Core (#3), our team is developing new algorithms to generate substantial speed-up (e.g.
Random Parametric Expectation Maximization [RPEM] and Non-Parametric Simulated Annealing [NPSA]). To
reiterate, these innovative algorithms will allow the modeling to progress in real time and inform all Projects and
Cores."

 Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection that is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and
often occurs in immunocompromised individuals including HIV/AIDS patients. Although the infection starts in
the lung via inhalation of the pathogenic fungus, the most common manifestation of cryptococcosis is
meningoencephalitis, which is a leading cause of mortality of HIV/AIDS patients and accounts for proximately
181,000 deaths worldwide annually. The high susceptibility of HIV/AIDS patients to C. neoformans infection is
attributed to their impaired cellular immunity. Consequently, C. neoformans proliferates in the brain without
control, leading to microbe-mediated brain damage. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major advance in treating
HIV/AIDS patients by restoring cellular immune responses. However, after initiation of ART, up to 30% of
HIV/AIDS patients with cryptococcosis develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), an
aberrant excessive immune response leading to host-mediated brain damage. Furthermore, post-infectious
inflammatory response syndrome (PIIRS) occurs frequently in HIV-negative patients with cryptococcal
meningoencephalitis. Therefore, a robust immune response is required for controlling the fungal growth;
however, the immune response must be tightly controlled to avoid host-mediated brain damage during
cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. A critical gap in our understanding remains: what are the mechanisms of
maintaining the balance between protective immune responses and immunopathology during cryptococcal
meningoencephalitis-associated IRIS? IL-10 is an important cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties and its
production was enhanced in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV/AIDS patients during cryptococcal IRIS. Based on
clinical data and our preliminary murine studies, we hypothesize that IL-10 is critically involved in balancing the
immune responses during cryptococcal meningoencephalitis-associated IRIS. We will test the hypothesis in a
murine model that closely mimics cryptococcal IRIS of HIV/AIDS patients, by addressing the following aims: (1)
To determine the mechanism(s) involved in regulation of the immune responses by IL-10 during cryptococcal
meningoencephalitis-associated IRIS; (2) To determine the mechanism(s) involved in induction of IL-10 in the
brain during cryptococcal meningoencephalitis-associated IRIS. If successful, the findings from this study
would be fundamental for understanding regulation of immune balance during cryptococcal
meningoencephalitis-associated IRIS and provide scientific basis for targeting this cytokine aiming at
controlling deleterious inflammation in the brain of cryptococcal IRIS/AIDS patients."

Elastin evolved in vertebrates to support a closed, pulsatile circulatory system, and was subsequently
co-opted to support reversible extension in a variety of organs, such as the lungs, viscera, and skin. It
has remarkable elastic properties supporting recoil following large strains with minimal loss of energy
over millions to billions of stretch-recoil cycles without failure. Despite its important biological and
mechanical function, the structure of the entire elastin precursor monomer (tropoelastin) and the resulting
polymer has been unknown, hampering full molecular understanding of elastin function in both health
and disease.
Our prior research has determined the shape of tropoelastin using molecular modeling of the entire
polypeptide chain, showing a matching overall shape to small-angle X-ray scattering data, and achieved
atomic resolution of the structure. We showed that the model correctly identified structural changes
associated with mutations in key molecular sites and discovered their mechanisms of impact, linking
structure to function. Furthermore, we showed that the elastic fiber network stiffens progressively with
non-enzymatic glycation. The overall goal of this proposal is to leverage these groundbreaking
preliminary results to understand the structural and molecular determinants of elastin function in arterial
tissue in health and upon aging, using an interdisciplinary experimental-modeling approach, employing
molecular and multiscale modeling, biochemical characterization, multiscale biomechanical testing, and
optical imaging within three research aims: (1) identify putative aging-associated damage sites and
establish coupling mechanisms between processes driving mechanical changes in elastin dimers, the
smallest representative molecular unit of native enzymatically crosslinked elastin; (2) determine the role
of native enzymatic and non-enzymatic (aging-linked pathological) crosslinks in modulating elastic fiber
mechanics via a mesoscale model of elastic fibers; and (3) resolve how fiber mechanics and the
propensity of crosslinking at the microscale impact elastic fiber network architecture and mechanics
during aging.
The proposed research will establish a framework to broadly investigate the multiscale structure and
multifactorial modifications associated with aging and age-related diseases that affect structural change
and mechanical function in elastic tissue. Insights gained through these studies will have a translational
impact on the development of preventative, diagnostic and reparative interventions to cardiovascular and
other age-related diseases."

Limbal stem cells (LSCs) give rise to the entire corneal epithelium and are known to reside in the border area
between the cornea and conjunctiva called limbus. Loss of LSCs or destruction of the LSC niche can result in Limbal
Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD) – a common cause of vision loss in the world. While transplantation of the autologous
limbal tissues removed from the contralateral eye can cure patients with unilateral LSCD, bilateral LSCD patients
have no autologous limbal tissues available. These patients often require transplantation of allogeneic donor limbal
grafts; however, their success is highly variable. Moreover, the worldwide corneal donor shortage poses significant
challenges for the availability of allogeneic LSCs for the treatment of bilateral LSCD patients. Thus, the overarching
goal of this project is to develop cell-free LSCD therapies through the discovery of novel mechanisms of LSC
maintenance and regeneration. Our lab has discovered an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily member B5
(ABCB5) as a novel LSC marker. ABCB5-positive LSCs isolated from human donors were capable of the long-term
corneal restoration in pre-clinical LSCD models. Clinical trials are currently on the way to address the therapeutic
potential of this stem cell population in human patients. Our most recent studies aimed to explore the cellular
hierarchy within ABCB5-positive LSCs using single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed a novel LSC subpopulation that
could be differentiated from the other LSC clusters by low expression levels of the cornea-specific genes. Here we
hypothesized that this subpopulation possesses the most primitive stem cell characteristics with the highest
regenerative potential. Further in-depth analyses revealed that these cells preferentially expressed the molecules
involved in FGF, BMP, and AXL signaling cascades. We posit that these molecular pathways are essential for the
maintenance of the undifferentiated LSC phenotype and can be employed for de-novo LSC induction and restoration
of the LSC niche in the setting of bilateral LSCD. The two Aims of this proposal will: mechanistically dissect the role
of FGF7, BMP2 and AXL in the LSC maintenance using murine and human genetically engineered experimental
models (Aim 1) and will test the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways for the treatment of LSCD in
pre-clinical murine disease models (Aim 2). Successful completion of this study will further advance our
understanding of LSC development, maintenance, and regulation with significant implications for clinical translation"
10767369,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Distinct visual features are extracted in parallel to be later combined and modulated along the visual 
pathways. Two parallel pathways can be found early on, with projections from the retina targeting the 
dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, which targets cortical areas, and the superior colliculus (SC), which 
projects to the pulvinar among other structures. These two pathways are often referred to as the primary 
and the secondary pathway respectively and are inter-connected, notably at the level of the SC. 
Importantly, visual inputs in the SC converge onto one morphologically and molecularly defined cell type: 
the wide-field vertical cells (WFV). WFV cells dendritic arborizations sample a large part of the visual field 
and we have recently shown that these cells are modulated by locomotion and receive inputs from multiple 
brain region. Their morphology and projection to the pulvinar are conserved across species. These 
observations place WFV cells as key integrators of visual and non-visual information. 
To understand how WFV cells integrate information, the investigator will perform causal experiments in 
which different sources of inputs will be manipulated in mice (Mus musculus) while the activity of WFV cells 
will be assessed using calcium imaging. This will be followed by the identification of the connectivity of the 
WFV in another animal model, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangerii), which is highly visual and closely related 
to primates. This will address the conservation of the brain-wide circuit across species, thus opening new 
alleys for translational work. To resolve existing discrepancy concerning the overall visual responses in the 
SC, the visual responses of WFV cells will be characterized in tree shrews. This particular cell-type will be 
isolated using an optogenetic approach and electrophysiological recordings, thus allowing for the 
characterization of visual response preference of these cells. This project will yield compelling results 
regarding the integration of visual information across the visual system, allow a direct comparison of the 
same defined cell-type across two species, and reveal how internal states shape visual responses in the 
SC."
10758580,"Salamanders, like newts and axolotls, can regenerate ocular tissues when injured. This is possible due to 
the ability of their pigmented epithelial cells to reprogram to retina and lens. The goal of this research is to 
unravel the reprogramming mechanism and leverage it for regenerative medicine applications. The main 
focus of the study is the ability of iris pigmented epithelial (IPE) cells to get activated, proliferate, 
reprogram, and ultimately regenerate the lens upon its complete removal. In newts, this process is 
restricted to IPE cells residing in the dorsal iris while ventral IPE cells are thought to not participate at the 
cellular level. In contrast, juvenile axolotls cannot regenerate their lens. These regenerative discrepancies 
enable the use of experimental paradigms that could provide important insights into the molecular 
mechanism of IPE reprogramming. In Specific Aim 1, a combination of comparative transcriptomics, flow 
cytometry sorting and lineage tracing will be used to identify and characterize IPE subpopulations capable 
of triggering a regenerative response. These approaches will also be paired with a novel transgenic newt 
capable of tracking changes in eye transcriptional factor dynamics during reprogramming. This will allow us 
to better understand the association between molecular and cellular changes during regeneration. In 
Specific Aim 2, functional characterization of lens regeneration will be performed. To successfully 
accomplish that, the avian RCAS/TVA system will be implemented to provide spatial and temporal control 
of target gene expression in the pigmented epithelium. The avian TVA receptor will be ubiquitously 
expressed in eye tissues, in dorsal IPE cells, or in ventral IPE cells making them susceptible to the RCAS 
retrovirus. Using this system, the effects of genes and pathways will be tested for their ability to induce 
regeneration from the ventral, or inhibit regeneration from the dorsal IPE cells, respectively. This approach 
provides a functional readout by performing necessity and sufficiency experiments. In Specific Aim 3, the 
relationship between aging, DNA damage, and regeneration potential will be explored. Newts can 
regenerate their lens from IPE cells throughout life and the ability appears unaffected by aging and 
repeated injury. First, a repeated injury model will be developed and coupled with molecular hallmarks of 
aging and DNA damage. Then, pharmacological and genetic methods will be used to study the effects of 
elevated genotoxic stress on the ability of the pigmented epithelium to reprogram to eye tissues."
10782594,"Abstract
Rickettsia is a genus of arthropod-borne pathogens responsible for typhus and spotted fever diseases. Hallmark
of Rickettsia is their reductive genome evolution, obligate intracellular lifecycle within vascular endothelial cells,
immune escape in the bloodstream, and transmission via blood-feeding arthropods, with Rickettsia replicating
in the gastrointestinal tract or salivary glands of their various vectors (e.g., lice, ticks, mites, or fleas). Recent
environmental and sociological changes have supported the invasion and expansion of arthropod vectors into
new geographical areas, prompting healthcare alerts for the increasing arthropod-borne rickettsial infections.
Owing to the technical difficulties of isolating, propagating, and genetically manipulating Rickettsia, early work
studied rickettsial virulence mechanisms by expressing target genes in heterologous organisms (such as
Escherichia coli) or characterizing rickettsial variants with different genetic backgrounds. While these studies
identified putative virulence genes, they failed to address the biological functions involved in rickettsial
pathogenesis, transmission, and host immunity against typhus and spotted fever diseases. To explore the
genetic bases of rickettsial pathogenesis, recent studies developed genetic tools for Rickettsia and characterized
rickettsial variants. These investigations characterized several Rickettsia mutants with defects in actin-based
motility, O-antigen synthesis, and cell-to-cell spread. Nevertheless, genes underpinning rickettsial entry into
vascular endothelial cells, intracellular immune evasion and replication, release and survival in the bloodstream,
or replication in various cell types of their arthropod vectors remain largely uncharacterized. This application
describes an in vitro transposition reaction using purified Tn5-transposase complexed with the kkaebi mini-
transposon, which provides for chloramphenicol selection of Rickettsia variants with single chromosomal
insertions. DNA sequencing of insertion sites demonstrates the random nature of insertional mutagenesis with
the kkaebi-transposon, while chloramphenicol-selection allows for facile isolation of variants that can be analyzed
for in vitro replication as well as defects in the pathogenesis and transmission. In the first phase (R61) of this
application, kkaebi variants will be generated using two model organisms of pathogenic Rickettsia (R. conorii
from the spotted fever group and R. typhi from the typhus group). After the successful completion of the first
phase, kkaebi variants will be characterized for phenotypic alterations using biochemical and molecular
analyses, tissue culture infections, tick infection models, and mouse infection studies. Overall, this work will
generate key experimental resources for the research community to comprehensively identify rickettsial genes
essential for pathogenesis and transmission by arthropod vectors."

This grant will investigate the optoretinogram (ORG)–an experimental, all optical assay of human photoreceptor
function–and its potential to reveal dysfunction at the cellular level. The ORG is based on adaptive optics optical
coherence tomography (AO­OCT), which is the only existing way to produce 3D images of the living human retina
with cellular resolution. It leverage our novel observation that light stimuli cause microscopic deformations in the
living photoreceptor outer segment (OS), along with OCT’s sensitivity to deformations in the tissue much smaller
than the wavelength of the imaging source. Aim 1 investigates the ORG’s ability to measure function in rods and
cones, by measuring responses in normal subjects and characterizing the signal’s sensitivity to changes in stimu­
lus energy, and factors affecting this sensitivity, such as spatial and temporal variance in response, computational
factors, and photon noise. Aim 2 investigates the mechanisms underlying light­evoked OS deformation. We will
rigorously determine the light levels at which the deformations are saturated, the effect of multiple flashes, and
the signal’s dependence on retinal eccentricity, all of which provide valuable information about the biochemical
processes causing the observed deformations. Aim 3 applies the ORG to well­characterized retinal disease, to
determine whether it is able to detect pathological dysfunction in photoreceptors suffering from known deficits.
Well­characterized deficits, in turn, offer natural experiments which may shed light on the biochemical and biome­
chanical determinants of the observed light­evoked deformations in the OS."

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) exerts a significant clinical and financial burden worldwide. Recently,
there has been increasing interest in the role of the microbiome in OSCC. Among microbial species that have
frequently been identified in association with OSCC and demonstrated to promote oral carcinogenesis, both in
vitro and in animal models, include the bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum and the fungus Candida albicans.
The two species have been demonstrated to interact via co-aggregation; however, whether such interkingdom
interaction can promote oral carcinogenesis has never been explored The current proposal builds on our
previous studies investigating the microbiome associated with OSCC and oral leukoplakia in clinical samples,
and assessing the effects of oral bacteria against oral epithelial cell lines in vitro. The proposed studies will
investigate for the first time the potentially synergistic interaction between C. albicans and F. nucleatum in
malignant progression, which we hypothesize is facilitated by their coaggregation. Based on our preliminary
data, we also hypothesize that the two species mediate part of their oncogenic properties through upregulation
of INHBA, a proposed oncogene acting through the TGF-β pathway. To address these hypotheses, we propose
to assess synergistic effects of C. albicans and F. nucleatum on normal, dysplastic, and neoplastic oral
epithelium in vitro (Aim 1), and to study the carcinogenicity of C. albicans and F. nucleatum co-carriage in 4-
nitroquinoline-1-oxide-induced OSCC mouse model (Aim 2). Combinations of wild-type, aggregation +ve strains
and mutant, aggregation-deficient strains of the two species will be used in the two aims to assess the role of
co-aggregation in promoting synergistic carcinogenicity. The involvement of INHBA upregulation in this synergy
will be investigated by mechanistic gene knockdown experiments. The project will employ a range of
technologies including cellular and biochemical assays, metatranscriptomics, histopathology,
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, q-PCR, fluorescent in-situ hybridization and 16S sequencing to
investigate the effect of treating the cell lines and mice with the test species. This innovative, exploratory study
leverages the complementary expertise of the research team to provide a first insight into the potential role of
interkingdom microbial interactions in OSCC and shed light on novel mechanisms by which C. albicans and F.
nucleatum may contribute to oral carcinogenesis"

National Science Foundation show that UR students comprised 17% of domestic enrollment in doctoral programs
in the sciences and health in the US for 2017-2020. During this time UR students represented 29% of GSBS
domestic enrollment. Coupled with a strong retention rate of UR students, our school has created a solid
foundation for PhD entry and degree completion for UR students. But we can and will do better. We have noted
disparities within our UR population impacting their success during matriculation.
In 2020, we conducted our first climate survey. While the data demonstrated overall satisfaction with the GSBS
regarding DEI issues, it also indicated opportunities for improvement, especially in building a greater sense of
community and support for UR students. To address this, in 2021 we created the Academy at the GSBS. This
program is designed to create a community of scholars and focus on the success of UR students from day one at
the GSBS. Entering Academy students participate in a prematriculation bootcamp and monthly seminars focused
on graduate school acclimation and success. While the program is less than two years old, we have already
witnessed the increased yield of UR students from offer to acceptance in the years since the Academy’s existence.
The Academy represents the basis of our T32 grant. We are proposing to expand this program to the Academy-
IMSD program, requesting eight slots with two-year appointments to train at least 24 unique trainees over five
years with a focus on cohort building for improvement of inclusion, career readiness skills in the biomedical
sciences, and enhanced access for students to explore career options. We are proposing several
courses/workshops – bioinformatics, oral presentation training, leadership opportunities, fellowship writing
and career courses, and job shadowing and internships to provide students with core technical and soft skills to
compete as next generation scientists. We believe this programming will enhance the overall environment at the
GSBS, decrease the success gap of UR to well represented students and will contribute significantly to alleviating
the disparities in the PhD biomedical workforce and to solving key scientific complexities of our time and those
to come."
10754587,"Bottom-up regulation and competition of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae along an
urbanization gradient in Puerto Rico: Effects on population performance and vector competence
 Aedes aegypti, is the primary vector of emerging arboviruses causing serious human illnesses including
yellow fever, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Species population dynamics are related to urbanization and
human density as larvae develop in man-made habitats and bloodfeed on humans. Previous studies have
independently related urbanization parameters, detrital inputs, and larval competition to some aspects of Ae.
aegypti life history (e.g., development time, biomass, fecundity) and vector competence. However, no study
has determined how urbanization can influence these ecological interactions in larval habitats, the effect that
this can have on Ae. aegypti performance across life stages, generations, and vector competence, nor have
used a nutrient stoichiometry approach to do so. Urbanization changes could translate to changes in detritus
availability and species competition in larval habitats along a gradient of urbanization which could in turn,
influence the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to dengue infection. The first objective of this proposal is to determine
the influence of urbanization on Ae. aegypti larval bottom-up effects and competition in Puerto Rico. The
second and third objectives are to assess the influence of urbanization related-detrital inputs and Aedes sp.
competition on the species life history across generations and vector competence, respectively. Preliminary
data suggests that plant detritus biomass and composition have a significant effect on Ae. aegypti larval and
adult biomass. In addition, container water nitrogen (%N) significantly increases with urbanization, that water
Carbon:Nitrogen (C:N) is significantly higher in suburban containers, and C:N exhibits a significant relationship
with Ae. aegypti larval biomass. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that urbanization influences
detrital inputs and competition in Ae. aegypti larval habitats and that this variation will affect species
performance (survival, development rate, and biomass) and dengue vector competence. A combination
of field sampling and laboratory experiments will be used to answer the objectives. Sixty larval containers will
be sampled across a gradient of urbanization in San Juan, Puerto Rico following a stratified random sampling
method with three strata (urban density): low, medium, and high. Incubated containers will simulate larval
conditions of each strata with combinations of detrital inputs and species intraspecific and interspecific
competition. Aedes aegypti females will be infected with a dengue blood meal to determine virus dissemination
and transmission rates. Nutrient analysis (i.e., %C %N, C:N) will be performed on container water, detritus,
larvae, and adults from field and laboratory experiments. The results of this research have relevance to vector
ecology, vector control strategies, arbovirus diseases, and public health."

 The fetal/neonatal period represents a unique period of vulnerability to viral infections. While
Herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) are highly prevalent and typically non life-threatening
infections among healthy adults, they are among the most consequential viral infections of early life. HSV
infection during parturition or the early postnatal period results in disseminated disease or encephalitis in up to
50% of infected newbowns. Without treatment, mortality is high and an estimated 70% of surviving infants with
central nervous system (CNS) involvement suffer long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae despite aggressive
treatment with acyclovir. Fortunately, newborns in our pathogen-rich world inherit some of the protection provided
by the maternal immune system in the form of transferred antibodies (Ab). For HSV, maternal Ab seropositivity,
resulting in placental transfer of Ab capable of directly neutralizing virus and eliciting the diverse effector functions
of the innate immune system, is associated with dramatically decreased risk of nHSV.
 There is no currently approved HSV vaccine whereby maternal Abs could be induced among
seronegative mothers. As an alternative, our previous work has demonstrated that maternal Ab readily accesses
neural tissues of the fetus and is sufficient to prevent nHSV. Preliminary data now demonstrate a novel mouse
model system whereby we can model not only mortality and viral burden, but also behavioral pathologies that
are frequent and lifelong in humans following nHSV. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
development of effective vaccines and therapeutic antibodies for nHSV infections will benefit from careful in vivo
and in vitro evaluation of antibody mechanism(s) of action. Presently, there is a critical gap in knowledge of the
mechanisms whereby Ab-based interventions provide benefit in the context of nHSV infection, and how these
interventions might be optimized in order to best prevent this devastating disease.
 Our objective is to define and refine the means by which monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be used
to prevent or reduce nHSV morbidity and mortality. We hypothesize that while Ab effector functions contribute
to direct neutralization activity, they are modulated by the viral Fc Receptor (vFcR), glycoprotein E (gE/gI
complex). Guided by strong preliminary data, the project goals will be achieved though completion of two
Specific Aims: 1) Define the mechanism(s) of action of mAbs that prevent nHSV, and 2) Define the role of the
viral Fc receptor (gE/gI) in influencing antiviral mAb activity."

Objectives. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop chemically specific electrochemical sensors to provide
rapid and direct measurements of physiologically relevant chemical messenger release (technology development). The
secondary objective is to apply these sensors to determine signaling heterogeneity in astrocytes from different brain regions
(biological hypothesis).
Significance and Knowledge Gap. Astrocytes act as integrators across many circuits and environments in the brain and
how they interact with other cell types can vary in time and space. Rigorous prior research demonstrates that astrocytes are
heterogenous, varying by brain region and circuit. Heterogeneity can be affected by transcriptional control related to synapse
function, plasticity, molecular transmission and protein machinery and organelles that underly gliotransmission. Astrocyte
heterogeneity also affects how this class of cells respond to insults and age and can potentially be predictive of disease
vulnerability. Astrocytes have typically been studied as a homogenous population, thus there is a need to study functional
heterogeneity of astrocytes (e.g., signaling) to determine functional roles of astrocytes in development, response to injuries,
and neurodegenerative disease and how this response influences local circuit function and homeostasis.
Solution and Specific Aims. A major barrier to studying gliotransmission is the lack of measurement tools that possess the
combined spatiotemporal and chemical specificity to study dynamic molecular signaling from astrocytes. We aim to develop
a sensor platform that overcomes this barrier by providing direct and rapid measurement of gliotransmission over broad
spatial and temporal ranges. Through a collaborative proposal we propose to leverage the universal and specific chemical
detection abilities of electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors with innovative measurement science for rapid
determination of gliotransmitter dynamics and heterogeneity. With this new measurement technology, we aim to test the
hypothesis that gliotransmitter signaling varies in terms of the frequency, amount, and identity of transmitters released with
circuit-, and inter- and intraregional specificity. We will 1) Develop electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors to
monitor real-time release of gliotransmitters from a cell population in 3D culture. 2) Develop recessed, microscale E-AB
sensors to monitor the release of gliotransmitters from single astrocytes. 3) Develop recessed, nanoscale sensors to monitor
the release of gliotransmitters from sub-cellular regions. 4) Select and characterize highly specific structure-switching
nucleic acid aptamers as binding partners for glutamate, GABA, and D-serine with nM affinity for use in aims 1-3."
10754505,"Abstract/ Summary
Recent studies assessing the immune phenotypes and functionality of septic patients have increased our
understanding of the immune dysregulation that occurs during sepsis. The new paradigm suggests that the
balance of T cell costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules is critical to determining the outcome of T cell
activation and/or dysregulation during sepsis. One costimulatory molecule that is most critical to T cell
activation is CD28. CD28 is a potent costimulatory receptor and on naïve T cells is a required secondary signal
that promotes optimal T cell activation. CD28 has been shown to be down-regulated during sepsis on CD4+
and CD8+ T cells in both mice and humans. These expression data have led to the supposition that CD28
down-regulation may contribute to immune suppression following sepsis. However, the functional role of CD28
during sepsis is controversial, as other studies have shown a protective effect of CD28 blockade in several
murine models of sepsis. Of note, CD28 is differentially expressed on naïve vs. memory T cells. Moreover,
even memory T cells which retain CD28 expression may have reduced dependence on CD28 signaling for
activation. This is important because memory T cells constitute roughly 50% of the human T cell compartment
by the time most people reach adulthood but are much less frequent (<5%) in laboratory mice. Thus, we
hypothesized that the conflicting reports and unclear role of CD28 during sepsis may be due to a differential
role on memory vs. naïve T cells. In order to test this hypothesis and better model the antigen-experienced
immune system of human patients, during the last funding cycle we developed a model to generate mice that
possess a memory T cell compartment more similar to that of adult humans, that could then be rendered
septic. This work was recently published in JCI Insight. Briefly, naïve animals were sequentially infected with
different acutely cleared bacterial and viral infections. This approach generates a mouse with ~20% CD4+ and
~60% CD8+ memory T cells, but the actual infections are completely resolved and no virus/ bacteria are
detectable beyond day ~38, thus mitigating any impact of persistent infection. Mice then undergo cecal ligation
and puncture (CLP). Compellingly, our preliminary data reveal a striking but opposite effect of CD28 blockade
on sepsis-induced mortality in the naïve vs. memory models. While treatment of naïve laboratory animals with
anti-CD28 resulted in an increase in mortality, treatment of antigen-experienced “memory mice” with anti-
CD28 resulted in a significant decrease in mortality as compared to untreated memory controls. Here, we
propose to interrogate the mechanisms by which inhibition of CD28-mediated costimulatory signals protects
“memory mice” but not naïve laboratory animals from death during sepsis. These studies are significant and
highly clinically relevant because they will facilitate the development of immunomodulatory strategies to target
the CD28 pathway on physiologically relevant cell types in order to prevent death in septic human patients."

Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which frequently occurs in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), correlates with poor patient survival. However, therapies targeting EGFR
in multimodality therapy for HNSCC have not significantly improved outcomes for advanced stage disease.
Therefore, alternative approaches targeting EGFR and associated critical pathways are needed to combat
HNSCC, the sixth most diagnosed cancer worldwide. Our previous research identified microRNA-27a* (miR-
27a*; miR-27a-5p) as a regulator of EGFR, protein kinase B (AKT1), and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). All these proteins are commonly upregulated in cancer cells, likely as a consequence of tumors
repressing miR-27a* expression, and provide a cell survival advantage. Furthermore, re-introduction of miR-
27a* into tumor cells in vitro and in vivo causes apoptosis, raising the exciting prospect that by simultaneously
targeting multiple oncogenic pathways, miR-27a* may be an effective therapy for HNSCC. Accordingly,
our long-term clinical translational objective is to develop miR-27a* as an effective multimodality therapeutic
option for HNSCC, which is directly relevant to the mission of the NIDCR “…to improve oral, dental, and
craniofacial health through research...”. This requires us to understand the functional role of miR-27a* targets,
to define novel therapeutic combinations that enhance the ability of miR-27a* to inhibit HNSCC progression, and
to develop an approach to translate miR-27a* into the clinical arena. Currently, a knowledge gap exists regarding
validated targets of miR-27a* and the pathways they influence in HNSCC progression, as well as combinatorial
treatments that could augment miR-27a* anti-tumor effects. Moreover, methods for tumor-specific delivery of
miRs are lacking. Accordingly, we will comprehensively test the potential of miR-27a* in conjunction with
established and novel combinatorial agents for HNSCC treatment using in vitro and orthotopic in vivo tumor
models. To overcome challenges in the delivery of miRs in vivo, we will use a novel ultrasound-targeted
microbubble delivery platform to administer miR-27a* specifically to tumor. The overall objective of this proposal
is to determine the role of miR-27a* in modulating biological processes through regulation of its target genes,
while leveraging these and previous findings towards the therapeutic use of miR-27a* within the context of
current standard of care and future combinatorial treatment regimens. Our central hypothesis is that re-
introduction of miR-27a* in HNSCC negatively modulates critical oncogenic drivers to promote tumor
apoptosis. We propose three Specific Aims: (1) To confirm direct molecular targets of miR-27a* that mediate
HNSCC pathogenesis; (2) To define miR-27a*-combinatorial treatment regimens for HNSCC; and (3) To
characterize the role of miR-27a* delivery in enhancing current and future multimodality treatment regimens for
HNSCC. The findings will significantly impact our understanding of miR-27a* targets, the processes they
regulate, their role in tumor progression, and ultimately inform clinical implementation of miR-27a* therapy."
10755306,"Na+ channels are highly clustered at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) deep in the junctional folds below
acetylcholine receptors (AchRs). Whereas AchRs respond to the release of acetylcholine from the motor
neuron and are responsible for the initial membrane depolarization, the clustered Na+ channels are
responsible for the muscle action potential. AchR clustering depends on a combination of agrin, neuregulin,
and activity dependent mechanisms that have been described in great detail. However, little is known about
the mechanisms responsible for NMJ Na+ channel clustering. Diseases including myotonia, periodic paralysis,
and myasthenic syndrome all disrupt the NMJ. Na+ channel clustering occurs at two other locations in the
nervous system including nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments (AIS). Here, both cytoskeletal and
extracellular interactions participate in channel clustering and the mechanisms have been described in detail.
Remarkably, many of the same proteins involved in Na+ channel clustering at nodes and AIS are also found at
the NMJ. By analogy to nodes and AIS, we propose that NMJ Na+ channel clustering depends on similar
cytoskeletal and extracellular interactions. Aim 1 will consist of two parts designed to determine the
cytoskeletal interactions important for NMJ Na+ channel clustering. First, we will conditionally knockout
(specifically in skeletal muscle) the three Na+ channel-binding ankyrins (Ank1-3) singly and in combination.
Second, we will conditionally knockout the 4 different spectrins known to be expressed in muscle and that are
thought to link ankyrins (and Na+ channels) to the actin cytoskeleton. In both ankyrin and spectrin deficient
mice we will evaluate muscle function and Na+ channel clustering. In Aim 2 we will identify the extracellular
interactions that participate in NMJ Na+ channel clustering. First, we will generate muscle-specific knockouts
of the cell adhesion molecule Nfasc given its location at the NMJ and its important role mediating extracellular
interactions at the AIS and nodes. Second, since much less is known about the cell adhesion molecules and
extracellular matrix molecules that may underlie NMJ extracellular interactions, we will use proximity
biotinylation methods and proteomics to identify these proteins. We will then validate potential candidates
for their localization to the NMJ, and using gain and loss of function strategies determine their functions. The
aims proposed here will dramatically improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling Na+
channel clustering at the neuromuscular junction and may lead to important insights into the pathophysiology
of neuromuscular diseases and neuropathies where NMJs degenerate or function is compromised."

Emotional behaviors, such as defensive responses to threat, are often dysregulated in mental
illness. Currently, there is a poor understanding of the neural mechanisms that control transitions
between modes and magnitudes of defensive responding. Obtaining such knowledge will provide
significant progress toward the long-term goal of providing foundational knowledge used for the
development of better therapeutics for mental illness. The overall objective of this application is
to identify how distributed neuronal circuits control transitions to active forms of defensive behav-
ior. The central hypothesis is that a widespread brain network that includes the central amygdala
(CEA), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), periaqueductal grey (PAG), insular cortex (IC), and
ventral hippocampus (vHIPP) controls defensive response transitions. The rationale that under-
lies this proposal is that an enhanced understanding of these complex behavioral states and cir-
cuits will provide foundational data for understanding multiple psychiatric disorders and their
comorbidity. The proposed research tests the central hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Iden-
tify the functional role of specific projection pathways in defensive action selection; 2) Determine
the impact of structures afferent to the CEA on flight behavior; and 3) Define the neuronal activity
patterns that encode shifts in defensive states from freezing to flight to panic. The first aim will
use viral vector delivery strategies and optogenetics to target and manipulate specific output path-
ways of the CEA. The second aim will use retrograde targeting strategies to manipulate afferents
to the CEA. Finally, the third aim will use deep-brain calcium imaging to monitor neural activity
patterns in specific populations of projection neurons while mice transition through escalating lev-
els of defensive responding. Successful completion of the proposed research will define mecha-
nisms by which widespread brain networks mediate switching to active modes of defensive be-
havior. The proposed research is innovative because it substantially departs from the status quo
by investigating how the brain coordinates transitions between defensive behaviors. This will be
significant because it will lay a foundation that facilitates understanding of the neuronal circuit
basis of the maladaptive responses associated with mental illness. Indeed, this novel systems
neuroscience approach to understanding how fear states are encoded will open new avenues of
research into the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety- and trauma-related mental health dis-
orders, such as posttraumatic stress and panic disorder."

Human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inconsistent response to therapies and persistent
activation of pathogenic effector CD4+ T cells implying regulatory T cell (Treg) dysfunction; however, the
underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, the OVERALL OBJECTIVE of this proposal is to
elucidate the mechanisms by which gastrointestinal cues impact Treg metabolism and function with the
therapeutic goal of defining pharmacological and adoptive Treg therapies to treat IBD. For the first time using
complementary approaches, we have observed a defined mitochondrial ultrastructure (shape, cristae structure,
and physical interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum [ER]) which correlated with Treg metabolic state. We
are now poised to exploit how: i) mitochondrial ultrastructure and its associated metabolic state in Tregs
suppress gut inflammation in various mouse models of experimental colitis; and ii) a breakdown in the
regulation and function of mitochondrial ultrastructure can drive human IBD pathogenesis by analyzing Tregs
from peripheral blood and lamina propria of IBD patients compared to relevant healthy individuals. Our
preliminary data suggest that anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) cytokine is a critical
driver of mitochondria-ER contact (MERC) in Tregs via its associated molecular architecture, thus implicating
intact MERC and subsequent pyruvate oxidation in Treg-mediated suppression of IBD. In our preliminary
experimentations mimicking the proinflammatory milieu of IBD gastrointestinal tract, treatment of Tregs with
proinflammatory cytokines impaired MERC and perturbed glucose metabolism, leading to excessive fatty acid
oxidation as a compensatory mechanism in contrast to vehicle-treated Tregs (“proinflammatory cytokine-
induced metabolic reprogramming”). Furthermore, we discovered that proinflammatory cytokine-induced
metabolic reprogramming of Tregs was reversed by inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase 3 beta (GSK3β)
using a class of inhibitors currently being explored in clinical trials for other indications. Based on these novel
observations, we formulated the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that TGF-β1 mediates mitochondria-ER contact
that is essential for cellular metabolic homeostasis, Treg function, and suppression of IBD pathogenesis. The
following independent SPECIFIC AIMS are designed to test three integrated hypotheses. First, we will directly
test the hypothesis that TGF-β1 mediates MERC and consequently Treg function. Second, we will test the
hypothesis that TGF-β1 potentiates mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation and consequently Treg function. Third,
we will test the hypothesis that proinflammatory cytokines perpetuate IBD pathogenesis in vivo via MERC
inhibition. We propose to utilize sophisticated approaches relevant to health and IBD pathophysiology to test
this hypothesis. This proposal, which is technically and conceptually innovative, is also significant because it
presents a novel concept in Treg biology and identifies new mechanisms for therapeutically optimizing Tregs,
namely combining pharmacological and Treg-based therapies, to halt the refractory nature of IBD."

 Trypanosoma brucei causes human sleeping sickness and sequentially expresses immunologically distinct
Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs), its major surface antigen, to evade the host’s immune response and
establish a long-term infection. VSG is transcribed one at a time (in a monoallelic manner) from regions next to
the chromosome end termed telomere. Parasites that express more than one type of VSG are more quickly
eliminated by the host. Therefore, monoallelic expression (MAE) of VSG genes is critical for parasite survival.
We have shown that T. brucei RAP1, a telomere protein, is essential for telomere integrity, hence parasite
proliferation, and VSG MAE. In order for RAP1 to execute these roles, its ability to bind dsDNA is essential but
not sufficient. We hypothesize that a high concentration of telomere-localized RAP1 is required. Since RAP1
interacts with TRF that specifically binds the telomeric DNA, we hypothesize that this interaction helps enrich
RAP1 at the telomere. We will test this by examining RAP1 chromatin association profile in WT and RAP1
mutants defective of RAP1-TRF interaction or DNA binding. VSG MAE has two key aspects: silencing all but
one VSG genes in the T. brucei genome and sustaining high-level expression of the only active VSG, both
depending on RAP1. On one hand, RAP1 helps compact the telomeric chromatin, which is critical for VSG
silencing, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We found that RAP1 is essential for normal level
expression of H3v, a histone variant enriched at the telomere and important for complete VSG silencing. RAP1
also interacts with FYRP, a subunit of the chromatin remodeler ISWI that is important for VSG silencing.
Therefore, we hypothesize that the RAP1-H3v/FYRP interactions play important roles in RAP1-mediated VSG
silencing. We will determine the interfaces of these interactions and examine VSG silencing status in RAP1
mutants defective of these interactions. On the other hand, we found that unlike vertebrate and yeast RAP1
homologs, T. brucei RAP1 has an RRM domain that mediates its binding to the active VSG RNA in vivo.
Intriguingly, RAP1’s RNA and DNA binding activities compete with each other in a substrate concentration-
dependent manner. At the active VSG locus, RAP1’s binding to the highly concentrated active VSG RNA
effectively blocks its binding to local dsDNA and disrupts the RAP1-mediated silencing, enabling high-level
expression of the active VSG. However, exactly what RNA sequences can be recognized by RAP1 and how
RAP1 specifically regulates VSG MAE is unknown. We will characterize the properties of RAP1’s RNA binding
activity using both in vivo iCLIP approach and several in vitro approaches including gel shift, NMR titration,
RNA toeprinting and RNase footprinting. Our studies on RAP1 helps build a comprehensive view of RAP1’s
pleiotropic functions and will venture into a new paradigm for better understanding mechanisms of antigenic
variation in T. brucei. Investigating essential activities uniquely found in kinetoplastid RAP1 homologs will also
benefit development of better treatments of infections caused by kinetoplastid parasites including T. brucei."

 Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease. Although largely
preventable, ECC affects one third of socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority preschool
children in the US. Effectively reducing ECC disparity requires a better understanding of its biological factors
from birth to early childhood including identifying differential exposure to risk factors by race and socioeconomic
status. While ECC is an infectious disease initiated by the oral microbiota (bacteria and fungi), the interplay
between host, environment, and oral microbiota affects the onset and severity of ECC. However, to date, few
studies have examined the early-life longitudinal development of oral microbiota in underserved children, and
none have utilized comprehensive methods to examine multiplatform (host and environmental) factors that
contribute to the establishment of cariogenic microflora and onset of ECC among the underserved children.
 Oral Microbiome in Early Infancy (OMEI) study will address this urgent need to understand
biological factors related to ECC among underserved racial/ethnic minority groups. The OMEI leverages
a recently archived birth cohort that compromises 160 low-income minority infants (primarily Black/African
American) and a comprehensive collection of medical/oral health records and ~1760 salivary/supragingival
samples (obtained via NIDCR KL2TR001999 and K23DE027412, PI: Xiao). The OMEI builds upon our previous
work that 1) revealed racial background is associated with early-life oral microbiome development in the context
of ECC; 2) demonstrated oral bacterial-fungal cross-kingdom interactions and their associations with ECC; 3)
identified human genes related to Host-S. mutans-Dental caries interactions; and 4) developed machine-learning
prediction models for ECC. In Aim 1, we will use metagenomic analysis to define the critical assembly and
functional development of the oral microbiome (bacteria and fungi) in early infancy (birth to two years) among all
infants and their respective racial groups. In Aim 2, we will use computational modeling to identify determinants
(maternal, genetic, and immune factors) of infants’ oral microbiome development. In Aim 3, we will use high-
dimensional statistical machine learning approaches to integrate multi-platform (maternal, microbial, genetic,
immune, and environmental) data to identify biological factors underlying ECC etiopathogenesis and develop
ECC prediction models. The OMEI will be the first study that examines the early-life biological factors underlying
ECC disparity from an infants’ oral microbiome perspective. Risk factors revealed from OMEI could be used as
targets for ECC early prediction and prevention specifically suitable for underserved children. An integrated
health disparities research team with investigators from multiple disciplines (microbiome, perinatal oral health,
metagenomic sequencing, high-dimensional biostatistics, genetics, and health disparities), together with an
outstanding internal-external advisory committee, will ensure the success of the proposed OMEI project."

The initiation and progression of obesity-related diseases is strongly associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, and the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key sensor that instigates inflammation in obesity. Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation should curb or prevent the disease progression and thus holds therapeutic promise to combat obesity-related diseases. However, effective and safe strategies that specifically inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in obesity have not been developed for patient treatment. As such, the long- term goal of our research is to develop a new dietary strategy or therapeutic modality to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inflammation in obesity and obesity-related diseases. As an initial step, this project will define the role of chive-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (C-ELNs) in suppressing inflammation in obesity. Our pilot studies found that C-ELNs strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in primary macrophages. One of their bioactive molecules, 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glcyero-3-phosphocholine, was identified as an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Oral administration of C-ELNs, started concomitantly with high-fat diet feeding, reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activity and improved metabolic health in the C57BL/6J mice. Building on our preliminary work, this project will test the central hypothesis that C-ELNs contain active biomolecules that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity and ameliorate inflammation in obesity. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) identify active biomolecules in C-ELNs that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity and 2) define the role of C-ELNs and their active biomolecules in suppressing inflammation in obesity. Successful completion of the proposed research be the first step toward the translation of C-ELNs and active biomolecules into an intervention to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inflammation in obesity. Utilizing dietary ELNs to target the NLRP3 inflammasome is an innovative approach. The unique features of dietary ELNs, including tissue bioavailability, bioactivity, and biomolecule protection and delivery, as well as their abundance in edible plants confer upon them high translational potential."

Despite their important role in birth defects and infant mortality, the 3-D and 4-D patterning
processes that employ multiple signals to drive embryonic development and morphogenesis are
not mechanistically understood. The long-term goal is to obtain a complete molecular description
of 4-D pattern formation, using the simple yet relevant sea urchin larval skeleton as a model. The
central objective in this application is to define a model that captures how the ectoderm expresses
different patterning cues in different regions over space and time using systems biology
approaches, to integrate that network with our spatiotemporal patterning cue reception network
in the responsive skeletogenic cells, then use that network model to identify the underlying
general principles for spatiotemporal deployment of and response to patterning instructions. The
main hypothesis is that differential spatiotemporal expression of the set of signals that regulate
skeleton formation is the central driver of embryonic pattern formation and is hard-wired into the
ectodermal gene regulatory networks that regulate skeletal patterning, while the reception of
those cues drives the spatiotemporal diversification of the skeleton-producing PMCs that in turn
mediate morphogenesis. The expected outcomes are (i) a validated single-cell level set of
interconnected spatiotemporal network models that define the presentation and reception of
patterning cues between the relevant tissues and (ii) computational models that capture the
overall network and that will allow rigorous analysis of the networks' functions. The research
proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it utilizes novel
analytical approaches and tools developed by the applicant's group, including a novel scRNA-seq
data analysis algorithm, a new tool for automated 3-D mapping of skeletogenic cells from confocal
image stacks, and polychrome skeletal labeling for post-hoc dynamics analysis. The proposed
research is significant because will establish a highly resolved molecular map of a 4-D
developmental process for skeletal patterning that will offer insight into the general principles that
underlie complex pattern formation. Because of the conservation of many of the relevant
patterning cues between sea urchin and human skeletons, this knowledge may ultimately lead to
new approaches for the prevention or treatment of skeletal birth defects and new strategies for
synthetic biomineral production."

 A broadly distributed means of bacterial gene regulation is an mRNA element called a riboswitch. These
cis-acting elements are found in the 5′-leader regions and regulate expression through their ability to directly
bind a specific cellular metabolite with a highly structured receptor called the aptamer domain. Metabolite binding
is then communicated to a downstream secondary structural switch in the expression platform that instructs the
expression machinery. Genes that are essential for survival or virulence are regulated by riboswitches in
numerous medically important pathogens, making riboswitches attractive and novel targets for antimicrobial
therapeutics. A long-term goal of my Research Program is to develop a molecular understanding of how mRNA
interacts with small molecules and how these interactions drive biological processes. These overarching
questions include: (1) How does RNA create small molecule binding pockets that recognize a spectrum of
compounds with high affinity and varying degrees of specificity? (2) How can structural plasticity be exploited to
by RNA-targeting compounds? (3) What are the mechanisms by which ligand binding drive changes in RNA
structure to effect gene regulation? To address these questions, we will use a combination of structural,
biophysical, and biochemical approaches as well as in vitro and cell-based functional assays.
 As our Research Program has developed a detailed understanding of RNA-small molecule interactions,
we have begun to leverage this knowledge towards the design of research tools that facilitate basic research
and therapeutic application. In this proposal, we are developing novel platforms for tagging RNAs with
fluorophores for imaging in live mammalian cells, removing a technical barrier that has limited the study of RNA
function. Specifically, we hypothesize that the robust folding and ligand binding properties of riboswitch aptamer
domains will provide superior imaging performance over in vitro selected aptamers in cells. Thus, we are
developing a set of riboswitch-based tags that bind modular chemical probes and a set of approaches to assess
and benchmark their performance in mammalian cells.
 Recently, we launched a new direction in our Research Program to investigate how classical transcription
factors (TFs) interact with the transcriptome as part of their regulatory function. We demonstrated that Sox2, a
pioneer TF critical for maintenance of pluripotency and neural differentiation, directly interacts with RNA in mouse
embryonic stem cells and binds various RNAs in vitro with affinities that rival its consensus DNA promoter site.
We observed similar RNA interactions for other Sox and TCF/LEF family proteins, suggesting that RNA binding
may be a general property of HMGB proteins that is critically linked to their function. In this proposal, we seek to
extend these initial findings to address a set of key questions: (1) What is the full spectrum of RNAs bound by
Sox2? (2) How does RNA binding impact chromosomal localization? (3) What is the structural basis for RNA
recognition by HMGB proteins?"

The translation of mRNAs into protein is a fundamental step in gene expression that is regulated
by diverse cellular signals. How these regulatory mechanisms are used to orchestrate changes
in gene expression and cellular function remains poorly understood. We have been studying this
question through examination of the mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, a master
regulator of growth throughout eukaryotes. This pathway senses nutrient signals and responds
by activating the cellular biosynthesis machinery to drive growth. Deregulation is linked to
human diseases ranging from cancers to neurological disorders. A central function of mTORC1
is to activate “cap-dependent” translation through the eIF4F translation factor. Over the past five
years, my laboratory has shown how this mechanism is used to control the translation and
stability of hundreds of mRNAs with essential growth functions, including nearly all ribosomal
proteins. More recently, we identified hundreds of mRNAs that are hyper-dependent on cap-
dependent translation for unknown reasons and thousands that access “cap-independent”
initiation mechanisms that remain unclear. Going forward, our research program seeks to
answer several basic questions that emerge from these observations. First, what mRNA
features define dependence on cap-dependent and cap-independent translation mechanisms
and how are they detected? Second, how does regulation of cap-dependent translation trigger
global and specific changes in mRNA stability? Third, how does variation in the structure of the
transcriptome (e.g. alternative promoters) specialize the post-transcriptional regulation of
mRNAs across tissues in vivo? We propose to tackle these questions using a combination of
transcriptomic strategies, massively parallel reporter assays, and bioinformatic analyses in cells
and in vivo that we have established over the last five years. Our ultimate goal is to fully
understand the molecular systems that control growth-regulated gene expression, establish
their function in the cellular growth process, and link their function to growth-related physiology.
We expect these efforts to yield insights into basic principles of gene regulation that are used to
adapt cells and organisms to changing nutrient availability."
10766744,"Pediatrichigh-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer, with a median
survival (MS) of ~18 months 1,2. The current standard of care for pHGG, consisting of tumor resection followed
by radiation and chemotherapy, elicits only a modest increase in MS 1-4. The main reasons for the limited
therapeutic outcomes are tumor recurrence, caused by the infiltrative nature of pHGG, and the development of
an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). One of the main subtypes of hemispherical pHGG
encodes for G34R/V substitutions in the histone H3F3A 4, along with ATRX and TP53 inactivating mutations.
The investigation of the molecular pathways which play a role in the pathogenesis of pHGG requires accurate
mouse models which recapitulate the salient features of pHGG and develop within the brain's microenvironment
in an immune-competent host. Our lab created genetically engineered immune competent pHGG mouse models
employing the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase system 5,6. Tumors harbor genetic lesions encountered in a
subtype of pHGG, i.e., H3.3G34R co-expressed with ATRX and TP53 knock down. The host in this pHGG model
exhibits an intact immune system, thus enabling detailed mechanistic studies on all aspects of pHGG biology
in vivo, including interactions with the TME immune cells. Our preliminary RNA-Seq data on H3.3-G34R versus
H3.3-Wt pHGG revealed downregulation of gene ontologies (GO) related to DNA Damage Response (DDR)
in H3.3-G34R pHGG. We also observed upregulation of GOs related to the activation of the immune
response, such as “Regulation of Immune Response” and “Type I Interferon Production”, in the H3.3-G34R
pHGG model. Herein we propose to determine the cellular andmolecular mechanisms by which H3.3-G34R
regulates the response to radiotherapy and DDR inhibition in mouse and human H3.3G34R pHGG cells in vitro
and in vivo. We aim to elucidate the role played by H3.3-G34R in DNA repair processes, responseto DNA
damaging agents, and in TME immune cells' reprogramming. We propose to test the hypothesis that H3.3G34R
reshapes the epigenetic landscape, resulting in alterations in chromatin states and transcriptional changes.
These alterations cause DDR impairment and induce genomic instability, which in turn leads to cGAS-STING-
Pathway-mediated activation of the immune system within the H3.3G34R pHGG TME. We will assess
chromatin states by ATAC-seq, and establish whether reduced chromatin accessibility impairs DNA repair
in G34R pHGG. We will also evaluate whether genomic instability in G34R pHGG mediates the immune system
activation via cGAS-STING. We will also define at the molecular level the phenotypically diverse tumor and
infiltrating immune cell clusters within the H3.3-G34R pHGG microenvironment using scRNA-seq; this will allow
us to uncover mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. This information, will enable uncovering genetic makeup-
tailored therapeutic modalities for H3.3-G34R pHGG, such as cell cycle checkpoint or DDR inhibitors
combined with radiotherapy."

Hypomorphic variants of the Immunity Related GTPase (IRG) M gene are associated with poor outcomes for
sepsis patients; however, the underlying mechanism is not known. IRGM and its mouse orthologues are
produced at high levels in response to LPS and/or interferons, particularly in macrophages. Although prior work
has shown that IRGM proteins bind intracellular membranes and modulate immune responses that restrict
survival of intracellular pathogens, their primary roles in inflammation - independent of their roles in cell-
autonomous host defense - are mostly unexplored. As instructed by extensive preliminary data, this proposal
will address the novel hypothesis that IRGM proteins directly downmodulate the production of inflammatory
cytokines in response to LPS, and that they do so through at least two distinct mechanisms: (1) by shaping
metabolic pathways that regulate activation of the extracellular LPS sensor TLR4, and (2) by modulating
intracellular processing of ingested LPS to limit activation of the cytosolic LPS sensor Casp11 (CASP4). We will
test these two non-exclusive mechanisms by which IRGM proteins dampen pro-inflammatory signaling in mouse
and human macrophages in vitro, as well as define the roles of IRGM proteins in sepsis and antimicrobial
inflammation in vivo. Aim1 will determine the impact of IRGM proteins on mitochondrial function, metabolite
levels, glucose metabolism, and cytokine production in response to TLR4 activation. Causation between altered
metabolism and/or mitochondrial function and altered cytokine expression will be established through
pharmacological and genetic interventions. Aim2 will explore the role of IRGM proteins in the processing and
sensing of cytoplasmic LPS and define the mechanism(s) by which IRGM deficiencies lead to LPS-triggered
Casp11 hyperactivation. Aim3 will determine how changes in IRGM protein function impact TLR4- and /or
Casp11-dependent sepsis in vivo. Instructed by our finding that IRGM insufficiency leads to excessive
inflammatory cytokine production to LPS in vivo, we will define the consequences of IRGM protein insufficiencies
on morbidity and survival in clinically relevant sepsis mouse models. Newly generated conditional Irgm knockout
models and a pan-Irgm knockout mouse will be used to determine cell-specific roles for Irgm proteins and the
interdependent functions of Irgm isoforms. Collectively, our studies will not only provide a mechanistic
understanding of IRGM proteins as negative regulators of LPS-activated proinflammatory signaling pathways
but also define the relevance of these regulatory processes in determining the outcome of different sepsis
subtypes."
10767290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Some of the most challenging diagnostic cases involve patients who present with complex phenotypes that
evolve over time and intersect multiple medical disciplines. The two primary clinical settings for diagnosing such
patients are undiagnosed disease clinics and neonatal intensive care unit rapid genome sequencing programs.
These clinics have adopted an approach where diagnostic analysis is based on comprehensive genomic
sequencing data; and analysis is carried out by a large, collaborative clinical team. This team-based
approach leverages the treating physician’s detailed understanding of the patient’s phenotype, the medical
geneticist’s deep knowledge of genetic diseases, the bioinformatic analyst’s expertise in adjudicating a variant’s
quality and predicted pathogenicity, as well as the diagnostic pathologist’s ability to synthesize all relevant
information and reach a conclusion regarding a given variant’s clinical significance. Diagnostic analysis of
patients in both of these environments is a long-term process that often continues for months or even years,
until new phenotypes in the patient are observed or novel gene-disease associations are reported in the literature
that provide the necessary insight for case solution. However, existing software tools typically only cater to the
bioinformatician expert or the diagnostic molecular pathologist, but not the treating physician or the genetic
counselor; focus on making a genetic diagnosis at a single timepoint, rather than following the patient over time
during a lengthy diagnostic process, and are therefore unable to adequately support team-based, longitudinal
genomic diagnostic care. Addressing this pressing need, here we propose to develop a comprehensive software
system, Calypso, to address this pressing need. Calypso will support team-based diagnostics via intuitive and
visual iobio web tools tailored for each team member’s specialized contribution to diagnostic analysis; and
facilitate long-term genomic care by keeping patient genomic data up-to-date via a systematic variant re-
annotation infrastructure. We will put Calypso into the hands of the clinical teams in our undiagnosed disease
clinic and our neonatal intensive care unit, ideal testing grounds for evaluating our tool’s impact on long-term
genome diagnostic care in the context of team-based medicine. We will also centrally deploy and evaluate our
tool in NHGRI’s Undiagnosed Disease Network to help realize the collaborative diagnostic opportunities
presented by a large, clinically focused research consortium."

 Heart failure (HF) is a growing cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the best available treatments,
prognosis remains poor for many HF patients underscoring the unmet clinical need for new HF therapies.
This Outstanding Investigator Award application is inspired by the observation that exercise protects the
heart, promoting cardiomyocyte (CM) survival and proliferation while reducing fibrosis and inflammation. Yet
we understand little of the responsible mechanisms and whether they can be exploited therapeutically. Here,
I plan to leverage the longer-term support and scientific flexibility afforded by the NHLBI R35 Outstanding
Investigator Award to illuminate the cellular and molecular basis of the cardiac benefits of exercise and to
validate potential new therapeutic targets in preclinical models. We discovered that although exercise and
pathological stress both induce cardiac hypertrophy, the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced
hypertrophy are largely distinct and, rather than leading to adverse sequelae, paradoxically protect the heart
(Cell, 2010). We also found that exercise dramatically enhances endogenous cardiomyogenesis in the adult
mammalian heart (Nature Comm., 2018). In some cases, mimicking the changes seen in exercise not only
prevents but can reverse established HF (Science Transl. Med., 2019). Here we propose a broad program
to delineate the cellular and molecular effects of exercise, define the mechanistic pathways mediating
cardiomyogenesis and other benefits of exercise, and explore the translational potential of these pathways
in preclinical models. To describe the heart’s adaptive response to exercise in cardiomyocytes and non-
cardiomyocytes, a range of unbiased discovery tools will be employed including single nucleus RNA-
sequencing (snRNA-seq), bulk RNA-seq, and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq).
snRNA-seq will provide insight into cell lineage-specific changes in gene expression in response to exercise
over time, and this approach will be combined with lineage-specific gain- and loss-of-function models to help
define crosstalk between cell types. Several labeling tools will be used to facilitate identification of dividing
CMs in snRNA-seq studies to profile this dynamic process and test the hypotheses that specific
subpopulations of CMs and/or permissive environments are required for cardiomyogenesis. Statistically
robust candidates will be screened for protective and cardiomyogenic effects using relevant in vitro cell
culture and in vivo zebrafish models. The most promising will be studied in preclinical murine and porcine
models to uncover new biological pathways and develop new therapeutic approaches. The R35 mechanism
uniquely provides the flexibility and timeframe required to support the proposed unbiased discovery and
bioinformatic analyses and the generation of unique animal models. Successful completion of this program
will advance our understanding of cardiomyogenesis and the beneficial effects of exercise in the heart, while
delineating pathways with the potential to mitigate heart failure, thus meeting a pressing clinical need."
10767358,"Increasing numbers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are receiving post-
hospitalization care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Most will transition from the SNF to home. Although
there has been a great deal of attention paid to patients’ transition from the hospital to home, there has been
little research on transitions from the SNF to home. Experiencing multiple transitions from home to the hospital
to a SNF and back to home is difficult for patients with ADRD and their caregivers. After discharge from SNF to
home, patients may re-enter the cycle of transitions, suffering adverse outcomes such as hospital
readmissions, medication errors, functional decline, and loss of independence.
This project will identify factors associated with 30-day hospital readmission and other adverse outcomes for
patients with ADRD who transition from the SNF to home. We will use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
a large, national dataset that includes rich social and economic information that is pertinent to the risk of
adverse health outcomes. Our study takes advantage of the link between the HRS and Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services billing data, and especially the link to extensive data collected during SNF stay as part
of the Minimum Data Set and home health event data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set.
For Aim 1, we will describe the relationship of ADRD diagnosis or severity of cognitive impairment in the SNF
with hospital readmission for patients who transition from SNF to home. We hypothesize that individuals with
ADRD are at greater risk of hospital readmission when controlling for Andersen model factors. We also
propose that worse levels of cognitive impairment, as measured during a patient’s stay in the SNF, will be
associated with greater risk readmission risk. For Aim 2, we will identify the effect of early outpatient care,
either in clinic visit or via home health visit, on reducing readmissions. We hypothesize that early outpatient
care is protective against readmission. This represents a first step in identifying interventions to reduce
readmissions for people with ADRD who undergo this complex healthcare trajectory.
Dr. Carnahan’s career development plan will provide thorough training in research methods and health policy
related to transitions for older adults with ADRD. As an emerging aging researcher with expertise in the SNF to
home care transition, Dr. Carnahan will use the results of this study to design an intervention that improves the
health outcomes of cognitively impaired patients who experience this complex healthcare trajectory. Her long
term goal is to improve the quality of care and health outcomes for older adults with ADRD."
10779463,"Inputting and editing text on smartphones play an important role in people’s daily lives. Studies have
shown that they constitute 40% of one’s smartphone usage. For blind smartphone users, text input and text
editing tasks remain a challenge with studies showing that their typing speed is only 4-5 Words Per Minute
(WPM) on soft keyboards compared to 36 WPM of sighted users. While the use of voicing text input is
becoming prevalent among blind users, studies have shown that they spend 80% of their time on the average
editing spoken text, which is a slow, laborious process. This lack of efficient and convenient text input and
editing methods can make it difficult for blind users to use their smartphones proficiently and productively
for their everyday activities such as staying informed, connecting with friends and colleagues, shopping,
entertainment, travel, and for just about everything.
 This project will research and develop a new generation of intelligent text input and editing methods
that will substantially enhance the proficiency with which blind smartphone users can input and edit text.
To this end, the project has three overarching objectives: First, we will create a non-visual free-form gesture
input method that will enable blind users to enter a word or phrase with free-form touch gestures on the
default Qwerty soft keyboard on smartphones, rather than entering text one letter at a time, an arguably
slow process. It will bring the popular gesture typing method to blind users, and increase their text input
efficiency as it will eliminate the need to confirm each letter during text input. Second, we will create an
intelligent Braille soft keyboard that can automatically correct input errors and do auto-completion of
unseen letters, which until now has been unavailable for Braille. Auto-correction has been shown to reduce
the input errors by over 30% for typing on a Qwerty soft keyboard for sighted users, and introducing it to
Braille soft keyboards would result in an even greater error reduction as touch inputs of blind users are far
more error-prone. Third, we will leverage language models in combination with voicing and touch to
eliminate the tedious operations required by extant methods that rely exclusively on precise cursor
movements for editing erroneous text input, which can occur quite often with spoken text input. Based on
previous studies with sighted users that show a 30-40% gain in editing performance with this approach, we
expect even greater performance gains with blind users as cursor-based operations are far more challenging
for them. Successful accomplishments of these objectives will eliminate any barriers to productivity of
blind smartphone users and empower them to utilize the power and connectivity of these devices to fully
participate in this digitized economy as critical services are increasingly delivered via smartphone devices."

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, which accounts for large number of all
childhood cancer deaths. MB are very fast-growing tumors, which spreads to central nervous system (CNS)
through cerebrospinal fluid, which leads to leptomeningeal metastases that occurs up to 66% in brain cancer
patients. Despite the progress in treating MB, the 5-year survival rate for high-risk MB remains poor with high
recurrence. Moreover, the quality of life for those kids who do survive is substantially reduced due to the high
toxicity associated with the high radiation exposure and multiple drug chemotherapy they must endure at such
an early age. Therefore, it is critical to identify novel factors and understand previously undefined mechanisms
that drive MB growth and progression, so that safe and viable therapeutics can be developed for treating MB. In
this proposal, we provide compelling evidence that RNA demethylase ALKBH5 may play an important role in MB
growth and progression by supporting MB cancer (tumor initiating) stem cells (MB-CSC) and thus serve as a
novel therapeutic target. Our preliminary results revealed that MB cells are highly dependent on ALKBH5 for its
survival. Using multiple MB cell lines with or without ALKBH5 depletion, we discovered that depletion of ALKBH5
inhibited both short and long-term growth of MB cells. In addition, depletion of ALKBH5 inhibited the migration
of MB cells. Importantly, we show that ALKBH5 silencing suppressed the self-renewal/proliferation of MB stem
cell. Supporting that, ALKBH5-depletion led to significantly decreased levels of cancer stem cell markers. These
are significant findings as MB stem cells are considered to be the major source of MB initiation, maintenance,
relapse and render MB cells resistant to radiation. These observations led us to hypothesize that RNA
demethylase ALKBH5 supports MB growth and progression by promoting cancer stem cell self-renewal; and
those approaches aimed at targeting ALKBH5 level/activity will sensitize radiation response in MB patients. To
test these hypotheses, we propose following two Specific Aims: In aim#1, To establish the role of ALKBH5 as a
promoter of MB growth and progression. In aim#2, To determine the mechanism by which ALKBH5 regulates
MB stemness and growth by identifying and characterizing ALKBH5 target genes and their m6A status in MB
cells. Successful completion of this proposal will indicate RNA epigenetics as an important regulator of
medulloblastoma stem cell viability and self-renewal. Given that ALKBH5 knockout mice is reported to be viable
and our preliminary studies showing high dependency of MB cell survival on ALKBH5 suggest that ALKBH5 may
serve as a novel and safe therapeutic target for treating MB patients."

Clinically, atrophy of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature is poorly defined likely related to limited understanding
of fundamental biological processes underlying this complex, aberrant tissue phenotype. This lack of insight
underlies suboptimal therapeutic strategies for these challenging patients. In addition to fundamental
investigation regarding this phenotype, we hypothesize that initiation and maintenance of atrophy of the
intrinsic laryngeal musculature is related to signaling events in the mucosa. Specifically, our laboratory
elucidated the role of TGF-β signaling with an emphasis on therapeutic strategies targeting the SMAD family of
signaling proteins in the vocal fold lamina propria. SMADs, however, also mediate muscle atrophy in other
systems, specifically through regulation of atrogenes and myostatin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily. We
hypothesize that the inherent response to injury in the lamina propria elicits and/or enhances an atrophic in the
muscle. This concept is inherently innovative in that it refutes clinical dogma suggesting the vocal fold mucosa
and muscle of the vocal folds operate as wholly separate and distinct entities. In that regard, we propose to
interrogate fundamental and functional laryngeal muscle outcomes of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury-mediated
thyroarytenoid atrophy in the context of both acute and chronic mucosal injury. In addition, we seek to
interrogate key biochemical relationships and interactions between multiple cell types from the vocal folds to
provide foundational insight into processes underling atrophy. And finally, we seek to provide preliminary data
related to therapeutic strategies to prevent/treat laryngeal muscle atrophy targeting SMAD signaling.
Ultimately, these data represent substantive contributions to the literature and are foundational for the
development of novel treatment strategies for millions of patients with disability related to voice disorders and
laryngeal disease."

Flow cytometry is widely used in basic and translational research and in clinical diagnostic assays. Spectral flow
cytometry represents a revolutionary change in the approach to flow cytometry by using full spectral information
from each fluorophore—by collecting the emission over the full spectrum and using multiple excitation sources
for each fluorophore to obtain a spectral “signature” or “fingerprint”. The resulting spectral signature is used in
automated spectral unmixing that is simpler and more effective than current compensation methods. As a result,
even fluorophores with highly overlapping spectra can be used simultaneously, simplifying panel construction
and enlarging the maximum panel size; subtraction of cell autofluorescence is also improved. These factors
combine to allow greater resolution of cell subpopulations. In addition, hardware can be simplified since a
particular configuration of filter sets is not needed for a particular set of dyes. Spectral flow cytometry has
progressed to the mainstream, with several commercial spectral flow systems now available (Cytek Aurora, Sony
ID7000, BD Symphony A5 SE, Thermo Bigfoot).
However, the development of dyes has not kept pace with the development of spectral flow systems. For
example, Sony’s ID7000 system includes a 320 nm excitation source for which no dyes have been specifically
developed. We and others have developed a new family of ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles called Pdots,
which are semiconducting polymers collapsed into 5–30 nm (tunable size) nanoparticles. Pdots are bright and
photostable, and are unique in exhibiting a long, tunable Stokes shift, enabling the creation of a large color panel.
Here we propose to expand the multi-color panel of Pdots from 37 to 75 by adding 38 new colors,
including a new series of 18 Pdots excited at 320 nm (no previous Pdots have been excitable at 320 nm), as
well as 20 new Pdots excited at 355, 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm, filling gaps between the emission peaks of
existing Pdots with the same excitation while preserving a separation of at least 20 nm between emission peaks
with most emission peaks separated by 30 nm or larger. We will demonstrate the utility of these Pdots in spectral
flow cytometry by developing and validating a 75-parameter panel for deep immunophenotyping of major cell
subsets in human peripheral blood. The 75-color panel of Pdots will also be useful in high multiplex tissue
imaging (e.g., histopathology)."

 Approximately 90% of lung cancer results from smoking. Low Dose Computerized Tomography (LDCT) of
smokers can detect lung cancer earlier allowing more effective treatment. But determining which smokers should
get LDCT screening is controversial and potentially harmful. Recently, the U.S Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) updated their opinion on screening to recommend annual LDCT screening for current or recent
smokers between the ages of 50 and 80 who have smoked 20 pack years (PY) or more. In addition, they
specifically called for the development of biomarker-based methods to predict who will benefit from screening.
 Precision Epigenetics may answer this call. In 2012, we showed that DNA methylation at cg05575921, a
site in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene, predicts smoking status. Since then, over 100
studies have replicated those findings. In 2018, we developed Smoke Signature©, a precise, reference free
methylation sensitive digital PCR (MSdPCR) assay for this locus. In peer-reviewed publications, we have shown
that the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for this assay is 0.984 for daily
smokers, the amount of demethylation accurately predicts daily consumption and that the re-methylation
response to smoking cessation can be used to monitor success of cessation therapy.
 Intriguingly, in 2017, Bojesen and colleagues showed that cg05575921 methylation also predicts those
smokers likely to benefit from LDCT screening. Recently, we have now confirmed and extended these findings
using a subset of DNA specimens from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). In particular for those NLST
subjects who reported quitting smoking, our method significantly predicts lung cancer risk better than PY alone
in a racial and gender-free manner. However, our method is based only the data from 3200 NLST subjects, all
of whom smoked 30 PY or more.
 In this Phase II project, we propose to finish our assessments of the 4800 NLST subjects, all of whom have
> 30 PY of consumption and LDCT data, then use DNA from 4800 subjects in x-ray only arm of the NLST and
4800 subjects from the PLCO collection to extend the range of our test down to 20 PY of cigarette consumption.
We will then analyze the resulting data and develop a race and SES bias free Cox regression formula to predict
risk for those between the ages of 50-80 years and >20 PY of smoking. The resulting laboratory developed test
(LDT) will run on the 510K approved Bio-Rad QX-200 platform with reagents from companies that can comply
with FDA standards. When implemented, the test will decrease healthcare costs and morbidity and mortality
from unnecessary procedures. Eventually, we believe that this test will be essential for both prescreening
counselling and treatment monitoring of all smokers."
10907771,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Due to challenges with available technology in regions of the world where schistosomiasis is endemic, the
prevalence of schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SchPAH) is unknown. SchPAH is an
incurable and ultimately fatal disease for which early detection and treatment could extend the lives of those
afflicted. New approaches to diagnose SchPAH are needed, as the current diagnostic criteria require invasive
right heart catheterization leading to under and delayed diagnosis.
 An opportunity to develop noninvasive diagnostic risk scores for PAH is provided by the PVDomics dataset
and a collaboration to conduct these analyses at UCSF using the PVDomics data has been established. The
proposed studies will define diagnostic risk scores for PAH (i) using a broad range of clinical, echocardiographic
(echo), and biomarker predictors and (ii) using predictors easily measured in low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC). The risk scores would enable estimation of the probability of PAH in individuals, the PAH case-rate in
clinic samples, and PAH prevalence in communities at risk. Regardless of LMIC, the scores will rely only on
noninvasive predictors to support their repeated use in disease screening.
 After developing the risk score, its first application to will be to SchPAH disease, and will take place in the
longitudinal prospective cohorts we are enrolling at 3 clinical sites in Ethiopia and Zambia, targeting 40 enrollees
per site per year. We will estimate the case-rate of SchPAH by standard of care criteria and using the Aim-1
diagnostic risk score. Eligible patients will have a history of Schistosoma infection and be diagnosed with
schistosomiasis-associated hepatosplenic disease (SchHSD), placing them at relatively high risk for SchPAH.
At baseline and annual follow-up study visits each participant will undergo clinical and echocardiography
assessments, and providing blood samples for biomarker assessments to ensure that the predictors on which
the diagnostic score is based are on hand. Once it is defined, the risk score and probability of PAH will be
calculated on each participants’ data, both at past and future visits, and the distribution the quantities will be
summarized graphically. This study also will evaluate some biomarkers that reflect the pathobiology of SchPAH
and may be particularly suitable for identifying PAH disease during its preclinical and early clinical periods, which
could suggest a role as potential therapeutic targets.
 We believe these diagnostic tools will have enormous impact on all those worldwide who are at risk for
developing PAH or living with undiagnosed PAH."
10899589,"Background: While Black individuals make up 16% of the population in Miami, FL (an epicenter) they account for 29%
of new HIV diagnoses3 linked to structural racism, other isms, and their manifestations. Manifestations of structural
racism include healthcare desserts, barriers to access care (i.e., distance, transportation, finances), discrimination, and
medical mistrust that thwart HIV testing and prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake.47-49 Preliminary work. Our Five Point Initiative
(FPI) is a locally developed bundled implementation strategy (BIS) to expand the reach of evidence-based clinical
interventions (i.e., HIV testing, PrEP, condoms) to Black communities that harnesses partnerships with community HIV
experts, local businesses, and federally funded community health organizations, removes barriers to access by going to
communities, and enhances trust through racial/cultural competence and lived expertise.35-36 Successful 1-Year
Planning EHE Supplement (2019-2020). We built partnerships across 4 HIV high impact zip codes (13 businesses, 5
health partners, 10 events), piloted the approach (e.g., HIV testing was optional), and engaged residents (N=677).
Successful 2-Year EHE Implementation Supplement (2020-2022). We refined FPI BIS, reached 1,887 community
members who are not reached by standard public health approach (64% no knowledge of PrEP, only 4% prescribed
PrEP, 46% HIV test > 12 mons; 40% condomless sex past 3 mons), required HIV testing (90% [4% reactive]), provided
PrEP information (100%) and linkage (22%), and expanded the reach (13 high impact zip codes, 73 businesses, 54
events, and 8 health partners). Conceptual Model: This hybrid implementation trial type 2 proposal is guided by the
Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance framework (RE-AIM) to evaluate the FPI implementation
strategy. Research Plan: Via a cluster stepped wedged RCT we will randomly introduce 8 HIV high impact zip codes in
Miami, FL to the FPI intervention (2 outreach events per month over 21 months [42 total events per zip code]). We will:
(1) Assess whether the FPI intervention has a significant increase at the community level on (i) HIV testing (primary), (ii)
PrEP linkage/prescription (primary) and knowledge, and (iii) condom access/use. Outcomes i-iii will be assessed via
(a) pre-intervention surveys (n=225 residents per 8 zip codes: 1800 residents total) and post-intervention assessments
(n=225 residents per 8 zip code: 1800 residents total) (b) data from FPI intervention events, and (c) administrative data
from publicly funded health partners during non-intervention (pre- & post- FPI intervention) periods. (2) FPI and health
partner administrative data will be used to assess (2a) how effective FPI BIS is at engaging Black residents in HIV testing
and PrEP linkage (reach), (2b) describe among whom (adoption) and how (fidelity, adaptations, costs) the FPI
intervention was implemented, and (2c) assess sustainability via survey and periodic reflections with implementation
partners (maintenance). (3) Conduct spatial analysis to examine if the FPI intervention in zip codes randomized to the
intervention explains variations in the outcomes (Aim 1 i– iii; Aim 2a) and HIV base rates for neighboring zip codes who
did not receive the intervention. Implications: Assessing effectiveness and implementation outcomes of FPI may equip
us with a bundled strategy to increase HIV testing and PrEP uptake among Black and other minoritized communities."
10744210,"The ultimate success of immunotherapy for brain malignancies, such as malignant glioma, will require integration of in-depth understanding of immunology with solutions for the following long-standing challenges: 1) paucity and heterogeneous expression of glioma-specific antigens; 2) poor homing and persistence of effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs); and 3) glioma-induced immunosuppression. My laboratory has been contributing to critical discoveries in each of these areas, and integrated our findings into novel immunotherapy clinical trials for glioma patients. In the current proposal, we will leverage our current research directions by combining our expertise on glioma antigens and cutting-edge cell-engineering technologies in preclinical studies. We hypothesize that integration of novel cell-engineering and antigen-targeting approaches will allow us to develop safer and more effective immunotherapy strategies by overcoming heterogeneous expression of antigens and unique challenges in brain immunology. We will evaluate the following strategies: 1. Novel glioma neoantigens for safe and effective immunotherapy. We will leverage our current NINDS awards (R01NS096954 and R21NS093654) and characterize T-cell receptors (TCRs) specific to neoantigens derived from both pediatric and adult gliomas. 2. Sequential chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)/TCR system for targeting multiple antigens. As a way to safely target glioma-associated antigens (GAAs) in the tumor microenvironment without damaging normal cells outside of the brain, we will evaluate the novel sequential Synthetic Notch (synNotch) CAR/TCR system, in which antigen signaling through the first CAR or TCR against a tumor-specific antigen induces the second, anti-GAA CAR/TCR to trigger the CTL activity at the tumor site. 3. Targeting the glioma immune environment by creating tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). The absence of lymphatic organs and professional antigen presenting cells are thought to be major reasons for insufficient immune responses in the brain. We will evaluate whether induction of TLOs in the brain tumor site will facilitate efficient and long-lasting glioma antigen-specific immune responses in the brain tumor site. These 3 strategies will be logically integrated into combination approaches. Novel antigens and TCRs will be adopted into the synNotch CAR/TCR system, and the TLO approach would also be most beneficial when combined with the synNotch CAR/TCR system. As expected per the purpose of the NINDS R35 mechanism, these strategies may involve high risks. However, based on our proof-of-principle preliminary data, we will persistently pursue our goals with the long-term support by the R35 mechanism, and flexibly and swiftly adopt new technologies. These studies will also integrate with other areas of ongoing studies in our lab. For example, oncolytic virus-mediated expression of target antigen and CTL-attracting chemokine (“payload” approaches) would help us to overcome the paucity and heterogeneous expression of antigens as well as tumor homing of CTLs to the glioma tissue. The R35 would allow these integrations."
10900626,"Abstract. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that uses low-levels of
light (650-900 nm) to noninvasively measure changes in cerebral blood volume and oxygenation. Meanwhile,
electroencephalography (EEG) measures the neural oscillatory activity which can be divided into various
rhythms frequency bands. We propose a paradigm shifting analysis approach where instead of using EEG or
fNIRS to estimate and test the de novo brain activation pattern for a specific task, we utilize our existing
knowledge of common patterns of brain activity from similar tasks done in fMRI to create a set of testable [null]
hypotheses; namely, “is the pattern of fNIRS/EEG measured [not] consistent with what is expected from (e.g.)
the general category of working memory tasks?”
 Our innovative proposal is to map brain signals onto the “cognitive domains” underlying complex brain
functions rather than task themselves. Specifically, we purpose to use a projection (reparameterization) of
brain signals using spatial maps defined by the six key cognitive domains defined by the DSM-V; language,
perceptual-motor, executive function, complex attention, social cognition, and learning and memory. These
maps are generated from meta-analysis of hundreds of existing fMRI studies pooled across all tasks related to
the cognitive domain as a keyword allowing us to develop model training from a large repository of varied
tasks. This reparameterization and compression of the brain signals into this low dimensional space provides a
task-agnostic, statistically testable, and interpretable signal, which can be examined in real-time. The main
aims of this study are:
 · Aim 1. Develop and validate fNIRS-EEG features in cognitive domains.
 · Aim 2. Test-retest reliability of fNIRS-EEG features.
 · Aim 3. Quantitative sensitivity-specificity report of the prediction model.
 · Aim 4. Implementation real-time fNIRS-EEG for cognitive domain classification."
10874679,"During the late phase of HIV-1 infection cycle, the virally encoded Gag polyproteins are targeted to the plasma
membrane (PM) for assembly, formation of immature particles, and virus release. Gag–PM binding is mediated
by interactions of the N-terminally myristoylated matrix (MA) domain with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PI(4,5)P2). Concurrent to Gag assembly, the envelope (Env) protein is recruited to the PM for incorporation into
virus particles. Env recruitment, and hence gp41, to a nascent virion is essential for downstream infectivity.
Without gp41, there is no fusion and no infectivity. Several lines of evidence suggest that Env incorporation is
mediated by interactions between the cytoplasmic tail of gp41 (gp41CT) and the MA domain of Gag. It has been
long recognized that only a few (< 10) gp41 molecules are embedded in the MA layer. Both gp41CT and a well-
formed MA lattice are essential for incorporation and infectivity. It appears that it is not sufficient to only embed
gp41CT in the MA layer, but it is necessary for the MA layer to undergo a cleavage induced maturation step for
gp41 to become fully active. The incorporation and activation of gp41 has been a long-standing problem whose
solution requires a structural approach. Recent low-resolution cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies
proposed a model in which the MA domain undergoes a structural transformation to form distinct MA lattices
during assembly and upon maturation. During the current funding period, our lab has shown that MA forms a
hexamer of trimers lattice with a central hole, thought to accommodate gp41CT to promote incorporation into
virions. We have also shown that PI(4,5)P2 is capable of binding to alternate sites on MA, consistent with a novel
and perhaps distinct MA–membrane binding mechanisms during assembly of the immature particle and upon
maturation. However, the structural details of the MA lattice (immature and mature) bound to membrane, factors
that govern the MA conformational switch, factors that (de)stabilize the MA lattice, and the structural basis for
MA–gp41CT interaction during assembly and upon maturation, are still lacking. The aims of this proposal are
designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that render HIV infectious by studying how gp41CT is
embedded in the MA layer. We devised innovative “controlled assembly” approaches which will enable us to
generate biologically authentic substructures of the immature and mature gp41CT–MA complex. To study these
substructures, we have developed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) approaches which will allow us to use
single particle rather than cryo-ET techniques to enable near atomic structural determination. Our aims are to
(1) determine the structural basis for MA lattice formation during assembly of the immature particle and upon
maturation, (2) determine factors critical for MA lattice formation and Env incorporation, and to (3) determine the
structure of the MA–gp41CT–membrane complex by single-particle cryo-EM. The proposed studies will fill a
major gap in HIV replication and infectivity, which may help in the development of new antiviral therapeutic
agents that inhibit assembly, Env incorporation, and ultimately virus production."
10892262,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescents and young adults (AHIV) ages 12-30 years have disproportionately poorer outcomes across the
HIV care continuum, including lower rates of adherence to oral ART (oART) and viral suppression (VS) than
older adults, correlating with individual risk of poor health and disease progression and public health risk of
secondary transmission. AHIV are a priority population in the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States
Initiative (EHE). Unique multi-layered factors (e.g., cognitive development, psychosocial determinants, system
barriers) underlie AHIV's nonadherence and VS; therefore, AHIV-specific interventions are needed to address
those factors and ultimately improve VS. Toward this aim, our group has shown that AHIV are more likely to be
retained in care and achieve and maintain VS if cared for at clinics with youth-friendly structures and services,
more likely to achieve VS with single tablet regimens (STR) vs. multi-tablet oral ART (oART) regimens, and have
high interest in ART strategies not taken orally, specifically long-acting injectable ART (LAI-ART). These findings
underscore the importance of engaging AHIV in decision-making and providing access to alternative biomedical
strategies that obviate daily adherence, like LAI-ART, should they choose. Though uptake and rollout has been
slow, LAI-ART (cabotegravir/rilpivirine) administered q4-8 weeks has been approved for HIV treatment in those
>12 years-old who have achieved VS—excluding up to 50% of all AHIV due to their decreased likelihood of VS.
We have reported provider biases and disparities in ART initiation by patient age and have concern that AHIV
may have decreased access to LAI-ART, resulting in a tiered system that precludes LAI-ART access from those
who may want and benefit from it most. AHIV need biomedical and care delivery innovations to address their
challenges meeting EHE goals by optimizing feasibility of delivering novel biomedical tools for AHIV through
minimizing medication and healthcare system barriers. The central hypothesis of the Strategies to AchieVe
Viral Suppression for Youth with HIV (SAVVY) Study is that informed choice, counseling on ART options,
and facilitating access, will increase rates of achieving and sustaining VS among AHIV. The study
proposes to present and solicit informed choice of ART among both AHIV with and without VS, including
facilitating LAI-ART (if VS can be achieved). For AHIV who prefer LAI-ART, the SAVVY intervention will support
AHIV in successfully meeting or maintaining criteria (VL<50 copies/mL) for LAI-ART consideration, and deploy
a focused team that facilitates access to LAI-ART. Study outcomes include VS and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) for AHIV undergoing the SAVVY intervention, identification of implementation barriers utilizing an
established implementation science framework, and assessment of the cost-effectiveness of SAVVY using an
economic-epidemiologic model. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise to implement the SAVVY study and we
anticipate that the results of The SAVVY study will inform the real-world implementation and optimization of LAI-
ART AHIV toward reducing disparities in outcomes and ending the epidemic for the key population of AHIV."

The overarching goal of this project is to create software that improves the use of intracranial
EEG to qualify patients with medication-resistant epilepsy for neurosurgery. One million people
in the US suffer from continual seizures that are not controlled by medication. The current
estimate is that half of these could be treated effectively by surgical resection of the epileptic
cortical tissue, and yet the majority of them will not receive the surgery (Engel & Wiebe, 2012).
There are 200 Comprehensive Epilepsy Centers in the US that are certified to provide both the
epilepsy resection and the multimodal presurgical evaluation (clinical semiology,
neuropsychological assessment, EEG, MRI, PET, and intracranial or icEEG). A problem for this
evaluation is the software for integrating the multiple imaging and assessment modalities in the
presurgical workup to allow confidence in the neurosurgical plan. The localization of the icEEG
electrodes is often problematic because of brain shift (movement and deformation of the brain
from the preoperative imaging to the postoperative CT used for electrode position imaging).
With recent advances in dense array EEG (dEEG) with individual head conductivity models,
electrical source imaging can provide noninvasive estimates of the seizure onset zone, which
could then guide more focused and effective icEEG probes, and potentially more confident and
limited neurosurgical resections. The present SBIR research builds on our extensive experience
with icEEG electrode localization, multimodal neuroimage registration, dEEG source imaging,
and user interface design to create Sourcerer IC, a software platform optimized for bringing
multiple forms of evidence to interpret icEEG measures and improve the localization of the
seizure onset zone. The key innovations of this project are: the integration of multimodal
neuroimaging data (MRI, dwMRI, fMRI, PET) registered precisely with structural MRI in a
DICOM format for export to the neurosurgeon’s neuronavigator software; the capacity for
noninvasive dEEG source localization of spikes and seizure onset with individual head
conductivity models in preparation for icEEG electrode placement (as validation rather than
exploration); the correction of brain shift due to surgical implanting of icEEG electrodes by
registering the postoperative CT to the preoperative MRI; and perhaps most importantly, the
integration of all components of the presurgical workup within an intuitive and usable software
workflow with full quality system regulation and validation following FDA guidelines. Sourcerer
IC will build on the many years of experience with Yale’s BioImage Suite, such that physicians
and technicians access their components of the workflow through secure web interfaces, and
the networked database maintains and integrates all transactions to coordinate computational
as well as data resources for efficient completion, review, and implementation of an optimized
neurosurgical plan."

The CDC categorize carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP)
as “urgent threats” because few antibiotics are available to combat these multidrug-resistant ‘superbugs’.
Current efforts to improve outcomes are to develop new drugs active against these microbes and to
pharmacodynamically (PD) optimize the efficacies of monotherapies to maximize bacterial killing. To date,
monotherapies have produced suboptimal clinical cures due to resistance emergence. Our overarching
hypothesis is that highly effective therapy for CRAB and CRKP infections requires combination regimens that
maximize bacterial killing and suppress resistance emergence. We further hypothesize that understanding the
target receptor binding in intact bacteria, as well as the transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic resistance
responses of CRAB and CRKP to suboptimal and therapeutic drug exposures will allow us to design and validate
dosage regimens that can successfully combat CRAB and CRKP. The mechanistic insights from Project #1 and
the Mechanistic Assay Core #2 will provide an innovative, rational path for building highly effective combination
dosage regimens that extensively inactivate the optimal sets of penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). These regimens
will be further enhanced by non-PBP-binding partner antibiotics, where the PBP-binders and the non-PBP-
binding antibiotics each counter-select the resistance mechanisms amplified by the partner drug(s). Insights on
synergistic PBP occupancy patterns and optimal target site penetration of PBP-binders will be provided by
Project #1. In SA#1, we will study the newer antimicrobials for which there is no PD information (dose
range/fractionation or resistance suppression targets) in the Hollow Fiber Infection Model (HFIM). In SA#2,
promising 2- and 3-drug combinations will be studied as identified by Project #1. In each SA we will use multiple
omics approaches to characterize synergistic killing and resistance suppression using samples from the HFIM.
This will allow creation of optimal mono-and combination therapy regimens. A virtually unexplored area is the
effect of time (4th dimension) on the expression of PBPs as well as on the associated resistance mechanisms
(e.g. β-lactamases, efflux and porins), and on non-replicative persisters (NRPs; i.e. a very hard to kill population).
In SA#3, we will study these issues by using the HFIM by altering intervention time and by leveraging mechanistic
insights on target site penetration, intact-cell receptor binding and the expression of resistance mechanisms. We
will assess NRPs, surviving bacteria with morphological changes, and other populations via flow cytometry of
fluorescently labelled strains with sorting. The Mathematical Modeling Core #3 will characterize these synergistic
antibiotic interactions to optimize the metrics of rapid/extensive killing and resistance suppression. This will serve
as a first level prospective validation of the mechanistic insights from Project #1 and will allow for an in vivo
prospective validation in Project #3. Information will flow back between all 3 Projects to refinement all models."

Women living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face a disproportionate burden of incidence and
mortality from cervical cancer, accounting for 85% of incident cases and 90% of mortality globally. Women living
with HIV (WLWH), the majority of whom live in LMICs, bear the greatest burden with up to 6 times increased risk
of cervical cancer due to higher incidence and persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The World
Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of ablation or excisional treatment for suspected or confirmed
cervical precancer in LMICs, in a 'screen & treat' strategy to limit loss to follow-up. However, among WLWH,
both treatment methods experience high failure rates, with a 30% recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN2/3) at two years following thermal ablation. Treatment failure rates are driven partly by high rates of
persistent HPV infection following both ablation and excisional treatment in WLWH. High treatment failures are
a significant limitation of the current cervical cancer secondary prevention strategy among WLWH and call for
studies on feasible, innovative, yet accessible therapies to improve HPV clearance and reduce precancer
treatment failure in WLWH. I will build on ongoing U.S-based trials that demonstrate safety and possible efficacy
of artesunate, a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin for treatment of HPV-associated anogenital lesions. My
proposed study will generate preliminary data on the feasibility of using self-administered artesunate vaginal
inserts as adjuvant therapy following thermal ablation to improve treatment outcomes among HPV+ WLWH in
LMICs. I will leverage my decade-plus collaboration with Ministry of Health-supported HIV clinics in Western
Kenya, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and new and established collaborators to conduct this
study successfully. In this planning grant, I propose a pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate
the following specific aims: 1) evaluate uptake and acceptability of self-administered artesunate vaginal inserts
as adjuvant treatment following thermal ablation in HPV+ WLWH in an LMIC, 2) test and evaluate three methods
of assessing adherence to self-administered artesunate to inform a future study protocol, and 3) perform a
preliminary comparison of type-specific hrHPV clearance at six months following randomization in the artesunate
and matched placebo arms as a statistical planning aim to obtain effect sizes to power a future trial. This study
will be the first to evaluate the feasibility of artesunate vaginal inserts for improving the current ‘screen & treat’
cervical cancer prevention strategy among WLWH in LMICs. If found to be feasible and effective, artesunate,
which is included in the WHO’s Essential Medications List, could be repurposed in this highly scalable approach
to impact a significant global public health problem."

Cell type-specific transcriptional programming enables a single fertilized egg to make the remarkable
transition to become a multicellular organism. The requisite sequence of gene expression transitions is
the result of a collaboration between cell type-specific transcription factors and broadly expressed
chromatin regulators. Historically, my group has made significant contributions to understanding the
targeting and spreading of chromatin domains, and currently we are probing the ability of modular
chromatin factors to respond to local concentrations of transcription factors and their co-activators to
specify cell type. Our studies focus on the dynamic competition between Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax
group (TrxG) proteins, and due to the high conservation of these key regulatory factors we move
between fly embryos and mammalian cells with ease. We have recently contributed to the recognition
of the ancient conservation of alternative forms of PcG complexes, and over the next funding period
we will investigate the distinct molecular roles that must underly this remarkable conservation. To
understand when, where, and how variant Polycomb complexes function, the Drosophila melanogaster
embryonic and germline systems harbor special promise for key aspects of this work. In particular,
emerging approaches in the germline will allow us to dissect the earliest events in the establishment of
PcG/TrxG regulation. A key challenge will be to adapt current methods to integrate alternative
configurations of protein complexes with their local binding patterns and genetic knockdown
phenotypes. For example, we have discovered that a Pho/Sfmbt protein module can interact with co-
activators as well as variant PRC1.6 complexes in Drosophila embryos, and we will test whether these
are modular interactions that vary on a gene-by-gene basis during normal development. We will also
analyze aberrant epigenetic programs in mammalian cells, in light of the important role that a dynamic
PcG/TrxG competition plays in human malignancies. Focusing on chromatin-driven cancers caused by
aberrant TrxG fusion oncoproteins such as MOZ-TIF2 will complement our analyses of normal cell type
transitions. This topic is of key biomedical significance, as plasticity of transcriptional programming is
thought to underlie the devastating facility of cancer sub-populations to acquire drug resistance and to
metastasize. Important benchmarks for our work will be i) identifying the initial steps that poise
developmental genes for activation or repression, ii) providing a mechanistic understanding for how
resolution occurs, and iii) contributing to an understanding of cell state switching in response to cancer
drivers. More broadly, our work will highlight regulation at the level of dynamic protein interactions,
which is likely universal to all biological systems."

Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the US. Birth defects also have
enormous associated emotional and economic costs. The California Center's research efforts,
both independently and in collaboration with other Centers for Birth Defects Research and
Prevention contributing to the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) and the Birth
Defects Study to Evaluate Pregnancy Exposures (BD-STEPS), have been at the forefront of
public health birth defects research. With this new funding opportunity, referred to here as “BD-
STEPS III” to distinguish from earlier BD-STEPS programs initiated in 2013 (BD-STEPS I) and
2018 (BD-STEPS II), our Center will further enhance scientific understanding of the potential
causes of specific birth defects, which will undoubtedly have important implications for risk
assessment and prevention of common, costly, and deadly birth defects. In this application we
propose the following aims:
Aim 1: Enhance the epidemiologic public health research capacity of the Centers for Birth
Defects and Research and Prevention by actively participating in BD-STEPS III in a region of
the US that is highly diverse in its race/ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, and
environmental exposures.
Aim 2: Utilize data from BD-STEPS I-III, as well as the earlier NBDPS (and likely other data
sources unique to California), to conduct rigorous collaborative and local studies that will identify
potential modifiable risk factors for selected birth defects (and where appropriate, in combination
with genetic susceptibility) to reduce the public health burden of birth defects in the US.
The California Center is well-equipped to contribute to BD-STEPS III – it is a world leader in
birth defects epidemiology and highly experienced in the development, data collection and
dissemination of information from population-based studies of birth defects, exemplified by its
outstanding performance within the CDC Centers for Birth Defects Research and its highly
innovative research portfolio. The application describes how the California Center will
accomplish Aims 1 and 2 and will thereby further the knowledge base about causes and
prevention for human birth defects. The California Center has extensive experience conducting
research related to the BD-STEPS III areas of focus, which include maternal chronic diseases
and their treatment, infectious disease in pregnancy, and medications. We have proposed
several analytic inquiries, complemented by the use of additional innovative datasets and
analytic approaches, which will enable us to collaboratively continue elucidating the contribution
of these and other modifiable risk factors to birth defects."

While there are now successful treatment regimens and prevention strategies for people living with HIV/AIDS,
the HIV pandemic remains a public health crisis in the United States and worldwide, with nearly 40,000 new
infections each year in the US alone. To prevent the spread of HIV in vulnerable populations, the US Preventive
Services Task Force has recommended HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for all adults and adolescents at
risk of HIV acquisition. Although current antiretroviral drug regimens are potent and well-tolerated, enabling the
life-long suppression of HIV-1 infection and the prevention of HIV-1 infection in individuals at high risk,
compliance rates are low. Long-acting antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have the potential to improve drug adherence,
reduce viral transmission, prevent new infections, and limit the emergence of viral drug resistance and systemic
toxicities. However, the key challenge for using long-acting ARVs is to extend the dosing interval to reduce the
pressure on the healthcare facilities, which are set up for every six-month clinic visits. This challenge likely
reduces compliance, particularly in the PrEP setting. Poor compliance has been shown to increase infection
rates and the possibility of developing drug resistance. Exavir Therapeutics, Inc has created an “ultra” long-
acting ARV by developing an ultra-long-acting, nanoformulated injectable prodrug to overcome this challenge.
Building upon our Phase I equivalent data, we proposed in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project to further develop
our drug by 1) completing the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls development of the drug substance and
drug product, 2) completing IND-enabling studies, and 3) obtaining FDA IND approval. Upon completion, this
Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project will enable the submission of an IND to the FDA for approval and preparation of
our Phase I first-in-human clinical trial. If successful, the impact of our novel “ultra” long-acting ARV on HIV-1
prevention and quality of life for individuals already infected with HIV-1 will be far-reaching in real-world settings."

A critical process for early development of the vertebrate embryo is induction of the three primary germ layers.
Knowledge of the molecules that are produced in each embryonic cell is essential to understanding their
function to pattern the embryonic body. Decades of innovative cell biological and embryological studies,
assessment of function one gene at a time, and recently deep transcriptomics profiling via next-generation
sequencing have exposed the developmental roles of important genes, transcripts, and some proteins. As a
result, scientists have defined the spatial and temporal changes of mRNAs and abundant proteins, and some
serendipitously identified metabolites of importance, such as folate assisting in closure of the neural tube.
However, it has been technologically impossible to utilize high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), the gold
standard technology for proteomics and metabolomics (`omics), to study hundreds of metabolites and
thousands proteins in single embryonic cells in the vertebrate embryo. Further, in developing systems, a
complex correlation between gene transcription and translation as well as posttranslational modifications
complicate the use of mRNA information to approximate protein and metabolite levels. Without the availability
of single-cell HRMS as a routine laboratory tool or other technologies capable of deep metabolomics and
proteomics, scientists at present lack insights into metabolic processes that contribute to early embryonic
patterning. The research program proposed here fills this enormous knowledge and technological gap by
utilizing ultrahigh-sensitivity HRMS platforms that were custom-designed, custom-built, and validated in the
vertebrate frog (Xenopus laevis) embryo, a popular model in cell/developmental biology, to understand
noncanonical metabolomic processes that control formation of the germ layers. Most recently, single-cell
HRMS in X. laevis has discovered metabolites that are capable of (i) altering the normal cell fates of embryonic
cells, (ii) communicating between blastomeres, and (iii) affecting the whole-organismal performance of the
resulting tadpole. These findings have shed light on a gap in our basic knowledge of molecules participating in
the successful induction of the germ layers. This research program will determine roles that metabolites play in
patterning the embryonic body plan. This work will integrate classical embryological manipulations, cell-fate

collected from Xenopus are likely to have high relevance to human development. This interdisciplinary
research program will help discover metabolic mechanisms governing cell differentiation and embryogenesis."

Childhood obesity is a serious and costly health problem in the United States that disproportionately affects
economically disadvantaged children living in rural, low-income areas. Despite this, virtually no effective
preventive strategies target the childcare setting, where many children eat 75% of their meals. Responsive
feeding (RF) practices, which provide structure and limits while allowing the child to exercise some autonomy,
foster the development of self-regulation of food intake. RF has been shown to be a promising target of
interventions, but these trials have focused primarily on the home environment. Strategies to improve the food
environment and promote RF and child appetite regulation in multiple settings are needed.
The ONE PATH study will rigorously test the effect of adding RF and appetite regulation components to an
existing, evidence-based program that intervenes on the childcare setting environment. An innovative
methodological framework, Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), will be used to identify which
intervention components improve RF and children’s appetite regulation among rural, low-income children
enrolled in Head Start. Using a factorial design, Head Start classrooms (n=48) will be randomized to receive or
not receive three components: a) RF training for early childhood education (ECE) providers, delivered via
online module; b) RF training for parents, delivered at home by Extension educators; and c) child self-
regulation curriculum, delivered in Head Start classrooms. The interventions will take place over the course of
one school year (~9 months), spanning three cohorts. Intervention component efficacy will be determined by
evaluating caregiver feeding practices and child appetite regulation (primary outcomes) and changes in
childcare and home environments, and child BMI z-score (secondary outcomes). This study will yield an
optimized intervention comprised of effective and efficient components that will be “packaged” and tested in a
future RCT. The proposed research will improve the evidence base needed to translate lessons learned in the
laboratory to community settings where children eat, optimizing the care of preschool-aged children.
To successfully complete this study, we have assembled a transdisciplinary team, including researchers,
educators, and Extension professionals. Advisory board members will represent the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP), Penn State Cooperative Extension - Better Kid Care, and Pennsylvania Head Start. Our
multi-disciplinary team has a history of working together and are well suited to design and test this multi-site,
multi-component intervention. We have experiences implementing interventions in the home and classroom
settings, with access to Head Start children in 7 rural counties in Pennsylvania. This application has several
unique features/strengths including: public health/clinical significance, targeting RF of ECE providers, engaging
parents in ECE care, and using innovative methods to optimize our intervention. This research compliments
the over-reaching goal of NIH to improve maternal/child health and it is consistent with the NIDDK mission."

In the event of a large scale radiologic or nuclear event, the immediate needs are to discriminate exposed
individuals from the worried well and identify individuals at risk for radiation-induced tissue damage. Humans
vary in their sensitivity to radiation-induced tissue injury, the factors that control radiation sensitivity are not fully
understood, and there are no biomarkers to identify individuals at risk for radiation-induced tissue damage. The
skin is an immunologically active barrier tissue that will be impacted by all types of external radiation events.
Skin is visually observable, accessible to non-invasive testing and easily sampled, making it amenable to a
variety of testing modalities. We propose to irradiate and study living, immunologically intact human skin grafts
on immunodeficient NSG mice to identify biomarkers that detect exposure to radiation and predict radiation
induced tissue damage. In Aim 1, we will study the effects of irradiation on adult human skin grafts carried by
NSG mice. We will study DNA damage repair proteins, reactive oxygen species, epithelial barrier function and
gene expression changes in adult human skin grafts exposed to 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 5.0 Gy irradiation. We will
identify biomarkers that detect radiation exposure within 24 hours of exposure (Phase I), remain detectable
longer term and/or correlate with later tissue injury (Phase II) and we will validate these biomarkers in a
separate validation cohort of 30 human skin donors (Phase III). In Aim 2, we will study the effects of irradiation
on human neonatal foreskin grafts, a tissue that contains antigen presenting cells but lacks T cells, as a model
for both pediatric and immunocompromised populations. We will test biomarkers identified in Aim 1 for their
ability to detect radiation exposure within 24 hours and to predict tissue injury in neonatal foreskin. If
necessary, we will identify new biomarkers for use in pediatric and immunocompromised populations. In Aim 3,
we will develop rapid point-of-care tests to detect the biomarkers we identify in Aims 1 and 2. The skin is an
accessible tissue that can be studied as a proxy to predict the risk of radiation-induced injury at other tissue
sites. By studying immunologically intact skin from a diverse population of human donors, we will identify
biomarkers that are useful in i) humans, ii) a diverse, outbred population with differing sensitivities to radiation,
and iii) pediatric and immunocompromised populations. Identification of biomarkers that predict subsequent
tissue damage in skin will identify radiation sensitive individuals. Our point-of-care tests have the potential to
rapidly screen potentially exposed populations and identify individuals who are at risk for tissue damage and
will require further medical attention."

inflame the dental pulp, creating extreme pain. Extirpating the inflamed pulp (and potentially replacing it with inert
materials) ameliorates the pain, but the procedure leaves a devitalized tooth. An alternative is possible in juvenile
patients, called over-instrumentation (OI). During OI, the pulpal chamber is exposed to the peripheral circulation
post-pulpectomy. As long as the apical papilla is intact, some tissue regeneration takes place in the pulpal canal
subsequently — although the disorganized tissue does not mimic native soft tissue. In adults in particular, OI
results in non-functional pulpal ossification. Another concern in endodontic procedures is occurrence/recurrence
of colonization by oral bacteria. Such infections may prolong and exacerbate pulpal inflammation. A material-
based formulation is proposed that can (a) promote vascularized soft-tissue regeneration in the pulp, while (b)
resisting bacterial infection. Our strategy rests on self-assembling peptide hydrogels — a class of supramolecular
materials that can be injected in vivo while keeping their gel-like properties. The materials consist of canonical
amino acids and are biocompatible. Such materials need to provide both mechanical support and biological cues
for tissue ingrowth. Somewhat counter-intuitively, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel, without added growth
factors or exogenous cells, demonstrated formation of vascularized soft-tissue in a canine pulpectomy model in
28 days. In a separate study, a different cationic amphiphilic hydrogel belonging to the same platform, showed
efficacy in inhibiting bacterial growth via membrane permeabilization. In this proposal, a combinatorial treatment
modality will be tested for its effectiveness in achieving the dual goals described above. A mechanistic puzzle
that these projects would help solve is the lineage/source of infiltrating cells and evolution of the cellular milieu
in the pulpal canal after pulpectomy and implantation of soft biomimetic hydrogels. Characterization of the long-
term maturation of the vascularized soft tissue promoted by such hydrogels is another target. The multi-
disciplinary project proposed in this Bioengineering Research Grant application would bring together a chemist
and bioengineer (PI V.A.K., an early-stage investigator), a specialist in oral bacterial colonies (co-I C.C.), and an
endodontist (co-I E.S.), to solve an enduring challenge: regenerating biomimetic vascularized soft tissue post-
pulpectomy. In vitro mechanistic analyses, in vivo characterization of infiltrating cells, and histologic/radiographic
identification of long-term evolution of the pulpal soft tissue and the pulp-dentin complex would build on published
studies and extensive preliminary data. Even if the proposed experiments are only partially successful, we would
learn about tissue-material interaction in the context of dental pulp. Success of the aims would produce
compelling data for a cell-free, growth-factor-free, off-the-shelf material formulation ideal for application in
endodontic settings and improve clinical outcomes in millions of patients needing pulpectomy."

The interpretation of thousands to millions of variants identified in whole exome and genome sequencing
(WES/WGS), respectively, is a challenging task and requires variant frequency together with phenotype
information that are not available in most public databases. The development of tools that enable data sharing
of genomic data together with phenotypic features is essential for rare disease gene discovery. In 2013 we
created GeneMatcher (10,574 users in 93 countries, cited in >380 publications), the first and most used web-
based tool to connect individuals (researchers, clinicians, patients, etc) around the globe with interest in the
same genes, variants or phenotypes. In 2019, we developed VariantMatcher (625 users in 43 countries, 428
queried variants, 61 matched variants), to share variant-level and phenotypic data from WES/WGS. To enable
variant prioritization for investigators around the world, we developed PhenoDB (> 143 unique downloads of
source code, 1,828 users from 65 countries). This freely available, web-based tool allows users naïve to
bioinformatics to store, share, analyze and interpret patient phenotypes and sequence variants from WES/WGS.
Users currently store in one instance of PhenoDB extensive phenotypic data (described with 3,646 terms
mapped to HPO) from 37,712 individuals in 9,711 families with an average of 6.8 features/affected individual,
describing > 2,282 diseases. Annotated WES/WGS variants are available for 7,724 individuals from 4,446
families. PhenoDB facilitates data sharing and analysis access world-wide. As of 1 December 2020, 6,151
sequenced individuals in PhenoDB were consented and submitted for phenotypic and genotypic matching
through VariantMatcher. However, the ongoing development of new sequencing methods, analysis pipelines
and data sharing platforms requires development of novel functions in our highly utilized resources and
integration with other newly created platforms to ensure that thousands of investigators can perform state of the
art analysis of genomic and phenotypic data to better interpret candidate variants. There is a critical need to
maintain and improve tools that allow genomic and phenotypic data integration and sharing. To fill this need, we
will leverage input from users of PhenoDB, GeneMatcher and VariantMatcher, collaborations with creators of
tools and platforms with complementary functions, and our evolving expertise in sequencing analysis and gene
discovery to improve our community resources. To this end, we will:
1. Implement new functions in GeneMatcher, VariantMatcher and PhenoDB to enable additional types of
queries, variant filtering and prioritization pipelines.
2. Connect GeneMatcher and VariantMatcher with other, community-wide data sharing tools and
integrate PhenoDB with other workflow platforms.
3. Expand our PhenoDB Genomic Education program."

Sound localization is a fundamental auditory ability that is facilitated by differences in the sound reaching each
ear. Localization is important for safety and for auditory awareness in natural 3D environments. Binaural
hearing also supports spatial release from masking, where detection and recognition are improved by spatially
separating the primary source – the target – and interfering sources – the masker. Spatial release from
masking is critical for speech recognition in noisy backgrounds, especially when the background contains
competing speech. What we do not understand yet is the relationship between these two phenomena of
binaural hearing – localization and spatial release from masking. The studies in this project ask whether sound
localization and spatial release from masking arise from the same binaural mechanisms but are otherwise not
closely related, or whether sound localization is the basis of spatial release from masking, particularly in
situations were targets and maskers are highly confusable with one another. It is an important question,
because listener complaints about hearing difficulties in noise might well be due to poor sound localization,
although this is not evaluated in clinical practice. While there have been hints of a causal relationship in the
literature, the question is a difficult one to answer and the field has not come to a consensus. This three-year
project will be the first that we are aware of to singularly and comprehensively focus on the relationship
between sound localization and spatial release from masking, using rigorous psychoacoustic methods with
recently developed signal processing tools and stimuli that dissociate binaural difference cues and perceived
intracranial location. The findings will help us make sense of the conflicting literature that has been difficult to
interpret, and will move the field toward theoretical and practical advances that will help inform professional
management of hearing loss and its consequences for listening in noise."

Genetically identical cells in the same environment can have large individual differences in gene
expression. This “single-cell variability” in gene expression diversifies cell types during development,
contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer cells, and hinders the production of pure cell types
in reprogramming protocols. Although single-cell variability is an important property of gene expression in
development and disease, the sequence features of promoters and the epigenetic features of
chromosomes that predict a gene’s single-cell variability are unknown. To address this gap, we propose
to develop a high-throughput technology that measures the single-cell variability of different classes of
promoters in diverse chromosomal environments. We propose to integrate transgenes into thousands of
locations across the genome and measure the resulting single-cell variability of transgene expression from
all locations in parallel. These data will allow us to leverage existing epigenomic maps to identify the
features of chromosomal environments that amplify or dampen single-cell variability in gene expression.
We propose to apply this technology to multiple cell types and with transgenes carrying diverse promoters.
The resulting data will be analyzed with a framework separates the independent contributions of promoters
and chromosomal environments to single-cell variability, and also quantifies any interactions between
specific promoters and chromosomal environments that impact single-cell variability. Our goal in
developing this technology is to understand the properties of the genome that control the single-cell
variability of mRNA expression."
10766770,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 This application proposes a five-year research career development program focused on determining how
glycosylation epitopes expressed during metaplasia and cancer contribute to these clinically significant cellular
transformations. The applicant, Jeffrey W. Brown, M.D., Ph.D., is an Instructor of Medicine in the Division of
Gastroenterology at Washington University School of Medicine. Since completing gastroenterology fellowship,
Dr. Brown had worked in the laboratory of Jason Mills, where he has discovered a novel cellular process that he
calls cathartocytosis [Greek: cellular cleansing] which is used by cells to efficiently dedifferentiate in the
processes of metaplasia and cancer. He has subsequently determined that cathartocytosis is annotated by the
glycan 3’-Sulfo-LeA/C and mice null for galectins that preferentially bind this epitope either fail to perform
cathartocytosis or fail to package sulfomucins into mature granules. As glycobiology is a new field for Dr. Brown,
Stuart Kornfeld will serve as his primary mentor with continued support from Jason Mills (Co-Mentor). Together,
the candidate will be uniquely positioned to acquire the knowledge and skill set necessary to develop an
independent research program investigating how specific glycosylation epitopes modulate tissue transformation
and differentiation states in metaplasia and cancer.
 The expression and secretion of sulfomucins is uniformly present in Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
cancer, is the defining feature of type III [high-risk] gastric intestinal metaplasia, and is currently the best
biomarker for detecting high-grade dysplasia and cancer in pancreatic cystic lesions. Using a comprehensive
approach involving cell lines, organoid culture, and murine models, the experiments proposed herein will
determine the proteome carrying 3’-Sulfo-LeA/C, the cellular signaling and transcriptional profile regulating its
synthesis and secretion, as well as the molecular mechanism by which specific galectins modulate cellular
differentiation. Ultimately, with the mentorship provided by Stuart Kornfeld, Jason Mills, and the research
advisory committee, the knowledge and technical skills derived from the proposed experiments, and completion
of the outlined career development plan, Dr. Brown will be well-prepared to establish an independent research
program and is expected to be highly-competitive for R01 funding."

Fibrillar nanostructures are prevalent in nature, ranging from information storage (DNA) and communication
(mRNA), to structure (collagen, amyloids) and pathology (collagen, amyloids, fibronectin). Many of these
structures (e.g., Amyloids) can have functional roles in organisms as well as participate in disease states.
These structures interact with many molecules in organisms; however, understanding these interactions is
challenging due to the need for appropriate chemical and physical tools that provide detailed fundamental
information on binding sites, dissociation constants, binding stoichiometry, and the topology of these
structures. Some of the techniques typically used by researchers give inconsistent and even erroneous results.
We are especially interested in amyloid structures since they are tough to study due to the large degree of
disorder (random-coil sidechains), making their analysis difficult using standard techniques such as NMR and
X-ray. To address these challenges, our overall goal for the next five years of research is to develop advanced
photochemical and photophysical strategies that will reveal important structural and affinity information about
biological nanofibrillar structures. The foundational work performed in our group led to the first example of a
metal dipyridophenazine complex for sensing amyloids using fluorescence spectroscopy. Later we showed that
metal complexes could be used to quantify a-synuclein nanoaggregates (a protein associated with Parkinson’s
disease) in cells. Combining biophysical and computational techniques, we proposed a site for molecular
binding in amyloid-b (between Val18 and Phe20) and a mechanism for the light-switching behavior of
ruthenium dipyridophenazine complexes. This binding site was later confirmed by selective photooxidation
(photochemical footprinting) using a rhenium complex, becoming the first experimentally confirmed binding site
in a full-length amyloid nanofibril. Ruthenium complexes were also used to detect and study soluble globular
oligomers (with high toxicity to neural cells) using fluorescence anisotropy. Currently, we have published more
than 15 papers in this area, 8 of which were published in top journals (JACS or higher); my research group has
published over 110 articles in 14 years at Rice University. Building on these advances, we will explore the use
of photochemical footprinting to elucidate binding sites in various amyloids and other fibrillar structures. We
anticipate studying dissociation constants and binding stoichiometry on fibrillar nanostructures using global
fitting of multiple saturation equations, providing a strategy to evaluate these important parameters correctly. In
the case of systems with multiple binding sites we will study the use of time-resolved spectroscopy to extract
the binding information for the different binding sites simultaneously. We will examine the rate of diffusion of
singlet oxygen as a way to determine topological distances, a parameter that is elusive to determine
experimentally. This research program will produce unprecedented information on fibrillar nanostructures,
specially amyloids, and provide new and much-needed strategies to interrogate biomolecules using light."

 Transposons are mobile genetic elements that provide an important mechanism for the acquisition of
pathogenesis functions and antibiotic resistance in bacteria. A family of these elements, Tn7 and Tn7-
like elements, tightly control transposition allowing them to be particularly successful across diverse
bacteria. On five distinct occasions discovered by the lab and collaborators these elements have
coopted CRISPR-Cas systems. CRISPR-Cas systems typically function as adaptive immune systems
in prokaryotes that utilize an RNA-based system to recognize and cleave viruses and other invading
DNA elements. In coopting CRISPR-Cas systems they were naturally adapted for guide RNA-directed
transposition suggesting promising new tools for programable editing. As an editing tool, CRISPR-Cas
transposons (CASTs) direct a single cargo DNA into a pre-programmed position in one orientation
without the negative side effects of inducing a double strand break in the target DNA. CAST enable
genome editing of bacteria, individually and in communities. They also have future potential for human
therapeutic gene editing. Despite the potential promise with the CAST systems, major questions
remain about how they function, which limits their broad application. By advancing our understanding
across diverse CAST systems we provide foundational knowledge to enable important genome and
population editing applications. Each of the four projects focuses on CAST systems based on different
families of Tn7-like elements that use different mechanisms of transposase assembly and activation.
This mechanistic understanding will be critical for optimizing these systems and adapting them to new
hosts. Understanding the basic features of all CAST systems will bring the field closer to the
aspirational goal of setting up a system where associations between a transposon and any CRISPR-
Cas system could be engineered de novo. Our work will additionally provide insight into canonical
CRISPR-Cas systems and the unappreciated widespread use of atypical guides for gene regulation.
The mechanistic understanding we gain with diverse CAST elements will allow also allow us to
understand the outsized role of Tn7 and Tn7-like elements in pathogens for the acquisition of antibiotic
resistance and virulence factors.
Relevance to Public Health: Public health will be served because we will provide the framework for
developing important new genome modification techniques that will be broadly applicable for gene
editing, especially for future human therapeutic gene editing. Fundamental information about these
systems will also help us understand molecular mechanisms that allow the evolution of pathogens and
multidrug resistant bacteria though the transfer of genetic information."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) perform dual roles in cells, acting as both destructive and constructive agents.
At high levels, intracellular ROS facilitate irreversible macromolecular damage and are associated with a range
of disease pathologies. At lower physiological levels, ROS play important roles in the activation of beneficial
signaling events through the reversible post-translational modification of cysteine and methionine residues.
Despite the emerging appreciation for ROS as constructive signaling agents, and the importance for functional
redox signaling in managing cellular ROS, relatively few redox-signaling pathways have been characterized.
Many proteins susceptible to oxidation have been cataloged. However, the consequences of oxidation and the
physiological outcomes have been established for only a limited number of these targets. We argue this central
knowledge gap limits larger efforts towards the development of effective therapeutics to help manage cellular
ROS. Since its inception, our research program has focused on broadening our knowledge of ROS-based
signaling events. Our overarching goal is to elucidate individual pathways activated by the modification of
protein cysteine and/or methionine by ROS. Our intent is to uncover and to characterize redox-signaling
components, including ROS sources, redox targets, and oxidation regulators, as well as the consequences
(outcomes) for signaling at the protein and physiological level. Our research efforts center on two focus areas:
(1) an analysis of the role for cysteine oxidation in managing ROS within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
(2) the study of the consequences of protein methionine oxidation (MetO) formation and reduction. Our prior
work established that oxidation of a conserved cysteine in the Hsp70 BiP alters its chaperone activity to sustain
ER function under elevated ROS conditions. Our ongoing work intends to broaden our understanding of redox
signaling at the ER and BiP oxidation, answering the questions: What are the local endogenous sources of
ROS in the ER that are sensed by BiP? How does BiP oxidation influence known ER stress response
pathways? In addition, we intend to bolster the fundamental understanding of MetO formation and resolution
in cells, focusing in parallel on what we consider the most prominent gaps in our knowledge of MetO: What are
the physiological targets of MetO? What is the role for methionine sulfoxide reductases in regulating individual
protein MetO events throughout the cell? By answering these questions, we intend to provide insight into the
basic cell functions used to manage cellular ROS and avert cellular damage. We anticipate that our experience
and expertise, coupled with a diversity of personnel and scientific approaches, will allow us to make sustained
research progress over this MIRA award."

The long-term goals of the Das lab are to identify the fundamental biochemical mechanisms underlying lipid
metabolism and lipid-like xenobiotics such as cannabinoids. In the backdrop of growing recognition of lipids in
the body and sparse knowledge of their biochemistry and function, the Das lab research program addresses the
following two broad goals: (1) to understand the mechanism of how membrane proteins metabolize lipids and
lipid-like xenobiotics, and (2) to identify novel lipid metabolites that are formed from the metabolism and elucidate
their pharmacology with respect to receptor interactions that are involved in immunomodulation. To execute
these research goals, Das lab uses diverse set of innovative methodologies spanning from chemical synthesis,
recombinant membrane protein expression, nanodiscs, targeted and untargeted lipidomics mass spectrometry,
UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, imaging platforms, mammalian cell culture and
receptor pharmacological studies. The project falls under the broader NIGMS mission as the elucidation of the
basic mechanisms of membrane protein interactions with lipids and lipid-like xenobiotics will lay the foundation
for the development of therapeutics for different diseases. The laboratory established in 2012 has been NIGMS
funded and have published 52 papers from the independent laboratory focusing on CYP mediated metabolism
of lipids. The work was recognized by four national awards and numerous opportunities to deliver talks at
conferences and other academic institutions. Previously, the Das lab have combined use of cross-disciplinary
approaches to understand the role of the lipid endocannabinoid metabolism by membrane-bound enzymes to
synthesize novel metabolites that effect neuroinflammation. Overall, the laudable quality of our research program
has been identification of important scientific problems, proposal of diverse solutions and finding collaborators
to translate and strengthen the research question and approach. Using the tools and approaches developed in
previous NIGMS funding, we will leverage support from the MIRA to understand the biochemistry of new orphan
cytochrome P450s expressed during diseases states and involved in lipid metabolism. The strength in our
studies lies in the central hypothesis that P450 mediated metabolism of both lipids and cannabinoids leads to
the formation of bioactive molecules that are promising scaffold to develop therapeutics to treat immune
diseases. Altogether, the proposal research will comprehensively address the mechanism of lipid membrane
protein interactions leading to the formation of large repertoire of lipid metabolites that are involved in controlling
systemic inflammation."
10765514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The major goal of our research program is to unravel mechanisms and detect errors during processing of
repetitive DNA or RNA sequences that could lead to genomic instability and cell dysfunction. A considerable
fraction of the genome in nearly all organisms consists of repetitive DNA sequences. It has been suggested
that these repetitive sequences play a role in several cellular processes. However, repetitive DNA sequences
can adopt non-conventional DNA and RNA structures, which can be a challenge for the DNA replication,
transcription and translation machinery to travel through and process correctly. Prolonged stalling of the
replication forks in human cells can have severe consequences, such as genome instability that include
chromosome fragility, genomic mutations and expansions of these repeat sequences. Also, repetitive
sequences located in the mRNA can interfere with translation and lead to aberrant protein expression. Several
neurological and muscular diseases are caused by repeat expansions. To avoid genomic instability at
repetitive sequences human cells employ several mechanisms to prevent genomic alterations, cell death and
diseases. BRCA1 is one of such proteins, which is involved in several molecular pathways including DNA
repair and DNA replication. However, it is not clear how much BRCA1 is needed to fulfill all BRCA1 functions
properly, and which back-up mechanisms are activated in cells with 50% of BRCA1 expression. In addition,
repetitive sequences in the mRNA can trigger repeat-associated non-UTG (RAN)-initiated translation leading to
the generation of abnormal polypeptides that form inclusions in human cells and cause several neurological,
ovarian and muscular disorders. However, the mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction, cell death and repeat
expansions induced by these abnormal inclusions are not clearly understood. In addition, it is not known which
trans factors and mechanisms promote repeat expansion in human cells. Aberrant inclusions could sequester
or dysregulate nuclear repair proteins causing DNA damage, cell dysfunction and apoptosis. In this MIRA
application we seek to determine these mechanisms and DNA repair pathways leading to genomic instability in
proliferating cells and large repeat expansion in non-proliferating human oocytes. The expected outcome of
this studies will be new knowledge how repetitive DNA and RNA sequences induce genomic instability and cell
dysfunction in so far rare studied human cells."

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy in which the primary risk factor is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
Dysregulation of conventional outflow homeostasis results in elevated IOP. Key elements of outflow homeostasis
are the turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM), which also determines preferential flow passageways through the
tissue. In fact, there is recent evidence of differential ECM gene expression between regions of low and high
flow in the trabecular meshvvork (TM). In cancer, dysregulation of ECM homeostasis has been demonstrated to
involve extracellular nanovesicles, known as exosomes. Exosome release is tightly regulated, and they are
differentiated from other nanovesicles based on their size, cell type-specific function and cargo. Amongst others,
their functions include waste management, cell-cell signaling and ECM turnover. As a result, we hypothesize
that exosomes released from TM cells play a role in opsonizing ECM in the outflow pathway, contributing
to segmental flow, and altered ECM homeostasis in glaucoma. This study aims to investigate the role of
exosomes in regulating ECM by human TM cells and in TM tissues. During the independent phase, I will examine
how IOP effects exosome release and regulation in the conventional outflow pathway in terms of segmental flow.
Next, using human TM cells and TM tissues, I will investigate how exosomes can be used to ameliorate a
glaucoma phenotype and ocular hypertension. As outcomes of this research we expect to (i) identify a role for
exosomes in segmental flow (ii) determine the effect of IOP on exosome release and function (iii) identify ECM
targets for exosome regulation and, (iv) ascertain if exosomes can be used to normalize ECM homeostasis."
10782608,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sensory experience shapes the maturation of neural circuits during critical periods of development. How early-
life experience modifies synaptic connectivity to refine sensory information processing remains a central question
in neurobiology. Neurons respond to external sensory experience through the rapid, activity-dependent
transcription of immediate early gene (IEG) transcription factors (TFs), such as Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Once
expressed, IEGs regulate a wave of late-response genes (LRGs) that mediate the influence of activity on synaptic
remodeling in a cell type-specific manner. In particular, activity-dependent transcription of the neurotrophin
Bdnf/BDNF within excitatory neurons establishes the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in the visual
cortex by promoting the formation of inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neuron cell bodies. However, specific
mechanisms by which BDNF mediates this unique form of synaptic plasticity, known as somatic inhibition, remain
poorly understood. Although BDNF influences gene transcription, whether BDNF regulates transcription within
specific neuron types to direct inhibitory synapses onto neuronal soma is not yet known. This project seeks to
identify and characterize the genomic mechanisms by which BDNF regulates somatic inhibition in the mouse
visual cortex. Aim 1 of this proposal uses a transgenic mouse line that lacks activity-dependent Bdnf transcription
to identify BDNF-regulated genes and gene regulatory elements during visual cortex development. The
experiments in Aim 1 test the hypothesis that BDNF regulates the transcription of key synaptic organizer genes
in a cell type-specific manner to drive the formation of somatic inhibitory synapses. Aim 2 of this proposal seeks
to identify specific IEG TFs that mediate the effects of BDNF on transcriptional activation. Recently, I discovered
that the neuron-specific IEG TF, Egr4/EGR4, preferentially responds to BDNF in primary cortical neurons and
binds the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex in vitro. In this aim, I will use immunoprecipitation mass
spectrometry and CUT&RUN to determine the interaction partners and genomic binding sites of EGR4 in mouse
visual cortex. Given that NuA4/TIP60 both activates transcription and repairs transcription-coupled DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs), I will further test the hypothesis that EGR4 mediates BDNF-dependent DSB repair.
Collectively, the proposed studies will provide novel insights into how BDNF regulates the maturation of cortical
circuits and, more broadly, how neurons achieve stimulus-specific transcriptional regulation and genomic
maintenance. Improved understanding of these processes will inform the study of neurological disorders that
display a loss of BDNF production, including Alzheimer’s and Huntingtin’s disease."

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Summer Research Fellowship Program is a cancer
education program that enables 30 first- and second-year U.S. medical students to participate in laboratory and
clinical research under the mentorship of MSK’s clinical faculty. Launched in 1977, this program has enabled
approximately 1,610 medical students to contribute to the research enterprise of a premier academic medical
center. Program participants can work with mentors and in labs centrally involved in both basic and clinical
research; attend MSK’s abundant didactic opportunities; learn how to blend lessons from science and clinical
practice; and present their work to a range of audiences.
The MSK Summer Research Fellowship Program helps address two significant challenges in the field of
oncology.
• The need for more oncologists, especially physician-scientists: In a 2014 report, the American
 Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) projected a shortage of oncologists over the next decade due to
 several factors, including the aging population and an aging oncology workforce. Also, in 2014, the NIH
 issued a report that anticipates that the rising generation of physician-scientists will be insufficient to
 replace those nearing retirement age. The rapidly advancing field of cancer care requires an oncology
 workforce of appropriately trained and engaged physician-scientists that can maintain the pace of
 translation research developments. This program aims to ameliorate this shortage by engaging students’
 interest in oncology research careers.
• The need for more physicians from underrepresented minority populations: The report from ASCO
 described a need for greater racial and ethnic diversity in the physician workforce. This program has
 been able to grow in both size and diversity through the support of MSK’s Office of Diversity Programs.
 In the most recent grant cycle, approximately half of our participants were from underrepresented minority
groups."
10782612,"Pertussis is a re-emerging public health concern, and its resurgence is correlated with a switch from whole-cell
to acellular vaccines, which prevent disease, but not colonization or transmission of the causative agent
Bordetella pertussis. In order to limit the mortality and morbidity associated with pertussis, particularly in infants,
a combination of more effective vaccines and antibiotic therapies are needed. Their development requires a
better understanding of the molecular basis for Bordetella pertussis pathogenicity. We are proposing
experiments that will answer longstanding questions regarding the secretory mechanism of Filamentous
hemagglutinin (FhaB), a critical virulence factor for Bordetella pertussis and to identify peptides which
inhibit FhaB secretion.
FhaB mediates adherence to mammalian respiratory epithelial cells, suppresses the inflammatory response and
is required for Bordetella to persist in the murine respiratory tract. FhaB is a TpsA protein secreted by the TpsB
protein FhaC. FhaBC are the model for two-partner secretion (TPS) systems. TPS systems are broadly
distributed among Gram-negative bacteria and many have proven or postulated roles in virulence.
TpsB proteins are part of the Omp85 superfamily which also includes outer membrane protein assembly factors
such BamA. Due to the complex topology and large size of FhaB and other TpsA effectors, no structures of
active TpsB transporters in complex with their effectors have been solved. The lack of structural information has
limited our understanding of how TpsB proteins interact with TpsA passengers and complicates the design of
effective anti-microbials targeting these systems.
We propose to: 1) Determine the mechanism and structure of the early stages of FhaB secretion by FhaC using
a simplified FhaB/FhaC system that we have developed in E. coli and 2) screen a large library (>1012) of cyclic
peptides to identify those that bind and inhibit FhaC.
This is a collaborative project that takes advantage of the expertise and resources of the Cotter and Doyle
laboratories. The results of this work will lay the foundation for a substantial collaboration between the two groups
investigating the molecular basis for the TPS mechanism and identification of antimicrobial compounds targeting
these systems in Gram negative pathogens."
10782622,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heparin is administered as an anti-coagulant to approximately 10 million patients annually, placing it among the
most frequently utilized clinical interventions in the US. About 3% of patients that receive heparin generate
antibodies that cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Antibodies that cause HIT are especially
dangerous due to their ability to bind platelet/PF4 complexes on the surface of platelets and stimulate platelet
activation and thrombosis. Unfortunately, patients with HIT have a very high mortality rate (~10-25%), even with
treatment. The crucial knowledge gap limiting the optimal diagnosis and treatment of HIT is that the platelet
components that recruit PF4 to the platelet surface to elicit the epitopes recognized by HIT antibodies have yet
to be discovered. Aim 1 of this proposal will identify the platelet components that recruit PF4 to the platelet
surface and quantify differences in their expression based on age, sex, and ethnicity to better risk stratify patients
and identify candidates that can be targeted to improve HIT treatment. Identifying the platelet molecules that
recruit PF4 to platelets will also define a set of antigenic targets to improve diagnostic enzyme-based
immunoassays (EIAs) for HIT. EIAs are used as the frontline diagnostic tool for HIT but have a poor positive
predictive value (~50%), necessitating the use of platelet-based assays to confirm the presence of platelet-
activating antibodies. Improving the accuracy of HIT EIAs would eliminate the need to perform platelet-based
confirmatory assays and significantly shorten the time to diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.
Because only approximately 50% of HIT patients develop thromboses, we hypothesize an inhibitory platelet
mechanism limits HIT antibody-mediated thrombosis. As a proof-of-principle, we fractionated platelet granule
components and found that glycosaminoglycan-rich proteoglycan fractions specifically inhibit HIT antibody-
mediated platelet activation. Aim 2 of this proposal will identify the platelet components that selectively inhibit
antibody-mediated platelet activation and will leverage this discovery to develop improved HIT therapeutics.
Our preliminary data also identified a subclass of HIT patients who test negative in diagnostic EIAs but positive
in platelet activation assays. Because platelet activation assays are typically only performed after a positive EIA,
this subclass of patients may be significantly underdiagnosed using current HIT diagnostic workflows. Aim 3 of
this proposal will assess the efficacy of current HIT diagnostic strategies by defining the frequency of HIT-
suspected patients that test serologically negative in EIAs but positive in platelet activation assays. Aim 3 will
also establish the pathogenicity of this HIT antibody subclass in a humanized murine model of HIT.
The long-term goals of this study are to better understand HIT pathogenesis, including the age, sex, and
ethnicity-driven factors impacting HIT severity, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of HIT by identifying
platelet components that 1) recruit PF4 to the platelet surface to elicit the epitopes recognized by HIT antibodies,
and 2) participate in an inhibitory feedback mechanism that attenuates HIT antibody-mediated platelet activation."

ABSTRACT
 The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory conference on Genome Informatics will focus on the development
and utilization of large-scale genomic data and annotations. Genomic resources provide the fundamental
descriptions of an increasing array of organisms at the molecular level. This meeting forms part of a series that
alternates annually between Cold Spring Harbor, USA and Hinxton, UK. The goal of the series is to explore both
the latest provision of these resources, and perhaps most importantly, their use as engines of biological
discovery. This ranges from the storage of data and their associated data models, to the design of effective
algorithms to uncover non-obvious aspects of these datasets, to ontologies to concisely describe biological
information, and software systems to support curation, visualization, and exploration. The conference also covers
the use of genomics in combination with various imaging applications and the latest attempts to understand
microbial pathogenesis based on genomics. The conference has expanded its remit over the last few years, to
ensure it remains current with the latest applications of informatics, all the while ensuring a strong focus on
biological informatics. The conference brings together some of the leading scientists in this growing field, and
we strongly encourage researchers from other large scale information handling disciplines to attend."

Birth defects are a major contributor to infant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs in the U.S., but the
etiologies of these conditions remain unknown for most individuals, which has hindered development of
population-level prevention strategies. Thus, a critical next step in the national birth defect research agenda is
to better understand the parental and infant determinants of these conditions to identify and implement
strategies to reduce birth defect-related morbidity and mortality. As a founding member of the National Birth
Defects Prevention Study (i.e., the predecessor of the Birth Defects Study to Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS
(BD-STEPS), the Texas Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention has helped advance birth defects
research and prevention since the founding of the Texas Birth Defects Registry in 1996. The Center represents
a collaboration between the Texas Birth Defects Registry at the Texas Department of State Health Services,
UTHealth School of Public Health, and Baylor College of Medicine. The addition of our geographic region to
BD-STEPS recruitment pool would allow for increased diversity, particularly among Mexican Americans, one of
the fastest-growing racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. By leveraging one of the largest birth defects registries in
the world, our team has extensive experience in birth defects surveillance and epidemiology, and an
exceptional track-record for both generating publications (N>500) that have contributed toward elucidation of
birth defects risk factors and training the next generations of birth defects researchers. Building upon our
strong infrastructure for patient recruitment, data collection, and epidemiologic analyses, we now propose to
contribute our experience and resources to BD-STEPS by collaborating with our long-term partners from other
states to advance the study’s data collection and impact, through research and training. Our Center’s particular
research areas include 1) social determinants of health (led by the Texas Department of State Health
Services); 2) genetic risk factors (led by Baylor College of Medicine); and 3) occupational exposures (led
by UT Health School of Public Health). Thus, we are well-positioned to conduct, publish, and present at least
seven proposed research studies designed to identify associations with these and other exposures in BD-
STEPS and to improve understanding of the specific mechanisms that underlie risk for particular birth defects.
At its conclusion, we expect this work will have expanded the list of potentially modifiable maternal exposures
that are known to be associated with the risk of birth defects, contributed new knowledge that will aid in the
design of risk reduction strategies, and empower the development of doctoral and post-doctoral trainees and
junior faculty members. Most importantly, it is expected that these outputs will ultimately translate to a
reduction in the prevalence of birth defects and improved health among infants born with these conditions."
10772182,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no cure that affects >50 millions of
people worldwide. Emerging evidence supports that accumulation of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria in the
central nervous system is an early, central pathology. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by dysfunctional
mitochondria cause oxidative damages to proteins, lipids and DNA and exacerbate the key pathologies of
amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein in a vicious cycle. In stark contrast,
endurance exercise (i.e., running) or resistance exercise (i.e., weightlifting) have significant preventive and
therapeutic impacts on AD. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. AMP-dependent
protein kinase (AMPK), a master energy sensor, has emerged as a promising regulator underlying the superb
benefits of exercise. AMPK is primarily expressed in neurons in the hippocampus, and its activity is reduced in
animal models of AD. Importantly, endurance exercise restores AMPK activity with reduced Aβ deposition along
with restored spatial learning and memory. A promising but untested mechanism is exercise-induced mitophagy,
a selective degradation of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria under the control of AMPK and its downstream
unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase (Ulk1), resulting in improved mitochondrial quality. We hypothesize that
endurance and/or resistance exercise promotes AMPK-Ulk1 activation and mitophagy, hence removing
damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria in adult hippocampal neurons and preventing neurodegeneration
and cognitive decline in AD. To test this hypothesis, we propose:
1. To determine whether AMPK-Ulk1 activation is required for exercise-mediated protection against AD.
2. To ascertain whether AMPK activation is sufficient to protect against AD.
The proposed studies are hypothesis-driven and supported by previously published and preliminary findings with
strong scientific premises. We have also developed unique exercise and genetic models along with mitochondrial
reporter mice to address the importance and regulation of exercise-induced mitophagy against AD. The findings
will pave the way for developing effective therapeutics targeting AMPK and mitophagy for AD."

 Our research aims to understand the role of serotonin modulated mitochondrial biogenesis in diabetes,
depression, and dementia (Alzheimer's disease, AD). Diabetes and depression are independent risk factors for
dementia and worsen the dementia pathology and therapeutic response. Depression comorbidity impaired
metabolic function such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress results in
physical depression and cognitive impairment. Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter that performs
synaptic transmission, plasticity, energy homeostasis in aging and dementia. For a long time, it is known that
the brainstem harbors unique neurons to synthesize and project serotonin to the entire central nervous system.
However, molecular links between serotonin levels and mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics,
mitophagy/autophagy in dementia, diabetes, and depression are not entirely understood. It is established that
serotonin synthesis in dorsal raphe is protective and essential for cell homeostasis and energy metabolism. It
has been hypothesized that low serotonin levels induce defective mitochondrial biogenesis, impaired
mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy/autophagy in depression,
diabetes, and dementia, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as citalopram treatment reverses
defective mitochondrial biogenesis and all mitochondrial defective aspects. We have conceptualized the study
in rodents focusing on the transgenic models of 3Ds focusing hippocampus (APP, Tau, HT22 cells),
hypothalamus (DbDb, mHypo cells), and raphe (TPH2/ko, RN46A-B14 cells). Therefore, the current study
proposes to understand the pathologies and the protective effects of citalopram (SSRI) against defective
mitochondrial biogenesis, impaired mitochondrial dynamics, and defective mitophagy/autophagy. The outcome
of our proposed experiments will provide new insights into the role of serotonin in depression, diabetes, and
dementia concerning mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial function, and
mitophagy/autophagy. The outcome will also provide beneficial effects of citalopram against common
serotonin-induced defects of mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial function, and mitophagy/autophagy."
10766839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In addition to its well-established role in motor control, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized as a regulator
of limbic functions, including goal-directed behavior and affective learning. The mechanistic contribution of the
cerebellum to these functions remains unclear but is hypothesized to involve mnemonic processing, timing of
responses, and/or computation of prediction errors, which drive behavior and learning. Our ability to test these
hypotheses depends on two things: establishment of a well-defined cerebellum-relevant behavioral paradigm;
and knowledge of the underlying long-range circuits that connect the cerebellum to essential limbic brain
centers. Our preliminary data demonstrate that we have accomplished both: first, we have identified extinction
of learned fear as a suitable paradigm for these studies. Second, our investigations of the anatomical and
functional blueprints of cerebellar circuits have revealed the existence of disynaptic connectivity between (1)
the cerebellum and the amygdala and (2) the cerebellum and nucleus accumbens. The goal of this project is to
dissect the structure and function of these cerebello-limbic circuits and to define their role in learned behavior.
In Aims 1 and 2, we will use circuit tracing, single-cell sequencing and optophysiology to define the
fundamental functional properties of individual cell types that comprise these cerebellar circuits and link them
to positional and transcriptomic profiles. In Aim 3, we will use in vivo manipulation of the activity of individual
circuit elements and measurements of neural activity to pinpoint the contribution of cerebello-limbic circuits to
extinction of learned behavior. Our multi-level interrogation of cerebello-limbic connectivity will greatly increase
our understanding of its contributions to non-motor functionality and may provide insight into the
(dys)regulation of learned fear, which is prevalent in diseases such as post-traumatic stress disorder."

Health (NIH) research training grants that have supported the training of researchers in Nigerian universities.
Research on HIV in Nigeria has contributed significantly to the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV
in the country as well to the development of international guidelines worldwide. The University of Nigeria Nsukka
(UNN) College of Medicine has implemented multiple HIV research projects mostly as a sub-awardee. Findings
from our rapid needs assessment with 84 UNN researchers and research administrators indicated that 93% of
researchers expressed interest in submitting grant applications, including for HIV research, but only 28% knew
who to contact for proposal and submission support at UNN. For UNN to successfully submit and manage grant
applications as a prime institution, there is need to strengthen its research administration and management
infrastructure. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) further identify needs and gaps in research administration
and management at UNN; 2) improve the grants management and proposal development knowledge and skills
of UNN research administrators and HIV implementation researchers; and 3) strengthen the ability of UNN
research administrators and HIV implementation researchers to submit and manage successful HIV grant
applications by providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. UC
San Diego experts in research administration and grant management will implement the objectives of the
proposed infrastructure development training program. The proposed program will be led by Dr. Gregory Aarons,

Remarkably, neither the molecular mechanism of action of NS5A-i nor the exact molecular functions of NS5A specifically targeted by NS5A-i are known. The goal of this application is to address this major gap in the HCV field by testing our central hypothesis that NS5A-i block NS5A high-order oligomers (h-oligomers), which have a direct role in membrane remodeling for the double membrane vesicles (DMV) formation during HCV replication. Our preliminary study showed that NS5A-i could disrupt the high-order oligomers formed by NS5A-N-terminal domain (NS5A-NTD). In addition, by using an innovative confocal time-lapse imaging system, we obtained evidence that NS5A-i could inhibit NS5A- NTD-mediated membrane remodeling. Armed with these preliminary data supporting our hypothesis, we will now define NS5A h-oligomerization and membrane remodeling as a direct target of NS5A-i by using a novel in vitro model system in Specific Aim 1. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate the role of different domains of NS5A in NS5A h-oligomer-dependent membrane remodeling in vitro and DMV formation in NS5A expressing cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the role of cholesterol in NS5A-mediated membrane remodeling. The outcome of this project could have a broad impact on the field for other viruses that generate membrane-protected replication compartments, as well as rational drug design for NS5A-like targets."
10781009,"Project Summary
The body has innate mechanisms to increase cardiac function under varying physiologic conditions. Inotropes,
a class of heart failure drugs, utilize these mechanisms to therapeutically improve cardiac function. Some
inotropes, however, are safe while others increase the risk of side effects like arrhythmias. This is an intriguing
question when considering two drugs that improve heart function by inhibiting phosphodiesterases (PDEs).
PDE inhibition mechanistically increases cyclic nucleotide cAMP levels and thus activate protein kinase A
(PKA) cell signaling pathways in the heart. Pharmacologic inhibition of PDEs 1 or 3 augments cardiac function.
Chronic PDE3 inhibition (PDE3i), however, increases fatal arrhythmias in patients. While the arrhythmogenic
effects of chronic PDE1i remains unknown, acute inhibition is safe. We do not yet fully understand how PDE 1
or 3 inhibition mechanisms differ to explain these differences. The goal of this study is to uncover fundamental
cardiac contractility mechanisms that distinguish the actions of the two inotropes. We test the central
hypothesis that appropriate compartmentalized control of cAMP/PKA signaling will accomplish specified
improvement in cardiac contractility. This is supported by our prior findings that PDE3i activated PKA signaling
to increase L-type calcium channel (LTCC) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium load, but that PDE1i
selectively augmented LTCC activity. And while β-blockers abrogated the inotropic effects of PDE3i, the effects
for PDE1i persisted. In preliminary data, we show that sarcolemmal cAMP is predominantly hydrolyzed by
PDE1 in living myocytes. Furthermore, PDE4, but not PDE1, inhibition synergistically increase cAMP that is
produced upon β-adrenergic receptor stimulation. The investigation of compartmentalized myocardial
contractility mechanisms in health and disease will be divided into three aims. In Aim 1, we will delineate cyclic
nucleotides-activated pathways downstream of PDE1 inhibition that increase LTCC function. This will be done
using biosensors of cAMP, cGMP, and PKA in isolated myocytes using Forster resonance energy transfer
(FRET) imaging. LTCC function will be tested using patch clamping. Healthy, heart failure guinea pigs, and
genetically modified mice will be used. Aim 2 will investigate the role of cell excitation and calcium cycling as
mechanisms for PDE1i inotropy. We will test ion fluxes across the sarcolemmal membrane and SR combining
patch clamping and confocal imaging using calcium indicators in guinea pig myocytes. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
evaluate the arrhythomogenic effects of long-term PDE1i and expose any potential mechanisms in comparison
to chronic PDE3i. Healthy or heart failure guinea pigs treated with PDE1 or PDE3 inhibitor will undergo ex vivo
optical mapping mechanocoupling study or serial, conscious electrocardiogram study using telemetry device.
PDE1i has completed clinical evaluation in heart failure patients. Thus, understanding how these PKA
signaling pathways differ will critically guide future trial designs. Moreover, using rational design from the
knowledge this study produces, we can refine the next generation of inotropes and other heart failure drugs."
10747075,"1 Background: Every day, older Veterans receiving VA-financed home care experience unacceptably high rates
 2 of health-related adverse events (e.g., infections and injuries), many of which, if their early warning signs are
 3 caught, can be prevented. Patients with both dementia and other chronic conditions are at even higher risk.
 4 Home care prevents costly nursing home placement and maintains patients in their environment of choice. Yet
 5 family caregivers and home care agency workers, who provide home care do not receive training to detect
 6 early warning signs, because available training does not target these providers. And VA patient safety
 7 initiatives using high-reliability organization (HRO) principles targets only VA-owned health care facilities. This
 8 CDA-2, informed by HRO principles, will fill this gap and addresses early warning signs of adverse events in
 9 home care. The CDA-2 will estimate prevalence rates of potentially avoidable hospitalization in home care;
10 assess the roles of family caregivers, home care agency workers, and VA clinical teams, in the recognition of
11 early warning signs; and adapt a solution to detect early warning signs. My background in gerontology and
12 preliminary work funded by my VISN 1 CDA partially prepare me for this work. But I need additional training in
13 non-VA data sources and advanced statistical methods for causal inference, mixed methods, care
14 coordination, and cutting-edge user-centered design to advance my career and have the CDA-2 succeed.
15 Specific Aims: My proposal fills training gaps and provides VA with rigorous, actionable research. With
16 operational partner Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care, I will achieve 3 aims with my mentors and
17 statistical experts: (1) estimate rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations in home care and assess how
18 their prevention is related to home care and VA clinical team characteristics; (2) produce in-depth knowledge of
19 home care processes through which family caregivers, home care agency workers/supervisors, and VA
20 clinicians prevent early warning signs from escalating; and (3) adapt and pilot an existing tool to bolster the
21 detection of early warning signs in the home.
22 Methods: Aim 1: Use of Medicare (non-VA) and VA databases will enable me to estimate potentially avoidable
23 hospitalizations in my study population and assess whether their prevention is associated with types of home
24 care and VA clinical teams. Aim 2: Using mixed-methods (in-depth interviews and surveys) at 3 VAMCs
25 selected for rates estimated from Aim 1 data, I will examine multiple processes, including care coordination,
26 through which family caregivers, home care agency workers, and VA clinical team members recognize and
27 manage early warning signs. Aim 3: I will use evidence from the literature and Aim 2 findings to implement a
28 user-centered design approach to adapt and pilot an existing tool to enhance family caregivers and home care
29 agency workers’ ability to recognize early warning signs while mitigating unintended negative consequences.
30 Expected Results and Next Steps: I will provide my partners with deliverables to guide home care policy and
31 quality improvement initiatives and support family caregivers and home care agency workers and VA clinical
32 team practices to manage early warning signs. I will leverage my patient safety expertise and health equity
33 expertise will support future studies to examine VA and community resources to prevent other types of adverse
34 outcomes among home care patients (abuse/neglect) and to use a hybrid type I design to evaluate
35 effectiveness and implementation of the refined tool to recognize early warning signs.
36 Significance & Relevance to Veterans’ Health: Coming at a critical juncture in my VA research career, this
37 timely study of home care safety will help VA fulfill its promise of excellent patient safety. Home care safety is
38 in urgent need of improvement as home care expands to meet the growing needs of an aging Veteran
39 population who overwhelmingly prefers to receive long-term care at home. This CDA-2 will facilitate my growth

Obesity in pregnancy increases the risk for excessive adiposity in offspring, which tracks into adulthood and
can perpetuate across generations. Our preliminary data and published studies indicate that exercise initiated
during pregnancy in sedentary women with obesity lowers infant BMI z-scores and body fat percentage. These
benefits to infant health are more profound with resistance exercise during pregnancy. However, there are few
mechanistic studies in humans aimed at discerning mechanisms of maternal exercise-induced changes to
infant cellular metabolism. Our findings support the use of infant umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) as a model to explore offspring cellular phenotypes in humans. Importantly, these MSCs are of
the same lineage that derive postnatal tissues and thus, can be differentiated into mesodermal cell types
important for regulating whole-body metabolism, such as myocytes and adipocytes. We have evidence of
improved cellular phenotype in infant MSCs exposed to maternal aerobic exercise (AE) with the greatest
improvements in MSC metabolism from maternal resistance exercise (RE). The objective of the proposed
study is to determine if maternal exercise mitigates the adverse consequences of gestational obesity exposure
using the MSC model in an ancillary study from a parent grant that is randomizing pregnant women with
obesity to AE, RE, or usual care control. A secondary objective is to determine if the MSC metabolic profiles
are associated with infant whole-body health outcomes at 1-, 6-, and 12-months of age. We will test this
hypothesis in 64 subjects from the parent trial. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of maternal exercise in
women with obesity on infant MSC substrate metabolism and bioenergetic efficiency. These data will be
associated with infant whole-body resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation via indirect calorimetry
over the first year of life. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of maternal exercise mode in women with obesity
on infant MSC adipogenesis and lipid storage. These data will be associated with infant body composition as
measured by DXA over the first year of life. In Aim 3, MSCs will undergo a multiomics approach where we will
identify candidate genes and epigenetic signatures of maternal exercise mode. These outcomes will be
correlated with blood metabolomic measures in the infant to establish gene-metabolite pathways. Leveraging a
large, rigorous RCT in pregnant women with obesity, this will be the first study to identify how maternal
exercise affects offspring cellular metabolism. This work will have significant impact by translating infant
cellular metabolic data with whole-body metabolic data across the first year of life."
10762662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune challenges engage neural circuits to evoke stereotyped behavioral and physiological responses. For
example, infections evoked neuronally orchestrated sickness symptoms that include fever, lethargy, decreased
appetite, nausea, and cough. Likewise, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis evoke neuronal responses that
include nausea, cardiorespiratory changes, and sensations of discomfort and pain. Despite their medical
importance, little is understood about (1) how the brain detects the presence of an allergen, (2) what neural
circuits are engaged, and (3) what sympathetic and parasympathetic motor programs control autonomic
physiology and immune responses. In this project, we will chart communication mechanisms between the
immune and nervous systems that underlie neuronal responses to allergens. We have assembled an
expansive genetic toolkit to study neurons involved in neuro-immune crosstalk and the gut-brain axis. We will
use state-of-the-art neurogenetic approaches such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, in vivo imaging, fiber
photometry, targeted neuron ablation, and anatomical mapping to study the role of allergen-activated neural
circuits roles in physiology and behavior. We hypothesize that specific sensory and motor neuron types
contribute to food allergen-evoked behavioral and physiological changes. Characterizing allergen-activated
neurons will provide an essential foundation for mechanistic study and potentially therapy design."

10762419,"PROJECT SUMMARY: An emerging paradigm suggests that gut glycosylation is a key force in maintaining a
homeostatic relationship between the gut and its microbiota. Nevertheless, it is unclear how host glycosylation
machinery contributes to HIV-associated microbial translocation and inflammation. Our published data show that
the host circulating glycome is altered in HIV+ individuals, and that these changes persist despite antiretroviral
therapy (ART). In particular, we observe a persistent HIV-associated loss of sialic acid (hypo-sialylation) from
plasma glycoproteins. This suggested to us that HIV infection may also be associated with glycomic alterations
in other body compartments, including the gut. We therefore used ileum and sigmoid colon biopsies from 20
HIV+ ART-suppressed individuals and found that gut glycomic patterns are indeed associated with distinct
microbial compositions, markers of inflammation, and HIV persistence. In particular, we found that: (1) Increased
levels of mucosal-associated, hypo-sialylated O glycans correlated with a dysbiotic and less diverse gut
microbiome, higher plasma levels of inflammatory markers, and higher levels of ileum-associated HIV DNA.
These data are intriguing because non-HIV studies show that sialic acid catabolism (removal, via sialidase)
drives microbial dysbiosis/translocation and intestinal inflammation. (2) Increased levels of fucosylated glycans
correlated with higher microbiome diversity, lower dysbiosis, and lower inflammation. These correlations are
consistent with reports, in the general population, that gut fucosylation sustains host-commensal symbiosis and
prevents gut inflammation by suppressing bacterial virulence genes. We hypothesize that HIV infection causes
persistent gut glycomic alterations – mainly hypo-sialylation and lack of proper fucosylation (dys-fucosylation) –
that alter microbiome composition, leading to microbial translocation, inflammation, and HIV persistence.
In Aim 1A, we will determine the impact of SIV infection on the gut glycome and the effects of this impact on
microbiome composition and function, inflammation, and viral persistence, using longitudinal samples from 18
pig-tailed macaques. We will also test the mechanistic hypothesis that enhanced activity of gut sialidase, and/or
increased expression of fucose-regulated bacterial virulence genes, contribute to SIV-associated microbial
translocation. In Aim 1B, we will determine the impact of ART-treated HIV infection on the gut glycome, using
cross-sectional samples from 40 HIV+ ART-suppressed individuals and well-matched HIV- controls. In Aim 2
and based on non-HIV studies demonstrating that sialidase inhibitor or L-fucose reduces microbial translocation
and gut inflammation, we will test the hypothesis that treatment with sialidase inhibitor or L-fucose would reduce
SIV-mediated microbial translocation and inflammation using SIV+ ART+ macaques. Our work aims to create a
new paradigm, namely that host glycosylation is a key force that shapes the microbiome during ART-suppressed
HIV infection. We propose that exploiting this mechanism will allow the design of novel strategies to manipulate
these forces to reduce HIV persistence and/or prevent/delay the development of HIV-associated co-morbidities."
10762422,"PROJECT SUMMARY
My career goal is to lead efforts to improve gait rehabilitation and mitigate falls risk in older adults by
conducting innovative research focused on the neural control and enhancement of gait and mobility. I am
particularly interested in developing individualized, multi-modal, and patient-centered interventions that can
both stand alone and be combined with current evidenced-based geriatrics rehabilitation programming.
Though walking is a repetitive task, one’s temporospatial patterns of movement during walking vary from stride
to stride. This gait variability, if sufficiently high, is predictive of both falls and cognitive decline in older adults.
Still, the neural mechanisms that give rise to gait variability are not completely understood. We thus lack
effective interventions to minimize gait variability in older adults. However, our team has demonstrated that in
older adults, those with elevated gait variability exhibit worse ability to sustain performance on a continuous
cognitive task over time (i.e., sustained attention). My work has also linked gait variability to the functional
connectivity between the two large-scale brain networks believed to underserve sustained attention—namely,
the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default network (DN)—in multiple cohorts of older adults. Based
upon these discoveries, we designed a novel multi-channel transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
intervention to simultaneously facilitate the excitability of the DAN and inhibit the excitability of the DN. Our
preliminary data suggests that a single exposure to this tDCS, as compared to sham, reduces gait variability
when tested just following stimulation. My overarching hypothesis is that this form of tDCS can modulate the
functional connectivity between the DAN and DN and thus reduce gait variability in older adults. In this project,
we will test this hypothesis by examining the acute after-effects of a single session of tDCS on resting-state
functional connectivity (Aim 1), as well as determining the effects of a multi-session tDCS intervention on gait
variability and related outcomes (Aim 2). We will recruit 30 older adults free of major disease that exhibit
higher-than-typical gait variability. Participants will first complete a baseline assessment and two fMRI visits.
The same participants will then be randomized to a tDCS intervention arm (ten, once-daily, 20-min sessions) or
a ShamàtDCS intervention arm (five, once-daily, 20-min sessions of sham in week one followed by five, once-
daily, 20-min sessions of tDCS in week 2). The primary outcome of gait variability will be assessed daily using
a validated smartphone app for the entire study period. We expect to demonstrate that tDCS can modulate
functional connectivity and reduce gait variability in older adults. The results from this project are expected to
inform the design of a larger, more definitive trial of tDCS designed to optimize brain connectivity as it relates
to gait variability in older adults. This research, combined with specific training in advanced neuroimaging and
neuromodulation, cognitive neuroscience in aging, and the conduct a clinical research in vulnerable older
adults, will greatly facilitate my efforts to transition into an independence clinician scientist."
10762431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that more than 200
million episodes of acute gastroenteritis occur annually, resulting in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and over
5000 deceases. Vaccines against enteric pathogens are not available due, in part, to limited knowledge of the
many virulence mechanisms that enteropathogens have evolved to colonize, multiply and escape host
defenses. We have recently discovered the ANR (AraC Negative Regulators) family, comprising a large
number of small regulatory proteins produced by diverse clinically important enteric pathogens including Vibrio
spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Citrobacter spp., enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic
EPEC, enterohaemorragic (EHEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). Members of the ANR family
modulate the expression of virulence factors such as fimbriae, toxins, type-3 and type-6 secretion systems,
and genes associated with metabolism, stress-response and fitness, by protein-protein interactions with
positive transcriptional regulators of the AraC/XylS family and negative regulators of the HNS family.
Furthermore, the absence of this regulatory system affects bacterial pathogenesis in a natural model of
infection. Our overall hypothesis is that the ANR family plays a critical role in the concerted regulation of fitness
and virulence in pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family by taking concomitant control of AraC and HNS
global regulators. Here, we propose to obtain mechanistic insights into ANR molecular interactions (AIM-1),
regulation (AIM 2) and pathogenesis (AIM-3) using EAEC, EPEC and C. rodentium as pathogen models,
human stem cell technology and a natural animal model of disease, coupled with genetic, biochemical and
molecular approaches such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy
(TLFM) and ChIP-seq. Our proposed studies will advance our knowledge of global gene regulatory
mechanisms that govern fitness and virulence in pathogenic bacteria, and will likely open new avenues for
therapeutic intervention."
10762434,"Abstract
Neonates are particularly susceptible to invasion by colonizing bacteria and thus mammalian mothers protect
their children via antibodies and in particular, Immunoglobulin A (IgA), secreted into maternal milk. Necrotizing
Enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of premature infants characterized by invasion of the neonatal intestine by the
microbiota. Studies have shown that the incidence of NEC is significantly reduced in infants fed with breast milk,
though the mechanism is unclear. Our preliminary studies show that maternal IgA (mIgA) is an important factor
in protection against NEC. Analysis of IgA-binding on fecal samples from premature infants indicated that breast
milk was the predominant source of IgA in the first month post-delivery and that a relative drop in the fraction of
bacteria bound by IgA is associated with the development of NEC. Sequencing of IgA-bound and unbound
bacteria indicated that NEC was associated with a unique increase in IgA negative Enterobacteriaceae. Further,
we confirmed that IgA is critical in preventing NEC in the murine model, where we demonstrate that pups reared
by mIgA deficient mothers are susceptible to disease, indicating that IgA in breast milk is necessary for
protection. Together these data indicate that mIgA binding is critical in preventing the development of NEC by
shaping the neonatal microbiota. In order to mediate effects on bacterial communities IgA acts on bacterial sub-
populations. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that IgA in maternal milk modifies intestinal bacteria directly,
preventing their invasion of the neonatal intestine and the induction of inflammatory immune responses. We will
test this hypothesis in three aims. In the first aim we will investigate the mechanisms of how individual sub-
populations of Enterobacteriaceae change to elude mIgA. Further we will investigate the mIgA repertoire of
different breast milk donors to test the hypothesis that variation in this repertoire is important in binding different
intestinal bacteria. In aim 2 we will investigate the mechanism of IgA binding on the neonatal microbiota at the
community level, via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and by transcriptional analysis of a model organism in
gnotobiotic mice. Our hope is to associate these data with analysis of the role of IgA on epithelial association of
intestinal bacteria and the downstream immune responses that are induced. In the third aim we will investigate
whether the production of mammary gland antibodies that protect against NEC are dependent upon maternal T
cells. These aims will lead to a better understanding of how mIgA shapes the nascent microbiome and the
neonatal immune response. In addition, our proposal may improve provide strategies to prevent NEC via the
targeted provision of breast milk containing protective antibodies to the most at-risk children."

The United States now performs more robotic surgery than all other countries combined. While the
overall volume of robotic surgery has tripled in the past decade, its use for the most common general
surgery operations (e.g. inguinal hernia repair or gallbladder removal) has increased more than 24-
fold over this same period. Despite this, evidence regarding the use and clinical outcomes of robotic
surgery for these operations is limited – putting patients at risk between enthusiasm for a new surgical
technology and insufficient evidence to justify large changes in clinical practice. Existing observational
studies lack appropriate controls and the small number of randomized trials focus on narrow clinical
domains (e.g. surgery for rectal cancer) with carefully selected patients and the most experienced
surgeons. This proposal uses a combination of Medicare and private payer claims data to
characterize the real-world adoption, outcomes, and health care expenditures of robotic surgery for
common general surgical operations. We focus on inguinal/ventral hernia repair, cholecystectomy,
and surgery for colon and rectal cancer – the clinical domains experiencing the largest growth in
robotic surgery. We leverage natural variation in the regional adoption of robotic surgery as an
instrumental variable to mitigate issues of selection bias that limit prior observational studies
estimating the outcomes of robotic surgery. We use this approach to explore the short-term
comparative safety (e.g. incidence of postoperative complications), spending for the surgical episode
of care, and long-term effectiveness (e.g. hernia recurrence) of robotic surgery relative to the more
established laparoscopic and open approaches for each operation. We assess for heterogeneity in
outcomes across surgeons with varying degrees of experience performing robotic surgeries. The
results from this study will have immediate relevance to patients and providers making treatment
decisions around the safest and most effective approach for surgery. It will also inform the work of
policymakers and professional societies who share a common interest in ensuring the safe diffusion of
new surgical technologies. Finally, these data will provide public and private payers – who are jointly
moving towards greater use of evidence-based coverage design – with data to improve the value of
expensive surgical interventions in the United States."

Couplet Care, LLC is developing the Couplet Care BassinetTM, a novel infant clinical bassinet designed to support
safe implementation of skin-to-skin contact and rooming-in on postnatal units. Until recently, the standard of
hospital care for healthy term newborns was to be observed and cared for by maternity staff in a nursery with
other infants. However, as detailed in the World Health Organization/UNICEF report Ten Steps for Successful
Breastfeeding, it is now recommended that mothers and infants “room-in” together 24 hours per day, with one
hour of separation allowable for procedures outside of the postnatal unit room. As a result, the practice of nursery
care is no longer recommended nor facilitated. However, most bassinets in U.S. hospitals are still designed for
use by ambulatory nursery staff, rather than by mobility-impaired new mothers. These relics of nursery care
restrict maternal access to their infants and introduce infants to increased risk of physical injury. Bassinet tubs
can tip under the weight of mothers’ arms and the height of the tub walls can compromise infant handling. Often,
new mothers are required to either substantially twist their bodies to access their infants or get up out of bed to
reach them, despite being in immediate postpartum period and needing to heal. Such actions can cause new
mothers to experience unnecessary frustration, pain, or even injury. This is especially critical to the one-third of
U.S. women who deliver by cesarean section, as their limited ability to move and postpartum pain hinder timely
and safe infant care, undermine breastfeeding, impede their own recovery, and contribute to risk of infant falls
and suffocation. The substantial difficulty maneuvering infants in and out of conventional bassinets, coupled with
the pain and fatigue felt by new mothers, increase the risk of 1) infant drops, and 2) falling asleep with infants in
unsafe arrangements. To address these gaps in safe care, Couplet Care has developed a novel bassinet that
allows mothers to position infants over their bed and handle the infants independently. This is the only bassinet
model that gives mothers 100% access to their infant, without requiring the assistance of a second
person for infant transfer or bassinet adjustment. To ensure usability and safety, the Couplet Care Bassinet
design incorporates (1) a lower tub wall with access points, making it easier for a mother to reach her infant, (2)
adjustability features that allow for bassinet positioning over the mother, and (3) a design that secures the tub
into the frame. Building on the learnings from prototype use in a clinical setting during Phase I, Couplet Care
proposes the following Phase II Specific Aims: 1) Design Couplet Care Bassinet that is manufacturable and
compliant with FDA regulations, 2) Evaluate the impact of the Couplet Care Bassinet on maternal-infant patient
outcomes in a powered RCT, 3) Evaluate the usability and adoptability of the device from clinician and user
perspectives. This effort will give rise to a commercially viable bassinet that promotes safe mother-infant
connection during rooming-in while reducing the risk of infant drops/falls and suffocation, maternal waking from
unmet infant needs, and demands on nurses for assistance with non-medical needs."
10867454,"PROJECT SUMMARY
National and global substance misuse challenges require sustainable pipelines of elite investigators with a
wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and talents. Despite initiatives to promote diversity, certain groups
remain grossly underrepresented in the field. Many URM and disadvantaged scholars face multidimensional
historical and social obstacles that limit their access to the early enrichment, rigorous training, effective
mentoring, nourishing environments and financial support necessary to become drug misuse scientists. There
is a publication and funding award disparity between traditional students versus URM, disadvantaged or first-
generation investigators. These disparities are due in part to training gaps that occur in undergraduate
matriculation and have domino effects throughout one’s career to adversely affect employment, tenure
qualifications, and other aspects of academic life. The scarcity of URM scholars in drug abuse research is
particularly problematic as minority and disadvantaged communities have historically suffered
disproportionately from substance misuse crises. It is essential that we arrest these trends by developing
optimal training programs for URM scholars. To that end, we propose a year-long comprehensive research
education program titled “Scientific Training in Addiction Research Techniques (START) for gifted future
investigators from historically underrepresented and underserved backgrounds.” START specifically prepares
investigators to access, analyze, and disseminate data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
(ABCD) study through both mentored research experiences and didactic skill-building courses. The ABCD
Study is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States and uses an
“open science” framework to make all data publicly available. Trainees will complete coursework to support
their professional development, and will complete an independent, mentored research project using ABCD
data. Start scholars will present and/or publish their scientific findings, and a comprehensive program
evaluation will monitor trainees, mentors, and the program as a whole. The overarching goal of START is to
create a diverse pipeline of substance misuse clinical researchers who are trained in the analysis and
dissemination of data from the ABCD study."

While the main function of memory CD8+ T cells is to recognize and kill intracellular pathogens and tumors,
they can also produce multiple effector cytokines and chemokines that contribute to protective immune
responses. The precise mechanism for development of memory CD8+ T cell protection in vaccinated hosts is
not well understood. We have been investigating this question over the past 15 years with the underlying goal
to develop novel therapeutic strategies that harness the power of memory CD8+ T cells to the benefit of the
host. Our past and most recent mechanistic studies have established that, upon recall infection of vaccinated
hosts, memory CD8+ T cells can rapidly sense both inflammatory signals and cognate antigen to produce
interferon gamma (IFNγ) and sets of early coordinated chemokines. We reported that both signals are required
to promote potent activation of inflammatory Ly6C+ monocytes microbicidal effector function and achieve
optimal protection of vaccinated hosts. Building on these results, we propose in this exploratory proposal to
design, develop and test a novel bispecific IFNγ-chemokine Fc-fusion “ligand-trap” biologics that target and
activates Ly6C+ monocytes microbicidal functions for protection against infectious diseases, mimicking the
mechanism by which memory CD8+ T cells mediate effective protection of vaccinated host during recall
infection. We believe that such reagent has the potential to be used as a rapid and broad therapeutic against
multiple acute infections."
10758231,"Functional peripheral and central vagal neural circuits of interoception inhibiting pain
Interoception is the sense of the physiological condition of the body, and is critical for maintaining homeostasis
and regulating cognitive and emotional processes. The neural processing of interoception can be regulated by
electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, which led to an FDA-approved therapy for seizure and depression.
Interestingly, vagal stimulation also modulates intractable chronic pain in patients. However, the road to
improving chronic pain management through the regulation of interoceptive inputs is blocked by our ignorance
of the neurobiological mechanisms whereby vagal activity modulates chronic pain, posing a significant hurdle.
To overcome this hurdle, we will focus on the neural mechanisms of vagal modulation in a mouse model of
inflammation in temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a surrogate model of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). TMD
is a prevalent form of chronic pain that often occurs as a comorbidity with other chronic pain conditions, such as
migraine and fibromyalgia. Since chronic pain involves a wide range of neural processes ranging from peripheral
nociception to affective and cognitive processing in the brain, it is possible that interoceptive inputs regulate pain
pathways through multiple peripheral and central mechanisms. Vagal stimulation was suggested to inhibit
transmission of pain signals at spinal cord through the regulation of descending pain modulatory pathways.
Considering the high comorbidity of chronic pain and affective disorders, such as anxiety or depression, vagal
inputs likely modulate pain through regulation of brain regions involved in emotional regulation. Furthermore,
pain is driven by nociceptive processing by pain-sensing nerves at peripheral tissues, but vagal regulation of
nociception in the periphery has not been reported. Here, our objective is to determine functional neural
mechanisms by which interoception inhibits pain. Our central hypothesis is that vagal interoceptive circuits
intersect with peripheral and central nociceptive pathways to inhibit pain from TMJ. We will test this hypothesis
in the following specific aims."
10758234,"This proposal describes genetic and biochemical analyses of host factors regulating the expression of the Moloney murine leukemia virus, the prototype of the simple mammalian retroviruses. We are especially focused on characterizing the mechanism of action of specific factors that we have identified that limit or restrict virus expression in embryonic cell types. We will characterize the mechanisms by which murine embryonic stem (ES) cells transcriptionally silence proviral DNAs and maintain the integrity of the germ line. We will study three parallel pathways – a rapid and highly efficient mechanism targeting a specific DNA element of the Moloney provirus, the tRNApro Primer Binding Site (PBS); a less potent one acting at a conserved site, the negative control region (NCR) present on the proviral DNA of many retroviruses;; and a newly-­identified one also acting broadly on many retroviruses. We will characterize the DNA-­binding host proteins that mediate the silencing (ZFP809, YY1, and NP220) and determine how these silencing mechanisms are regulated so as to be specifically active in ES cells. The study will involve examination of ubiquitin ligases, SUMO transferases, and protein-­protein interactions needed to form the large complex that binds to the viral DNA and induces silencing by making repressive histone modifications. We will also examine the mechanism by which one of these factors uniquely activates, rather than silences, one member of the retrovirus family (HTLV-1). Because the expression of retroviral DNAs is so closely correlated with expression of host genes during embryonic development, these experiments will provide important new information about the properties that define “stemness” – the pluripotent state of ES cells. These aspects of control of retroviruses by host factors will provide new targets for antiviral therapy. Most importantly, these experiments will significantly extend our understanding of fundamental aspects of retrovirus replication, and of new cell biological processes that impact on these important viruses."
10758236,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Since the first serologic tests were introduced at the peak of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, continuous improvements
in diagnostic technology have enabled the earlier detection and routine monitoring of HIV positive individuals. However,
there are two areas where current HIV diagnostics fall short of ideal, and which we will attempt to directly address in this
proposal; the first is the need for a simple diagnostic tool that allows individuals to self‐test for acute phase HIV infections.
The second challenge is the provision of a diagnostic tool that will allow patients previously diagnosed as HIV positive to
monitor their viral load following ART interruption or check for loss of viral control due to the emergence of drug‐
resistance. Given these diagnostics are to be used in a patients own home (or other non‐clinical, setting), they need to be
cheap, robust, and suitable for use without prior training or specialist equipment. Further, they should use a biological
sample that can be obtained in a minimally invasive manner (e.g. a finger‐stick blood drop) to encourage frequent retesting
in target populations.
 To address the above problems, we will integrate two existing technologies to generate a sensitive home‐test
diagnostic for HIV. The first technology is a structurally novel binding domain, so called VNARs, that we isolate from
immunized sharks. Despite their diminutive size (12kDa), the VNAR domains raised thus far have binding affinities equal
to classical antibodies but are intrinsically much more chemo‐ and thermostable. VNARs interact with antigen in unique
ways and can be raised against epitopes that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies; we will exploit this fact to target
the HIV proteins p24 and Env, allowing us to capture and accurately quantify free proteins or whole virus in unmanipulated
blood. We will integrate these VNARs with our second technology, the programmable Bio‐Nano‐Chip (p‐BNC), a microchip‐
based detection system which utilizes porous agarose microbeads as 3D diagnostic surfaces. Immunometric assays can be
performed by loading the beads with biomolecules such as antibodies, or in this case VNARs, allowing the capture and
quantitation of desired target(s) in biological samples. To enable use of this technology in a non‐clinical setting, we will
develop credit card‐sized diagnostic cartridges that have a microbead‐based sensor array at their core, and microfluidic
system for the delivery of sample, wash buffer, and detection reagent. This will be deployed and read by a battery‐
powered handheld reader system that will be developed and fabricated during our project. This system will use an imaging
system derived from smartphones and enable the safe and secure uploading of data to a cloud‐based repository. Together
these technologies will allow us to deliver an inexpensive, robust, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic test that can be used
by an individual to assess their HIV status or closely monitor their viral load, without a clinic visit."
10932297,"1 Approximately 6.5 million Americans aged 65 and older live with dementia, supported by more than 11 million
 2 unpaid family caregivers. These numbers are projected to rise exponentially in the coming decades fueling the
 3 need to develop scalable ways to support dementia caregivers. The need to empower dementia caregivers to
 4 continue providing care while maintaining their own health and well-being is recognized in public health
 5 literature and in Strategy 3.B of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. While effective caregiver
 6 interventions exist, significant implementation barriers also exist. Many interventions have not been translated
 7 for widespread use. Most require delivery by time-strapped healthcare professionals, which is problematic
 8 given eldercare workforce shortages and medical delegation trends. The upshot is family caregivers are
 9 typically left unsupported to determine ways to manage complex care while maintaining their own well-being.
10 One way to improve the capacity of dementia caregivers to manage caregiving responsibilities and bolster their
11 well-being is by pinpointing where they have control and where to focus efforts to attain their wishes or goals. A
12 brief, easy to learn 4-step intervention called Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan (WOOP) does just that. WOOP is
13 a strategy that helps individuals set challenging but attainable goals and focus on internal obstacles over which
14 they have control. This helps them persist in goal-directed behavior, improving the likelihood they will attain the
15 wish or goal. WOOP, known scientifically as Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII), has
16 been rigorously developed over 20 years, translated into multiple languages, and used effectively in more than
17 100 countries worldwide across multiple domains such as career achievement, health, and interpersonal
18 relations. Recent preliminary work demonstrated WOOP to be effective for dementia caregivers. In a
19 randomized controlled trial, dementia caregivers taught to use WOOP via in-person one-on-one sessions and
20 phone coaching experienced reduced stress, reduced depressive symptoms, and increased positive emotions
21 and quality of life. What remains unknown is whether tailoring WOOP for dementia caregivers and delivering it
22 to groups via novel technology is feasible and effective. In this effort, Borrow My Glasses, a gerontology
23 education company and woman owned small business teams with research institute Yale University and
24 consultants including the developer of WOOP, healthcare professionals, and others with lived experience as
25 dementia caregivers. SPECIFIC AIMS: This STTR Phase I proposal uses human centered design to AIM 1:
26 translate WOOP into a novel technology prototype tailored to the needs of dementia caregivers and test it for
27 usability. AIM 2: conduct iterative proof-of-concept testing to evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability,
28 feasibility, and perceived benefit of disseminating WOOP to groups of dementia caregivers via web-based e-
29 learning technology. Overall feasibility in Phase 1 will inform a randomized controlled trial in Phase 2 to further
30 tailor the design, strategy, and readiness to scale WOOP for Dementia Caregivers commercially."
10763428,"In humans, social attachment with partners, relatives, or friends act as a protective buffer against
many negative consequences of life stress, whereas lack of social attachments can lead to
serious pathologies including dysphoria, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular
problems, and immune system deficits. In the social prairie voles, acute and chronic social
isolation as well as partner separation induce anxiety and depression-like behaviors, enhance
stress response, and alter activities of several neurochemical systems, including the oxytocinergic
system. Data from our group and others have shown that oxytocin (OT) is involved not only in the
formation of pair bonds in this specie, but also in the response to social isolation/ partner
separation as well as social buffering of stress responses. In this proposal, we will verify the
overall hypothesis that breaking bonds in voles alter the OT circuitry projecting from the
hypothalamic PVN to the nucleus accumbens (which represents 90% of OT projections to nucleus
accumbens) and leads to negative consequences on social behaviors in male and female prairie
voles."
10757626,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in U.S. women at all ages, and
large knowledge gaps exist in CVD predictive and preventive strategies for women. The nuMoM2b Heart
Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) has followed a demographically diverse cohort of 4,475 women enrolled and
richly phenotyped during their first pregnancy, with data and biospecimens prospectively collected for up to 7
years thereafter. The overarching scientific goal of the nuMoM2b-HHS is to define the relationship between
adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and CVD to optimize CVD prediction, prevention, and treatment
strategies for women. Continued follow-up of this cohort, building on a foundation of existing high-quality
data, biospecimens, and administrative structures with a robust framework for ancillary study development
and implementation, provides a unique opportunity to address knowledge gaps regarding the early
mechanisms and trajectory of CVD in women. We propose to continue nuMoM2b-HHS follow-up through
semiannual contacts and an in-person visit to assess CVD risk factors during grant years 3-5 (Aim 1).
Accumulated longitudinal data and biospecimens will serve as a broadly accessible platform for ancillary
studies to identify early mechanisms of CVD and to address additional NIH priority domains including early
manifestations of cerebrovascular and renal disease in reproductive-age women. Ancillary studies (Aim 2)
will expand data collection during the follow-up contacts and in-person visit, and add to the planned contact
schedule, to permit the effective targeting of knowledge gaps required to optimize predictive and preventive
strategies. The Specific Aims reflect a multifaceted approach to the study of the incidence and mechanisms
of CVD development in women of reproductive age, focusing on the incidence of CVD risk factors in women
with and without APOs (Aim 3); the associations between atherogenic phenotypes and sleep-disordered
breathing during and after pregnancy and estimated CVD risk 6-15 years later (Aims 4 and 5, respectively);
and identification of modifiable factors that influence or moderate these associations (Aim 6).
This application has several strengths that reflect the potential for long-term success of the cohort: (1) The
nuMoM2b-HHS will be led by three deeply experienced PIs with complementary domains of expertise in
cardiology, maternal-fetal medicine, and biostatistics. (2) The network has robust infrastructure in place to
maintain long-term participant engagement and support rigorous data collection. (3) The cohort's high-quality
data and biospecimens have been collected under regulatory frameworks that support resource sharing and
use in future research. (4) The network has established processes for successfully proposing, reviewing, and
implementing ancillary studies. This foundation of strong leadership, robust administrative and operational
infrastructure, and actualized long-term vision will provide an ideal environment for the nuMoM2b-HHS to
continue to address critical knowledge gaps concerning CVD development in women of reproductive age."
10892287,"Abstract
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) disproportionally affects people in low- and middle-income countries and is
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Stroke is a common complication in TBM and can lead to severe
irreversible neurological disability. Studies on TBM-associated stroke pathology, however, have focused
primarily on HIV-uninfected individuals. The overall objective of this proposal is to use transcranial doppler and
brain imaging to understand changes in cerebral blood vessels and cerebral blood flow in order to determine
changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness, characterize patterns of stroke, and describe long-term
neurocognitive outcomes in HIV-associated TBM. The central hypothesis is that in HIV-infected individuals,
TBM causes extensive cerebral vascular narrowing and impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness, decreased
cerebral blood flow, and ultimately stroke. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
1) describe changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness in HIV-associated TBM; 2) characterize the patterns of
stroke in HIV-associated TBM and determine whether it is associated with vasculopathy and/or impairments in
cerebrovascular responsiveness; and 3) determine if impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness predicts long-
term neurological outcome in HIV-associated TBM. Under Aim 1, transcranial doppler will be used to take
repeated measurements of the middle cerebral artery flow velocity and pulsatility index. A subset of study
subjects will also have dynamic measurements made in response to stimuli (inhaled CO2, changes in blood
pressure, and motor tasks). We will determine whether cerebrovascular responsiveness is impaired in HIV-
associated TBM by comparing measurements to those of control patients with no neurological infection. Under
Aim 2, all study subjects will have a brain MRI performed within the first 2-weeks of TBM treatment to identify
the presence of a cerebral artery stroke and the associated cerebral artery territory. We will compare TCD
readings between participants with or without stroke. Under Aim 3, we will examine how TCD measurements at
study enrolment relate to the results of neurocognitive testing at month 2 and functional assessment at month
6. Ultimately, the long-term goal of the proposal is to describe how impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness in
HIV-associated TBM contributes to the development of strokes and resulting neurocognitive impairment and
disability. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it incorporates the use of
transcranial doppler at the bedside, to be used in real time, in the care of subjects with TBM. The proposed
research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for the development of
future clinical trials testing targeted interventions to improve cerebrovascular responsiveness and prevent the
development of strokes in HIV-associated TBM. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of preventing the
development of irreversible neurological injury and improving both short and long-term outcomes."
10883654,"Despite successes in diagnosing and initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people with HIV (PWH) in Peru, a
LMIC with an HIV epidemic concentrated in key at-risk populations, the implementation gap is highest for
retention in care (RIC), resulting in low levels of viral suppression (43%) and increasing HIV incidence. HIV care
in Peru is currently concentrated in large secondary health centers (SHCs). Based on WHO recommendations
to decentralize healthcare, an evidence-based practice that increases RIC, the Peruvian Ministry of Health
recommended in 2019 to decentralize HIV services to primary health centers (PHCs). We propose to work in the
4 largest regions in urban Lima that manages 37% of all PWH in care. Currently, <15% of PWH in Lima receive
care in PHCs, supporting the need for more effective implementation of decentralized services. Using the RE-
AIM implementation framework, we propose to accelerate decentralization by combining NIATx, an evidence-
informed implementation strategy with a bundle of implementation tools to scale up evidence-based practices,
with Project ECHO, an evidence-informed tele-educational strategy to increase clinical skills in primary care
providers to competently provide specialty (i.e., HIV) services. We will first use the Delphi method to establish
guidelines to safely decentralize PWH using a hub (SHC) and spoke (PHC) model and to establish the minimal
number of quality health indicators that are needed to safely keep patients in PHCs. These guidelines can be
used to create clinical checklists that can be used to support guideline concordance in clinical practice. We will
then conduct a rapid, multi-level (patients, clinicians, healthcare system) assessment of barriers and facilitators
to decentralizing HIV care, which will be assessed just before each of the four hub and spoke regions will be
randomized to 24 months of implementation using NIATx and ECHO in a stepped wedge design. The primary
effectiveness outcome will be proportionate change of PWH receiving HIV care in PHCs. Secondary outcomes
include RIC and VS with exploratory analyses for mortality. The primary implementation outcomes are
confidence in managing PWH at PHCs. Collaboration, workplace climate and adoption of HIV care at new PHC
sites will be measured within each hub and spoke. Adoption of HIV care at new PHCs in each region will be
assessed. Importance is high due to the MoH’s goal to decentralize HIV care in an urban, low/middle income
setting where HIV is concentrated in key populations with low levels of RIC and VS levels. Innovation is high due
to combining NIATx and ECHO in an urban South American context and using them beyond addiction treatment.
Feasibility is high due to the longstanding relationships between team members alongside the strong
commitment by the Ministry of Health. The team brings expertise in HIV care (Sanchez, Altice), Public Health
(Konda, Altice), implementation science (Altice, Madden, Konda) and service integration (Altice, Madden). Public
Health benefit is high not only in terms of systems-, clinician- and patient-level benefits through implementing
decentralized care in Peru, but also serves as a template for other urban, low/middle income settings."
10771300,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Placental pathologies stem from poor early placental development characterized by shallow invasion of
trophoblasts, and are also associated with aberrant expression of miRNAs belonging to the primate-specific
chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC). C19MC miRNAs are thought to have roles in trophoblast invasion and
migration, however, their role(s) in primate embryonic and early placental development is not well-defined. I
hypothesize that C19MC miRNAs will have primate-specific roles in trophectoderm lineage specification
and early development of the primate placenta. The overall objective of my proposal is to determine the role
of these miRNAs in primate trophoblast lineage specification and placental development in a rhesus macaque
model, and reveal gene networks regulated by miRNAs in primate placentation. Towards this objective, I propose
three Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1 (K99-phase). To define the expression of miRNAs in the primate embryo and
trophoblast stem cells (TSC). This aim will establish the miRNA signature during embryo development
through specification of the trophectoderm lineage and determine whether these miRNAs are
expressed in a stage- or cell-type-specific manner.
Specific Aim 2 (K99-phase). To determine the functional role(s) of C19MC members in TSC and
differentiated trophoblast function. This experiment will directly overexpress C19MC miRNA members
in TSC to identify genes and pathways regulated by these miRNAs, assessing their functional roles.
Specific Aim 3 (R00-phase). To use genome editing strategies to globally perturb the C19MC and
evaluate the impact of aberrant C19MC miRNA expression on embryo development and primate
placentation. This Aim will 1) repress and overexpress C19MC cluster expression utilizing genome
editing tools in TSC, 2) apply C19MC genome editing to embryos to evaluate the role of cluster
expression on primate preimplantation embryo development, and 3) determine the impact of embryonic
genome editing on trophectoderm function and differentiation in an in vitro implantation culture model.
I have recently developed macaque TSCs with methods described by Okae et al. (2018), and have experience
with rhesus IVF to derive embryos for genome editing and in vitro implantation experiments. TSC and embryo
resources will be used to define miRNA and mRNA expression during embryo development and trophoblast
lineage specification and identify miRNA-regulated gene networks in early placentation. Overall, the proposed
research will establish a basic understanding of miRNA expression and miRNA target gene regulation in the
embryo to placenta transition. Ultimately, we envision that the nonhuman primate model will allow us to extend
these approaches to transfer of edited embryos to recipient dams, and to develop in vivo strategies to directly
target the placenta for modification of miRNA expression for experimental and therapeutic purposes."

of diverse racial, ethnic, gender, disciplinary, and institutional backgrounds in a novel scheme of team science
training and peer mentoring to build communication and leadership skills across the translational spectrum. The
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences defines the translational spectrum as representing each
stage of research along the path from the biological basis of health and disease to interventions that improve the
health of individuals and the public. It is essential to train researchers with skills that match the ever-increasing
complexity of the research enterprise with communication skills across the translational spectrum. To address
this complexity, we have the need and opportunity to develop translational scientists who are able to go beyond
their disciplinary knowledge and have an appreciation for and an understanding of the translational spectrum

10765653,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Alcoholic liver disease is a major health and financial concern worldwide. Liver fibrosis and its advanced form,
cirrhosis, can occur in virtually all types of chronic liver disease (CLD) including alcohol-induced liver injury.
According to the American Liver Foundation, 5.5 million Americans are currently afflicted with CLD or cirrhosis,
and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports cirrhosis as the 12th leading cause of death due to disease
in America. Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) are the source of an alternative regenerative mechanism when
hepatocyte proliferation is inhibited due to severe liver damage. HPC are closely associated with activated
myofibroblast cells (MF) and correlate with severity of liver fibrosis in many CLD. No FDA approved treatment
is currently available for any fibrotic disorder. There is an urgent need for the development of anti-fibrotic drugs
to control progression of fibrosis while in reversible stages.
 Connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) is a profibrotic mediator and modulates cell-cell and cell-matrix
signaling through binding to a variety of growth factors, matrix protein, and cell surface proteins including
integrins. It is a target gene of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (Yap) and acts as an
enhancer of transforming growth factor (Tgf)-β, promoting liver fibrosis and HPC activation in chronic liver
disease. Our studies demonstrated fine-tuned regulation of Ctgf via hepatocyte nuclear factor (Hnf)4α
antagonism of Yap and TGF-β1 signaling in regenerating hepatocytes whereas Ctgf deficiency reduces
hepatic inflammation, hepatocyte proliferation and collagen synthesis. Adamts7 (a disintegrin and
metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I repeat 7) was identified as a novel enzyme for Ctgf turnover
during liver injury. The Ctgf binding protein-extracellular matrix protein (ECM)1- was identified to inhibit Tgf-β
activation and exhibited anti-fibrotic potential. The multifaceted regulations of Ctgf during fibrosis offers
important translational opportunities for diagnosis and follow-up of hepatic fibrogenesis as well as intriguing
targets for therapeutic interventions. Utilizing a noninvasive imaging technique we recently developed, in Aim
1, the function of Adamts7 in regulating fibrotic responses during alcohol-induced liver injury will be examined.
In Aim 2, the anti-fibrotic effects of ECM1 on alcoholic liver injury and HPC activation will be assessed.
 This study will provide new mechanistic insights during alcoholic liver disease. The knowledge we
obtain will help identify molecular targets to enhance liver regeneration and reduce liver fibrosis."

More than 50% of youth will experience at least one form of significant adversity in early life. Such 
adversities pose significant risk not only for the development of psychopathology over the life course, but also 
for attempted suicide, a leading cause of death in people ages 10-24 years. We have recruited and assessed 
220 9- to 13-year-old boys and girls across four timepoints, each two years apart, to examine the effects of 
exposure to ELS on trajectories of stress reactivity and reward sensitivity, and, in turn, their impact on the 
onset of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors across adolescence. In this cohort we have conducted 
repeated measurements of symptoms and diagnoses of psychopathology, neural, endocrine, cognitive, 
immunological, and behavioral assessments of stress reactivity and reward sensitivity, and early exposure to 
adversity, including the type, severity, and timing of stressful events. We have published a series of papers 
from this project elucidating the effects of ELS on psychobiological functioning, trajectories of brain 
development, and biological aging, and the consequences of these alterations for clinical functioning. In this 
MERIT renewal application, we propose to build on and extend our work in three important ways. First, we will 
conduct an additional assessment of our participants at age 20 in order to examine the effects of ELS on 
trajectories of neurodevelopment and clinical outcomes from childhood to young adulthood, as well as the 
persistence of COVID-19 pandemic-related difficulties in mental health, stress, and brain metrics. We will also 
extend our examination of how environmental pollutants and conditions affect relations among these variables. 
Second, we will extend and replicate our findings in a younger, non-Western sample by analyzing data from 
the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) project, an ongoing prospective study in 
which many of the same, or comparable, measures that we administered in our project have also been 
collected regularly from approximately 1,500 parents and children since the prenatal period. Extending and 
replicating our findings with the GUSTO dataset, which includes younger, non-Western children from 
Southeast Asian families in Singapore, will complement findings from other large cohorts, like ABCD and 
NCANDA, that have assessed only Western participants. Finally, will leverage our own and GUSTO data to 
examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown on children’s and adolescents’ psychobiological 
functioning. In both datasets we have a unique opportunity to compare comprehensive psychobiological data 
collected from the same youth before and after the pandemic shutdowns in order not only to examine how the 
pandemic has altered young people’s psychobiological functioning and development, but importantly, to also 
identify risk and resilience factors across cultural contexts. Further, the new proposed adult assessment in our 
ELS project will allow us to examine the persistence of COVID-related difficulties by re-assessing participants 
whom we studied soon after pandemic quarantine restrictions ended."
10817803,"Motivational impairments are a key feature of both psychotic and mood disorders. Decreases in motivation
impair work and social function transdiagnostically, reduce quality of life, and increase public health demands.
Current treatments are not sufficiently effective at reducing impairments in motivation, in part due to the need
to better understand the mechanisms that give rise to these symptoms. The work in the prior round of funding
provided strong evidence that abnormal effort-cost decision-making (ECDM; Effort valuation/Willingness to
work in the RDoC Positive Valence System) may be a key contributor to motivational deficits in psychotic
pathology (i.e., individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder), but not among
individuals with mood pathology (i.e., Major Depression). ECDM refers to calculations that individuals perform
to estimate the amount of physical or cognitive ""work"" required to obtain a reward. Individuals with
schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar disorder are less motivated than healthy individuals to exert effort to
obtain rewards on experimental tasks of ECDM, with associated deficits in dorsal-fontal parietal control
systems, and these deficits are related to symptoms of amotivation and function in everyday life. Individuals
with depression did not show such deficits on tasks of either physical or cognitive effort, despite showing
clear evidence of anhedonia in everyday life. These data strongly support our hypotheses that the
mechanisms that contribute to motivational impairments in psychosis differ from those in depression. Here
we expand this work. In Aim 1 we will utilize novel behavioral and imaging paradigms derived from the
affective science literature to assess social and non-social motivation (Consultant Sommerville, co-I Braver)
to test the hypothesis that individuals with psychosis will show even greater impairment in effort allocation
for social than monetary rewards, while individuals with depression will show equal impairments in both. In
Aim 2, we will integrate state-of-the art neuroimaging methods (neuromelanin) to indirectly measure
dopamine function (consultant Horga) to test the hypothesis that dopamine disruption will be more strongly
related to indices of motivational impairments in depression versus psychosis. In Aim 3, we will incorporate
innovative mobile technologies to longitudinally assess social and non-social motivated behavior and
cognition (Consultant Gershon) in everyday life, testing the hypotheses that the magnitude of motivational
impairments in psychosis will covary over time with cognitive impairments among individuals with psychosis,
but not among individuals with depression."
10783688,"Inflammatory and infectious causes of encephalitis affect 20,000 people a year in the US. More than 50%
of patients have inflammatory disorders requiring prolonged treatment with expensive and dangerous biological
or immunosuppressive agents. The most common identifiable causes of these syndromes are paraneoplastic,
post-infectious or associated with other underlying autoimmune diseases; however, the majority of patients are
still classified as idiopathic. In the last 1-2 decades many of these syndromes have been shown to be associated
with anti-neural autoantibodies that either cause the pathophysiology or serve as critical biomarkers. The most
widely cited examples of these are anti-Hu antibodies, which are highly correlated with an underlying cancer,
and anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, which cause psychosis, seizures and memory disturbances.
 Over the past 5 years, a unique interdisciplinary team of neurologists and basic scientists at UCSF was
formed to develop and deploy an integrated approach to rapidly identify anti-neural antibodies associated with
encephalitis, with the explicit intent to discover and validate clinically actionable biomarkers in addition to
uncovering the fundamental mechanisms of disease pathogenesis underlying these syndromes. The
centerpiece of these efforts is a patient cohort being collected at UCSF called the NID (Neuroinflammatory
Disease) cohort, consisting of patients with suspected infectious or inflammatory encephalitis. This cohort is
now >1,200 patients referred by clinicians at UCSF and from other centers around the world. Already, this
cohort has yielded a new paraneoplastic autoimmune syndrome with important implications for men with
seminoma. More importantly, we have reason to believe this to be just the tip of the iceberg. Our preliminary
data indicates that at least 20% of these patients have associated high titer antibodies in their CSF reactive to
neural antigens in mouse brain. Here, we propose to pursue the hypothesis that a plurality of
undiscovered autoimmune targets underlie a significant fraction of idiopathic encephalitis cases. Using
our unique clinical and molecular approach and our world class patient collection, we will investigate this
hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1: To stratify and characterize the UCSF 1,200 patient NID cohort for the presence of anti-neural antibodies in CSF. Aim 2: High-throughput phage display screen to identify and validate auto antigens. Aim 3: Produce recombinant human antibodies from patients with autoantibody syndromes and develop animal models to test autoantibody pathogenicity."
10783697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with
clinical presentations ranging from progressive paralysis to cognitive impairment. FTD is the second most
common cause of dementia in people under the age of 65 and accounts for 25% of cases of dementia in
people over 65 years of age. Approximately 15% of ALS-FTD patients initially presenting with motor symptoms
also receive a diagnosis of dementia, but a majority of ALS-FTD patients demonstrate some level of cognitive
impairment over the course of disease. Identifying molecular pathways that contribute to the development of
cognitive deficits in ALS-FTD has thus far been limited by the quality of clinical information and postmortem
tissue preservation as well as available technologies. Our collaborators at the University of Edinburgh have
assembled a cohort of non-demented ALS-FTD patients with detailed cognitive profiling and high quality
postmortem tissue preservation for molecular studies. Novel highly multiplexed protein imaging and spatially
resolved transcriptomics methods have made it possible to quantify cell type composition and gene expression
in situ in postmortem tissue sections. These experimental advances have the potential to elucidate molecular
mechanisms that are associated with cognitive dysfunction in ALS-FTD.
 This proposal seeks to understand how TDP-43 pathology and local changes in the tissue
microenvironment contribute to cognitive impairment in patients with ALS-FTD. By integrating multiplexed
imaging and spatial transcriptomics data, I will quantify cell type proportions (Aim 1) and perturbations in gene
expression (Aim 2) proximal to TDP-43 pathology in postmortem tissues from this cohort of ALS-FTD patients
with detailed clinical and neuropathological characterization. By comparing these features in patients with and
without cognitive dysfunction, I will identify molecular pathways that may contribute to or protect against
cognitive impairment in ALS-FTD. This multimodal approach can be applied to study clinicopathologic
correlates of other proteinopathies.
 My fellowship proposal also outlines a rigorous training plan focused on developing the intellectual and
professional skills required for a successful career as a physician scientist: 1) designing rigorous, well-
controlled and well-powered studies, 2) effective science communication through oral presentations,
manuscript writing and grant writing, 3) cutting-edge experimental and computational genomics methods, 4)
mentorship of trainees and collaboration with scientists from other disciplines, and 5) placing research in a
clinical context. As a predoctoral trainee, I will benefit from the mentorship of Dr. Hemali Phatnani and Dr. Tom
Maniatis, the expertise of our neuropathology, engineering, and computational collaborators, and the
collaborative and supportive training environments at the New York Genome Center and the Columbia
University Irving Medical Center."
10783708,"Abstract
Lymphoid B-ALL and TCLL leukemia consists of leukemic blast cells (LBCs) arrested at early stages of
differentiation which exhibit high proliferative potential and capability for self-renewal. The idea to induce
reprogramming of leukemic and other cancer cells, leading to cell maturation and senescence, gained high
popularity, but its clinical applications are rarely successful and are mainly limited to the therapy of the APL
leukemia with ATRA and arsenic trioxide. This strategy may have been unsuccessful due to a gap in the
knowledge of the mechanisms through which transcriptional reprogramming occurs. Our published data
suggest that normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) undergo transient de-condensation of chromatin to
allow lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) to bind to their gene targets and to activate new transcriptional
programs, leading to cell differentiation. This transient de-condensation occurs through very low accumulation
of H3K27me3, on DNA just after DNA replication. H3K27me3 is a mark of the most condensed arrays of
nucleosomes in the genome and is found at regulatory regions of all repressed genes. Our results suggest that
tested cultured and primary lymphoid B-ALL and TCLL cells have lost this inherent ability to ‘open’ nascent
chromatin, thus creating a barrier for their transcriptional reprogramming. In this proposal, we will test a new
reprogramming strategy, which overcomes these barriers of reprogramming-based therapies and may lead to
elimination of leukemic cells. The key feature of this new strategy is the first step, which includes
pharmacological inhibition of the H3K27me3 histone methyltransferases (HMTs) EZH1/EZH2, thus creating de-
condensed structure of nascent chromatin at regulatory regions of all genes. At the second step, we will use
small molecules to activate endogenous inducible TFs, which can then readily bind to their target genes due to
the de-condensed structure of nascent chromatin. Tumor cells, including leukemic cells, are commonly known
to accumulate mutations in inducible TFs and receptors; thus, screens of small molecule inducers for a variety
of TFs/receptors will be performed to determine the best possible inducer for distinct subtypes of B-ALL.
Preliminary results suggest that induction by small molecule inducers leads to transcriptional reprogramming of
cell lines and primary B-ALL and TCLL cells, changes in their immunophenotype and apoptosis. Moreover, this
strategy strongly suppresses lymphoid leukemia burden in mice. The goal of this project is to develop a widely
applicable treatment strategy for transcriptional reprogramming and loss of cell viability for many types of
lymphoid leukemic cells. To this end, we propose to: 1. Extend and generalize the lymphoid leukemic cells
reprogramming approach; 2. Examine the mechanisms and biological outcomes of reprogramming of lymphoid
leukemic cells; 3. Examine the effects of our treatment strategy in vivo."
10783710,"Through our previous work funded by the American Parkinson Disease Association and NINDS, we have
discovered a new Parkinson’s disease (PD) genetic locus on the short arm of chromosome 20, and identified a
new PD gene, TMEM230. TMEM230 encodes a transmembrane protein of secretory and recycling vesicles,
including synaptic vesicles in neurons. TMEM230 is the first transmembrane protein of synaptic vesicles
identified in PD to date. Our findings, therefore, directly point to the dysfunction of synaptic vesicles in the
pathogenesis of PD. The precise physiological functions of TMEM230, and pathogenic mechanism of the
TMEM230-mediated PD remain unclear. Based on the molecular features of TMEM230, and its relationship
with synaptic vesicle and endosomal markers tested in our study, we hypothesize that TMEM230 is a
trafficking protein of synaptic vesicles, and it may function in synaptic vesicle biogenesis, exocytosis,
endocytosis and recycling, and synaptic transmission in neurons. But it remains to be determine where in the
subcellular compartments and what functions that TMEM230 plays. In the previous funding cycle, we identified
TMEM230 as an endocytic cargo protein that binds to the medium subunit (AP2M1) of adaptor protein 2
complex (AP2) to promote AP2-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis; whereas, PD-linked mutations affect
this process and impair synaptic vesicle recycling, more specifically, by affecting budding from presynaptic
membrane to form new AP2/clathrin-coated recycling vesicles. In this application, we propose three specific
aims to determine the physiological function of TMEM230, especially the functional motifs for TMEM230 to
bind to AP2M1, and the pathogenic mechanism underlying TMEM230-linked PD. We propose to develop a
total of six TMEM230 mouse models in specific aim 1, to perform phenotypical, pathological and biochemical
characterization in specific aim 2, and to perform neurophysiological characterization of nigrostriatal pathway in
these mouse models in specific aim 3.
SV recycling deficits have emerged as a convergent pathogenic pathway underlying PD pathogenesis. There
is evidence that LRRK2, auxilin and synaptojanin 1 affect clathrin uncoating; and VPS35 may impair retromer-
TGN trafficking. TMEM230 appears to affect a distinct step in SV recycling i.e., budding from the presynaptic
membrane to form new AP2/clathrin-coated recycling SVs. A number of important issues remains to be
addressed. Based on our resources and expertise, we propose to address some of these issues using relevant
mouse models in this application. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide essential
information to understand the physiological function of TMEM230 and the pathogenic mechanism underlying
TMEM230-linked PD. Moreover, since TMEM230-linked PD shows clinical and pathological features
compatible with those in classical PD, the outcomes from this study may also have important implications in
understanding the pathogenic mechanisms in other forms of PD, including sporadic PD."

Understanding and Manipulating the Degradation of the C9orf72 Repeat Expansion RNA
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are progressive, fatal
neurodegenerative diseases. The most common cause of hereditary ALS and FTD is an expansion of the G4C2
sequence in an intron of the C9orf72 gene (c9ALS/FTD). A hallmark pathologic feature of c9ALS/FTD is the
presence of repeat expansion RNA foci in neuronal nuclei, which is unusual because introns are usually
degraded too rapidly to be easily detected. The accumulating G4C2 repeat expansion RNA is thought to
contribute to c9ALS/FTD disease development in two ways: it can sequester RNA-binding proteins and disrupt
their function, and it can be exported into the cytoplasm for translation into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins.
The persistence of the repeat expansion RNA suggests that it forms a stable RNA structure that resists the
normal intron degradation machinery. However, eukaryotic cells contain specific mechanisms for the
degradation of RNAs with strong secondary structures. Such RNAs are post-transcriptionally modified with 3'
oligo-uridine or oligo-adenosine tails that then recruit processive 3' to 5' exonucleases to degrade the RNA. I
hypothesize that the C9orf72 repeat RNA is a poor substrate for normal intronic degradation pathways and that
3’ end tailing determines its rate of decay. To test this, the goal of this proposal is two-fold: I will determine the
composition of the repeat expansion RNA that accumulates into nuclear foci to learn where intronic
degradation is stalling (Aim 1), and I will examine the changes to the sequence and levels of the
G4C2 repeat expansion RNA in response to perturbations to 3’ end tailing, tail removal, and RNA degradation
(Aim 2). Taken together, these studies present an exciting opportunity to discover the mechanisms that
promote degradation of the toxic repeat expansion RNA and, potentially, the ability to accelerate its decay to
reduce toxicity. If successful, the knowledge gained from this work could guide future therapeutic design for
c9ALS/FTD."
10929982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral palsy (CP) results from a perinatal brain injury and is one of the most prevalent and costly
developmental disabilities in the United States. As persons with CP transition from adolescence into adulthood
they continue to be faced with prominent mobility challenges. Despite the increased recognition of the mobility
deteriorations, NIH funding related to transition aged persons with CP is remarkably low. Thus, research focused
on enhancing the mobility of persons with CP during this critical transition period is sorely needed to help narrow
the gap and eliminate this disparity.
Over the last decade, there has been considerable interest in utilizing robotic exoskeletons in a therapeutic
setting for improved mobility. This therapeutic approach is interesting because the exoskeleton can be used
while the patient practices real-world tasks (i.e., stair and obstacle negotiation). However, the current therapeutic
approaches used with these robotic exoskeletons are primarily focused on compensation (i.e., body weight
support, passive leg facilitation), which might dampen motor learning since it can disengage the nervous system.
This proposal opposes this treatment strategy in that we will use the exoskeleton as a treatment tool for
perturbing the legs during locomotion, in order to generate heightened muscular activity and relevant motor
errors in the context of real-world tasks. Our central hypothesis is that the heightened neuromuscular activity
during our exoskeleton gait training will result in clinically relevant gait improvements that will be tightly connected
with beneficial neuroplasticity in the spinal cord and key brain circuits that govern the leg motor actions. The
Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To quantify the degree of mobility changes in transition aged persons (16-
25 years) with CP who undergo our innovative robotic exoskeleton gait training protocol, and (2) To identify
whether transition aged persons with CP who undergo our robotic exoskeleton gait training protocol exhibit
greater neurophysiological alterations in the key brain circuits and spinal cord dynamics that are involved in
planning and executing leg motor actions. In brevity, the experimental design of this project involves transition
aged persons with CP who will undergo 24 physical therapy sessions while wearing a robotic exoskeleton that
will perturb the spatiotemporal gait kinematics during an overground therapeutic gait training protocol. Baseline
and post-therapy measures will include clinical mobility assessments (Functional Gait Assessment, fast-as-
possible 10-meter walk, 1-minute walk, time up and down stairs), magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain
imaging, and Hoffman reflex (i.e., H-reflex) assessments of the spinal cord interneuron dynamics. Clinical
outcomes will be compared with a cohort of persons with CP that undergo standard gait training without using
the exoskeleton. Beneficial outcomes from this clinical trial will create a new perspective on the use of robotic
exoskeletons as a therapeutic tool for improving the gait of persons with CP."
10753048,"Background: Moral injury symptoms include guilt, shame, and self-isolation. Moral injury is also
associated with increased suicide risk. Moral injury symptoms are common in Veterans being
treated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or substance use disorder (SUD) and current
treatments do not always improve these symptoms. The Mental Health Clinician / Chaplain
Collaboration (MC3) intervention is delivered by VA chaplains who facilitate forgiveness and
community reintegration. MC3 is a collaboration between resources in the mental health clinic,
chaplain service, and community to support moral injury symptom recovery.
Significance: MC3 addresses the VA HSR&D research priority of mental health including
PTSD because moral injury symptoms are often comorbid with PTSD. MC3 also addresses the
HSR&D cross-cutting principle of coordinating and integrating care, in this case between mental
health, chaplain, and community resources. The MC3 intervention is also consistent with the
following VHA goals: the National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide 2018-2028 (i.e.,
clinical and community prevention), integrating VA and community resources (i.e., MISSION
Act), and learning healthcare system priorities (i.e., multidisciplinary research methods).
Innovation & Impact: The new directions associated with MC3 are utilizing VA chaplains to
facilitate forgiveness and community reintegration. If MC3 is successful, then Veterans will have
an intervention that does not stop at the doors of the VA facility but takes advantage of
community resources that already exist to facilitate long-term recovery in a community of the
Veteran’s choosing. The explicit focus on community reintegration is what sets MC3 apart from
other moral injury interventions.
Specific Aims:
1. Pre-implementation: Adapt the intervention that was originally delivered by community clergy
 for delivery by VA chaplains. Stakeholders in this process will include VA chaplains and
 mental health clinicians at the Little Rock and Pittsburgh VAMCs.
2. Conduct a single arm pilot study (total N = 20 across 2 sites) of the MC3 intervention to
 assess feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity (primary outcomes).
3. Post-implementation: Conduct a formative evaluation with stakeholders of the recruitment
 methods, MC3 intervention, and outcome measures. This information will be used to refine
 the MC3 intervention and study procedures for a subsequent RCT.
Methodology: The study design is a two site one arm trial. The population is Veterans being
treated in specialty mental health who have symptoms of moral injury. MC3 will be delivered by
VA chaplains who will facilitate forgiveness and community reintegration. The primary outcomes
are feasibility and acceptability. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at baseline
and 6-months (end of intervention). Evidence-based quality improvement methods will be used
to implement MC3 at the Little Rock and Pittsburgh VAMCs.
Next Steps/Implementation: Results from this study will inform a future randomized controlled
trial of MC3 versus Present Centered Therapy (PCT). PCT was chosen because other moral
injury interventions use PCT as a time and attention control condition and this will facilitate
comparison across studies. MC3 is sustainable because VA chaplains deliver the intervention,
and they are already integrated with VA mental health care and community resources."

The Notch signaling pathway directs cell fate decisions in diverse tissue contexts, plays key roles in disease,
and represents a major drug target. The pathway uses multiple ligands and receptors that interact with one
another in a promiscuous fashion, as well as Fringe glycosyltransferases that modulate those interactions.
Recent work from our lab suggests that these interactions comprise a communication ‘code’ in which different
ligands activate Notch receptors with distinct dynamics. These dynamics are, in turn, decoded to selectively
activate distinct transcriptional target programs. Current understanding of the code is limited to just two ligands
and one receptor. Determining how dynamic encoding occurs across a broader repertoire of
ligand-receptor-Fringe combinations will enable better understanding, prediction, and control of signaling
interactions between different cell types in diverse developmental and disease contexts. Here, we will combine
cell line engineering, quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging, direct control of Notch dynamics using mutant
receptors and pharmacological perturbations, and analysis of Notch dynamics in neural stem cells and chick
embryos to decipher this code and its functional roles. In ​Aim 1​, we will focus on encoding, by mapping
dynamic signaling modes across a full matrix of Notch receptor, ligand, and Fringe protein combinations. We
will further extend this approach to analyze co-expression of multiple Notch receptors in the same cell, a
pattern that occurs frequently in natural cell types. In ​Aim 2​, we will focus on decoding, by computationally and
experimentally investigating how cis-regulatory and trans-regulatory mechanisms together enable different
signaling dynamics to selectively activate distinct target gene expression programs. Finally, in ​Aim 3 we will
analyze the function of the Notch dynamic code in neurogenesis, using mouse neural stem cells and chick
embryonic spinal cord development as model systems. In neural stem cells, using a combination of
co-cultures, time-lapse microscopy, and end-point multiplexed single molecule RNA-FISH, we will map
ligand-receptor combinations to Notch activity dynamics, and relate those dynamics in turn to cell fate
decisions. In chick embryos, a Notch-specific fluorescent reporter, together with a new tissue slice preparation
that enables imaging of individual living cells during spinal cord development, will enable us to link Notch
dynamics to cell fate determination. Together, these results will reveal the structure and function of the
dynamic code underlying Notch signaling, and show how it operates in key developmental contexts. More
generally, they should help establish a paradigm for understanding signal encoding and decoding behaviors in
cellular communication systems."
10788443,"Cryptococcosis is an invasive mycotic disease caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. In the second
half of the 20th century, cryptococcosis increased dramatically in medical importance because of its association
with HIV infection, organ transplantation and immunosuppression caused by medical advances. Therapy with
antifungal drugs remains unsatisfactory, particularly in non-HIV cases, as the infection tends to be chronic,
difficult to eradicate and recur after therapy. There are no vaccines available for the prevention of
cryptococcosis, or for any other mycoses. Host defense against C. neoformans infection involves both humoral
and cellular mechanisms. C. neoformans is unusual in that it is the only encapsulated human pathogen and the
polysaccharide capsule is an absolute requirement for virulence. The major capsular polysaccharide is
glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). Antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide are protective providing a strong
rationale for the development of vaccines that target this antigen. This proposal seeks funds to develop a novel
conjugate vaccine based on synthetic and natural oligosaccharides, which will focus the resulting immune
response into making only protective antibodies. Conjugate vaccines have been remarkably successful in
reducing the incidence of several bacterial encapsulated pathogens and the same should be possible for
cryptococcosis. We plan to take advantage of all that we have learned about antibody-mediated immunity
against C. neoformans to develop a novel conjugate vaccine against a major human fungal pathogen. In
addition, two new developments provide a new approach to this problem: 1) advances in synthetic organic
chemistry have led to the generation of chemically defined oligosaccharides representing GXM motifs; and 2)
the discovery that C. neoformans makes large amounts of oligosaccharides in culture that are raw materials for
vaccine construction. The availability of new materials in the form of natural and synthetic oligosaccharides for
the polysaccharide component of the conjugate vaccine bring the promise of making highly immunogenic
compounds that focus the immune response to elicit only protective antibodies. Three aims are proposed: 1. To
establish the epitopes in C. neoformans GXM recognized by protective and non-protective antibodies; 2. To
generate a set of novel protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines based on natural and synthetic
oligosaccharides of expressing C. neoformans GXM structural motifs; 3. To establish the immunogenicity and
efficacy novel conjugate vaccines against experimental C. neoformans infection."
10788448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecules and mechanisms that mediate heme
trafficking and signaling in health and disease. Heme is an essential but potentially cytotoxic metallocofactor,
signaling molecule, and nutritional source of iron. All heme-dependent processes require that heme is safely
transported and trafficked from sites of uptake or synthesis to heme dependent or regulated proteins located
throughout the cell. However, the molecules and mechanisms that mediate the mobilization of heme for
trafficking and signaling are poorly understood. Further, the spatio-temporal dynamics of heme trafficking are
unknown. This is in large part due to the lack of tools available to image labile heme pools relevant to it
biodistribution. The Reddi lab has recently overcome these technological barriers by generating genetically
encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors and hemoproteomics approaches to characterize heme
trafficking and signaling dynamics. This proposal will focus on integrating molecular genetic, biochemical,
biophysical, cell biological, and chemical biology approaches towards elucidating: a. heme transport and
trafficking; b. heme-based signal transduction; and c. heme acquisition across a variety of model eukaryotic
cell lines, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cell lines, and pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and Candida albicans. To probe intracellular heme trafficking, genetically encoded heme sensors
will be used in gene deletion and over-expression screens to identify novel pathways for heme distribution and
trafficking. To probe heme signaling, hemoproteomics approaches and heme chelators will be deployed to
identify how heme signals are initiated, transmitted, and integrated to control metabolism and physiology. To
probe heme acquisition by human pathogens, heme sensors and hemoproteomics approaches will be
integrated to identify the mechanisms of heme uptake and utilization by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
Candida albicans. Altogether, the proposed research will comprehensively address the mechanisms of heme
trafficking and signaling in various contexts relevant to health and disease."
10784034,"Brain and Behavioral Mechanisms Linking Loneliness and Social Isolation with Accelerated Cognitive Aging
 and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias
Loneliness and social isolation (SIL) increase risk for all ten leading causes of death in the U.S. and are
strongly linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Reducing SIL
can foster healthy aging, improve mental and physical health, optimize quality of life, and prevent cognitive
decline and ADRD. However, healthcare has not capitalized on promoting social connection as preventive
medicine: it is not routinely assessed nor treated, in part because current data do not allow for definitive
conclusions about evidence-based approaches. Dr. Van Orden’s research aims to identify evidence-based
strategies for SIL—grounded in the study of mechanisms—to promote healthy aging and increase quality of life
for older adults. In line with NIA priorities of increasing understanding of the aging brain and ADRD; developing
interventions to address ADRD and promote healthy brain aging; and understanding mechanisms underlying
effective interventions, the objective of this mid-career K24 award in patient-oriented research (POR) is to
incorporate the study of cognition and healthy brain aging into Dr. Van Orden’s research on SIL interventions
to understand benefits for brain aging (and preventing ADRD) as well as identifying intervention targets to
optimize interventions. This K24 will allow her to develop capacity in interdisciplinary science in healthy brain
aging by co-mentoring clinical scientists who study ADRD as well as basic scientists in neuroscience (and
related disciplines) to foster development of a program of research on the translational science of SIL and its
role in brain aging. Dr. Van Orden’s long-term objective in POR is to identify and disseminate evidence-based
interventions for SIL in later life, including determining the mechanisms that account for improved health
outcomes—mental health, cognitive health, and physical health outcomes. The research project component of
this proposal is designed to advance the translational science of SIL and brain aging while producing an
optimal training laboratory for mentees. The scientific premise is that SIL and brain aging have reciprocal
associations that can result in a downward spiral towards unhealthy brain aging and ADRD, or with
intervention, an upward spiral towards healthy brain aging and social connection. To produce efficient training
for mentees, the project relies on published data (meta-analysis) and secondary analyses of completed trials
(from the PI’s laboratory and NIA-funded Roybal ADRD caregiving research center). The first aim is to examine
whether behavioral interventions for SIL improve cognitive functioning. The second aim it to examine baseline
cognitive impairment as a prognostic indicator for improvement in SIL. The third aim is to examine potential
mechanisms for non-compliance to SIL interventions. We will integrate findings with the published literature on
social and affective processing in SIL and the published literature on experimental studies with animal models
of SIL to develop a testable model of brain and behavioral mechanisms that simultaneously maintain SIL and
accelerate cognitive aging and that could serve as intervention targets to optimize interventions."
10784103,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Endophthalmitis causes a significant number of cases of blindness worldwide. Efforts to prevent damage
to delicate ocular tissues during infection rely on swift and proper use of therapeutics to rapidly kill organisms
and arrest potentially damaging inflammation. Currently-used antibiotics can kill organisms, but the effective-
ness of anti-inflammatory drugs is controversial. Because the intraocular inflammatory response during
endophthalmitis can damage sensitive and nonregenerative retinal tissue, identifying more effective anti-
inflammatory drugs which counteract or arrest these effects is critically needed.
 This new R21 proposal is based on the hypothesis that blocking the activity of innate immune pathways
can protect the eye against the damaging effects of inflammation during bacterial endophthalmitis. The
scientific premise of this work is based on: A) data highlighting the importance of innate immune pathway
activation in the eye during experimental bacterial endophthalmitis, B) the presence of key proinflammatory
mediators as an indicator of innate immune pathway activation in human and mouse eyes during bacterial
endophthalmitis, and C) preliminary data demonstrating that genetic absence or therapeutic blockade of innate
immune pathways arrests damaging inflammation in experimental bacterial endophthalmitis.
 We will test our hypothesis in experiments designed to determine the effectiveness of oxidized
phospholipids with clinically-used antibiotics in limiting inflammation during experimental bacterial
endophthalmitis. Our preliminary data demonstrates efficacy of an oxidized phospholipid (OxPAPC) in limiting
inflammation caused by Bacillus, one of the most aggressive ocular pathogens. Because inflammation in
endophthalmitis is driven by innate immune pathway activation, it is reasonable to posit that OxPAPC should
limit inflammation caused by less aggressive pathogens. In addition to formulating a more effective strategy for
Bacillus endophthalmitis by combining OxPAPC with clinically used antibiotics, we will test this strategy in
endophthalmitis caused by S. aureus, a leading cause of multidrug-resistant (MDR) post-cataract surgical,
intravitreal injection, and endogenous cases, as well as in Gram-negative endogenous endophthalmitis (EE)
caused by the ESKAPE pathogen Klebsiella, to probe broad-spectrum usage. Defining the efficacy of OxPAPC
in preventing ocular changes which preclude EE will provide additional data for this anti-inflammatory strategy.
 For endophthalmitis patients, ineffective treatment often equates with vision loss. Because
inflammation is a significant component of pathogenesis, arresting this response is critical to protecting the
eye. Our approach is novel for endophthalmitis, high-impact, translational, and will move the ocular
infectious disease field forward by identifying a rational and more effective anti-inflammation strategy. These
studies are a logical outgrowth of our research program, and we are ideally poised to contribute impactful
information which will improve therapeutic options for preserving vision during ocular infections."
10778882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a major driver of prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Persistent activation
of AR due to aberrant intratumoral androgen synthesis (ITAS) plays pivotal roles in resistance to therapies with
the next-generation AR signaling inhibitors (ARSI) such as abiraterone. In castrated males, besides androgens
produced by de novo synthesis from cholesterol, adrenal steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-
sulfate (DHEA-S) are the major precursors for ITAS. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1), encoded
by HSD3B1 gene, is a key 3βHSD enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the adrenal-derived steroids DHEA
and DHEA-S to testosterone. CHD1 is an epigenetic ‘reader’ that selectively recognizes methylated histone H3
lysine 4 such as H3K4me3, a transcription active chromatin mark. The CHD1 gene is deleted in 9-11% of both
primary and advanced PCa, stressing the relevance of loss of function of CHD1 in PCa pathogenesis and
progression. It has been shown that loss of CHD1 promotes AR cistrome redistribution and antiandrogen
resistance in PCa cells; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Our preliminary data showed that
CHD1 interacts with the SIN3A corepressor protein SIN3A and that loss of CHD1 induces elevation of the total
level of pan histone acetylation, increased expression of steroidogenesis genes and ITAS. We also showed that
upregulation of steroids genes including HSD3B1 induced by CHD1 loss associated with increased expression
of transcription factor HOXC13. Furthermore, we demonstrated that abiraterone treatment partially inhibits
growth of CHD1-deficient cells and this effect is abolished by concomitant depletion of HSD3B1. Based on our
novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that CHD1 functions as a transcription repressor by interacting with the
SIN3A corepressor, mediating transcription repression of the HOXC13 transcription factor and downregulation
androgenesis genes. However, loss of CHD1 results in transcriptional de-repression of HOXC13, which in turn
induces aberrant expression of androgenesis genes, abnormal intratumoral androgen synthesis, and resistance
to ARSI therapies in PCa. Aberrantly elevated 3βHSD1 and increased androgenesis represent actionable
vulnerabilities for effective treatment of CHD1-deficient PCa cells. To test these hypotheses, we will determine
the molecular mechanism and extent to which CHD1 interacts with SIN3A and modulates histone acetylation
and transcriptional outputs in PCa (Aim 1); determine the molecular mechanism and functional importance of
HOXC13 in upregulation of steroidogenesis genes and castration-resistant growth of CHD1-deficient PCa (Aim
2); and determine clinical significance and ant-cancer efficacy of pre-clinical therapeutic targeting of the
deregulated CHD1-HOXC13-3βHSD1 signaling axis in PCa (Aim 3). Findings from this application will shed new
light on the novel transcription repression function of CHD1, the pivotal role of the HOXC13-HSD3B1 axis in
aberrant androgen synthesis and castration resistance in CHD1-deficient prostate cancer, and identification of
new actionable targets for effective treatment of this subtype of prostate cancer."

ABSTRACT
Delirium is the most common complication of surgery and anesthesia in older patients, afflicting 15-60% of
those having non-cardiac procedures. This is a major clinical problem because nearly 40% of surgical
procedures are performed on older patients and delirium is associated with serious morbidity, including
accelerated decline to dementia. Still, the cause of postoperative delirium is uncertain and its
neuropathogenesis is unknown. Cerebral neurodegenerative pathology characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease
and related disorders is common even in cognitively normal older people, and by the time even mild symptoms
develop is pronounced. We hypothesize that this preexisting burden of occult cerebral neurodegeneration
accounts for enhanced vulnerability to postoperative delirium (Aim 1), augments surgery- and delirium-induced
cerebral injury (Aim 2), and fuels surgery- and delirium-induced inflammation, which aggravates neural injury
and increases neurodegeneration (Aim 3). We will test these hypotheses in a longitudinal prospective
observational study of older surgical patients evaluated preoperatively for cognitive impairment and followed
postoperatively for delirium and longer-term cognitive decline, with neurodegeneration and neural injury
defined by ultrasensitive plasma biomarkers and cerebral MR imaging. This project is innovative because it
addresses the key question of whether surgery and anesthesia produce delirium and persistent cognitive
decline de novo or by unmasking or exacerbating a cerebral precondition and is significant because of the
magnitude of the clinical problems (neurodegenerative disease, delirium), practicality of the approach (blood-
based biomarkers), and potential to improve the outcomes of vulnerable older surgical patients.

 Infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is generally controlled but often not eliminated by host
immune responses. In humans and many other hosts, this persistent infection ultimately results in muscle tissue
damage known as Chagas disease. It is widely accepted that the early detection and rapid treatment of T. cruzi improves
treatment outcomes and reduces the chances of heart damage and that parasitological cure could provide lasting
immunity to reinfection and disease. However, there are limited data that specifically support these ideas. In addition to
humans, T. cruzi also impacts many other mammalian species, among these dogs, that develop very similar patterns of
immune control, disease development, and response to therapy, as humans. The project proposed herein takes
advantage of a natural setting of high intensity infection in working dogs in south Texas to address questions of critical
importance to the management of infection and disease in humans exposed to infection by T. cruzi. The question of the
relative benefit of treatment soon after infection will be explored by comparing treatment outcomes using a new, high
rate-of-cure treatment regimen, delivered to dogs either within months of infection, or delayed by several years.
Treatment success will be evaluated using parasitological (deeply sampled blood qPCR and hemoculture), immunological
(declining antibody titers) and clinical disease (blood cardiac troponin concentration, EKG and echocardiographic
changes). In dogs in which parasitological cure is achieved by drug therapy, we will determine the long-term benefits of
prior infection exposure by assessing reinfection rates and resistance to cardiac disease for dogs in this setting of high
transmission risk. The immunological correlates of increased resistance to infection and disease will be determined by
comparing the potency of anti-T. cruzi humoral and cellular immune responses to reinfection potential and ultimate
pattern of disease. Lastly, the benefit of a reduced parasite burden, rather than parasitological cure, to disease
development will be investigated in this same setting.
 Overall, this project takes advantage of one of the major benefits of work in Chagas disease, that of the highly
similar course of infection and disease in naturally infected non-human mammals, to investigate questions of prime
importance to the management of human Chagas disease. The work takes advantage of the cumulative and broad skill
set of scientists and clinicians with a long history of work in human and animal Chagas disease and established record of
collaboration in this highly accessible, high infection-risk setting.
 Completion of these studies will provide information that for ethical and infection dynamic reasons is likely
unattainable in humans but that is highly relevant to designing strategies for management of T. cruzi infection in
humans, including assessment of the need for very early detection and treatment, the requirement or not for
parasitologic cure for the prevention of clinical disease, and the likelihood of reinfections and subsequent clinical disease
in subjects who have received curative treatments."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH), which causes right ventricular failure (RVF), is a life-threatening disease with
limited long-term treatment options and a 5-year survival rate of only 50% despite advances in medical therapy,
which temporarily ameliorate it. Lung transplant is the only definitive treatment; however, PH patients can acutely
deteriorate and become ineligible for transplant. It is difficult to predict and intervene prior to RVF due to the
limited physiologic understanding about end-stage PH and also because patients with severe PH do not tolerate
exercise testing that would otherwise better predict their prognosis. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support (MCS)
technology, notably extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), is used sometimes to rescue patients with
PH-RVF and has occasionally served as a bridge to lung transplant. However, it is a limited intervention because
of its many technological shortcomings: its complexity of operation, poor durability and biocompatibility, and
bulky size that limits patient mobility and ambulatory use. Moreover, ECMO does not address the specific
physiologic and metabolic deficits incurred by end-stage PH patients, which change drastically between rest and
exercise states and remain poorly characterized. Due to the ethical challenges and barriers of studying severe
PH in clinical subjects, our team proposes to use a large animal model to address this challenging disease. We
will use our group’s high-fidelity large animal model of PH-RVF that utilizes progressive pulmonary artery banding
approach in sheep subjects. Our prior work with this animal model has demonstrated that the sheep subjects
accurately recapitulate the clinical pathophysiology of PH that spans across multiple organ systems. Using our
established expertise with this animal model, we will first reveal the exercise limitations associated with this
severe disease, and use this physiologic understanding to develop a more durable, wearable MCS that can
support patients with end-stage PH-RVF. Under Aim 1, the PH-RVF sheep subjects will undergo treadmill
exercise testing to characterize the longitudinal changes in cardiopulmonary reserve, metabolism, and exercise
tolerance during disease progression. Under Aim 2, the PH-RVF sheep will receive 14 days of MCS to address
the specific physiologic and metabolic deficits that were characterized under Aim 1. The novel portable MCS
system consists of low-resistance, low-profile, highly biocompatible gas exchangers coupled with a ventricular
assist device pump. The mode of attachment will be varied between two optimized configurations (right atrium-
left atrium, RA-LA, and right atrium-aorta, RA-Ao) that were narrowed down in our team’s previous investigation,
R01HL140231. During 14 days of wearable device support, RV and device function will be studied under
conditions of dynamic exercise induced stress using multi-scale analysis to assess the impact on RV recovery
and end-organ function. We hypothesize that RA-LA will better provide physiologic restoration of blood flow, RV
function, and exercise tolerance compared to RA-Ao."

fluid-filled cysts in the kidney and liver and 5-10% of all kidney failure. The one FDA-approved therapy provides
only a modest delay in ongoing growth of cysts in the kidney and liver that can progress to kidney failure and
devastating abdominal pain. Approximately one third of ADPKD patients have non-truncating mutations in the
primary disease gene PKD1/Polycystin-1(PC1), and a significant subset of these likely encode a version of
PC1 that is pathogenic because of a quantitative rather than qualitative deficit at its site of action on the cell
surface due to inefficient maturation of PC1. PC1 “dosage”—the functional amount of PC1 protein at its site of
action—correlates with disease severity. Our laboratory has contributed to the identification of additional
disease genes to explain cases of symptomatic polycystic liver disease (PLD) resulting from in inefficient
maturation of PC1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Proof of concept studies using genomic alterations in
mice suggest cysts could be avoided in these patients if more PC1 was expressed. Recent studies inhibiting
microRNA 17 from repressing Pkd1 mRNA have provided benefit to a Pkd1 missense mouse model. We
hypothesize that increasing PC1 protein expression in patients with mutations in these ER genes and
in a substantial subset of patients with PKD1 non-truncating mutations in ADPKD will dramatically
reduce cyst burden.
We have identified that the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) of human PKD1 contains alternative sites of translation
known as upstream open reading frames (uORFs) whose translation significantly blunts the translation of PC1
from PKD1 mRNA in vitro. Our in vitro data shows that interventions to block PKD1 uORF translation results in
3-4 times more PC1 protein, and that blocking uORF translation is achievable using antisense oligonucleotides
(ASO). ASOs are approved therapies for patients with other diseases.
For this proposal we will determine the role of PKD1 uORFs on cyst formation in vivo. We have made a
novel humanized PKD1 5’UTR mouse model with or without single nucleotide edits to remove uORF initiation
codons and we will use this to test effect of uORFs in two models of ADPKD (Dnajb11 model and a Pkd1
p.R2216W model) as well as quantify effect in primary cells in different biological contexts to consider a role for
in vivo regulation. Independently, we will test our hypothesis that ASOs targeting PKD1 uORFs are effective
treatment in mouse models of ADPKD and would be—due to ability to effect translation efficiency—a unique,
specific, and additive approach to any previously proposed therapies."
10771180,"The lung is a major portal for respirable environmental toxicants including heavy metals such as arsenic
(As), cadmium (Cd), and manganese (Mn), all of which are recognized to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). COPD is the third largest cause of mortality in the US. The prevalence of COPD is twice
as high in the Affected Area in Birmingham, Alabama where the Superfund site is located when compared to
the Control Area. Peptidyl arginine deiminase-2 enzyme (PAD2) in lung macrophages is activated by heavy
metals in a calcium dependent manner and induces deimination (citrullination) of vimentin to citrullinated vimentin
by the irreversible alteration of the arginine residue to the non-coded citrulline residue. Our hypothesis is that
exposure to particulate matter containing heavy metals (As, Cd and Mn) leads to induction and activation of
peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 in lung macrophages and deimination of vimentin. Activation of TLR4 in airway
fibroblasts by deiminated(citrullinated) vimentin leads to a pro-invasive, pro-fibrogenic phenotype, with
subsequent airway remodeling and COPD. We will examine this hypothesis in the following specific aims:
Aim 1: We will use a novel, selective pharmacologic inhibitor of PAD2 (AFM30a) as well as a pan PAD inhibitor
(BB-Cl-amidine) to evaluate if this leads to inhibition of citrullination of vimentin. We will also evaluate if
citrullinated vimentin modulates airway fibroblast into an invasive, phenotype in 3D lung pulmospheres through
upregulation of TLR4 in vitro. Aim 2: Determine whether heavy metal exposure leads to airway remodeling in a
murine model of COPD and is associated with the activation of PAD2, the citrullination and secretion of vimentin
and an invasive profibrotic phenotype of lung fibroblast. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PAD2 will block
the development of COPD. We will use TLR4-/- mice to evaluate if citrullinated vimentin directly causes airway
remodeling and COPD as well as an invasive pro-fibrogenic phenotype of fibroblasts using 3D lung
pulmospheres. Aim 3: Determine whether PAD2 and citrullinated vimentin, present in lung macrophages, BAL,
plasma and EBC of a cohort of subjects from the Affected Area are biomarkers for COPD. Existing biospecimens
have been tested in a discovery cohort of subjects and prospective testing will be conducted in a validation cohort
of COPD subjects in parallel with airway fractal dimension (AFD) on CT scans, plasma and exhaled breath
condensate (EBC) measurements. Early biomarkers of COPD in exhaled breath condensate may help us
recognize disease susceptibility. Importantly, these studies may provide novel therapeutic strategies to
block the effects of PAD2 in patients with chronic lung disease such as COPD."
10771184,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The heavy metals, cadmium, arsenic, and manganese, have been identified at high levels in
the air and soil of the Affected Area (proposed Superfund site). Heavy metals released into the
environment have a significant effect on respiratory health. Although the pathogenesis of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are complex, the environmental
exposure to heavy metals is often overlooked in the development of these diseases. Lower
respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a main cause of COPD and asthma exacerbations, which
contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these diseases. The residents of the Affected Area
have 30% higher diagnosed LRTIs than residents from the Control Area. Lung macrophages
have a critical role in host defense to respiratory pathogens. Lung macrophages not only initiate
an innate immune response to infection and injury, but they are also involved in repair of injury.
Alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) are injured during infection that results in lung injury by disruption
of the cellular barrier. It is not known if heavy metals regulate the macrophage phenotype to
hinder the repair of the AEC barrier function. We hypothesize that exposure to heavy metals
exacerbates LRTI and lung injury due to the persistence of a classically activated phenotype in
lung macrophages. This persistence impairs the repair of the alveolar epithelium after injury.
The goals of Aim 1 are to determine if heavy metal-exposed mice have increased bacterial or
viral load, lung injury, and mortality compared to vehicle-exposed mice infected with S.
pneumoniae or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) due to the persistence of classically activated
lung macrophages. In Aim 2 we will utilize genetic approaches to determine the mechanism(s)
by which macrophages maintain persistent classical activation. The goals of Aim 3 are to
determine if macrophage phenotypic switching is impaired in residents from the Affected Area
compared to the Control Area and if BAL fluid from residents in the Affected Area impairs wound
closure and increases permeability of injured AEC. Studies from Project 3 will define the
molecular mechanism(s) by which heavy metal exposure increases LRTIs in residents of the
Affected Area and proposed Superfund site, providing a potential therapeutic target to reduce
the exacerbations seen in these chronic lung diseases."
10771186,"Environmental/Engineering: Project #4. Advanced approaches to quantifying exposure to heavy metals
Project Summary
 Historic and ongoing air, water, and soil pollution in North Birmingham results in area contamination with
heavy metals and other toxic compounds and poses high health risk in the neighborhood. Analytical techniques
for heavy metal (HM) detection are essential for understanding mechanisms of HM induced lung injury and
efficiency of mechanical and chemical remediation of pollution. Majority of current analytical techniques for HM
detection such as Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Atomic Absorption
Spectrophotometry (AAS) are not portable, require large amount of sample (ICP-MS), not always sufficiently
sensitive, slow, and require advanced procedures for sample preparation.
 Our hypothesis is that development of a novel femto-LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy)/
LEAFS (laser excited atomic fluorescence spectroscopy) and middle infrared frequency comb “Optical
Nose” systems will enable ultrasensitive and rapid detection of Cd, Mn, As, and biomarkers associated
with exposure to these metals.
 LIBS is a rapid, real-time analytical technique based on the analysis of the spectral emission from laser
induced sparks. The method enables fast and sensitive chemical analysis of any kind of matter (solid, liquid or
gas) without sample preparation. Detection limits for LIBS using nanosecond laser pulses are typically in ppms
for HMs. Excitation using laser pulses with femtosecond (fs) duration (f-LIBS) may provide significant
improvement in detection limit. Our group recently demonstrated breakthrough in development of fs lasers based
on chromium doped ZnS/Se crystals and showed that these systems feature several essential advantages for
fs laser spectroscopy applications. These lasers will be a foundation for two f-LIBS platforms (for bulk and
microscopic samples). For the applications where ppb/ppt sensitivity is required we will combine f-LIBS platform
with LEAFS enabling superior sensitivity (sub-ppt) similar to prototypes developed earlier by our group.
 Our objective will be also to extend current visible-near IR frequency-comb techniques to molecules
“fingerprint” mid-IR spectral range. This optical nose platform to be developed will be based on a dual-comb
Fourier-transform spectroscopy with fs oscillators emitting in the mid-IR based on our recent breakthrough in fs
lasers and their frequency down-conversion. The plan includes the development of 2-20 μm frequency combs
on the basis of Cr:ZnS/Se fs laser and its intra-pulse difference frequency generation using ZnGeP2, GaSe,
and/or orientation patterned GaP nonlinear crystals. This planned instrument will provide a real time total profile
of the trace gas contents in complex gas mixtures and will be offered to other projects of the proposal for sensing
biomarkers associated with HM exposure."
10771190,"Project Abstract:
Historic air, water and soil pollution in North Birmingham from complex industrial processes
resulted in surface and air contamination with heavy metals and other toxic compounds.
Resuspension of particulate matter due to weathering, traffic, industrial and other human
activities containing some of the heavy metal particles from soil could pose high health-risk in
the neighborhood. It has been determined that soil in some of the properties contains high level
of metals such as Cd, As, Mn, etc. On the other hand continuous open pit mining operations
including large piles of waste and ash represent permanent sources of the pollutants emission
and measures of site isolation and remediation are necessary. The goal of the “Nano-Micro
Hybrid Fibrous Materials for Contaminant Removal and Site Remediation” project is to fabricate
and field-test a number of affordable high surface area carbonaceous / meso-micro porous
hybrid materials fabricated from natural-fibers, industrial carbon fiber waste and carbon fiber
derived from textile grade precursor which would be effective for removal of contaminants from
soil and for air filtration in households. The target contaminants are heavy metals such as Cd,
Mn and As which are usually attached to/present in particulate matter in air and soil. Activated
carbon fibers (ACF) derived from low cost- sources will have high surface area and surface
functionalities to synergistically combine filtration and adsorption of HM with affordability and
sustainability of multiscale mat/adsorbent. Multidisciplinary UAB team and UT/ORNL
manufacturing team jointly provides a unique platform for collaboration for the successful
execution of the proposal. Accordingly in Specific Aim 1, we chemically and physically
functionalize the natural fiber derived CF for effective adsorption/filtration of HM. In Specific Aim
2, a thorough characterization for surface are pore-geometry, volume of various CFs. In Specific
Aim 3, we will carry out feasibility production of controlled material forms for filtration and field-
testing for remediation. We will work closely with other projects (1-4) and cores (Data
Management and Analysis Core support, DMA the Administrative and Research Translation
Core) to translate research findings to expedite the use of project outcomes by end-users
focused on risk assessment and remediation management of exposure to hazardous
substances (Cd, As, Mn)."
10771194,"CORE SUMMARY – DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS CORE
Real-life exposures to hazardous substances from Superfund sites occur as mixtures of many contaminants. To
improve and protect human health from exposure to hazardous substances, Superfund Research Programs
(SRPs) must integrate biomedical research with environmental science and engineering. The integration of
data from the diverse scientific disciplines in SRPs is critical if we are to fully understand the link between
exposures and disease, and prevent adverse health outcomes. Therefore, the data generated by the SRP
represents an important research product that requires best practices for quality assurance, dissemination and
interoperability. The primary objective of the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) is to discover,
implement and promulgate best practices for fostering and enabling the interoperability of data between
biomedical research projects and environmental science and engineering projects to accomplish the goals of
the overall Superfund Research Center. We will coordinate the development and refinement of an integrated
data management plan for the entire Center. We will work closely with project & core leaders to identify data
sharing platforms and to prioritize datasets for sharing across the program. We will establish data sharing
guidelines and timelines. We will also continue to provide expert statistics for experimental design and
multivariate data analyses. We will continue to develop and maintain software that provides an integrated data
workflow for raw experimental data, important sample metadata, and downstream analysis pipelines. We will
continue to model dose-response curves and biological response data. We will customize the Experimental
Data Management System with data templates for all projects. We will also implement new data visualizations
in our Superfund Analytics Tool to facilitate data sharing across projects and cores. We will apply novel deep-
learning algorithms to all processed data streams in to link PAH exposure to outcome, and to ultimately predict
the effects of PAH mixtures on biological systems. We will work closely with project and core leaders to ensure
high data quality throughout the lifecycle of data generation. We will review data, document quality control
procedures that account for experimental, technical, or systematic problems, and resolve problems at each step
of the data life cycle. We will integrate results across all research projects and cores, and we will train the next
generation of toxicologists to analyze their own data."
10771196,"CORE SUMMARY – CHEMICAL MIXTURES CORE
Superfund sites contain mixtures of many contaminants. The US EPA Supplemental Guidance for Conducting
Health Risk Assessments of Chemicals stated that “approaches based on whole mixtures are preferred to
component approaches”. The research community needs robust, analyte-rich methods suitable for complex
matrixes. The scientific community needs new, specialized, more sensitive methods to separate, detect, and
quantify dozens of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and substituted PAHs with widely varying
concentrations and chemical properties in complex, heterogeneous matrices. These challenges continue to
drive the development of analytical methods for PAHs, substituted PAHs and PAH transformation products, as
well as Superfund co-contaminants. It is demanding to analyze PAHs and x-PAHs in environmental and
biological matrices because the samples are complex, the numerous isomers of alkylated and high-molecular-
mass compounds are often difficult to differentiate, and we often lack standards and suitable reference
materials. The primary goal of the Chemistry Mixtures Core (CMC) is to support other Superfund Center
projects and cores. We will maximize their access to quality-assured quantitative analytical technologies and
empower them to increase their creativity and knowledge. We will create new and improved methods for
PAHs, PAH metabolites, and substituted PAHs (e.g., alkyl-, oxygen- and nitrogen- substituted PAHs). We will
collaborate with the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) to improve our unique web-based interface
for requesting standards, certified reference materials and submitting samples. We will develop and improve
our high-volume data production and management platform. We will expand the 1,530-analyte screen by
continuing to develop reductionist methods for mixture analysis. We will create bioavailable real-world
reference materials from Superfund soil, sediment and water extracts in collaboration with the environmental
projects and provide these materials to the biological projects. We will provide web-based training material for
analytical methods and bio-analytical technologies to center investigators and trainees."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection can lead to the deadly disease acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). During the natural infection of HIV-1, some viral DNAs are integrated into host genome, but
the vast majority of viral DNAs exist in an unintegrated state. Transcriptional regulation of unintegrated HIV-1
DNA plays important roles in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis. In contrast to the robust viral gene expression
from integrated viral DNA, the extrachromosomal, unintegrated viral DNAs are very poorly transcribed. The exact
mechanisms for the silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA are not well understood, which constitutes a major
knowledge gap in HIV-1 research. HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr enhances viral gene expression from
unintegrated HIV-1 DNA by targeting host proteins for degradation. In search for Vpr target host factor(s) that
can silence unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, we have performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening of Vpr target
genes and identified NS1BP. We also found that NS1BP-interacting partner, the SMC1A/3 cohesin complex, is
required for the silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA. We hypothesize that NS1BP acts as a cofactor to facilitate
the loading of the SMC1A/3 cohesin complex on viral DNA, which results in viral chromatin compaction and gene
suppression, and Vpr-mediated degradation of NS1BP results in the dissociation of the cohesin complex from
viral DNA, which consequently depresses the silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA. In this project, we will
determine the mechanism by which NS1BP and the SMC1A/3 cohesin complex mediate the silencing of
unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (Aim 1), and elucidate the mechanism by which Vpr antagonizes the silencing mediated
by NS1BP and the cohesin complex (Aim 2). Our proposed studies will significantly extend our understanding of
the molecular mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and provide new
information regarding the epigenetic silencing of HIV-1 DNA. In the long term, these studies will provide new
targets and strategies for the cure of HIV-1 infection."
10912022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than half of the world’s population is urban. While economic opportunities often drive migration to urban
settings, the benefits of increased economic opportunity, environmental and health infrastructure in cities is not
adequate or equitable. While urban areas may have greater sanitation coverage, those in densely populated,
slum communities experience disparities in distribution, quality, and continuity of these water and sanitation
services. In conjunction with government investment, the issues of collective action, stakeholder engagement,
inclusive and sustainable practices remain critical to impactful urban sanitation solutions. Addressing the major
barriers to effective urban sanitation interventions such as building mechanisms for communication between the
residents of the vulnerable communities and the service providers at scale has the potential to make a
tremendous impact on health and well-being. Mobile health technology has tremendous potential to gather data
directly from the underserved populations in need of sustainable water and sanitation solutions and enhance the
inclusion of vulnerable populations in the participatory construction of these solutions.
The primary purpose of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a mobile health technology program to enhance
urban sanitation interventions in densely populated and marginalized urban communities to increase connections
and engagement with sanitation interventions, and result in reduced environmental contamination. Through
formative research, a pilot feasibility investigation, and a validation study, we will determine the ability of the
mHealth program to enhance urban sanitation interventions."

 Flavor is a multi-sensory percept involving taste, olfaction, thermosensation and mechanosensation. Such
flavor profiles affect food consumption and nutritional intake in humans. Behavioral and anatomical studies
provide strong premise for a role for oral somesthesis in flavor perception, and food texture has long been
appreciated as a cause of food rejection; however, mechanisms by which mechanosensory neurons influence
taste in the mammalian nervous system are poorly defined. Fundamental open questions include: what are the
identities of mechanosensory neurons in the tongue? What are the ion channels that underlie mammalian tongue
mechanosensation? The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate how mechanosensory neurons
influence flavor perception.
 We previously identified putative mechanosensory endings in the tongue through anatomical analysis, yet
our preliminary functional findings suggest that there are likely more classes of mechanosensory neurons
innervating the tongue. The Aims proposed in this project will characterize the anatomical, functional, and
molecular properties of tongue innervating mechanoreceptors (Aim 1), and identify mechanotransduction

Cervical cancer is a highly preventable malignancy caused by high-risk human papillomavirus
(hrHPV) but is not fully prevented, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
Women living with HIV (WWH) have higher rates of hrHPV infection and 6-fold higher rates of
invasive cervical cancer. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of cervical cancer
globally, as well as the highest global burden of HIV. The Einstein/Rwanda Research and
Capacity Building Program (ER-RCBP) has been conducting research in cervical cancer
prevention for Rwandan WWH since 2005, conducting community- and clinic-based research in
screening uptake, screening modalities, assessing HPV vaccine effectiveness, evaluating how
to implement innovative screening approaches, and developing pathology and molecular
laboratory capacity. We have enrolled nearly 10,000 women WWH and 3,000 HIV-negative
women in studies of cervical HPV infection and disease. ER-RCBP’s primary partner in this
application, and in prior research in HIV services and cervical cancer prevention, is the Rwanda
Biomedical Center (RBC), the implementation arm of Rwanda’s Ministry of Health for healthcare
delivery and research. Rwanda has an extremely effective HIV healthcare program, an equally
effective program for HPV vaccination of girls, and has recently launched a cervical cancer
screening and prevention program with primary HPV testing followed by visual inspection of the
cervix and immediate treatment with thermal ablation, if indicated, for screen-positive women.
Rwanda is thus an ideal location for testing strategies for effective cervical cancer screening in a
low-income country with a high burden of HIV, cervical cancer, and a large unscreened
population. We propose here a clinical trials site in Rwanda as part of the CASCADE Clinical
Trials Network for Cervical Cancer Prevention. Lessons learned in Rwanda can be generalized
to many low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa."

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common type of kidney cancer, is characterized by deregulated
hypoxic signaling, metabolic defects, and complex immune cell infiltrate in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Loss of the oxygen sensing gene, von Hippel Lindau (VHL), is a critical early event in ccRCC pathogenesis and
promotes stabilization of hypoxia inducible (transcription) factors (HIF) that upregulate pro-growth signaling
pathways, including aerobic glycolysis, regardless of oxygen availability. This phenomenon is termed “pseudo-
hypoxia.” The most frequent immune types affecting ccRCC are functionally impaired CD8 tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (CD8 TIL) and metabolically enhanced tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Advancements in
immune oncology have led to improved overall patient outcomes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
therapy; however, current modalities do not result in durable responses for the majority of ccRCC patients. I
propose that features linked to pseudo-hypoxic signaling promote alterations in cancer cell energetic
requirements that impact immune cell function in the TME and revealing these aspects may provide new
opportunities for therapy. My preliminary data indicate that Vhl loss favors a mature TAM myeloid phenotype
with enhanced mitochondrial metabolism in murine RCC, and this result is consistent with enhanced metabolism
observed in the myeloid compartment of human ccRCC. Additionally, TAM suppression of CD8 TIL may be
enhanced by specific interactions with cancer cells, though exact TAM functions are not understood. In this
proposal, I will test the hypothesis that pseudo-hypoxic signals from cancer cells in the TME
preferentially support a metabolically active TAM subset that promotes CD8 TIL suppression and that
inhibiting TAM activity will enhance the CD8 TIL response to ICB therapy. To test the cancer cell pseudo-
hypoxic effect on TAM function I have developed a fine needle aspiration-based patient-derived organoid (FNA-
PDO) model that recapitulates key factors of the TME in human tumors. I will also employ a pair of murine
syngeneic Renca cell line models (Vhl WT and Vhl KO) to address the impact of pseudo-hypoxia on the TME in
vivo. I will: (1) Test if pseudo-hypoxia supports a unique TAM phenotype with distinct metabolism; and (2), Test
the role of TAM in T cell suppression and ICB response. Ultimately, these studies will advance our current
understanding of kidney cancer biology by demonstrating mechanisms that shape the TME and highlighting new
strategies to improve immunotherapy."

Dr. Joseph’s long-term goal is to become an independent physician-investigator specializing in identification of
neonatal and infant precursors to the development of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and early
interventions aimed at preventing symptom expression in children at risk for ADHD. She has expertise in
assessment and treatment of ADHD from childhood to adulthood. This K23 career development award will
allow her to emerge as one of the few physician-investigators prepared to evaluate neonates and infants at risk
for developmental disorders. In recent work Dr. Joseph evaluated child behaviors among preschool-aged
children born to fathers with and without childhood ADHD. She found that children at familial risk for ADHD
were observed to have dysregulated behavior as early as 3 years of age, a potential indicator of the eventual
development of ADHD. To study earlier precursors of ADHD, Dr. Joseph aims to receive training in (1) the
longitudinal course of childhood ADHD including the variability in ADHD symptoms over time and range of
functional outcomes (2) the cognitive development of attention from birth through childhood to understand how
inattention in infancy may serve as an early indicator of atypical development; and (3) advanced statistical
methods in the analysis of longitudinal data. These aims will be accomplished through a combination of
coursework, directed readings, and tutorials. Dr. Joseph’s mentorship team is comprised of Drs. Brooke Molina
(primary mentor), a leader in the field of ADHD specializing in course and outcomes for individuals with the
disorder, Jana Iverson (co-mentor), an expert in atypical development and identification of infants at-risk for
neurodevelopmental disorders, and Erik Thiessen (secondary mentor), a specialist in the cognitive
development in infancy, along with knowledgeable consultants with complementary skill sets. The University of
Pittsburgh offers a strong research environment in which to train with supports for professional development
and infrastructure to aid in participant recruitment. Offspring (N=100), half with a parent with ADHD, will be
assessed serially as neonates (brith-1 month) and infants (8-10 months) with parent reported behavior
collected in toddlerhood (18 months) to compare indices of attention in offspring at high vs. low risk for ADHD
(Aim 1) and evaluate neonate and infant indices of attention as predictors of toddler attention (Aim 2). Parent’s
joint attention with their infant will be examined in relation to parent ADHD status and offspring attention in
toddlerhood (Aim 3). Data from this project may provide initial evidence for the utility of novel early markers of
childhood inattention detectable in the first year of life, a critical step towards early identification and
intervention for childhood ADHD. The proposed study aligns with NIMH strategic objective 2 to chart mental
illness trajectories including characterization of developmental dimensions in behavior to determine optimal
timing of intervention."

Genomes are plagued by parasitic DNA sequences that do not promote health or fertility. Meiotic drive genes
are one such class of genetic parasite that selfishly manipulate gametogenesis to increase their own
transmission into the next generation. Rather than being passed to half of an individual’s offspring, like regular
alleles, meiotic drivers manipulate gametogenesis to ensure their transmission to most, or even all, the
offspring. Drivers are found throughout eukaryotes, including humans, but many more likely remain to be
identified. Characterizing meiotic drivers is important because these parasites can have major impacts on
fertility and health. Meiotic drivers can contribute to infertility directly by disrupting meiotic chromosome
segregation or by destroying gametes that inherit the competing allele. Meiotic drivers can also cause infertility
or other disease states indirectly by promoting the spread of linked deleterious (e.g., disease-associated)
alleles. Despite their large impact, there is relatively little molecular understanding of meiotic drivers or their
evolutionary impacts. However, there are emerging themes that unite many known drive systems, including the
use of a poison/antidote mechanism and the association of meiotic drive genes with distributed DNA sequence
repeats. This proposal exploits a highly tractable model, the wtf gene family found in fission yeasts, to
investigate the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary impacts of drive systems. The wtf genes enact drive
by destroying the wtf- gametes produced by wtf+/wtf- heterozygotes. Each wtf driver encodes both a poison
protein and a separate antidote protein on overlapping coding sequences. All developing gametes are
poisoned, but those that inherit the wtf+ allele are rescued by the antidote. This proposal aims to understand
the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of Wtf poison proteins and how the Wtf antidote proteins rescue that
toxicity. Analogous to other drive systems, the wtf genes are flanked by short repetitive DNA sequences
(transposon-derived repeats or 5S rDNA genes). The proposed work will test the idea that the repeats flanking
wtf genes affect their evolution by promoting non-allelic gene conversion. Finally, the proposed research
program will explore the evolutionary impact of the wtf genes on the flanking 5S rDNA genes. Specifically, we
will test the hypothesis that the wtf drivers have promoted the maintenance of deleterious versions of the 5S
rDNA genes, which encode an essential component of ribosomes. This research program will greatly expand
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and molecular evolution of meiotic drive systems. This
knowledge will help guide the search for and the molecular characterization of meiotic drivers in more complex
systems, including humans. More broadly, this work will expand our understanding of DNA parasites and how
they can directly and indirectly impact health, particularly infertility. This expanded understanding should
ultimately lead to improved reproductive outcomes in humans."

Malignant melanoma has an unusually high propensity to metastasize to the brain; among stage IV patients
40-50% will develop clinically detectable intracranial disease, while on autopsy brain metastases can be
detected in over 70% of patients. Additionally, melanoma brain metastases are a marker of poor prognosis and
despite improvements with systemic targeted therapies and immunotherapies, intracranial control still remains
a significant challenge. In the brain microenvironment, melanoma cells are found predominantly in a
perivascular niche where they “co-opt” the vasculature to support their survival and invasion deep into the
cortex. While this vascular co-optive growth pattern has been associated with poor survival in melanoma
metastasis, vascular-mediated mechanisms are poorly understood and represents a unique opportunity to
target the cohesive interactions between melanoma cells and the endothelium to prevent or treat brain
metastases. My preliminary data has uncovered a vascular-mediated induction of transforming growth factor
beta (TGFβ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) in melanoma cells after contact with
brain endothelial cells. Additionally, this TGFβ-PDGFRβ signaling axis can activate the downstream PI3K/AKT
pathway, which has sustained activation when the tumor suppressor phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) is
lost. PI3K/AKT activation or loss of PTEN has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma brain
metastases but has not been explored in the context of vascular-mediated survival or invasion. Thus, in my
proposal I hypothesize that vascular-mediated induction of TGFβ-PDGFRβ signaling in concert with
PTEN loss is important for melanoma cell invasion and survival in the brain microenvironment.
Throughout my proposal, I will generate and utilize isogenic lines with alterations in TGFβ, PDGFRβ, or PTEN
(or combinations of alterations) and will study their effects on migration and apoptosis through a variety of in

will reveal a novel vascular-derived role for TGFβ, PDGFRβ, and PTEN in melanoma brain metastasis; this will
provide crucial insights and rationale for the development of therapeutics that disrupt cohesive interactions with
the brain endothelium and exploit the survival advantages of the perivascular brain niche. To complete my

10763845,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality.
In atrial cardiomyocytes, excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling is initiated by activation of voltage-gated Na+
channels, NaV1.5. Depolarization of the membrane potential, by Na+ channels, leads to activation of voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels, thereby triggering Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in atria cardiomyocytes. During the prior
funding period, we developed innovative methods to probe determinants triggering persistent Na+ current-
induced spontaneous AF in mice. We identified heterogeneously prolonged action potential duration, abnormal
Ca2+ handling, increased reactive oxygen species and oxidation of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) as drivers of
atrial cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. In this renewal, we will expand these studies, now applying innovative
proximity labeling, novel mouse models, and groundbreaking atomic resolution structural studies of the human
recombinant RyR2 channel. Three Aims are proposed: (1) Determine the role of adrenergic regulation of Ca2+
channels in atrial E-C coupling and arrhythmogenesis. Recently, we identified the mechanism by which β-
adrenergic agonists stimulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We observed that the Ca2+ channel inhibitor Rad, a
monomeric G-protein, is enriched in the CaV1.2 micro-environment but is depleted during β-adrenergic
stimulation. PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of specific residues on Rad relieves constitutive inhibition of CaV1.2.
To determine the role of PKA-induced stimulation of Ca2+ currents in the atria, we will use knock-in mice with the
four PKA phosphorylation sites of Rad mutated to alanine, mice lacking the Rad-β subunit interaction as well
mice expressing RyR2 channels that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA. Using these mice, we will determine
whether phosphorylation of Rad and/or phosphorylation of RyR2 are required for adrenergic agonist-induced
AF. (2) To define the atrial NaV1.5, CaV1.2 and RyR2 interactomes and “neighborhoods” in atrial cardiomyocytes
under physiological and pathological conditions. We propose to use proximity labeling approaches to compare
the neighborhoods of Ca2+, Na+ and RyR2 channels in the atria, and determine how these neighborhoods change
in pathological conditions, such as HF, which predisposes patients to AF. (3) To elucidate the role of oxidation
of RyR2 in the pathogenesis of AF. We speculate that oxidation of RyR2 and the resultant SR Ca2+ leak is an
essential downstream effector leading to atrial arrhythmias. We will identify which cysteine residues are oxidized
in atrial RyR2 in both mice and humans with AF. The structural effects of the identified oxidized cysteine residues
will be investigated using an atomic-resolution structure of human recombinant RyR2 determined by cryo-EM,
and by electrophysiological studies of heterologously expressed mutant RyR2 channels. Taken together, these
highly innovative and novel studies will elucidate the intersecting signaling pathways that affect atrial
cardiomyocyte contraction and arrhythmogenesis, and hopefully lead to the development of new therapeutics."
10780182,"Cytokines govern key cellular processes of pregnancy with both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. To prevent
immune dysregulation at the maternal-fetal interface, cytokines are thought to dictate these seemingly
contradictory immune responses through meticulous immune regulation. Yet, there is a gap in knowledge
regarding the mechanistic roles of many cytokines in the context of pregnancy, including the versatile cytokine
Interleukin 27 (IL-27). Our proposal will address this gap in knowledge, as we have recently established that the
IL-27 signaling circuit is active at the maternal-fetal interface and discovered that IL-27 is a protective cytokine
during congenital infection. IL-27 serves as a potent regulatory of inflammation, where it can be pro- or anti-
inflammatory dependent upon cellular context. Although initially recognized for its proinflammatory activities in
promoting immunity, IL-27 was later acknowledged for its profound ability to serve as an anti-inflammatory
cytokine during various infections where IL-27 has been found to act on various T subsets cells to limit
inflammation during infection. Moreover, IL-27 can directly influence viral infection through induction of antiviral
genes in IL-27 responsive cells. Based on literature and our extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-
27 is both an immunoregulatory and antiviral cytokine during pregnancy. This proposal describes targeted
objectives to define the mechanistic features of IL-27 signaling at the maternal-fetal interface that underlie its
protective capacity during congenital infection. In Aim 1 we will focus our investigations on defining the immune
regulatory functions of IL-27 at the maternal-fetal interface. We will uncover the cellular targets and impacts of
IL-27 signaling in dictating activation state of localized T cells. In Aim 2 we will focus our studies on the antiviral
functions of IL-27 in the placenta. We will evaluate the transcriptional dynamics of IL-27 signaling and antiviral
capacity of IL-27 signaling in mouse and human placental trophoblast organoids. Altogether, outcomes from this
proposal will embody new fundamental insights into regulatory cytokine communication at the maternal-fetal
interface. Specifically, this proposal will define the mechanisms underlying IL-27 protective immunity during
congenital infection, which could ultimately be leveraged to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes."
10764151,"Project Summary
Maintaining epithelial homeostasis is crucial for organismal health since its disruption is linked to multiple
human diseases, such as cancers. Cells elicit many behaviors to maintain the structure and function of
epithelia during normal homeostasis and stress. Comprehending their behavior is essential for promoting our
knowledge of how to keep epithelia healthy. We propose to take advantage of the robustness of the Drosophila
intestinal system to gain new insights into complex cell behaviors that remain understudied. Our R35-funded
research concerns `cell extrusion', a process that removes unnecessary, defective, or potentially harmful cells
from epithelia without disrupting its barrier function. Over the past five years, we established the Drosophila
intestine as a new model for studying how intestinal epithelial cells expressing an oncogenic Ras (RasV12) are
eliminated apically and basally from the intestinal epithelium. We have identified multiple new players in the
process and provided new concepts to the field. Moreover, our study resulted in two new observations: 1)
Drosophila macrophage-like immune cells hemocytes infiltrate into the intestinal epithelium and elicit complex
cell behaviors under stress, and 2) intestinal epithelial cells generate long-range projections, resembling
`airinimes'—structures that mediate long-distance signaling during pigment development in zebrafish. These
cell behaviors are documented in multiple model systems; however, their physiological significance and
underlying molecular mechanisms require additional investigation. Our observations bring an exciting
opportunity to leverage the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to understand the roles of these cell
behaviors in a native context and identify new players in these processes. Thus, we propose to expand our
research scope to include these additional complex cell behaviors. Continuing our work on cell extrusion, we
will focus on addressing what drives the elimination of RasV12-expressing intestinal epithelial cells from the
intestine. Regarding the behavior of hemocytes, we propose to investigate how hemocyte-mediated cell
behaviors contribute to the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium structure and function during normal
homeostasis and under stress. Lastly, we will study what signaling is mediated by the long-range projections
and what roles they play in the maintenance of intestinal epithelium. The overarching goal is to increase our
general understanding of complex cell behaviors underlying epithelial homeostasis by elucidating their
biological significance and discovering their molecular mechanisms. These proposed studies will help us to
learn the principles that keep epithelia healthy and prevent diseases associated with abnormalities in epithelial
homeostasis."
10765737,"Endosomal dysfunction is a well-accepted cell biological feature in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However,
biomarkers reflecting endosomal traffic defects are still lacking. Current imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
AD biomarkers focus primarily on the histopathology of the disease—that is, biomarkers that are linked to
neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. This proposal is designed to expand this focus to develop
biomarkers of the ‘cell biology’ of AD. Such biomarkers could potentially accelerate drug discovery, as
therapeutic interventions are currently being developed that target endosomal trafficking defects in AD.
 Genetic and cell biology studies have previously linked the endosomal trafficking assembly Retromer to
AD pathology. Most notable are deficiencies and rare mutations in retromer’s core protein, VPS35, and
retromer’s receptor, SORL1. Depletion of either VPS35 or SORL1 mimics the core cytopathology in AD, enlarged
endosomes in neurons, with concomitant mis-trafficking of endosomal cargoes.
In an effort to characterize defects in the endocytic pathway resulting from retromer dysfunction, we recently
completed a proteomic screen of CSF of VPS35 knock-out (KO) mice and control littermates. Among the proteins found elevated in the CSF of VPS35 KO mice were well established β-secretase BACE1 substrates, includingAPP (Amyloid Precursor Protein); APLP1/2 (Amyloid Beta Precursor Like Proteins 1 and 2); and CHL1 (Neuralcell adhesion molecule L1-like protein). Two of these proteins --APLP1 and CHL1-- were further validated inmouse CSF, and human CSF from cognitively healthy participants and prodromal AD patients. Collectively, our studies suggest BACE1 substrates as potential biomarkers of retromer-dependent endosomal dysfunction.
However, since VPS35 is implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD),
these new biomarkers may not be specific to AD. Therefore, relying on these exciting findings, but moving
towards the development of a panel of biomarkers reflecting endosomal trafficking defects that are specific to
AD, we will examine SORL1 mouse models and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) SORL1-derived neurons
as a new source of biomarkers of endosomal trafficking. We will also investigate exosomes as an additional
source of biomarkers of endosomal defects. Lastly, since Sorl1 protein levels are altered in AD and CSF from
AD patients, we will examine SORL1 CSF levels as a potential biomarker for AD. Completion of this study will
provide evidence that SORL1-dependent endosomal trafficking is a new source of biomarkers for AD.
Moreover, we predict that the extensive studies here proposed will identify a unique and specific
endosomal biomarker of the “cell biology” of AD."
10765605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 According to the most recent U.S. Census, the elderly population will more than double to 80 million,
encompassing 1 in 5 Americans by 2050. Aging is characterized by a decline in tissue function and regenerative
capacity. Sarcopenia, also known as age-dependent loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, is a major public-
health problem that affects 15% of the elderly, leading to loss of mobility and diminished quality of life. Age-
related muscle loss is paralleled by a loss in the function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs), key players in muscle
homeostasis and regeneration. However, the mechanisms responsible for age-associated MuSC dysfunction
remain elusive. Two major barriers to gaining mechanistic insights into MuSC aging are (1) the heterogeneity of
the aged MuSC population, which renders standard bulk analysis ineffective, and (2) the lack of tools to resolve
this heterogeneity, underscoring the need for single-cell studies.
 We previously demonstrated that aged MuSCs are a heterogeneous population comprised of functional
and dysfunctional subsets. This key observation suggests a therapeutic strategy to regenerate muscle - boosting
the activity of resilient functional MuSCs. Here we explore this possibility using a specific cell surface marker
and a series of innovative single-cell technologies required to resolve MuSC subsets. Our preliminary data iden-
tify CD47 as a cell surface marker whose expression level, not presence or absence, distinguishes functional
CD47lo and dysfunctional CD47hi MuSC subsets. Known widely as a receptor for SIRPα, CD47 is also a receptor
for thrombospondin-1 (THBS1). We found that CD47hi MuSCs accumulate in aged muscle and aberrantly ex-
press THBS1. We hypothesize that during aging the accumulation of CD47hi MuSCs impairs the proliferation of
CD47lo MuSCs through secretion of THBS1, hindering regeneration and contributing to sarcopenia. Here, our
specific aims are to (1) determine how CD47 signaling goes awry in aging, (2) elucidate how post-transcriptional
regulation of CD47 is altered during aging leading to the accumulation of dysfunctional CD47hi MuSCs, and (3)
determine the effects of aberrant THBS1 secretion in the aged MuSC niche on regeneration. We capitalize on
cutting-edge single-cell technologies, including multidimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) and multi-
plexed tissue imaging (CO-Detection by indexing (CODEX)). These technologies allow us to track simultane-
ously 40+ distinct cell and signaling phenotypes in CD47lo and CD47hi MuSCs (CyTOF) and resolve how spatial
changes in the architecture of the multicellular niche lead to MuSC dysfunction in aging (CODEX). We combine
this knowledge with in vivo investigation of regenerative capacity and strength in aged mice. Finally, we perturb
CD47 signaling in vivo using blocking antibodies to surmount the regenerative deficits in aged mice. The pro-
posed analyses of newly identified aged MuSC subsets that can be prospectively isolated will provide fresh
mechanistic insights into aging and inform therapeutic strategies to augment endogenous muscle repair."
10765746,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Impaired skeletal muscle regeneration and associated pathological tissue remodeling (loss of muscle, gain of
fibrotic and adipose tissues) following injury underlie functional and metabolic decline—hallmarks of aging.
Regeneration is dependent on a well-orchestrated myogenic program that includes the activation and expansion
of skeletal muscle stem cells/progenitor cells (MPCs) and terminal differentiation of MPCs into mature
multinucleated muscle cells. We previously demonstrated that MPCs rely on extracellular availability of the
nutritionally, non-essential amino acids L-serine (Ser) and glycine (Gly). Decreased availability of Ser/Gly impairs
MPC expansion, induces intramuscular adipocytes following injury, and induces toxic deoxysphingolipid
accumulation in the muscle. Further, we demonstrated that endogenous Ser/Gly levels decline with age. The
metabolic product (i.e. requirement) of Ser/Gly for MPC expansion and the efficacy of dietary Ser/Gly for muscle
regeneration and the cell (MPC)-extrinsic environment need to be resolved. We propose to use isotope tracing
of Ser and Gly to define the metabolic requirement of Ser/Gly for MPC population expansion. Further, using
models that we have demonstrated reduce (depleted diet) or enhance (supplemented diet) endogenous Ser/Gly
levels, we will quantify the effects of Ser/Gly availability on age- and injury-related muscle regeneration and the
cell (MPC)-extrinsic muscle environment. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that MPCs require
glutathione synthesis, from extracellular Ser and Gly, to mitigate oxidative stress. Additionally, we hypothesize
that diet-induced reduction of endogenous Ser/Gly exacerbates age-related (i) impairments in muscle
regeneration and (ii) toxic non-canonical sphingolipids in the cell-extrinsic muscle environment. Further, we
expect Ser/Gly supplementation will counter these effects. To capture the efficacy of dietary Ser/Gly to modulate
age-related impairments in muscle regeneration and remodeling we will use novel sphingolipidome profiling and
transcriptomics. Successful completion of this project will transform the fundamental understanding of the
metabolic essentiality of Ser and Gly for skeletal muscle regeneration and the relationship of this loss to age-
related muscle deterioration. The results will enable testable scientifically grounded therapies to improve the
regenerative capacity in populations that have impaired muscle regeneration, such as older adults."

The global objective of the Personalizing EmerGency/Acute therapeuticS Utilizing Systems biology
(PEGASUS-2) Research Program is to improve drug effectiveness and safety in common acute care conditions.
Drug therapy for acute conditions in the emergency department is only effective in approximately 50% of cases.
There is tremendous opportunity to improve acute therapeutics by implementing precision medicine programs
in acute care settings. We will build on the progress of PEGAUS-1 through 1) expand our multi-omic analyses
in our target drug classes, 2) expand our statistical analytic methods to include multi-omic, machine learning
analyses, and polygenic risk scores, and 3) expand to new sites in order to validate our findings. We will leverage
our robust emergency medicine specimen bank (EMSB), the only acute care biorepository that focuses all
patients presenting with acute illness, and we will continue to use phenotypic data from our electronic health
record linking these data to pharmacogenomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data to discover new
mechanisms of drug effectiveness and safety. Ultimately clinical and `omic data are integrated into multi-omic
models to improve therapeutic success in acutely ill patients. Through the Maximizing Investigators' Research
Award (MIRA) funding, PEGASUS-2 will continue to focus on common acute care conditions such as nausea,
pain, and cardiovascular disease. In the future, these models will be tested prospectively. PEGASUS-1 has
already identified numerous genetic and metabolic polymorphisms associated with drug effectiveness and
expansion of the program will serve to increase our understanding of these mechanisms and improve the
treatment of acute conditions."
10765274,"ABSTRACT
Current approaches to small molecule drug discovery are slow, expensive, and prone to failure. The abundance
of data for structural biology has led to the emergence of a variety of computer-aided drug discovery
methodologies aiming to leverage this structural data to predict compound affinities to prioritize compounds
for synthesis in the pursuit of potency. Alchemical free energy methods, which use rigorous statistical
mechanics to predict the free energy of binding, have led the way in providing useful predictions for improving
or maintaining potency in hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases of structure-enabled programs. Numerous
offerings---such as Schrödinger FEP+, Orion NES, CCG AMBER-TI, and the Open Force Field Consortium have
emerged that provide engineered solutions with widespread industry adoption for structure-enabled discovery,
integrating advances from academia that my lab has been fortunate to contribute to over the last 15 years.
In contrast to physical methods such as alchemical free energy calculations, the emergence of machine learning
models based on deep learning architectures has provided a complementary tool for computer-aided drug
discovery. While physical models can generalize broadly across properties of interest for many target proteins,
they lack the ability to easily learn from data generated for a discovery program. Machine learning methods, on
the other hand, can readily learn from data, but often lack the ability to predict target-specific properties due to
their need for large training sets, generally limiting their utility to properties of relevance to drug discovery that
do not depend on the target, like ADMET properties.
This proposal builds on our highly successful work in alchemical free energy calculations by proposing a new
generation of hybrid physical / machine learning models that overcome the limitations of each method on its
own: By endowing alchemical free energy calculations with the ability to learn at multiple scales, we aim to
bring these tools into the next decade. Building on our extensive history of innovation in alchemical free energy
calculations for drug discovery, we will (1) significantly increase their accuracy via the integration of ML
potentials; (2) expand their domain of applicability beyond affinity to encompass conformational and target
selectivity, resistance, interactions with structurally-enabled toxicity targets, and physical properties like
membrane permeability, lipophilicity, and solubility; (3) eliminate accuracy-limiting challenges associated with
current calculations such as sampling of protonation and tautomeric states, structured waters, and ions; (4)
introduce learnability into every aspect of alchemical free energy calculations to enable predictions to become
systematically more accurate as project data is collected and greatly reduce the cost of evaluating very large
virtual synthetic spaces with alchemical-like accuracy; and (5) cast alchemical predictions in a Bayesian
framework to enable the propagation of uncertainties in the underlying models into predicted affinities,
selectivities, and other properties."
10765275,"SUMMARY
The field of structural biology is experiencing transformative change. New experimental and computational tools
are revealing a remarkable catalogue of structures with unprecedented speed. In addition to the thousands of
determined structures and the millions of new structure predictions, novel protein designs are emerging in a
flurry facilitated by a host of new machine learning approaches. In the face of all this, important gaps remain that
limit our fundamental understanding of protein structure and function, and our ability to rapidly visualize atomic
molecular structures. These gaps persist where conventional approaches have been traditionally stalled, for
example in the characterization of large, multimeric protein complexes, unknown chemical entities and dynamic
assemblies. The amyloid fold is a notable example of such a challenging area, given its long lack of atomic
resolution structures and viable therapeutics, as well as its emerging yet enigmatic role in benign physiological
processes such as phase separation by low complexity sequences. The Rodriguez lab has been at the forefront
of efforts to uncover complex amyloid structures with remarkable detail, facilitated in part by an ESI MIRA (R35
GM128867) award. That award also funded critical developments that brought to life new methods for structure
determination via MicroED. However, despite the promise of these methods, the single isolated structures they
have revealed in remarkable detail have lacked context and represent only a small part of the structural path
from single molecule to fibril. The current proposal, a renewal of R35 GM128867, builds on that successful five
year effort to characterize toxic and infectious assemblies at the atomic level and envisions three directions for
an improved structural understanding of protein assemblies: We now propose to 1. Further the development of
new tools for more accurate and rapid determination of molecular and cellular structures. 2. Advance our
fundamental understanding of highly pleiomorphic molecules, particularly those that are prone to forming large-
scale multimeric assemblies through amyloid-like interactions, in functional or pathogenic roles. 3. Chart
sequence-function relationships that allow proteins to give rise to and/or facilitate pathogenic traits through
allosteric or epistatic networks of residue level changes, particularly in acutely lethal agents. These directions
continue to elaborate rigorous approaches to molecular structure determination, while leveraging the
compendium of emerging tools for structure prediction and discovery. Hybrid approaches allow us to take on the
more ambitious challenges of charting the function of pathogenic and functional amyloids in situ, and to chart
vast functional sequence landscapes in dynamic multiprotein assemblies. Collectively, the efforts bring us closer
to the ideal of witnessing atomic structures in context and uncovering the basis for molecular processes that
underpin complex physiological and pathological events."

 The long-term goal of my research is to understand how the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of
enzymes maintain metabolic homeostasis. The function of metabolic homeostasis is to maintain appropriate
levels of ATP and biosynthetic precursors. Understanding metabolic homeostasis is important as it is a
fundamental property of all cells and its dysregulation leads to metabolic syndrome, which contributes to several
common disorders, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Metabolic homeostasis is achieved by controlling enzyme activity through mass action and allosteric regulation.
Studies of purified enzymes have yielded extensive knowledge of the structure, reaction mechanism, and
allosteric regulation of enzymes in several metabolic pathways. However, metabolic homeostasis is the result of
non-linear interactions between many enzymes and metabolites, which are difficult to fully understand by
studying individual enzymes in isolation. As a result, the specific functions of most allosteric regulators is not well
understood and it is largely unknown how allosteric regulation and mass action achieve metabolic homeostasis
in cells. In this proposal, our main objectives are to 1) develop mathematical models to characterize metabolic
homeostasis, and 2) develop experimental approaches to test model predictions by measuring and manipulating
metabolic homeostasis in live cells and in vitro reconstituted pathways. We will use a combination of modeling
and experiments to address key gaps in our understanding of the regulation of glycolysis, pentose phosphate
pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The big-picture questions that we
plan to investigate are: How do glycolysis and respiration maintain cellular ATP homeostasis? How do cells
resolve the conflicting demands of ATP production and biosynthesis? How do metabolic pathways that share
products and substrates coordinate with each other? What is the role of compartmentalization and metabolite
channeling in regulating metabolic homeostasis? Our lab is well-positioned to make advances in the
understanding of metabolic homeostasis as we have extensive experience in developing and using LC-MS,
fluorescence sensors, genetically-encoded tools for manipulation of metabolism, in vitro protein characterization,
engineering cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9, and mathematical models to study metabolism."
10765564,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epithelia are the core cell type of animals, and constitute the most widespread and ancient mode of tissue
architecture. My lab uses a distinctive set of multidisciplinary strategies to study fundamental questions of
epithelial biology using Drosophila, leveraging deep evolutionary conservation to uncover general principles
applicable across phylogeny. The research proposed in this MIRA renewal tackles basic mechanisms underlying
epithelial organ shaping and the total body’s response to epithelial injury. Both goals -- one in which we have a
long track record and another stimulated by discoveries during the previous funding period-- build on my
laboratory’s 20-year NIGMS-funded research program.
In one direction we will investigate how developing epithelia respond not just to intracellular forces, but also to
resistance from the extracellular matrix. This understudied question is central to the morphogenetic movements
that allow organs to attain the specific forms required for function. Our previous work has shown how an organ
can be sculpted by finely patterned mechanical properties of the basement membrane that underlies all epithelia.
We will determine the mechanisms that regulate conserved matrix components and modifiers to achieve precise
mechanical patterning, and then exploit this knowledge to manipulate tissue shape in a predictable fashion.
In the other direction, we will explore the whole-body response to epithelial barrier damage. While the local
wound response is well-characterized and conserved across many phyla, animals also have systemic wound
responses mediated by signaling factors that communicate with distant organs. The mechanisms and impact of
these humoral responses, which include but are not limited to inflammation, are poorly understood compared to
the antimicrobial immune response triggered in parallel; they may include unappreciated signaling molecules
and exotic forms of signal transmission alongside well-known pathways such as TNF. Leveraging the strengths
of Drosophila for discovery biology, we will induce sterile injury in adult epithelial tissues and identify signaling
axes that communicate between the organ of insult and responding tissues to promote homeostasis and health.
This goal will include a comprehensive analysis of TNF signaling in the adult, and investigation of differences
between normal tissue repair and that triggered by chronic inflammation.
The proposed experiments tackle these key questions by combining the traditional strengths of Drosophila
genetics with advanced imaging and new biochemical techniques, empowered by collaborations. Our results
will enhance understanding of conserved mechanisms that generate functional epithelial organs during
development, and lay the foundation for addressing disorders driven by epithelial damage and pathology."

 Interstitial fibrosis is a common finding on kidney biopsy, and strongly predicts future decline in kidney function
irrespective of the underlying etiology of kidney disease. Unfortunately, interstitial fibrosis is poorly captured by
the current clinical biomarkers of kidney function (eGFR and albuminuria). Thus, interstitial fibrosis is common,
holds substantial prognostic importance, and yet clinicians are blind to its presence or severity except in rare
instances when kidney biopsies are performed. Concurrently, new drugs are being tested to limit kidney
interstitial fibrosis, but there are no non-invasive methods to assess changes in fibrosis over time. Interstitial
fibrosis is currently estimated from histopathological examination of a kidney biopsy, which are rarely done. A
non-invasive test to estimate interstitial fibrosis is not currently available. Our exciting preliminary data
demonstrated that use of routine ultrasonography (USG) of the kidney, interpreted by deep learning/artificial
intelligence can non-invasively assess the presence and severity of interstitial fibrosis. The overarching goal of
this study is to further develop, and internally and externally validate a deep learning-based algorithm to estimate
interstitial fibrosis from USG images of the kidney relative to the kidney biopsy gold standard. We hypothesize
that, embedded within a kidney USG image are interstitial fibrosis corelates that can be extracted by deep
learning and quantitatively analyzed to estimate interstitial fibrosis with high precision, and will improve prediction
of longitudinal decline in kidney function. If so, given the widespread availability of kidney USG world-wide, this
non-invasive estimate of interstitial fibrosis would have immediate clinical implications with improved
prognostication, and ability to serially monitor interstitial fibrosis in response to therapy. The proposed program
of research will address three specific aims: Aim 1. To further develop and internally validate a deep learning-
based system for interstitial fibrosis quantification from kidney USG image. In Aim 2, we will externally validate
the performance of the deep learning model using an independent cohort of USG images and kidney biopsies,
and evaluate performance across strata of age, gender, and body size. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine if the
USG deep learning-based interstitial fibrosis score is associated with kidney disease progression with similar
strengths relative to kidney biopsy assessment of interstitial fibrosis. Upon completion of this program of
research, we envision development of an app. / plug-in for ultrasound reading modules that would facilitate
widespread dissemination of the deep-learning tool, such that USG-based fibrosis scoring is widely available to
treating clinicians."

The triad of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects roughly 33% of U.S. adults
and raises the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The epidemiological association of obesity with T2DM
is unequivocal, but mechanistic links remain unclear. However, it is clear T2DM is distinctly associated with
defective fat cell (adipocyte) function, particularly energy storage as lipids and secretion of hormones for
systemic insulin sensitivity. We discovered the expression of the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) in white
adipose tissue (WAT) correlates with insulin sensitivity in obese subjects. ASPA governs intracellular acetate
generation and myelin formation in the brain, but its effect in other tissues remains unknown. This
application's overall scientific objective is to unravel how ASPA and acetate contribute to lipid substrates in WAT
using well-established in vitro tools and mouse models of obesity. The central hypothesis is that ASPA-derived
acetate promotes adipocyte differentiation and systemic energy balance. I will test this hypothesis by pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Demonstrate how altered ASPA expression affects lipogenesis in white adipocytes;
2) Define the impact of extracellular acetate on adipogenic competency of precursor cells; 3) Establish the
metabolic effects of ASPA disruption in vivo. Mature adipocytes express high ASPA levels and byproducts of
ASPA activity flow into lipogenesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, and histone modifications. Therefore, ASPA function
likely integrates multiple pathways necessary for adipocytes to overcome nutrient demands in obesity. Lastly,
the mentor and training environment will build research and career development skills to realize my ultimate goal
of becoming an independent scientist."

The inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-17, has emerged as a major player in inflammation-associated,
spontaneous, and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) models, as well as human CRC. In fact, elevated IL-17
has been negatively correlated with CRC patient survival, and even linked to resistance to both chemotherapy
and targeted therapeutics. However, master regulatory mechanisms that control IL-17-IL-17R signaling in CRC
remain largely unknown. Key Findings: We recently uncovered a critical role for the microRNA, miR-146a, in
preventing colonic inflammation and associated tumorigenesis. Mice deficient in miR-146a (-/-) are highly
susceptible to both colitis-associated and spontaneous CRC, which appears to be mediated by enhanced
tumorigenic IL-17-IL17R signaling. Mechanistically, our data suggest miR-146a limits intestinal inflammation and
CRC by two interlinked mechanisms: 1) miR-146a within myeloid cells inhibits IL-17-inducing cytokines, which
restricts IL-17 production; and 2) miR-146a within intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) inhibits tumorigenic IL-17R
signaling, which restricts IL-17 responsiveness. Within myeloid cells, miR-146a binds RIPK2, an NOD2 signaling
intermediate, to limit myeloid cell-derived IL-17-inducing cytokines, such as IL-23, and restrict colonic IL-17
levels. Accordingly, myeloid cell-specific deletion of miR-146a leads to CRC susceptibility. In addition to inhibiting
IL-17, miR-146a directly limits tumorigenic IL-17R signaling within IECs by binding TRAF6. Correspondingly,
IEC-specific deletion of miR-146a also confers CRC susceptibility. Importantly, preclinical administration of miR-
146a mimic can ameliorate CRC. Finally, we show that miR-146a appears to analogously target RIPK2 and
TRAF6 in humans, including in CRC patients, suggesting miR-146a may also limit IL-17-IL-17R signaling in
humans to control CRC. Hypothesis/Goal: We will test our hypothesis that miR-146a protects against CRC by
regulating colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis in mice and humans. In Aim 1, we will leverage IEC-specific
miR-146a-/- mice, IEC progenitor-specific miR-146a-/- mice, ApcMin/+miR-146a-/- mice, ApcMin/+miR-146a-/-KrasLSL-
G12D mice, miR-146a-silenced/overexpressing human IECs, and CRC patient samples to test if miR-146a within
IECs targets TRAF6 and inhibits IL-17R-mediated tumorigenesis in mice and humans. In Aim 2, we will leverage
myeloid cell-specific miR-146a-/- mice, ApcMin/+miR-146a-/- mice and ApcMin/+miR-146a-/-KrasLSL-G12D mice, miR-
146a-silenced/overexpressing human primary myeloid cells, and CRC patient samples to test if miR-146a within
myeloid cells targets RIPK2, where it inhibits NOD2 signaling and IL-17-inducing cytokines, ultimately restricting
IL-17 production and CRC in mice and humans. In Aim 3, we will leverage inflammation-associated CRC,
spontaneous CRC, and CRC metastasis models to test if miR-146a mimic therapeutically inhibits
tumor/chemoresistance-promoting IL-17 pathways, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In
summary, miR-146a is of unique significance because it constitutes a single target that modulates multiple
pathways converging on tumorigenic IL-17 signaling and may offer novel therapeutic points of intervention."

Pancreatic islet dysfunction is a signature feature in the pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes and can stem from
developmental adaptations to placental insufficiency (PI) and fetal growth restriction (FGR). We have identified
significant reductions in insulin production and secretion that persist in offspring with FGR. Our efforts to elucidate
programming mechanisms in FGR islets indicate that reductions in normal, constitutive nuclear factor kappa B
(NFκB) activity negatively affects insulin secretion. Additionally, our preliminary findings associate depressed
NFκB activity with hypoxia-induced MALAT1 expression because this long intergenic non-coding (linc) RNA
binds NFκB to prevent activation. The guiding premise of this project is that low fetal oxygen and glucose
concentrations from PI cause β-cell dysfunction during development. Therefore, we plan to correct oxygen and
glucose concentrations in FGR fetuses during PI and show improvements in insulin secretion and β-cell
proliferation. Foundational experiments demonstrate that combined supplementation of oxygen and glucose to
the fetus with PI-induced FGR improves insulin secretion, but the underlying cues that cause persistent β-cell
failure are undiscovered. We hypothesize that correction of oxygen and glucose concentrations in the PI-FGR
fetus to normal, control fetal values will prevent β-cell dysfunction by enhancing β-cell proliferation and insulin
secretion through the restoration of constitutive and physiological NFκB activity. Furthermore, fetal oxygen and
glucose correction will resolve programmed deficiencies in β-cells of FGR lambs. We have adapted our fetal
sheep model of PI-FGR to test a supplemental mixture of oxygen and glucose in a controlled, in utero
environment. Preliminary experiments with five days of oxygen and glucose correction lowered norepinephrine,
increased insulin, and restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in islets, demonstrating its suitability
as a model to test whether the capacity to reverse PI ameliorates β-cell failure. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the
combined effect of oxygen and glucose correction to improve β-cell function in fetuses and neonates with PI-
induced FGR. In Aim 2, we will determine limitations in GSIS that result from lower constitutive NFκB activity due
to MALAT1 overexpression in FGR islets. By alleviating hypoxemia and providing glucose, a major nutrient for
β-cell responsiveness, we expect that insulin secretion and β-cell proliferation will increase and programming
mechanisms causing β-cell dysfunction will return to normal. Impact of these experiments will be high, as they
will provide fundamental new knowledge about the reversibility of β-cell dysfunction in fetuses with PI-induced
FGR. In addition, our experiments will define the unique roles for NFκB regulation in β-cells from FGR fetuses
that cause developmental adaptations that persistently lower insulin secretion. We also will gain new insight on
the reversibility of a distinct islet-programming mechanism when fetal oxygen and glucose is corrected, which is
expected to improved short- and long-term outcomes in individuals with FGR."

Lung diseases exhibit differences between males and females in risk, progression, symptoms,
and response to therapy; rigorous investigation is needed to define the molecular reasons for
these differences. Our previous work has demonstrated that modeling Omics data using gene
regulatory networks can discover key differences driving health and disease. The goal of this K24
is to merge our prior approach to modeling sex differences with mentoring researchers in sex-
and gender-aware data science. Methods will support modelling gender and sex as a
biologic variable using a data science framework, to promote translation of data from the
NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine(TOPMed) program to actionable clinical
innovations for COPD. The goal of this Patient Oriented Research program is to mentor trainees
in Omics data science and Network Medicine through a sex and gender lens, which requires not
only considering biology(sex) but societal constructs(gender); to date this approach has been
limited for lung diseases. To advance the dissemination of data analytic approaches for COPD
research, we will focus on sex and gender aware epidemiology, Omic analyses inclusive of X and
Y chromosome data, and gene regulatory network methods. In addition to mentoring and career
development, trainees will pursue the hypothesis that somatic mosaicism on the X chromosome
(mCA X) and loss of Y (LoY) will associate with COPD phenotypes and COPD progression. To
facilitate mentoring, scientific Aims include 1) Investigating whether mCA X and LoY mediate sex
and gender divergent features of COPD and 2) Defining pathway and gene regulatory network
rewiring associated with mCA X and LoY, using single Omic and network-based approaches.
Innovative aspects include the evaluation of gender as well as sex associations with COPD;
investigation of mCA X and LoY and COPD; extension of gene regulatory network approaches to
include somatic mosaicism; and development of a sex- and gender-aware data science toolkit.
Understanding sex and gender differences using tools to integrate Omics and the gene regulatory
landscapes with mCA X and LoY will improve our understanding of COPD and support precision
medicine initiatives. This paradigm shifting K24 will support the training of the next generation of
pulmonary data scientists interested in sex and gender-aware Patient Oriented Research, with
specific application to COPD, a leading cause of death with sex divergent features."
10783626,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is resistant to conventional therapies, leading to poor disease-free
survival and high recurrence rates. However, in contrast to other breast cancers, TNBCs have more tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes making them a suitable target for immunotherapy. While immune checkpoint inhibitors
in combination with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other immunotherapy drugs have demonstrated
clinically relevant improvements in overall response rates for TNBC patients, response is still limited to a
subset of patients. Over the past decade, immunogenic cell death (ICD) has been recognized as an imperative
step for anti-tumor immunity. ICD is a specific cell death pathway that is induced by cellular stress, resulting in
the exposure or secretion of several damage-associated molecular patterns and cytokines which facilitate the
cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells. ICD induction has become an increasingly popular
treatment option for combination therapies with preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating that
chemotherapy can act as an ICD inducer for TNBCs. However, new ICD inducers are needed to combat
systemic toxicities and oncogenic side effects of chemotherapy. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a non-toxic,
non-ionizing, readily clinically translatable option for non-invasive, targeted tumor destruction. Immunotherapy
is an emerging application of FUS, and thermal FUS has been shown to induce release of intact tumor-
associated antigens and heat-shock proteins, an indicator of ICD, in breast cancer. However, ICD induction
after thermal FUS application has not been thoroughly characterized as a function of thermal dose. This
proposal will characterize the induction of ICD after FUS thermal treatment and investigate the mounting of
adaptive immunity in a murine TNBC tumor model. Two thermal FUS mechanisms (hyperthermia and thermal
ablation) will be evaluated in two specific aims. Aim 1 will quantify ICD induction following thermal FUS with
spatial registration of multiplex immunofluorescence to the MRI-derived thermal dose biomarker. Aim 2 will
quantify the adaptive immune response following thermal focused ultrasound induced ICD. The successful
completion of the proposal will inform how thermal focused ultrasound can influence immunogenic cell death
and subsequent adaptive immunity in a murine triple negative breast cancer model. The evaluated FUS
exposures can readily be transferred to future clinical trials as the patient-specific treatment monitoring and
MRI-based thermal dose biomarker are already utilized in ongoing FUS breast cancer clinical trials."
10786075,"The Epstein Barr virus is a DNA tumor virus that is associated with human pathologies including Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stomach cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and autoimmune diseases. EBV is particularly problematic in the HIV/AIDS population where EBV associated lymphomas are especially prevalent. While more than 90% of the world's population carries EBV, the virus typically exists in a “latent” state with little impact on the host. In response to certain stimuli or local microenvironmental cues, however, EBV enters the viral lytic replication program, leading to viral spread both within and between hosts. Despite the known role of viral latency proteins in EBV associated cancers, there are well-established links between elevated lytic replication and the onset of EBV associated cancers. Further, general elevation of EBV lytic replication is observed in the context of HIV co-infection (+ or – ART), likely contributing to the increased susceptibility of HIV infected individuals to EBV associated lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. With minimal genetic content, viruses are highly dependent on host cell resources for their replication and they elicit extensive alterations of host cell metabolic processes to facilitate efficient virus replication. One of the most conserved and well studied virus-host interactions in herpesvirus replication is “host shut off” where virus encoded factors degrade host cell RNAs destined for translation, freeing up translation resources for dedicated production of high amounts of viral structural proteins. Recently, the Glaunsinger lab showed that despite inducing global Pol III activation of host B2 SINE elements, the murine γ-herpesvirus, MHV68, inhibits host Pol II transcription as a second arm of host shut off, further promoting preferential viral protein synthesis. Using EBV reactivation models that facilitate interrogation of transcriptome changes in pure reactivating cell populations, we have gained insights into remarkable and unexpected interactions between EBV and the host cell transcriptome. Unlike MHV68, we found that EBV sustains cell Pol II gene expression at canonical promoters during lytic replication and strikingly, causes transcription at >10,000 new Pol II initiation sites across the cell genome. While the reason for the broad induction of predominantly non-coding Pol II (EBV) or Pol III (MHV68) transcription across host genomes is unclear, it could relate to some role in remodeling nuclear structure or redistribution of nuclear resources. Our studies also revealed that EBV reactivation induces widespread, noncanonical exon skipping, the extent of which surpasses the degree of exon skipping observed upon severe depletion of most spliceosome components. Preliminary analysis of KSHV reactivation similarly revealed widespread induction of exon skipping indicating that splicing disruption is not unique to EBV. Previous studies have shown that exon skipping can cause either nuclear retention or cytoplasmic nucleolytic degradation by the cellular nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway; and we show that nearly 50% of exon skipping events observed during reactivation are NMD candidates. We hypothesize that EBV (and KSHV) lytic replication induces extensive non-canonical exon skipping of cell transcripts resulting in either nuclear retention or degradation through the cytoplasmic NMD pathway as a second, new arm of host shut off. While classic host shut off has been studied for many years, how specificity for cell transcripts is achieved has been largely enigmatic. Notably, herpesviral lytic genes exhibit a remarkably consistent feature of being primarily mono-exonic (i.e. unspliced). We hypothesize that splicing derangement is a new arm of host shut off that facilitates selective targeting of spliced cell transcripts to free up resources for high-level production of viral proteins. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis, we will begin to address the mechanisms through which EBV induces splicing derangement and we will begin to address the consequences of splicing derangement on host and viral gene expression."

 Rotaviruses (RVs) are a medically important human pathogen and the predominant cause of severe
gastroenteritis, vomiting, and diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. RVs are also a great model to
interrogate the antiviral responses at the host mucosal surfaces. Our overall objectives are to better
understand RV-host interactions and to use that information to develop improved RV vaccines and therapeutic
interventions, thereby preventing and treating enteric virus infections. The host interferon (IFN) signaling
underlies the basis of RV host range restriction and suppresses the replication of RVs not native to that
species in vivo. However, the specific IFN-mediated antiviral effectors are not known and the associated
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we sought to define the most highly
induced IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in primary human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Using an IEC-specific
ISG gain-of-function screening approach, we identified several novel host factors that restrict RV replication,
including sterile alpha motif domain-containing 9 (encoded by SAMD9). Intracellular viral RNA levels and virus
progeny production were significantly enhanced in SAMD9 CRISPR knockout cells. In parallel, we also made
the exciting discovery that RV encodes non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) to target SAMD9 for proteasomal
degradation. In this R01 application, using a set of novel, powerful, and tractable model systems, we will test
the hypotheses that SAMD9 confines early RV replication in an epithelial cell-specific manner and that RV
NSP1 functions to overcome SAMD9 restriction to promote viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. In Aim 1,
we will examine the mechanistic basis underlying SAMD9 inhibition of RV replication in vitro using several
newly available fluorophore-labeled RVs and a recently developed RV reverse genetics system. We will test
these findings in a physiologically relevant human small intestinal organoid culture derived from healthy
individuals and SAMD9-mutation patients. In Aim 2, we will examine how RV NSP1 binds to SAMD9 via a
novel recognition motif and induces its degradation. We will determine whether NSP1 degrades SAMD9 in
IECs in vivo and if this process contributes to successful RV intestinal replication using a novel neonatal rat
model. Collectively, we expect these studies on SAMD9-RV interactions to have a substantial impact on
elucidating the basic biology of ISG mode of action, identifying new viral innate immune evasion mechanisms,
and laying the scientific foundation for the rational design of new RV vaccine candidates based on targeted
NSP1 attenuation."
10786081,"The discovery of frequent somatic mutations of epigenetic regulators in human cancers
has highlighted a central role of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer pathogenesis. However,
functions and mechanisms of action of these mutations remain largely unclear. The histone
methyltransferase MLL3 (also known as KMT2C) is the most frequently mutated epigenetic
regulator in breast cancer and also often altered in other major carcinomas. The majority of MLL3
mutations in breast cancer are gene deletion or protein-truncating point mutations. In addition,
MLL3 expression is downregulated in breast cancers compared to normal breast tissues,
suggesting it has a tumor suppressive role. Recent functional studies by us and others indeed
have shown that MLL3 is an important tumor suppressor in different cancers. However, the
mechanisms by which MLL3 mutations drive cancer pathogenesis remain poorly understood.
 Using novel tumor models that employ mammary stem cell (MaSC) and CRISPR
technologies, we have shown that MLL3 deletion causes stem cell expansion and drives
mammary tumorigenesis in cooperation with PI3K mutations, which significantly co-occur with
MLL3 mutations in breast cancer. Our preliminary data also found that MLL3 mutation disrupted
mammary epithelium homeostasis and induced multipotent stem cell activities in committed
epithelial cell. Furthermore, we found MLL3 deletion sensitized cells to undergo epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) in responding to various stimuli. These data suggest a role of
MLL3 mutations in promoting cell plasticity in cancer development. EMT and related cell plasticity
plays important role in cancer progression / metastasis and in therapeutic resistance. Consistently,
we found MLL3 deletion greatly promoted tumor metastasis and resistance to endocrine therapy
and PI3K inhibition in vivo.
 Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that MLL3 mutation induces epithelial cell
plasticity to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis and to confer resistance to cancer therapy.
We will determine the role of MLL3 in regulating mammary epithelial cell plasticity during tissue
homeostasis and oncogenic transformation (Aim 1), distinguish the role of MLL3
methyltransferase and adaptor functions in EMT and tumorigenesis (Aim 2), and determine the
role of cell plasticity in MLL3 mutation-caused therapeutic resistance (Aim 3)."

Globally, adolescents and young adults (AYA; ages 14-29) represent 30% of HIV incidence cases among
persons of reproductive age, with ~75% occurring in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). HIV incidence rises rapidly in
SSA, as AYA leave school (often prematurely) and migrate for work and marriage. Older adolescents are more
likely to experiment with health compromising behaviors that increase their vulnerability to HIV and sexually
transmitted infections (STIs). Young people orphaned by AIDS [YPoAIDS]), 80% of which live in SSA represent
a particularly vulnerable and unique population. Most YPoAIDS in SSA experience immense hardships, including
higher rates of HIV risk behavior and odds of HIV infection. These adversities cumulatively disrupt the
developmental milestones for YPoAIDS and can compromise their health and emotional wellbeing. Notably, our
team has had great success with implementing a 6-year, three-armed RCT that tested a family-based economic
intervention, Bridges (R01HD070727), among 1,383 primary school going adolescents in rural Uganda (10-14
years of age at enrollment) who lost one or both parents to AIDS. With over 90% retention rate over a 6-year
period (2012-2018), our findings show efficacy of this contextually-driven intervention significantly improving
sexual health, school retention and performance, and mental health. Yet, two critical policy and programming
questions related to HIV prevention and engagement in care continuum remain unaddressed: 1) longer-term
effectiveness of Bridges across YPoAIDS’s life course is currently unknown but critically important because of
unique vulnerabilities during the transition into young adulthood; and 2) self-reports of sexual health are
unreliable, hence the need to integrate biomarkers to provide the most precise results of these highly relevant
(but currently unknown) sexual health outcomes among our participants. Thus, the specific aims of the Bridges-
Round 2 study are: Aim 1. Examine the long-term impact of Bridges on: HIV prevalence (measured via
participant’s HIV status) (Primary outcome); and b) Explore in secondary analyses the long-term impact of
Bridges on key developmental and behavioral outcomes (e.g., mental health, alcohol and drug misuse); Aim 2.
Elucidate the long-term effects of Bridges on potential mechanisms of change, including: a) economic stability,
viral suppression (for ALHIV); PrEP use (for HIV negative adolescents), medical male circumcision (for boys);
and b) young adult transitions; Aim 3: Qualitatively investigate participants’ experiences with Bridges that may
have influenced engagement with the program, sexual risk-taking decisions, financial behaviors; experiences
with developmental transitions; and perceptions on program sustainability; Aim 4: To assess the long-term costs
and benefits of Bridges using formal economic evaluation. Our long-term goal is to translate knowledge into
sustainable, theoretically-guided prevention and treatment efforts that promote the wellbeing of AYA affected by
HIV/AIDS across the life course, in low-resource settings."

The use of opioids in the United States has created an opioid crisis that killed over 80,816 people in 2021. An
estimated 136 people die in the USA each day due to overdose involving an opioid. Discontinuation of opioid
use often results in severe opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS), creating a barrier to opioid cessation and OUD
treatment retention. Without adequate treatment during opioid detoxification, many patients are unable to
discontinue opioid use and stay in treatment, putting them at higher risk for opioid-related overdose. There is a
need to expand treatment options that can be used safely and effectively in the outpatient opioid detox setting
to increase treatment retention and reduce rates of opioid overdose.
Pharmacotherapies for OWS involve full-agonist treatment with methadone, partial-agonist with buprenorphine,
and alpha(2)-agonist with Lofexidine. However, in 2019, only 1.02M (14%) of the 7.6M Americans with OUD
needing treatment received pharmacotherapy treatment. There are currently FDA-cleared medical devices on
the market designed to reduce OWS, including non-invasive neurostimulation. There are currently no wearable
closed-loop devices on the market designed to monitor and treat OWS and cravings. There is a need to expand
treatment options to effective devices that provide tailored, targeted therapy by both monitoring and treating
patients with OWS to increase treatment retention and prevent relapse.
We propose the combination of physiologic sensing and neurostimulation to deliver tailored, closed-loop opioid
withdrawal treatment. Spark Biomedical has developed a wearable transcutaneous auricular neurostimulation
(tANTM) system, Sparrow Ascent. Sparrow Ascent is intended to transcutaneously stimulate branches of the
vagus and trigeminal nerves on and/or around the ear. Sparrow Ascent is based on the Sparrow Therapy
System, which was FDA-cleared in 2021 (K201873) and indicated for use as a transcutaneous nerve stimulator
that aids in the reduction or prevention of OWS. A randomized-controlled trial shows Sparrow can reduce OWS
by 46% after 60-min during acute detox. Spark partnered with Battelle Memorial Institute to integrate a closed-
loop opioid withdrawal and cravings detection algorithm with the NeuroHub platform. NeuroHub couples
wearable sensors to measure heart rate, heart rate variability, cortisol levels, accelerometry, temperature and
electrodermal activity. NeuroHub uses a cloud-based application programming interface (API) and machine
learning (ML) to create the decision tree for automated detection of OWS and cravings based on sensor feedback
to selectively trigger tAN treatment in a closed-loop system.
In this Phase I, we propose to develop an opioid withdrawal detection and cravings algorithm using
wearable physiologic sensors. The long-term goal for this algorithm is to enable patient monitoring and inform
the closed-loop delivery of tAN therapy to reduce OWS and cravings to increase treatment retention."

Fatty liver disease has emerged as a major contributing factor to the increased incidence of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in western societies in the past several years, and rates of HCC in the US are projected
to increase further in the years ahead due to over-nutrition and the obesity epidemic. Thus, an
understanding of how lipid levels in the liver are regulated and the underlying mechanistic basis of lipid
accumulation in disease states is important to developing improved ways to prevent and treat fatty liver
and HCC. The proposed research sets out to define the role of the BNIP3 and BNIP3L mitochondrial
cargo receptors in lipid metabolism in normal liver and in preventing fatty liver disease and hepatocellular
carcinoma. In the past cycle of this grant, we showed that BNIP3 is essential for mitophagy induced by
nutrient deprivation and that this in turn promotes lipid droplet turnover. Further, we showed that BNIP3-
dependent mitophagy sets up metabolic zonation in the liver through control of mitochondrial mass. We
also showed that loss of BNIP3 promoted HCC due to lipid accumulation in both mouse models of liver
cancer and in human liver, where loss of BNIP3 expression predicted HCC patient outcomes when
combined with expression levels of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. In this renewal application,
our work aims to develop further our understanding of the mechanistic basis of how BNIP3 promotes lipid
droplet turnover in concert with the turnover of mitochondria, how a second novel role for BNIP3 in
modulating the mTOR signaling pathway contributes to progression of NAFLD and NASH to HCC, and
how BNIP3 and BNIP3L (NIX) interact functionally in the liver. Specifically, in Aim 1 we seek to fully
understand the role of BNIP3 in lipid droplet turnover and liver metabolism by investigating: (1) whether
BNIP3 interacts with Rheb or other molecular partners at the lysosome and lipid droplet; and/or (2) how
the Rheb-BNIP3 interaction modulates BNIP3-LC3 interactions and mitophagy. The key objective in Aim
2 is to define how BNIP3 suppresses steatosis and HCC via modulation of mTOR pathway signaling. In
Aim 3, we propose to determine how BNIP3 and BNIP3L (NIX) differ in their role in hepatic steatosis and
how this contributes to control of steatosis, mTOR activity, tumor cell growth and liver cancer. Throughout
this renewal proposal, we make use of novel mouse models, human HCC cell lines and primary human
liver samples to explain the role of BNIP3 and BNIP3L in lipid homeostasis and growth control in the liver."
10889255,"Project Summary: Chronic inflammation and glutamate dysregulation are pathological processes that precede
and hasten brain aging and degeneration in major depression (MD). Herein, we propose the kynurenine (KYN)
pathway as a mediator of the association between inflammation and glutamate pathologies. Kynurenines are
neuroactive molecules that readily access the brain from the periphery via dedicated transporters known as
large neutral amino acid transporters (LAT-1) located in the blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain, KYN is
converted by activated microglial cells into metabolites such as quinolinic acid (QA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine
(3HK). These downstream metabolites of KYN exert robust excitotoxicity (QA) and oxidative stress (3HK) and
ultimately can lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. Extensive preclinical data and our preliminary data
indicate that the production and transfer of kynurenines into the brain from peripheral tissues is substantially
increased by biological factors such as immune activation and aging. Preclinical data also indicate that
blockade of KYN influx into the brain via competitive blockade of LAT-1 by leucine (a higher affinity ligand)
abrogates depressive-like behavior induced by immune activation in rodents. Our preliminary data in humans
indicate that peripheral KYN drives KYN metabolites in the brain, leading to increased basal ganglia glutamate,
reduced coherence of local neuronal activity, decreased functional connectivity among brain regions, and
depressive behaviors, including anhedonia and psychomotor slowing. Based on these data, we propose a 6-
week challenge paradigm in which middle-aged MD patients with increased inflammation will be randomized to
either leucine or lysine (n= 75 total). In contrast to leucine, lysine does not inhibit the influx of KYN as it uses a
different set of transporters (cationic transporters) to access the brain. We will estimate glutamate and inositol
(astroglial marker) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); and study the coherence of local brain
activity and functional connectivity in basal ganglia and dorsomedial prefrontal cortical (dmPFC) regions using
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline, 1 and 6-weeks of treatment. Using
standardized instruments, we will measure anhedonia and psychomotor slowing while sampling blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (6 weeks only) for inflammatory mediators and KYN metabolites. This study design will test
the hypotheses that a 6-week leucine challenge will decrease glutamate and inositol (Aim 1), improve local
activity coherence and functional connectivity in the basal ganglia and dmPFC (Aim 2), and reduce anhedonia
and psychomotor slowing (Aim 3). If supported, these aims will implicate KYN dysregulation as a key mediator
of the brain and behavioral changes induced by inflammation and aging in MD. Moreover, this proof-of-
mechanism proposal will identify KYN and its transporters in the BBB as key targets for novel drug
development for treating anhedonia and psychomotor slowing in MD patients and potentially preventing
neurodegeneration and dementia."
10922859,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite widespread efforts to implement lifestyle interventions aimed at restricting energy intake and increasing
physical activity, weight loss success has been limited and obesity prevalence continues to rise. Thus, there is
a critical need to develop novel strategies to prevent obesity and related cardiometabolic risks. Short sleep
duration is a highly prevalent behavior and is strongly associated with obesity risk among young adults.
Experimental laboratory evidence indicates that short sleep duration may increase obesity risk primarily through
food-seeking behavior and overeating. We have recently demonstrated that short-term sleep extension in real-
life settings in young adults with habitual short sleep reduces energy intake by a significant amount, and thus
might be a potent strategy to improve weight loss outcomes in lifestyle interventions with calorie-restricting diets.
To our knowledge, no prior weight loss intervention trial specifically examined the effects of extending sleep
duration on weight loss outcomes in young adults. We, thus, propose a randomized clinical trial to determine
whether weight loss outcomes in lifestyle interventions can be improved by adding an intervention component to
extend sleep duration in overweight young adults with habitual short sleep duration. Overweight young adults
who habitually sleep <6.5 hours will be randomized to either a lifestyle intervention alone (diet and activity
counseling) or a lifestyle plus sleep intervention (diet, activity, and sleep counseling). All participants will
receive a technology-supported intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss with biweekly remote coaching for
6 months (Intervention). Participants assigned to lifestyle plus sleep intervention will also receive individualized
sleep counseling to extend sleep duration, proven successful in our prior work, and tailored feedback.
Participants will continue their assigned intervention for an additional 6 months without frequent contact
(Maintenance). Sleep will be objectively assessed by accelerometry. Participants will self-monitor their diet
(record all dietary intake into a custom smartphone app), physical activity (by accelerometry), and self-weigh
daily on a wireless scale. Our specific aims are to determine whether lifestyle plus sleep intervention produces
a greater weight loss (Aim1) and a greater reduction in objectively assessed (using doubly labeled water/energy
balance method) energy intake (Aim2), as compared with lifestyle intervention alone. We will compare the
change in weight (primary outcome) and energy intake (secondary outcome) at 6 months between groups. We
will collect additional data on behavioral, biological, and psychosocial factors to explore their effects on
intervention responses and generate novel insights. Weight change at 12 months (end maintenance) will be an
exploratory outcome. If effective, data from this trial would strongly support incorporating sleep interventions into
behavioral weight loss programs and provide the evidence base needed to guide tailored behavior change
strategies for preventing obesity and related cardiometabolic risk in young adults with insufficient sleep duration."

Phosphatases and kinases are established classes of drug targets in oncology due to the presence of structured
catalytic pockets or allosteric sites that can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors. To expand our knowledge
of phosphatase and kinase and dependencies in AML, we recently completed domain-focused CRISPR
screening studies in search of AML-specific dependencies. These efforts revealed a poorly studied phosphatase
SCP4 as a dependency unique to AML, whereas normal human hematopoietic cells can tolerate loss of this
enzyme. Our biochemical investigation revealed an intimate linkage between SCP4 and the poorly studied
kinase paralogs STK35 and PDIK1L. We have shown that SCP4 interacts with, stabilizes, and removes inhibitory
phosphorylation from the activation loops of STK35 and PDIK1L. While the novelty and the therapeutic potential
of our work is clear, mechanistic gaps still remain in our knowledge of this signaling complex. Therefore, we now
seek to elucidate the genetic, biochemical, and structural mechanisms of SCP4-STK35-PDIK1L function in AML
with the intent of establishing insights and assays that can reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting this
pathway. The two Principal Investigators of this Project are Dr. Chris Vakoc (CSHL) and Dr. Yan Jessie Zhang
(UT Austin), who bring complementary expertise in epigenomics and structural biology, respectively. The first
aim of this project will be to evaluate SCP4 dependency in primary human AML patient samples and in normal
human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). These experiments will rely on new CRISPR vectors
developed by Dr. Junwei Shi (UPENN, Co-Investigator) that allow for the efficient generation of genetic
knockouts in primary AML patient samples. By targeting SCP4 in diverse AML patient samples and in normal
human hematopoietic cells (in vitro and in vivo), we seek to understand which AML subtype is most dependent
on SCP4 for disease maintenance. The second aim will seek to apply structural biology approaches to SCP4,
STK35, and PDIK1L, with a focus on X-ray crystallography. A major objective will be to understand the catalytic
mechanism and the structural basis of substrate recognition, and a substantial body of preliminary data supports
the feasibility of these efforts. The third aim will perform genomescale epistasis screens, in search of modifiers
and determinants of SCP4 dependency. This strategy will evaluate SCP4 as a critical component of a larger
signaling network, with a goal of revealing novel components of the pathway. Finally, the fourth aim will seek to
apply biochemical and epigenomic methods to SCP4, STK35, and PDIK1L in search of downstream effectors,
with a particular focus on transcription factors whose function is directly or indirectly regulated by this signaling
complex. In summary, our collaborative team will apply rigorous and innovative genetic, biochemical, and
structural approaches to reveal fundamental insights into an entirely novel signaling pathway and to provide a
rich resource of insights and assays that can drive the development novel targeted therapies for AML."

degeneration, and to use this information to develop effective therapies to prevent vision loss from these
blinding disorders. IRDs are important causes of vision loss that affect people across the age spectrum. While
great progress has been made identifying the genetic causes of IRDs, approximately 1/3rd of patients have
genetic causality that remains elusive. Further, the mechanisms by which mutations in specific IRD disease
genes cause retinal degeneration remain to be defined for the majority of IRD disease genes. Identifying the
genetic causes of IRDs and the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis has become especially important as
genetic therapies such as gene augmentation therapy and neuroprotective therapies show great promise for
the treatment of IRDs. But several challenges remain to be addressed to succeed with broad application of
genetically informed therapies for IRDs. These include the need to define genetic causality for the 1/3rd of
patients with elusive genetic causes of disease, and the need to more completely define the cellular
mechanisms that connect mutations in a given gene with photoreceptor and RPE degeneration. The goal of
Aim 1 is to address the first of these challenges. Evidence suggests that the majority of IRD disease genes
have been identified, leading to the hypothesis that much of the missing genetic causality in the 1/3rd of IRD
patients resides in the non-coding portions of the currently known IRD disease genes. It is challenging,
however, to determine which of the 100s of rare deep intronic variants identified by whole genome sequencing
(WGS) in IRD genes in patients with IRDs are pathogenic. In Aim 1 a novel high throughput splicing assay
(HTSA) will be used to empirically test the functional effects of rare deep intronic variants identified in patients
with IRDs and to prospectively characterize rare deep intronic variants in actionable IRD genes. The goal of
Aim 2 is to address the second challenge by studying the mechanisms by which mutations in NMNAT1 cause
severe early onset IRD. Despite being required for nuclear NAD+ synthesis in all cells, reduced NMNAT1
function causes retina-specific disease in most patients. Data from studies using a mouse model of NMNAT1-
associated disease suggest that photoreceptor cells have the greatest demand for DNA repair of any cells in
the human body and thus are the most vulnerable to reduced NMNAT1 function. To identify the source(s) of
the DNA damage that underlie this high demand for DNA repair in photoreceptor cells the DNA modifications
that accumulate and the DNA damage response pathways that are activated in mouse and human models of
NMNAT1-associated disease will be studied in Aim 2. The results of these studies could inform development
of additional therapies for NMNAT1-associated IRD, and potentially other forms of IRD as well."
10765421,"The long-range goal of my laboratory is to measure the conformations of biomolecules at the single molecule
level with nanometer and (sub)-millisecond resolution, ultimately in a cell. Here our focus is mostly on conforma-
tional changes within the cytoplasmic molecular motors—kinesin and dynein and eventually myosin— and on a
new “limping” mechanism that may lead to short (in distance and time) substeps. We also investigate motors’
response when multiple ones operate on a cargo simultaneously and how they respond to force, which may
underpin many clinical abnormalities. Both in vitro and in vivo (cellular) measurements are proposed.
 On single kinesins, for example, in vitro conformational changes involving sub-steps have recently been
revealed and extending this to other motors and as a function of force is a major goal. This work requires MIN-
FLUX (Project 1), a fluorescence technique that can achieve extraordinary resolution of 1–2 nm at a rate of 0.1–
1 msec, while extending the photobleaching time to many minutes. Doing this under force with nanometer-size
fluorescent probes means that almost any site can be monitored—but without the limitation of optical traps which
require large beads to monitor only the center-of-mass. MINFLUX will also be used in vivo, looking at fluorescent
peroxisomes moving radially away (via kinesin) and towards (via dynein) the nucleus of a cell. Combined with
recent drugs, this approach will enable us to determine whether the speed of the cargo is a function of the type
and number of motors, as we (controversially) proposed. The Univ. of Illinois has recently purchased a MINFLUX
microscope that we will use in this work. It will also be extended to have an applied force.
 MINFLUX, however, can look at only one fluorescent molecule at a time, making acquiring statistics slow
and the simultaneous conformations of many motors difficult. In contrast, Fluorescence Imaging with One Na-
nometer Accuracy (FIONA), which we invented in 2003, can look at a whole ensemble of molecules with na-
nometer- and msec resolution. But to see biomolecules with such fast resolution, an unusually bright fluorophore
that doesn’t bleach is required. In Project 2, quantum dots (QDs) and fluorescence nanodiamonds (FND)—
particularly within 50 nm of a photonic crystal (PC)—give (an amazing) 900––3000-fold increase in fluorescence
with little blinking. For the first time, PCs will be applied in vitro to molecular motors (by FIONA and possibly by
MINFLUX, all with an applied force) and on living cells (to EGFR and AMPAR membrane proteins).
 In Project 3, we have a new technique for intracellular, live cell labeling that will enable (organic) fluorophores
to penetrate the cell membrane, sometimes in the presence of native oxygen. We can use either new fluoro-
phores (from Janelia Farms) combined with a new transfected protein (from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase,
eDHFR), or we can use Streptolysin O (SLO) that temporarily permeabilizes the cell membrane and allows
essentially any fluorophore to enter the cell. We show that three different fluorophores may be used simultane-
ously, extending our previously published technique."
10765057,"How do large molecules, including biological therapeutics, reach the cytosol if delivered from outside the cell?
Endocytic internalization (e.g., by clathrin-mediated endocytosis or fluid-phase uptake) is the principal route for
bringing these molecules into cells, but most internalized cargo remains entrapped until degraded in
lysosomes. Establishing potential mechanisms of endosome escape has generated long-standing
controversy, largely because of technical limitations that prevent direct detection.
Using recently developed 3D imaging modalities, especially lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) and its
combination with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM), we have shown that we can observe endosomal damage and
repair and link it to events such as endosomal fission and cargo delivery. We will characterize the
mechanism(s) of the delivery events and seek ways to regulate the delivery route, with the aim of achieving a
full description of how endosomal membrane damage and repair govern endosomal escape. We will develop
novel ways to exploit the deep-learning approaches that will be essential for analyzing the huge data sets we
now generate (e.g., 3D, diffraction-limited movies of an entire cell in two or three colors at 2 sec intervals for 5
or more minutes).
Our long-term goal is to build on mechanistic understanding to work out how to enhance specific release of
desired cargo, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs), or in other circumstances, how to prevent release of deleterious cargo, such as 𝛂-synuclein and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)."

 Defining and Avoiding Molecular Mechanisms of Drug Resistance
Drug resistance is a major challenge in modern medicine. Resistance impacts the lives of millions, limiting the
effectiveness of many of our most potent drugs. This often happens under the selective pressure of therapy in
bacterial, viral, and fungal infections and in cancer due to rapid evolution. Instead of considering resistance
only after a drug fails, we need a paradigm shift to incorporate preemptive strategies into drug design to avoid
resistance. Research in my laboratory combines a variety of experimental and computational techniques to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and to lay the foundation for developing strategies to
avoid resistance in drug design. The rapid evolution of viruses continues to challenge our therapies,
highlighting the significance of deciphering the intersection of evolution and resistance.
Insights from my years of research on HIV-1 protease and subsequently other viral proteases led to
fundamental concepts including that primary resistance mutations occur where inhibitors physically contact
regions of the active site beyond the substrate envelope. I hypothesized that inhibitors that stay within the
substrate envelope are less susceptible to drug resistance. Validating this hypothesis, my strategy of adding
the constraint that inhibitors must stay within the substrate envelope in structure-based drug design (SBDD)
yielded extremely potent inhibitors that are effective against resistant variants. Beyond the substrate envelope,
I have demonstrated mutations distal from the active site also significantly contribute to resistance.
My ongoing research is 1) characterizing the molecular mechanisms of these distal changes in conferring
resistance and 2) developing strategies to counter their impact. The complex and dynamic interplay between
such mutations necessitates integrated approaches. Thus, we are developing a novel strategy combining
parallel molecular dynamics (pMD) with machine learning and demonstrated the feasibility and power of this
approach in identifying key physical interactions that are indicators of resistance. We are now assessing
whether a similar approaches, optimizing various linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms, can be
used to evaluate a set of inhibitors, with various functional groups.
In the future we will leverage lessons learned, specifically the substrate envelope concept and pMD coupled
with machine learning, to a diverse set of drug targets in quickly evolving diseases. My long-term goal is to
develop broadly applicable approaches leveraging machine learning in SBDD to guide inhibitor selection, to
avoid resistance and enhance potency for diverse enzyme targets . Overall, I expect to decipher principles and
mechanisms that underlie drug resistance by developing and optimizing tools to capture the essential
dynamics of a given drug-target system toward devising broadly applicable strategies to identify robust
inhibitors that retain potency in the face of evolution."
10765145,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our lab studies mechanisms that control regulated cell death (RCD). Recent studies have uncovered the
existence of 15 distinct forms of RCD. These include different forms of apoptosis, and twelve mechanistically
distinct forms of regulated necrosis, including ferroptosis, necroptosis, oxeiptosis, and parthanatos. In general,
RCD describes situations in which cell death results from the use of specific mechanisms to sense stress, defined
signaling cascades to transmit information, and use of specific effector molecules that dismantle or rupture the
cell. Thus, a key feature of all forms of RCD is that death is not an inevitable consequence of overwhelming
stress, but rather, a decision which is proactively made by the cell. For most forms of RCD, how these decisions
are made remains unclear. Over the past five years, we have focused on understanding how different forms of
death are regulated and identifying features that contribute to variation in cell death responses. Our work has
revealed that variation in cell death outcomes is often caused by inhibitory interactions between different cell
death pathways. While, our work clearly demonstrates that death pathways inhibit each other phenotypically,
mechanisms of interaction remain unclear, largely due to our limited understanding of most forms of regulated
necrosis. Over the next five years, we aim to understand – with mechanistic detail – how different types of death
interact, and the therapeutic implications of these interactions. To facilitate these efforts, we have developed
new experimental and computational approaches for studying cell death, new genetic screening approaches for
identifying death regulatory genes, and new computational tools for inferring the activation dynamics and circuitry
of death regulatory processes. Combined, these new methods allow us to study every cell death pathway, each
with equal precision and sensitivity, and with unprecedented ease and throughput. Using these methods, we will
identify mechanisms of regulation and mechanisms of coordination between apoptotic and non-apoptotic forms
of death. We will explore the implications of interactions between death pathways on the efficacy of combination
drug therapies. Finally, we will characterize unexpected death regulatory pathways that we have identified in the
context of dysregulated gene expression. Our vision is that our deep insights into the mechanisms of RCD will
have immediate therapeutic implications for diseases like cancer, where therapies need to kill cancer cells with
selectivity and precision. To facilitate this vision, our approach is to study cell death in normal and cancer cells,
in the context of drug therapy. Additionally, to improve our ability to translate our findings to other relevant
contexts, we study cell death across varied environmental and genetic contexts, and we use mathematical
modeling and bioinformatic analyses to identify features that are predictive of the observed phenotypes."
10781234,"Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer neurodegeneration and functional decline despite effective
management of new inflammatory lesion formation by modern treatments. We must therefore identify
modifiable risk and protective factors associated with disease progression. There is high interest among people
living with MS and their clinicians about the protective effects of diet, and we have linked Mediterranean diet to
less cerebral atrophy and better functional outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This R01
will evaluate biological aging as a mediator for observed effects of diet on neurodegeneration and disease
progression in MS. Our team has linked biological aging to neurodegeneration in MS, and others have linked
biological aging to Mediterranean-style diets in non-MS populations, which informed our hypothesis that
biological aging (BA), measured through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Biological
Aging Index (NHANES BAI) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL), is a mediator of observed effects of diet on
neurodegeneration in MS. The study will leverage two distinct pre-existing cohorts with rich clinical and
imaging data and specimen collection. The first is RADIEMS (Reserve Against Disability in Early MS), an NIH-
funded longitudinal study of risk and protective factors for disability in people with early MS that enrolled 185
people with MS in 2016-2017. This cohort provides longitudinal dietary, clinical, and imaging data, and
specimens. The current proposal will link into RADIEMS follow up for the next 3 years but will also be able to
powerful analyses encompassing 8 years of follow up data. The second is a cross-
enrolled in Project Y in 2016 at age 50. The Project Y cohort will provide additional information on an older
population of individuals with MS as well as provide a data set where chronological age is constant, simplifying
the biological aging analyses. The specific aims are designed to evaluate: the effect of diet on biological age in
people with MS (aim 1), the impact of diet and BA on brain atrophy and the degree to which dietary
relationships are mediated by BA (aim 2), the impact of diet and BA on clinical MS worsening and the degree
to which dietary relationships are mediated by BA (aim 3). These will be accomplished by adding the NHANES
BAI to RADIEMS (which requires participant interaction but can be done because RADIEMS is ongoing) and
by adding LTL analysis to both cohorts (which can be done using banked samples). Detailed data on other
health behaviors and demographics are available for both cohorts and will be considered and accounted for in
all analyses. This study will contribute to a growing body of literature that will help inform a more holistic
approach to MS care, which is eagerly sought by people living with MS. The results of this proposal have high
potential for impact in advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration and informing
recommendations for lifestyle modifications to promote neuroprotection in MS."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a primary cause of the marked increase of ASCVD, accounting for over 30%
of symptomatic cases. Accordingly, the ASCVD risk in T2DM patients is 2-4 fold more than in the non-T2DM
population. The concomitant increase of T2DM and ASCVD in the US prompted the urgency for accurate ASCVD
prediction followed by an effective mitigation strategy. However, recent clinical trials and extensive cohort studies
revealed underachievement by controlling conventional lipid/hypertension/glycemic factors, warranting new
directions additional to the existing mitigation paradigm. Furthermore, multiple studies comparing existing
ASCVD risk prediction models, including those derived from general or T2DM populations, achieved only
marginal or underperformance in multiple independent cohorts, endorsing the significance of this significant
unmet biomedical challenge. Our proposed study aims to fill this critical scientific and clinical gap in increased
atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease risk (ASCVD) in T2DM. Supported by our recent discoveries and
development of multiple immune cell annotation tools, we propose to test the overarching hypothesis that the
foaming process in circulating monocytes can be directly altered by T2DM towards pathogenic foaming, thus
directly contributing to the elevated risk of ASCVD. Application of our newly developed cell function annotation
tools uncovered distinct macrophage-derived foam cell development programs, followed by ASCVD causal gene
signature identification and proof-of-concept ASCVD predictive modeling by incorporating a selected gene list
using the original machine learning program. Our new work further revealed that super-networks governed by
three upstream regulators are uniquely altered by T2DM and associated with future ASCVD incidence. Hence,
in two aims: (AIM 1) we will determine the impact of suppressed super-networks governed by identified master
regulators (SNW1, NCOR2, CITED2) on pathogenic foaming program using established foam cell development
system with quantitative methods and single cell transcriptomics; (AIM 2) will assess the efficacy of T2DM-
ASCVD signatures on predictive modeling using existing and innovative feature selection and feature extraction
tools. Completing this project will provide crucial information to significantly advance our understanding of
ASCVD risk in the T2DM population. Our innovative computational programs, derived from novel and in-depth
mechanistic investigation, will offer translatable ASCVD prediction tools and molecular targets for drug
development to achieve personalized intervention for T2DM patients to mitigate ASCVD risks."
10780070,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The leading cause of mortality for infants from 1–12 months is sudden unexpected infant death (SUID),
encompassing both suffocation-related deaths and sudden infant death syndrome. No single condition appears
to cause SUID, but many deaths occur within infant products not intended for sleep where suffocation likely
played a role. Retrospective fatality data identify contributing risk factors and hazard modes as biomechanical-
based factors including body position, infant product interaction, and feeding. However, researchers have yet
to quantify a relationship between these factors and infant respiration, leaving clinicians, parents, and
manufacturers of infant products with little evidence-based guidance on the best biomechanical practices to
avoid SUID. The proposed study would respond to this problem. It would also substantively advance the
biomechanics domain as the first to use biomechanics as the foundational science through which to study
SUID. We will bring a multidisciplinary team (infant biomechanics, juvenile product design and assessment,
computational modeling, pediatric pulmonology, and infant development) to this effort to untangle the complex
relationships between biomechanics and SUID. The goal of this research project is to significantly reduce
infant mortality by quantifying the respiratory effects from biomechanical SUID risk factors. The objective of our
study is to integrate in vivo human subjects biomechanics experiments and computational modeling to define
the relationships between respiration and biomechanical factors (body position, product interaction, and
feeding) which influence breathing. The central hypothesis is that biomechanical-related risk factors of SUID
affect younger and preterm infants more adversely than older or full-term infants. We will quantify relationships
between biomechanical factors and respiration via three specific aims: (1) Quantify relationship between infant
body position and breathing biomechanics, (2) Determine how product design features effect head/neck flexion
and trunk expansion using computational modeling, and (3) Evaluate effect of feeding on breathing
biomechanics in vivo. This project will provide a foundational understanding of how body position, product
features, and feeding affect infant breathing biomechanics, and will likely help flag the very real danger of
some infant products currently on the market. Deliverables include: (1) the first analysis of common body
positions on infant breathing biomechanics, (2) computational models to inform product designers and reduce
SUID risk, (3) characterization of breathing biomechanics changes after feeding to guide caregiving practices,
and (4) industry dissemination workshops. Collectively, these data would provide needed insight to advance
understanding of SUID-related deaths in relation to body position and daily life, and provide industry, parents,
and clinicians with the research upon which to inform biomechanics-based safe-sleep and infant care
guidelines."

Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide and host-bacterial microbiota interactions
profoundly influence tumorigenesis, cancer progression and response to therapies. Nevertheless, the
role of fungi (mycobiota) in these processes remain largely unexplored, missing a potential opportunity
for developing novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. Across the population,
colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type. In addition to bacteria, we recently
described the presence of live, transcriptionally active fungi in colorectal cancers. Here, we preset
further evidence for the presence of active mycobiota in colorectal tumors and experimental data
supporting a hypothesis that fungi play an important role in colon cancer growth and response to
therapies through the interaction of fungal metabolites and virulence factors in the tumor macro- and
micro-environment. We will use novel methodologies and in vivo modeling allowing to determine fungal
species and factors that influence CRC. We will determine specific immune mediators and cells of the
immune system that interact with fungi in the tumors, and pinpoint mechanisms by which specific fungal
strains influence the tumor microenvironment and impact tumor growth. We will further characterize
fungi in tumors of patient and mice to determine the utility of the mycobiome as a predictor of cancer
progression, survival, and response to therapies. The results of these studies will contribute towards
better understanding of host-mycobiota interactions in cancer and might provide a basis for novel
diagnostic, therapeutic and co-therapeutic anticancer approaches in CRC by targeting the fungal arm
of the microbiome."
10975853,"Abstract
Chronic primary pain conditions (CPPCs) such as fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorder (TMD)
constitute a significant healthcare problem that affects over 100 million, predominately female, Americans. The
origin of CPPCs is linked to genetic and environmental factors that enhance catecholamine tone. An estimated
2 in 3 patients with CPPCs have variants in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; an enzyme
that metabolizes catecholamines) that result in low COMT activity and increased catecholamine levels. Pain in
these individuals is enhanced by stressful events (eg, motor vehicle collision) resulting in increased release of
catecholamines from sympathetic nerves. Our lab has shown that catecholamines drive pain via activation of
peripheral beta-adrenergic receptor 3 (Adrb3) and downstream mediators that regulate neuronal excitability and
immune responses. Catecholamine signaling has also been shown to alter the expression of microRNAs
(miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate mRNA targets. However, the role of miRNA
dysregulation in CPPC pathophysiology remains understudied and unclear. Preliminary data from our case-
control study reveal that patients with TMD have decreased levels of miR-374. We replicated this finding in an
animal model of CPPCs where mice with low COMT activity exposed to stress exhibited pain and decreased
levels of miR-374. In the same mice, 5 miR-374 mRNA targets that were dysregulated in patients with TMD
(ATXN7, CRK, HIF1A, NUMB, and TGFBR2) were also dysregulated in adipose and spinal cord tissues, where
they are predicted to influence immune signaling and pain. HIF1A, NUMB, and TGFBR2 were upregulated in
adipose from female mice, while ATXN7 and TGFBR2 were downregulated in spinal cord from male mice. These
findings point to new RNA targets that may play an important role in pain related to heightened catecholamine
tone, yet mechanistic studies are needed to determine their causal role. Thus, the objective of this proposal
is to directly test the relationship between miR-374, its mRNA targets, pain, and inflammation. My central
hypothesis is that catecholamine activation of Adrb3 reduces levels of miR-374, leading to dysregulation of
mRNAs that promote inflammation and chronic pain in a sex hormone-dependent manner. I will use primary
adipocytes and neurons to measure 1) miR-374 binding to mRNA targets using a luciferase reporter system and
2) the effects of Adrb3 activation and sex hormones on miR-374 and mRNA target expression using qPCR. In
our CPPC mouse model, I will also measure 3) the effects of synthetic miR-374 overexpression and antagonism
on pain and cytokine production, and 4) miR-374 and mRNA target expression in distinct cell types using
combined RNAscope and immunohistochemical methods. These results will elucidate our understanding of
epigenetic mechanisms contributing to CPPCs and identify novel targets for improved treatment options for those
with these conditions. The proposed training plan will promote development of new in vitro and in vivo techniques
and foster career advancement in a highly supportive and collaborative environment at Duke University."

10890184,"Project Summary
Organ transplantation (Tx) is the mainstay therapy for patients with end-stage organ failure. Yet, barriers
exist that preclude long-term graft survival. It is well-established that early injury to the allograft, during the
donor organ preservation and reperfusion phases, set the organ up for late failure. Based on studies from
our laboratory, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and early alloimmunity, mediated by memory T cells, are
among the most prevalent and inevitable early injuries affecting endothelial cells (ECs) as the first point of
contact. Thus, our scientific premise revolves around the allograft's endothelium as central to these insults.
The endothelium contains an intact layer of aligned ECs that are joined by cell-to-cell junctions and enables
them to communicate and form a protective barrier. During IRI and early alloimmunity, the EC barrier is
disrupted, predisposing the ECs to inappropriate antigen presentation ultimately resulting in late graft failure.
Thus, the EC barrier is vital for graft protection. Endothelial cell-to-cell communication is dependent upon
gap junctions including connexin 43 (Cx43). Whether Cx43 gap junctions play a role in protecting the EC
barrier and dampening EC immunogenicity against early injuries allowing for a therapeutic target, forms the
central question of our proposal. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that stabilizing and/or
overexpressing Cx43 gap junctions in ECs will mitigate early graft injury. To study this hypothesis, we
propose two Aims: Specific Aim 1 - Elucidate the role of Cx43 gap junction protein on EC
activation/immunogenicity during IRI in vitro. Specific Aim 2 - Demonstrate the preclinical ability to
downregulate the EC activation/immunogenicity in transplanted hearts in vivo by maintaining Cx43
protein levels via pre-treatment of donor hearts. Common to these aims, we will employ an in vitro model
of injury that simulates cold ischemia and warm reperfusion injury to study the role of Cx43 gap junctions on
EC health and immunogenicity. We will also employ clinically relevant in vivo brain-death mouse models of
IRI and alloimmune cardiac Tx and utilize a novel and unique donor organ pre-treatment strategy to deliver
Cx43 modulating agents. These innovative and high-risk high-reward studies will be the first to define the
specific and focused impact of Cx43 gap junction in ECs, associated with organ preservation and
reperfusion. Furthermore, it will provide a proof-of-concept to target the Cx43 gap junction in ECs prior to
transplantation using our unique pretreatment strategy which will set a stage for a paradigm shift in the
current standard of care during organ Tx."
10886133,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a very common healthcare- and community-associated infection in US
children and adults. CDI, which ranges from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis, is associated with
substantial morbidity, mortality, and excess healthcare expenditures. The CDC has classified C. difficile as an
“immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action.” Immunological agents are a
promising emerging strategy for CDI prevention; a monoclonal antibody against C. difficile is recently FDA
approved for CDI prevention, and several toxin-based vaccines are in clinical development. Despite these
products showing promise for CDI prevention, many patients have failed these therapies. These products were
developed based on knowledge of C. difficile immunogenicity in animals, which may not adequately represent
C. difficile immunogenicity in humans. To address this knowledge gap, we propose characterization of the
plasmablast response following natural CDI in humans. Plasmablasts are plasma cell precursors that produce
antibodies directed against a pathogen; antigen-specific plasmablasts can be isolated from peripheral blood 1-
2 weeks after infection. Antibodies encoded by these cells can be produced in vitro and used to identify the
targeted antigens. We aim to apply this innovative approach to CDI. First, we will develop a panel of
monoclonal antibodies from humans with acute C. difficile infection by specifically doing the following: (1a)
Isolate and characterize single cell peripheral plasmablasts from 16 children and adults at 1-2 weeks after
onset of acute CDI; and (1b) Prepare monoclonal antibodies from clonally expanded plasmablasts within each
subject’s plasmablast pool. Next, using these antibodies, we will identify the antigenic targets of C. difficile-
specific human monoclonal antibodies by specifically doing the following: (2a) Perform whole genome
sequencing of C. difficile isolated from each subject; (2b) Identify toxin A and B-specific antibodies by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), determine their ability to neutralize toxin in a cell culture cytotoxicity
assay, and identify the specific toxin epitopes by peptide microarray; (2c) For antibodies that do not recognize
toxins A or B, perform ELISA for well-characterized C. difficile non-toxin antigens flagellin (FliC) and surface
layer protein A (SlpA), and using a surface protein preparation (SPP) prepared from each patient’s infecting
isolate; and (2d) For antibodies that bind to the subject’s C. difficile SPP by ELISA but whose target remains
unknown, perform western blot (linear epitopes) and immunoprecipitation (conformational epitopes) of a SPP
from each subject’s isolate and identify the specific protein my tandem mass spectrometry. Through this
innovative approach to clone the human plasmablast response to CDI, we will identify an array of antigens
targeted by the human humoral immune response following acute CDI and develop a panel of C. difficile-
specific human monoclonal antibodies that target a variety of toxin and non-toxin antigens and epitopes. We
will thereby identify candidate antigens that will inform future immunotherapies and vaccine strategies."

10758284,"Project Summary
 Apidaecin (Api) and Drosocin (Dro), are proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) produced by honeybees and
fruit flies, respectively, which share a unique mechanism of action. Our previous studies of Api showed that upon entering
Gram-negative bacterial cells through the SbmA transporter, Api binds in the exit tunnel of ribosomes that have just released
the newly made protein and arrests the ribosomes at stop codons by trapping the associated tRNA and release factor. As
such, Api represents the first-ever described specific inhibitor of translation termination. Our subsequent whole-genome
studies revealed that arresting terminating ribosomes triggers several downstream events that accentuate the inhibitory
action of this PrAMP, including ribosome queuing and readthrough of stop codons. Our preliminary data indicate that Dro,
despite its distinct amino acid sequence, inhibits the termination step of translation as well, by a mechanism likely resembling
that of Api. Their idiosyncratic mode of binding to the target, the unique mechanism of action, and the triggering of
downstream effects harmful for the bacterial cell, make these antibacterial peptides an attractive model for developing novel
antibiotics. Furthermore, the biological nature of these PrAMPs opens unique opportunities for their screening and
optimization by generating hundreds of thousands of peptide variants directly in bacterial cells.
 In the current proposal we will use the combined effort of three laboratories with expertise in biochemistry and
genomics of ribosomal antibiotics, in peptide chemistry and in structural analysis of ribosome-antibiotic complexes to
advance the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of action of Api- and Dro-like translation termination inhibitors
and identify derivatives with superior on-target activity and expanded spectrum of antibacterial action. In order to achieve
these goals we will test arrays of Api and Dro variants in bacterial cells by the tunable expression of peptide gene libraries,
determine high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of ribosome-peptide complexes, and employ rational structure-based
design to generate via chemical synthesis peptide variants with superior properties. Specifically: In Aim 1, we will identify
Api-derived peptides with improved activity upon ribosomes from Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. In Aim 2,
the spectrum of action of Api-like peptides will be expanded by bypassing the necessity for uptake by the SbmA transporter.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the ribosome binding and mechanism of action of Dro-like peptides and use comparative
analysis to identify the key features that define the class of antimicrobial peptides that target translation termination. The
three Aims are tightly interconnected but completely independent from each other.
 The reagents and tools that will be generated in the course of the proposed work are aimed to serve as leads for
future clinical development. Importantly, the results obtained in the proposed studies will significantly advance the
fundamental understanding of the properties and mechanisms of action of PrAMPs and will stimulate the progress of the
field of ribosome-targeting antibacterial peptides, which currently is still in its infancy."

 The objective of this project is to further develop a breakthrough Toehold-Enrichment-
Extraction (TEE) technology and validate TEE-based tests for use in cancer detection and care
management. TEE is a novel DNA extraction method. Unlike conventional extraction methods,
TEE extracts mutated DNA while enriching it with high recovery. Moreover, unlike current PCR-
based enrichment methods, TEE enriches mutated DNA without altering original DNA sequences.
We have shown that TEE could enrich mutated DNA by as much as 1000 fold. Therefore, when
TEE is used to extract DNA for a mutation detection test, it significantly increases analytical
sensitivity of the test, leading to accurate detection of mutated DNA at a much lower concentration
level, which could not be achieved if a conventional method is used to extract DNA. To illustrate,
when a conventional method is used to extract DNA, Sanger sequencing cannot detect mutated
DNA if its concentration is less than 20%. In contrast, when TEE is used to extract mutated DNA,
it enables Sanger sequencing to detect 0.1% mutated DNA. In other words, Sanger-sequencing
becomes as sensitive as digital PCR or NGS when we incorporate TEE into Sanger sequencing
(we term this combination TEE-Sanger sequencing) for mutation analysis. Furthermore, we have
demonstrated that TEE-Sanger sequencing could detect mutated DNA from clinical specimen like
FFPE tumor tissue and blood (serum) samples, indicating that TEE-based testing is compatible
with clinical applications.
 Since TEE is a DNA extraction method, it can replace conventional methods to extract
DNA for mutation analysis. Moreover, TEE is not only a breakthrough technology, but also a
platform on which various TEE-based tests can be developed for different clinical applications.
Inspired by the success of our preliminary study and potential of the TEE technology, we propose
this SBIR Phase II project to further study the TEE technology, providing a strong foundation for
its commercialization. This project has four specific aims."

Chagas disease, caused by infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most prevalent parasitic disease in the
western hemisphere, infecting 8-11 million individuals and with over 70 million at risk. The infection is transmitted
by an insect vector, but can also be acquired through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or congenitally.
Following a brief acute phase, the parasite persists for years as a chronic, but often asymptomatic infection,
which may progress to cardiomyopathy and other pathological conditions leading to severe morbidity and
mortality. In the U.S., the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in immigrant populations has led to the implementation
of blood screening assays to prevent transfusion transmission. Autochthonous transmission can be expected
based on the gradual encroachment of the insect vector into the southernmost regions of the U.S. Treatment for
Chagas disease currently relies on two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox. While these drugs are highly
effective if used during the acute phase, their efficacy in the chronic phase varies, decreasing with increasing
duration of infection. Moreover, due to their known toxicity, both drugs are known to have frequent adverse
effects, which intensify with patient age. Benznidazole has been approved by FDA only for use on children aged
2-12, while nifurtimox has been approved for children up to age 18; adults are currently treated off-label. A
variety of efforts are underway to develop new drugs to treat Chagas disease, supported by public health
organizations and pharmaceutical companies. However, a major limitation is the lack of a reliable, standardized
and validated test to measure the efficacy of Chagas drugs and to establish whether treatment is successfully
eliminating an individual patient’s infection for purposes of clinical management.
The aim of this project is the development of a test that measures the response to treatment in Chagas disease
patients that will address these needs. Of the methodologies that have been evaluated for measuring effects of
drug treatment on T. cruzi infection, serology has been the mainstay. A decrease in antibody titer to T. cruzi
over time following treatment has been used as a de facto test for treatment response, but no commercial assay
has been designed and validated for this use, and available assays only show changes in antibody titer over a
period of many years. In Phase I, we identified T. cruzi peptide antigens to which IgG antibody titers declined
rapidly in treated patients, providing a sensitive means to measure treatment response within a year. Prototype
assays based on these peptides have been developed in both ELISA and lateral flow formats to enable testing
in both laboratory and point-of-care settings. In Phase II, the performance of the assays as indicators of treatment
response will be evaluated in comparison with conventional serological tests and PCR on well-characterized
retrospective serum samples obtained at serial post-treatment time points, and on prospectively acquired
samples from patients newly diagnosed and in the course of treatment. Validation of the ELISA and lateral flow
assays will lead to introduction of the first commercially available tests of treatment response for Chagas disease."

HIV is naturally transmitted as a virus swarm, which establishes infection via only one or few transmitted/founder
(T/F) viruses. Several observations strongly indicate that T/F viruses are non-randomly favored for productive
transmission via shared signature genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Current knowledge regarding Env-
coreceptor interactions suggest innovative concepts to explain the T/F phenotype. T/F virus envelopes of all
subtypes preferentially use the CCR5 coreceptor for entry in vitro and in vivo. Yet cell surface CCR5 is expressed
in multiple functional and antigenic forms with differential sensitivity to the antiretroviral CCR5 antagonist
maraviroc (MVC); affinity for natural chemokine ligands, and/or reactivity with anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs). Further, the abilities of various anti-CCR5 mAbs to inhibit CCR5 interactions with either tagged soluble
gp120s or pseudoviruses vary according to virus strain and target cell-type. Collectively, these findings prompt
the central hypothesis for this exploratory project: as a class, T/F viruses utilize signature CCR5 subpopulation(s)
that potentially favor more efficient entry and virus replication. Tests of this hypothesis will exploit how active
infection downregulates a “footprint” in the surface CCR5 population, distinguishing which subsets have been
engaged by HIV. We recently reported how innovative superresolution optical imaging methods reflect CI virus
use of distinct antigenic CCR5 forms. The two specific aims of this project will employ similar approaches to
generate an unprecedented view of T/F coreceptor usage and entry on primary cells (human monocytes,
lymphocytes and CD4+ T cells). The definition of “T/F CCR5” usage will impact HIV prevention/treatment efforts
by informing the development of more potent and selective CCR5-based interventions and by elucidating
complementary aspects of Env structure/function that confer coreceptor selectivity and the T/F phenotype. Such
features can be explored by molecular methods and translated to HIV vaccine design."
10763355,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Recent studies have shown that the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) can ‘de-differentiate’ and
undergo substantial ‘phenotypic modulation’ during atherogenesis. Novel lineage-tracing data revealed that a
subset of these cells assume a ‘stem-like’ phenotype and undergo significant clonal expansion, likely
potentiating plaque progression. Unfortunately, we do not yet know the mechanism by which these clonal
populations arise, how they promote disease, or whether they can be targeted for translational purposes.
 The broad, long-term goal of this proposal is to precisely define how clonal expansion occurs and how
to suppress it. In doing so, we will learn how to target the ‘atherosclerosis stem cell’ and develop novel
therapies for heart disease. Using new preliminary data generated via single-cell RNA-seq analysis of
multicolor lineage-tracer models, our team will test the hypothesis that ‘stem-like’ SMCs evade phagocytic
removal (allowing them to undergo clonal expansion) and activate the complement cascade (causing them to
exacerbate vascular inflammation). The project combines unique transgenic animals, highly specialized
human biorepository specimens and new interdisciplinary collaborations. The program is focused on three
broad efforts which will: 1. Determine if pro-phagocytic therapies can specifically prevent clonal expansion; 2.
Determine whether the ‘stem-like’ SMC requires the classical complement cascade to promote disease; and 3.
Determine if clonal SMC expansion also has translational relevance to human atherosclerosis. This proposal
will provide important insights into the root causes of SMC plasticity and determine how programmed cell
removal, or ‘efferocytosis’ (from Greek, meaning to carry the dead to the grave) contributes to atherosclerosis.
Ultimately, discoveries made in this highly flexible R35 project will support the stated mission of the National
Institutes of Health, provide tools for other HLBS investigators, train the next generation of investigators, and
lead to the development of new translational therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease."

This program project is an exploration of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus who are in long term
clinical remission on no corticosteroid or immunosuppressive medication.
We will study blood immune cells at the single cell level exploring distribution of cellular subsets and
transcriptional, epigenetic and proteomic profiles, as well as the repertoire of naive and memory B cells
reactive with nuclear antigens.
We will explore brain function in these patients to determine if there is ongoing inflammation in the central
nervous system in some patients despite a lack of inflammation in the periphery.
Given the now recognized interplay of the immune system and the brain, we will seek correlations between
immune cell profile and brain function.
As approximately 25% of patients in remission can be expected to relapse over 5 years, we will seek predictors
of relapse.
These studies should teach us about patient heterogeneity, novel states of immune or brain homeostasis, and
predictors of sustained remission or flare."
10763406,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The lower jaw evolved as a structure composed of many bones the largest of which, the dentary, persists as a
single lower jawbone in modern mammals, and is referred to as the mandible in humans. Mandibular disorders,
often resulting in small jaws, are among the most common human birth defects. These disorders can dramatically
affect quality of life, and are often associated, or compound problems with airway obstruction, speech, and
feeding. During embryogenesis, development of the mandible is preceded by and associated with a tubular
cartilage rod called Meckel's cartilage (MC) and anomalies of MC have been associated with mandibular
disorders. Development of MC in modern mammals is complex: the anterior part contributes to the formation of
the mandibular symphysis, its posterior part forms cartilages that mineralize endochondrally to form two middle
ear bones, and the posterior half of the middle region forms ligaments. Less is known about the anterior half of
the middle region of MC, which is transient, present during a small window of embryonic development before it
disappears. Established assessments describe MC as a template for the formation of the mandible, but evidence
of this is lacking and little is known of the relationship between the midportion of MC and mandibular
mineralization, size, and shape or the processes of MC growth in length, perichondrial ossification, and
disappearance of MC. We present data demonstrating that MC does not serve as a template in the way
cartilaginous models function in endochondral ossification and hypothesize a new role for the mid portion of MC
in determining mandibular length, mineralization of the perichondrium, mineralization of the mandible, and its
disappearance. Because our findings challenge the traditional role of MC, we have designed this project to
validate the developmental events that take place as the midportion of MC disappears and the mandible forms
through a detailed analysis of four processes: 1) initiation and growth in length of MC; 2) mineralization of MC
perichondrium; 3) mineralization of the mandible; and 4) disappearance of MC. Our approach is based on
knowledge we have gained through preliminary investigations of these processes occurring at different times
along the length of MC, and spanning the buccal to lingual aspects of the interior of MC. We couple 3D imaging
with tissue and cellular analyses of embryonic mutant Sox9flox/flox;Col2a1-CreERT, and Sox9flox/flox mice to
precisely define the changing cellular dynamics of the lower jaw in developmental time and anatomical space.
These data are used in turn to inform our RNA-seq analyses of the developing MC and mandible directed at
recovering the underlying transcriptome by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses. We
plan cell lineage tracing experiments to determine the fate of cells from the intermediate region of MC, those that
initiate MC perichondrial mineralization, and mandible mineralization. Our integrative approach is designed to
bring new understanding to lower jaw development and open novel research areas to advance strategies for
bone repair, regeneration, and prevention in mandibular disease."

From 2010-2020, Eastern Europe reported a 72% increase in new adult HIV infections, representing the
highest rate of increase globally. Among the Eastern European countries, the HIV epidemic in Ukraine is one
of the largest, with nearly 260,000 people with HIV (PWH). Nevertheless, in 2020, only 54% of Ukrainian PWH
were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and only 51% were virally suppressed. These suboptimal HIV care
continuum outcomes are partially attributable to mental disorders, which are more prevalent among PWH
generally (and in Ukraine specifically) and have been linked to decreased ART adherence and poor
engagement in HIV care. To minimize the adverse effects of impaired mental health on HIV outcomes, creating
a pathway to increase access to evidence-based mental health care is a critical public health need. The long-
term goal of this applicant is to develop expertise in testing transdiagnostic mental health interventions to
improve HIV outcomes among PWH in Ukraine. The objective of this K23 application is to adapt the Common
Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), by incorporating the single-session Life Steps ART adherence
intervention, to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress among PWH in Ukraine.
The central hypothesis to be tested is that the adapted CETA plus Life-Steps intervention will improve both HIV
and mental health outcomes among PWH in Ukraine. The strong preliminary data supporting this application
shows that community psychologists in Ukraine feel they do not have adequate knowledge to deliver mental
health treatment but nonetheless have strong interest in learning short-term treatments such as CETA. To test
the central hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: (1) To define relevant clinical and contextual
factors for adapting CETA for delivery in HIV clinics and for integrating Life-Steps into the existing protocol; (2)
To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted CETA plus Life-Steps
intervention; and (3) To estimate potential mediators and moderators of the adapted CETA plus Life-Steps
intervention. The expected outcome of this K23 is that this applicant will gain the expertise needed in the three
critical training areas of HIV and mental health, design of randomized clinical trials, and longitudinal data
analysis necessary to achieve research independence. The key innovation is that this study will be the first to
combine CETA with Life-Steps and evaluate its preliminary efficacy in a low- or middle-income country setting.
The resulting preliminary data will also support a compelling R01 application, to be submitted in year 4 of the
K23 award period, to test the adapted CETA plus Life-Steps intervention in a fully-powered, multi-site efficacy
study in Ukraine. If successful, the proposed research will have significant public health impact by providing an
evidence-based intervention for treating mental health problems among PWH, with attendant implications for
addressing the dual mental health crisis and HIV epidemic in PWH populations throughout Eastern Europe."

Structural insights from our recent work provide a strong scientific premise for exploring the membrane-related
components of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), including the membrane proximal external region (MPER),
the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic tail (CT), for vaccine development. Our data indicate
that all these regions influence the stability and antigenicity of the Env ectodomain. Major broadly neutralizing
antibody (bnAb) epitopes on HIV-1 Env include CD4 binding site, V1V2-glycan, V3-glycan, the fusion
peptide/gp120-gp41 interface and the MPER. The optimal presentation of these epitopes, critical for their
antigenicity and immunogenicity, depends on the Env trimer organization and conformation. Recently, the fusion
peptide-based immunogens have induced robust cross-clade neutralizing responses in animal models,
suggesting that bnAbs may be elicited by vaccination. In this research project, our central hypothesis is that
rationally designed HIV-1 Env immunogens in different conformations with various degrees of bnAb epitope
exposure induce different B cell responses, which may lead to production of diverse bnAbs in animal models
and to new strategies for HIV-1 vaccine immunogen design. The research team is formed by a group of
outstanding investigators with diverse yet complementary expertise to carry out the proposed studies. This group
has extensive experience in protein engineering, production and characterization, in B cell biology and
vaccinology in animal models, and in detailed analysis of vaccine-elicited antibody responses. The group
members have an extensive history of working together on HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 related projects. The team
will capitalize on the newly determined structures of the membrane-related components of HIV-1 Env to develop
two innovative immunogen-design strategies: (1) soluble Env trimer immunogens and (2) membrane-bound
intact Env trimer immunogens. We propose two Specific Aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1. We will design,
characterize and produce Env-based immunogens in both the protein and mRNA forms and perform structural
studies of Env-based immunogens and their complexes with antibodies. Aim 2. We will evaluate immunogenicity
of novel Env-based protein immunogens and mRNA vaccines in VelocImmune human antibody mice."
10763811,"Project Summary
NK cells are capable of killing virus-infected and cancer cells and, therefore, play an important role in innate
host defense. Unlike cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), whose cytolytic activity is induced by productive TCR
engagement with cognate pMHC ligands, activation of NK cells is regulated by a set of activating and inhibitory
receptors. The net result of the signals induced by these receptors determines the extent of NK cell effector
activities such as INF-γ production and granule-mediated cytotoxicity. One of the main mechanisms of NK cell-
mediated cytolytic activity depends on antibodies and is termed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC). ADCC is induced by FcγRIIIa (CD16) receptors that do not directly recognize antigens on the target
cells, but interact with Fc fragments of IgG antibodies specifically bound to the antigens on the surface of target
cells. Available evidence, including ours, strongly suggests that ligand-mediated clustering of activating
receptors on cytotoxic lymphocytes regulates kinetics of intracellular signaling, formation of a highly ordered
synaptic interface, kinetics of granule delivery, and efficiency of target cell lysis (1-6). The receptor clustering
can be further modulated by antigen co-clustering with other membrane ligands on target cells, which interact
with inhibitory receptors or adhesion molecules on the surface of NK cells. We hypothesize that differences
in FcγRIIIa (CD16) clustering/co-clustering could have significant impact on receptor-mediated
signaling influencing efficiency of ADCC. Thus, the goal of this project is to study how homotypic and
heterotypic ligand clustering regulates ability of the ligands to cooperate in the engagement of CD16, inhibitory
receptors and adhesion molecules to modulate efficiency of ADCC. We will use well-characterized CD16.NK92
cells that we have developed to model functions of NK cells (7-12) and freshly activated human NK cells to
investigate the role of CD16 clustering/co-clustering with other receptors. To achieve this goal, we will exploit
fluorescent nanoparticles (NiNLPs) that can be loaded with ligands for CD16, adhesion molecules, and
inhibitory receptors at various ratios and densities, and will examine the binding kinetics of these model
membrane clusters to NK cells as well as the kinetics of induced intracellular Ca2+ signaling. We will also
utilize planar lipid bilayers presenting the same ligands, either dispersed in the bilayers or co-localized by
cross-linking with the iDimerize system, and will analyze how cross-linking of the ligands will influence structure
of the synaptic interface and the kinetics of NK cell degranulation. The expected results will provide
significantly improved understanding of the mechanisms controlling cytolytic activity of primary and activated
human NK cells to design new NK cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies to improve efficiency of ADCC to
treat viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer."
10763898,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infects over 90% of adults worldwide and initially establishes infection in the oral cavity,
including tonsillar B cells. Upon infecting naïve B cells, EBV expresses viral proteins including EBV Nuclear
Antigens (EBNAs), transcriptional co-activators that promote B cell maturation and establish latently infected
memory B cell reservoirs. EBV-associated malignancies include infectious mononucleosis, and, in immune
compromised hosts, tumorigenesis including lymphomas. Recently, it has been appreciated that EBV induces
metabolic changes upon infection. Our lab has discovered that EBV upregulates oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) in order to promote cell proliferation and avoid arrest. Similarly, naïve B cells also require increased
OXPHOS upon activation by antigen in order to undergo germinal center remodeling and produce memory B
cells. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which EBV alters
OXPHOS, which will enhance our understanding of EBV requirements for latency, and the role of metabolism in
B cell maturation. Intriguingly, the viral protein EBNA-Leader Protein (EBNA-LP) is required for infection of naïve
B cells, but not memory B cells – although the essential role of EBNA-LP is not well characterized. Our
preliminary data suggests the viral protein EBNA-Leader Protein (EBNA-LP) may be essential in upregulation
OXPHOS through transcriptional co-activation of metabolic genes. Our data suggests that EBNA-LP binds
transcription factors that regulate expression of OXPHOS-related genes including NRF1, ERRα, and YY1 and
then recruits chromatin remodeling factors such as P300. This mechanism of transcriptional co-activation mimics
the PGC family of proteins, which uses leucine-rich motifs to bind the same OXPHOS transcription factors and
recruit remodelers. Our preliminary data supports this model in that EBNA-LP contains multiple leucine-rich
motifs, which may be required for binding these transcription factors. Additionally, EBNA-LP forms nuclear bodies,
or membraneless organelles, that may be essential for EBNA-LP to regulate transcription, including OXPHOS
genes. Our preliminary data suggests that EBNA-LP contains a post-translational modification, hydroxyproline,
which promotes protein oligomerization and higher order structures in modified substrates such as collagen.
Therefore, I propose that hydroxyprolination of EBNA-LP is required to form EBNA-LP nuclear bodies and co-activate transcription. My overall hypothesis is that EBNA-LP induces transcription of OXPHOS genes by using
leucine-rich motifs to mimic the cellular PGC family of proteins, and through forming nuclear bodies upon
hydroxyprolination. In Aim 1, I will assess the role of leucine-rich motifs in mediating transcription of OXPHOS
genes and upregulation of cellular OXPHOS in tonsillar B cells. In Aim 2, I will determine the role of
hydroxyprolination of EBNA-LP in formation of nuclear bodies and metabolic regulation in infected cells. These
studies will elucidate novel mechanisms by which a viral protein regulates transcription and B cell metabolism
and will provide insight towards understanding EBV-related malignancies."
10763899,"Scrub typhus is an emerging and potentially fatal global health threat. Approximately one million new cases are
reported annually. The etiologic agent is Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects
leukocytes and endothelial cells resulting in vascular collapse, organ failure, and death. Treatment options are
limited and no preventative vaccine exists. The success of O. tsutsugamushi as a pathogen lies in its ability to
modulate host immunity and other pathways. The responsible mechanisms are unknown, highlighting the need
for a better understanding of scrub typhus host-pathogen interactions. The ankyrin repeat (AR) is a protein-
protein interaction motif that is prevalent throughout nature. O. tsutsugamushi has one of the largest arsenals of
AR-containing effectors (Anks) among bacteria and expresses all of them during infection, underscoring their
importance for intracellular survival and virulence. Most Orientia Anks carry a C-terminal F-box motif that co-opts
host ubiquitin ligases. We discovered that O. tsutsugamushi Ank1 and Ank6 impede the NF-κB pathway in an
AR- and F-box-dependent manner. Both bind and prevent the degradation of host NF-κB inhibitor, p105. Ank1
and Ank6 ARs mimic those of EPRAP, a host protein that stabilizes p105, and ubiquitinate Crybg3, a host kinase
that influences p105 stability. Further screening revealed that a total of 13 Anks antagonize NF-κB, some of
which bind p105 and others do not. Thus, multiple Anks inhibit NF-κB by distinct, overlapping mechanisms. We
found that O. tsutsugamushi lowers MHC-I levels by orchestrating proteasomal degradation of NLRC5, a
transactivator of MHC-I gene expression, and linked this phenomenon to Ank5. How Ank1, Ank5, and Ank6
inhibit innate and adaptive immunity is poorly characterized. We established that Orientia Anks alter the host cell
ubiquitome, but the extent of this strategy, identity of modified targets, and infection outcomes are unexplored.
Finally, other Anks target unknown eukaryotic pathways that also likely influence O. tsutsugamushi pathobiology.
To fill these knowledge gaps, we will decipher the mechanisms by which Anks inhibit NF-κB and use two
innovative screens that circumvent O. tsutsugamushi genetic intractability as part of our approach (Aim 1);
dissect how Ank5 promotes NLRC5 degradation to block MHC-I expression (Aim 2); and identify new host cell
pathways and ubiquitome changes that Anks modulate (Aim 3). The contribution of each newly discovered host-
Ank interaction to O. tsutsugamushi pathogenesis will be interrogated. Overall, we will advance fundamental
understanding of O. tsutsugamushi-host interactions, define novel mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens
modulate immunity, identify new scrub typhus therapeutic targets, and benefit the bourgeoning concept of
designed AR proteins as biomedicals to have a broad and powerful impact."

As of 2021, over 38 million individuals are living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Currently,
there is no cure for HIV, and these individuals are subjected to life-long, oral drug therapy. Highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the standard treatment regimen comprising a cocktail of several antiretroviral
drugs. HAART has made remarkable strides in controlling viral loads, reducing transmission, and preventing the
onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for patients with access to treatment. However, the long-
term effectiveness of HAART remains threatened due to drug resistance. Therefore, developing novel
antiretroviral drugs with different mechanisms of action (MOA) is required to improve therapeutic options. Of all
approved antiretrovirals, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is one of the most frequently targeted enzymes in
the virus. The primary role of RT is to convert the single-strand viral RNA genome into double-strand DNA
(dsDNA) for host-genome integration. Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI) are one of the FDA-approved
classes of antiretroviral often included in HAART. It stops the formation of the viral dsDNA by binding to RT at a
distinct hydrophobic pocket (NNIBP) in proximity but not overlapping the enzyme’s polymerase active site. JT-
4-173 (JT) is a novel potent HIV-1 specific inhibitor previously identified in the Sarafianos lab. A recent structural
study in our lab revealed that JT binds to the NNIBP, yet it does not inhibit normal polymerization. Our preliminary
data showed that JT has no significant impact on early nor late-stage RT products, but the number of integrated
proviruses significantly reduced. This behavior was not observed in any of the currently known NNRTIs. I
hypothesize that JT inhibits the polymerization activity required for strand displacement synthesis, an essential
step in late-stage reverse transcription for the complete formation of the dsDNA. In the proposal, I aim to
determine the impact of JT on early-, intermediate- and late-reverse transcription products along with 1- and 2-
long terminal repeat (LTR) circles and integrated provirus (Aim 1.1), the exact stopping site(s) of reverse
transcription by JT using sequencing techniques (Aim 1.2), and the impact of JT on HIV-1 RT in strand
displacement synthesis using a primer-extension biochemical assay (Aim 1.3). To determine the molecular
mechanism of JT, I will use cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to solve the HIV-1 RT/JT structures in
complex with dsDNA substrates relevant to sites of strand displacement (Aim 2.1), then identify and mutate the
key interactive residues on RT to confirm its effect on strand displacement synthesis using the primer-extension
assay (Aim 2.2). These studies will reveal JT’s exact impact on HIV-1 reverse transcription and elucidate the
unique MOA of a novel NNRTI. I will take full advantage of our lab’s background in RT biology and our
collaborators’ specialties in structural, sequencing, and biochemical studies to complete these proposed
experiments and advance my training. These planned studies will not only lay the foundation for developing a
novel antiretroviral but will also improve our understanding of HIV-1 RT biology."

physiological process to optimal times of day. Understanding the molecular circuitry keeping
circadian time provides insight into how the clock drives overt rhythms and what to fix when the
circadian system is disrupted (i.e. during shift work). Circadian time coded in the rhythmic
regulation of “clock gene” expression in a negative feedback loop system. Critical to this timing
system is the circadian degradation of rhythmically abundant clock proteins, however, these
mechanisms have remained elusive. We have begun elucidating these mechanisms by
developing a novel functional screening approach designed to identify which E3 ubiquitin
ligases degrade which clock proteins.
 The first screen hit we have recovered, Siah2, has revealed remarkable and unexpected
new insights into both clock function by uncovering the unexpected existence of female-specific
circadian mechanisms that control metabolism specifically in females. Unfortunately, the vast
majority of circadian data available are from male mice; thus, we have broadly started to
compare how the circadian system differs between males and females, and across the 4-day
estrus cycle (a huge potential but unstudied influence), in mice. Our studies in the liver so far
have revealed substantial sex-differences in the landscape of genes regulated across the day
between the sexes, and across the estrus-cycle. Furthermore, we have discovered that Siah2
also appears to regulate the circadian clock in several tissues an estrus-cycle dependent
manner (i.e., only on the day(s) prior ovulation), providing strong evidence that circadian clock
systems have highly sex-specific roles. Therefore, our goals for the next 5 years are to continue
filling in the gaps that exist in female circadian biology by further identifying the
differences/similarities between the sexes, leverage Siah2 as a tool to understand what these
mechanisms do, and why they are different. Understanding sex-differences in circadian clock
functions will be critical as the field develops circadian-based therapeutics."

 The pairing of homologous chromosomes is a fundamental process for meiotic recombination but also
occurs in non-meiotic cells in a broad range of organisms. Recent studies have revealed that non-meiotic
homolog pairing is an actively regulated process and provides an opportunity for interchromosomal interaction.
The local pairing status of a particular gene locus differs in a cell type-specific manner and correlates with local
chromatin states, suggesting the possibility that non-meiotic homolog pairing may take part in gene regulation.
 Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) constantly divide asymmetrically to produce one GSC and
one differentiating gonialblast (GB). In this system, stem cell-specific genes, including Signal transducer and
activator of transcription 92E (Stat92E), are quickly downregulated, providing an excellent model to study
preprogrammed changes of gene expression states in vivo. Results from the previous funding periods showed
that the homologous regions of Stat92E always closely associate with each other in GSCs (paired) but separate
immediately in GBs (unpaired), and the change in pairing states is required for prompt downregulation of Stat92E
transcription. It has been shown that GSCs tend to retain old histones H3 and H4, while GBs tend to inherit
newly-synthesized histones H3 and H4. When this histone inheritance was compromised by expressing non-
phosphorylatable histone H3T3A, the change in Stat92E pairing upon differentiation did not occur, raising the
exciting possibility that the pairing states of key genes are epigenetically programmed through the inheritance of
old vs. new histones. These observations suggested that the non-meiotic homologous pairing may be a process
to reprogram gene activity, and that the alteration of pairing states is an important mechanism that regulates key
genes during stem-cell differentiation.
 In this proposal, we aim to define the role of interchromosomal interaction in non-meiotic stages of
germline on cell fate determination and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. First, we will identify a list of
genes differently paired in GSC and GB. Next, we will characterize genome-wide homolog interaction in GSCs
and differentiating cells. Lastly, we will investigate mechanisms by which changes in pairing state influence
transcription using Stat92E and other identified genes. These experiments will allow us to understand how
pairing is developmentally regulated and how it impacts cell fate determination.
 Homologous allelic pairing also occurs in mammalian stem cells, where alleles of Oct4 transiently pair to
share repressive chromatin marks during the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment. Thus these
proposed studies of pairing regulation may elucidate common mechanisms of stem cell differentiation."
10764764,"The ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are a family of six small, Ras-like GTPases best known for
their roles in membrane trafficking, where they control the formation of carrier vesicles at
multiple intracellular sites. Over the years, we have defined roles for ARFs and their regulators
(GEF and GAPs) in multiple cellular processes including endocytosis and post-endocytic
trafficking, and integration of ARF function with Rho family GTPases in the control of actin
cytoskeleton dynamics. More recently we have focused our attention on a subfamily of ARF
GEFs comprising three members, IQSec1, IQSec2 and IQSec3, that are unique among the 15
human ARF GEFs in their sensitivity to calcium signaling. We previously reported that IQSec2
controls the postsynaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurons in response to
calcium influx and defined the molecular basis for mutations in IQSec1 identified in patients
with X-linked intellectual disability. Among the 3 IQSecs, only IQSec1 is ubiquitously expressed.
We determined that IQSec1 controls the trafficking of integrins in non-neuronal cells,
specifically in the disassembly of focal adhesions during cell migration. In this context, we found
that IQSec1 forms a complex with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, that translocates to
ER/plasma membrane contact sites immediately adjacent to focal adhesions, in response to
calcium influx via STIM/Orai1 calcium channels. This was the first demonstration that ER/PM
contacts are essential for adhesion disassembly. We determined that ORP3 has at least two
functions at contact sites – it extracts the plasma membrane phosphoinositide PI4P in exchange
for ER-derived phosphatidylcholine, while also allosterically activating IQSec1, driving
downstream activation of the ARF isoform ARF5. Both lipid exchange and ARF5 activation are
essential for adhesion turnover, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Deciphering
these mechanisms will be the focus of this R35 proposal. Preliminary data indicate that
microtubules, which contact focal adhesions and are necessary for disassembly, are
mistargeted in ORP3-deficient cells. Whether this is due to failure of lipid exchange or ARF5
activation will be investigated, as will the underlying mechanisms. Goals of the project include
identification of novel ARF5 effector proteins that function in this process, defining the
mechanisms through which insertion of PC into the PM leads to adhesion disassembly and
defining the relative roles and possible integration of ORP3/IQSec1 with other proteins that
concentrate at ER/PM contacts."
10765278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-translational modifications of the histone proteins that package DNA play a central role in regulating
transcription and repair of DNA damage. The goal of this research program is to determine the molecular
mechanism by which attachment of the small protein, ubiquitin, to histone proteins functions in concert with
modifications including methylation and acetylation to regulate gene expression. Since misregulation of histone
ubiquitination and methylation characterizes many cancers, the results of these studies can be used to design
new drugs that target the molecular machines involved in these pathways. A major focus will be on the
mechanisms by which histone H2B-K120 monoubiquitination orchestrates multiple events during transcription
that result in gene activation. A multidisciplinary approach combining cryo-electron microscopy, x-ray
crystallography, solution biochemistry and cell-based approaches will be used to study the mechanism by
which ubiquitin is specifically attached to histone H2B during transcription and the distinct mechanisms by
which different deubiquitinating enzymes distinguish between H2B in intact versus partially disassembled
nucleosomes. We will also determine the nature of intra- and inter-nucleosomal cross-talk between histone
ubiquitination, methylation and acetylation mediated by transcriptional activators that act downstream of H2B
ubiquitination. Building upon the recent discovery of first-in-class macrocyclic inhibitors of the human SAGA
H2B deubiquitinating enzyme, we will determine their mechanism of action and derive principles that will drive
further drug discovery of multi-subunit deubiquitinating enzymes. To elucidate the molecular basis by which
H2B ubiquitination drives cell proliferation in MLL-rearranged leukeumia, we will uncover the role of histone
ubiquitination in stimulating the activity of MLL1 fusion complexes that result from chromosomal
rearrangements. The molecular insights that will result from the proposed studies will provide a foundation for
developing new chemotherapies that target cancers for which there currently are no effective treatments."
10783730,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leads to bone loss by activating osteoclasts (OCs) to resorb bone while suppressing
the ability of osteoblasts (OBs) to build bone. Importantly, patients with RA develop systemic
osteopenia/osteoporosis that is not well controlled by current therapeutic agents. Therefore, it is critical to
develop new agents that are anabolic for bone in the setting of inflammatory arthritis. Previously, we identified
the adaptor protein Schnurri-3 (SHN3) as a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Mice lacking SHN3 develop a
progressive increase in bone mass, as SHN3 deletion enhances OB function. Intriguingly, RA patients express
SHN3 in cells within inflamed synovium and in serum, and SHN3 expression is induced in vitro in OBs and in
synoviocytes (FLS) isolated from RA patients in response to the RA-associated cytokines TNF and IL-17A.
Notably, our preliminary data show that SHN3-deficiency can protect from inflammation-induced bone loss in
vitro and in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of SHN3 is an attractive mechanism to promote bone formation to
treat the local and systemic bone loss that accompanies RA. Finally, we have developed a bone-specific
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) that targets SHN3 and could prevent or treat bone loss in RA.
Aim 1 will test whether SHN3-deficiency can limit the development of osteoporosis and bone erosion in a TNF-
induced RA model by augmenting OB function, and can promote healing of articular erosions in a serum transfer-
induced arthritis model. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that SHN3-deficiency in OBs prevents the
suppression of osteogenesis by the RA-associated cytokines TNF and IL-17A, while its deficiency in FLS
suppresses production of inflammatory cytokines and WNT antagonists that lead to inhibition of OB
differentiation. Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanisms by which SHN3 deficiency protects from
inflammation-induced suppression of osteogenesis to identify novel targets promoting bone formation. We will
examine how the RA-associated cytokines TNF and IL-17A induce upregulation of SHN3 transcripts via the NF-
kB pathway and stabilization of phosphorylated SHN3 via the ERK MAPK pathway, resulting in suppression of
the WNT/b-catenin pathway and OB differentiation. Aim 3 will determine whether bone-specific rAAV-mediated
silencing of SHN3 in vivo prevents inflammation-induced bone loss in RA. Systemic bone loss and articular
erosion will be quantified in mouse models of RA treated with the bone-specific rAAV carrying a SHN3 silencer.
Transcriptomic profiling will be performed in AAV-transduced OB-lineage cells isolated from RA mouse models
to identify potential molecular effectors in the SHN3 pathway that promote healing of inflammation-induced bone
loss. Successful completion of this work will provide proof-of-principle that SHN3-deficiency can
augment bone formation at sites of inflammation-induced bone loss in RA. Understanding how SHN3
inhibition protects from suppression of OB differentiation in this setting and identifying potential novel
regulators in the SHN3 pathway should provide important therapeutic targets for inflammatory arthritis."

Immune epitopes--the portions of an antigen that are recognized by antibodies and T-cell receptors--are key to
understanding healthy and abnormal immune responses. The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is a freely
available resource funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that catalogs
experimental data on more than one million antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human
primates, and other animal species in the context of infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity and
transplantation. As well, there is a wealth of information captured in other biomedical databases that could
potentially be applied to immunological research. The goal of this work is to integrate immune epitope
information from IEDB with the wealth of additional biomedical data in humans and model organisms, thereby
enabling novel opportunities for hypothesis generation and discovery. We will seamlessly connect epitopes to
the protein information in UniProtKB, which contains rich functional annotation and the means to display
protein sequence features, and the Protein Ontology (PRO), which provides orthology information and the
explicit representation of proteoforms. We will make further connections to resources specializing in protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein-protein interactions, human genetic variation, diseases, and
drugs. Display of this information in the UniProt ProtVista environment and via the IEDB website will make it
easily accessible to the large community of immunology and disease researchers. Our work will enable novel
queries of high interest to translational researchers, such as: (1) What PTMs and/or genetic variants overlap
with an epitope of interest? Identification of such overlaps can provide insight into factors that affect
auto-antigenicity or immune evasion by pathogens; (2) Is a human epitope of interest found in
orthologous/homologous proteins in model organisms or vice-versa? This will allow researchers interested in
human disease to fully exploit knowledge derived from model organisms, and conversely, improve disease
models in non-human organisms. It will also enable identification of potential cross-reactivities within and
across organisms; and (3) Are there any druggable targets among the proteins that interact with autoantigenic
proteins associated with an autoimmune disease of interest? This work entails the following specific aims: (i)
Aim 1. Data exchange: Guided by use cases, we will connect epitopes within IEDB to data from PRO, UniProt,
and other informatics resources; (ii) Aim 2. Information access: Guided by user input, we will enhance
navigation, data visualization, and application interfaces at each resource and create connections between
them; and (iii) Aim 3. Community engagement: We will build community awareness of the connected resources
and ensure that the needs of stakeholders are reflected. This collaborative effort among multiple major
resources will overcome barriers to consumption of IEDB data, thereby supporting inquiry into the role of the
immune system in human disease."

Social isolation (SI) during childhood increases the susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety
disorders, depression, and cognitive impairments. Limited treatment for these disorders highlights the
importance of identifying new therapeutic targets. Recent evidence has underscored the role of the cerebellum
in early-life stress. For example, the neonatal cerebellum contains the highest level of glucocorticoid receptor
(GR) in the entire brain, indicating that the cerebellum is enriched in the molecular machinery for processing the
stress response. The cerebellum is extensively connected to brain networks that are sensitive to psychological
stress. However, whether and how SI stress regulates gene expression in the cerebellum to result in cerebellar
dysfunction and maladaptive behaviors remain elusive. To address the knowledge gap, we isolated experimental
mice in singly housed cages. They displayed behavioral changes reminiscent of high anxiety, depression, and
social memory loss. Moreover, we found that SI impaired intrinsic excitability of Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole
output neurons in the cerebellar cortex. And cerebellar gene expression was highly responsive to stress stimuli
such as an elevation of corticosterone, a stress hormone, in rodents. These findings fuel our central hypothesis
that SI impairs the cerebellar output activity by specifically affecting the intrinsic excitability of PCs; and restoring
PC excitability rectifies SI-caused behavioral deficits via the cerebello-cortical networks. To test the hypothesis,
we propose a multidisciplinary approach with three specific aims: (1) Determine the molecular basis of reduced
PC intrinsic excitability by SI. We will employ two genome-wide RNA sequencing techniques to obtain an
unbiased view of transcriptional signatures and epigenetic modifications of SI as well as to identify SI-responsive
ion channels in PCs, e.g., Kv1.5. PC-specific knockout of GR will uncover the GR-dependent genomic
reprogramming by SI. (2) Define the significance of PC activity in systemic response to SI. Using viral gene
transfer, we will gain precise spatiotemporal control of PC excitability to test the necessity and sufficiency of
cerebellar activity in mediating the system-wide response to SI. (3) Specify the cerebellum-cortex gateways
underlying maladaptive behaviors of SI. Our efforts will be focused on dissecting the neural circuits that connect
the cerebellum to the downstream sub/cortical areas and their contributions to the behavioral phenotypes of SI.
Completion of this work will advance our understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuitry mechanisms
underpinning the non-conventional role of the cerebellum in the stress response, and the results will ultimately
help develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve mental health."
10783555,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase with many important
effects, including putative anti-aging actions. AMPK plays a key role in the control of glucose uptake by skeletal
muscle, the tissue that accounts for up to 85% of insulin-induced blood glucose clearance. Insulin resistance
for muscle glucose uptake is an essential defect for type 2 diabetes and linked to many of the most prevalent
and devastating age-related pathologies, including cardiovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction. Caloric
restriction (CR; reducing calorie intake 20-40% below ad libitum intake) enhances insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake in muscle of old rats. The broad, long-term goal of this project is to advance understanding of
mechanisms to improve insulin sensitivity, leading to healthy aging. The Specific Aims are: 1) To determine CR
effects on key allosteric regulators of AMPK, and on the activation of AMPK in selected subcellular
compartments of skeletal muscle from older rats; and 2) To ascertain aldometanib (a recently discovered
AMPK activator) effects on older rat skeletal muscle subcellular localization of AMPK T172 phosphorylation,
glucose uptake, cell surface GLUT4 localization, and key signaling proteins. CR by older rats leads to greater
phosphorylation of AMPK on the key regulatory T172 site (pAMPKThr172) concomitant with greater
phosphorylation of multiple AMPK substrates in muscle independent of changes in muscle ATP or AMP, the
major allosteric regulators of AMPK. Because conventional mechanisms cannot explain these striking results,
this project will probe non-canonical mechanisms, including the muscle concentration of fructose-1, 6-
bisphosphate that increases pAMPKThr172 by an AMP-independent mechanism. AMPK resides in multiple
compartmentalized pools, and spatial regulation of AMPK is a crucial determinant of function, yet no earlier CR
research analyzed compartmentalized AMPK activation. Accordingly, CR effects on subcellular localization of
pAMPKThr172 and phosphorylation of AMPK substrates will be evaluated. Although CR improves insulin
sensitivity, its widespread adoption by humans is unrealistic. Identification of safe and effective alternative
interventions is essential. A novel aldolase inhibitor (aldometanib) selectively increased lysosomal pAMPKThr172
without altering pAMPKThr172 in other subcellular locations, and also without altering the concentrations of AMP
or ATP in cultured cells. Because the specific mechanisms whereby aldometanib elevates glucose uptake are
unknown, this project will determine aldometanib’s effects on subcellular localization of pAMPKThr172, GLUT4
transporter translocation, and regulation of key signaling proteins that regulate glucose uptake in the skeletal
muscle of older rats. This study will challenge conventional wisdom about CR’s regulation of AMPK, and reveal
valuable insights into a promising, new AMPK activator’s mechanisms and actions on muscle glucose uptake."

 The overall goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the cellular functions of
transcription factor isoforms. Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression and as
such play key roles in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. The human
genome is estimated to harbor ~1600 TF genes; however, most of these are expressed as a series of protein
isoforms arising from mRNAs with alternative starts, ends, or splicing. Though a handful of alternative TF
isoforms are known to play functionally important (and distinct) roles in the cell, the overwhelming majority—
thousands of proteins—remain entirely uncharacterized. Moreover, splicing aberrations are a hallmark of
cancer, and mis-expression of TF isoforms can contribute to tumorigenesis. Thus, decoding the roles of TF
isoforms is key to a systems-level understanding of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in development and
disease. In my previous work, I found widespread changes in DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, and
transcriptional activation in exogenous assays across a collection of >700 TF isoforms. These results
underscore the need to perturb and characterize TF isoforms in their endogenous cellular context to truly
understand their roles in GRNs.
 Functional genomics approaches such as high throughput perturbation screens have revolutionized our
understanding of gene functions. I aim to apply and extend these functional genomics approaches to
study isoforms, which have remained elusive due to technical limitations. I propose to use a combination of
state-of-the-art genomic technologies to decode the functions of TF isoforms in breast cancer cells. I will
leverage long read RNA-sequencing to perform rigorous isoform-aware analyses (Aim 1) and isoform-specific
high throughput experiments (Aims 2 and 3). In Aim 1, I will re-analyze existing CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out
databases from the Cancer Dependency Map Consortium to identify candidate isoform-specific phenotypes in
breast cancer. In Aim 2, I will establish a platform for robust and specific knock-down of individual isoforms in
mammalian cells using RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas systems. In Aim 3, I will use tunable libraries of TF ORFs
to quantitatively tune isoform expression across a range of physiological levels. The proposed work includes
technology development in the mentored K99 phase, which I will then leverage during the independent R00
phase to probe the mechanisms of TF isoform function in breast cancer via single-cell screening approaches.
 Successful execution of these aims will begin to decode the “dark matter” of alternative TF isoforms,
laying a foundation for future studies of alternative isoforms more broadly. By combining new training in high-
throughput screening approaches during the K99 phase with my existing expertise in gene regulation, TF
biology, and bioinformatics, this transition to independence award will position me well to start my own
research group that uses interdisciplinary genomic methods to probe GRNs in development and disease."

the often dire consequences of an RD. Despite the UDN’s comprehensive diagnostic approach, 70% of
patients remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic strategies. The diagnostic approach at
the UDN currently relies on manual extraction of RD phenotypes from clinical notes in electronic health records
(EHR), which is laborious and time-consuming. A promising alternative is to leverage natural language
processing (NLP) models, which can automatically extract fine-grained RD phenotypes from clinical notes, to
support timely diagnosis at the UDN. Existing general NLP models, however, are not suitable for supporting
diagnosis at the UDN. Furthermore, NLP models have limited impact on diagnosis due to scarce infrastructure
for delivering them to the clinic, highlighting the need to bridge the implementation gap between NLP and
practice. Even after diagnosis, patients often undergo therapeutic odysseys. Despite advancements in gene
therapy, evidence shows that genetics alone do not account for the wide diversity in RD phenotypes.
Exposures also play a critical role, but less is known about how their causal effects vary across individuals.
This knowledge gap underscores the need to elucidate the complex phenome-genome-exposome interplay on
an individual-level basis, which is crucial in informing personalized disease management strategies. The
overall objective of this proposal is to develop and implement advanced statistical machine learning
(ML) methods aimed at shortening RD odysseys. During the K99 phase, I will develop a novel NLP system
to extract RD phenotypes from clinical notes (Aim 1) and implement it using REDCap at the Vanderbilt UDN
(Aim 2). During the R00 phase, I will leverage phenomic, genomic, and exposomic data from All of Us and
build a causal inference framework that uses modern statistical ML techniques to estimate personalized causal
effects of exposures on RD phenotypes (Aim 3). The expected outcomes are a novel, open-source NLP
system for RDs, an implementation framework using REDCap to support timely diagnosis at the Vanderbilt
UDN, and an advanced, reproducible causal inference framework to elucidate the complex phenome-genome-
exposome interplay underlying RDs on an individual-level basis. During the K99 phase, the PI will be mentored
by experts in NLP, REDCap, EHR phenotyping, and RDs at Vanderbilt, and develop competencies in those
areas. This proposal will yield results for subsequent studies on data-driven approaches aimed at shortening
RD odysseys. This award will provide the necessary training to supplement the PI’s expertise in statistical ML
and causal inference and help her transition into an independent career in biomedical data science."

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is a major problem in urban areas, with illicit
drug use, incarceration, unstable housing, and geographic area of residence each being associated with CA-
MRSA risk. Using genomic sequencing, we have previously demonstrated that community networks may
facilitate the spread of MRSA outside of households, and epidemiologic exposures, including residence in a
high detainee release area, may serve as the basis for linkages between individuals colonized or infected with
genetically similar MRSA strains. The extent to which jails facilitate MRSA transmission, both during
incarceration and to the community at large, is unknown. Our preliminary data demonstrate a high proportion
of individuals enter the jail already colonized with MRSA and jails then provide an opportunity for at-risk
individuals to intermingle which may promote further spread of MRSA. As urban jails are characterized by high
turnover and high recidivism, we speculate the jails may be one of the major drivers of MRSA spread from and
back into urban communities. Despite the demonstrated risk associated with community settings, studies
examining infection prevention for MRSA have been conducted almost exclusively in hospitals. It is unknown if
transmission dynamics and risk factors for acquisition of MRSA in the community are the same as those that
drive transmission in hospitals. Prior studies of sexually transmitted diseases have demonstrated that
interventions in urban jails can have significant downstream benefits in the community and provide an
opportunity to intervene with a difficult-to-reach population that often lacks access to medical care. We believe
this type of intervention could be extended to MRSA and that molecular epidemiologic analysis would help to
design and maximize the benefits of a community intervention. Funds are requested to examine the genomic
epidemiology of MRSA in an urban community and to identify and characterize epicenters for MRSA spread.
We will use existing MRSA clinical cultures from 2008-2018 and integrate genomic data from these isolates
with geocoding, epidemiologic, detainee release, and US census data to test whether there are geographic
areas at highest risk for MRSA spread. We will use spatial transmission modeling to identify rates of MRSA
transmission within and between community areas and to test hypothetical interventions. The proposal has
three aims: (1) Characterize the movement of MRSA over time to identify if there is differential risk for spread
in various community areas, (2) Determine if community MRSA strains are genomically related to MRSA
strains isolated from individuals incarcerated at the jail, and (3) Identify hotspots of MRSA spread in the
community using population genomics modeling. This innovative project will be the first to track the spread of
MRSA in a large urban area, with results highlighting populations and community areas that may be the best
targets for prevention efforts. Because the study will explore well-documented disparities with CA-MRSA, our
findings will be generalizable to other underserved populations, underscoring the public health importance."

Current stem cell-based treatments for central nervous system (CNS) injuries such as spinal cord injury (SCI),
are severely hampered by poor stem cell survival rates, inefficient integration, loss of neural plasticity, and
uncontrollable differentiation of implanted cells, all of which are caused by the highly inhibitory and inflammatory
microenvironment at disease or injury sites. Specifically, gliosis at the injury site causes the secretion of inhibitory
factors leading to poor axon regeneration and sprouting of surviving neuronal populations, resulting in the
intrinsic limitations of the CNS to regenerate after the initial injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective
strategies to generate a robust population of functional neurons derived from patient-derived stem cells and re-
establish the damaged neural circuitry. To this end, we propose to integrate several fields of research, including
nanotechnology, biomaterials, neuroscience, and stem cell biology, to develop a novel nanoscaffold-based stem
cell assembly platform that allows for the generation of favorable microenvironments during stem cell
implantation and the control of stem cell fate in vivo for potential clinical applications.
 To address the fundamental impediment of regeneration associated with CNS injuries and diseases, we
propose to develop injectable 3D-Hybrid SMART neuro-spheroids for enhanced stem cell therapy and effective
treatment of SCI in vivo. The 3D-Hybrid SMART neuro-spheroids are assembled from biodegradable scaffold
nanomaterials enriched with natural neural ECM to promote neural stem cell (NSC) survival and differentiation.
The SMART neuro-spheroids also permit the loading of a bioactive molecule (i.e., Notch inhibitor), resulting in
the synergy between suppressing neuroinhibitory signaling and promoting neural stem cell (NSC) survival and
differentiation. This novel technology platform will be further integrated into two clinically advanced models: i) an
inflammatory CNS organoid model incorporated with microglia, and ii) a spinal cord injury animal model. This
multidisciplinary study will provide a next-generation platform for research and cell therapy in neuro-regenerative
medicine from the perspective of developing a new 3D spheroid assembly method for enhanced stem cell
survival and suppression of inhibitory environment after CNS injuries.
 We propose to verify our central hypothesis and achieve our objectives by addressing the following specific
aims: AIM #1 – Develop bioactive and biodegradable-nanoscaffold-based injectable 3D-Hybrid SMART
spheroids; AIM #2 – Investigate deep drug (Notch-i) delivery in SMART spheroids and study neuronal
differentiation of stem cells and axonal growth under neuroinhibitory and immune microenvironments
in vitro; AIM #3 – Determine the therapeutic effects of 3D-Hybrid SMART spheroids on the modulation of
neuroinhibitory microenvironments and the enhancement of SCI functional recovery in vivo. Collectively,
we anticipate that our proposed studies will provide an innovative, highly effective, and robust method for
developing therapeutic interventions for neurological disorders."

Bile acid composition contributes strongly to metabolic regulation. The particular subset of bile acids that are
hydroxylated in the carbon 12? position (12HBAs) are negatively regulated by insulin signaling and
synthesized at higher rates in people with insulin resistance. People with low 12HBAs show improvements in
glucose and lipid metabolism, but the mechanisms of these effects are unknown. A longstanding barrier to
progress in understanding the mechanisms by which bile acid composition regulates systemic metabolism has
been the lack of a translationally relevant mouse model. But exciting recent progress in the field has uncovered
mouse models with humanized bile acid composition. In this grant, we will use humanized mice to dissect the
physiologic and molecular mechanisms by which bile acid composition, particularly 12HBAs, regulate lipid and
glucose metabolism. We will examine effects in the liver, the intestine, and the adipose tissue, three key
tissues where 12HBAs may carry out their differential effects. We will complement gold-standard in vivo mouse
studies with ex vivo and in vitro systems to isolate the cell autonomous effects of bile acid composition.
Success of this work will reveal fundamental mechanisms by which bile acid composition regulates metabolic
homeostasis and may inform pharmacologic attempts to specifically reduce 12HBAs for metabolic disease
treatment."

Allograft rejection is characterized by effector CD4+ T cell activation in response to donor antigen and an
intense cellular and humoral attack on the graft. However, multiple intracellular signals within CD4+ T cells
operate co-incidentally to control and regulate effector alloimmunity, and it is proposed that this process of
immunoregulation is a vital and perhaps more potent component of the response. The neuropilin (NRP)
receptors, NRP-1 and NRP-2, are single spanning transmembrane glycoproteins that were initially
discovered as chemorepulsive mediators of axonal guidance. However, they are now recognized to function
in a wide range of important biological processes including migration, angiogenesis, and cell growth. In
addition, they have recently been shown to have pluripotent functions in the immune response as well as in
tumor initiation and progression. Over the past decade, several groups have identified critical functions for
NRP-1 in immunity, notably related to its expression on induced Tregulatory cells where it functions to
augment immunoregulation. In contrast, much less is known about the immunological function of NRP-2
and it has only recently been demonstrated to be expressed on immune cells. In preliminary studies, we find
that NRP-2 is expressed on subsets of both human and murine CD4+ effector and regulatory cells.
Furthermore, we find that Semaphorin3F, a well established ligand for NRP-2, is potent to inhibit PI-3K
activity as well as mTOR signaling that are reported to modulate CD4+ T cell activation. Also, we find that
CD4+ T cells from NRP-2 knockout mice mount enhanced effector responses following activation in vitro
and in vivo. These observations have shaped a working model whereby the induced expression of NRP-2
on CD4+ T cells functions to modulate activation, and they suggest that its biological effects have
consequences for the outcome of the alloimmune response. Our objectives in this R01 are to: 1), identify
how NRP-2 modulates regulatory signaling responses and cell metabolism in CD4+ subsets, 2), evaluate
whether Semaphorin3F serves to regulate CD4+ T cell activation responses, and 3), evaluate whether
Sema3F-NRP-2 interactions can be exploited in vivo to augment immunoregulation post transplantation
and/or to induce Teffector responses that limit cancer growth. We will test the hypothesis that CD4+ T cell
NRP-2 interacts with Semaphorin3F and/or additional ligands to modulate Teffector cell activation and to
augment Tregulatory cell function and immunoregulation following transplantation. We propose two specific
aims in which we will: 1), identify the mechanism of NRP-2-induced regulatory signaling and the
consequences of NRP-2 loss in CD4+ T cell subsets, and 2), determine the function of CD4+ T cell NRP-2 in
the prevention of rejection and in long-term allograft survival. Collectively, these innovative studies will have
broad scientific and biological implications of great significance and relevance in immunity."

Innate behaviors are hard-wired and shared among most mammals, however, it is still not fully understood how
these behaviors arise and what neuronal mechanisms control behavior selection. The goal of this proposal is
to study feeding behavior as a typical innate behavior to determine the fundamentals of a circuit that connects
sensing of the body’s energy state to motor centers for food consumption. This will be done using an
integrative approach at behavior, circuit, neuron and synapse level that takes advantage of my existing
and proposed training in neuroscience. Results will shed light on the neuronal computations that
transform sensations of energy state into motor sequences of chewing and biting and will advance our
understanding of behavior selection.
Feeding behavior is elicited by changes in bodily energy state (fasted vs. fed) that result in jaw movements of
chewing and biting. In contrast to other behaviors, the motor and premotor neurons for jaw muscles are located
in the brain and not the spine. Thus, the arc from hunger sensation to motor control is fully brain-based. I
previously identified a simple circuit for food consumption that connects neurons sensitive to signals of bodily
energy state via only one intermediate node to premotor areas controlling biting and chewing. Building on this
data, the mentored phase aims to delineate the role of premotor neurons and their activity patterns with
respect to the hypothesis that premotor neurons are structured in a motor map for bite purposes. This aim
aligns with my training plan to gain expertise in RNA profiling and single cell calcium imaging through my
advisory committee and the high-quality scientific core and support opportunities at Rockefeller University.
Additionally, I will also take advantage of the career development and lab management training opportunities
offered locally and by the Tri-Institute area. Next, during the independent phase, I will use these skills to
elucidate the computations that lead to the behavior selection of feeding and the effect of internal sensations of
energy state change. Specifically, it will be determined how competing behaviors (social interactions, fear) can
suppress feeding and how integration of food-derived sensations (sight, smell) and bodily signals causes food
consumption. This phase is the logical extension of my extensive training in neuroscience and my career
objectives to lead my own research group for which this proposal forms the basis of my research direction.
Results from this study will shed light on the conceptual principles of how innate behaviors are encoded along
a simple sensory to motor circuit. Additionally, results will also provide insight into the mechanisms of energy
state coupling with food intake which has important implications for obesity and eating disorders. Finally, this
proposal will equip me with the training and initial data needed to start an independent research program that
is different from my mentors and aligned with my career goals of studying innate behavior in the context of
interoception.

 The low number of college graduates from UR groups in Arkansas, together with the small number of UR
students nationally who graduate in the biological sciences, results in a small pool of UR students entering
fields of biomedical research in Arkansas. To address this shortfall, the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences (UAMS) created the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) Program was created in
2009 to specifically provide a comprehensive start-to-finish mentoring and training program that includes 2
years of salary/tuition/fees support for UR students pursuing biomedical PhD degrees. The overall goals and
objectives of the UAMS IMSD Program are (1) to enhance our success in retaining UR students and (2) to
refine strategies to recruit additional UR students. Our specific, measurable objectives are to matriculate 6 UR
doctoral students each year and to graduate 90% of these students. Specific Aim 1 is to matriculate 6 new UR
doctoral students each year. In the year prior to implementation of the IMSD Program (2008), 10 of 91 (11%)
domestic PhD applications were UR students. In the fall of 2022, 24.7% of domestic PhD applications to
GPIBS and Pharmaceutical Sciences at UAMS were from UR students; this shows a significant increase from
previous years. Specific Aim 2 is to retain and graduate 90% of the students in the UAMS IMSD Program. We
will work to retain and graduate IMSD students by providing the preparation and support necessary for student
success. We will provide support in numerous ways. First, we will enhance our PhD Summer Transition
Program for matriculated IMSD doctoral students. The PhD Summer Transition Program will include new
training in biomedical informatics and additional career and professional development workshops, along with
workshops on mentoring, cultural competency, implicit bias, mindfulness, resilience, and health disparities
research. We will create activities to enhance the communication skills of students, implement an Individual
Development Plan (IDP), enhance our team-mentoring plan, and use IMSD students as mentors in a Near-
Peer Mentoring Program. We will continue the peer mentoring program, faculty research seminar series, and
student training on academic portfolios already implemented in the current IMSD program. Lastly, we will
partner with UAMS and other T32 programs to expose IMSD students to training grant opportunities. Specific
Aim 3 is to identify and further improve the program components that contributed to past program success,
and disseminate the results. Program evaluation will be through a logic model, and results will be disseminated
to the UAMS campus and other schools through the website, newsletters, presentations, and publications.
Together, our proposed aims will contribute to the global recruitment, retention, and graduation of UR students
at UAMS, ultimately helping to boost the number of UR faculty and investigators in the biomedical sciences
serving Arkansas and the nation."

The gametes arise either from germ cells or germline stem cells (GSCs), by undergoing differentiation and
meiosis. The gametes help launch the next generation by sustaining early development prior to zygotic
genome activation by contributing specific components to the zygote. In particular, the mature oocyte, in
addition to a haploid genome, contains a “maternal contribution” of RNAs, proteins, complexes, and
organelles that is critical to establish a totipotent zygote. Moreover, the oocyte cytoplasm is also sufficient to
reprogram a quiescent somatic cell nucleus to totipotency. Thus, the oocyte's maternal contribution is
essential and critical for totipotency. Germ cells undergoing differentiation and meiosis to eventually
synthesize maternal contribution is conserved up to human. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that establish this
highly potent oocyte cytoplasm during oogenesis are incompletely understood. Using Drosophila as a model
system, my lab has discovered a germ cell-to-maternal transition, wherein germ cell-specific programs,
such as those that promote GSC self-renewal, differentiation, and entry into meiotic cell cycle, are silenced
once the oocyte is specified. Our work reveals that this silencing of the germ cell program is critical to
establishing the “correct” maternal contribution by excluding transcripts that could interfere with development
of the early embryo. We find that this silencing is is mediated by heterochromatin formation to and removal of
perduring RNAs by RNA degradation pathways. Although, we are beginning to understand how germ cell
specific programs are silenced during the germ cell-to-maternal transition several aspects remain poorly
characterized. The objective of the proposal is to uncover how the germ cell-to-maternal transition is
regulated by addressing the following questions: 1. How do the changes in gene expression during the germ
cell-to-maternal transition relate to reorganization of the genome?, 2. How are germ cell-specific genes
targeted for silencing? and 3. How is silencing of germ cell-specific genes coordinated with oocyte
specification? The rationale for the proposed work identifying regulators of this transition and the underlying
molecular mechanisms could reveal new etiologies and therapies for human infertility and novel concepts in
developmental biology."

Anion channels, active transporters, and lipid scramblases are central players in human physiology. These
integral membrane proteins play key roles in physiology where they control a panoply of processes, ranging from
epithelial salt reabsorption and neuromuscular excitability to blood coagulation, membrane fusion and repair. My
long-term objective is to understand the molecular mechanisms of gating and regulation of two families of
membrane transport proteins, the voltage-gated CLCs and the Ca2+-activated TMEM16s. An unexpectedly
shared property of CLCs and TMEM16s is that they display remarkable functional diversity within conserved
structural frameworks. Whereas both families were originally identified as chloride channels, subsequent work
revealed that many CLCs are H+-coupled active transporters and most TMEM16s are dual-function phospholipid
scramblases and non-selective ion channels. Missense mutations that cause dysfunction in members of both
families cause inheritable disorders of bone, kidney, brain, and muscle. Thus, CLCs and TMEM16s are priority
targets for the development of pharmacological tools to treat these disorders. However, a lack of understanding
of how CLCs and TMEM16s function at the atomic level significantly hinders the development of such tools. For
example, the rational design of compounds to treat these disorders is hampered by the lack of structural
information on the specific conformations stabilized by the gain or loss of function mutations. The overarching
goal of our proposal is to understand at the atomic level how CLCs and TMEM16s are regulated by physiological
stimuli and to elucidate how disease-causing mutations alter their structure-function relationships. To this end,
we will focus on the CLC-1 channel which is mutated in myotonia congenita, a rare muscle disorder, and on the
TMEM16E scramblase, which is mutated in limb girdle muscular dystrophy and in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia,
a rare bone disorder. The limited understanding of the molecular underpinnings of CLC and TMEM16 function
is further underscored by our inability to recognize the molecular origins of the functional divergence that exists
within each of these two families. In this proposal, our team will focus on broadly important questions that pertain
to both CLCs and TMEM16s, such as what are the evolutionary basis of their functional divergence? What are
the molecular steps underlying their activation and regulation by physiological stimuli? How do disease-causing
mutations alter these molecular steps? These projects are timely, within our research abilities, enabled by the
state-of-the-art approaches, and supported by extensive supporting data. We expect that our proposed work will
yield new insights into these fundamental questions and will provide a structural framework to interpret the effects
of disease-causing mutations, which may lead to the development of targeted therapeutics."

The Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics was founded on the principle that pathology is multifactorial, multi-
scalar, and driven by complex interacting dynamics. This proposal builds and applies new predictive medicine
technology that enables multifactorial, multi-scalar data integration to identify disease causes, develop cures,
and optimize patient care. Key knowledge gaps addressed include: 1.) integration of siloed relationships for
interactive literature-based discovery across 33+ million journal articles, including the development of a
comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph software called SemBioSys; 2) high-throughput automated meta-
analysis to quantify effect size across cohorts and scales using a combination of newly developed deep
learning, active learning, interactive weak supervision and human in the loop artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms into a single interactive software; 3) de novo multimodal machine learning algorithms to investigate
multifactorial, multi-scalar disease dynamics; 4) human in the loop methods for enhancing AI accuracy, utility,
and interpretability, which leverages our large test bed of diverse high school and undergraduate curators
acting as subject matter experts. The developed technology will be applied to a bevy of multifactorial diseases
in collaboration with clinicians and experimentalists: neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s Disease, Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease), cancers (adult and pediatric acute and chronic leukemias and solid
tumor cancers), cardiovascular disease, and infectious disease. The significance of this project is integrative
technology to identify and rank novel disease mechanisms, discover and prioritize novel and repurposed
drugs, and to optimally stratify patients for fair and equitable clinical trials that minimize health outcome
disparities. The innovation includes new integrative biomedical natural language processing (NLP), multimodal
machine learning, and dynamic disease modeling and event sequencing algorithms that can be generalized to
all of medicine."
10767923,"SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Communities that are exposed to metals often have limited resources, partnerships, and scientific knowledge
that will aid in mitigating the impact of these metals on later-life health risks. Such limitations challenge the
ability to prioritize, and mitigate community-relevant exposure pathways and possible health risks. An
approach based on bi-directional communication and problem-solving, citizen science, and provision of
practical mitigation systems through a co-implemented intervention could provide lasting value to affected
communities. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will serve a critical role in the MEMCARE-SRC by
developing a partnership between local residents and stakeholders in rural and urban communities with our
SRC team members and trainees to understand community needs and enhance broad understanding of
metals and metals mixtures, identify exposure pathways and mitigation approaches, and promote education
and public policy to characterize risk and empower community members as advocates of their own health
around metals exposures. CEC’s rural community partnership is based in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, which
is affected by the Nelson Tunnel/Commodore Waste Pile and Summitville mine Superfund sites. In both areas,
groundwater and soil are contaminated with a variety of metals, including arsenic, cadmium, manganese, lead,
and chromium. CEC’s urban community partnership is based at Dimock Community Health Center (DCHC) in
the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, MA. DCHC provides care for individuals living in the surrounding
community, which is challenged with household metal exposures, a high burden of environmental metal
exposures, and high poverty rates. The CEC will: 1) identify concerns of pregnant women regarding exposures
to toxic metals in their community and the impact on offspring health; 2) lead a citizen science effort to
collaboratively collect and assess individual metal and metal mixture levels from drinking water and soil
samples as well as urine and toenails of pregnant women and children from urban and rural communities; and
3) co-implement a remediation intervention using commercially available water filters and innovative new
MEMCARE-SRC developed technologies to reduce community metal exposures, with effectiveness tested by
participating community members. The CEC will use methods and technologies to detect hazardous
substances in the environment as part of a community-based approach to assess and mitigate the risks of
these substances to human health. The CEC is one of the most fundamentally integrated components of the
MEMCARE-SRC as it will partner closely in the research of all for SRC research projects and establish lasting
and productive partnerships with the community, including routine evaluation of this partnership to ensure bi-
directional exchange to provide the community with key information about metal exposures and options for
remediation. In addition the CEC will provide an opportunity for MEMCARE-SRC researchers to develop novel
solutions that are driven by community concerns surrounding metal exposures on maternal and child health."

The Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) is organized around the principle that the
skills needed for productive careers in environmental science include the ability to think creatively in a cross-
disciplinary context, communicate effectively with a range of audiences, and appreciate the role of
communities and their concerns as both motivators and beneficiaries of environmental research. Our Metals
and Metal Mixtures: Cognitive Aging, Remediation and Exposure Sources (MEMCARE) Superfund Research
Center (SRC) is studying metal mixtures in multiple inter-related contexts: (a) their impact on cognitive aging
(as well as mechanisms of association) in both human and experimental models; (b) identification of critical
exposure windows for later life cognitive decline; (c) characterization of exposure variability; and (d)
development of innovative technologies for exposure remediation. In this context, RETCC will develop
resources to supplement trainee research activities beyond individual projects to promote: 1) cross-disciplinary
experience in environmental science; (2) enhanced development of communication and leadership skills; and
(3) understanding of the wide-ranging impact of Superfund research and the implications of this context on
professional and intellectual development. The key resource developed by the RETCC (in collaboration with
our SRC Research Projects) is a series of cross-disciplinary lab exchanges (externships) and practicums.
Other resources developed by this Core include a new seminar series, workshop, and, in conjunction with the
Community Engagement Core (CEC) and Research Translation Coordinator (RT), community engagement,
and research translation opportunities to complement research activities. CEC and RT activities are designed
to enhance trainee communication skills, not only among scientific peers, but also among constituencies for
which SRC activities resonate—for example, communities impacted by contaminants and government
agencies tasked with contaminant remediation and regulation. In collaboration with the Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC), RETCC will also facilitate opportunities for data science training, including participation
in a course in reproducible science. The Core will facilitate trainee participation in grantee and professional
meetings and associated leadership and professional networking opportunities. Finally, the RETCC will
facilitate trainee access to professional development resources and nominate qualified trainees for NIEHS
SRP-sponsored honors. We anticipate that more than 20 trainees will participate in our SRC (about 2/3 pre-
doctoral and 1/3 postdoctoral), each working on SRC research for 2-4 years. RETCC is a central component of
this SRC, uniting all trainees and their mentors with common goals and shared activities, both inside and
outside of the classroom and laboratory. Every Project will have trainees, and every trainee will interface with
RETCC-sponsored training opportunities multiple times each year. In this context, RETCC will foster
development of scientists with the skills needed to engage in impactful future environmental science research."
10767937,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Early-life exposure to Superfund metal toxicants such as lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and
Manganese (Mn) has been associated with worse cognitive function during aging and is suspected of
contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, the
biological mechanisms underlying the associations remain poorly understood. Mammalian cells, including
neurons and neural stem cells, secrete into the extracellular milieu a variety of tiny membrane-encapsulated
vesicles. These extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain functional signaling molecules that can be taken up by
recipient cells to mediate intercellular communication. One such group of signaling molecules is
microRNAs, which function as master tuners of gene expression by degrading target mRNA and/or
inhibiting translation of the message. Since EVs are encapsulated by a lipid bilayer membrane, molecules
such as microRNAs enclosed in the vesicles are protected from nuclease-mediated degradation and thus
are thus very stable. As a result, EV microRNAs can be easily detected and quantitated in biological fluids
such as plasma/serum and have been used as novel biomarkers for a variety of human diseases. Although
some limited studies have explored the role of EV microRNAs in neural cells, no studies have examined the
role of EV microRNAs on cognitive function in the context of environmental exposures such as metal
toxicants. We hypothesize that metal exposures in early life alter EV microRNAs in the brain and that these
changes in EV microRNAs affect the function of neurons and neural stem cells to accelerate cognitive
aging. We propose three interconnected Specific Aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the
effects of exposures to individual metal exposures (Pb, As, Mn, and Cd) as well as “real-world” metal
mixtures (pre- and post-remediation water samples collected at the San Luis Valley Superfund site) on
developing human fetal brain organoids. Aim 2 will determine the effects of early-life exposure to individual
metals (Pb and As) as well as to the real-world metal mixtures on EV miRs and the cognitive function of
mice later in life. Aim 3 will determine the functional role of selected EV microRNAs in modulating functions
of brain organoids and cognitive function in mice. Our highly multidisciplinary study integrating mouse
models, human epidemiology, and functional cellular studies seeks to establish EV microRNAs not only as
novel biomarkers for metal exposure-related cognitive function, but also as a mechanistic basis for metal-
induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment. This project links with the MEMCARE-SRC by
complementing human studies in Project 1 and seeking to identify biologic mechanisms for health effects of
water contamination at Superfund sites."
10767941,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2016, approximately 15 million people lived within one mile of Superfund sites, including approximately 5% of
all children in the United States (US) under 5 years of age. Lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd) are
among the top ten contaminants on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s 2017 Substances
Priorities List for Superfund sites. These and other metals/metalloids can contaminate surface waters and
groundwater systems, leading to elevated exposures through drinking water. Across the US, tens of millions of
individuals consume drinking water with concentrations of heavy metals in excess of regulatory guidelines.
Exposures to heavy metals have been associated with many negative impacts on public health, including impacts
on neurodevelopment and cognitive aging. However, the contribution of different Superfund sites to this
contamination problem remains poorly characterized on a national scale. This is important because regulations
for drinking water contaminants and risk mitigation actions are often undertaken at the federal level, but most
prior work has focused on site-specific studies. Proximity to Superfund sites may be associated with higher risk
of contamination by heavy metal mixtures in tap water. This relationship is likely more prominent in private wells
than in municipal drinking water supplies, where the finished water quality is influenced by water treatment
technologies. Across different geographic areas, there are considerable differences in municipal water treatment
technology and continuous development of innovative technologies, but little information is available on how this
affects spatial patterns of metal concentrations in tap water. In Aim 1, we will characterize the role of Superfund
sites across the country for heavy metals in private wells by developing novel hybrid mechanistic-empirical
models for heavy metals across the US using a large database of measurements in groundwater from the USGS,
locations of point sources such as Superfund sites, and hydrogeological features/predictors that affect the fate
and transport of trace metals. For Aim 2, we will use new measurements and models to identify the spatial co-
occurrence of different metal mixtures relevant to human exposures from drinking water. This analysis will be
used to identify the composition of metal mixtures for in vitro toxicity tests on brain organoids in Project 2. Aim 3
will leverage >28 million measurements of heavy metals from municipal water supplies to field-evaluate the role
of different treatment technologies. This will provide insights into the effectiveness of treatment technologies and
can help inform Project 4 as well as Superfund site managers responsible for remediation. This project provides
a link between biomedical research in the MEMCARE Center, human exposures, and potential benefits of
remediation technology being developed in Project 4."
10767944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The effective removal of metal contaminants from drinking water at Superfund sites is critical to protect human
health. However, this process is challenged by the presence of naturally co-occurring, otherwise health-benign
ions. Such ions compete for surface adsorption sites in common treatment processes, such as adsorbents,
intended to remove the target metal pollutants. Further, these competitors frequently occur at comparable or
higher concentrations, exhibit analogous chemical structures, and demonstrate similar or superior affinities for
sorption sites. Conventional adsorbent technologies are top-down, wherein surface adsorption sites are created
using or mimicking natural materials. Yet, recent advances in polymer- and nano-science allow for
unprecedented bottom-up capabilities to thermodynamically model, characterize, and controllably synthesize
adsorbents. Here, we will exploit chemical behavioral differences such as polarity, charge distribution, size, and
hydrophobicity between target oxoanion metal pollutants and naturally occurring competing ions to generate
highly selective and tunable polymeric and nano-surfaces. In conjunction with developing oxoanion mass
transport models within treatment processes, these new bottom-up design strategies will be applied to develop
macro-scale sorbents with improved efficiency and effectiveness over current commercial top-down designed
sorbents. We will realize our innovative bottom-up approach by iteratively synthesizing, modeling, and scaling
highly selective sorbents from two platforms offering solutions at multiple scales and under varying drinking water
system conditions (e.g., point-of-use (POU) at individuals household tap vs. point-of-entry (POE) community-
scale applications): 1) utilize biopolymers with various transition metals crosslinkers (TMC) for point of entry
(POE) applications and 2) controlling size, surface area, morphology, and crystallinity of nano-metal oxides
(NMOs) that are integrated into porous electrospun polymer fibers for single-use POU applications. In (1),
resultant crosslinking complexes can exclude competitive ions electrostatically and/or sterically. In (2), the
presence of certain high-energy crystal facets and the coordination of terminal surface groups create surface
chemistry that is favorable toward the sorption of specific target contaminants such that a blend of different
NMOs within a fiber could be used to target specific mixtures of metals. Our preliminary results demonstrate the
potential of both systems to realize selectivity of Superfund-relevant metals that cannot be achieved by current
sorbents. Thus, we propose to revolutionize the approach to removing mixed metal pollutants from Superfund
site drinking water through processes that can simultaneously reduce operational costs, hazardous waste
generation, and drinking water compliance violations while improving the protection of public health."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental conditions are currently classified according to
behavioral criteria. This clinical diagnostic framework does not take into account underlying pathophysiology and
is often insufficient to predict outcomes. The long-term goal is to develop biomarkers that will help cluster
individuals with ASD and related conditions into biologically distinct groups (“biotypes”) and provide the means
to understand the underlying neural mechanisms. Developing biomarkers for use in children is particularly
important so that they can be used from the time symptoms are first recognized. Objective measurement of
sensory processing via electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and scientifically translatable method
to measure function of neural circuits. The proposed project tests the central hypothesis that EEG measures of
sensory processing predict behavioral phenotype (i.e., they are relevant to functional outcome) but also inform
the reclassification of neurodevelopmental conditions by neural circuit pathophysiology to complement
behavioral phenotype. This project uses EEG to measure sensory/neural circuit function in 3-4 year old children
with ASD (n=150), typical development (TD; n=75), and children who do not have ASD but whose caregivers
have concerns about how they process sensory information (Sensory Processing Concerns (SPC) group;
n=150). Aim 1: Determine how circuit-level brain activity, measured in response to sensory stimuli, is altered in
children with ASD vs. SPC vs. TD. Aim 2: Test if sensory EEG endophenotypes predict behavioral phenotype
(e.g., anxiety, attention, irritability, social skills) within and across groups (ASD, TD, SPC). Aim 3: Delineate
neurobiologically-informed subtypes of neural circuit activity in individuals. Rather than relying on behavioral
phenotype as the gold standard, this exploratory aim takes a data-driven approach to cluster individuals in ASD
(and potentially SPC) into biologically distinct subgroups (biotypes) defined by EEG measures of neural circuit
activity to sensory inputs. The proposed project is conceptually innovative because it uses the paradoxical co-
occurrence of sensory hyper- and hypo-reactivity within individuals as the nidus for developing biomarkers that
reflect the granular neurobiological principles underlying sensory processing and ASD. The proposed project is
technically innovative because many of the proposed EEG measures are novel or have never been used to
study ASD. The project is significant because it moves the field from developing biomarkers that reflect
behavioral understanding of ASD towards biomarkers that provide neurobiological understanding of ASD.
Ultimately, this will allow development of diagnostic and stratification biomarkers that guide biologically targeted,
personalized treatments in children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions."

Most newly synthesized proteins destined for the cell surface or secretion must transit through the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) for folding and post-translational processing. Grp94, the ER resident member of the hsp90
family of chaperones, is required for the maturation of various membrane and secreted proteins. Grp94's
control over the fate of these diverse clients makes it an emerging therapeutic target for a number of chronic
diseases including type 2 diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, and sepsis, as well as cancers such as
HER2-positive breast cancer and multiple myeloma. An unanswered question is how Grp94 adapts to different
needs within a dynamic ER folding environment to ensure efficient client capture and folding. Despite being
the most abundant protein in the ER, Grp94 is even further upregulated under conditions of cell stress or
disease. The increased overexpression of Grp94 correlates with its hyperglycosylation, the utilization of the five
minor glycosylation sites that are sparingly occupied in nonstressed cells and tissues. Recent studies have
shown that hyperglycosylation imparts new functions to Grp94 that are essential for the successful response to
stress or maintenance of the pathological state. Our central hypothesis is that differential glycosylation serves
as a tuning mechanism that alters the functional status of Grp94. A systematic analysis of the effects of
glycosylation on Grp94 has been hampered by the difficulty in producing site-specific, homogeneous
glycoproteins that would allow for the clear interpretation of functional and biochemical assays. Here we
propose to study how the activity of Grp94 is regulated by glycosylation and to visualize the capture of a client
protein. We will make use of a novel in-cell expression system developed in our lab that allows us to
selectively control the glycosylation patterns of Grp94 at all available sequons. We will employ these defined
glycosylated species in both in vivo and in vitro Grp94-specific assays that allows for the interrogation of Grp94
activity as a function of attached glycans. Combined with structural and biochemical tools, we expect to
determine how glycosylation regulates the structure and function of Grp94 and how a client protein is captured
by the chaperone."

Neuropathic pain is a major healthcare concern in the US due to its prevalence and high-cost through
healthcare treatment and lost wages. Molecular techniques have been utilized on human dorsal root ganglia
(hDRG) to better understand mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain to lead to the development of novel
therapeutics. This work has demonstrated a sex-specific neuroimmune mechanism in which females show
increased expression of interferon gamma (IFNγ) induced genes. IFNγ is a pro-inflammatory cytokine known
for its anti-viral effects which recently has been shown to produce neuro-inflammation and pain. In animal
models, intrathecal delivery of IFNγ produces paw hypersensitivity, and animals lacking the IFNγ receptor
(IFNGR) fail to produce hyperalgesia following induction of neuropathic pain. Thus, this combined data
suggests a potential female specific role of IFNγ in the hDRG to produce neuropathic pain. Elucidation of IFNγ
mechanisms can lead to the production of sex-specific therapeutics for the treatment of neuropathic pain. I
propose to use hDRG neurons to examine the role of IFNγ in the production of changes consistent with the
development of neuropathic pain. Specific Aim 1 will explore which immune cells present in hDRGs are
capable of producing IFNγ. I will do this through fluorescently activated cell sorting of hDRG neurons of both
sexes to isolate CD4 and CD 8 T cells and monocytes. Then, I will perform RNA sequencing and proteomic
assessments to determine which immune cells possess genes and proteins responsible for IFNγ production
and if any sex differences exist. Then, I will perform a ligand-receptor interactome analysis with the RNA
sequencing and proteomic data sets of each immune cell subtype. This will lead to the generation of testable
hypotheses through which each immune cell can interact with hDRG neurons to lead to the production of
neuropathic pain and if differences exist between the sexes. In Specific Aim 2, I will perform a comprehensive
assessment of the impact of IFNγ signaling on hDRG neurons. In these experiments, I will culture hDRG
neurons of each sex and expose them to IFNγ. First, I will look at the functional impact of IFNγ on hDRG
neurons by using calcium imaging to see if IFNγ can excite and/or sensitize hDRG neurons to later
prostaglandin exposure. Then, I will again expose cultured hDRG neurons to IFNγ and isolate RNA and protein
to perform bulk and single cell RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic assessment. This will give
unprecedented insight into how hDRG neurons respond functionally, transcriptionally, and proteomically to
IFNγ exposure and if any differences exist between the sexes. In sum, this work can lead to the production of
novel, sex-specific therapeutics for the treatment of neuropathic pain. This work will also provide substantial
scientific and bioinformatic training vital to me reaching my long-term career goal of becoming an independent,
translational researcher as a PI at a large academic institution conducting next generation sequencing and
other omic experiments on human tissue."
10779301,"SUMMARY
There is intense interest in gene therapy for the treatment of a wide variety of inherited and acquired
cardiovascular diseases. Yet, progress in this field has been limited because of the low efficiency in transfection
for naked DNA vectors such as plasmids, and the adverse effects associated with more efficient viral vectors. A
promising solution to these problems has been the development of bioengineered adeno-associated virus (AAV)
vectors, which are members of the parvovirus family that are maintained as nuclear episomes. Despite the
success of AAVs in preclinical studies, early clinical trials indicate that the high doses of AAVs required for
therapeutically-sufficient myocyte transduction are associated with dose-related serious and sometimes fatal
immune reactions. This dose-related safety issue could be overcome by increasing the efficiency of
cardiomyocyte-specific AAV transduction. Our laboratories originally pioneered the use of ultrasound (US)
inertial cavitation of cationic microbubble (MB) vectors to augment delivery of plasmid DNA, which is confined
predominately to perivascular cells. More recently, our pilot experiments indicate that MB cavitation with US
within the diagnostic frequency and power range can markedly augment transduction of AAV9, which has
myocyte tropism, and that transduction occurs almost exclusively in cardiomyocytes. Importantly, enhanced
transduction of AAV does not require coupling of the vector to the MB surface. The overall goal of this proposal
is to better understand the mechanisms and ideal conditions for cavitation-facilitated AAV transduction (CFAT)
in preparation for translation into humans. In Aim 1, murine studies will be used to evaluate the dose-related
efficacy, safety, and mechanisms responsible for CFAT using recombinant AAV9 optical reporter systems. In
this Aim, we will also optimize the acoustic condition focusing on key US variables such as acoustic pressure,
pulse duration, and line density. Mechanisms for enhanced transduction with CFAT will be studied with a focus
on cell responses that occur with inertial cavitation of MBs that are likely to increase AAV transport from the
blood pool including glycocalyx modification, caveolin-mediated transcytosis, altered cell junction permeability,
and sialidasae activity. In Aim 2, we will perform proof-of-concept studies demonstrating enhanced therapeutic
effect and safety of CFAT compared to conventional AAV9 therapy in a murine cardiomyopathy model. For these
studies, we will use mice with a known human mutation in the myosin binding protein-C3 gene that produces a
haploinsufficiency model of cardiac hypertrophy and reduced systolic function. As a key translational step, in
Aim 3 we will evaluate efficacy and safety of CFAT in non-human primates using an AAV9 encoding a Na/I
symporter to allow spatial and temporal assessment of transduction efficiency with positron emission tomography
imaging and 18F-tetrafluoroborate. Completion of these Aims will form the basis for testing CFAT in patients with
cardiovascular disease where AAV gene therapy bears great promise, but trials have been delayed based on
concerns regarding therapeutic index."

Increasingly, consumers are vaping cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) or CBD-derived
tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs), such as Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆8-THC) and other THC isomers. Like in
nicotine-containing e-liquids, flavoring chemicals are intentionally added to THC vaping liquids to make them
more appealing for customers. In addition, metals, terpenes, pesticides, and microbial products have also been
identified in commercially available THC vaping liquids. Chemical stability studies indicate that THCs can readily
oxidize. Specifically, CBD and Δ8-THC have been shown to oxidize to their reactive quinone (CBDq and Δ8-
THCq). Contaminant metals, such as Cu and Fe, catalyze the oxidation to Δ8-THCq. Similarly, flavoring
chemicals like furanone compounds, providing a fruity flavor, have been shown to be pro-oxidants. However, the
extent to which vaping liquid constituents, like metals and flavoring chemicals, oxidize THC isomers to reactive
electrophilic quinones or other oxidation products and whether they pose a significant risk for lung health is
completely unknown. Quinones, such as CBDq and Δ8-THCq, are Michael acceptors capable of covalently
modifying biological molecules, especially proteins containing thiol groups. We hypothesize that 1) constituents
like flavoring chemicals and metals, increase vaping-induced oxidation of THC and 2) the resulting quinone
oxidation products cause airway epithelial cell toxicities through protein modification. Aim 1 will identify vaping-
induced oxidation products and determine how vaping liquid constituents (metals, flavoring chemicals) affect the
oxidation of THC isomers. Aim 2 will use our newly developed in vitro Vaping Product Exposure System (VaPES)
to expose differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) to 1) commercial liquids, 2) lab-made liquids
containing specific constituents, or 3) specific oxidation products. Aim 2 will link pro-oxidant constituents with
protein adduction to cellular thiol groups and biological responses. Alkyne-tagged CBD and Δ8-THC analogues
have been prepared for use in “click” cycloaddition to identify protein adduction of inhaled oxidant. In addition to
specific targets, major proteins in the overall “adductome” will be identified, this uncovering novel cellular targets
and biological pathways affected by inhalation of THC oxidation products. Aim 3 will collect nasal mucosal
samples from non-vapers and frequent THC vapers and examined for a) tissue-level gene expression, b)
untargeted metabolomic and proteomic profiles, and c) chemical biomarkers of exposure. Integrate multi-omic
computational data analysis will be applied to uncover dysregulated immune pathways in the nasal mucosa of
THC vapers. Data obtained from this grant will identify constituents of commercial THC vaping products
impacting oxidation, toxicity, and normal functions of the airway mucosa in vitro and in vivo. To better understand
the interaction between vaping-induced oxidation of THC products, signaling cascade initiation, and respiratory
mucosal immune signaling, the translational and integrated multi-omic analysis proposed here, is critical for
advancing the safety of THC vaping products."
10780141,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is a growing contributor to adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, but
treatment with antihypertensives has been controversial due to unclear potential benefits and harms. However,
in 2022, a large randomized controlled trial reported benefits of treating chronic hypertension in pregnancy to
achieve blood pressure targets that are recommended for nonpregnant people (<140/90 mm Hg) without
increasing risk to the fetus. Shortly thereafter, leading obstetrical societies in the U.S. issued recommendations
to align with the trial findings. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to generate knowledge that
improves the quality and equity of clinical care for pregnant and postpartum people with cardiovascular
disorders and ultimately prevent morbidity and mortality. The overall objective is to leverage a nationwide
distributed data network of electronic health records and administrative claims to inform optimal therapy for
chronic hypertension in pregnancy. The central hypothesis is that type of medication, initiation timing, dose,
and adherence affect outcomes of chronic hypertension treatment in pregnancy, which further differs with
concomitant comorbidities. The rationale for this project is that recently revised national recommendations will
likely increase the use of antihypertensive therapy for chronic hypertension in pregnancy, and the findings from
this study will provide critical evidence on optimal therapy. The central hypothesis will be tested through three
specific aims: 1) Compare the overall effectiveness and safety of the most commonly used medications to treat
chronic hypertension in pregnancy; 2) Assess the impact of timing of initiation, dose, and adherence on the
benefits and safety of treating chronic hypertension in pregnancy; and 3) Evaluate the benefits and safety of
treating chronic hypertension in people with concomitant comorbidities, including multifetal gestation, severe
obesity, preexisting diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The proposed project is innovative by
applying a target trial framework and advanced causal inference methods in a distributed data network created
by the candidate. The research project is significant because optimizing treatment of chronic hypertension in
pregnancy has the potential to benefit both the short- and long-term health of many pregnant people and their
infants. This work will also be critically informative for future research led by the candidate on improving the
treatment of preeclampsia, and hypertensive disorders during both the antepartum and postpartum periods.
The proposed research and training will be accomplished with an exceptional mentorship team at Stanford
University. The candidate will build on a strong background in perinatal epidemiology to gain expertise in
perinatal pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and
postpartum. Together, the research and training will advance the candidate’s goal of leading an independent
research program that improves the cardiovascular health of pregnant and postpartum people."

 2 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the second-most common life-shortening inherited disease of Americans, arising from
 3 mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR ion channel. A lifelong disease, CF impacts multiple organ systems
 4 resulting in substantial treatment burden, although most of the morbidity and mortality is associated with
 5 pulmonary disease. Through time, more organ systems become engaged and contribute to health outcomes
 6 for people with CF (PwCF) via comorbidities such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Recently, highly effective
 7 CFTR modulator therapies (HEMTs) have been developed so that now 90% of PwCF have CFTR mutations
 8 for which HEMTs are approved. These drugs will increase longevity even further and this raises the prospect of
 9 increased complications, increased treatment burden, and increased healthcare complexity for PwCF.
10 This increased longevity for PwCF and development of comorbidities as patients age increase the need for
11 longitudinal study of disease progression in this cohort, linking clinical outcomes to studies of patient-derived
12 samples and the patients, themselves, thus requiring new Data Resources to accomplish this goal. Emory
13 University established the CF Biospecimen Repository (CF-BR) in 2010 to enable provision of CF patient-
14 derived samples to basic/translational researchers. The CF-BR provided 3770 CF samples to 39 different
15 research labs since 2015, and now banks >12,000 samples. In 2020, an NIH P30 grant was awarded
16 (P30DK125013) to Emory, Georgia Tech, and Augusta University to form the “Georgia CF Research and
17 Translation Core Center”. One goal under the P30 was to develop the Georgia CF Data Warehouse
18 (GACFDW), a cloud-based high-quality computational infrastructure that would support access to integrated
19 clinical and research data. The GACFDW for the P30 award is built around a longitudinal cohort of 104 PwCF
20 aged 4 to 78 who are studied annually for progression of major non-pulmonary complications of CF.
21 The present proposal seeks to leverage our very successful experience with the CF-BR to expand the
22 GACFDW to include the clinical data on all 900 people with CF followed at Emory and Augusta, plus expand
23 the research data to include the wealth of CF pulmonary investigation conducted by CF scientists at our
24 institutions and elsewhere. Our goal is to develop the GACFDW into a unique resource that will strengthen CF
25 researchers’ ability to integrate multiple research data streams with patient clinical status, providing new
26 opportunities to understand factors contributing to disease progression and response to therapy. To achieve
27 this goal, we propose to: (1) develop and manage the GACFDW; (2) engage more fully and continuously
28 address the needs of the core users of the CF-BR to support data analysis, data sharing, and data
29 preservation; (3) provide training to faculty, staff, and trainees on the effective and ethical use of the GACFDW
30 as a Data Resource; and (4) promote the use of the GACFDW by outside institutions across the nation, and,
31 where relevant, assist in development of similar CF-focused Data Resources at outside institutions."

The genome of the early embryo provides the genetic information of the adult and thereby determines the
health of a person. Surprisingly, though an intact genome is paramount to normal development, the genome of
some mammalian species is highly unstable, including in human. Cleavage-stage embryos acquire high levels
of DNA damage and frequent chromosomal abnormalities that adversely affect developmental potential. We
recently showed that the key reason for these abnormalities are high levels of DNA replication stress during
the first cell cycles. The causes of replication stress are not known, and we are only beginning to understand
the consequences. Therefore, there is a strong rationale to study DNA replication in the mammalian embryo.
A hypothesis central to this proposal is that DNA replication stress is caused by epigenetic remodeling during
the first cell cycles. We furthermore hypothesize that the dynamics of DNA replication, also called DNA
replication timing, predispose specific genomic regions to instability and chromosome breakage. We will test
this hypothesis in three specific Aims. In Aim1, we will identify the causes of DNA replication stress. In Aim2,
we will characterize replication timing during preimplantation development, identify its molecular determinants
in the preimplantation embryo, and correlate these with the sites of chromosome breakage determined in
Aim3. The proposed work is innovative, because it focuses on an essential process - the replication of the DNA
- that has thus far not been examined as a developmentally relevant factor in mammals, and which has not yet
been investigated as a source of genetic change. It is also innovative because of the use of animal model
systems which accurately reproduce the defects seen in human cells.
The contribution is significant, because the proposed studies will lead to an understanding of the causes,
mechanisms, and consequences of genome instability in the first few cell divisions of mammalian
development. The work proposed will help understand the source of both normal as well as disease-causing
genetic variation in the genome."
10918223,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Vaccination is perhaps the greatest public health achievement of our time. With an explosion of antibiotic
resistance, developing new vaccines against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens is more
important than ever. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is an important opportunistic human pathogen that
causes severe infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), burns, severe wounds, pneumonia, as well as
critically ill patients who require intubation or catheterization. Clearing Pa has become problematic as it has
become increasingly antibiotic resistant. This is exacerbated by the fact that the biggest risk factor for negative
outcomes associated with MDR Pa is advanced age. After the age of 60, there is a significant increase in
morbidity and mortality resulting from MDR Pa. While there are Pa vaccines in development, none are
licensed. The goal of the R21 is to define a stable nanoparticle (NP) suspension for our prophylactic
Pa vaccine that prevents Pa, regardless of strain, prior to establishment of a biofilm.
 Like many Gram-negative pathogens, Pa strains of the PAO1/PA14-clades possess a type III secretion
system (T3SS) that allows avoidance of host innate immunity and is required for initiating infection.
Structurally resembling a molecular syringe with an external needle, the T3SS apparatus (T3SA) provides an
energized conduit from the bacterium into the host cell for transporting the effector proteins that mediate key
aspects of infection. A needle tip protein and the first of two translocator proteins localize to the distal end of
the T3SA needle to mediate host cell contact. In Pa these proteins are PcrV and PopB, respectively, and they
are required for pathogenesis. They are also highly conserved (95-98%) among all P. aeruginosa strains that
possess a T3SS. We have fused PcrV and PopB to give PaF. To promote simultaneous uptake of antigen
and adjuvant by antigen presenting cells, we genetically fused LTA1, the active moiety of dmLT, to the N-
terminus of PaF (L-PaF). L-PaF reduces mouse and rat lung Pa burden significantly when challenged with a
PAO1/PA14 clade Pa. Recently, Pa outliers of the PAO7 clade have been identified that are devoid of the
T3SS and instead use exolysin A (ExlA) to disrupt host cell membranes. We have added ExlA to our L-PaF
formulation and, when delivered intranasally, have demonstrated protection against PAO1/14 and PAO7
clades in mice. Sera from these mice exhibit significant opsonophagocytic killing (OPK). Additionally, elevated
levels of IL-17 were secreted from lung cells of L-PaF-vaccinated mice. Both IL-17 and OPK are deemed
important in clearing Pa infections.
 In this R21, we will assess the protective immune response of a stable particulate ExlA/L-PaF NP
suspension. We will complete this project in two aims: 1) We will generate nanoparticle formulations for the
ExlA/L-PaF antigens and assess their stability. 2) We will then determine the immune response(s) elicited by
the ExlA/L-PaF nanoparticle formulation(s) and determine their ability to clear Pa from the lungs."

 Identification of small molecule protein targets that modulate T cell activity continues to be a therapeutic
goal when treating patients with cancer, autoimmune diseases, and allogeneic organ rejection. To that end,
our laboratory has determined that the druggable kinase DNA dependent-protein kinase catalytic subunit
(DNA-PKcs) is required for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function. We observe robust DNA-PKcs activation following
T cell stimulation, and once activated, DNA-PKcs is necessary to initiate several key immunogenic transcriptional
programs including those driven by the transcription factors NFAT, NF𝜅B, and EGR1. Importantly, both chemical
and genetic inhibition of DNA-PKcs significantly disrupts T cell activation, metabolism, cytokine production and
the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill target cells. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which DNA-
PKcs regulates T cell activity, we performed a phospho-proteomic screen of T cells treated with a small molecule
DNA-PKcs inhibitor. Data from this screen and our follow-up studies confirm the TCR signaling protein Linker for
Activation of T cells (LAT) as a significant phosphorylation target of DNA-PKcs. In this proposal, we will utilize
novel inducible transgenic mouse models designed to “knockout” DNA-PKcs expression specifically in mature
CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes to evaluate the relevance of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation of LAT to T cell function
and its impact on T cell response to antigen stimulation. In Aim 1, we will characterize the interaction between
LAT and DNA-PKcs through in vitro studies using DNA-PKcs-deficient CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and CRISPR-
generated LAT phosphomutants. Aim 2 will focus on determining how loss of DNA-PKcs either before or after
T cell activation impacts CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response to antigen in vivo using the OVA-specific TCR transgenic
OTII and OTI mouse models. Completion of these aims will provide new insights into a completely
uncharacterized signaling mechanism that significantly impacts CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity with
considerable implications for novel therapy approaches."

Spine diseases, including intervertebral disc degeneration, facet joint syndrome, and scoliosis, are common
diseases. Both intervertebral disc degeneration and facet joint syndrome, as well as scoliosis, are frequently
associated with/or may lead to chronic low back pain, which is very common, causing more global disability than
any other condition. The broad, long-term goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of
both the specification of the cell identity and the regulatory network that regulates the formation and patterning
of the intervertebral disc, which plays a pivotal role in spinal function and is subject to developmental disease,
degenerative disease, and injury. However, like articular cartilage after damage, intervertebral disc cells do not
repair/regenerate well. Thus, it’s critical to identify both the transcription factors and/or the signaling molecules
that determine different cell types (including stem/progenitors) in the intervertebral disc to develop different
strategies to treat spine disease. My recent findings have indicated that the transcription factor Creb5 is
specifically expressed in intervertebral mesenchymal cells before IVD formation; is subsequently expressed in
all the cells in the annulus fibrosus, including both the inner annulus fibrosus (IAF) and the outer annulus
fibrosus (OAF) after IVD formation; and is also expressed in facet joints. Most significantly, I have found that
the morphology of the annulus fibrosus cells is significantly altered in mice engineered to lack Creb5 function;
and that expression of both Prg4/lubricin and the WNT antagonist Wif1 (Wnt inhibitor factor 1) are dramatically
decreased in the intervertebral discs of these mice. Thus, my findings indicate that Creb5 is necessary to maintain
the proper morphology of the intervertebral disc, and is critical to drive expression of both Prg4/lubricin and
Wif1 in the intervertebral disc. Consistent with the importance of Creb5 in the IVD, a genome-wide association
study identified Creb5 as a susceptibility locus for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in Japan. A more recent
genome-wide association study identified Creb5 as a susceptibility locus associated with surgery for degenerative
rotator cuff disease, which is most often caused by progressive wear and tear of another fibrous connective tissue
(tendon). As Creb5 is specifically expressed in the intervertebral mesenchymal (IM) that gives rise to the
intervertebral disc, in facet joints, and in all the cells of annulus fibrosus, I hypothesize that Creb5 plays a critical
role in the spine and propose to further investigate the role of Creb5 in spine development. This project will
determine the expression pattern of Creb5 during spine development stage and adult stage; will delineate the
fate of Creb5-expressing cells during spine development; and test whether Creb5HA-CreERt2 mice can be an adult
stage genetic tool with temporal control to target all mature annulus fibrosus cells. This project will also identify
both Creb5 regulated genes and chromatin regulatory elements that bind Creb5 in the intervertebral disc."
10931442,"The purpose of this application is to perform the necessary clinical studies to seek regulatory approval for an
artificial intelligence (AI) software as medical device (SaMD) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) diagnosis.
ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide, with approximately 50,000 babies going blind
annually, most of which is preventable with accurate and timely diagnosis. The i-ROP DL algorithm was
developed by the i-ROP research consortium and has been shown to provide expert-level diagnosis of plus
disease, a component of severe ROP, based on images from the Retcam (Natus, Middleton, WI) digital fundus
camera. The output is a vascular severity score (VSS) that corresponds to spectrum of plus disease, as defined
by the International Classification of ROP, and has been endorsed by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as
an appropriate output for an ROP SaMD. If incorporated into a clinical workflow, this technology could provide
automated, immediate, expert-level diagnosis of ROP to the bedside, solving one of the key gaps in care that
results in preventable blindness worldwide. The first aim of this project is to update and retrain the i-ROP DL
algorithm to improve speed and repeatability for clinical use, finalize the image quality and pre-processing
pipeline, and integrate it into the iTeleGEN data management system, an ROP telemedicine software platform.
The second aim is to perform the necessary clinical studies for the two proposed indications for use (IFU): The
first IFU will be as an assistive diagnostic study to improve the clinical diagnosis of plus disease with regulatory
approval based on a multi-reader multi-case study with a primary outcome of improved diagnosis of plus disease,
based on a five expert reference standard diagnosis, with the use of the VSS. The second IFU will be for
autonomous ROP screening for more than mild ROP (MTMROP, defined as type 2 or worse according to the
Early Treatment for ROP study definition). The pivotal study will have a primary outcome of 85% sensitivity and
85% specificity for the diagnosis of MTMROP, with a secondary outcome of greater than 95% sensitivity for
detection of treatment-requiring ROP. The third aim of the proposal is to validate the i-ROP DL algorithm on a
digital fundus camera made by Forus Health (Bengaluru, India), a digital eye care company, with ROP camera
distribution in more than 20 countries. If successful, then once FDA approval is obtained on the Retcam it may
be extended through a 510K process to a camera that is more affordable than the Retcam and widely available
in low- and middle-income countries. This work will be done by Siloam Vision, a company started by two of the
inventors of the i-ROP DL algorithm, in conjunction with Oregon Health & Science University. At the end of the
study period, the goal will be to have the necessary data to support FDA approval of the i-ROP DL algorithm for
two IFUs on two digital fundus cameras and being one step closer to bringing this technology to the bedside to
reduce the number of babies going blind from ROP worldwide."
10758292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
What is the role of adenosine as a rapid modulator of neurotransmission and how can we harness its power for
potential therapeutic use? To answer questions such as these, we need analytical tools that can measure
multiple neurochemicals simultaneously with high temporal and spatial resolution. Our lab pioneered fast-scan
cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) for adenosine, and discovered spontaneous, transient adenosine signaling that lasts
only a few seconds. However, the range and effects of rapid adenosine neuromodulation are not well understood.
Genetically-encoded sensors have recently been developed for neurotransmitter and calcium detection that offer
high sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution. While they can monitor a wide variety of neurochemicals, and
not just electroactive molecules, there are still limited colors to detect different analytes. FSCV combined with
genetically-encoded sensors would be advantageous to detect the neuromodulator adenosine and measure its
downstream effects on dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission, as well as neuronal activity. The long-term
goal of my lab is to develop new tools for monitoring real-time neuromodulation in the brain. The goal of this
project is to develop multiplexed tools to understand neurochemical interactions and apply these tools to
understand adenosine modulation of glutamate, dopamine, and calcium. The central hypothesis is that rapid
adenosine release provides transient, but spatially localized, modulation of neurotransmitters in the brain. In the
first Aim, we will develop multichannel FSCV, with an array of four electrodes, to determine how far adenosine
diffuses in brain slices and the range of its neuromodulatory effects on dopamine release. In the second Aim,
we will combine FSCV with genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors to probe the spatial and temporal profile of
adenosine (measured with FSCV) modulation of dopamine (measured with GRABDA) or glutamate (measured
with iGluSnFR). In the third Aim, we will combine multichannel FSCV and in vivo fiber photometry measurements
of genetically-encoded sensors. We will demonstrate in vivo detection of adenosine, dopamine, and calcium
changes to probe adenosine neuromodulation of neurotransmission and neuronal activity simultaneously. This
research is significant because it develops tools that are broadly applicable for multiplexing neurotransmitter
and neuromodulator measurements, harnessing the combined strengths of FSCV and genetically-encoded
sensors. It is also significant because multiplexed tools will provide an unprecedented picture of the temporal
and spatial dynamics of adenosine neuromodulation. The biological impact is understanding the rapid and local
nature of adenosine neuromodulation, which is important for designing adenosine-based therapeutics for
diseases such as Parkinson’s, ischemia, or traumatic brain injury where adenosine could be neuroprotective.
The multiplexed tools could be applied to monitoring many other neurochemical interactions, in brain slices or in
vivo, and will advance the field of neurochemical monitoring beyond one neurochemical at a time sensing."
10763381,"Homologous recombination plays a critical role in reductional segregation of chromosomes in
meiosis. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed induction of DNA double strand
breaks (DSBs) and involves a mechanism related to recombinational repair of DSBs in mitotic
cells. Meiotic recombination is subject to unique regulatory processes that promote
recombination between homologous chromatids rather than sister chromatids and also regulate
the frequency of crossover type recombination events to ensure all homologous chromosome
pairs engage in at least one such event. The central step of recombination is homologous
strand invasion and exchange. Budding yeast and many other organisms including humans
have a specialized meiotic recombinase, Dmc1, that catalyzes the central step of meiotic
recombination which involves DNA sequence homology searching that culminates in DNA
strand exchange to form regions of hybrid DNA that connect recombining partners. A different
strand exchange protein, Rad51, catalyzes the central step of mitotic recombination. Dmc1 has
a unique set of meiosis-specific accessory proteins, but is also regulated by mitotic
recombination proteins, including the mitotic recombinase Rad51. Rad51 is converted from an
enzyme in mitosis into to a Dmc1 accessory protein during meiosis. Our group studies the
molecular mechanism through which Dmc1 promotes meiotic recombination. We seek to
understand how Dmc1’s activity is regulated by each of its accessory proteins. This goal is
achieved by combining a wide range of advanced experimental approaches. Of particular
importance is our group’s unique effort to biochemically reconstitute the recombination process
using purified components. To complement our biochemical studies, we were first to develop
the tools and methods required to study the architecture and dynamics of meiotic
recombinosomes using super-resolution light microscopy. Our group also employs molecular
genetic techniques that allow detection of broken and branched DNA recombination
intermediates, as well as the protein-protein interactions that occur during the recombination
process. We seek to combine these approaches to uncover important mechanistic features of
the recombination process including the regulatory mechanisms that control it."

Hearing loss has a profound impact on individuals, causing communication problems, social isolation, and cognitive
decline. Microvascular pathology is a significant factor seen in many types of hearing loss, including sound-induced
hearing loss, age-related hearing loss, genetic hearing loss, and autoimmune inner ear disease. Normal capillary
blood flow is highly controlled by pericytes. The pericytes, specialized mural cells surrounding small blood vessels
adjacent to endothelial cells, are vital for normal vascular function. Pericyte pathology, such as pericyte loss or
degeneration, is a significant factor in degenerative neural diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and brain
dementia. The cochlear microvasculature contains an abundant population of pericytes. However, the role of
pericytes in the cochlea, in general, is understudied. In particular, their roles in vascular and hearing function is
largely unknown. Using a combination of well-established and cutting-edge techniques, and building on preliminary
data produced under R21 support, the proposed five-year research program continues the investigation of
mechanisms outlined in our current R21 grant to further explore the role of PCs, PC-related vascular pathology,
and angiogenesis in cochlear health. Success in this project will open new clinical options for treatment of aging-,
noise exposure-, and genetic vascular deficiency-related deafness in which PCs are compromised."

and advancement of Scholars to address the growing gap between research and the translation into clinical
practice. Our Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Partner Network of 11 institutions brings
existing training infrastructure and ongoing partnerships. Integrating diverse and complementary approaches
within our clinical translational science (CTS) teams will accelerate scientific innovations and promote
enhanced prevention, treatment, wellness, and health equity for the individual, the community, and ultimately
the population in our region, which is disproportionately burdened by chronic disease and poor health
outcomes with social inequity being at the root cause We aim to create a career development program that
instills Scholars with mastery of translational research (TR) core competencies through a curriculum that will
nurture “translational thinking” and working with those outside their discipline. To be successful translational
researchers, Scholars will acquire knowledge of translational science (TS). Over the grant period, we will
provide career development for 24 Scholars who will be supported by a collaborative research base (136
mentors) with more than $277 million in extramural funding. Our overall goal for this career development
program is to facilitate new, and expand existing, innovative early career training opportunities across
the translational spectrum in areas such as drug discovery, integrative “omics”, clinical informatics,
community engagement, and dissemination and implementation science with the goal of addressing
disease and health disparities that disproportionately impact residents of the Deep South. We will
mentor early career investigators and facilitate their growth into academic leaders within our Partner
Network and nationally. Our specific aims are to: 1) Identify, recruit, and matriculate a cohort of Scholars
across the CCTS Network diverse by race, ethnicity, gender, scientific discipline and institution.; 2) Provide an
intensive multidisciplinary, continually updated curriculum and collaborative, experiential TS training program
with emphasis on diseases and health disparities prevalent in the US Deep South; 3) Enhance the
individualized career development of translational scientists representing a broad range of clinical and
methodological disciplines through individual-, peer-, and team-based mentoring approaches, with a focus on
future grant development and submission support to assist in successful career transition; 4) Advance
mentoring, foster “team science,” and continue the expansion of cross-institutional training experiences for K12
Scholars and other early career investigators. The Deep South Translational Research K12 will provide
new and expand existing infrastructure across our Partner Network to recruit and train individuals with
significant potential to be highly successful translational scientists and to mentor them toward
becoming leaders nationally with the ultimate goal to improve health outcomes in the Deep South."
10765610,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that affects 26 million Americans and results in
approximately 3600 deaths per year in the US alone (1a). Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and both Th2
predominant and Th17 predominant forms have been described with different etiologies. While Th2 cytokines
are more common in patients with allergic asthma, there is variability among these patients in regards to the
types of Th2 cytokines found, severity of disease, and response to currently available therapies. IL-9 producing
Th9 cells are a new cytokine producing T cell that are often found in patients with allergic asthma and correlate
with disease severity. However, the mechanisms that regulate Th9 differentiation and function remain largly
unknown. We have identified a novel inhibitory pathway that limits the differentiation and pathogenicity of both
Th2 and Th9 cells and protects against airway remodeling in mice. This pathway is controlled by the E3 ubiquitin
ligase Cul5. Supporting this, we recently generated mice in which Cul5 was deleted only in T cells, and
determined that Cul5 limits airway remodeling after asthma induction. Specifically, we found that Cul5fl/flCD4-Cre
mice showed increased lung inflammation, eosinophilia, goblet cell hyperplasia and fibrosis following house dust
mite exposure. T cells from Cul5fl/flCD4-Cre mice were much more likely to Th2 and Th9 cells. Using a screen to
reveal Cul5 binding partners, we identified three substrate receptors that cooperate with Cul5 in T cells. Based
on these preliminary data we hypothesize that Cul5 associates with one or more of these substrate
receptors to ubiquitylate substrates and thus limits the differentiation of Th2 and Th9 cells and prevents
asthma. Based on our preliminary data, our long term goal is to develop novel therapeutic strategies that activate
the Cul5 pathway to turn Th2 and Th9 cells off in patients with asthma. However, to do this effectively we must
first determine 1) how Cul5 regulates T cell biology, 2) determine how interacting partners aid Cul5 function, and
3) delineate how, on a mechanistic level, Cul5 complexes limit T cell differentiation and pathogenicity (i.e identify
substrates). In this proposal we will determine key aspects of how Cul5 restricts T cell differentiation and function,
thus revealing the signaling pathways that allow Th9 cells to develop and drive asthma. Additionally, we will
identify regulatory mechanisms that promote the activation and function of Cul5. This information will provide
crucial information needed as we begin to develop therapies to target Cul5 to reduce the differentiation of Th2

The goal of project is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in INF2 cause focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in humans. More than 45 different FSGS-associated mutations have
been identified. A subset of people with FSGS-causing INF2 mutations also exhibit Charcot Marie Tooth
disease. INF2 is unique for a formin family member in that it accelerates both actin polymerization and
depolymerization. Formins can autoinhibit their own activity by an intramolecular interaction between two
domains, the N-terminal DID (diaphanous inhibitory domain) and the C-terminal DAD (diaphanous
autoregulatory domain). INF2 has two major splice variants, one of which is associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum, INF2-CAAX, and a second isoform, INF2-nonCAAX, that helps maintain Golgi integrity. INF2-CAAX
is the major podocyte isoform.
During the last period of this grant, we made significant progress in our understanding of both INF2 biology and
how INF2 function is altered by mutations. We now understand the role INF2 plays in organelle function, and
have a clearer understand of its role in regulating mitochondrial fission. We have identified a major mechanism
of inhibition of INF2 activity, an interaction with an endogenous protein complex (cyclase-associated protein
bound to actin that is post-translationally acetylated). We have also found that the INF2 protein undergoes
cleavage at a site between the N-terminal DID region and the C-terminus, containing the FH2 and DAD
regions, which may be important in regulating INF2 function and perhaps disinhibiting the functions of both
regions of the protein. We have found that INF2 undergoes a cleavage event that may be important in
regulating INF2 function The fact that in contrast to essentially all other actin regulatory proteins, INF2-DID
mutations are a relatively common form of inherited FSGS, suggests that INF2-DID possesses unique and
non-redundant functions in the podocyte. Our long-term goal is to understand these functions and, ultimately,
exploit them for therapeutic benefit.
We have four major goals: (1) Define the specific biochemical effects of FSGS-causing mutants. We will test
the effects of multiple FSGS mutants on the interaction of INF2 with the endogenous inhibitory complex and
examine INF2 mutant interactions with its binding partners; (2) Define INF2 function and mutation-mediated
dysfunction in cells. This includes examination of how INF2 mutations alter its regulation of mitochondrial
function; (3) Define the function of INF2 cleavage; (4) Use genetically engineered mice to better understand
INF2 function and mutation mediated dysfunction in vivo."

for his continued mentoring of MD and MD/PhD fellows and junior faculty and for expansion of his patient-
oriented research program. A focus of the Hauser Lab is to identify biomarkers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
that define particularly aggressive strains. Past work has successfully identified several genes that are
associated with more severe infections in mouse models. The goal of the proposed research is to expand
these studies into populations of human patients. In the first project, the focus will be on acute respiratory
infections. P. aeruginosa genes associated with strains that cause especially severe ventilator-associated
pneumonia in intensive care unit patients will be identified. To begin to parse genes into functional categories,
those genes that allow P. aeruginosa to resist killing by neutrophils will also be identified. In the second project,
the focus will be on chronic respiratory infections. A systems biology approach will be used to identify P.
aeruginosa strains capable of persisting in the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis. A mouse model of
chronic airway infection will then be used to determine whether aspects of these strains play a causal role in
persistence. These projects combine powerful genomic, genetic, and microbiological techniques with human
specimens and corresponding clinical data to yield cutting-edge patient-oriented research. They are thus ideal
training vehicles for junior clinician investigators and have the potential to lead to improvements in patient care.
Mentees will participate in a rigorous and broad mentoring program that utilizes the many resources available
at Northwestern University to maximize their development into independent patient-oriented researchers. In
summary, this K24 award will provide salary support and research funds to allow Dr. Hauser to spend a
substantial portion of his effort mentoring clinical fellows and junior faculty in patient-oriented research and to
expand his patient-oriented research program."
10765684,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 35 million people worldwide. However, there is no effective treatments
to slow or halt the underlying neurodegeneration of AD. Strikingly, women are affected by AD about twice as
much as men. Why women are disproportionately affected by AD is not well understood.
 Here, we hypothesize that there is an interaction between biological sex and brain gene expression that
predisposes women to have a higher risk for AD. This hypothesis builds on our work investigating the genetic
control of gene expression in the human brain. In those studies, we have identified genetic sites that are
associated with variation in gene expression at the transcript and protein level in the human brain. Identifying
genetic sites associated with natural variation in brain gene expression are incredibly useful to resolve genetic
signals identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) to specific causal transcripts and proteins. We
have successfully used brain gene transcript and protein expression results with GWAS results to identify
novel proteins for AD (Wingo et al, Nat Genet, 2021) and depression (Wingo et al, Nat Neurosci, 2021). These
analyses implicate the causes of inherited genetic risk, which are presumably among the most important early
contributors to disease, which make them highly relevant to resolving sex-specific disease risk.
 To test our hypothesis, we will first perform a sex-specific brain expression analysis for transcripts and
proteins (Aim 1). To do this, we will leverage existing brain transcripts and protein expression data generated
by national resources, and we propose a novel approach to cost-effectively increase the depth of proteomes to
improve power. We expect to generate sex-specific quantitative trait loci (QTL) for brain transcripts (N=1655,
61% women) and proteins (N=1584, 66% women), and each gene will then be tested for evidence of
interaction with sex. These results are likely to be of general interest to the neuroscience and genetics
communities, and the data and results will be made widely available to the science community. In Aim 2, we
will perform a sex-specific GWAS of AD, and we will identify genetic variants that interact with sex. To do this,
we will perform sex-stratified GWAS using 1) case-control status for AD in participants from US studies
(N=27,580), 2) AD-proxy case-control in participants from the UK Biobank (N=431,000), and iii) a meta-
analysis of 1 and 2. In Aim 3, we will identify brain transcripts and proteins contributing to AD pathogenesis that
are specific to men or women, respectively. To do this, we will integrate the sex-specific brain QTLs with the
sex-specific GWAS results to resolve GWAS signals to proteins for women and men, separately. For AD
genetic signals with evidence for sex interaction, we will test whether sex-specific gene expression accounts
for the differences in AD risk between the sexes using causal inference approaches (e.g., Mendelian
randomization). Findings from this project are highly likely to provide novel mechanistic insights into sex
differences in AD and promising new targets for further sex-specific mechanistic and therapeutic studies of AD."
10764472,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Knowledge of how three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is linked to gene expression and chromatin
state is paramount to understanding human health and disease. The cohesin complex is a major regulator of
genome organization that dynamically extrudes DNA loops to bring together enhancers, promoters, and
insulators. While the insulator protein CTCF is known to capture and stabilize an extruding cohesin complex, it
is not clear how cohesin is stabilized at enhancers and promoters that lack CTCF. Furthermore, the causal role
of cohesin-mediated loops in regulating gene expression is not understood. We recently discovered that
cohesin variant complexes, composed of either STAG1 or STAG2 subunits and either PDS5A or PDS5B
subunits, colocalize across the genome, yet have surprisingly distinct effects on gene expression. In this
proposed study, we will answer the next set of questions about cohesin biology. We hypothesize that cohesin
complexes at specific genomic sites have distinct biochemical properties and binding partners that mediate
effects on transcription and chromatin state defined by histone modifications. To test these hypotheses, we are
using an integrative approach that combines genetic, biochemical, genomic, and proteomic assays in
embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells following genome editing, protein depletion, acute degradation, or
inhibition with small molecules. These studies will 1) identify novel cohesin-interacting proteins using proteomic
approaches, 2) investigate the properties of cohesin complexes at different genomic sites and with different
binding partners, and 3) elucidate the role of cohesin-mediated DNA loops in regulation of transcription and
chromatin state at genomic sites lacking CTCF. The proposed multi-disciplinary approach leverages our
extensive experience in functional genomics and expands on our recent findings that demonstrated roles for
cohesin subunits and cohesin regulators in DNA loop formation and transcription. This will contribute to our
long-term goal of applying cutting-edge technologies to uncover the molecular mechanisms that define how 3D
genome organization influences chromatin state and transcriptional control to govern cell identity. Completion
of this project will fill critical gaps in knowledge about gene regulation that inform our understanding of human
developmental disorders and cancers linked to epigenetic defects."
10764474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein structure and dynamics are key parameters for determining the function of proteins as enzymes, binding
partners, and key players in cellular signaling pathways and responses including protein quality control and
antibiotic resistance. Binding events, catalysis, and posttranslational modifications can each effect changes in
structure and dynamics to yield positive or negative regulation of protein activity and downstream function in
relevant cellular pathways. Cellular protein quality control systems enable the robust response to protein
misfolding that is essential for normal cellular function. Numerous pathologies including neurodegenerative
disorders, ataxias, and cancers can result from defects in the protein quality control system formed by the
interaction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp70 Interacting Protein) and the ATP-dependent
chaperone Hsp70 (70 kilodalton heat shock protein). Despite the importance of the CHIP/Hsp70 protein quality
control complex, the dynamics and structures that enable the triage mechanism used by the CHIP/Hsp70
complex to target misfolded proteins for either Hsp70-mediated refolding or ubiquitin proteasome-mediated
degradation are unknown. Antibiotic resistance mediated by beta-lactamases enables bacteria to evade
treatment. While it is clear that dynamic changes occur within the structure of beta-lactamases, the detailed
molecular mechanism for how these dynamics dictate the activity of the beta-lactamase toward front-line
antibiotics is not well understood. How to exploit these dynamics to enable selective and potent inhibition is also
not understood. Across this diverse set of proteins, biological posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and
synthetic PTMs provide opportunities to further modulate activity. Within the protein quality control pathway,
biological PTMs are most commonly observed through phosphorylation and methylation. A greater
understanding of how PTMs alter structure and dynamics of CHIP and Hsp70 are greatly needed, particularly
given the critical role of dynamics in enabling CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Hsp70-bound clients. Synthetic
PTMs for beta-lactamases are most commonly encountered for drugs that covalently modify the protein and
fundamental knowledge of how these modifications alter the dynamics of the beta-lactamase is not available.
Across the protein quality control and antibiotic resistance projects, the rational design of potent and specific
drugs requires a greater understanding of the structures and dynamics that regulate each process and pathway.
Existing gaps in our knowledge of the extent and role of dynamics prevent each field from utilizing rational design
to produce new therapeutics."
10764475,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cell motility is one of the oldest problems in cell biology as the movement of cells was one of the first things
noted when the microscope was developed in the 17th century. The last sixty years of work revealed that the
molecular underpinnings of motility involve the active control of the cytoskeleton. However, many questions
remain unanswered. While we have identified many of the components of the cytoskeleton and know a great
deal about their biochemical and structural characteristics, we lack a systematic understanding of how the parts
interact to produce coordinated cytoskeletal function such as during cell migration. Perhaps the most important
problem in cell motility is understanding how cells perceive various cues in their environment and convert this
information into a directed migration response. A deeper understanding of these two inter-related problems will
inform higher order biological processes such as embryogenesis, immune response, and wound healing, as well
as diseases states such as metastatic cancer. This proposal seeks to extend our work in this area with the
renewal of our R35/MIRA grant, R35 GM130312. Using a conditional knockout mouse model where the gene
encoding the critical Arpc2 (p34) subunit of Arp2/3 can be deleted on command, we have been dissecting the
systematic relationship between Arp2/3-branched actin and non-branched actin in several cellular processes.
Our published and preliminary data indicate that the migration substrate has a profound influence on the
architecture of branched actin at the leading edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, unpublished proteomic data
demonstrate that a tyrosine kinase pathway controlling clathrin-mediated endocytosis is mis-regulated in the
absence of Arp2/3. Building on these observations, we propose to study the role of integrin-based cell adhesion
on Arp2/3-branched actin regulation and the regulatory network that controls the balance between clathrin pits
and flat clathrin lattices. On the question of directed migration, we propose to build on our recently published
durotaxis assay to understand the relationship between cell-generated traction force, cell shape and directed
whole cell movement. Finally, we propose to use our expertise in cellular optogenetics to develop an optotaxis
assay to direct the migration of cell with gradients of light and test the role of polarized signaling pathways in
controlling actin architecture, cell shape and directed migration."
10764617,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Copper is an essential micronutrient required for the growth and development of aerobic organisms. Copper
serves as a catalytic cofactor for many enzymes involved in various cellular pathways, the most important of
which is cytochrome c oxidase required for mitochondrial energy generation. Not surprisingly, mutations that
cause systemic or subcellular copper deficiency give rise to various fatal infantile disorders, including Menkes
disease and a subset of mitochondrial disorders. Despite decades of work, there are currently no approved
treatments for these lethal disorders, which in large part reflects a limited understanding of the mechanisms by
which copper is trafficked to mitochondria and the role it plays in mitochondrial metabolism. Filling this knowledge
gap will require a multidisciplinary approach that leverages the strengths of different model organisms to
understand the mechanisms by which copper is transported, stored, and distributed within cells. Over the last
decade, we have taken a multidisciplinary approach to discover new players in copper transport and delivery to
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. Through these efforts, we have identified a promising copper-transporting
drug, elesclomol, that circumvents disease-causing mutations in the mitochondrial copper acquisition by
promoting copper delivery to cytochrome c oxidase and restoring aerobic respiration. Building on this success,
we will now focus on identifying critical regulators of mitochondrial copper by leveraging our copper-deficient
yeast, zebrafish, and mouse models to decipher the fundamental roles of copper in mitochondrial metabolism.
The overarching goals of our research program are to 1) determine the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial
copper acquisition and delivery to cytochrome c oxidase; 2) identify novel roles of copper within the mitochondrial
matrix; and 3) develop small molecule adjuvants to enhance the efficacy and safety of elesclomol. To achieve
these goals, we will employ genomic, proteomic, and small molecule screens in copper-deficient yeast models
to identify endogenous copper-transporting molecules, new copper-dependent mitochondrial metabolic
pathways, and small molecules that improve the therapeutic properties of elesclomol. We will translate these
discoveries to mammalian model systems to significantly advance our understanding of mitochondrial copper
biology."
10765321,"Summary
 DNA replication stress is a major source for genome instability associated with numerous diseases,
including cancer. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of replication stress and, conversely, how
accurate, complete, and rapid chromosomal DNA replication is achieved during normal cell proliferation, is
crucial for understanding the mechanisms that maintain or threaten genome stability during normal
development and disease, respectively. Here we propose experiments that will illuminate both the intrinsic
mechanism of the eukaryotic DNA replication machinery and its response to diverse replication stress
conditions. Previously, we have generated a fully reconstituted origin-dependent DNA replication system
based on purified budding yeast proteins. More recently, we have begun to reconstitute replisomes with
purified human proteins. These systems form the central platform for research in our lab.
 The normal and uninterrupted progression of replication forks is frequently challenged by physical
obstacles on the parental DNA. These include non-B-form DNA secondary structures and tightly bound non-
histone protein-DNA complexes. While non-B-form DNA secondary structures induce fork stalling in a
stochastic and unscheduled manner, the programmed stalling of the replisome at tightly bound protein-DNA
complexes can serve important biological functions. How individual physical obstacles on chromosomal DNA
induce fork stalling, are overcome by fork restoration mechanisms, or elicit distinct biological outcomes is
incompletely understood. To illuminate fork stalling mechanisms, we will investigate the molecular
mechanisms by which such physical obstacles impede the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, CMG (Cdc45-
MCM-GINS). Specifically, we will determine the mechanisms by which G-quadruplexes (G4s) impede CMG
progression on the leading strand and the mechanisms by which replication forks stalled at G4s may be
restored by accessory DNA helicases and fork remodelers. As an example for programmed fork stalling at
protein-DNA complexes, we will investigate the mechanism of unidirectional fork stalling at the replication fork
barrier (RFB) derived from both yeast and human rDNA repeats and examine the mechanism of replication
termination upon fork convergence at these sites. Stalled replication forks are both inducers and targets of
the replication checkpoint, which is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity by stabilizing stalled
forks and coordinating fork restoration with cell cycle progression. Continuing our previous work, which has
led to the identification of yeast replisomes as direct targets for the checkpoint effector kinase, Rad53, we will
determine the mechanism(s) by which the checkpoint controls fork progression."
10765326,"Streamlining PPI Inhibitor Discovery via Chemically Enhanced Phage Display
Project Summary
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly recognized as rewarding targets against which powerful
therapeutic drugs can be devised. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the remarkable success of the series
of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs developed to treat cancer. Despite the excitement, antibody-based drugs do
have a few limitations, including modest stability, lack of oral availability, poor tissue penetration and inability to
reach intracellular targets. Nevertheless, small molecule based PPI inhibitors remain scarce as large PPI
interfaces cannot be efficiently blocked by small molecule drugs. The shortcomings of these two major drug
modalities towards PPI inhibition rekindled people’s interest in peptides as an alternative modality. Peptides, as
a quintessential example of medium-sized molecules, would be able to forge large enough molecular contact to
block a PPI interface. On the other hand, they hold promise to overcome the limitations of antibody drugs,
particularly in terms of oral availability. The enthusiasm in peptide drugs was further fueled by the advent of
genetically encoded screening platforms such as phage display, which enables rapid screening of peptide
libraries. However, phage display often fails to reveal PPI inhibitors of desired potency, presumably due to the
overly simplistic structures of natural peptides in contrast to peptide natural product-based drugs. Over the past
few years, our group have made a number of exciting advances towards expanding the chemical space of phage
display libraries. First, we have developed novel warheads that elicit reversible covalent binding of amines such
as a lysine side chain. Second, we have successfully constructed covalent binding phage libraries and
demonstrated their utility in PPI inhibitor discovery. Third, we have developed highly efficient chemistries for
phage modification to give backbone rigidified peptide macrocycle libraries. These advances pave the road for
the further exploration of phage libraries of complex structured peptides. With this MIRA application, we seek to
develop novel phage libraries that display various covalent warheads and/or backbone rigidifying elements.
These phage libraries will be assessed for PPI inhibitor discovery against a panel of model proteins as well as
proteins that enable bacterial immune evasion or confer antibiotic resistance. Our proposed research will allow,
for the first time, pharmacologic interrogation of host-pathogen PPIs as potential targets of novel antibacterials.
Importantly, the proposed work will yield a powerful platform for discovering non-antibody based PPI inhibitors,
which will have broad impact far beyond the scope of this proposal."

Cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry signals to alter cell fate or metabolism, promote invasive
behavior, or modulate the immune response. EVs show great potential as diagnostic biomarkers for disease
progression, especially in inflammation and cancer. EVs also show promise as a platform for targeted drug
delivery, given their ability to signal to and be taken up by cells. Furthermore, EVs can be degraded via
phagocytosis, providing metabolites to the engulfing cell. Despite the interest in EVs, basic cell biological
knowledge about EV biogenesis, targeting, cargo transfer, and in vivo function is lacking, largely due to the
challenges of imaging <250 nm vesicles that lack specific markers. We pioneered a novel labeling technique
using degron protection assays to specifically label EVs, which allows us to image EVs in vivo using time-lapse
microscopy. We take advantage of the optical transparency and simple genetics of the worm model system C.
elegans for gene discovery and have established the first molecular pathway describing how EVs bud from the
plasma membrane like viruses. We identified conserved proteins that inhibit EV release in worms and human
cells and have generated genetic tools and quantitative assays that enable us to screen for proteins that
promote EV release. We also used degron labeling to determine how large EVs and cell corpses are cleared
by phagocytosis, revealing novel insights into cargo membrane breakdown and phagolysosomal vesiculation
for degradation. Our goals are to determine the molecular interactions of the proteins we identified that
regulate lipid asymmetry and EV budding, to determine the role of phosphatidylethanolamine lipids in EV
budding, to perform genetic screens using sensitized strains to discover novel proteins involved in EV
biogenesis, and thereby define the molecular regulation of EV release. We also plan to use our specific
labeling technique to track individual EVs to determine how EVs interact with cells and transfer cargo,
providing dynamic insights into their functions from developmental signaling to membrane remodeling. We will
also use larger EVs and cell corpses to study how membrane-wrapped cargos are processed inside
phagosomes, especially the role of autophagy-associated Atg8/LC3 lipidation in cargo membrane breakdown.
Breakdown of the EV membrane in endolysosomes may contribute to EV cargo transfer after uptake. This
work has the potential to transform EV production and targeting for drug delivery, as well as to identify key
players in EV biology that can be targeted to influence viral and metastatic spread, diverse diseases, and
homeostasis. Furthermore, defining the mechanisms of phagocytic breakdown is likely to provide insights into
immune modulation and inflammation. Finally, this work on lipid asymmetry is likely to reveal novel aspects of
lipid regulation during key processes from cell fusion to cell division. Thus, our vision is to discover how EV
release is regulated and use this to determine the functional roles of EVs in vivo while also providing
mechanistic insights into diverse proteins and lipids that regulate membrane dynamics."

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated that over 42 million people died globally from non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) in 2019 and they are also of one the leading causes of disability. Africa has one
of the highest burdens of NCDs and related disabilities and Zambia has one of the highest NCD burdens where
it contributes to one in five premature deaths and up to 32% of all deaths annually. We propose a training
program to develop Zambia’s capacity to recognize, measure, and to respond to the chronic health and economic
consequences of major risk factors for NCDs. This program will be based on close collaboration between two
institutions – the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health (GWSPH), USA and
University of Zambia School of Public Health (UNZA-SPH), Zambia to respond to two critical gaps – lack of
trained human resources and lack of data. The overall goal of the United States-Zambia Addressing Risk
Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases in Zambia (US-Zambia Risk-NCD) program is to strengthen
research capacity on the long-term health and economic consequences of major risk factors for NCDs across
the lifespan in Zambia through an innovative model of sustainable capacity development. Our model will use US
expertise to strengthen a Zambian institution, promote a sustainable research enterprise focused on major risk
factors for NCDs and enable dissemination of research to influence policy in Zambia through the following
specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To develop a core group of researchers focused on major risk factors for
NCDs at UNZA. We will offer (1) a long-term training program for trainees from UNZA within the Master of Public
Health (MPH) and Master of Medicine (MMed) degrees at UNZA; (2) short-term training workshops at UNZA-
SPH including both basic and advanced components each year; and (3) online courses and webinars from
GWSPH on key priority topics in measuring the long-term health and economic consequences of risk factors on
NCDs. Specific Aim 2: To promote research around key national priorities for NCDs and risk factors in
Zambia. We will work with trainees to conduct research around three domains: (1) development and use of
national databases relevant to the use, consumption and impact of major NCD risk factors; (2) evaluation of
gender impact on NCDs in Zambia to understand how risk factors for NCDs differ between and among different
genders; and (3) advance implementation research to support identification of locally relevant, effective policies
and interventions for NCDs and their risk factors. Specific Aim 3: To develop NCD risk factor “Research to
Policy (RTP Forum” in Zambia. We will co-host an RTP Symposium in collaboration with the Zambian Ministry
of Health for an annual research-to-policy dialogue on risk factors and NCDs. Specific Aim 4: To create a
formal research unit on NCDs and risk factors in Zambia. We will work on complementing individual training
by working with UNZA to establish a dedicated research unit that provides a home for faculty across UNZA and
enhances sustainability of our efforts."

Role of REV-ERB Proteins in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer’s Disease
Circadian rhythm disruption is observed in Alzheimer’s Disease, and emerging data suggests that circadian
dysfunction may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. However, mechanisms connecting circadian
dysfunction to Alzheimer’s Disease-related neurodegeneration remain unclear. On a molecular level, core
circadian clock genes mediate circadian rhythms, and also serve as critical transcriptional and metabolic
regulators in a variety of organs, including the brain. We have shown that genetic disruption of the circadian
clock by deletion of the master clock gene Bmal1 causes severe gliosis, oxidative damage, and synaptic
degeneration in mouse brain, suggesting a link between core clock function and neurodegeneration. We have
subsequently found that the deletion of REV-ERBα, a component of the core clock which is directly regulated
by BMAL1, also causes spontaneous microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Our data shows that REV-
ERBα expression is suppressed in the cortex of amyloid plaque-bearing APP/PS1 mice, a model of
Alzheimer’s Disease, and in activated microglia. REV-ERBα and its homolog REV-ERBβ are nuclear receptors
which, aside from their function in the circadian clock, have been implicated in regulation of inflammation and
metabolism. We hypothesize that REV-ERBs serve to link the circadian clock to neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration. We will examine the cell-autonomous function of REV-ERBs in regulating microglial
activation and neuroinflammation, and identify transcriptional pathways regulated by REV-ERBs in microglia.
We will determine if REV-ERBs control microglial synaptic phagocytosis in the brain via transcriptional
regulation of complement genes. Because they are nuclear receptors, REV-ERBs can be manipulated
pharmacologically. Thus, we will examine the effects of cell type specific genetic deletion of REV-ERBs, or
activation or inhibition of REV-ERB function with small molecule agonists, on neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease. These studies will shed new light on molecular
mechanisms linking the circadian clock and Alzheimer’s Disease-related neurodegeneration, and illuminate the
novel strategy of directly targeting the circadian clock for neuroprotection."
10898778,"The fundamenal neuroscientific question as to how myelinating glia promote the health of long
axons is greatly understudied. Axons are a particularly vulnerable component of neural circuits
that are irreversibly damaged in early stages of many debilitating neurodegenerative conditions
such as Multiple sclerosis and Alzheimers’ disease. The mechanisms underlying glial
contributions to axonal injury are only pooly understood. Oligodendrocytes (OLGs), the
myelinating glia of the central nervous system, stabilize axonal integrity by poorly understood
trophic mechanisms. Current models suggest that glial metabolism is critical for this support
function, and disrupted metabolic exchange between OLGs and axons, or metabolic deficits in
OLGs may lead to axonal degeneration. In support, we made the exciting discovery that the LKB1
(liver kinase B1) signaling pathway is a crucial metabolic regulator in OLGs, and the inactivation
of LKB1 in these glia results in aberrant mitochondrial energy metabolism and progressive
degeneration of axons. Remarkably, such non-cell-autonomous axon degeneration is not
preceded by changes of OLG structure and myelination, indicating that it occurs secondary to
glial metabolic perturbation. These discoveries lead us to hypothesize that LKB1 and its
downstream metabolic effectors, most notably those regulating mitochondrial metabolism in
OLGs, are integral to the trophic support mechanisms for axons. Using manipulation of LKB1
signaling as an experimental tool to change glial metabolism with no impact on other biological
outputs of OLGs, here we implement a multidisciplinary approach that will afford us the unique
opportunity to pinpoint metabolic alterations in OLGs that disrupt the support of axons. In this
context we will also investigate whether axons degenerate as a consequence of energetic
deprivation, or metabolic poisoining. Together, this will provide valuable data to elucidate which
downstream components of the LKB1-dependent metabolic signaling network in OLGs are
fundamentally important for axon integrity. The proposed efforts may open the door to the
identification of unexpected metabolic components in OLGs that are essential for axon support.
Manipulation of these components will have the potential to promote axon integrity in
neurodegenerative diseases. Because glial and metabolic abnormalities associated with axon
degeneration can be observed in many neurodegenerative conditions, this approach has the
potential for wide-ranging therapeutic impact."
10783735,"Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNA provides an important means of genetic control and is a crucial
step in the expression of most genes. AS gives rise to multiple isoforms that can exhibit differential stabilities,
molecular binding capabilities, and phenotypic effects, thereby greatly expanding the functional capacity of
genes. These functions are frequently deregulated in human disease, leading to aberrantly expressed isoforms
that can act as drivers and “rewirers” of cellular pathways. Given the intrinsic role of AS in nearly every aspect
of biology, tools and technologies for the functional understanding of isoforms are desperately needed.
Unfortunately, prediction of isoform functions are notoriously difficult, due to our only crude understanding of
the molecular determinants of isoform activities as well as a paucity of experimental datasets annotated at
isoform resolution. The experiments, in turn, are challenging in their own right, due to a lack of robust methods
for the detection, mapping, and phenotyping at isoform-resolution in vivo. As a consequence, one of the
biggest gaps in the genomics and proteomics fields is an understanding the functional and evolutionary
implications of the astonishing complexity of the human proteome.
To make progress towards this gap, we must reformulate existing approaches. Here, we propose to build
computational and experimental methodologies that are intertwined across the entire development and
evaluation lifecycle. Computational approaches, capitalizing on ever-improving machine learning algorithms,
can predict the effect of AS at high coverage. Experimental validation, on the other hand, is critical to
benchmark the predictions as well as shed light on heretofore uncharacterized features of isoform functionality.
The goals of this project are to develop (i) a predictor of protein isoform stability, a “first line of evidence” and
prerequisite of isoform functionality, (ii) a novel bioinformatics approach to study the “rewiring” effects of AS
isoforms on protein interactions, and (iii) a novel measure, the alternative splicing impact factor, that predicts
the functional role of an isoform based on metrics such as the loss of interaction and expression patterns, and
apply this concept to determine AS-induced phenotypes in-silico and in vitro/vivo (cell-based assay). Each
computational stage will be closely complemented with a highly customized and novel experimental approach–
large-scale isoform proteogenomics, interactomics, and functional assays experiments–to validate and
benchmark the predictors, as well as feed into an iterative computation-experimental “virtuous cycle”."
10783737,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a sporadic neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a facial port-wine
birthmark and leptomeningeal vascular malformation (LVM). SWS most often (85%) affects one cerebral
hemisphere and has a progressive but highly variable clinical course, thus providing a unique clinical model to
study the neurocognitive effects of an early, postnatal, unilateral brain lesion. Most children with SWS develop
seizures during the first 2 years of life and also develop neurological symptoms as well as cognitive
impairment. Currently, SWS has no cure or specific treatment. With NIH support and nationwide patient
recruitment, we have built a clinical imaging research program for children with SWS, in order to understand
the pathophysiology of progression and find new diagnostic and treatment paradigms. We have tested novel
MRI approaches for more accurate detection of SWS-related brain abnormalities and identified critical age
windows when most of the progressive brain damage occurs. Recently, we have also identified two, potentially
powerful compensatory mechanisms that may prevent severe neurocognitive complications of SWS-related
brain injury: (i) a deep venous vascular remodeling in the ipsilateral (SWS-affected) hemisphere, and (ii)
reorganization in the contralateral hemisphere affecting both verbal and non-verbal cognitive functions. We
also identified a subgroup of children with SWS whose cognitive functions improved over time, presumably due
to effective compensatory processes. In Aim 1 of this renewal proposal, we will test the application of a
recently developed rapid MRI protocol (called STAGE) for safe and accurate early screening and late follow-up
of brain vascular and parenchymal abnormalities. This new, innovative imaging approach is widely applicable
and could change clinical practice for SWS imaging, used as a screening technique in preventive trials, and be
utilized in other pediatric neurological diseases. In Aim 2, we will extend our previous studies to older children
and young adults with SWS to use susceptibility-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging connectivity
studies to evaluate the role of vascular remodeling and structural brain reorganization, respectively, in the
preservation and reorganization of motor symptoms and specific cognitive functions that can be targeted by
interventions. In Aim 3, we will use SWS epilepsy surgical tissue to harvest cells from both the LVM and
various parenchymal cells and utilize a laser capture microdissection approach to identify specific cell types
harboring the somatic GNAQ mutation. We will also study the imaging correlates and associated protein
changes associated with dysregulated angiogenesis. The expected findings could fundamentally shape our
concept as to how this mutation can lead to brain pathology and will also identify novel treatment targets."

Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome due to infection, is common in hospitalized patients and
leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Over 1.7 million patients develop sepsis in the United States
each year, a number that will increase as the population ages. Patients with sepsis contribute to over $24 billion
in healthcare costs yearly, and a recent study found that sepsis contributed to up to half of hospital deaths.
Furthermore, survivors of sepsis suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Therefore,
improving the care of patients with sepsis would be enormously beneficial to society. However, there are several
critical gaps in the field that need to be addressed: 1) delays in identifying infected patients are common and
associated with increased mortality; 2) errors in risk stratification of patients with impending critical illness and
sepsis are common and deadly; 3) current treatment strategies for infected patients utilize a one-size-fits-all
approach, which neglects the wide range of clinical presentations and underlying biology due to the complex
interactions between patient characteristics, the infectious organism, and the host immune response.
The overall vision of the PI’s research program is to address these knowledge gaps by utilizing detailed
multicenter electronic health record (EHR), clinical trial, and biomarker data combined with machine learning
approaches to improve the identification, risk stratification, and discover important subphenotypes of sepsis to
decrease preventable death from infection. Over the past five years, the PI has successfully secured independent
funding through an NIGMS R01 and Department of Defense award. The PI has published over 80 peer-reviewed
publications during this time, is an active member on several national and international committees, has
participated in several NIH study sections, and has 40 mentees, including six with NIH K-level awards.
Importantly, the PI has also developed and implemented a machine learning risk stratification tool, called eCART,
in over 20 hospitals, which has decreased mortality in high-risk ward patients. The goal of the next five years is
to build upon these successes and address key gaps in the field through three future directions: 1) using natural
language processing and deep learning to improve the identification and risk stratification of infected patients, 2)
identifying important subphenotypes using research biomarkers, and 3) using machine learning to develop
personalized treatment algorithms. These projects are innovative because they will utilize advanced machine
learning methods in a large, multicenter collection of structured and unstructured EHR and biomarker data for
developing novel tools in patients with sepsis. In the future, these models will be implemented for earlier
identification, accurate risk stratification, and to deliver personalized care at the bedside. This has the potential
to revolutionize the care of one of the most common and deadly conditions in hospitalized patients."

T helper cells (Th1 and Th17) play an important role in bone homeostasis through regulating osteoclast (OC)
formation in autoimmune diseases and OVX-induced osteoporosis. However, how these T cells interactions
with bone cells disrupt bone homeostasis during aging to cause bone loss in age-related osteoporosis
(AROP) remains poorly understood. We reported that TGFβ1 (Tβ1) is a major bone loss-causing cytokine in
AROP. It induces lysosomal degradation of TRAF3, a receptor adaptor protein that negatively regulates NF-κB
activation, in mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) to directly inhibit bone formation. However, the release of
active Tβ1 from resorbing bone is limited because of low bone turnover in AROP. We have identified a novel
subset of CD11b+F4/80+Ly6ChiLy6G- macrophages expressing membrane-bound Tβ1 (mbTβ1), which we call
MbTβ1Macs, whose numbers are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of aged mice. MbTβ1Macs also express
ITGB8 which can directly activate mTβ1. MbTβ1Macs have less potential to form OCs, but significantly inhibit
osteoblast (OB) differentiation. Th1 cells expressing IFN-γ and senescent/immune checkpoint PD-1 are also
increased in the BM of aged mice. IFN-γ induces Ly6Chi macrophages to express mbTβ1, which in turn
stimulates Th1 cells producing IFN-γ and PD-1 in vitro, associated with reduced levels of TRAF3. These effects
are blocked by the FDA approved lysosomal inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Our proposed studies will 1)
determine if ITGB8 activates mbTβ1 in MbTβ1Macs to inhibit bone formation during aging; 2) determine if IFN-
γ polarizes MbTβ1Macs, which in turn promote Th1 cell senescence with enhanced production of inflammatory
factors via Tβ1 induction of TRAF3 lysosomal degradation in aged mice; and 3) evaluate if our recently
patented bone-targeted HCQ, with dual anti-resorptive and anabolic effects in an OVX-induced osteoporotic
model, can prevent and treat AROP and low level chronic inflammation during age by blocking the reciprocal
interactions between macrophages and Th1 cells. Completion of the proposed studies will identify novel
mechanisms to explain the disruption of bone homeostasis during aging through reciprocal interactions
between macrophages and Th1 cells, in which this novel subset of macrophages inhibits bone formation and
causes BM low-level chronic inflammation by stimulating Th1 cells to produce inflammatory factors.
Importantly, it will provide proof of principle that a bone-targeted HCQ may be a novel treatment for AROP."
10894831,"Abstract
Development of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) is one of the significant challenges of current approved
cancer therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of targeting anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD1/PDL1. Immune-
mediated enterocolitis or inflammatory bowel disease is one of the most frequent and problematic irAE
associated with ICI therapy (simplistically termed “ICI-colitis” in the grant). The development of severe ICI-
associated enterocolitis is the most frequent cause of ICI therapy cessation and significant morbidity, which
inevitably impedes the clinical benefits of ICI therapy. The underlying mechanism of ICI-colitis remains poorly
understood. Due to the lack of mechanistic understanding, current treatment of ICI-colitis was empirically
adopted from the approaches for the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), using corticosteroids as the
1st line treatment and targeted anti-TNFα or anti-α4β7 integrin as the 2nd line treatment for corticosteroid failures.
For patients with severe ICI-colitis, this approach frequently resulted in a significant delay in resuming ICI therapy
or forced permanent cessation of ICI therapy, owing to the complications of corticosteroid use itself. Clearly, it is
imperative to understand the molecular and cellular pathways of ICI-colitis to guide a more scientific and effective
management and to achieve better clinical outcomes. In our preliminary studies with colon biopsies from a small
cohort (n=18) of ICI-colitis patients, we discovered that ICI-colitis presented two subtypes by molecular pathology
and the associated responsiveness to corticosteroid treatment. One subtype has the signature of CD8 T cell
cytotoxicity in the colon and responsiveness to corticosteroids, whereas the other subtype has the molecular
signature of the idiopathic IBD and is refractory to corticosteroids but responsive to the 2nd line treatment. The
former type was associated with elevated tumor-secreted circulating soluble NKG2D ligand sMIC in the colon
and elevated serum IL-18. Notably, we have established unique animal models to recapitulate the sMIC-
associated ICI-colitis subtype. With our novel clinical findings and unique animal models, the objectives of this
proposed study are: 1) to establish clinically achievable biochemical parameters that can be used to guide a
more effective treatment of ICI-colitis through leveraging a larger cohort of archived clinically-annotated ICI-colitis
patient samples; 2) to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the subset of ICI-colitis
associated with elevated circulating sMIC and IL-18; and 3) to explore more beneficial treatments for sMIC-
associated ICI-colitis preclinically. Through the perpetual dialogue between human samples and mouse models,
we anticipate that our study will provide the rationales for multi-institutional large cohort clinical trials to validate
the parameters for guiding a more effective ICI-colitis management and for a more beneficial therapy to treat ICI-
colitis in a subset of patients."
10877970,"Single-stranded circular RNAs (circRNA) are enriched in cancers, yet the regulation and biological function
of most circRNA remains unclear. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of both human
papillomavirus (HPV)-derived and endogenous circRNAs in both infectious and neoplastic diseases. The
specific goal of this proposal is to generate a more comprehensive understanding of the function and
regulation of circRNA that are present in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Our central
hypothesis is that many circRNA are coding RNA that differ in regulation and function from their
corresponding full-length RNAs in ways that promote the development of HNSCC. In preliminary studies,
we have developed innovative circRNA-Seq and Polysome RNA-Seq protocols and found that many
circRNA with coding potential are enriched in HNSCC tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor mucosa. In
addition, our discovery of HPV16 circular E7 RNA (circE7), which is translated to the E7 oncoprotein, offers
a novel tool to understand the mechanistic and physiological regulation of circRNA formation and function.
With these innovative tools and extensive preliminary evidence supporting feasibility, we propose to expand
our understanding of circRNAs in HNSCC in three related aims. First, a comprehensive transcriptomic
profile from up to 50 HPV+ and 50 HPV- HNSCC tumors and adjacent tissue will be generated, including
RNA-Seq approaches that enrich for circRNAs. Moreover, circRNA identified in this transcriptomic profiling
and circE7 will be assessed for their potential as prognostic biomarkers in a validation cohort of archived
HNSCC. Second, using the HPV16 circE7 locus, we will determine the cis and trans elements that regulate
circRNA formation in HNSCC and determine how they are physiologically regulated. Third, we will combine
HNSCC circRNA-Seq datasets with recently completed polysome RNA-Seq to identify endogenous circRNA
that are likely to be translated. These prioritized candidates will be validated and characterized through
rigorously controlled overexpression and knockdown experiments including the use of circRNA-derived
specific peptide antibodies. The investigative team includes experts in circRNA metabolism, HPV biology,
pathology, statistical genetics, head and neck cancer, and epidemiology, thus ensuring we have the skills
and resources to execute the proposal. Completion of the proposal will provide both a global and detailed
understanding of circRNA and their regulation in HNSCC."
10889259,"Plasmodium falciparum control has stalled, and further progress reducing infections and deaths will require a
highly-effective malaria vaccine. Individuals exposed to malaria develop protective immune responses
gradually over several infections. Studies of immune responses to P. falciparum have consistently
demonstrated that targets which exhibit very high diversity are critical for these protective responses. However,
immunity to these antigens is dominated by strain-specific responses, which confer partial but imperfect
protection to heterologous strains. This is a challenge for current vaccine candidates, including the first
licensed malaria vaccine RTS,S, which are based on a single antigenic variant for a protein target and suffer
from reduced efficacy to non-vaccine strains. There is evidence for strain-transcendent immunity in naturally
exposed populations where individuals mount broadly protective responses after a few infections, despite the
presence of dozens if not hundreds of different strains. Understanding how to elicit strain-transcendent
immunity towards key, diverse antigenic targets has the potential to transform the next generation of vaccine
products. Prior longitudinal studies of infection and disease are unable to furnish this insight mainly because
they suffer from the inability to distinguish protection from lack of exposure in naturally exposed populations.
As a consequence, there is no clear phenotype of protection, producing an incomplete understanding of the
acquisition of protective immunity. Using our unique, longstanding cohort encompassing ~600 people in 75
households (initiated in 2017) in a high-transmission community in Western Kenya, we are able to pinpoint
parasite transmission events to the individual-level, characterize the variant composition of multi-strain P.
falciparum exposures, and document the outcome (no infection or protected vs. infected with or without
symptoms) at the variant level. By leveraging known exposures to clearly define protection phenotypes within a
natural system that encompasses a high degree of parasite diversity, we are uniquely-positioned to answer
longstanding questions about protective immune responses. The goal of the proposed work is to use our
unique system to advance multi-variant vaccine design. In our first Aim, we will quantify the strain-specific risk
of malaria infection following a confirmed infectious bite (exposure). In the second Aim, we will leverage peri-
exposure and post-exposure samples to correlate strain-specific protection following an infectious bite with
strain-specific immune responses in order to identify strain-transcendent responses, and then identify variants
that most effectively promote strain-transcendent responses. Our hypothesis is that a minimum set of strain-
specific immune responses will be associated with strain-transcendent protection from infection after exposure.
By exploring heterologous versus homologous strain-specific responses to elucidate a minimum set of
antigenic variants required to confer strain-transcendent protection, we can facilitate the development and
delivery of the next generation of P. falciparum vaccines."
10906386,"Oxidative stress has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic and chronic kidney disease
(DKD/CKD). Most of the previous studies focused on either a singular concept of oxidative stress vs
antioxidant balance, or centered on overproduction of superoxide as a major reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and a primary event in DKD/CKD. However, superoxide has major kinetic and biochemical barriers that limit its
impacts on biological structures. We propose a key role for less reactive, more specific and membrane
diffusible molecules which are also tightly related to changes in cell metabolism – (phospho)lipid peroxides
(LOOH). While the basic tenets of lipid peroxidation are established in biology, the molecular entity, modes of
action and specific redox signaling ability of LOOH are more enigmatic. This is a critical gap to address
because impeding a highly specific form of redox signal at the right timing in disease pathogenesis can prevent
renal cell dysfunction. Our central hypothesis is that LOOH are key metabolic signals that transmit an initial
redox stress in cells. Furthermore, we propose that diabetes alters the molecular signature of LOOH and that
from a myriad of diverse oxidized phospholipids, there are only a few specific ones that dictate the activation of
programmed cell death. We focus on proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTC) which comprise ~ 70-80 % of the
cortex, where we previously discovered that dysregulation of PTC metabolism potentiates LOOH production.
We have a broad array of preliminary data showing that when PTC metabolism is challenged either by lipid
overload or by ablating the neutralizing mechanism for membrane peroxides via deletion of glutathione
peroxidase 4 (GPx4), LOOH are overproduced and mice develop kidney injury. Using diabetic models, we
show that diabetes not only potentiates the formation of LOOH, but also alters the molecular signature of
LOOH species in a fashion that oxidized phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine
(LPE) become abundant. Three aims will test the hypothesis using state-of-the-art biophysical and mass
spectrometry imaging methods in combination with pharmacologic and transgenic approaches using both
established and newly generated mouse models. In Aim 1, we will test the prediction that changes in PTC
metabolic activity regulates the production of LOOH. Aim 2 will explore mechanisms through which diabetes
potentiates the production of specific oxygenated phospholipids. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis, that
selective oxidation of phospholipid species dictates the activation of renal cell death programs. The
experimental strategy combines PTC-specific transgenic models, obese CKD and diabetic DKD models, using
targeted compounds to delinate originating sources of redox stress and advanced redox phospholipidomics
and biophysical approaches. Outcomes from this proposal will establish a new, more specific view of redox
stress in CKD/DKD and link specific oxidized (phospho)lipids to PTC injury and demise, paving the way to
highly specific anti-apoptotic or anti-ferroptotic interventions in the future."
10907531,"Abstract
In recent years, the number of neurons that we can record simultaneously has seen an exponential
increase, presenting a daunting challenge: how do we analyze these complex and high-dimensional
datasets to gain insight into how neural circuits perform computation? Tools from dynamical systems
theory have successfully unraveled the computational machinery of artificial recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) trained to perform goal-directed tasks. If we could apply these tools to biological neural circuits,
it would provide unparalleled access to the inner workings of the brain and potentially allow us to
connect theories of neural computation to real biological data. However, for these tools to be useful,
we need to create in silico replicas whose dynamics faithfully represent the dynamics of the underlying
biological system.
 To date, the best in silico replicas of biological networks are RNNs trained to produce output that
matches recorded patterns of neuronal firing. While this approach is rapidly growing in popularity, it has
critical flaws. Current training methodologies are not constrained to produce accurate representations
of the underlying dynamics; in fact, RNNs are actually rewarded for inventing superfluous dynamics, so
long as those dynamics help to reproduce recorded neural data. Additionally, these models often
assume that the relationship (“embedding”) between latent activity and neural firing rates is linear; when
this assumption proves false, the dynamical accuracy suffers. The problems of superfluous dynamics
and non-linear embedding are especially severe when attempting to model a system of interacting
neural circuits.
 The objective of this proposal is to develop a novel artificial neural network architecture that
addresses the above challenges and allows our in-silico models to capture accurate dynamics that are
built both within and across-circuits. My approach combines two key components: 1) neural ordinary
differential equations (NODEs), a computational architecture that we have demonstrated learns
dynamics more accurately and compactly than RNNs and 2) invertible neural network (INN) readouts,
which eliminate superfluous dynamics and allow the model to approximate nonlinear embeddings. I will
validate the ability of this model, called an Ordinary Differential equation auto-encoder with Invertible
readout (ODIN), to find accurate within- and across-circuit dynamics using synthetic neural data and
previously-collected multi-electrode recordings from monkeys. This tool will help to build a bridge
between neural data and both local and distributed neural computations."

 The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates of up to 6 million American children with
food allergies (roughly 2 in every classroom) at an economic cost of ~$25 billion per year. Currently, there are
limited FDA-approved treatment options for food allergy, with food avoidance remaining the only safe option. A
better understanding of the immune mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying food allergy is clearly
warranted to permit development of new effective and safe therapies8.
 Over the last funded period our team identified “canonical” goblet cell antigen passages (GAPs) that act
to deliver dietary antigens to discrete immunological niches and imprint antigen presenting cells (APCs) with
tolerogenic properties to promote immune tolerance. Furthermore, we showed that the food allergic condition
was associated with altered gut antigen passage patterning and landscape. These IL-13/IL-4R-dependent
“non-canonical” antigen passages were required for induction of IgE-MC reactions.
 In preliminary studies we demonstrate that systemic activation of the IL-13/IL-4R-signaling pathway is
sufficient to promote the outgrowth of SI pro-type-2 GC subpopulation, which express genes associated with
dietary antigen recognition and a distinct pro-type-2 inflammatory phenotype and form antigen passages.
Strikingly, we provide a link between disruption of skin barrier and pro-Type 2 cytokine production with increased
gut IL-13-producing ILC2 cells and a shift in gastrointestinal antigen passage landscape from the “canonical” to
“non-canonical” antigen passages. The current gap in knowledge is the requirement of pro-type-2 GCs to food
allergen passage and directing the allergic inflammatory response to the gut (allergic gut tropism) and priming
for food reactivity.
 We hypothesize that SI pro-type 2 GCs act as non-canonical antigen passages, drive allergic gut tropism
and clinical reactivity to foods. To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific Aims (SA); SA1) Define the role
of systemic Type-2 signals in GI pro-type 2 GC-antigen passage formation; SA2) Define the role of GI pro-type
2 GC antigen passages in allergic gut tropism and SA3) Define the requirement of GI pro-type 2 GC antigen
passage-induced allergic gut tropism in food reactivity. With respect to the expected outcomes, the studies
proposed in SA1 are expected to demonstrate GI pro-type 2 GC antigen passages; SA2 demonstrate that GI
pro-type 2 GCs direct antigens to sensitizing LP-DC populations and recruit the food antigen-specific CD4+ Th2
cell response to GI tract and SA3) identify the requirement for GI pro-type 2 GCs in allergic gut tropism and
clinical reactivity.
 Successfully completing the proposed studies will provide a new and substantive departure from our
current understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of dietary food allergen passage across the
intestinal epithelium underpinning a critical role for GI pro-type 2 GCs in allergic gut tropism and food reactivity
and warrant therapeutic targeting of pro-type 2 GCs for prevention of food allergic reactions."
10784709,"Project Summary
Hematogenous metastasis is responsible for a large majority of cancer-related deaths, where circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) shed from the primary tumor into the peripheral blood (PB). A small number of CTCs may form
secondary sites, which are extremely difficult to control clinically. Most methods for studying CTCs rely on
drawing and analyzing fractionally small PB blood samples (“liquid biopsy”). Although CTCs and multicellular
CTC clusters (CTCCs) have been studied for decades, little is known about their “dynamics” in vivo (transient
changes in their numbers in PB), and how these may affect metastasis development and response to anti-cancer
treatment. For example, it is know that radiation therapy may encourage metastatic dissemination of cancer, yet
the mechanisms for this are still poorly understood.
 Our team recently developed a new method for in vivo enumeration of CTCs in small animals called “diffuse
in vivo flow cytometry” (DiFC). DiFC uses diffuse light to detect fluorescent-protein expressing CTCs in large,
deeply-seated blood vessels. DiFC can sample approximately 100 microliters of blood per minute, permitting
detection of fewer than 1 CTC per mL of PB, and sampling of the entire peripheral blood volume in minutes. We
previously used DiFC to study rare CTC and CTCC dissemination in mouse xenograft models. DiFC revealed
that CTC numbers are highly dynamic and may change by an order-of-magnitude or more over 24 hour periods.
These changes are largely missed by CTC enumeration methods that involve infrequent blood draws.
 The goal of this project is to build a “wearable” tethered w-DiFC instrument that will allow continuous, non-
invasive monitoring of CTC numbers over extended periods in mice. The w-DiFC optical probe and signal
processing design will permit data collection in freely-moving mice in ambient lighting conditions. We will first
use w-DiFC to study CTC dynamics during disease development in an orthotopic xenograft and transgenic mouse
model of metastasis.
 We will use also w-DiFC to measure continuous CTC dynamics after radiation therapy in a medulloblastoma
(MB) mouse model. MB is a common form of childhood brain cancer that aggressively metastasizes to the
leptomeningeal surfaces of the brain and spine via the PB. There is significant evidence that radiation may
exacerbate metastasis by triggering mobilization of CTCs into the blood. We expect that the ability of w-DiFC to
measure CTCs over short-, medium-, and long-term timescales will provide unique insights into this process. We
will also use w-DiFC to study the use of anti-inflammatory drugs to block the pro-metastatic effect. Hence, the
studies proposed here could ultimately lead to better understanding of metastasis and improved treatment
protocols for childhood MB. We anticipate that the unique technologies that will be developed here will have
broad application to other cancers and anti-cancer therapies in the future."
10784750,"Data and technology have been instrumental in furthering our understanding of human health, including
many benign urologic diseases. Studies employing next-generation sequencing technologies found evidence of
bacterial and viral communities in the urine of healthy women and men, debunking the myth that “urine is sterile.”
Similarly, data has been instrumental in improving patient care. Mining of electronical medical records has
uncovered associations between lower urinary tract symptoms and patient populations, identifying new
opportunities and procedures to improve patient quality of life. The NIDDK-funded Loyola Urinary Education and
Research Collaborative (LUEREC) has been at the forefront of research in pelvic floor disorders, harnessing
data to drive discovery. Our translational research team includes surgeon scientists and basic scientists with
complementary expertise in lower urinary tract disorders, microbiology, and informatics.
 The proposed program will engage undergraduate (rising Junior and Senior) and recent post-baccalaureate
trainees in hands-on research in benign urologic diseases at Loyola University Chicago. Over 12-weeks, cohorts
of 6 trainees will work closely with student, faculty, and clinical researchers in the LUEREC community. We have
identified three educational aims for the proposed training program. Trainees will:
 • Aim 1: Gain exposure to current research areas in benign urologic disease,
 • Aim 2: Establish proficiency conducting hypothesis-driven research, and
 • Aim 3: Develop skills to synthesize, interpret and present scientific research.
 Formal training in benign urologic disease research and data science will be blended with hands-on
experience. This transdisciplinary training will provide trainees with in-demand skills for future careers in
biomedicine. Trainees will work in small groups, thus facilitating peer-learning. Enrichment activities have been
designed to provide trainees with exposure to research and careers in urology, as well as to graduate and
medical school. The proposed program also includes several formal and informal training activities to develop
the skills necessary to effectively present scientific research; each trainee will produce two written documents of
his/her research over the course of the 12-week program, in addition to oral and poster presentations.
 Recruitment for the proposed project will be conducted at a national level, enhancing diversity of the cohort,
based upon racial and ethnic background, gender, and/or financial resources. Loyola University Chicago is
committed to increasing diversity in undergraduate and graduate education while delivering the premier
undergraduate educational experience in Chicago. The proposed program administration is passionate about
education and is recognized for their dedication to teaching and mentorship with numerous awards and honors.
Through the proposed mentored research experiences, trainees will enrich their college education while gaining
first-hand exposure to careers in benign urologic disease research."
10784751,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunction of
the BBB is common to several neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and brain
tumors, where brain endothelial cells (BECs) lose barrier properties, gain fenestrations, and increase
permeability. Significantly, the BBB prevents the free exchange of many therapeutic agents, presenting a
challenging problem for the treatment of many neurological diseases. Conversely, when the BBB is compromised
in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, brain tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis, inflammatory
conditions often result in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, contributing to the pathology of the disease.
Therefore, a fundamental understanding of BBB formation is essential to provide therapeutic insights into treating
these diseases. During BBB development, there is a coordinated effort between CNS angiogenesis and
barriergenesis (i.e. the acquisition of BBB properties). While both processes are dependent upon signals within
the developing CNS, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive BBB formation are only beginning
to be elucidated. Our overall objective is to bridge the gap in this knowledge. Our proposal is innovative because
we: 1) identified zebrafish mutants with defective brain vasculature; 2) demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling
is sufficient for barriergenesis in the absence of Vegf signaling; 3) determined that activated canonical Wnt
signaling in neural progenitor cells inhibits CNS angiogenesis; and 4) identified regulatory elements that may
suppress fenestrations in BECs. Based upon our compelling preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that
canonical Wnt signaling regulates Vegf signaling and the acquisition of barrier properties in BECs using both cell
autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim
1) canonical Wnt signaling regulates cell autonomous Vegf signaling in BECs, but that Vegf signaling can drive
CNS angiogenesis in the absence of canonical Wnt signaling; (Aim 2) activated canonical Wnt signaling in neural
progenitor cells inhibits the development of the BBB; and (Aim 3) regulatory elements within the plvap promoter
suppress fenestrations in BECs, but not peripheral endothelial cells. Our proposed studies establish an
innovative approach to discover new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate CNS
angiogenesis and barriergenesis. Our long-term goals are to use this information to develop new strategies that
permit the controlled access of therapeutic agents into the CNS and repair damaged or dysfunctional barriers
associated with the pathology of neurological diseases."
10765473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cholesterol is a central molecule in human health, serving as a precursor for active metabolites, a specific ligand
for proteins, and a determinant of membrane architecture. Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism has wide-
reaching consequences and is a hallmark of nearly every major human disease, including neurodegeneration,
cancer, and immune disorders. Despite the immense roles of cholesterol and its metabolites in human health,
their molecular signaling mechanisms remain largely unknown. The main barrier to understanding and targeting
cholesterol metabolites in therapy is our lack of tools to define their precise interactions. To address this gap,
we have established innovative cholesterol metabolite probes that contain functionalities for chemoproteomics-
based target identification and microscopy-based subcellular localization. We have used these probes to
quantitatively profile the proteome-wide interactomes of oxysterol metabolites and specify their roles in specific
processes of cancer and immunity. Importantly, our tools have uncovered highly selective protein interactors,
including the tumorigenic and neuroactive sigma-2 orphan receptor (TMEM97), providing new opportunities to
target cholesterol metabolite activities in disease. Over the next 5 years, we will build upon our established tools
and technologies to interrogate oncogenic, immunomodulatory, and neuroactive cholesterol metabolites as well
as cholesterol itself. Specifically, we will design a next-generation chemoproteomics platform for multiplexed
cholesterol metabolite target profiling and pioneer an integrated fluorescence microscopy approach for
subcellular cholesterol metabolite imaging. Our tools and technologies will revolutionize the analysis of
cholesterol metabolite interactions, advancing cholesterol metabolism as a druggable target in human disease."

and thriving educational and mentoring programs that we have established within the musculoskeletal programs
at the CMCVAMC in the Translational Musculoskeletal Research Center (TMRC) and through our collaborations
with the Atlanta VA Medical Center (AVAMC). The CReATE Motion Center will include investigators with
expertise in musculoskeletal regeneration, pain, cell-based therapies, biomanufacturing, and translational
sciences drawn from Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, the Department of Medicine, Bioengineering, and
Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the CMC VAMC and the University of Pennsylvania (its primary affiliate)
and the Atlanta VAMC and Emory University (its primary affiliate).
The Mission of our CReATE Motion Center is to develop a translational pipeline for advanced cartilage and
joint regenerative therapies aimed at treating arthritis, joint injuries, and related joint disorders, by cultivating
core infrastructure and building an intellectual critical mass in this area. We will apply this framework to
accelerate the clinical implementation of cutting-edge strategies to restore joint function and transform the
long-term health of our Veterans.
Our new CReATE Motion Center is focused on 3 major interacting research cores (RCs) that support 3 central
research focus areas (RFAs) and our educational and outreach mission. The Research Cores will focus on
Biomanufacturing and Translation (RC1), Rehabilitative Models and Tools (RC2), and Advancing Clinical
Evaluation (RC3). These Cores support the three main CReATE Motion Research Focus Areas, centered on
Molecules and Delivery Systems (RFA1), Cells and Cell Products (RFA2), and Biologic Joint Resurfacing’
(RFA3). CReATE Motion will fund Pilot Awards and Collaborative Exchanges in each of the 3 research focus
areas through a peer-reviewed mechanism. Taken Together, CReATE Motion, with its associated Cores,
Trainee, and Pilot Funding, is designed to produce new knowledge, novel products, and advances in clinical
care, with a specific focus on functional restoration of the musculoskeletal system.
Equally important to advancing the scientific and translational underpinnings of CReATE Motion is the training
of the next generation of VA-focused scientists and clinicians working in this research space and engaging
Veterans. To that end, our Educational and Outreach (E&O) mission includes (1) a Fellowship Program in
Translational Tissue Engineering & Regenerative Medicine (“T-TERM”) to educate trainees and the community
on processes of clinical translation and commercialization, (2) regular Techniques Workshops & Chalk Talks to
increase collaboration and interactions across the Center and utilization of Core resources, (3) a Seminar Series
focused on CReATE Motion related topics and translation, and most importantly (4) a focus on Patient Education,
Outreach, and Engagement to bring technologies and information to the Veterans that we serve.
If successful, this new CReATE Motion Center will establish a critical mass of expertise, a culture of innovation,

10765410,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The research proposal aims to investigate the novel regulatory sequences and elements underlying novel
phenotypes, to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of morphological and cellular innovation. The
evolution of morphological structures and traits is complex, and the origins and genetic mechanisms that drive
the development of new cell types, tissues, and organs are not fully understood. Our long-term goal is to uncover
the processes that govern morphological and functional diversity and complexity, which is a crucial step in
understanding the evolution of complex life. Despite progress in this field, our current understanding is still
limited. The goal of this research is to understand the origins of novel regulatory sequences and elements, how
they are integrated into regulatory networks to contribute to genic and phenotypic innovation, and further impact
evolution. To accomplish this, the laboratory has two major focuses: the study of how new genes and
phenotypes, including expression phenotypes, are regulated, and the deciphering of the principles of sex-biased
regulation from an evolutionary biological perspective. The first part of the proposed research aims to investigate
the mechanisms governing the gain of expression of evolutionarily young genes in Drosophila. Specifically, the
project will focus on the regulatory basis of new genes in Drosophila and using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to
pinpoint enhancers and promoters for new genes and new expression. Additionally, the project will investigate
the mechanism of pre-meiotic dosage compensation and identify putative novel players. The second part of the
proposed research will focus on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for sex-biased novel expression. This
will include using deep learning to reveal the basis of sex-biased chromatin accessibility, investigating the origin
of novel enhancers from poised sequences, and studying the role of distant enhancers in gene expression
novelties and sex-biased novelties. Overall, this project will use cutting-edge techniques and approaches to gain
insight into the mechanisms that drive the evolution of new genes and their expression patterns in Drosophila.
This study will provide important insights into the evolution of transcription regulatory networks and their
contributions to novel traits, including expression phenotypes. Altogether, our integrative approach will help to
elucidate the origination and evolution of novel regulatory circuits and their contributions to phenotypic innovation
and evolution."

Pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria interact with animal hosts and protect themselves from external and host
environments—other microbes, host-defense cells, toxic molecules, and importantly, therapeutic antibiotics—by
adhering to each other and/or to surfaces in communities known as biofilms. Biofilm formation [1] facilitates
adherence to a variety of surfaces, including host tissues and abiotic surfaces such as medical implants, [2]
provides a reservoir from which bacteria can disperse to seed infections at other sites, and [3] imparts protection
both via a self-produced extracellular matrix comprised of polysaccharides and other macromolecules and by the
cells being physiologically distinct from each other and from free-living, planktonic cells. As a result, human
infections that involve a biofilm remain challenging to treat. Thus, understanding how bacteria form and disperse
from biofilms in the context of an animal is a critical area of research. While numerous models exist, few provide
all the advantages found with the symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its squid host (Euprymna
scolopes), in which successful colonization depends on both biofilm formation and dispersal. Using this model,
we can [1] visualize the biofilms formed by V. fischeri on the surface of the symbiotic (light) organ and from
which it must disperse to enter to colonize spaces deep inside, [2] quantify the resulting colonization outcome,
and [3] evaluate roles of specific genes and assess gene expression in situ. Our work has shown that the
underlying mechanisms determined in the lab are also at play in the animal. We have found that both host-
associated biofilm formation and colonization depends on the production by V. fischeri of a matrix comprised of
SYP polysaccharide. Strains that fail to produce it fail to form symbiotic biofilms and are defective at colonizing
while those with an enhanced ability to produce this SYP-dependent matrix are superior in their ability to do
both. We have identified syp, an 18-gene locus required for production of SYP, multiple regulators that control
syp transcription and post-transcriptional events, and signals that activate or prevent SYP production. We have
determined that a large adhesive protein, LapV, is critical for production of SYP-dependent biofilms; dispersal
requires that LapV is cleaved from the cell surface. We have also identified additional biofilm and/or dispersal
factors whose roles are currently under investigation. We propose here to address key questions that will advance
our understanding of animal-relevant biofilm formation and dispersal, including when and where is SYP
produced during colonization? Is it shed upon dispersal? How and where do the signals that are known to control
SYP production function in the context of host colonization? How do specific regulators and signals function to
control biofilm formation and/or dispersal? Are the underlying mechanisms common to different isolates of V.
fischeri? We anticipate that work will provide necessary insights into mechanisms by which bacteria transition
in and out of multi-cellular communities within an animal host."
10765414,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transposable elements (TEs), like viruses, are genetic parasites. They use their host’s cellular machinery to
replicate and must replicate faster than their host to avoid extinction. Replication of TEs in host cells causes
damaging mutations: TE insertions can inactivate host genes and cause chromosomal rearrangements. Host
genomes have therefore evolved sophisticated silencing pathways to identify TEs and suppress their
replication activity. However, active TEs remain present in the genomes of almost all eukaryotes. One
explanation for their persistence over evolutionary time is that, like viruses, TEs evolve rapidly to escape host
silencing, which in turn selects for an adaptive response from the host, thus locking TEs and their hosts into an
evolutionary arms race. Unlike viruses, whose immune evasion strategies have been well-studied, the
mechanisms by which TEs are able to escape host silencing are relatively unknown. The overall goal of our
research program is to understand strategies used by TEs to escape host silencing and how such strategies
affect host phenotypes and/or disease states.
Our research is currently focused on three such strategies: (1) Permissive niches for TE mobilization: one way
TEs can escape host silencing is by preferentially mobilizing in vulnerable cell types and/or being transcribed
highly enough to overwhelm host defenses. Our goal for this research direction is to identify novel permissive
niches and understand the mechanisms TEs use to gain expression in these cell types. (2) Host gene capture
by TEs: Drosophila telomeres are composed of specialized retrotransposons that replicate onto the
chromosome ends. These elements likely evolve in conflict with their host despite serving an essential cellular
function. We have identified telomeric retrotransposons in over 100 species of Drosophila and found that these
elements have repeatedly captured fragments of host TE silencing genes. Our goal for this research direction
is to understand this gene capture phenomenon and how it is used by TEs to evade host silencing. (3) TE
derepression in species hybrids: hybrid dysgenesis occurs in F1 progeny when a TE is present in the paternal
genome but missing from the maternal genome. Small RNAs that target such a TE are therefore unable to be
supplied to the embryo by the mother and the TE becomes hyperactivated in the progeny, usually resulting in
DNA damage, sterility, and gonadal atrophy. We have discovered a novel exception to this phenomenon where
a gypsy family TE is massively upregulated in F1 progeny without an obvious effect on fertility. This situation
provides a unique opportunity for studying post-transcriptional regulation of TE activity."
10765157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Gene regulatory networks play a crucial role in determining how genes are expressed in response to cellular
or environmental signals. Changes to these networks are important in evolution and disease, but the
mechanisms responsible for rewiring these networks are not well understood. Transposable elements (TEs) are
genomic parasites that replicate within host DNA and have long been proposed to drive the evolution of gene
regulatory networks, yet their actual impact on health and disease remains controversial and poorly understood.
My research group uses bioinformatic and experimental approaches to uncover important roles for TEs as
components of both beneficial and pathological gene regulatory networks. Over the next five years, we will
pursue research in 3 major areas that will investigate how TEs impact biological function across species,
organismal, and cellular levels. In one area, we will investigate how TEs shape species-specific immunity by
diversifying host transcriptomes. Building on our work establishing the impact of TEs on immune epigenomes,
we are expanding our focus to immune transcriptomes. We will use long-read RNA-seq to characterize TE-
derived isoforms in multiple species, and experimentally follow-up candidates with potentially significant
functions. In a second area, we will study the contribution of TEs to interindividual regulatory variation. We will
leverage newly developed genome graph assemblies, which enable accurate read mapping to complex structural
variants including TE-derived variants. Using a TE-focused genome graph assembly, we will re-analyze
population-scale epigenome studies to identify and characterize TE-derived variants with evidence of regulatory
activity. In a third area, we will elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying TE dysregulation in disease. TEs
undergo aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic reactivation in many diseases, and this is increasingly
recognized to contribute to pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms. However, the upstream causes of
disease-specific TE reactivation are poorly understood. To investigate why certain TEs become reactivated in
disease, we will integrate single-cell multi-omics, functional screens, and targeted experimental studies to define
the key steps involved in TE reactivation in cancer cells. Our work will integrate several cutting-edge technologies
including single-cell epigenomics, long-read functional genomics, pan-genome graph assemblies, and single-
cell CRISPR screening. Ultimately, our studies are positioned to demonstrate the profound impact of TEs on the
evolution of species-specific immune responses and the development of diseases."
10767310,"PROJECT SUMMARY. This research seeks to understand spatial phosphoinositide signaling (PI) mechanisms
in the cytosol and nucleus. These pathways have broad implications for cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders,
diabetes, and several congenital diseases. In the cytosol, agonists, such as EGF (and many others), activate
signaling pathways that control most cellular functions. In the nucleus, these pathways are separate from known
membrane compartments but control stress responses that impact DNA repair, cell survival, and other events.
Agonists activated PI3K signaling occurs through the IQGAP1 scaffold that assembles multiple pathways
including the PI 3-kinase and Erk pathways. Yet, how the IQGAPs assemble specific signaling pathways is not
understood. We will focus on the assembly of the full PI 3-kinase pathway on IQGAPs. This includes the
assembly of the PI 4-kinase (PI4KIII), type I PIP 5-kinase (PIPKI), PI3K, Ras, PDK1 and Akt into the
scaffold. Remarkably, we show that IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 also assemble the PI 3-kinase pathway components
but with different outcomes. IQGAP2 is tumor suppressor in cancer cells whereas IQGAP1 and IQGAP3 promote
PI3K signaling and cell proliferation. Here, we will explore how receptors stimulate the assembly of the IQGAPs
signaling pathways with an emphasis on the EGF receptor and IQGAP1-PI 3-kinase and Erk pathways. We will
emphasize spatial PI 3-kinase signaling at endosomal compartments at proximity to microtubules by linkage with
microtubule associated protein 4 (MAP4) that interacts with IQGAP1 and PI 3-kinase. The link between the
cytosolic and nuclear PI signaling is the PIPKI, which generates PIP2 in the cytosol and nucleus
Nuclear PI signaling remarkably is not associated with membrane compartments. We showed that a nuclear
poly(A) polymerase, Star-PAP (for speckle targeted PIPKI regulated-poly(A) polymerase), associates with
PIPKI and is activated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Star-PAP controls ~40% of genes and
is regulated by many signals. Recently, we have shown that PIPKI also binds to the tumor suppressor p53,
and that p53 is a PIP2 effector. The binding of PIP2 stimulates p53’s interactions with other nuclear factors that
control p53 function. Both Star-PAP and p53 are also regulated by inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK)
that generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) associated with p53, and nuclear PTEN that
dephosphorylates this PIP3. We have identified Star-PAP and p53 as two key effectors of nuclear
phosphoinositide signaling during stress signaling. This proposal will focus on the mechanism and impact of this
stress pathway on Star-PAP functions. Remarkably the PIPn is so tightly associated with Star-PAP and p53 that
it is stable to SDS-PAGE suggesting a covalent linkage and we will explore how PIP2 is linked to Star-PAP and
p53. Is this covalent or a very tight interaction that is resistant to denaturation? Our findings indicate new avenues
for potential therapeutic control of both the cytosolic and nuclear PI pathways as these pathways have
fundamental implications in many disease processes but with an emphasis on cancer."

We propose to study the relation between prenatal and early postnatal exposure to metals—as well as metal
exposures in adulthood—and cognitive function in older age, and the extent to which early life metal exposures
modify the effects of adult exposures. We will also explore whether those exposures and cognitive outcomes are
associated with changes in blood-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) micro RNA expression (miRNA), which could
represent epigenetic mechanisms underlying associations. We will conduct a cohort study among a subset of
participants in the original St. Louis Baby Tooth (SLBT) study who donated their baby teeth in the 1950s and
1960s. Based on our pilot work, we anticipate easily being able to enroll 1,000 former SLBT participants (500
men and 500 women) from whom we will collect blood and toenail samples, and all of whom will have responded
to questionnaires and undergone cognitive testing. Prenatal and early postnatal exposure of the 1,000 to several
metals will be assessed by measuring metals in baby tooth enamel (using laser-ablation inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry). Adult metal exposures will be assessed by analyzing a series of toenail clippings
collected roughly once a year. EVs will be isolated from the blood samples and analyzed for EV miRNA
expression levels. The SLBT provides a unique setting that will allow us to have individual-level biomarkers of
early life metal exposures in older adults on whom we can conduct cognitive function testing. This study setting
allows us to have an unprecedented ability to examine whether early life exposures are related to late life
cognitive health—a hypothesis suggested from animal research, but extremely hard to test in humans without
the biomarker of such early exposure that the already collected baby teeth in the SLBT can provide."
10771195,"CORE SUMMARY – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
The mission of the Oregon State University Superfund Research Program (SRP) is to identify polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the environment, characterize their toxicity, and specify the environmental
concentration below which they pose no threat to human health. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will
help the Center achieve this goal by responding to the concerns of communities impacted by hazardous
substances and identifying effective public health intervention and prevention strategies that reduce the
amount and toxicity of PAHs and other harmful substances. Specifically, we will partner with the Swinomish
Indian Tribal Community, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Pine Meadow Campground, and citizens who live adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund Site.
By leveraging resources of the SRP and our partners, the CEC will 1) identify and prioritize Tribal
environmental research questions and concerns, 2) identify and evaluate strategies that promote public health
and reduce the amount and toxicity of PAHs and other hazardous substances in food and the environment, 3)
evaluate how personalized chemical exposure data collected by a novel silicone wristband affects individual and
community-level awareness of pollution prevention strategies. By engaging participating in community-based
participatory research practices, the CEC will also foster trust, shared knowledge, scientific capacity, and
cultural competency among our partners and the SRP. Collectively, these efforts will advance knowledge of how
individuals in diverse communities can promote public health by preventing exposure to hazardous substances
found in their homes, their community, and/or their environment."
10771197,"CORE SUMMARY - RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING COORDINATION
CORE (RETCC)
The Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) of the OSU SRP will integrate with all
other components of the Center to provide trainees with the intensive multidisciplinary training and
professional development necessary to support the research, research translation, and community engagement
goals of the Center. We will achieve these objectives in three Specific Aims: 1) Recruit a diverse cohort
of trainees to the OSU Superfund Program; 2) Prepare a skilled workforce with the core
competencies and multidisciplinary experience necessary to solve the complex issues
associated with PAH mixtures; and 3) Monitor, evaluate and report on individual trainee
performance and the overall success of the program. The centerpiece of our training program is the
implementation of Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for pre- and postdoctoral trainees. IDPs provide the
framework for an on-going evaluation that identifies professional development and experiential training needs
in the context of required core competencies and personalized short- and long-term education and career goals.
RETCC leadership, together with the Research Project and Core leaders, will help trainees to develop their
IDPs, articulate goals, identify and engage training opportunities, and assess progress. Trainee IDPs will
emphasize cross-training in complimentary disciplines across the spectrum of superfund-related biomedical
and environmental science and engineering research. RETCC leadership will engage the Research Project and
Core PI's and a diverse cohort of stakeholders and collaborators to ensure the availability of a wide-ranging
selection of state-of-the-art training activities including transdisciplinary coursework, seminars, workshops,
journal clubs, and experiential training and professional development modules. The RETCC will promote
interdisciplinary training and professional development by supporting new externships and collaborative pilot
projects. Individual IDPs will require trainees to participate in activities initiated by the CEC, RTC and DMAC,
to engage in leadership training and opportunities, and to deliver presentations at local, regional and national
conferences. RETCC leadership will coordinate, track (using NIH CareerTrac), and evaluate trainee
performance and the overall success of the program. We will communicate trainee and Core activities and
achievements with the Center and the SRP. The impacts of our training program will manifest in the
achievement of current Center goals and in the on-going and future contributions of a cohort of environmental
health scientists who solve complex, real-world environmental problems, especially those associated with
Superfund sites."
10771201,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TEEGUARDEN PROJECT
Lack of understanding the molecular basis for susceptibility across toxicity test systems is a long-standing
barrier to improved risk assessment, improved cleanup decisions for SRP sites, and successful health
mitigations. Our objective is to develop transformative, activity-based proteomic probes and multi-modal
chemical microscopy to measure the metabolic and distributional processes that contribute to differential
susceptibility to PAH exposure. We hypothesize that measurable but commonly ignored differences in tissue
distribution and metabolic capacity to activate and/or detoxify PAHs contributes to differential susceptibility.
To test our hypothesis, we will complete three aims: 1. Identify the complete set of active P450, glutathione-S-
transferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes that metabolize PAHs & PAH metabolites. We will
incubate activity-based probes in tissue samples to enrich and identify active enzymes using our proteomics
platform. 2. Develop a single assay to determine both PAH metabolic rates and metabolic susceptibility by
relating PAH metabolic rates to global measures of enzyme activity. We will incubate activity-based probes in
tissues while conducting standard PAH metabolism assays to determine substrate specificity and metabolic
constants for active enzymes. 3. Determine how exposure susceptibility across test systems and humans
depends upon PAH physicochemical properties, tissue composition, and body composition. We will measure
tissue composition across our systems and measure and predict the disposition of PAHs across these systems,
and humans. The products of our research directly enhance the relevance and impact of each project and core
for stakeholders. Our innovations (ABPP and multi-modal chemical microscopy) will open new scientific
horizons in the understanding of two key molecular determinants of differential susceptibility. The work will
satisfy explicit expectations for SRP by a) demonstrating “that the hazardous substance, its dose, exposure
pathway and model organisms are considered within the context of timing, prevalence, and detection of
exposure” and by b) assuring that the “work is contextualized in terms of its relevance to human exposure.”
Our research results will directly inform and improve human health assessment for PAHs at Superfund sites."
10771203,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TANGUAY PROJECT
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are near ubiquitous contaminants at Superfund sites. Approximately
16% of the U.S. population, including ~17% of all children in the U.S. under the age of 5, live within 3 miles of a
Superfund site. The physical proximity of so many people to PAH contamination challenges regulatory
agencies to provide accurate risk assessments in order to protect public health. Human exposure to PAHs is
complex; exposures always occur as complex mixtures rather than as individual parent PAHs. The potency
for individual parent PAHs to produce adverse developmental outcomes is fairly well understood, but the
additive antagonistic or synergistic effects of PAHs in mixtures is largely unknown. An added level of
uncertainty is that PAHs are environmentally transformed, and the mobility and toxicity of these transformed
PAHs can be significantly greater than the parent forms. Developmental exposure to PAHs may carry the
greatest risk. Recent epidemiological data indicate strong associations between early life stage PAH exposures
and the increased occurrence of birth defects and increases in significant neurobehavioral deficits and heart
disease. Risk assessors desperately need of relevant in vivo data to develop comprehensive models for
predictive toxicity. By linking biological responses to PAH structures, uptake, and diagnostic gene expression
pathways, the Tanguay Project will establish zebrafish as a biosensor that can provide rapid feedback to SRP
stakeholders responsible for risk assessment and remediation. This approach interrogates all aspects of
development and the molecular pathways that underlie it, in one integrated experiment. We have developed an
effective framework for conveying this high-impact work to stakeholders and for collaborating with
populations to reduce their risk. Our overarching hypothesis is that we can learn to predict the toxicity of
PAH mixtures based on the structural classes, bioactivity profiles and pathway targets of their PAH
components. We will test this hypothesis in four Specific Aims: 1) Determine how the developmental impacts of
PAH exposure depend on the composition of PAH mixtures, the chemical structures of environmentally
transformed PAHs, and the presence of AHR signaling; 2) Measure the uptake and metabolism of biologically
active PAHs in zebrafish; 3) Develop diagnostic gene expression pathways for classes of PAHs, determine how
those pathways vary as a function of dose and associate those pathways with specific adverse effects; 4)
Determine adult and transgenerational consequences of transient developmental exposures to individual PAHs
and mixtures."
10762449,"Abstract
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), like most neurons, heavily rely on functions fulfilled by 
mitochondria. However, for unclear reasons the sensitivity of RGCs to mitochondrial dysfunction is 
higher than in others neuronal types. As a result, many blinding diseases that affect 
RGCs are accompanied by mitochondrial impairment. These diseases have very different etiologies 
but likely share a common pathophysiology that involves some aspect of mitochondrial 
biology. Nevertheless, we have little knowledge of the processes that regulate RGC 
mitochondria in vivo which has impeded the development of mitochondria-directed treatments to 
promote RGC repair. It is important therefore to understand how RGCs regulate mitochondrial 
function and dynamics in vivo as a step in defining regulatory nodes amenable to 
pharmaceutical intervention. RGC axons appear to be a prime target for these interventions as they 
are especially sensitive to degenerative stress. In these axons that extend to a considerable 
distance, it is crucial that mitochondria are appropriately distributed to serve the needs of the 
periphery. We recently highlighted the importance of this distribution for RGC repair. 
We demonstrated that increasing mitochondrial transport protects RGCs from degeneration and promote 
axonal regeneration (Cartoni et al. 2016). This study uncovered a key regulator of 
mitochondrial transport; a mammalian specific mitochondrial protein called Armadillo 
Repeat-Containing X Linked Protein 1 (Armcx1). We showed that it regulates axonal 
mitochondrial transport and that it is both necessary and sufficient for RGC survival 
and axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury. These findings suggest that Armcx1 
controls the mitochondrial distribution of a mitochondria based RGC repair program. Our long-term 
 research goal is to elucidate and manipulate the elements of this newly identified 
repair program to treat vision disorders. Despite the importance of Armcx1 in RGC repair after 
traumatic injury, little is known about the physiological functions of Armcx1 in healthy and 
diseased RGCs. Our overall objective is to evaluate how Armcx1 impacts RGC degeneration and repair 
as well as to decipher how this protein regulates mitochondrial dynamics and function. 
Based on our preliminary results, our central hypothesis is that Armcx1 regulates 
mitochondrial transport in demanding conditions such as diseases and/or axonal outgrowth. 
Specifically, we hypothesize that Armcx1 is a ubiquitous player in neuroprotection (Aim 1) and that 
it is a critical component of the normal RGC axonal outgrowth program (Aim 2). Finally, in an 
effort to understand the mechanism by which mitochondria promote RGC repair, we will analyze the 
axonal and somatic mitoproteome and identify direct and indirect Armcx1-binding partners in vivo 
(Aim 3)."
10763011,"Summary
The durability of diverse forms of T cell memory is critical for effective immunity against various pathogens, and
can be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy. Yet the signals that maintain T cell memory, and preserves the
identity of distinct memory subsets, are incompletely understood. In particular, while there is considerable data
suggesting that the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 are important for preservation of memory CD8+ T cells, there are
discrepancies in the literature that suggest this does not apply to all subpopulations of memory cells, or to all
infectious systems. We believe some of these discrepancies arise from experimental procedures that do not
accurately evaluate established memory T cell homeostasis (but which are conditioned by effects on memory
generation). To test this, in Aim 1, we will use temporally inducible gene knockout strategies to eliminate
sensitivity of T cells to IL-7 and/or IL-15, after the memory populations have been generated. We will examine
these models in both steady-state T cell homeostasis and in the response to “bystander” infections. In Aim 2,
we investigate the stability of two major classes of memory T cells – recirculating memory cells (“TMM”) and
tissue-resident (“TRM”) cells. Each has different functional roles and distinct trafficking patterns. Based on
published and preliminary studies, we will explore the role of the transcription factor KLF2 in controlling the
“identity” of TMM vs TRM (and whether changes in KLF2 expression – by genetic manipulation or in response to
statin drugs - will cause interconversion of TRM and TMM). We also investigate novel findings which indicate that
expression of the egress factor S1PR1 (which is a gene regulated by KLF2) is critical for recirculation of TMM
produced following some infections but not others, with consequences for therapeutic strategies to restain
pathogenic T cell responses by targeting S1PR1. Again, these models will harness inducible gene
knockout/expression models, as well as pharmacological treatments. Together, these studies represent a
novel and highly significant investigation into the basis for durability in the diverse subpopulations of memory
CD8+ T cells, with implications for how this can be manipulated for therapeutic goals."
10762957,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infection is the leading cause of mortality during the neonatal period. Early onset sepsis (EOS), which occurs
within the first 3-5 days after birth, has a mortality rate of approximately 25%. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of
the leading causes of EOS in both term and preterm infants. Prompt initiation of antibiotics is crucial to survival
in EOS, but is challenging because EOS presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms without reliable
biomarkers to aid in diagnosis. Empiric antibiotic therapy for all critically ill neonates is problematic because
unnecessary antibiotic exposure is associated with numerous short and long-term morbidities, including
necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis beyond the first five days of life and persistent wheezing and asthma during
childhood. This highlights the need to identify additional therapies to treat EOS. Historically, neonatal
susceptibility to infection has been attributed to developmental “immaturity” of the immune system. However,
more recent work suggests that neonatal innate immune cells can mount robust and effective immune
responses in many contexts. This points to the need for more research into immune cell independent defects
that may contribute to neonatal infection susceptibility. Iron is a trace nutrient required for the survival of all
organisms and is known to play a critical role during infection. Preliminary data in this proposal demonstrates
that 1) neonatal mice infected with E. coli rapidly die from the infection while adults readily clear the disease; 2)
neonatal mice mount a rapid and robust anti-microbial response to the infection that is equivalent to the
response in adult mice; 3) neonatal mice have increased intraperitoneal total iron that allows for rapid
unchecked growth of the E. coli; and 4) targeting this excess intraperitoneal iron improves neonatal survival
during E. coli infection. While iron metabolism in adults has been well-described, little is known about iron
metabolism during the neonatal period. It is likely that neonates have unique iron metabolism without the full
range of iron withholding strategies necessary to prevent infections. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that neonatal mice have increased iron available for bacterial consumption due to a unique
mechanism of iron acquisition both during gestation and while breastfeeding as well as altered iron
withholding capabilities. The overall goal of this proposal is to target this iron-rich niche to improve
survival in neonatal sepsis. This hypothesis will be investigated via the following specific aims: 1) Determine
the proportion of increased neonatal available iron that accumulates during gestation versus the proportion that
accumulates during breastfeeding; 2) Explore the impact of decreasing intestinal iron absorption and
increasing serum transferrin during the neonatal period on neonatal iron status and outcomes in neonatal E.

10762961,"The surface of cerebral blood vessels is covered nearly entirely by astrocyte processes called endfeet. Astrocytic
endfeet are perfectly positioned to interact with the endothelial vessel walls, and, where present, the surrounding
smooth muscles or pericytes. Through the release of vasoactive molecules such as PGE2, astrocytes regulate local
blood flow (functional hyperemia) and through the release of angiogenic signals induce tight junction proteins that
form the blood brain barrier (BBB). Consequently, any condition that compromises the structure or function of the
endfoot can cause impaired blood flow or impairments of the BBB. In a previous study using a model of familial
Alzheimer disease (AD; hAPPJ202), we1 showed vascular amyloid deposits aggregating between the astrocytic
endfeet and the vessel wall and such amyloid laden vessels showed an impaired ability to regulate vascular tone
and blood flow upon stimulation. Preliminary data suggests that where amyloid deposits are present on vessels
and endfeet displaced, focal breaches in the BBB occur. However, the causative role of vascular amyloid versus
structural and functional changes of astrocytic endfeet in this context are not known. Indeed, while reduced blood
flow and weakening of the BBB have been demonstrated with aging, the specific role of astrocytes in vessel health
over the lifespan are largely unknown. We hypothesize that normal aging is associated with progressive dysfunction
of astrocytic endfeet causing impairment in functional hyperemia and gradual weakening of the BBB. These agerelated
impairments are accelerated in the AD brain as a function of amyloid being functionally “toxic” to
astrocytes and/or pericytes. Here we propose to use two genetic mouse model of familial AD (hAPPJ202, APP233)
with robust vascular amyloidosis1,4 and progressive gliosis1, and age matched control animals to study the specific
role of astrocytes and pericytes to maintain vessel health and function during normal and pathological aging.
No prior studies have examined specific functional impairments of astrocyte endfeet in normal aging compared to
AD, and a possible specific gliotoxic effect of amyloid; two conceptually innovative ideas. State of the art chronic in
vivo multi-photon imaging will be applied to well established transgenic mouse models of AD with vascular
amyloidosis. Combined with novel cell-type specific genomics and proteomics, this proposal will shed light on
astrocyte specific changes in gene and protein expression over the time course of AD (and normal aging) with specific
analysis of gender differences."
10762962,"ABSTRACT: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-associated disease characterized by progressive
accumulation of scar tissue in the lungs. High morbidity rates in patients with IPF mandate more effective
treatments. A new paradigm implicates accumulation of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) that are compromised
by loss of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a master regulator of
proteostasis, in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms and metabolic
landscapes characteristic of age-related PF have not been identified. Our goal in this project is to use alveolar
epithelial type II (AT2) cell-specific Grp78-KO mice, modeling the age-specific GRP78 reductions seen in AECs,
to establish how GRP78-loss impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and biosynthesis, leading to development of
an aging phenotype in AT2 cells and subsequent lung fibrosis. Perturbed proteostasis and activation of ER
stress response signaling known as the unfolded protein response (UPRER) have been suggested as one
possible mechanism underlying observed AEC abnormalities. We found that GRP78 is downregulated
accompanied by activation of ER stress/UPRER in AT2 cells from IPF patients and aged mice/human
individuals. We further show that GRP78 undergoes reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced carbonylation
(the most common form of oxidative stress-induced damage to proteins) in AT2 cells from IPF patients and
aged mice. In our model, AT2 cell-specific Grp78-KO mice develop aging-associated phenotypes including
disrupted proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mTOR signaling and metabolism, apoptosis and
senescence in AT2 cells with subsequent lung fibrosis. In this study, we highlight an emerging theme that
GRP78 loss-disrupted proteostasis leads to gradual decline of mitochondrial function and metabolic fitness,
which in turn is tightly linked with phenotypic changes of AECs (apoptosis and senescence) with the endpoint
of lung fibrosis. The use of Grp78-KO mice to model GRP78 loss in AECs allows us to rigorously examine how
impaired proteostasis promotes development of an aging phenotype in AT2 cells. Guided by our published and
unpublished results, we hypothesize that age-related AEC-specific downregulation of GRP78 induces
unresolved ER stress/UPRER, which in turn dysregulates metabolism and overactivates mTOR leading
to AEC dysfunction and subsequent lung fibrosis in IPF. We propose the following specific aims to
address this hypothesis: AIM 1: To identify mechanisms whereby disturbed GRP78-dependent mitochondrial
function and metabolism in AEC promote the development of PF. Aim 2: To characterize the role and
mechanisms of GRP78 reduction in mediating AEC aging phenotype and PF. Aim 3: To determine the
therapeutic potential of targeting GRP78 loss-mediated pathways in age-associated PF in vivo and in vitro. The
proposed studies will provide rationale for how therapeutics that target metabolism might achieve specificity for
pro-fibrotic cells as anti-IPF agents."

The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Caroline Presley, MD, MPH the essential mentorship, career
development, and research experience necessary to become an independent investigator whose patient-
oriented research will contribute to improving emotional distress, self-management, and outcomes in vulnerable
people with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes distress — the emotional burden of living with and managing diabetes on
a daily basis — affects 36% of people with type 2 diabetes and is closely linked with poor adherence to diabetes
self-management behaviors, as well as suboptimal glycemic control, the presence of cardiovascular disease risk
factors, and diabetes complications. Low-income individuals are disproportionately affected by both diabetes
and diabetes distress. Currently, interventions are lacking to simultaneously help adults with type 2 diabetes to
improve their diabetes self-management and glycemic control, as well as to reduce diabetes distress. In this
four-year K23 project, Dr. Presley plans to study Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education — an intervention
specifically adapted for adults with type 2 diabetes and elevated diabetes distress that targets stress reduction
and improvement of diabetes self-management behaviors and outcomes. In safety-net healthcare clinics, she
will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing this intervention to standard Diabetes Self-
Management Education (DSME) in low-income adults with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes and
moderate-severe diabetes distress to assess feasibility and acceptability. Additionally, Dr. Presley will use mixed
methods to evaluate key contextual factors related to intervention delivery and implementation obtaining input
from provider and patient stakeholders. Assessing context is critical in designing for implementation and
sustainability. These results will inform a future fully-powered efficacy study of the intervention in safety-net
healthcare systems. We hypothesize that Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education will be acceptable and feasible
— tested through these specific aims. Aim 1: To conduct a pilot RCT of Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education
versus standard DSME to determine feasibility and acceptability among adults with suboptimally controlled type
2 diabetes and moderate-severe diabetes distress. Aim 2: To characterize the contextual factors relevant to
delivery and implementation of Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education using PRISM. Along with this mentored
research experience, the career development plan has been created for Dr. Presley to gain skills and experience
in 1) behavioral interventions and trials, 2) clinical application of mindfulness-based interventions, 3) mixed
methods research and implementation science through expert mentorship, advanced trainings, coursework, and
conferences, as well as opportunities for continued professional development. Upon completion of the project,
Dr. Presley will be poised to conduct a fully-powered efficacy study of the Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education
intervention supported by an R-series grant."

Helminths, allergens, and certain protists all stimulate a type 2 immune response and contribute significantly to
the global disease burden. Currently, more than 1 billion individuals worldwide are infected with helminths, and
the rising incidence of allergic disease represents an emerging epidemic. The sensing and signaling events
that initiate type 2 immunity remain poorly understood, but in the small intestine they require epithelial tuft cells.
Tuft cells regulate a tuft-ILC2 circuit in which tuft cell-derived IL-25 activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2s) in the underlying tissue. ILC2s secrete the canonical type 2 cytokines IL-5, -9, and -13, which
collectively drive hallmarks of type 2 immunity, such as eosinophilia and tissue remodeling. IL-13 also
promotes a feed-forward response by inducing tuft and goblet cell hyperplasia. The immune function of tuft
cells requires a chemosensory pathway and recent studies identified the microbial metabolite succinate as an
intestinal tuft cell ligand that is sufficient to activate the tuft-ILC2 circuit. Tuft cells therefore act as IL-25-
secreting immune sentinels, but several lines of evidence support the central hypothesis of this proposal that
additional tuft cell effector functions must exist: (1) Tuft cells express IL-25 constitutively, but the feed-forward
tuft-ILC2 circuit is only activated in the presence of helminths or protists, suggesting additional activating
signals; (2) the initiation of tuft cell hyperplasia after immune sensing has occurred suggests tuft cells
contribute to the effector stages of type 2 immunity; and (3) helminth clearance is more delayed in tuft cell-
deficient mice than in mice that lack only IL-25. The goal of this proposal is therefore to discover and
characterize novel tuft cell effector functions in the small intestine. Using a combination of innovative in vitro
assays and in vivo helminth infection of genetically modified mouse strains, we propose to test the regulation
and function of tuft cell-derived IL-25, leukotriene C4, and acetylcholine. These studies should identify novel
targets for therapeutic intervention in both helminth infection and allergic disease."

 This study will assess the psychosocial and behavioral impacts of receiving a risk assessment for late-
onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) incorporating APOE genotypes among Latinos in northern Manhattan. We
will conduct a longitudinal, community-based study with a mixed methods design and diverse, nuanced, and
sensitive assessments of impact. Participants will be randomized to learn about their lifetime risk of LOAD
based either on (a) ethnicity and family history alone (genotype nondisclosure group), or (b) the same factors
plus APOE genotype (genotype disclosure group). Impacts will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 9 months, and 18
months after risk assessment.
 In the quantitative study component, we will assess psychosocial outcomes, memory test performance,
and health-related behaviors. The primary endpoints are a significant difference between the genotype
disclosure and nondisclosure groups' scores on: (1) the Impact of Genetic Testing in AD scale, (2) the Impact
of Events Scale, (3) the Metamemory in Adulthood Questionnaire, and (4) the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by
Telephone. The secondary endpoints are significant differences in symptoms of depression or anxiety, health-
related behavior changes, perceived threat of AD, and recall and understanding of risk information. We will
also investigate factors that underlie variability in response and explore the patterns of longitudinal response to
the receipt of genetic information.
 In the qualitative study component, we will use a stress and coping theoretical framework to investigate the
lived experience of receiving personal AD risk information. This will include examination, at each time point, of
the ways in which participants understand and appraise AD risk information, how this is influenced by their lay
belief systems about genetics and AD illness representations, and what coping strategies they enact to
contend with their risk, its perceived implications, and the adaptive challenges it may pose. We will also assess
how coping strategies change over time and the contextual factors and conditions associated with those
changes, including Latino cultural values and norms; and how different coping strategies may enhance or
impede adjustment to AD risk information.
 The results will help identify persons at high risk for adverse consequences of APOE testing and inform
interventions to assist them to cope effectively. The information will be important for tailoring genetic education
or counseling interventions to Latinos."

Muco-obstructive airway diseases (MADs) are chronic, life-threatening conditions that cause more than 3 million
annual deaths worldwide. MADs are characterized by excess mucus accumulation in the airways, inflammation,
chronic infection, and progressive respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the primary bacterial
pathogen associated with MADs infections. Pa colonization leads to declining lung function, reduced quality of
life, and decreased life expectancy in people with MADs. Diabetes is a frequent comorbidity affecting 18-50% of
individuals with underlying MADs. Diabetes is associated with worse MADs clinical outcomes and increased
susceptibility to severe pulmonary infections. In addition, diabetes is associated with increased antibiotic
treatment failure in individuals with MADs. Utilizing novel in vitro and in vivo model systems, we have observed
increased virulence potential and higher tolerance to antibiotic treatments in Pa under diabetic MADs-like
conditions. These observations raise several questions such as how the diabetic microenvironment in MADs
induces Pa virulence and how it leads to higher rates of antibiotic tolerance. We hypothesize that diabetic
hyperglycemia in the lung microenvironment enhances bacterial fitness and potentiates bacterial
virulence. We further hypothesize that hyperglycemia alters bacterial metabolism towards increased
tolerance to antibiotic therapies. We will address these questions in both in vitro systems that reflect the MADs
and diabetes lung environment and in a diabetic murine chronic infection model of MADs. This proposal will
address key research areas including the influence of diabetes comorbidities in Pa virulence and antibiotic
treatment failure in MADs."

This SBIR Phase II (R44) grant application will leverage publicly available healthcare service pricing data (i.e.
emerging big data resources) to improve health information dissemination and utilization by minority health and
disparity individuals, small businesses and communities. The long-term goal is to reduce health literacy
barriers around the cost of healthcare and to simplify access to this information through an assisted mobile
application and secure short message service (SMS) that helps minority and disparity populations get the care
they need at a price they can afford. This will ultimately improve healthcare access and outcomes while
reducing the burden of medical debt.
Healthcare consumers today have limited information about the cost of a service until after it is rendered,
despite there being significant variability in the price of the same service depending on location and provider.
This makes it incredibly difficult for patients to make cost-informed choices about where to get healthcare or
check the accuracy of medical bills, contributing to the $195bn of medical debt that Americans are burdened
with. Minority health and disparity populations are disproportionately impacted by this, with Black Americans,
Hispanic Americans and those below the federal poverty level (FPL) more likely to carry medical debt [1].
Soaring healthcare costs and the considerable impacts to minority health and disparity populations have
resulted in significant legislative changes to enable healthcare price transparency through mandating public
access to pricing data and shopping tools. The overall objective of this SBIR Phase II (R44) research
proposal is to create a legislatively compliant healthcare service cost estimator and billing management mobile
application, with bilingual and SMS capabilities to assist minority health and disparity populations in America
find affordable healthcare and pay accurate medical bills. The technical feasibility of this solution has been
validated in Phase I of the research, through preliminary development of a cost estimator and billing
management application focused on prices of hospital services only. The proposed Phase II research will build
on the preliminary findings and achieve the overall objective through four key aims: Aim 1: Assemble a
national pricing database of healthcare services prices published by health plans, using cluster computing to
enable high-volume data ingestion; Aim 2: Develop a multi-dimensional healthcare cost estimator for service
quote building and approvals across multiple parties for Good Faith Estimates; Aim 3: Integrate a
multi-language friendly content management system and HIPAA-compliant short message service (SMS) to
support a bilingual (English and Spanish) application and ayschronous communication capabilities; Aim 4:
Validate the usability of the advanced Cost Estimator and Billing Management Application (aCEBA) and its
effectiveness in improving access and affordability of healthcare for socioeconomically disadvantaged
populations."

Early life stage exposures to toxicants can result in islet malformations, which may predispose individuals to
diabetes. The glutathione redox microenvironment plays fundamental roles in embryonic development and cell
signaling, perturbation of which can result in functional or structural alterations that only become apparent with
subsequent stress or age. Surprisingly little is known about how embryos respond to oxidative stress, or the
impact of toxicant exposures on pancreatic β-cell development. This project takes a multi-level approach using
state-of-the-art techniques to elucidate the complex pathophysiological mechanisms by which exposures to
Per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that cause oxidative stress derail islet development, and the
consequences for β-cell function. We test the central hypothesis that deviations from the GSH redox

time- impair β-cell development and function. There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) to deepen
our understanding of the role of Nrf2 activation in embryonic β-cells and islet development; 2) ascertain the
impact of PFAS on insulin biosynthesis; and 3) identify β-cell fragility and bioindicators of later-life metabolic
impacts that can be translated to human health. We will use transgenic zebrafish, confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence, redox proteomics and insulin misfolding assays, and cultured β-cells to investigate
exposures to two common PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS), and a legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). This work
will have a sustained and powerful impact on the fields of developmental toxicology, redox biology, and the
developmental origins of health and disease and provides critical advances towards developing science-based
PFAS guidelines, targets for clinical interventions, and public health policies."

Loss of one or both parents can have devastating consequences for children, adolescents,
extended families, communities, and nations. Recently, improvements in HIV treatment and
prevention have led to dramatic declines in orphanhood. This appears to be the result of
combination HIV prevention (CHP), particularly expanded access to highly effective
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and declining HIV-related mortality among adults – adults who are
often parents. The declines in HIV-related orphanhood proffer substantial benefits to children
and youth, families, and their communities. Little is known about how declines in orphanhood
among youth may have impacted social and economic factors that influence HIV risk as
orphans move into the adolescent and young adult (AYA) years.
 The Rakai Orphans in Communities (ROC) Study will explore impact, measurement, and
policy issues at the intersection of orphanhood, HIV risk among AYA, adolescent social
transitions, and family and social context. Impacts include HIV risk and social and economic
consequences. Measurement of age at orphaning will be a critical component of this proposal.
In several studies, earlier age at orphaning appears to be related to more adverse outcomes.
Thus, key issues are estimating the impact of orphanhood on social and behavior risk for HIV
and how that impact may change based on the age at orphaning. An under-explored component
which we will examine is the economic benefits of CHP weighed against the costs. Using the
rich resources of the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), we will explore the relationship
between HIV treatment and prevention, orphanhood, and new HIV infection among AYA.
Documenting the impact of CHP on HIV-related orphanhood and the decline HIV risk will guide
future investments in HIV treatment and prevention programs and health and social policies for
children and youth."

Liver disease is a leading cause of mortality in persons with HIV (PWH), and PWH suffer a disproportionate
burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While the mechanisms underlying this disparity are not
well understood, intestinal dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of
NAFLD in HIV-negative persons. HIV infection has been shown to alter the intestinal microbiome, change the
plasma metabolome and impair intestinal barrier function; however, there are few data on the microbiome and
metabolome among PWH with NAFLD. My pilot preliminary data show that hepatic steatosis is associated with
differences in the intestinal bacterial community (reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria), bacteria-related
metabolites (including phosphatidylcholine), and markers of intestinal barrier dysfunction among PWH on long-
term ART. I hypothesize that intestinal dysbiosis in PWH promotes NAFLD through 1) impairment of intestinal
barrier function and 2) alteration of the plasma metabolome to promote hepatic lipid deposition. In Aim 1 I will
determine whether differences in plasma levels of NAFLD- and bacteria-related metabolites, including
phosphatidylcholine and trimethylamine N-oxide, are associated with hepatic steatosis in PWH. In Aim 2 I will
determine whether decreased abundance of butyrate-producing gut bacteria and markers of impaired intestinal
barrier function are associated with hepatic steatosis in PWH. In Aim 3 I will test the feasibility and limited
efficacy of a multi-strain probiotic and prebiotic fiber on NAFLD biomarkers in a prospective trial in PWH. Aims
1 and 2 will leverage existing data and specimens from 134 PWH in the NIH-supported HIV, Adipose Tissue
Immunology and Metabolism (HATIM) cohort, which includes metabolomic, microbiome, and imaging studies
from participants with a spectrum of metabolic fitness and in the absence of viral hepatitis or excessive alcohol
use. Secondary analyses will compare the findings from the HATIM cohort with both HIV-negative controls and
PWH with viral hepatitis and heavy alcohol use. The Aim 3 pilot trial will leverage the well-developed
infrastructure and large recruitment pool of the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research. Collectively, these Aims
address the call for research related to HIV-associated comorbidities, coinfections and complications described
in NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-related Research, and have the potential to inform new microbiome-
based diagnostics and treatments that will reduce the burden of NAFLD in PWH. My research and training plan
will be supported a multi-disciplinary team of scientists who have a strong record of mentoring young
investigators and the world-class training environment and resources available at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center. In addition to the benefits to the health of PWH, the proposed K23 studies and training plan will allow
me to further my expertise in patient-facing research and generate the data and publication track record
necessary to develop a self-sustaining research career in the field of HIV-related liver disease."

The HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) mediates virus entry into cells while protecting functional centers from
antibodies. As the only virus protein on the surface of virus particles, HIV-1 Env is a major target for vaccine
development. We initiated studies on HIV-1 Env by establishing single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy
Transfer (smFRET) to monitor the sampling of a single protomer in the context of a Env trimer on the surface of
a virus particle. smFRET data indicated that HIV-1 Env is conformationally dynamic and samples at least three
conformational states. Associating the observed FRET states with existing HIV-1 Env structural information
revealed a conformational state on the surface of viruses that cannot be explained by current high-resolution
structures. The controversy surrounding smFRET data prompted us to establish cryo-electron tomography
(cryoET) as an orthogonal structural method. The advantage of cryoET and smFRET is that both methods allow
for characterization of the structure and dynamics of Env on the surface of viruses. In addition, we identified
experimental conditions that arrest a high number of Env trimers at various stages of the entry process to allow
a structural characterization by cryoET and subsequent subtomogram averaging. We succeeded with a system
where we incubate native HIV-1 viruses with virus-like particles (VLP) carrying receptor CD4 and coreceptor

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects ~35M people in the US and ~250M world-wide, but there is no effective therapy. OA
is characterized by cartilage loss, synovial inflammation and subchondral bone remodeling, associated with the
accumulation of numerous catabolic mediators and inflammatory cells in the synovial space. How these factors
are cleared and if the “clearance” process contributes to the pathogenesis of OA is unknown. Using imaging
tools that we developed in past 10 years, we identified a Synovial Lymphatic System (SLS) in mouse joints, the
function of which is impaired in joints of mice with age-related OA. Thus, strategies to improve lymphatic
function may benefit OA patients. In this application, we hypothesize that 1) aged joints have impaired SLS
function and VEGFR3-mediated signaling, accompanied by reduced VEGF-C expression and elevated
VEGFR3 degradation; 2) RANKL promotes ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of VEGFR3 in LECs; and
3) the combination of VEGF-C and agents preventing VEGFR3 degradation improves the SLS and attenuates
the development of OA during aging. We will use an age-related OA mouse model to test our hypotheses. In
Aim 1, we will determine if the SLS becomes defective during aging and causes OA tissue damage, associated
with reduced VEGFR3-mediated signaling in lymphatic endothelial cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the
molecular mechanisms whereby VEGFR3 is degraded in aging joints and if a combination of VEGF-C and the
inhibition of VEGFR3 degradation prevent OA in aging mice. The results of our study will establish a role for
SLS dysfunction in the pathogenesis of OA, and augmentation of SLS functions could be a promising
therapeutic approach to prevent or delay age-associated joint damage. This will provide preclinical evidence
for agents targeting lymphatic vessels as a potential therapeutic strategy for OA in aging."
10765215,"Ubiquitination as a reversible post-translational modification is essential to a broad range of cellular
processes in humans. In addition to its function in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, ubiquitination is
crucial for many non-proteolytic cellular processes. These cellular processes are regulated by a diverse array of
polyubiquitin chains of different linkages and topologies, including recently discovered branched polyubiquitin
chains. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) modulate the ubiquitin chain linkage and structure and are considered promising
new targets for therapeutic intervention. The goals of our work are to investigate the recognition and cleavage
of atypical polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitinated proteins by DUBs; identify and characterize reader proteins of
branched ubiquitin chains and understand the roles of branched ubiquitin chains in mitophagy and receptor
endocytosis. These projects are interconnected and complementary to each other, building on our success in
chemical protein ubiquitination and DUB probe construction using semisynthetic approaches. The new chemical
biology tools developed, particularly novel activity-based DUB probes, will serve to unveil new biological targets
and functions in the ubiquitin system and provide new ways of identifying the reader and eraser proteins of
ubiquitin signals. The mechanistic and structural insights obtained will in turn propel drug discovery efforts
exploiting the ubiquitin system and lead to new opportunities and means for treating human diseases including
neurodegeneration and cancer."
10783066,"Understanding how non-coding DNA regulates gene expression is critical to addressing myriad problems in
biotechnology and human health. This endeavor, however, has proven a major challenge, in part, as the
genome appears to encode many highly convoluted regulatory networks. Particularly in vertebrates, regulatory
elements such as promoters or enhancers are highly diverse and contain of dozens of DNA motifs spaced by
intervening sequences. Traditional sequence analysis strategies that focus on conservation are ineffective to
single out the functional motifs as regulatory DNA evolves rapidly and often even relocates.
The transcription start site (TSS) is a landmark of gene regulation. Accurate TSS enables to define DNA motifs
functionally associated with transcription. TSSs further allow anchoring and comparing the regulatory regions
or orthologous genes across evolution, independent of direct sequence conservation. Although distantly
related organisms typically lack homologous regulatory DNA, it remains to be explored to what extent specific
sequence motifs are selectively conserved to drive expression gene. I therefore developed capped small RNA-
seq (csRNA-seq), which accurately maps the TSS of both stable (protein coding and non-coding RNAs) and
unstable transcripts (enhancer RNAs, divergent transcripts) to reveal active regulatory elements genome-wide.
csRNA-seq only requires total RNA as starting material, thus enabling TSSs profiling in virtually any eukaryotic
organism from which RNA can be extracted. Eukarya, from unicellular protists to humans, vary in organismic,
genetic and regulatory complexity. I hypothesize that this spectrum in diversity, combined with TSS mapping
(csRNA-seq), can be exploited to uncover the key DNA motifs and subsequently TF networks that regulate
gene expression across the Eukarya. Analogous to the work of an archeologist at prehistoric sites, mapping
TSSs along the tree of life ‘excavates’ ancestral, less convoluted states of gene regulation. These insights
should also be instrumental to better interpret the human genome. To explore this central hypothesis, I seek to
1) implement tools for the analysis and visualization of csRNA-seq and facilitate the comparative analysis of
annotated regulatory features across species, 2) identify the TF binding sites mediating transcription initiation
across Eukarya, 3) trace the evolution and usage of TF binding sites and their spatial organization in regulatory
elements of orthologous genes or sets of genes. In preparation, I have generated data for 42 Eukarya
spanning over 2 billion years of transcriptome evolution and joined an exceptional bioinformatics group, which
also provides a unique an opportunity for training critical for my successful transition to independence.
This proposal, if successful, will reveal the major DNA motifs mediating transcription and markedly expand our
mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation. Furthermore, it will provide a novel method to
capture nascent TSSs (csRNA-seq), a free software suite to facilitate analysis, a data portal for easy data
access and browsing, and unique dataset to the greater scientific community."
10783074,"Gastrointestinal (GI) motility is sexually dimorphic. In women, GI motility varies with hormonal changes
during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. However, there is a gap in the knowledge and understanding the
role of estrogen and the mechanism by which it regulates sex- and cycle-dependent changes in GI motility and
dysmotility. Unlike classical nuclear receptors ERα, ERβ, activation of membrane-bound G protein-coupled
estrogen receptor (GPER) by estrogen initiates rapid cellular events. We have obtained preliminary evidence to
show that GPER is expressed in smooth muscle and is coupled to AC/cAMP/PKA pathway to mediate muscle
relaxation in the stomach and the colon. Smooth muscle from GPER KO mice exhibited loss of relaxation in
response to GPER agonist providing evidence for a role of GPER in smooth muscle relaxation. GI transit was
delayed in female mice of high-estrogen proestrus and estrus phases compared to low-estrogen diestrus phase,
and male mice. These sex- and cycle-dependent changes in GI transit are associated with changes in the
expression and function of GPER. Based on these preliminary data, studies are proposed to test the hypothesis
that sex- and cycle-dependent changes in GI transit are due to changes in expression and function of GPER
coupled to activation of AC/cAMP/PKA pathway and smooth muscle relaxation (Specific Aim 1).
 GI motility disorders are also sexually dimorphic. There is greater prevalence of diabetes-associated
gastroparesis and constipation in women compared to men. The contribution of impaired smooth muscle function
and role of GPER in smooth muscle has not been fully explored in sexual dimorphism in GI dysmotility in
diabetes. Preliminary studies showed that expression of GPER was decreased in smooth muscle from diabetic
mice and the decrease is mediated via oxidative stress-induced changes in epigenetic regulation via a decrease
in trimethylation of H3 at lysine residue 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylation of H3 at lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) at
the promoter region of GPER gene. RNA-seq data combined with heatmap analysis showed an increase in the
expression of selective histone deacetylase (HDACs) in smooth muscle from diabetic mice. An increase in
oxidative stress was also obtained in smooth muscle from GPER KO mice suggesting the increase in oxidative
stress in diabetes could be due to a decrease in GPER expression. Based on the preliminary data, studies ae
proposed to test the hypothesis that an increase in oxidative stress in diabetes downregulates GPER expression
via decrease in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac of GPER promoter, and loss of GPER-mediated protection against
oxidative stress leads to decrease in cAMP/cGMP signaling, muscle relaxation and GI transit (Specific Aim 2).
 Knowledge gained from our study is intended to provide insights into the cellular mechanisms involved
in sex-and cycle-dependent changes in GI motility. The unknown underlying etiology of female sex-specific
prominence of diabetes-associated GI dysmotility underscores the clinical significance of the proposed studies."

 Protein-protein interactions, self-assembly, and membrane targeting and remodeling are intimately
associated with many critical cellular phenomena, including endocytosis, infection, immune response, organelle
formation, cell division, signaling, and movement. These processes are innately multiscale, as they span from
the molecular to nanoscopic to mesoscopic time and length scales. For instance, the molecular-level
interactions between collections of proteins and the lipid membrane can have a profound effect on the large
scale membrane morphology. Likewise, the atomistic details of actin and actin-binding protein interactions
propagate to much longer length and time scales involving protein assembly processes in the cellular
cytoskeleton. Therefore, the main scientific premise of this project is that it is critical to study, in a coupled
fashion across multiple scales, the propagation of local molecular interactions upward in scale to the collective
behavior at the cellular level. The research involves the continued development and application of novel
multiscale, coarse-grained computational methods that are ideally suited to investigate the collective
interactions of proteins with other proteins and with membranes, within the context of key cellular phenomena
 There are two main overarching aims of this research: (1) the continued development of new multiscale
simulation methods that can be utilized to study increasingly complex aspects of large scale protein-protein and
protein-mediated membrane processes, and (2) the elaboration of the mechanisms by which key proteins target
and remodel realistic biological membranes, and how proteins interact and self-assemble with one another in
the cytoskeleton and at the cytoskeleton-membrane interface. In collaboration with leading experimental
researchers, the applications of the multiscale simulations will include studies of realistic membrane models,
protein-mediated remodeling of membranes and actin filaments, the interaction of actin filaments with peripheral
membrane proteins to regulate membrane curvature, and the mechanism of highly ordered coat protein-induced
membrane remodeling. The overarching long term goal of this research is to continue to develop and apply a

the United States. There is no cure for this condition. Corneal tranplantation is the prevalent treatment. 
With the aging population, there is increasing scarcity of donor tissues. In addition, tranplant failures due 
to graft rejections occur in 10-25% of corneal transplantations. This proposal focuses on identifying 
previously understudied molecular signaling pathways in FECD. Successful completion of the specific

10783742,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anemia is an extraordinarily common condition that affects approximately 1 in 3 people around the globe.
Erythropoiesis is exquisitely sensitive to both endogenous and exogenous stress, which contributes to this
massive global disease burden. Genetic defects in ribosomes that lead to severe anemia are associated with
rare inherited bone marrow failure syndromes as well as more commonly acquired myelodysplastic syndrome.
The pathway from ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency to defective erythropoiesis in Diamond Blackfan anemia
(DBA) is complex and likely involves multiple factors (e.g. diminished GATA1 translation, heme toxicity and/or
nucleolar stress). Patients with DBA can undergo spontaneous remission such that chronic transfusions are
not required. This phenomenon is poorly understood using current patient registries and animal models.
Understanding normal pathways that lead to the resolution or improvement of anemia is critical in order to
advance therapies for DBA and other causes of anemia. The applicant is a pediatric hematologist/oncologist
who actively treats patients with all types of genetic and acquired anemias and her long term goal is to become
a physician-scientist with expertise in hematopoiesis. To achieve this goal, the candidate has proposed the
following training plan: 1) To develop expertise in isolation and analysis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells;
2) To further develop expertise employing mouse models and human hematopoietic stem cell culture to study
disease-specific mechanisms; 3) To develop an independently funded basic research laboratory; 4) To develop
into a successful physician-scientist focused on mentorship and collaboration. The candidate has assembled a
mentorship team with expertise in hematopoiesis and mouse models (Drs. Engel and Li). The environment at
the University of Michigan is highly conducive to the training of successful junior physician-scientists with
exceptional resources, educational and collaborative opportunities. The scientific proposal centers on the
hypothesis that DBA remission, even in these inbred mice, is based on a threshold effect on hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells that responds to both exogenous and endogenous modifiers. The rationale for this
hypothesis is based on observations in our unique DBA mouse model where all neonatal Rpl5 (ribosomal
protein gene) mutant mice are born with anemia, which contributes to early mortality in some mice while others
survive and maintain normal hemoglobin characteristics throughout their lifespan. Aim 1 will determine if there
is an intrinsic defect in stem/progenitor cells and/or the bone marrow microenvironment in mutant mice by
examining transplantation of hematopoietic cells from different developmental periods. Aim 2 will test whether
cellular stress alters the niche and/or hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell function. Aim 3 will examine whether
cell cycle dysregulation is responsible for defective hematopoiesis during developmentally vulnerable periods
or during cellular stress. Completion of training under the guidance of senior mentors will enable the applicant
to develop into an independent physician-scientist with greater expertise in hematopoiesis."
10783743,"Proposal Summary:
The increasing rates of obesity and associated metabolic syndrome pose a major public health concern.
Although behavioral (diet and/or exercise), surgical, and pharmacological modalities exist for weight loss, many
individuals are unable to maintain this weight loss due to behavioral and neuroendocrine adaptions in the brain
promoting weight re-gain. Therefore, pathways preventing compensatory adaptations to weight loss would
provide a wholly novel approach to the conundrum of obesity treatment. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide
(AgRP) neurons are activated by hunger and dieting and potently engage behavioral and neuroendocrine
neural circuits to drive behaviors promoting increased food intake and rebound weight gain. Here, we show
that the melanocortin 3 receptor is densely expressed in AgRP neurons, with 97% of AgRP neurons containing
MC3R. Furthermore, pharmacological manipulation of MC3R bi-directionally regulates feeding in an AgRP
neuron dependent manner, with agonism of MC3R stimulating feeding and antagonism of MC3R suppressing
feeding. Consistently, mice with impaired MC3R function do not re-feed normally following both fasting and
caloric restriction and fail to adequately activate neuroendocrine responses to weight loss. In this proposal, we
will evaluate the utility of MC3R specific antagonists as a therapeutic strategy for preventing compensatory
responses to weight loss. We will also determine the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) mediating the
anorexigenic effects of MC3R antagonism. The principle investigator in this training grant, Dr. Patrick
Sweeney, has extensive experience in behavioral neuroscience and mouse feeding behavior. In this training
grant, Dr. Sweeney will receive additional training in metabolic physiology, neuroendocrinology, obesity
biology, and pharmacology from the primary research mentor, Dr. Roger Cone. Furthermore, under the
guidance of an expert team of collaborators, Dr. Sweeney will receive hands on training in brain slice
electrophysiology and in vivo endomicroscopic brain imaging. Together, the mentorship and training in this
K99/R00 application will provide the necessary technical and conceptual background for Dr. Sweeney to
initiate an independent research program focusing on MC3R neural circuits as therapeutic targets for obesity
and eating disorders."
10783744,"Abstract
The regulation of glucose homeostasis is a complex process, which is disrupted in disease states such as type
2 diabetes. Insulin is the primary hormone that regulates glucose homeostasis. Insulin stimulates glucose
uptake in muscle and fat by mobilizing intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 glucose transporters, which fuse
and insert GLUT4 at the cell surface. Impairment of this process results in insulin resistance and contributes to
the development of diabetes. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of metabolic disease, it is necessary
to understand the molecular mechanisms that control GLUT4 trafficking, and to understand how this trafficking
is modulated by insulin and disrupted in insulin resistance. Previous work identified the TUG protein as a
major regulator of GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake in muscle and fat cells. The data support a model in
which TUG mediates the intracellular retention of GLUT4 in specific vesicles within unstimulated cells. Insulin
triggers TUG endoproteolytic cleavage to mobilize these vesicles to the cell surface. TUG cleavage
coordinates glucose uptake with other physiologic effects, resulting from the action of proteins that co-traffic
with GLUT4, as well as from action of the TUG C-terminal product to modulate gene expression. In insulin
resistant individuals, impairment of this mechanism may contribute to the metabolic syndrome and obesity.
Yet, it remains unknown how this mechanism is affected in insulin resistance, whether attenuated TUG
cleavage causes insulin resistance in muscle, or whether TUG cleavage participates in exercise-stimulated
glucose uptake. As well, the molecular mechanisms by which intact TUG retains GLUT4 in an insulin-
responsive pool of vesicles are not understood. To address these questions, two Aims will be undertaken.
Aim 1 will characterize insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis in mice with muscle-specific disruption of
TUG or of TUG endoproteolytic cleavage, and will study the potential role of this pathway in exercise-induced
glucose uptake. Aim 2 will study molecular mechanisms by which TUG traps GLUT4-containing vesicles in an
insulin-responsive pool, and by which this process may be altered in insulin-resistant states. We anticipate
that, together, these studies will result in an improved understanding of glucose metabolism and energy
expenditure, with implications for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome."

Excess fat accumulation and deposition of ectopic lipid in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the liver and skeletal
muscles contribute substantially to the high risk for cardiometabolic disease in persons with HIV (PWH) on
antiretroviral therapy (ART). While the potential for weight gain during the first year of ART is well-recognized,
the amount of weight is highly variable, and more importantly, it is the accumulation of excess body fat and
ectopic lipid that drives cardiometabolic comorbidities and complications. We hypothesize that during the first
year of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based therapy there is rapid onset of a state of positive energy
balance, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and impaired ability of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to store lipids
(driven in part by persistent T cell-mediated SAT inflammation), which leads to the deposition of excess lipids in
VAT, the liver and skeletal muscle further inhibiting the ability of these organs and tissues to function normally.
This multi-disciplinary study will be led by three established PIs with complementary expertise in the fields of HIV
clinical research, adipocyte biology and physiology, nutrition, human metabolism, and imaging. We will leverage
state-of-the-science procedures and technologies including comprehensive assessment of factors driving energy
balance, adipose tissue micro-liposuction, adipose tissue single cell transcriptomics, SAT gene expression, and
imaging of ectopic lipid depots during the first year of INSTI-based ART in 129 treatment-naïve PWH to meet
the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine precisely when and where excess fat accumulates, including
ectopic depots (hallmarks for insulin resistance and development of diabetes) during the first year of INSTI-
based ART (when viral suppression occurs), and whether the storage of excess fat in specific regions and depots
is driven by excess energy intake, reduced energy expenditure, and/or reduced fatty acid oxidation; Aim 2: To
determine the specific changes in the SAT architecture, cellular composition, and transcriptomic features that
contribute to body region and depot-specific ectopic fat accumulation; Aim 3: To determine the specific changes
that occur in the SAT immune environment and HIV reservoir that adversely modulate adipocyte cellular function
and lipid storage. Our longitudinal study in treatment-naïve PWH during the first year of INSTI-based ART will
be the first to identify mechanisms linking changes in energy balance, fatty acid oxidation, SAT architecture and
function, and the impact of the SAT immune environment on adipocyte plasticity and adipocyte regulatory and
lipid trafficking pathways involved in the accumulation of VAT and ectopic lipid in the liver and skeletal muscle.
The first year of ART provides a critical opportunity to prevent increased adiposity and excessive fat deposition
in the intra-abdominal, liver and skeletal muscle depots, and thus reduce the risk for cardiometabolic disease in
PWH. These data will identify targets for future clinical and pharmaceutical intervention studies to prevent or re-
direct body fat and ectopic lipid gain after ART initiation to prevent and/or reduce the growing burden of
cardiometabolic diseases in PWH."
10783751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Complete understanding of brain function requires reliable and comprehensive mapping of large-scale brain
networks with high spatiotemporal resolution and minimum invasiveness. Tools to achieve such mapping must
overcome a myriad of challenges that are not adequately or simultaneously addressed by any existing
technology. Hence the overall goal of this proposal is to develop a new diamond-based neural interface system
that consists of up to 256 recording sites in mm3-sized volumes for combined electrical and chemical
detection of neuronal activity in living nerve tissues. The proposed innovative tool will have the following
significant advantages over existing technologies. First, highly-conductive BDD electrodes will simultaneously
enhance the sensitivity, selectivity, and stability of neurological sensing. They will also have a greater potential
range of operation than current electrode materials. Second, by using undoped PCD as a hermetic,
biocompatible, and low-fouling encapsulation material, the new device will potentially have greater longevity and
long-term stability for chronic applications. Third, a compact, dual-mode headstage will better enable the
control of electrophysiology and fast-scan cyclic voltammetric (FSCV) measurements with high precision and a
strong signal-to-noise ratio, while minimizing crosstalk. Fourth, the novel micromachining technique will
permit wafer-level, mass production of diamond electrodes with various geometries, fine spatial resolution
(submicrometer to micrometer scale), and high yields (>90%). Adopted from well-established semiconductor
manufacturing techniques, the proposed fabrication approach is more reliable, consistent, scalable, and
labor/cost-efficient than the hand assembly approach that is widely used today for making carbon fiber electrodes.
Last but not least, 3D arrays of highly packed electrodes will significantly enhance the lateral and depth
coverage of the new electrochemical detection tools compared to current chemical sensing tools. The project
will be conducted by a multidisciplinary, collaborative team of researchers. The team will leverage their extensive
experience in developing diamond fiber electrodes and in refining material synthesis and device fabrication
techniques to push the spatial resolution of diamond electrodes from several tens of microns to submicrometer
(via electron-beam lithography) and to micrometer (via ultraviolet lithography) (Aim 1). In parallel with electrode
development, the team will engineer solutions to implement miniaturized head-mounted electrophysiology and
FSCV electronics, and integrate the headstage with diamond electrode arrays to achieve a complete system
(Aim 2). The functionality, biocompatibility, and stability of the integrated system will then be assessed ex vivo
and in vivo using complementary analysis techniques (Aim 3). The proposed work is significant because it will
yield a revolutionary neural interface tool that can be readily disseminated to other researchers for use in
neuroscience and clinical studies to reveal the mechanisms underlying many brain disorders and diseases."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) research typically analyzes relapse and recovery processes over short
time-frames, such as during and immediately following a treatment episode. The long-term trajectories of
recovery, the impact of relapse episodes, and their associated neurobehavioral markers and precipitants
comprise a vital gap in our scientific understanding of the recovery process. Our goals are to provide a
scientific understanding of recovery and relapse, as well as to identify novel targets for future relapse
prevention interventions. Specifically, changes in the mechanisms underlying AUD will be investigated using
the Competing Neurobehavioral Decision Systems (CNDS) framework, which posits that addiction and relapse
arise from a regulatory imbalance between the impulsive and executive decision systems. To pursue this goal,
participants with AUD will be recruited from the International Quit & Recovery Registry (IQRR), which was
established in 2011 and currently has about 8,775 registrants. The IQRR provides a unique online resource
that permits the scientific study of recovery processes and the highly efficient collection of data suitable for
long-term repeated measurement research. We will use an accelerated longitudinal design, which allows the
prospective characterization of psychosocial functioning, relapse, and CNDS functioning across 12 years of
AUD recovery by recruiting participants with a range of different recovery lengths, up to 10 years. Over three
years, participants will complete quarterly assessments, including measures of CNDS functioning. In Aim 1, we
will examine the psychosocial functioning over long-term AUD recovery and how it is impacted by CNDS
regulation. In Aim 2, we will examine relapse over long-term AUD recovery and how it is impacted by CNDS
regulation. In Aim 3 we will examine the dynamic interaction of CNDS processes impacting the recovery using
computational modeling. Together, the findings from this rigorous and innovative research project will improve
our understanding of the temporal dynamics and underlying mechanisms of recovery from AUD."

We will use state-of-the-art biochemical, cellular and genetic approaches to understand
mechanistically how ssDNA binding proteins protect telomeres from activating a DNA damage
response, regulate its length and replication. Using novel in vitro biochemical assays, we will
examine whether the molecular distinctions between RPA and hPOT1 underlie their unique
functions at telomeres. We will define the residues in hPOT1 that are required to repress telomere
end protection and C-strand resection (Aim 1). We will determine mechanistically how POT1b
promotes telomere length maintenance, and use hematopoietic stem cells conditionally depleted
of endogenous POT1a/b to define the amino acid residues involved in telomere elongation
necessary for the stem cell maintenance (Aim 2). We will explore how POT1a protects telomeres
from replication stress. Finally, we used BioID to identify Claspin as a telomere interacting protein
involved in DNA replication at telomeres devoid of POT1a (Aim 3). The proposed studies present
a unique opportunity to address some of the most important questions in the telomere field."
10752987,"Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss among Veterans
aged 50 years and older. AMD also adversely affects mortality, physical and cognitive
functioning, and activities of daily living. These debilitations negatively impact quality of life for
US Veterans. Unfortunately, there are no cures and few treatments. With the increase in the
aging Veteran population and the increasing prevalence of AMD, it is imperative to identify and
implement strategies to limit the functional burden of AMD. To address this growing challenge,
we propose to test the impact of a proven exercise intervention, stationary bicycling (spinning),
on visual and non-visual negative health outcomes in AMD. Our work in several retinal
degeneration mouse models shows that aerobic exercise significantly preserves retinal
morphology and function and visual acuity. Even more exciting, our preliminary work with older
Veterans with and without AMD suggests that spin cycling modestly but significantly benefits
visual acuity in aged Veterans. Based on this work, we propose to implement a 6-month
synchronous, online group spin cycling program for Veterans with AMD, evaluating effects on
physical, cognitive, and visual outcomes. Aim 1 is to determine if exercise training preserves
visual outcomes in Veterans with intermediate AMD when compared to a non-aerobic
exercised, contact-controlled AMD group. Best corrected visual acuity, dark adaptometry,
contrast sensitivity, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and the Low
Luminance Questionnaire will be assessed before, mid, and after the 6-month interventional
period. In line with our previous animal and human subject studies, we also hypothesize a
correlation between improved visual function with increases in serum brain derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF). Aim 2 is to determine if exercise improves physical and cognitive function in
Veterans with AMD when compared to non-aerobic exercised, contact-controlled AMD group.
We will test the timed-up-and-go (TUG) and a neuropsychological battery, mid- and post 6-
month interventional period. These provide a robust index of other health, well-being, and
quality of life related outcomes in numerous older adult patient populations. In line with our
preliminary studies, our working hypothesis is that 6 months of exercise will result in a clinically
significant improvement in TUG performance as well as improved cognitive-executive functions.
We expect that the results from achieving these aims will set the stage for a larger, multi-site
trial powered to test the hypothesis that virtual exercise can slow the progression of AMD while
improving physical and cognitive function and quality of life in Veterans. Thus, we propose an
accessible, low-cost intervention that can be easily scalable to other VA centers to improve
engagement/adherence, while also improving visual and functional capacity for Veterans with
AMD who are at high risk for comorbidities."
10868515,"Project Summary/Abstract
Currently, clinical applications of intravascular catheters suffer from major challenges: 1) infection; and 2) platelet
activation and surface-induced thrombosis. Bacterial contamination of catheters causes more than 28,000
deaths per year in the United States, as well as costing the healthcare industry a staggering $2.3 billion.
Thrombus formation can further lead to obstruction of blood vessels, catheter malfunction, or even life-
threatening situations such as embolism. Commercial catheters with heparin-bonded surfaces are available to
prevent clotting, but do little to prevent infections. In addition, antiseptics or antibiotics catheter coatings or lock
solutions decrease the risk of bacterial infection, but do not prevent biofilm formation that shields bacteria from
antibiotics. Therefore, there is a necessity and opportunity to develop device strategies for preventing infection
and thrombosis on indwelling catheters for enhanced patency and safety.
Our work and others have demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) release from polymer surfaces can prevent platelet
activation and bacterial infection. This technology mimics the vascular endothelial cells lining the blood vessels,
as well as other cells in our bodies, producing NO locally to prevent clotting and bacterial biofilm. Recently we
discovered that all of the positive effects can be achieved from polymers physically blended with the NO donor
molecule S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), which is nontoxic, inexpensive, and easy to synthesize.
Active NO release from the NO donors in polymers reduces infection and thrombosis on catheters; however, the
NO-release polymer strategy alone is limited by the finite reservoir of NO donor functionalities within the catheter
wall which limits the duration of the NO availability/release. Our recent work has shown the potential of
developing a catheter hub device that utilizes photoactive NO-releasing polymers with side glowing fiber optics
that enables controllable NO release levels. The goal of this proposal is to develop a catheter hub device
comprised of a polymer utilizing a NO donor covalently bonded to the polymer with side glowing fiber
optics to provide photoactive NO-release (without leaching) to provide long-term, tunable NO-release at
the catheter interface to provide potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and reduce thrombosis
by inhibiting platelet adhesion/activation. The new device will be applicable to any catheter device; however,
this proposal will focus on studying the combined photoactive NO-releasing catheter hub device in long-term
intravascular catheters for the prevention of infection and thrombosis. Successful completion of this project will
allow progression to early clinical trials and the development of a new generation of devices that can be inserted
within the lumen of indwelling catheters to prevent these complications while improving patient care."

Spine pain is among the most common and disabling health conditions for both non-Hispanic whites (NHWs)
and racial/ethnic minorities. Although Hispanics often report more severe musculoskeletal pain than NHWs,
they are less likely to consult a healthcare professional for pain management, and health care providers are
less likely to assess and treat pain in Hispanic patients. The overall objective of this proposal is to adapt and
test evidence-based, culturally informed practices at multiple levels of influence along the healthcare
continuum to improve access to and engagement in physical rehabilitation as a non-pharmacological treatment
option for Hispanics with spine pain. Aim 1 proposes a mixed-methods approach to adapt and manualize a
multilevel intervention to address modifiable factors contributing to ethnic disparities in rates of physician
referral and patient adherence to physical therapy referral for spine pain in a Federally Qualified Health Center
(FQHC) serving diverse, low-income communities near the US-Mexico border. Aim 2 will then assess
effectiveness of the manualized intervention, referred to as STEPPT (Salud de tu Espalda: Primary Care to
Physical Therapy), using a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge clinical trial in the FQHC setting. Compared to
standard care, we hypothesize that STEPPT will significantly reduce ethnic disparities in rates of physician
referral and patient adherence to physical therapy referral for spine pain. Successful completion of the
proposed aims will provide underserved Hispanic communities with scalable, sustainable, and effective options
for engaging in culturally appropriate pain care. This approach can serve as a model for FQHCs and other
healthcare systems to mitigate disparities in specialty services for a variety of health conditions that
disproportionately impact ethnic and racial minorities."
10784752,"REVISED PROJECT SUMMARY

Subretinal fibrosis is an end-stage fibrous plaque/disciform scar that progresses from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) during neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Subretinal fibrosis compromises highly organized anatomical layers and tightly coordinated cellular interactions, inevitably leading to irreversible visual impairment. Current treatment for subretinal fibrosis is limited and thus, therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of subretinal fibrosis are imperative. 
Multiple cell types, including endothelial cells (ECs), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, macrophages, and glial cells, contribute to subretinal fibrosis by either differentiating into mesenchymal-like cells and further differentiating into α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts and/or producing profibrotic and proinflammatory factors. However, the underlying metabolic mechanisms for these cellular and molecular activities remain poorly defined. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway utilized by many proliferative cells. Our preliminary data show that cells in subretinal fibrotic areas are hyper-glycolytic, as evidenced by high levels of glycolytic enzymes and glycolytic regulators/activators including 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (Pfkfb3), a critical enzyme for activation of glycolysis in various highly proliferative cells. Pfkfb3 catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2, 6P2), which is the most potent allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis. We have demonstrated that high levels of glycolytic enzymes including Pfkfb3 are present in the RPE/choroid complex isolated from laser-induced and spontaneous subretinal fibrosis in C57BL/6j mice and very low–density lipoprotein receptor deficient (Vldlr-/-) mice and that the area of subretinal fibrosis is markedly decreased in Pfkfb3-/+ mice. Our in vitro studies have also shown that PFKFB3/Pfkfb3 deletion in myeloid cells inhibits their transition to myofibroblast cells as well as reducing their production of proinflammatory and profibrotic factors. We hypothesize that Pfkfb3-mediated glycolysis in myeloid cells induces their transition to myofibroblasts and induces their production of profibrotic and proinflammatory factors by activating HIFs pathways, eventually leading to the development of subretinal fibrosis. To test our hypothesis, we have generated a variety of genetic mice and established mouse subretinal fibrosis models with laser-induced CNV and spontaneous CNV in Vldlr-/- mice. We will investigate the effect on subretinal fibrosis of Pfkfb3 deficiency or inhibition in myeloid cells using specific genetic and pharmacological tools with an integrated approach of in vivo and in vitro models. Our study will define the role of PFKFB3-mediated metabolism in myeloid cells in the development of subretinal fibrosis and validate inhibition of myeloid PFKFB3 as a novel strategy for the treatment of subretinal fibrosis."

Blacks are more likely than whites to experience the deaths of multiple family members and experience them
at earlier ages. Between 1970-2004, an estimated 2.7 million excess black deaths occurred because of blacks’
elevated mortality rates. Further, the estimated 600,000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of July 2021 have
directly impacted the lives of more than 5.3 million individuals in nuclear families according to a bereavement
multiplier, with blacks facing twice the risk of death from COVID-19 as whites. Although experiencing death
within a family or network powerfully shapes survivors’ health, we know little about how network death
contributes to health inequities. The objective of the proposed study is to quantify black–white disparities in
familial and household exposure to deaths and their relationship to disparities in psychological distress and all-
cause mortality. My specific aims are to: 1) quantify the prevalence of and racial disparities in network mortality
by lifecourse stage and socioeconomic status (SES) for blacks and whites, exploring differences before and
during COVID-19; 2) identify key perceived mechanisms through which exposure to death may impact the
SES–health feedback loop throughout the lifecourse and intergenerationally for blacks and whites using semi-
structured interviews, exploring differences before and during COVID-19; and 3a) estimate the contribution of
exposure to premature and cumulative deaths to black–white inequalities in psychological distress, before and
during COVID-19, and to all-cause mortality; and 3b) determine the extent to which SES mediates the
relationship of network mortality with psychological distress and all-cause mortality for blacks and whites. To
do this, I will analyze data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and conduct semi-structured
interviews with black and white adults in Atlanta, GA. This project is innovative in its focus on examining racial
disparities in death from broader social network ties including extended kin and household members as well as
how network deaths can initiate a cascade of SES consequences that contribute to adverse health for
survivors. This K01 project will enhance my prior sociological training in race, racism, socioeconomic
inequality, and demography with additional training in: 1) social epidemiology, with a focus on racial health
inequities; 2) network analysis, survival analysis, and structural equation modeling; 3) qualitative and mixed
methods; and 4) use of PSID data. My access to excellent resources and mentoring at Emory University is
supplemented with affiliations at Harvard University and the University of Michigan. Study findings will provide
an evidence base for efforts to reform bereavement and family leave policies that do not account for the
collateral health effects of individuals embedded in networks beyond the traditional nuclear family. The K01 will
facilitate my transition to a scientific leader advancing policy-relevant research examining the degree to which
racial health inequalities reverberate across social networks and generations to (re)produce health inequities."

Pathogens are one of the strongest selective pressures on the human genome. As modern humans migrated
out of Africa, they encountered markedly different pathogenic environments, likely resulting in population-specific
selection of immune phenotypes. Consistent with this hypothesis, some of the most compelling evidence for
local positive selection in the human genome has been detected among genes involved in immunity and host
defense. Yet, our understanding of the role that local adaptation plays in shaping phenotypic variation in immune
responses across populations is still in its infancy. To better understand the complex relationship between
pathogens and host adaptation we propose to explore the effects of natural selection and genetic ancestry on
gene expression, epigenetic traits, and immune responses to infection across a large array of human
populations. Our research program is grounded on three outstanding questions in the fields of genomics,
population variation in host response to pathogens, and evolutionary biology: (i) the degree to which immune
responses to pathogens are differentiated across ancestry groups; (ii) the genetic variants that account for such
differences; and (iii) the evolutionary mechanisms (neutral genetic drift vs positive selection) that led to the
establishment of these variants in modern human populations. Addressing these questions is not only important
for understanding the recent evolution of the human immune system but may also help reveal the molecular
basis to interindividual differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases, chronic inflammatory disorders, and
autoimmune disorders."

My lab studies the molecular biology of archaeal microorganisms. Our rationale for doing so lies
in the evolutionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes. Archaeal possess information
machineries that are in essence a simplified, ancestral version of the eukaryotic machinery.
Viewing these machineries through the prism of archaea provides a unique perspective on the
fundamentally conserved molecular mechanisms of genome duplication and expression. We
have investigated these processes for many years and have in vitro systems in place for both
DNA replication and gene transcription. More recently, we have discovered that archaea of the
order Sulfolobales organize their genomes with a compartmentalized architecture –
reminiscent of that seen in higher eukaryotes. Our work has revealed a key role for a simple,
small SMC-superfamily protein, termed ClsN, in establishing and maintaining this
compartmentalized architecture. We are now ideally poised to integrate our chromosome
architecture studies with our DNA replication work, to investigate the interplay between
genome organization and the dynamic processes of DNA replication and gene expression
through combined in vitro, single-molecule and in vivo approaches. With regard to gene
expression, we have recently described an unanticipated role for ClsN in effecting an epigenetic
state in Sulfolobus. We will dissect the mechanistic basis of this state, determine how applicable
it is to other regulatory systems in Sulfolobus and investigate the mechanistic basis of the multi-
generational inheritance of ClsN-mediated conformational marks. Taken together, our work will
reveal novel insights into the core molecular biology of archaea. Additionally, due to the
relationship between archaea and eukaryotes, our work will provide a novel perspective on the
evolution and core mechanisms of orthologous processes in eukaryotes."

The central goal of this project is to develop new sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reactions to
construct small-molecule libraries containing the SVI-F motif and to explore their in vitro and in
vivo functions. SuFEx is a new family of click chemistry transformations for generating diverse
chemical structures bearing the SVI-F motif, such as -OSO2F (fluorosulfate), -SO2F (sulfonyl
fluoride) and iminosulfur oxydifluorides. In the last seven years, we have established three
versatile SulfurVI connectors: sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2), ethenesulfonyl fluoride (ESF), and thionyl
tetrafluoride (SOF4). SO2F2 selectively reacts with the – OH group of phenols to form aryl
fluorosulfates, whereas SOF4 selectively reacts with primary amines to form iminosulfur
oxydifluorides. Based on the aryl fluorosulfate chemistry, we invented extremely fast fluoride
exchange reactions to introduce the fluorine-18 isotope into biologically active small-molecule
radiotracers for positron emission tomography. By screening aryl fluorosulfate-based libraries, we
discovered small-molecule covalent modifiers for Intracellular Lipid Binding Protein(s) and a
platform for the late-stage drug functionalization. Building upon the above exciting discoveries,
we will develop new transformations to expand the SuFEx transformation repertory and explore
the feasibility of expanding fluoride exchange reactions to stable phosphorous(V) hubs. We will
apply these new chemical transformations to construct screen libraries that can be used for rapid
hit-to-lead optimization and for the development of covalent inhibitors and to construct stable 18F
radiotracers for PET imaging."

Decades of population research show that married Americans are in better health and live longer than their
unmarried peers and that there are gender differences in how spouses influence each other’s health. Until
recently, however, this research was entirely based on marriages between women and men. In 2015, with NIA
support (R21 AG0445850), we collected dyadic data to conduct the first in-depth analysis of marital processes

highlighted differences in health-related marital dynamics for women and men in same- and different-sex

health behaviors and mental and physical health from mid- to later life. In 2015, we collected survey data on
relationship dynamics, relationship and health histories, and multiple health outcomes from both spouses (ages
35–65) in legally married same- and different-sex marriages (N=838 individuals, 419 dyads; 124 same-sex men
couples, 171 same-sex women couples; 124 different-sex couples). We also collected 10 days of daily diary data
to assess daily fluctuation in partner dynamics, stress exposure, health behaviors, and psychological and
physical symptoms. We propose a Time 2 and Time 3 longitudinal follow-up to: (1) Advance scientific
understanding of how relationship dynamics that influence long-term health trajectories may vary for women
and men in same- and different-sex marriages; (2) Elucidate how patterns in daily experiences of health-related
marital dynamics change across 3 occasions spanning 8 years and how these dynamics vary for women and men
in same- and different-sex marriages; and (3) Link the daily diary and survey data to consider how short-term
fluctuations in relationship processes affect longer-term change in multiple health outcomes. Based on results
from the 2015 baseline survey and diary data, we expect that over time, women and men in same- and different-
sex marriages will develop unique patterns of risk (e.g., health-damaging behaviors, stress and distress
transmission) and resilience (e.g., emotional support, caregiving, emotion regulation) that affect health. Many
of the most important questions about the cumulative effects of marital dynamics on health and how those
dynamics change as spouses age require longitudinal data—data that do not currently exist for same-sex
couples. The novel cross-sectional dyadic data collected through NIA R21 AG044585 provide a unique
opportunity for a longitudinal data collection on aging same- and different-sex married couples. Analysis of
these data will provide evidence-based knowledge about the processes that link marital dynamics to health as
spouses age and how these processes vary for women and men in same- and different-sex marriages."
10766718,"The Tufts Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) provides recent college graduates from
groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences with innovative training that integrates career and cultural
skills with intense research training as a means to transition to and excel in top-ranked biomedical PhD or
MD/PhD programs. Our mentors are high-achieving multidisciplinary faculty drawn from six graduate programs
at Tufts, specifically screened and trained as mentors for the PREP program. Trainees work on independent
research projects akin to graduate students thesis projects. The program complements hands-on research
training with a unique year-long PREP course designed to advance analytic, quantitative, and statistical skills in
basic science, and to develop oral and written presentation skills. Another important element of the Tufts PREP
program is that each trainee affiliates with a PhD program at the Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences
(GSBS) and participates in its academic and social activities. This affiliation fosters the trainee’s self-identification
as a research scientist and prevents isolation. We also implement the use of Individual Development Plans
(IDPs) and provide training for both the trainee and the faculty mentor to maximize their benefit. Trainees then
receive individualized support during the graduate school application process. We continuously adjust and
improve the program based on trainee and faculty feedback and a robust evaluation strategy that monitors the
effectiveness of all program elements. The Tufts PREP receives generous support from the University and the
School of Medicine, which together provide funding for three new trainees each year. This high level of support
underscores Tufts’ strong institutional commitment to the PREP program and to promoting diversity in the
biomedical sciences. The success of our training program is illustrated by over 50 research publications
generated by our PREP trainees, including nine for which the trainees were first authors. Moreover, 75% of the
trainees who completed training over the last 5 years entered graduate biomedical programs, improving on our
outcomes of the prior 15 years (70%). In this renewal application, we restructure our program to shorten time in
training to one year and add innovative programming to further increase success. New components include an
introductory course designed to help incoming trainees identify strategies to build confidence and resilience, self-
identify as a scientist, engender a sense of community, and establish support networks. A new module in the
PREP course will focus on critical thinking and scientific practice as well as rigor and reproducibility. Trainees
will be required to take a GSBS graduate biomedical course to introduce them to the rigors of graduate school
and build their academic portfolio. They will also participate in a new program that will provide continued coaching
after they enter graduate school. With strong support from the institution, faculty, and broader Tufts community,
Tufts PREP will augment our URG trainees’ academic, scientific, and social skills essential for success in
graduate school, and contribute longterm to a more diverse biomedical workforce and biomedical leadership."
10766725,"Project Summary
There is currently an unmet need for accurate model systems of the human brain to study its cellular and
molecular features. The cerebral cortex regulates our cognitive capacity, yet the cellular diversity, circuit
formation, and function that establish this potential, largely remains a mystery. The cortex is expanded in humans
compared to other species; it contains more cellular diversity and abundance, making model organisms limited
for translational studies. Brain organoids provide access to human cells for experimental manipulation and recent
studies have suggested that organoid models may act as a proxy for the human brain when studying
developmental trajectories, circuitry, and a variety of complex neurological diseases. However, using single cell
RNA sequencing we performed validation studies of cortical organoid models compared to primary human cortex
cells and we discovered several significant deficiencies in organoid cells. First, organoids do not make the same
refined cell types with clear gene expression programs observed during normal cortex development. They also
lack molecular maturation networks observed endogenously. As organoid cells do not make the specific, refined
cell types we observe in the human brain, these models are severely limited when aiming to model circuit activity
and disease. Circuits are comprised of highly specialized neuronal subtypes that target one another to wire
defined connections and ultimately produce appropriate physiological activity. We require organoid models that
make specific cell types that can mature enough to form the building blocks of canonical circuits to enable the
study of neural connectivity moving forward. In addition to cell type deficiencies, all organoids assayed,
regardless of derivation method, express high levels of metabolic stress. Using transplantation studies, we
identified that cellular stress is linked to the in vitro environment, it negatively impacts cell type identity, and it
can be reversed by removal from culture conditions. My proposed studies will directly address the current
technical limitations of organoid models by intervening in the metabolic dysregulation with the goal of improving
cell type specification and maturation. First, I will target glycolytic and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways,
using small molecules to inhibit these processes and by modulating glucose and oxygen concentrations. I will
also utilize knowledge of relevant signaling pathways in human cortex development, such as the LIF signaling
pathway, which is an important regulator of a human-enriched population of cortical stem cells. Second, I will
work to identify the relevant non-neural cells required for normal metabolic regulation endogenously, which are
absent from organoid models. To work toward this aim I will use transplantation of human organoid-derived cells
into the mouse cortex environment and transplant relevant vascular and immune cells into cortical organoids in
vitro. Together, these studies will improve current technical limitations in metabolism and cell type impairment to
ensure that organoids more accurately reflect the cellular diversity of the human cortex and provide a tractable
model system for the study of human neuroscience."

This resubmission of a new R01 application proposes to define mechanisms of gastric stem cell regulation,
investigating the role of Wnt signaling to maintain tissue homeostasis and to promote epithelial cell proliferation
in the stomach. Our proposed studies are directly relevant to human disease, focusing on mechanisms of
gastric polyp formation in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a genetic disorder
resulting from germline APC gene mutations that dysregulate Wnt signaling, with extreme gastrointestinal (GI)
proliferative disease resulting from Wnt promotion of stem cell proliferation. Although Wnt is well known to
regulate GI stem cells, questions remain regarding sensitivity to Wnt dysregulation in different regions of the GI
tract. Colonic manifestations in FAP patients are extreme, with aggressive disease characterized by early
adenoma and cancer development, which commonly leads to colectomy at a young age. The consequences of
Wnt dysregulation in gastric stem cells is less well understood, although polyp, adenoma and cancer
development are enhanced in the FAP patient stomach. Notably, almost all FAP patients exhibit frequent
hyperproliferative polyps localized to the proximal fundic/corpus region of the stomach, while, in contrast, the
distal antral/pylorus region of the stomach is relatively spared from these polyps and develops more occasional
adenomatous growths. The basis for the regional effect of FAP mutations on corpus vs. antral stem cells and
gastric tissue responses is unknown. To address this important question, this project focuses on defining Wnt
regulation of gastric stem cells to uncover the differential effects of pathway activation in the proximal vs. distal
stomach. We will pursue the mechanisms of FAP polyp formation in the stomach by functional and genetic
analysis of gastric polyp and non-polyp organoids and tissues from a biobank of human FAP gastric tissue
samples that will be built as a component of this study. Human FAP organoid studies will be complemented by
mouse genetic, pharmacologic and organoid models to gain deeper mechanistic insight into regional Wnt
regulation of gastric stem cells. The studies are framed by the “Just Right Hypothesis” which defines
differential sensitivities along the GI tract based on region-specific stem cell responses to different levels of
Wnt activation. Together the proposed studies will determine how dysregulated Wnt signaling leads to
differential gastric epithelial cell proliferation and polyp formation in proximal vs. distal stomach. This
information will establish a scientific framework to help define the gastric manifestations in FAP patients. In
addition, the studies will provide functional insights to develop a deeper understanding of Wnt pathway
regulation of gastrointestinal stem cells. Furthermore, understanding mechanisms of Wnt pathway regulation of
gastric stem cell function is important to refine strategies to propagate adult stem cells in culture for
regenerative therapies as well as to develop diagnostic criteria and potential therapies for gastric
hyperproliferative diseases."

Over one-third of children in the U.S. are overweight or obese and at risk for short-term and long-term health
consequences, including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and certain types of cancer. Substantial
evidence exists on reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption as a critical dietary target for
childhood obesity prevention. Efficacious behavioral interventions targeting SSBs are lacking, particularly
among low-income and ethnic minority early and pre-adolescent youth who have higher SSB intake and
obesity risk. Youth empowerment interventions hold potential for catalyzing behavior change in childhood
obesity intervention contexts and may be particularly engaging for low-income and ethnic minority youth.
However, few studies of youth empowerment health interventions have utilized rigorous study designs or
examined empowerment as a mediator/mechanism of change. To this gap, we worked collaboratively with
Boys and Girls Clubs of America (BGCs), a national system of afterschool care that reaches 4 million youth
annually, to develop and pilot-test a community-based youth empowerment intervention on reducing SSB
intake and preventing childhood obesity. Grounded in Empowerment Theory, the intervention targets SSB
consumption through health sessions that empower youth through developing their confidence and skills;
narrative sessions that empower youth through cultivating critical thinking, and youth-led activities that
empower youth through opportunities to produce change within their families. The resulting H2GO! intervention
is designed to be delivered within BGCs by BGC staff. Building on our successful pilot study of H2GO!, we are
now positioned to test the efficacy of the H2GO! intervention in collaboration with the BGC network in MA,
which collectively serves over 160,000 children each year. Using a cluster-randomized design, a total of 10
BGC sites will be randomly assigned to the H2GO! intervention or a wait-list, usual care condition. A total of
450 parent-child pairs (N=45 parent-child pairs per site) will be enrolled. Data will be collected at baseline, 2
months, 6 months, and 12 months and include child anthropometrics, SSB and water intake, and youth
empowerment. Specific aims of the proposal include: 1) test the efficacy of the H2GO! intervention on child BMI
z scores using a cluster randomized controlled trial; 2) test the efficacy of the H2GO! intervention on child SSB
and water intake; 3) examine youth empowerment as a mediator of intervention effects. Findings from this
proposal will provide evidence of youth empowerment as an approach to reduce SSB intake and obesity risk
and contribute to a long-term goal of producing an intervention model for childhood obesity prevention that is
well-positioned for dissemination through youth-based settings."

The Administrative Core (Core A) will serve as the hub of the proposed NIAID PPG entitled “The Role of
Senescent Cells in Dysregulating Immune Response and Pathogen Control” comprised of three research
projects and two research resource Cores (Cores B and C). The PIs of Core A are Dr. Stephen Jameson,
Professor in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at UMN and an expert in adaptive immune
responses to pathogens, and Dr. Laura Niedernhofer, Director of the Institute on the Biology of Aging and
Metabolism (iBAM) at UMN, an expert in cellular senescence and mouse models of accelerated senescence
and aging. Both have led and/or been involved in several NIH P and U series grants. Overall, this PPG will
examine the effect of age and increased senescent cell (SnC) burden on immune function. To do so, we propose
an interdisciplinary approach combining the expertise of leaders in the fields of the biology of aging and
immunology, leveraging the synergies provided by these interactions coordinated around two Scientific Cores
(one for sophisticated transgenic models and pathogen exposure paradigms, the other for complex single-cell
and spatial analysis of tissues). The overall goals of the Administrative Core A will be to ensure this team is
working effectively together by providing general scientific, programmatic and fiscal leadership, and by facilitating
lines of communication between the three projects and two research cores. The Core A will maintain the
cohesiveness and coherence of the program and long-range goals to ensure that resources resulting from the
research will benefit the scientific community. As senior scientists, the PIs of Core A will also foster the career
development of the early-stage faculty in the Program as well as trainees in all Projects and Cores. The Specific
Aims of Core A are to: 1) Plan and coordinate the proposed research activities of the PPG, monitor progress,
and ensure sound fiscal and resource management in compliance with NIH regulations; 2) Ensure regular and
thorough internal and external evaluation of scientific quality and guarantee continued progress of the research
of the PPG; 3) Working with the other cores, organize and prioritize the exchange of personnel, information,
reagents, cell, tissues, and mice among the different projects and cores and to mobilize new tools, technology
and data resources to help the PPG researchers efficiently accomplish their goals and disseminate their results
to the broader scientific community in a timely fashion; 4) Coordinate the interactions between Research Projects
and Cores."

The Mouse and Infection Models Core (Core B), will be directed by Dr. Hamilton Hart, with Dr.
Niedernhofer as Co-I. This is an integral component of the PPG. The Core will be utilized by all
three proposed projects and will allow PPG investigators to examine senescence and different
immunological features of young and aged mice exposed to pathogens using both wildtype mice
and genetically engineered mouse strains. Our recent studies determined that the vulnerability
of aged mice to infection can be overcome with either short term senolytic treatment or genetic
ablation of senescent cells, which reduced SASP levels and supported the development of anti-
viral responses. This proposal will expand upon these novel findings and develop a mechanistic
understanding of how the senescent cell burden, which increases with age and disease, affects
the response of specific immune cell populations after infection. Core B will generate and
validate stocks of acute viruses and expose mice to a diverse microbial milieu via pet store
mouse fomite bedding. We will produce mouse lines composed of chronologically aged mice
and comparison young mouse cohorts. We will also characterize and expand novel mouse
models generated by Project 1 in which accelerated aging is driven in specific immune cells and
in which cells expressing senescence markers p16 and p21 can be identified or inducibly
ablated. Centralizing the breeding, maintenance, and expansion of these different mouse strains
allows for comparison and standardization of results between the three inter-related projects
and increased efficiency while reducing cost. Centralizing the infection paradigms and
employing quality control standards will increase the rigor of experiments. Lastly, to further
ensure rigor and reproducibility, Core B will utilize a unique data base called MouseCloud, to
track mice and tissues as they are generated and distributed for use by the Projects and Core
C. These unique tools will be used to test project-specific hypotheses focused on how
senescence in distinct cell types contribute to immune dysfunction."
10767637,"Senescent cells (SnCs) increase in tissues with age and are established to play a causal role in aging and age-
related conditions/syndromes. SnCs confer their adverse effects, at least in part, through their senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is pro-inflammatory. A particularly debilitating, deadly, and costly
condition that plagues the elderly is susceptibility to severe morbidity and mortality upon infection. The recent
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illuminated this problem dramatically. Why are older COVID-19 patients at higher risk
(>350X) of cytokine storm, multi-organ failure and death upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger
individuals? Similarly, why are the elderly more susceptible to progression to sepsis and acute respiratory
distress syndrome upon infection? We hypothesize it is because of the increased SnC burden in the elderly with
their inflammatory SASP that drives chronic sterile inflammation and dysregulates the innate and adaptive
immune responses of older individuals with infection. We developed a novel experimental paradigm in which to
test this hypothesis called normal microbial experience (NME). Specified pathogen-free (SPF) mice are exposed
to pet store as a model of “community acquired infections.” The pet store mice carry mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),
a ß-coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Young SPF survive NME, but old mice experience 100%
mortality within two weeks. This is due to an increased inflammatory response in old mice compared to young
upon NME exposure. Pharmacologic or genetic approaches to clear SnCs after NME reduced mortality of old
mice by 50% and improved adaptive immunity against MHV. We found that in vitro and in vivo, SnCs hyper-
respond to challenge with pathogen-associated molecular patterns compared to healthy cells, leading to
increased expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Additionally, we found that senescent immune cells
are particularly deleterious and able to drive secondary senescence and tissue damage through both gain-of
function and loss-of function mechanisms. While provocative, there remains large gaps in knowledge, which if
addressed offer completely novel approaches to improving immune function and preventing severe infections
in the elderly. Here, we propose to identify the senescent immune and other SnC type(s) that impede resilience
to pathogens in old mice and the mechanism(s) involved. To prove cause and effect and move towards
translation, we propose in this Project to identify the key SnCs as possible therapeutic targets and optimize
senotherapeutic drugs to improve the immune response in aged mice. To address the role of SnCs in driving
immune dysfunction, the Specific Aims of Project 1 are: 1) To identify the SnCs that drive adverse outcomes and
immune dysfunction upon exposure of aged mice to environmental microbes, viral infection, or LPS; 2) To
determine if removal of SnCs is sufficient to prevent mortality and improve immune function upon exposure of
mice to environmental pathogens, viral infection, or LPS; and 3) To optimize senotherapeutic strategies to
improve the immune response of aged mice."
10767638,"Summary
 The induction and maintenance of adaptive immune responses are critical for effective and durable
protection against diverse pathogens and the efficacy of vaccines. Yet it is known that both the homeostasis
and function of adaptive immune cells declines with age – while there may be multiple causes for this, recent
studies (including those from our group) indicate a potentially pivotal role for senescent cells. Diverse cell
types (including immune cells) become senescent with age and in various chronic disease states, and this
state not only affects the replicative potential of the senescent cells (SnC) themselves, but by their production
of a variety of factors (in what is termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype or SASP), they can
affect other cells, in trans. Many of these SASP factors are pro-inflammatory and can provoke
immunopathology in vulnerable populations (including the aged, as illustrated in the cytokine storm reported in
elderly COVID-19 patients). These “bystander” effects have been demonstrated in experimental mouse
models. Most exciting, ablation of SnC (using senotherapeutic compounds) results in marked improvement of
immune control of pathogens. However, there is a key knowledge gap in understanding what effect SnCs
have on adaptive immune populations, how those effects are mediated and how crosstalk between senescent
and immune cells influences the physiological establishment of senescence with age. We address these in
three Specific Aims. Aim 1 tests how exposure to SnC – as a single variable – influences adaptive immune cell
homeostasis and function in response to defined viral infections, using well defined mouse models to pinpoint
the consequences of SnC introduction vs destruction on naïve and memory T and B cell populations. This
includes functional and single-cell analysis approaches. In Aim 2, we turn the tables by investigating tantalizing
data which indicate certain immune populations (including NK cells) may be capable of SnC destruction during
normal physiology – a feedback loop that we suspect is compromised with age, resulting in SnC build up. The
function of NK cells and other immune populations in culling SnC will be explored. Aim 3 explores how SnC
mediate their inhibitory effects on lymphocytes – by harnessing the power of CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to
ablate receptors for SASP factors and explore the functional significance of immunoregulatory molecules
induced on “young” T cells in the aged environment, as well as test the ability of SASP factors to provoke these
age-related changes, in vitro in both mouse and human cells. The approaches and goals integrate with the
single-cell studies, novel mouse model development and refinement of senotherapeutics conducted in Project
1, and with complementary studies on generation, homeostasis and function of adaptive immune cells
embedded in non-lymphoid tissues, conducted in Project 3. A consistent source of the key mouse models and
pathogens used will be provided by Core B, while all the single-cell analysis from Project 2 and the other
Projects will be conducted and integrated by Core C. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee
coordinated work of Projects and Cores and establish internal and external review."

Defining the causal mechanisms that mediate risk for obesity development in early life and how risk can be modified by psychosocial, contextual, and/or environmental factors, requires systems biology integration, which is currently lacking. The objective of this application is to develop predictive algorithms for childhood obesity risk by integrating data on growth trajectories, body composition, and dietary intake with multi omic (genetic, epigenetic and microbiome) data sets and assessments of temperament-self-regulation and child eating behavior across early childhood. We will leverage a rich biobank of longitudinal biological samples, questionnaire, and observational data from the ongoing Synergistic Theory and Research on Nutrition and Growth Kids 2 (SK2) cohort (n=468)11. Our central hypothesis is that computational and systems biology approaches will illuminate interactions between modifiable and non-modifiable obesity-related risk factors to provide predictive indices that identify at-risk individuals in early life. The three specific aims are: Aim 1. Determine how microbial profiles implicated in rapid growth and childhood obesity differentially influence children’s weight gain and body composition and determine whether there are differential associations based on genetic and or epigenetic risk factors; Aim 2. Determine how microbial profiles implicated in executive and emotion processes map onto profiles of child temperament and indicators of self-regulation. Establish the impact of these interacting systems on assessments of children’s eating-related behavior and weight trajectories, and whether there are differential associations based on genetic/epigenetic risk; and Aim 3. Uncover and characterize interactions between dietary components, genetics, fecal microbiota, temperament, and cognitive control on obesity risk using Bayesian and neural networks. These outcomes will enable development of algorithms to predict responses to diet within the context of genetic variation, microbiome composition, temperament and other environmental factors."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies represent a major advancement in the cancer immunotherapy
(IOT) field and have shown remarkable success particularly for treating hematologic malignancies. Despite their
meteoric rise, these “living drugs” face a number of challenges that have limited their widespread utility
(especially for solid tumors), including the inability to discern cell fate after infusion. Growing investment in
developing new CAR T cell therapies and the desire to optimize existing ones highlights the urgent unmet need
for techniques that permit non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of CAR T cell fate. An imaging method
that enables sensitive detection of activated T cells, including CAR T cells, in vivo has the potential to reveal
mechanisms underlying failures, thus enhancing our ability to design and optimize IOTs. Immuno-positron
emission tomography (immunoPET), a rapidly expanding area of molecular imaging that combines ultra-specific
antibodies or antibody fragments with PET radioisotopes, has enormous potential to shed light on the in vivo
spatiotemporal distribution and functional status of CAR T cells. Unfortunately, there are no clinically approved
gold-standard immunoPET radiotracers, or other imaging techniques, that target T cell activation markers.
Recently, we identified OX40 and ICOS (two cell-surface antigens that are highly and specifically upregulated
on activated T cells) as promising biomarkers for imaging T cell responses. Subsequently, we developed the first
PET radio
tracer
s to image murine OX40 and ICOS by radiolabeling monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with 64Cu or
89Zr and demonstrated their utility for quantifying and tracking activated T cells in a variety of cancer IOT models.
We also verified that both OX40 and ICOS are significantly upregulated on activated human and murine CD19-
CAR T cells, and that ICOS immunoPET enables visualization of the latter in vivo. In this R01, we propose to
build on our promising preclinical data by developing the first human-specific radiotracers for OX40 and ICOS,
utilizing mAbs and F(ab’)2 fragments. We have performed preliminary 89Zr- radiolabeling of human-OX40 and -
ICOS mAbs and demonstrated their specificity for human activated T cells. Additionally, we have acquired highly
encouraging in vivo imaging and stability data for our novel human OX40-mAb radiotracer. Aim 1 involves
optimizing radiolabeling for ICOS and OX40 mAbs, generating and labeling F(ab’)2 fragments, in addition to
thoroughly assessing stability, affinity, and immunoreactivity of all four new radiotracers. We will then investigate
potential biological effects and in vivo binding of these radiotracers to activated human T cells (Aim 2) and to
CAR T cells, the latter engineered to target liquid and solid tumors (Aim 3). Finally, we will assess the safety of
these radiotracers for CAR T cell imaging (Aim 3). Completing these experiments will provide invaluable data on
the sensitivity and specificity, as well potential biologic effects, of all four imaging agents, guiding their
optimization for our long-term goal of clinical translation. Such OX40 and ICOS PET radiotracers will afford a
new approach for monitoring CAR T cells and other IOTs with great potential to increase their clinical success."

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is associated with a spectrum of clinical
dementias. Despite the enormous risk that TDP-43 proteinopathies present to public health, there
is a lack of strategies against TDP-43 pathology. Our laboratory has discovered that peptidyl
arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) induces the conversion of arginine (positive) to citrulline (neutral), a
novel and irreversible posttranslational modification of TDP-43. We identified elevated PAD4
expression and TDP-43 citrullination (citR) at the outset of Limbic-Predominant Age-related TDP-
43 Encephalopathy (LATE) and in AD Related Dementias (ADRDs). We cross-validated our
findings in a novel TDP-43 mouse model and will utilize it to investigate the mechanistic impact
of PAD4 on TDP-43 phenotype. To date, we know very little about the role of PAD4 in the
progression of LATE and ADRD. Notably, as citR TDP-43 remains elusive, our studies suggest
domain-specific effects of citR moieties on TDP-43 nuclear import, cytoplasmic accumulation, and
phase-separation dynamics. We will address the significant gap and define mechanisms of
Ca2+-coordinated PAD4 activity on TDP-43 toxic gain-of-function in the human brain, mouse
models, and neuronal cells. We state that PAD4-mediated TDP-43 citrullination impairs TDP-
43 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and accelerates cytoplasmic accumulation, ultimately
leading to neuropathology and cognitive decline in LATE. In Aim 1, we will establish how
genetic PADi4 (gene) gain- and loss-of-function regulates TDP-43 nuclear import and cytoplasmic
accumulation and determine PAD4-restricted TDP-43 epitopes in primary neurons. We will also
assess how neuronal PADi4 expression or deletion promotes TDP-43 phenotype, synaptic
dysfunction, and neurobehavioral deficits in a mouse model. Aim 2 will investigate the direct
effects of NLS and LCD-directed pseudo-citR mimetics on TDP-43 nuclear import, accumulation,
and solubility in primary neurons. We will also determine how these citR moieties regulate TDP-
43 liquid-solid separation kinetics. Lastly, we will determine the functional role of pseudo-citR
mimetics on the TDP-43 phenotype in vivo. Aim 3 will determine if PAD4 activity and citR TDP-
43 epitope restriction signatures follow regional vulnerability of the human brain in LATE and
ADRD. The proposed studies will elucidate how PAD4 activity and this novel PTM define
functional consequences that lead to the neuropathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies."

Cells employ nanoscale mechanisms to secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain a variety of functional
ligands on the lipid membrane. This mode of delivery offers an effective strategy to systemically activate
membrane receptors over distance without a need for cell migration and juxtacrine interactions. However, the
intrinsic properties of EVs that enable this function and their mechanisms of action remain generally unclear.
To address these questions, we developed a facile strategy to functionalize EVs with defined multivalent
extracellular ligands that can activate specific cell membrane receptors to induce therapeutic effects. As a
proof-of-concept, we turned to the Notch pathway, since it employs a mechanistically direct, simple mechanism
of activation with direct transcriptional outcomes in the development and homeostasis of most vascularized
organs. Our preliminary data show that Notch ligand functionalized EVs but not synthetic liposomes with a
more rigid formulation reverse edema and vascular permeability after endotoxemia-induced injury in mice. We
also show that the ability of Notch ligand functionalized EVs to restore endothelial barrier function requires the
activation of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in endothelial cells. We will build on these results to test
the hypothesis that Notch ligand functionalized EVs therapeutically restore the endothelial barrier and tissue
function. In Aim 1, we will determine the ideal characteristics that enable Notch ligand functionalized EVs to
restore endothelial barrier integrity. We predict that EVs can sustain deformation during adhesion to cell
membrane receptors under mechanical force due to their unique lipid compositions and water flux capability,
thereby resulting in potent, yet specific activation of downstream pathways. In Aim 2, we will investigate how
Notch ligand loaded EVs restore the endothelial barrier after injury, which Notch receptor is activated, and what
gene targets are expressed. The project is highly multidisciplinary in that it will employ a combination of
expertise in nanotechnology, chemistry, membrane biophysics, cellular and molecular biology, and in vivo
approaches to address the specific aims. Success of the project will enable the generalization of EVs as
nanoscale therapeutic modalities to activate specific molecular pathways via multivalent ligand presentation
that lead to tissue repair and regeneration."

VEXAS (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic) syndrome is a newly identified
inflammatory and hematologic disease caused by somatic mutations in UBA1. Individuals with UBA1 mutations
have clinical manifestations similar to well-established rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and giant
cell arteritis but have unique manifestations including elevated mortality and treatment-refractory disease.
1/14,000 individuals are affected by VEXAS syndrome, and there are no effective treatments due to a limited
understanding of pathogenesis. We propose to further the mechanistic understanding of the disease as a first
step in developing treatments.
VEXAS syndrome is caused by hypomorphic mutations in UBA1 that lead to a reduction in global ubiquitylation.
UBA1 mutations are acquired and occur in the earliest bone marrow progenitor cells, become lineage restricted,
and accumulate within the myeloid lineage and are absent in lymphocytes. We have extensively studied cellular
models and patient derived cells to better understand the mechanism of disease in VEXAS syndrome. We have
identified multiple activated inflammatory pathways, although given the complexity of treatments and symptoms
in patients, these have not revealed pathogenic processes. Similarly, in UBA1 mutant cells there is activation of
the unfolded protein response likely due to accumulation of proteins intended to be degraded. Given the severity
of the disease, the lack of effective therapies, and the limited utility of cellular models to date, we propose here
to focus our work on our newly established mouse models of VEXAS syndrome to understand the cellular and
molecular mechanisms leading to disease. To this end, we will utilize conditional knockout (cKO) UBA1 and
conditional knock-in (cKI) UBA1 VEXAS mutations transgenic mouse lines to determine the contribution of
specific lineages to inflammation, the types of inflammation, downstream pathways mediating inflammation and
finally potential ways to reverse disease. We will study our Uba1 cKO, and cKI lines in bone marrow progenitor,
myeloid, B- and T-cells and determine the role of each cell type in driving organismal inflammation (Aim 1). We
will also look at these cell specific models to identify the molecular signaling pathways altered in cells mediating
inflammation (Aim 2). Finally, we will utilize small molecule activators and inhibitors in candidate pathways such
as ubiquitylation and the unfolded protein response to try to reverse inflammation in mouse and cellular models.

10918161,"Our understanding of primate evolution was transformed by the sequencing and assembly of the human 
reference genome which identified the content and context of genes shared amongst the many different taxa in 
the primate lineage. Subsequent efforts to assemble the genomes of chimpanzees, macaques, and other nonhuman primates further accelerated our under- standing of these and related species. Problematically, these 
genomes were of substantially lesser quality than the human genome and often relied on the human genome for 
long-range scaffolding. Recently however, the advent of long-read sequencing technologies have enabled de 
novo con- struction of complete, accurate vertebrate genome assemblies. These technological advances have 
supported renewed assemblies of a handful of apes and monkeys which are vastly improved providing unique 
insights into the evolution and biology of these species. Nevertheless, complete, accurate, reference quality 
genomes are lacking for the vast majority of the ~500 extant species of primates. Here we propose to construct 
complete reference genomes from 50 diverse primate species spanning 75 million years of evolution. Using 
state-of-the-art long-read sequencing and assem- bly methods we will sequence, assemble, annotate, align, and 
disseminate these genomes as a resource for the community. Source DNA will be derived from the Integrated 
Primate Bioma- terials and Information Resource (IPBIR) at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research 
(Coriell), from a high quality, low-passage, cytogenetically verified collection of cell lines. This resource will 
greatly enhance the potential for research that will advance our understanding of primate evolutionary history, 
population genomics, infectious disease, human origins, and primate biodiversity and conservation."
10771200,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TILTON PROJECT
One of the most difficult challenges for environmental health is to evaluate hazards from exposure to chemical
mixtures. The environmental health science community recognizes a growing need to evaluate toxicity for
structurally diverse PAHs and their transformation and breakdown products in complex mixtures, using
human-relevant and metabolically competent research models. This Biomedical Science Research Project will
assess the toxicity of PAHs in complex mixtures associated with Superfund sites in a 3D human lung model
composed of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) differentiated at the air-liquid interface. We will
quantify the toxicity of PAHs and PAH mixtures targeting lungs via endpoints relevant for multiple exposure
routes (inhalation, diet, dermal). We will rely on benchmark dose modeling to identify a threshold response for
comparison. We will apply integrated RNAseq and functional proteomics to identify mechanisms by which
PAHs exert adverse health outcomes in exposed populations and to identify susceptible individuals in those
populations. The overall goal of this project is to understand how individual PAHs contribute to toxicity in
mixtures and to establish a relationship between chemical exposure and toxicity. We will apply the outcomes of
these studies to assess and communicate human health risk and to evaluate susceptibility for relevant
populations. We propose to achieve these aims: 1) quantify the toxicity of PAHs and PAH mixtures in the 3D
lung model, 2) assess the role of metabolism on the toxicity of individual PAHs in the 3D human lung model
and 3) elucidate the mechanisms of PAH toxicity in the 3D human lung model."

Superfund site managers lack information that would allow them to select the most environmentally sound and
cost-effective remediation strategies. To make a balanced decision, they must understand the behavior of the
entire system: they need to know how toxic chemicals move into and out of the site, when and where those
chemicals move. We propose to discover the fate of bioavailable PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon),
utilizing passive sampling devices (PSD) technologies, to assess bioavailable PAH flux between environmental
compartments. We propose to develop generalizable technology to measure the movement (flux) of PAHs into
and out of Superfund sites. We will determine how PAH movement varies with the seasons and tides. We will
quantify the net movement of PAHs into the local environments via diffusive and advective flux in waters at
different locations, at different times of the day, and in different seasons of the year. We propose to test these
hypotheses: (1) The mass of bioavailable PAH movement between Superfund sediment-water and water-
atmosphere interfaces varies as a function of location, season and tide and (2) The advective flux of
bioavailable PAHs represents a significant fraction of the total PAH flux. We will deliver the first methods to
concurrently quantify spatial and temporal movement of bioavailable PAHs to and from a Superfund site from
sediment, water, and air. These methods will help EPA, remediators, and site managers to prioritize sites for
remediation, optimize remediation strategies for their sites, and evaluate the effectiveness of those strategies.
We propose to conduct the first passive sampling wristband measurements of external exposure to PAHs for
people near Superfund sites. This will give stakeholders and communities a quantitative understanding of
people's external exposure and its dependence on distance, geographic factors, housing, and personal
characteristics. Will also test external exposure to PAHs for the same individuals after remediation. We
propose to test these hypotheses: (3) In communities near Superfund sites, the magnitude of people's external
wristband measured exposure depends on their distance to the site, their housing characteristics, and their
time-activity patterns; and (4) Remediation of a Superfund site will diminish the community's external
exposure to PAHs. We will also convey real-world chemical mixtures from the wristbands to Tanguay and
Tilton, who will test the toxicity of the bioavailable mixtures in the zebrafish model and in human lung cell
cultures. We will collaborate with them in effects-directed analyses to identify toxic components of the
mixtures. In collaboration with the RT and CEC teams, we will describe to stakeholders and communities a)
how external exposure to PAH mixtures varies as a function of location near a Superfund site, b) which
components of the mixtures, if any, may threaten human health, and c) how remediation of a Superfund site
influences the local community's external exposure to PAHs."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused by the collapse of glucose homeostasis mechanisms, and the odds of devel-
oping T2D increase during old age. Beta cells make insulin, a major hormone involved in the regulation of glucose
homeostasis; these cells modulate insulin release in response to changes in blood glucose levels and/or meta-
bolic demands. During T2D and aging, beta cell function and identity become compromised due to activation of
stress pathways. Recent studies by us and others show that aging beta cells experience an underlying state of
chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated with compromised autophagic flux and reduced expres-
sion of beta cell identity markers, while reversal of ER stress rescues beta cell function and identity. It is currently
unknown how beta cell heterogeneity is modulated during the adaptation process in response to changes in
metabolic demands, and how these aspects are affected by aging and/or ER stress. In addition, the spatial
organization of the beta cell epigenome, and its correlation with beta cell gene transcriptional heterogeneity, at
the single cell level remains unknown. This project has the overarching goal of investigating how beta cell epi-
genetic, transcriptional, functional, and cell longevity landscapes are affected by metabolic modulation intro-
duced by changes in diet composition (e.g., calorie restriction (CR), high-fat diet), or during aging and/or ER
stress. Moreover, we will investigate fundamental aspects regarding the spatial (in situ) organization of the beta
cell (epi)genome in 3D, and how this aspect correlates with heterogeneous gene transcriptional patterns. The
experiments in this proposal will leverage single cell multiome transcriptomics, high-resolution light, electron and
stable-isotope microscopy, and quantification of in vivo beta cell function to determine the spatial, molecular, and
functional landscapes of mouse and human beta cells exposed to different metabolic challenges. It is anticipated
that CR will promote beta cell longevity and health by increasing the expression of beta cell identity while reduc-
ing ER stress; this feature is expected to enable CR to mitigate the loss of beta cell identity and function observed
in aging human beta cells. Understanding how beta cells adapt to changes in metabolic demands and/or ER
stress to maintain their long-term function and health can lead to new ways to promote and/or preserve beta cell
function in aging patients as well as in those living with T2D."
10762453,"Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) cause millions of deaths each year and they are refractory to treatment.
Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Rhizopus oryzae cause life-
threatening invasive candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and murormycosis,
respectively. Patients at the greatest risk of developing these IFDs have weakened immune systems such as
HIV positive individuals. The vulnerable population is increasing due to increasing numbers of
immunosuppressed individuals receiving stem cell or organ transplants. In the U.S. medical costs for these
three IFDs exceed $5 billion dollar per year. An infected individual’s medical cost often exceed $100,000.
Patients are treated with various antifungal drugs, but all antifungals have serious limitations due to human
organ toxicity, the lack of sufficient fungicidal effect at safe doses and safely limited treatment periods, and the
emergence of resistant fungi. Even with treatment, one-year survival is only 1% to 90%, depending upon the
patient population. Few new drugs have gained acceptance in the last 20 years. We created a transformative
technology in which almost any antifungal drug may be delivered specifically to the fungal cell wall and/or their
secreted exopolysaccharide matrices to increase drug efficacy by orders of magnitude. This technology and
the conceptual framework supporting it meet the critical need for dramatically improved antifungal therapeutics.
 We have employed the carbohydrate recognition domains of the C-type lectin receptors Dectin-1 and
Dectin-2 to target liposomal packaged antifungals to fungal glucans and mannans. Antifungals such as
Amphotericin B packaged in liposome penetrate the endothelium, have longer half-lives and less infusion
toxicity than detergent solubilized drugs. We have remarkably strong in vitro data showing that Dectin-1- and/or
Dectin-2-targeting of Amphotericin B-loaded liposomes improved binding efficiency to these four diverse fungal
species 100-fold over untargeted liposomes and killed three species 10- to 100-times more efficiently. The
deliverables of this high-risk high-reward proposal include (1) demonstrating that Dectin-3 in combination the
other Dectins expands fungal cell targeting capabilities, (2) generalizing the technology to the delivery of other
antifungals agents such as fluconazole and anidulafungin, and (3) assembling a preclinical data package
showing that targeted antifungal-loaded liposomes have increased efficacy in mouse models of invasive
candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and pulmonary mucormycosis. We believe we
will create a paradigm shift in the antifungal pharmaceutical industry.
 We have an established team of scientists already combining their expertise in diverse areas of science
necessary to carry out these experiments. We have developed an experimental platform to rapidly innovate
and reiteratively test fungal cell specific targeting of antifungals that may be used to treat diverse life-
threatening fungal infections and milder fungal infections of eyes, skin, toenails, and biomedical devices."

 The overarching goal of this study is to identify new mechanisms that preserve neuronal function with age.
As the world's aging population steadily increases, the number of diagnoses for neurodegenerative disease
and dementia is projected to more than double within the next 30 years, underscoring our immediate need to
understand the cellular and molecular basis of brain aging. Atrophy of the connections that mediate neuronal
communication leads to aberrant activity within neural circuits in the aging brain. How changes in activity
modify the properties of aging neurons is not yet clear. The brain adapts to neuronal activity in part via the
induction of new gene expression programs encoding critical cell-type-specific mediators of circuit plasticity.
Whether re-engaging the regulators of these gene programs in aging brains can ameliorate declining neuronal
function remains unknown.
 The bHLH-PAS transcription factor NPAS4 constitutes a major regulator of activity-dependent gene
programs in both mice and humans. NPAS4 integrates into the NuA4/TIP60 acetyltransferase protein complex,
a transcriptional co-activator and DNA repair complex, which has been linked to learning and memory in
invertebrates. Intriguingly, activity-dependent elements targeted by NPAS4 transiently acquire a chromatin
mark of DNA damage signaling upon neuronal activation (γH2AX), raising the possibility that NPAS4 may
function at these sites to help repair damage resulting from activity-driven transcription. In preliminary data, I
discovered that Npas4 knockout mice die prematurely with signs of cell stress in the hippocampus. This study
will examine the hypothesis that the newly identified NPAS4:NuA4 complex has evolved a protective role to
promote the sustained functionality of neurons by maintaining transcriptional control and genome stability at
activity-dependent gene loci. I will examine age-dependent changes to Npas4 regulation and activity-
dependent gene induction across neuronal cell types (Aim 1, K99) and identify critical gene targets of this
complex in activated neurons (Aim 2, K99). During the R00 phase, I will expand upon these ideas to explore a
novel role for this activity-dependent protein complex in the repair of directed DNA damage at enhancers and
promoters, and will examine how this directed DNA repair activity changes with age (Aim 3, K99). In the long
term, I will leverage the datasets, and new skills in bioinformatics and neurobiology acquired during the K99
training period, to identify new mechanisms and molecules that preserve cell-type-specific function in the
nervous system. My ultimate goal is to design targeted strategies to slow or reverse decline in the neuronal
subtypes most susceptible to age-dependent diseases."
10763044,"Delirium is a common and significant cognitive complication after major surgery in older people. The etiological
heterogeneity of delirium and luck of its underlying pathophysiology hampers advances in prevention and
treatment. Systemic and CNS inflammation have gained greater attention as components of the
pathophysiology underlying delirium. Systemic inflammation induces neuroinflammation – largely regulated by
brain resident immune cells such as microglia, and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and brain-infiltrating
monocytes – resulting in acute cognitive dysfunction. Recent studies reported age-dependent heterogeneous
microglial molecular phenotypes linked to mouse models of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
These findings highlight microglia-mediated neuroinflammation as a potential age-related pathophysiological
mechanism underlying delirium. Another line of research underscores the importance of microglia in the control
of extracellular glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in normal cognition and delirium. Microglia play essential
roles in the glutamate/glutamine cycle and are key regulators of glutamate release and clearance under
neuroinflammation. Exaggerated release of glutamate by activated microglia leads to excitotoxicity and neural
damage. Glutaminase is the primary enzyme for glutamate synthesis, contributing to synaptic glutamate
release and glial production of glutamate. 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine analog that acts as a
glutaminase inhibitor and blocks glutamate release from activated microglia, has shown pro-cognitive efficacy
in various disease models of neuroinflammation. We have recently developed orally available prodrugs of DON
(JHU-083), designed to improve CNS penetration. Notably, JHU-083 effectively delivers DON to the brain and
JHU-083 inhibits stress-induced microglial glutaminase activity and cytokine induction, normalizing stress-
induced behaviors. Hence, we hypothesize that upregulation of microglial glutaminase activity may contribute
to age-related postoperative cognitive impairments, and inhibition of glutaminase by JHU-083 may reverse
abdominal surgery-induced microglia activation, which may alleviate postoperative cognitive impairments. In
this study, we will identify age and gender-dependent postoperative cognitive impairments. We will determine
age and gender-dependent postoperative alterations in the microglial transcriptome landscape and co-
regulated molecular environment of glutaminase and inflammatory genes. We will also determine whether
microglia activation is required for age-dependent postoperative neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments.
Finally, we will determine whether JHU-083 ameliorates age-dependent postoperative cognitive impairments
and normalizes glutaminase activity, microglia activation, and neuroinflammation. Our study will reveal age-
related microglial inflammatory vulnerability to abdominal surgery that underlies the pathophysiology of
postoperative cognitive impairments. Our findings will also provide evidence that glutaminase in microglia is a
potential drug target for postoperative cognitive impairments associated with delirium in the elderly."

In the US alone, more than 11 million family caregivers provide care for someone with Alzheimer's
disease or other dementia on a daily basis.1 These family caregivers have been estimated to
shoulder 70% of the total cost of care over their care recipient’s lifetime, costs which include
medical bills and unpaid caregiving hours.2 Caregiving-related stress contributes to social
isolation, loneliness, and physical illness and increases the risk of caregiver death.3-7 Currently,
most caregiver interventions focus on reducing burden, stress, and negative emotions. However,
a growing body of research from our team and others demonstrates that positive emotion is
uniquely associated with beneficial health outcomes, independent of the effects of negative
emotion,8-12 and holds promise for countering the negative psychological and physical health
effects of caregiving. We developed and tested a facilitator-delivered positive emotion regulation
intervention for dementia caregivers that showed significant improvements in positive emotion,
positive aspects of caregiving, depression, and anxiety compared to an emotion reporting waitlist
control.13 However, the expense of facilitator delivery poses challenges to the implementation,
dissemination, and commercialization of LEAF. Online self-guided programs are more easily
disseminated, however, they generally lack a social connection which, given the high rates of
loneliness and social isolation among dementia caregivers,14,15 is problematic. In phase I of this
program of research (R43AG065080; Yang and Moskowitz, MPI), we tailored a self-guided online
positive emotion regulation intervention (called SAGE LEAF - Social Augmentation of self-Guided
Electronic delivery of the Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers) by incorporating social
connection components for caregivers going through the program individually (vs in groups; See
Phase I progress report). Interviews and focus groups with caregivers indicated a desire for SAGE
LEAF to host interactions within cohorts of caregivers participating at the same time. A proof-of-
concept study indicated that the SAGE LEAF prototype was feasible and acceptable. Caregivers
rated the social enhancements as moderately usable and suggested ways to make the features
more visible on the user dashboard. In the proposed Phase II project, we will further develop
SAGE LEAF to include features to foster implementation by clinics, care centers, and other
caregiver-serving organizations (CSOs) for groups of caregivers to leverage the benefits of social
connections within the virtual SAGE LEAF environment and will conduct a pragmatic trial in which
SAGE LEAF is implemented through the CSOs."

Orlance has developed a next-generation Gene Gun (MACH-1 GG) that efficiently delivers DNA and RNA into
epidermal cells, leading to robust immune responses. Sequencing of tumors from individual patients has led to
the identification of personalized neoantigens that could be targeted with cancer vaccines. However,
technologies that can effectively deliver these cancer neoantigens and promote the induction of localized tumor
specific T cell responses are still needed. Nucleic acid (NA; DNA and RNA) vaccines administered using specific
formulations or delivery technologies that achieve intracellular delivery offer considerable promise to achieve
this goal. These include electroporation (EP) or jet injection for IM delivery of DNA or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
for IM delivery of RNA. These delivery modalities, however, have different drawbacks including a requirement
for high doses (1-5 mg of DNA), ultra-cold storage due to limited stability (RNA/LNPs), reactogenicity or pain
post-administration, and a limited ability to target immune responses to specific tissues. The GG entails the
delivery of room temperature stable lyophilized DNA or RNA vaccines on gold microparticles. It achieves painless
and direct intracellular delivery into skin cells with very low doses (1-4 µg) that results in systemic, mucosal and
localized skin immune responses that could provide a benefit for treatment of cancers and, in particular,
melanoma. The MACH-1 GG is based on a previous successful GG that induced strong antibody and T cell
responses in phase I human clinical trials. The MACH-1 provides significant improvements over this earlier
device. Here, we will investigate the feasibility of using MACH-1 to deliver DNA or RNA cancer vaccines in mice
and test the hypothesis that MACH-1 will offer advantages in immunogenicity and efficacy over other DNA/RNA
delivery technologies for melanoma. We will first determine if co-delivering a novel set of genetic adjuvants will
increase the ability of MACH-1 DNA and RNA vaccines to induce melanoma-specific T cell responses. Next, we
will determine if combining DNA and RNA in the same dose or in a prime-boost regimen offers synergistic effects.
We will then compare MACH-1 delivery of DNA and/or RNA melanoma vaccines to DNA delivery by EP or RNA
delivery by LNPs for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. This work will be accomplished in two Aims:
Aim 1: Investigate the impact of genetic adjuvants on the immunogenicity and efficacy of GG delivered DNA and
RNA melanoma vaccines. Aim 2: Determine if combining the optimized adjuvanted DNA and RNA vaccines in
the same dose or in a prime-boost regimen enhances immunogenicity and efficacy compared to EP delivery of
DNA and LNP delivery of RNA in a mouse model of melanoma. Successful completion of these Aims will
establish MACH-1 as an effective device to deliver cancer vaccines."

 Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector of viruses that cause Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, and
dengue, the most widespread and significant arboviral disease in the world. Female mosquitoes differ from
males in morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits that facilitate reproduction and the transmission of
pathogens. Thousands of putative long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes were recently identified in the A.
aegypti genome, including a number that reside in the sex-determining M/m locus region. Few of these
lncRNA genes, once considered dark matter, have been functionally validated or characterized. This study
examines the hypothesis that M/m locus region lncRNA genes function in a sex-specific manner in adult
females. The aims of this study include: (1) completion of an RNAi-based large-scale screen to identify
lncRNAs that are required for adult female behavior or viability and (2) characterization of the function of these
genes through manipulation of gene expression in adult females. Pursuit of these aims will involve the
development of novel technology for sugar-baited delivery of yeast that enables manipulation of lncRNA
transcript levels. This research program, the first study to functionally characterize lncRNAs in adult
mosquitoes, will promote the elucidation of new gene targets for mosquito control and the development of new
methods to manipulate the expression of these genes. The strategies employed in this investigation, which
could be applied to the study of other lncRNAs, vector insect species, and biological processes of vector
importance, will help promote a paradigm shift that may result in the functional validation of many lncRNA
genes in insects of medical importance."
10910154,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Goals can change over time, and it is important to adapt our actions according to our current goals. There is
extensive evidence that long-term drug use can lead to dysfunction of neural circuits involved in goal-directed
decision-making. However, decision-making impairments are not always apparent in drug users, possibly
because drug-induced malfunction in certain brain areas involved in decision-making causes compensation in
which the brain reorganizes and/or different strategies are used to maintain adequate decision-making. This
proposal will examine changes in behavioral strategy and alterations in neuronal processing that maintain
adequate decision-making when the brain areas that normally support decision-making malfunction due to
prior voluntary methamphetamine intake or targeted disruption. The proposed studies will assess rats in a
devaluation task in which specific responses and cues predict rewards, and then the value of one of the
rewards is decreased. Flexible decision-making that is goal-directed would lead to a decrease in responses for
the reward with decreased value. Importantly, in our task, the action that leads to the devalued reward is
signaled by a response on a lever in a particular spatial location and with a particular light cue above the lever,
although normal rats guide their behavior based on the lever-location. However, decreasing the function of
prelimbic cortex (usually required to associate a response in a particular location with a specific reward) does
not impair the ability to decrease responses on the lever-light compound associated with that reward. Prior
research from our lab suggests that animals compensate for the loss of ability to associate the lever-location
with the reward (due to prelimbic cortex lesions) by instead associating the cuelight above the lever with the
reward, a type of learning that is supported by orbitofrontal cortex. These prelimbic cortex lesions are
associated with an increase in neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex and in neuronal activity in mediodorsal
thalamus neurons projecting to orbitofrontal cortex during learning. As prior research suggests that
psychostimulant exposure can lead to alterations in the function of prelimbic cortex and/or lateral orbitofrontal
cortex, I will determine long-term effects of prior methamphetamine self-administration on the neural circuits
underlying devaluation and whether compensation between brain areas can preserve intact devaluation
behavior. In addition, as prior research suggests that voluntary drug-taking causes different neurobiological
and behavioral changes than being passively exposed to drugs, I will compare effects of passive
methamphetamine exposure to those of voluntary drug-taking. The proposed research is relevant to one
component of NIDA’s mission, to “develop new and improved treatments to help people with substance use
disorders achieve and maintain a meaningful and sustained recovery”. Our findings may help to understand
how drug users may maintain adequate decision-making after drug-induced brain dysfunction, and may identify
alternative behavioral strategies that could improve this decision-making after past drug use."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Title: Novel Epigenetic Test for the Treatment and Improvement of Longitudinal Health-Outcomes for
Men with Severe Infertility
 39.7 million men worldwide (1% of the male population) suffer the severest form of male
infertility: Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA). These men have no identifiable sperm in their semen,
greatly limiting their chances of having children of their own. In addition to the heartbreak of infertility, these
men have been found to have much higher risks for many long-term health conditions including cancers,
metabolic diseases, and neuropsychiatric conditions. The lack of sperm is usually their earliest indication
of potential chronic and somatic concerns. Men presenting with NOA, according to the American Society of
Reproductive Medicine, should always be screened for genetic conditions (including Klinefelter’s Syndrome
and Y-chromosome microdeletions) and be directed to further genetic counseling if any are discovered.
 There is essentially one path that can be taken for patients with NOA to retrieve sperm cells: testicular
biopsy procedures. Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) is the most common testicular biopsy
procedure and is performed by cutting open the testicles and identifying areas in the seminiferous tubules with
possible pockets of sperm production. Sperm then can be removed from the tubules and used for fertilization
of an egg. mTESE is extremely invasive and expensive (~$12,000 out of pocket) and only has a 40-50%
success rate of finding any sperm.
 To give these men the best options for conceiving and long term health management, the
Jenkins and Hill Laboratories at Brigham Young University (BYU), in collaboration with Inherent Biosciences
(Inherent), are developing a new, single comprehensive diagnostic test that 1) predicts the success of mTESE
with extreme accuracy to guide treatment of sperm retrieval and subsequent conception, 2) more accurately
identifies the subtypes of all Y-chromosome microdeletions (which is an important prognostic indicator), and 3)
identifies Klinefelter’s Syndrome. Termed NOA-guideTM, this diagnostic test will be available for use by all
NOA men (1% of the male population). NOA-guide will determine the presence (or absence) of
sperm-derived cfDNA in a semen sample to determine if sperm retrieval from the testicle is a viable
fertility treatment option for men diagnosed with NOA and will identify certain genetic abnormalities
causative of NOA.
 All Aims and Tasks described in this proposal are based on solid preliminary data from both the Jenkins
and Hill laboratories. Additionally, the plan for commercialization and NOA-guide success are founded in
detailed financial models and market launch plans developed by Inherent Biosciences - a company ideally
situated to execute all aspects of this study. With the support of this NIH SBIR Fast-Track grant,
NOA-guide will provide physicians and patients with unprecedented insight into the chances of mTESE
success and the genetic abnormalities that may be causing NOA. Also, patients not suitable for mTESE
will avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and significant out-of-pocket expenses."

Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes the AIDS-defining cancer Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS).
The KSHV-infected KS tumor cells (KSCs) express proliferation markers, indicating a loss of contact inhibition
of proliferation (CIP). CIP is considered a tumor suppressive pathway, and loss of CIP is a crucial feature of
oncogenic transformation in solid tumors. How KSHV antagonizes CIP is not known. The KS tumor cells most
likely originate from microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). While LECs therefore represent a
relevant model for studies of KS, KSHV-induced proliferation after de novo infection of primary human LECs
has not been demonstrated. We have developed a protocol for KSHV infection of primary human LECs that
allows us to measure KSHV-induced loss of CIP. The central hypothesis underlying this application is that
KSHV-induced loss of CIP is a critical driving feature of oncogenesis in KS. Our preliminary work shows that
the KSHV miR-K10 miRNAs contribute substantially to the KSHV-induced loss of CIP in LECs but are not the
only viral determinants of this phenotype. Our results furthermore implicate viral repression of p27, disruption
of adherens junctions (AJs), and deregulation of the cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking in KSHV-mediated
loss of CIP. To test our hypothesis and elucidate the mechanisms underlying KSHV-induced loss of CIP, we
propose three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the expression of the four miR-K10 miRNAs
in KSHV-infected LECs and KS. We will also define their individual contributions to the KSHV-induced loss of
CIP. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify the mechanisms underlying the miR-K10-induced loss of CIP in KSHV-
infected LECs. In Specific Aim 3, we will identify other viral genes that promote the KSHV-induced loss of CIP.
The proposed study is innovative because our model provides rigorously defined experimental settings that
enable the analysis of KSHV-induced loss of CIP after infection of a primary human cell type with relevance to
KS. This work is significant because it will establish the viral determinants of KSHV-induced LEC proliferation,
thereby explaining oncogenic mechanisms in KS. Results will be impactful since CIP is a tumor-suppressive
mechanism. Understanding how KSHV overcomes CIP will help us to explain how KSHV causes KS and could
potentially be exploited for therapeutic intervention in KS."

The faithful segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is a fundamental and important process, happening
approximately a quadrillion time throughout a human life span. Errors in mitosis have severe implications and
are often detrimental to development, health and survival of the organism. Microtubules are the main building
blocks of mitotic spindles and are a very important target for cancer therapy. We know that microtubules, in
particular kinetochore microtubules, exert forces on chromosomes to initially position them on the metaphase
plate and consequently divide them to the two daughter cells. However, recent research has shown that the
central spindle also plays an important role in chromosome segregation. The precise mechanisms of how the
central spindle regulates chromosome segregation are not fully understood today. A line of evidence has
suggested that the central spindle can generate outward pushing forces to move chromosomes, but it has also
been convincingly shown to slow chromosome segregation down by acting like a break. The goal of this
proposal is to dissect the function of the central spindle during anaphase and to identify how the central spindle
generates forces contributing to the segregation of chromosomes. We further aim to establish the contribution
of microtubule dynamics for central spindle function. To achieve this goal, we use the microstructural data
from tomography in wild type and mutant conditions to monitor the microtubule arrangement and properties in
the central spindle during anaphase and to identify potential interactions and force generating mechanisms.
We will complement the precise structural data with dynamic data on microtubules in the midzone obtained by
cutting edge light-microscopic analysis. We will use mathematical modeling to develop and test hypothesis of
how the spindle midzone contributes to chromosome segregation in anaphase. The ultimate goal of our study
is to understand how the central spindle generates forces that regulate the segregation of chromosomes and to
identify the molecular key players of this process"

Life expectancy for people living with HIV (PWH) has increased substantially in the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
era. Consequently, the Medicare program is anticipating a “silver tsunami” of PWH aging into program. There
are substantial concerns about how HIV will affect treatment decisions, quality of care, and clinical outcomes of
older PWH with age-associated multimorbidity, like Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD),
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mental illness. Despite these concerns, we currently lack a national,
comprehensive understanding of how quality and outcomes have changed for PWH over time, or the key
patient, drug plan, market, community, and policy factors that influence care. Quality of care concerns are
especially salient among historically marginalized populations that experience worse care quality at baseline,
including racial and ethnic minorities, rural populations, and low-income adults dual-eligible for Medicaid and
Medicare. A national strategy aimed at improving quality for older adults in the Medicare program is expansion
of alternative payment models (APMs), including Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), in which a group of
healthcare providers take responsibility for assigned patients’ total costs and quality of care, and Bundled
Payment Models (BPMs), which encourage cost reductions following admissions for specific clinical episodes.
Although APMs have achieved modest savings and improvements in quality for Medicare beneficiaries
generally, there is no empirical data evaluating whether APMs are effective for PWH. There are concerns that
the quality and cost benchmarks in these models may lead clinicians in APMs to avoid high-risk patients like
PWH, or when serving PWH, to limit necessary care due to aggressive cost-containment efforts. As the federal
government expands APMs, it is critical that we understand the impact of APMs on the health of PWH. In this
study, we will use national, longitudinal data (2005 to 2025) to pursue three aims. Aim 1 will evaluate changes
in the quality of care and health outcomes among PWH compared to a matched population without HIV, and it
will also identify the patient-, plan-, market-, clinician specialty-, and community-level factors associated with
better quality, equity, and improved outcomes. Aim 2 will use a quasi-experimental study design to determine
the impact of Medicare ACOs, the largest Medicare APM, on the quality of care and health outcomes of PWH.
Finally, Aim 3 will determine whether Medicare BPMs, the second largest APM, improve or worsen quality and
outcomes for PWH. Findings from this study will offer a national perspective on the key factors, including the
Part D Drug Benefit design, on quality of care and health outcomes of PWH following age-eligibility for
Medicare. We also propose the first national study to evaluate the impact of APMs on PWH. Our work will
inform national clinical, public health and policy efforts aimed at improving quality and health outcomes of PWH
in the Medicare program, including consideration of specific policy modifications for PWH under APMs."

Unlike many organs that undergo age-related degeneration, the prostate gland undergoes age-
related enlargement leading to significant health complications in the majority of men over 60
years old. Increasing evidence indicates a central role for prostate stem/progenitor cells and
abnormal activation of prostate regeneration pathways leading to prostate enlargement.
Current treatment approaches for prostatic enlargement primarily revolve around therapies
targeting the androgen receptor (AR), which can partially alleviate symptoms but do not achieve
permanent disease remission. Our laboratory recently determined that the important stem cell
factor SOX2 is an important stem/progenitor and survival factor during prostate development
and regeneration. SOX2 is a transcription factor that is essential for maintaining survival and
pluripotency of embryonic and many adult stem cells, and canonically interacts with OCT4 to
promote stem cell gene expression and repress differentiation. This proposal builds upon
our work demonstrating an important and novel non-stem cell and prostate-specific
function for SOX2 in the prostate, whereby SOX2 promotes resistance to AR-targeted
therapies and expansion of stem/progenitor cells to promote prostate enlargement.
However, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanistic role of SOX2 in
prostate enlargement; filling such knowledge gaps has a high potential to functionally implicate
SOX2 and SOX2-target genes as new therapeutic targets to prevent and treat age-related
prostate enlargement. The long-term goal of this project is to identify signaling pathways
regulated by SOX2 in prostate epithelial cells that can be targeted to prevent and therapeutically
treat prostate enlargement. The objective is to define how SOX2 promotes the survival of
multipotent prostate epithelial cells and contributes to prostate stem cell expansion glandular
enlargement and begin testing novel strategies to deplete prostate progenitor cell populations.
Our central hypothesis is that the quantity of SOX2-positive prostate cells increases during
aging, and SOX2 enables resistance to AR-targeted therapies, thereby promoting prostate
enlargement."

10765216,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Responses of cells to signaling perturbations exhibit complex dynamics that vary
across diverse cell types or even genetically identical cells exposed to uniform conditions. Heterogeneity arises
partly because of the cells’ ability to process the signaling input in the context of their states controlled by their
epigenome, a regulatory network involving transcription factors and chromatin architecture which, although
contains heritable information about gene expression programs, remains plastic. Such plasticity enables cells
to transition from one phenotype to another and exhibit fractional responses to perturbations. Despite this
knowledge, what remains largely unknown is: (i) the nature of these dynamically fluctuating phenotypically
consequential cell states, and how they determine the context for signal transduction, (ii) mechanisms that
control the diversity of these states, their multi-stability or plasticity, and variation across cell types, and (iii)
mechanisms by which information embedded in these states is integrated with that from signaling input to elicit
state-specific decisions. Our proposed research is significant because it addresses these key gaps in our
understanding through the study of AP-1 transcription factor network, which we recently showed to serve as a
key node in linking MAPK signal transduction to diverse patterns of cell state plasticity. Individual cells can
adopt a variety of AP-1 states regulated by a combination of competitive homo- and heterodimeric interactions
between individual AP-1 proteins, whose levels and stability are also subject to transcriptional (auto)regulation
and posttranslational modification by MAP kinases. We have shown that the diversity of recurrent AP-1 states
and their single-cell frequencies vary across differentiation states and predict their phenotypic plasticity prior to
and following MAPK perturbations. We propose to determine how combinatorial patterns of AP-1 network
shape cell state heterogeneity and plasticity via analyzing a panel of model-guided, AP-1 perturbed, isogenic
cells to decompose the impact of diverse AP-1 dimers on chromatin features, networks of transcriptional
coregulators, the resulting gene expression programs, and single-cell responses to MAPK perturbations. We
will build the first generation of experimentally validated models of AP-1 regulated expression system based on
their dimerization-controlled, co-regulated, competitive interactions, and use them to reveal network features
underlying the diversity of multi-stable AP-1 states in different cell populations. Side-by-side virtual and wet-lab
single-cell experiments will uncover pharmacologically tractable targets to modulate population heterogeneity
via stabilizing or destabilizing certain AP-1 states. We will use multiplexed single-cell imaging in combination
with multivariate modeling to determine how the trajectory of adaptive responses to MAPK perturbations and
their phenotypic outcomes are determined through the integration of treatment-induced changes in the AP-1
network. Understanding these fundamental mechanisms will lead to novel strategies to manipulate cell state
plasticity and new opportunities to improve precision medicine via guiding cells toward the desired phenotypes."

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are responsible for seasonal flu and pose a pandemic threat. The overarching goal
of our research is to understand the structural and biophysical mechanisms at the molecular level by which
nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of IAVs interferes with host antiviral responses. NS1 is a major virulence factor of
IAVs, counteracting host antiviral immune responses. Remarkably, NS1 has a multifaceted strategy to interfere
with many host proteins involved in viral RNA (vRNA) sensing and degradation, apoptosis, and interferon
production. Furthermore, NS1 is one of the most frequently mutating proteins in the IAV genome. Therefore,
studying the evolution of NS1 and its role in immune evasion and modulation is essential for understanding the
strain-specific virulence of IAVs. However, to understand the evolutionary development of NS1’s strain-specific
functions, it is necessary to examine the interactions between newly acquired mutations and other residues
within NS1, which are known as epistatic interactions. Addressing the molecular mechanisms of epistasis is a
major challenge in the fields of protein science and evolution. Over the next five years, we will investigate how
NS1 interferes with host immune responses in a strain-specific manner. In this proposed research, we will
address the questions of how epistatic interactions contribute to the strain-specific interactions between NS1
and host proteins, and how NS1 employs its RNA-binding ability to antagonize vRNA sensors that initiate
innate immune responses. To accomplish our goal, we will use an integrated approach including X-ray
crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (EM), NMR and fluorescence spectroscopies, chemical crosslinking
using amber-codon suppression, molecular dynamics simulation, and cell-based experiments to parallel our
structural and biophysical studies. This research will provide a mechanistic framework for a quantitative
understanding of NS1's strain-specific immune evasion functions. As a result, this study is expected to have a
positive impact on the development of antiviral agents targeting NS1-host protein interactions."

The Calvi lab investigates the regulation of cell cycle and genome integrity using Drosophila melanogaster as a
model system. Our ongoing studies are defining the variations in cell cycle and checkpoints in development
and how these variations are related to disease. One cell cycle variant that we have focused on is called the
endocycle, which is a G / S cycle without division that results in large, polyploid cells. The endocycle is a
normal variant growth program in a variety of tissues and organisms including humans. In recent years, it has
become increasingly clear that mitotically dividing cells can also switch to polyploid endocycles in response to
conditional inputs. We call these induced endocycling cells (iECs) to distinguish them from the developmental
endocycling cells (devECs) that contribute to the growth of specific tissues during development. While iECs
can be beneficial for tissue regeneration, they also can contribute to tissue malformations and cancer. We had
previously shown that both devECs and iECs repress the p53 apoptotic response to DNA damage, and that
iECs in both Drosophila and human cell culture can return to an error prone mitosis that compromises genome
integrity. Our evidence, together with that from other labs and the clinic, has led to a prevailing model that the
survival and division of cancer iECs contributes to cancer therapy resistance and relapse. Nevertheless, much
remains unknown about the mechanisms that regulate iEC cycling, growth, and checkpoint responses and
what global impact these properties have on tissue malformations and tumorigenesis. We are continuing to
address these questions using Drosophila as a model system to study iECs in vivo. This has led to a
fundamentally new viewpoint that iECs are not just a switch in cell cycle, but also represent a distinct cell state
with modified growth, stress response, and signaling pathways that have both cell autonomous and
nonautonomous effects on tissue growth. We are using integrated cell, molecular and genomic approach to
further define this cell state and uncover new mechanisms by which it affects tissue growth and oncogenesis.
As part of this inquiry, we continue to define how proapoptotic p53 target genes are repressed in endocycling
cells to discover conserved mechanisms that couple apoptotic competence to cell cycle programs. These
ongoing studies into the p53 pathway have led us to discover that different Drosophila p53 protein isoforms
have overlapping and distinct functions in multiple cell types and processes. We are investigating how these
p53 functions are regulated by its localization to subnuclear bodies, a process that is conserved with human
p53. Altogether, it is anticipated that the outcomes of our investigations will uncover new cellular and molecular
mechanisms that regulate growth and stress response, which will ultimately lead to the better diagnosis and
treatment of developmental malformations and cancer."
10765303,"Description: RNA-guided, or ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP), enzymes comprise an emerging class of
molecules that function in a wide range of biological pathways. Unlike most of the protein-based enzymes,
RNP enzymes rely on the guide RNA to secure the substrates and on the partner proteins to catalyze
the chemical reactions. The RNA-guided targeting mechanism has created unprecedented opportunities
in genome manipulation, gene regulation and nucleic acid detection. Research in the Li laboratory
employs structural biology and complementary methods to uncover the theoretical basis for their
biological function and effective use as research, diagnostic and therapeutic tools. In the proposed
funding period, the Li laboratory will tackle the mechanisms of the RNP enzymes to enable their
applications. These include the methylation-sensitive Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short
Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, the multi-functional Type III CRISPR effectors and their associated
signaling processes, and the small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) responsible for chemical modifications of
ribosomal RNA. Though unrelated in enzyme composition or biological pathway, these RNP enzymes
are governed by a similar set of physicochemical principles and share the great potential in therapeutic
and diagnostic innovations by reprogramming the chemistry of cellular nucleic acids. The proposed
research will assess the feasibility of engineering and applying the epigenetic DNA-specific Cas9, the
utility of rapid virus detection with the CRISPR Type III effectors, and the possibility of tunning cellular
functions through chemical modifications of RNA. The Li laboratory has assembled a team of scientists
with complementary expertise in microbiology, mammalian genome biology, yeast genetics, single
molecule biophysics, virology, virus detection, X-ray crystallography, and high-throughput cryogenic
electron microscopy to maximize the impact while mitigating the risks of the research. The goal of this
transformative proposal is to demonstrate and enable the applicability of the RNA-mediated enzymes in
a wide range of biomedical fields.

10765372,"Project Summary. Rapid evolution lies at the core of some of the greatest challenges humanity faces today,
ranging from the evolution of drug and antibiotic resistance to the rapid emergence of new Covid variants.
Researchers are now envisioning even faster evolutionary dynamics brought about by CRISPR gene drives.
This fascinating new technology could be used to directly suppress wild populations, or to rapidly spread an
engineered allele through a population, for example a gene that reduces pathogen transmission in mosquitoes.
Unfortunately, current population genetic models are not well-suited to describing such rapid processes,
because they are often still grounded in simplistic assumptions such as a homogeneous, randomly mating
population. Research in my lab centers on the development of new population genetic models and
computational tools for studying rapid evolutionary processes such as CRISPR gene drives that allow us to
better predict their expected outcomes. Over the past five years, my lab has developed a comprehensive
modeling framework for gene drive dynamics. Here, we propose to incorporate increasing levels of biological
realism into this framework to address three broad questions: (1) How can we systematically identify the
features and parameters that are most critical for determining the outcome of a drive release in our
simulations? (2) Is it possible to reliably confine a gene drive to an intended target population, and how could
this be achieved? (3) Could a suppression drive in a mosquito population eradicate diseases such as malaria
or dengue even when it does not achieve complete suppression of the mosquito vector? As gene drive
technology comes ever closer to field experimentation, answers to these questions will be essential for a
realistic evaluation of the expected outcomes of a drive release into a wild population. Motivated by insights
from our modeling work on gene drives, we propose a second line of research focusing on the question of how
continuous space can affect the dynamics of other rapid evolutionary processes, such as strong selective
sweeps, which conceptually resemble the spread of a gene drive in many ways. We hypothesize that similar to
what we found for gene drives, continuous spatial structure could also have a profound impact on the
population dynamics of strong selective sweeps, and thus the signatures they leave in population genomic
data. We plan to study this question using forward genetic simulations together with recently developed
methods for inferring sweep parameters based on supervised machine learning. Finally, we plan to implement
critical improvements in our SLiM evolutionary simulation framework, enabling forward simulation of
populations of billions of individuals, so that we can predict the outcomes of the release of a CRISPR gene
drive into a mosquito population with sufficient accuracy and robustness to facilitate a well-informed discussion
about the feasibility, reliability, and risks of such approaches."
10765486,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cell signaling is initiated at the plasma membrane (PM), but our understanding of the chemical interactions that
regulate membrane protein function is still incomplete. The overall theme of my research group is to resolve
functional, molecular interactions in the complex environment of the PM. These efforts produce fundamental
insights into structure-function relationships of cell surface receptors and provide a crucial link between structural
biology and cell signaling. My work is aimed at the two largest families of membrane proteins: receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Both of these protein families are heavily targeted in
disease. GPCRs are the targets of over 30% of all FDA approved drugs. RTK inhibitors are the most successful
targeted therapies in cancer treatment. RTK function is coupled to dimerization, but the degree of
heterodimerization between receptors has not been investigated in a systematic way with a quantitative, live cell
methodology. Our objective is to quantify these interactions in live cells and determine the effects of ligands and
the plasma membrane environment. Chemokine receptors are class A GPCRs that regulate cell movement like
migration and infiltration in a broad range of cell types. Consequently, they are important in diseases ranging
from asthma and arthritis to psoriasis and cancer. CXCR4, for example, is the target of an FDA approved
compound for mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells in cancer. Many studies have demonstrated that chemokine
receptors can assemble into homodimers and heterodimers that regulate cell signaling and can be targeted in
drug development. These dimerization interactions are non-covalent and thus dynamic in nature, although the
precise thermodynamic and kinetic principles governing the interactions are not yet resolved. Furthermore, the
prevalence and stability of putative dimeric complexes has only been well characterized for a small number of
receptors, leaving open many questions about the importance of dimerization for other chemokine receptors. My
lab will use an innovative approach called pulsed interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation
spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) to resolve and quantify membrane protein interactions in live cells. Our future research
plans are to: (1) Investigate how ligand binding and cellular environment affect the local network of RTK
interactions, (2) Resolve the role of heteromerization on chemokine receptor GPCRs, and (3) Develop a 3-color-
PIE-FCCS instrument to resolve competition in the local interaction network of membrane proteins in live cells.
The outcomes of this work will be a quantitative description of membrane protein interaction networks, which will
provide fundamental insight into cell signaling pathways involving these receptors. This insight will in turn create
new opportunities for drug development and translational research."
10765499,"Rational drug design and understanding of how mutations cause disease are largely based on the hypothesis
that a protein's sequence determines its structure, which determines its function. However, designing drugs and
interpreting new variants remain difficult, suggesting there is a missing factor in this sequence-structure-function
paradigm. There is good reason to believe that a sequence-ensemble-function paradigm that better accounts for
the fact that proteins are not rigid bodies, but are dynamic entities that are endlessly hopping through a set of
different structures (called an ensemble) would be far more powerful. However, realizing this potential has been
slow because it is even harder to get an atomically-detailed picture of an entire ensemble than a single protein
structure. The PI and his lab have been developing tools that combine atomically-detailed computer simulations,
biophysical experiments, and machine learning to overcome this challenge. They have made significant progress
on relatively small proteins with limited dynamics, enabling a deeper understanding of how mutations modulate
function and the design of new drug-like molecules for controlling function. The objective of this work is to test
the applicability of these tools to much larger and more complicated proteins that are of significant importance
in both fundamental biology and drug design, myosin motors. Myosins are responsible for a broad range of
biological functions, from muscle contraction to hearing. As a result, they are important targets for treating
diseases ranging from heart failure to parasitic infections. To function, myosins must undergo a complex series
of structural changes. The PI and his lab will test whether their tools for accounting for these extensive dynamics
enable more accurate predictions of sequence-function relationships and the rational design of new drug-like
molecules for controlling motor function. They will focus on β-cardiac myosin because of its importance in heart
disease and the myosin 1 family of motors because its members have highly diverse biological functions but it
remains unclear how mutations tune the motor's behavior for all these different purposes. The lab will design
new myosin variants and allosteric modulators as a stringent test of their insights. Success will enable future
myosin drug discovery and application of these tools to other proteins."

Our research program involves the use of DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) and DNA-linked enzyme
activity probes, which are new approaches for biomedical research that capitalize on the power of DNA analysis
techniques. Specifically, this work involves development of in vitro selection assays for both DELs and enzyme
activity probes. It is the in vitro selection that encodes transduces information (drug molecule activity or
biochemical activity of a sample) into DNA sequences to facilitate analysis. This work advances these techniques
into new areas, particularly for medicinal chemistry applications, to provide tools for biological discovery and
development of new therapeutics.
 We are using DELs in a directed, targeted way (on-DNA medicinal chemistry) to produce inhibitors to the
chromodomains in the CBX family and to several bromodomains. The homology of the chromodomains in the
eight chromobox (CBX) proteins and of the family of bromodomains (61 in humans) makes selective inhibition
challenging. Inhibitor probes generated will be used to the decipher roles of these proteins in transcriptional
regulation and in disease states. DELs are now routinely used for de novo discovery of compounds that bind to
a drug target to initiate a drug development campaign. The selection assay used for this discovery is a simple
affinity purification with a purified protein on a solid support. The requirement of a pure and active protein for this
assay severely limits the target scope of DELs, particularly for membrane bound protein targets, which constitute
a large portion of drug target space. We are developing selection assays to enable use of DELs to protein targets
both on and within live cells. These assays rely on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), which
is a common modality for detection of interacting molecules in cells. We will apply these unique assays with
highly diverse (>109), commercially available DELs to challenging protein targets including Nrf2 (potential cancer
target) and adenylyl cyclase 1 (a potential target for pain). In addition, we are developing selection assays to
identify molecules that not only bind to a protein receptor but activate downstream signaling pathways. We are
applying this selection to the opioid family of GPCRs to identify novel agonists.
 We will advance to use DNA-linked enzyme activity probes for the proteomic profiling of tyrosine kinase
activities and for drug binding assays amenable to high throughput screening of traditional (off-DNA) compound
collections. We are implementing our DNA-based kinase activity profiling to further understand the mechanism
of drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy. Also, the high sensitivity of the approach
(enabled by DNA amplification) will be used to assay kinase activities in single cells, which will provide a greater
understanding of cellular complexity within tumors."

Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have presented an enormous burden to public health and
economy with increasing prevalence. T2DM is characterized by relative insulin deficiency caused by pancreas
β cells dysfunction and insulin resistance in metabolic organs. The liver plays a central role in regulating systemic
glucose and lipid homeostasis. Aberrant hepatic insulin action is believed to be a primary driver of insulin
resistance, in which insulin fails to adequately suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP), while enhances
lipogenesis and triglyceride secretion, a phenomenon referred to as selective insulin resistance. Although
downstream signaling cascades mediating insulin's control of glucose and lipid metabolism have been
extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance and its
differential effect on glucose and lipid metabolism are not well understood. We previously have identified critical
functions of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3), a phospholipid (PL) remodeling enzyme, in lipid
metabolism in liver. Loss of Lpcat3 selectively reduces polyunsaturated PL in membranes, leading to decreased
membrane fluidity and curvature. Changes in membrane dynamics result in impaired SREBP-1c processing and
lipogenesis, and reduced triglyceride secretion in liver. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the roles of
hepatic Lpcat3 and PL composition in insulin signaling and systemic lipid and glucose metabolism, and their
contribution to the development of insulin resistance. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which PL
composition regulates insulin sensitivity. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether dysregulation of Lpcat3 expression
mediates selective insulin resistance in T2DM. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting Lpcat3
for hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in T2DM. The results of this work will advance our understanding of
how membrane composition modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in liver, and how changes in
membrane biophysical properties contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance."

The long-term research program in the Xiao lab focuses on structural and biochemical studies of innate immune
signaling, particularly the inflammasome pathways. Activation of inflammasomes may lead to the maturation and
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18, as well as pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory
form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD) and other gasdermin family members downstream of
diverse signaling pathways implicated in infections and autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders. As such,
understanding the mechanisms of gasdermin regulation is highly significant. Despite recent progress on the
identification of gasdermins as effectors of pyroptosis, and on the mechanisms of GSDMD activation by
inflammatory caspases, contributed by the Xiao lab and others, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of gasdermin function remain incompletely understood. In particular, gasdermin processing by
different caspases and other proteases that may activate or suppress pyroptosis remain understudied. Even
though protease processing, an irreversible form of post-translational modification (PTM), is the most intensively
studied mechanisms of gasdermin regulation, emerging evidence suggests that gasdermins are regulated by
several other PTMs such as ubiquitination and Cys modifications. The regulation of gasdermins by host and
microbial proteases, ubiquitin ligases, and palmitoyltransferases remain key knowledge gaps that have
hampered mechanistic understanding of pyroptosis regulation under physiological and pathological conditions.
This proposal is based on emerging evidence from the rapidly evolving field of gasdermin biology that serve as
strong scientific premise and rationale. The proposed studies leverage our expertise in structural and
biochemical studies of gasdermin activation by inflammatory caspases, and target critical gaps in our
understanding of gasdermin regulation using complementary structure-function approaches. We hypothesize
that post-translational modifications of gasdermins by host and microbial enzymes, such as proteases,
ubiquitin ligases, palmitoyltransferases, and other enzymes, regulate their function in pyroptosis. Better
understanding of how gasdermins are regulated will not only furnish new insights into pyroptosis modulation, but
also stimulate the development of novel therapeutics that target gasdermins and pyroptosis. Overall, this
proposal builds upon the PI’s past research program that enables the long-term pursuit of the mechanisms for
gasdermin regulation on a scale that is broadly compatible with the MIRA mechanism."

 Transition metal- and enzyme-catalyzed reactions of alkenes are among the most powerful approaches to
synthesize functionalized organic compounds for biomedical research. Recent experimental advancements have
enabled promising catalytic methods for various alkene functionalization reactions with different mechanistic
features and distinct types of bond formations. However, it remains a significant challenge to effectively control
regio- and stereoselectivity in reactions with readily available, unactivated alkenes. Due to the lack of theoretical
understanding of reaction mechanisms and origins of catalyst effects on reactivity and selectivity, experimental
developments of new catalytic reactions often rely on trial-and-error screening. A general strategy to investigate
catalytic reaction mechanisms and to utilize mechanistic information to guide catalyst discovery is warranted.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and apply computational tools to obtain mechanistic insights
and predictive models to guide experimental development of catalytic functionalizations of alkenes. We will use
a series of computational tools, including density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations, to model reaction pathways and identify rate- and selectivity-determining transition states. We will
utilize energy decomposition analysis (EDA) calculations to analyze covalent and non-covalent interactions
between catalyst and substrate and provide quantitative and straightforward prediction of dominant catalyst–
substrate interactions that control reactivity and selectivity. We will apply these computational tools to investigate
mechanistically complex catalytic systems, including reactions involving conformationally flexible catalysts,
solvent cage effects in radical-mediated reactions, and cooperative effects in multicomponent reactions. We will
use computational tools to perform detailed studies of new-to-nature reactions catalyzed by engineered enzymes.
These studies will reveal the mechanisms of enantioinduction and the roles of key active site residues on
reactivity and selectivity.
 The proposed research program is significant and innovative because it aims to address general challenges
in computational studies of a broad range of catalytic reactions, rather than to simply explain existing results for
specific experimental systems. Our studies will establish computational approaches to investigate complex, yet
important phenomena in catalysis, including the roles of non-covalent interactions, solvent, and catalyst flexibility.
These mechanistic insights can provide new principles and strategies in rational catalyst design to improve
reactivity, selectivity, and substrate scope. Our research is highly unique in collaborating with many prominent
experimental groups. These fruitful collaborations allowed us to progress in not only the understanding of many
specific examples of alkene functionalization reactions, but also the development of general rules of regio- and
stereoselectivity in these processes."

Gene therapy is a promising treatment for many diseases. For gene therapy to become increasingly successful,
three hurdles must be overcome: We need viral vectors that are (1) safe, (2) efficient, and (3) cell type specific.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a viral vector that is safe in humans, efficient at delivering
transgenes to both dividing and arrested cells, and able to drive long-term expression. Unfortunately, the broad
tropism of AAV is detrimental when gene delivery to specific cells (e.g., cancer) is paramount and ectopic
expression in healthy cells or tissues poses a risk to the patient’s safety.
We recently reported a working prototype of a novel configurable viral gene delivery technology. This technology
consists of a capsid that we genetically engineer to express an adapter domain to which we covalently attach
monoclonal antibodies to form antibody-AAV composites. AAV tropism is redirected toward the antibody’s
cognate receptor, which is expressed on a targeted cell type, but not off-target cell populations.
Here, we will take the next critical steps to build on this prototype and broaden the impact of our technology. We
will improve composite-AAV formation efficiency and infectivity (Aim 1), comprehensively map additional
engineerable capacity across AAV serotypes identify new capsid engineering strategies and enable machine-
learning guided AAV design (Aim 2) and, as a proof of concept, determine target specificity and spread of AAV
composites in vivo (Aim 3).
The outcome of this work will be a validated viral vector platform technology that uses antibodies to target gene
delivery to rationally identified cell types. This technology will enable fundamentally new gene therapy paradigms
and, in the longer term, lead to new therapeutic approaches for inherited disorders and cancer."

Recurring outbreaks emphasize an urgent need for significant public health improvements. This research investigates the mechanisms underlying pathogen transmission and identifies epidemiological units, across which transmission occurs, and measure their vulnerability to outbreaks. Outputs will be developed with and for mobile health teams in the DRC and will provide a generalizable blueprint for the broader application of this approach across a range of contexts. The proposed research targets the intersection of theoretical frameworks to examine four interlinked topics. First, following Cutter in 2003, this project will develop formal spatial methods to identify and delineate epidemiological units of pathogen transmission and measure their epidemiological vulnerability. Vulnerability is determined by the mechanisms underlying locally specific transmission processes, which differ across diseases. This work includes health data quality as a problem that allow public health problems to persist where they most need improvement. Second, building on Kwan’s 2013 work, this research will start with R1’s epidemiological units and vulnerability indices and integrate the dynamics of seasonal and long-term population mobility, connectivity, and distribution. Population dynamics drive contacts, transmission, and spread for communicable pathogens and must be included in vaccinations and outbreak response. Third, extending Shuurman’s 2011 work, this research will visually represent these dynamic epidemiological units and vulnerability indices cartographically to advance methods in geovisualizations and provide usable spatial decision support systems (SDSS) for mobile health efforts. To maximize clarity and usability, these visualizations will be rigorously developed and tested with our collaborating humanitarian organization’s field teams and graduate students in infectious diseases and geography. Fourth, this work will develop dynamic quantitative models to produce formal comparisons of intervention strategies and iteratively improve them. Models will compare A) strategies using the proposed SDSS, which highlight acting on the vulnerability of epidemiological units of transmission before outbreaks occur for immunizations and outbreak responses and B) the current system, which is guided by administrative boundaries and case rate thresholds to trigger response. Linking spatial and temporal elements of human-environment interactions to support infectious disease prevention and outbreak management will significantly advance the current methods and theory in this field."

This proposal will fund the NHLBI CVD Epi Training Program in Behavior, the Environment, and
Global Health, critically important scientific disciplines that remain under-represented in NHLBI
training. This Program will train 2 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees each year in the rich
academic environment of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and affiliated institutions
locally and worldwide, bringing together outstanding faculty mentors to provide integrated and
interdisciplinary experiences and collaborative interactions, specialized curriculum with core and
elective coursework, nondidactic practical career training, individual candidate training plans, and
ongoing Program evaluation. Cutting-edge didactic training and mentoring will create a new
generation of highly skilled and enthusiastic investigators to study the impact of behavioral and
environmental risk factors on cardiometabolic health; to elucidate the cultural norms and biologic and
sociologic pathways that modify these risk factors; and to understand and utilize the full set of
epidemiologic, interventional, environmental, and policy tools to design, implement, and evaluate the
most effective individualized, community, and policy interventions to reduce impact of harmful risk
factors, facilitate expansion of protective behavioral and environmental factors, and attenuate or
reverse the alarming global trends in cardiometabolic health. Training will include modern
methodological and analytical techniques required to study the intersections of cardiometabolic health
with Behavior, including observational epidemiology and interventions across the life cycle; the
Environment, including airborne and environmental toxins, social risks, and physical (built)
environment; and Global Health, including observational epidemiology and controlled interventions at
individual, community and healthy system levels. This Training Program adds considerable strength
and depth to the NHLBI’s commitment to understanding the behavioral and environmental
determinants, preventive measures, and treatments of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in both
developed and developing nations."
10783748,"Project Summary:
Understanding the mechanisms of protein and organelle function and dysfunction in disease
requires a detailed and dynamic analysis of molecular structures and interactions in live cells.
The long-term goal of my laboratory is to develop tools that reveal these functional elements
and apply them to discover significant biology and/or design molecules with useful properties. I
am drawn to difficult, complex, multi-disciplinary problems where chemistry can catalyze
exciting and non-incremental progress. We strive not simply to develop tools, but also to apply
them in innovative ways to acquire new and influential knowledge. This rubric leads us naturally
into diverse and emerging scientific areas. Fluorescence spectroscopy features prominently in
the three research programs described herein. In two, a fluorescent tool we developed (section
A) or innovated (section C) has already identified influential new biology; here future work
capitalizes on this knowledge with an eye to translation. In the third, tool development is on-
going (section B) but progress-to-date provides a clear roadmap for very exciting future
applications."
10878897,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
For patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), replacement of the ascending aorta with a current standard
of care prosthetic graft (polyethylene terephthalate) eliminates risk for dissection in graft-replaced regions and
can thus be lifesaving. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence reveals that proximal aortic grafting can increase
risk for downstream dissection, which is also life-threatening: Risk is greatest in patients with genetically triggered
TAA, who undergo graft replacement at lower thresholds, higher frequency, and younger age - after which risk
for dissection in graft-replaced regions is eliminated but possibility of distal complications increases. Up to two
thirds of dissections in genetic TAA patients occur in the distal (arch or descending) aorta. We have also shown
that over half of distal dissections with genetic TAA occur after graft surgery; proximal grafting has been linked
to a >2-fold increase in risk for dissection independent of aortic size. Our clinical observations are consistent
with experimental data: In pre-clinical and computational models, the dramatic increase in proximal aortic stiff-
ness with grafting induces hemodynamic changes that exacerbate distal stiffening. Aortic stiffness is increased
with genetic TAA - it is also known that mechanical loading forces drive adverse aortic remodeling. There is thus
a critical need to identify markers of distal aortic disease progression after proximal grafting, with focus on altered
hemodynamic loading in relation to graft characteristics (stiffness, length, enclosed volume). Our central hypoth-
esis is that loss of proximal aortic compliance due to stiff prosthetic grafts induces adverse distal aortic remod-
eling (driven by increased wall and wall shear stress) and predicts adverse prognosis. We also posit that adoption
of grafts, for which compliance is tailored to compensate for patient-specific aortic stiffness, will attenuate ad-
verse distal aortic remodeling. This will be tested in genetic TAA patients undergoing prosthetic graft replace-
ment, via Aims integrated towards the goal of testing if graft implantation produces progressive increments in
adverse remodeling (Aim 1A), identifying (native aortic and graft) features most responsible for adverse remod-
eling (1B), testing if these features are modifiable via a new class of tailored grafts (Aim 2), and exploring if widely
generalizable surrogates of graft-induced remodeling and native aortic stiffness predict clinical events (Aim 3).
To do so, cardiac MRI will be integrated with computational modeling of fluid structure interactions and vascular
remodeling - informed by material property testing of resected aortic tissue and simulations of tailored grafts for
which compliance can be paired to patient-specific aortic features. Our team provides complementary expertise
in cardiac imaging, aortic surgery, genetic TAA, computational modeling, and graft design - and a track record
of productive collaboration. Results will yield key foundational insights as to mechanisms of adverse remodeling
and events after grafting, transform risk stratification for current grafts and inform personalized therapy by guiding
design and prototyping of a new class of tailored grafts - towards the goal of improved outcomes for TAA patients
who benefit from proximal grafting but remain at risk for serious clinical events in the residual native aorta."
10753223,"The PI, Joseph Kopke, is a PT and Ph.D., trained at Northwestern University after serving in the US Air Force
for 8 years. His dissertation research focused on understanding control of the shoulder and the feasibility of
using machine learning to control a powered device to support the shoulder against gravity after stroke. His
immediate goal is to develop a hybrid exoskeletal system utilizing a passive shoulder and an active hand
(Shoulder-Hand Acitve-Passive Exoskeleton, SHAPE) to assist individuals after stroke. He would like to advance
this project towards a follow-on efficacy study as part of a CDA-2. Ultimately, his goal is to bridge the gap between
the clinic, neuroscience, engineering, and the patient and bring simple, smart, intuitive devices to Veterans to
address impairments and increase function after neuro insult.
He is supported by a strong and experienced team of mentors including Dr’s Matthew Major (Ph.D.), Levi
Hargrove (Ph.D.), Elliott Roth (MD), Stefania Fatone (Ph.D., BPO) and poised between three top-tier institutions
Jesse Brown VAMC, Northwestern University, and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. His mentorship team offers him a
breadth and depth of knowledge and experience essential to the success of his proposal. His primary mentor,
Dr. Major will provide oversight of the project and Dr. Kopke’s training and development; Dr. Hargrove provides
the expertise in pattern recognition and imbedded control while Dr Roth provides over 30 years experience as a
clinician scientist working with individuals with stroke and other neurological impairment; Dr. Fatone will offer
insight and guidance as a trained orthotist with years of upper-extremity device development experience.
Together they offer Dr. Kopke the opportunity to develop towards an independent VA movement scientist
committed to bettering the function and quality of life of Veterans through orthotic technology.
This proposal focuses on the development of the Shoulder-Hand Active-Passive Exoskeleton (SHAPE) for
individuals with chronic upper-extremity impairment after stroke. Common impairments after a cerebrovascular
accident, or stroke, include extreme weakness throughout the shoulder, arm, wrist, and hand, limiting their use.
Additionally, increased abnormal tone that presents during effortful tasks further impairs the individual by causing
unintentional and abnormal muscle activation throughout the limb. Supporting the shoulder to move the arm
against gravity minimizes this abnormal tone and enables better elbow, wrist, and hand function. Combining
shoulder support with a hand device designed to facilitate extension and grip will then address both the weakness
experienced in these areas as well as minimize secondary negative effects caused by use of the shoulder.
The purpose of Aim 1 is to design and refine a wearable passive shoulder support device to help compensate
for gravity. A prototype to passively support glenohumeral elevation has already been designed and fabricated
using low-cost materials. An iterative phase-gate approach incorporating user feedback will be implemented to
advance this design from prototype to a more definitive device that is comfortable and effective. Functionality
will be assessed in a small number of participants with and without the shoulder portion of SHAPE through
measuring shoulder range of motion, Fugl-Myer upper-extremity assessment, and the box and blocks test.
The purpose of Aim 2 is to develop a functional pattern recognition controller for a wearable hand device assisting
gross hand -opening and –closing. Control of the open-source Hand Extension Robot Orthoses (HERO) grip
glove, a powered orthosis to support hand function, will be advanced. Decoded movement intentions from a real-
time and online pattern recognition myoelectric controller will be incorporated into the control scheme. User
functionality will be assessed with and without the hand portion of SHAPE through measuring hand range of
motion, Fugl-Myer upper-extremity assessment, and the box and blocks test.
The same measures will then be assessed using both aspects of SHAPE simultaneously to detect possible
additional improvements. It is hoped SHAPE can improve function and quality of life for Veterans with stroke."

 Picornavirus infections are a leading cause of viral encephalitis and myocarditis in humans. These viral
infections can cause substantial inflammatory changes in the brain and heart and lead to significant morbidity
and mortality. The immune system detects picornavirus infections, and other single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)
viruses, via DEAD/H-box (DDX) helicases that sense cytosolic viral ssRNA and initiate the protective interferon
(IFN) response. Two DDX helicases critical in this process are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and
melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Both RIG-I and MDA5 are members of the RIG-I-like
receptor (RLR) family of RNA-sensing helicases. RIG-I is known to sense negative-sense ssRNA (–ssRNA)
viruses (e.g., Sendai virus or vesicular stomatitis virus), while MDA5 is the major sensor for RNA from
picornaviruses and other positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA) viruses including SARS-CoV2 and other
coronaviruses. How MDA5 is activated and regulated is currently not well known, which is in striking contrast to
RIG-I for which the activating mechanisms have been elucidated in detail.
 To study the pathogenesis of myocarditis and encephalitis, researchers have used a prototypical
member of the picornavirus family, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Using EMCV, we demonstrated an
important role for the A disintegrin and metalloproteinase protein (ADAM9) in viral pathogenesis. We
discovered that mice lacking ADAM9 rapidly succumb to EMCV infection without mounting the characteristic
IFN response seen in wild-type mice. Our data indicate a novel role for ADAM9 in viral RNA-induced IFN
production through the DDX helicase MDA5.
 In EMCV infection, MDA5 is the sensor that recognizes viral RNA and initiates a signaling cascade that
leads to activation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) pathway and subsequent IFN production.
IFN production is triggered when the viral genome interacts with nucleic acid sensors in the host cell to activate
downstream pathways. The host IFN response is crucial to protect the host by limiting virus replication. We
hypothesize that ADAM9’s role in viral-induced IFN production is mediated through the MDA5-MAVS pathway.
 The role of ADAM9 in regulating the IFN response to diverse RNA viruses, including picornaviruses and
coronaviruses, will be defined in terms of its effects on the ability of MDA5 to interact with viral RNA and its
effect on protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications of MAVS pathway adapters and
effector proteins. Through these experiments, we will define new pathways of IFN activation and better define
the pathogenesis of RNA viruses in an animal model system for studying encephalitis and myocarditis."
10894812,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Millions of women worldwide have undergone mastectomy and breast reconstruction procedures. Simple (also
called total) mastectomy, the most common mastectomy procedure for women with breast cancer, amputates
all of the breast tissue, including the third through sixth intercostal nerves, leaving the breast numb. Loss of
sensation is a distressing symptom (affecting more than 60%) that leads to major adverse effects, including
elevated risk of injury, disembodiment (a feeling that the breasts no longer are part of one's body), loss of touch-
based affective communication (e.g., the feel of an embrace), and loss of erogenous sensation. Mastectomy
also often results in chronic neuropathic pain (25-60%), a costly and burdensome condition that standard
interventions cannot reliably alleviate. Our solution, the Bionic Breast Device (BBD), combines a neural
stimulation approach (successfully deployed to restore touch in bionic hands and feet in limb amputees) with a
novel tissue-like stretchable sensor that detects pressure applied to the nipple-areolar complex. The BBD will
trigger stimulation of intercostal nerves, evoking a sensation experienced on the otherwise insensate breast. The
objective of the present Phase 0 trial is to characterize, for the first time, the sensory consequences of electrically
activating the intercostal nerves that innervate the breast in women who have recently undergone a mastectomy.
In this study, we will implant cuff electrodes on intercostal nerves T3 and T4 in women during their mastectomy
procedure. Participants will all be women undergoing bilateral mastectomy with two stage alloplastic (implant)
reconstruction for early breast cancer (unilateral in situ or T1N0, <2cm) or breast cancer risk reduction. Following
a 4-6 week recovery period after mastectomy with electrode implantation, participants will undergo twice-weekly
psychophysical testing sessions during which electrical stimulation will be applied to the nerves through the
electrodes via percutaneous leads. Participants will have the electrodes and percutaneous leads removed during
their planned second stage reconstructive surgery 12-20 weeks after mastectomy. The specific aims of this
research are to: (1) Establish the parameters of electrical stimulation of the intercostal nerves that evoke
perceptible and distinguishable sensations and characterize the projected fields on the body; (2) Characterize
the features of the sensations evoked via activation of the intercostal nerves, including their quality and perceived
naturalness; and (3) Gauge the short (during implantation) and longer-term (6 months following explantation)
impact of intermittent electrical stimulation of the intercostal nerves on post-mastectomy pain. This trial will
establish that touch sensation can be restored to the breast via neural stimulation. Data will also be obtained to
inform future feasibility (including safety), efficacy, and acceptability trials. The Bionic Breast Project proposes
enormous benefit at relatively low cost and risk and thus has the potential to be truly transformative."
10754521,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The major obstacle to an 'HIV cure' is the persistence of viral reservoirs (VR) harboring replication competent
viral genomes that have the capacity to produce infectious virus. These VR persist for long periods of time, and
even after years of suppressive ART, the systemic spread of virus resumes within a few weeks upon cessation
of ART in all but exceptional cases. Effective cure strategies will need to dramatically reduce or eliminate VR
through safe and scalable approaches. It is currently thought that the major VR are long-lived latently infected
resting memory CD4+ T cells, which remain quiescent until they are stimulated by external cues to produce virus.
In addition to the truly latent VR, emerging data shows that in individuals on suppressive ART a subset of VR
transcribe viral RNA (vRNA+) at variable levels (termed ‘active VR’). In some cases, this might lead to residual
levels of HIV replication, particularly in tissue microenvironments where drug concentrations are suboptimal.
Even without full viral replication, this residual expression of virus may have adverse consequences and
contribute to chronic immune activation/inflammation and non-AIDS defining clinical events. Eradicating HIV will
require targeting both the ‘latent’ and ‘active’ VR, however, our current understanding of HIV reservoirs comes
mostly from studies performed in peripheral blood, but the blood contains only a small fraction of VR during ART.
We reason that to maximize efficacy of ‘HIV cure’ strategies, we need to first better characterize both the tissue
compartments and the cellular subsets from which infection might rebound in HIV-infected individuals after ART
is interrupted. Thus, the overarching goals of this research proposal, in response to RFA-AI-18-053 “Single-Cell
Multi-Omics of HIV Persistence”, is to merge our innovative in situ hybridization (ISH) approaches to quantify
and map VR at high resolution with multiple new cutting-edge multi-omics platforms to investigate mechanisms
of VR persistence at the single-cell level while retaining critically important contextual insight into the cellular
immune neighborhoods and inflammatory landscapes in which VR reside. In Aim 1, we will utilize our suite of
novel next-generation ISH (RNAscope, DNAscope and BASEscope) platforms to quantify and generate “atlases”
of ‘latent’ and ‘active’ VR longitudinally within tissue compartments (peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes,
spleen, GI tract) before and at different timepoints during ART ± anti-inflammatory adjunctive therapy. In Aim 2,
we will perform an in-depth phenotypic analysis of VR and the cellular immune neighborhoods and inflammatory
landscapes in which they reside within tissues (guided by our high-resolution in situ VR mapping outlined above)
using Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) proteomic analysis as well as unbiased SNaPP and nanoPOTs mass
spectrometry approaches for spatiotemporal molecular analyses on samples obtained by LCM of immune
neighborhoods and single cells, as well as on dissociated FACS sorted single cells. In Aim 3, we will perform in
depth FISSEQ that combines the spatial context of RNA-FISH and the global transcriptome profiling of RNA-seq
on tissue sections (as outlined above) but retained at the single-cell level."
10754522,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Type 2 allergic immunity is a specialized subtype of immune response that limits multicellular helminths and
protozoa. However, recent work also implicates type 2 immunity in physiologic tissue remodeling, which in
excess can drive allergy, asthma, atopy, and tissue fibrosis. Type 2 immunity is coordinately driven by tissue
type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and type 2 CD4+ T helper cells (Th2s). Tissue-resident ILC2s and Th2s
have a high degree of transcriptional and functional similarity, secreting high levels of the cytokines IL-5 and IL-
13 to organize downstream immune and non-hematopoietic cells. Although diverse tissue signals regulate these
cells, it remains unclear how their broad localization (i.e. topography) within organs is controlled and how this
may impact immune pathology. In many tissues, ILC2s and Th2s localize to fibroblast-rich adventitial areas
around larger blood vessels and lung airways. Our preliminary data show that type 2 inflammation drives their
expansion into de novo parenchymal niches (e.g. near alveoli in lung, hepatocytes in liver). We find that ILC2s
require trafficking-associated pathways to expand into parenchymal niches, whereas type 1 lymphocytes (T1Ls)
are broadly distributed in tissues and produce IFNγ+ that confine ILC2s and Th2 subsets to adventitial niches. In
models of mixed type 1/type 2 inflammation, enforced ILC2s and Th2s in parenchymal sites inhibit effective T1L-
mediated responses leading to increased mortality. Our central hypothesis is that ILC2 and Th2 localization to
tissue parenchymal niches occurs via trafficking from blood pools and must be tightly controlled to balance
immune risks and benefits to organs. Aim 1 will define the mechanism(s) and impact of IFNγ repression of ILC2
and Th2 cell parenchymal distribution. We will test the hypothesis that IFNγ produced by T-cells restricts cell
trafficking into parenchymal niches during mixed inflammation. We will use genetic tools to eliminate IFNγ-
signaling on ILC2s and Th2 subsets and determine functional consequences in models of mixed inflammation.
Aim 2 will determine the routes and signals that control ILC2 and Th2 parenchymal localization. Here we will
test the hypothesis that type 2 immunity activates tissue type 2 lymphocyte expansion and ‘retrograde trafficking’,
with transitory residency in the blood allowing for tissue-specific re-entry in parenchymal sites and ultimate type
2 niche expansion. We will use multimodal approaches, including organ transplantation, photoconversion,
parabiosis, and cell transfers to determine the required trafficking molecules, kinetics, dwell time, and ultimate
fate in parenchymal sites. Aim 3 will define functional impacts and targets of ILC2 and Th2 parenchymal
localization. Here we will test how production of IL-13 and other signals target discrete tissue immune and stromal
subsets, potentially impairing effective type 1 immunity and leading to context-dependent beneficial or pathologic
outcomes. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide fundamental mechanistic data on how tissue
topography of ILC2s and Th2s impacts function, laying the groundwork for future diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches that can direct type 2 localization to impact beneficial and pathologic immune responses."

Impaired
Summary
CamIO (“Camera Input-Output”) is a project designed to make physical objects, including documents,
maps and 3D objects such as architectural models, fully accessible to people who are blind or visually
impaired. It makes these objects accessible by means of an audio-based Augmented Reality (AR)
interface: the user points to a specific location on an object of interest and hears audio information
about this location read aloud (or sees an enhanced image of the selected location if the user has low
vision). Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or
visually impaired, CamIO offers several advantages: (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing
objects (e.g., with braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a smartphone and
optional wearable camera device; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent braille
readers; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers to enable audio-haptic
interactions with the object.
 Building on our past work on the prototype CamIO iPhone app, we plan to develop powerful
enhancements and new functionality, including finger tracking as an alternative to the use of a pointing
stylus, and support for wearable options such as the camera-enabled Envision Glasses that will offer a
far superior user interface to what is possible with a stand-alone smartphone app. New authoring
capabilities will make it easy for blind and visually impaired users and sighted assistants to create audio
labels for objects. We will also pursue two exciting applications of CamIO in depth: using CamIO to
make tactile maps fully interactive and easier to understand, and the development of interactive
installations such as a 3D scale model of a large playground that helps visually impaired playground
visitors familiarize themselves with the playground’s layout and features. Finally, people who are blind
or visually impaired – the target users of the CamIO system – will be involved in all aspects of the
proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort."
10784760,"RESEARCH PLAN – Summary/Abstract
This project develops and applies methods to compare the overall personal well-being of different individuals using
answers to survey questions asking respondents to rate many aspects of well-being. Comparing well-being across
individuals and groups is a crucial input to many scientific endeavors: (1) using cross-sectional data to study the
determinants of well-being or to study changes in well-being over the life course, (2) studying inequality in well-being,
which in turn is necessary for aggregating personal well-being into a measure of social welfare, and (3) quantifying the
extent of group advantage or disadvantage when nonmarket goods are taken into account.
Two key issues arise in comparing overall personal well-being between individuals (or groups): first, different individuals
may use the reporting scale differently; second, being able to compare any pair of individuals A and B requires being able
to make an assessment of who has higher overall personal well-being when A has a higher level of some aspects of well-
being, but B has a higher level of other aspects of well-being.
Specific Aim 1 addresses scale-use differences: Develop and validate methods to compare the levels of self-reported
aspects of well-being, such as emotions, pain, and perceived capabilities in daily life, across individuals and across
groups in a way that adjusts for systematic differences in response styles and self-report biases.
Specific Aim 2 addresses the question of how to deal with comparisons when one individual has higher levels of some
aspects of well-being, while the other individual has higher levels of other aspects of well-being: Develop the theoretical
foundation for a new interpersonally-comparable well-being measure, consistent with the equivalence approach in
welfare theory, and adapted to use empirically with multidimensional subjective well-being measures (in
conjunction with the scale-use-correction methods in Specific Aim 1).
Specific Aim 3 involves data collection, empirical analysis, and theory to apply these methods to studying changes in
well-being over time and over the life course: To better understand the patterns of, and reasons for, the movement of
different aspects of well-being over the life course, collect two waves of highly multi-dimensional data on self-
reported aspects of well-being along with questions for scale-use correction (see Specific Aim 1), on a survey that
provides a rich trove of complementary data. Develop a theoretical framework for these measures in an economic
model of life-cycle behavior that includes a wide variety of activities, investment decisions, and life circumstances.
Apply the data in this framework to test new and existing theories about the determinants of well-being over the
life course, why existing research finds a mid-life trough in the levels of many aspects of well-being, and how to
distinguish permanent from transitory inequality in well-being."
10933540,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intersecting epidemics such as cardio-vascular conditions (e.g., hypertension), communicable diseases (e.g.,
COVID-19, HIV), metabolic conditions (e.g., diabetes), mental health and substance use disorders (e.g., co-
occurring alcohol use disorder and depression) have tested the limits of healthcare systems in historically
marginalized communities such as Latinx and migrant populations in the United States. The early detection and
severity of the above conditions in medically underserved communities are aggravated by systemic barriers to
primary care and detention. In this study, we proposed that providing legal services within primary care can
enhance healthcare delivery efficiency through addressing legal needs (such as barriers to health insurance,
medical treatments, housing safety, employment stability, and other legal needs) that can disrupt care to patients.
The proposed study, led by the SBU School of Social Welfare and SBU Center for Changing Systems of Power,
together with the GWU School of Public Health's Gill-Lebovic Center for Community Health in the Caribbean and
Latin America, the University of Puerto Rico's Social Determinants Center, the National Center for Medical Legal
Partnerships, UCF School of Medicine's Implementation Science Lab, and six federally qualified health centers;
will precisely examine the effects of legal services on primary care outcomes for medically underserved
communities. We will conduct a hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial with a cluster randomized design
in 6 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Orlando, FL, New York/Long Island, NY and San Juan, PR to
test a Critical-time Intervention Medical Legal Partnership (CTI-MLP) approach compared to the standard of
care. Three FQHCs will receive a CTI-MLP approach that includes provision of legal aid and capacity building
through team-facing legal support. The other three FQHCs will receive legal education and awareness, including
information about community-based legal organizations. Over a 12-month period, the team will collect (1)
patients' health and functioning, including overall physical health, mental health, social health, pain, fatigue, and
overall perceived quality of life; (2) data on legal needs and risk factors (3) longitudinal patient clinical outcomes
(N=960); and (4) FQHC staff (N=180) and clinic-level indicators, including provider-patient communication and
readiness for continued implementation and sustainability. We will assemble a Latinx and migrant community
advisory board and a scientific advisory board with medical-legal partnership expertise. Active engagement will
ensure the effective translation and dissemination of our findings into practice. With new Medicaid models
emerging that offer reimbursement for some social care provision, state officials can also use data to consider
expansion of Medicaid services to include the coordination and provision of social and legal services. Completion
of this project will result in an innovative, evidence-based intervention package to improve health outcomes for
highly vulnerable communities."
10765243,"MIRA Abstract
This MIRA renewal builds upon the success of our efforts to develop a readily accessible culture platform to
generate tissue-like structures and quantify cellular responses in physiologically relevant environments. Oxygen
is a master regulator of cellular function, responsible for systematic reprogramming under hypoxic conditions
and fine-tuning as oxygen supplies decrease. The tissue environment is spatially and temporally dynamic,
responding to changes in oxygen and nutrient supplies as well as localized and systemic gradients of cell-
generated signaling molecules. Despite the complexity of the tissue microenvironment, laboratories have relied
on monolayer cultures due to standardized procedures for setup and analysis. We recognized the need for a
culture platform to study cellular responses in defined tissue-like architectures whose extracellular
microenvironment could be engineered and quantified. The paper-based culture platform represents a readily
adoptable platform, which is modular in design and has a low technical barrier to entry. By stacking cell-laden
sheets of paper, tissues are generated on demand. Our continued efforts include technological advances and
the systematic study of oxygen's role in regulating (1) Estrogen signaling pathways in mammary tissue models.
(2) The post-differentiation of drug-metabolizing enzymes of hepatocytes in a sinusoid model. We showed that
hypoxia alters the regulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) in ER+ breast lines, decreasing transactivation
but maintaining similar amounts of protein in the presence and absence of estrogen. These results are markedly
different from monolayers of the same cells in hypoxia. As we continue to develop the mammary tissue model,
we will include stromal components to determine how they (alone and in concert with hypoxia) alter estrogen
signaling. Our goal is to use a multi-pronged approach to generate a map of the ""estrome,"" visualizing the
transcriptional, translational, and activity changes of ERa and ERb to better predict in vivo outcomes. Our
characterization of HepaRG cells under representative periportal and perivenous oxygen tensions shows its
importance in the post-differentiation expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport
proteins. We will continue to develop a sinusoid model that can characterize the HepaRG cells under a full range
of oxygen tensions that span the sinusoid in vivo, incorporating non-parenchymal cells known to provide
morphogens that promote this process and including flowing medium to simulate the constant exchange
occurring in the sinusoid. The previous funding period's biological inquiries and technological developments
enable these new directions. We will continue to incorporate commonly used analysis tools while developing
ways to characterize the system further while not straying from the original goal of a modular platform that is
both reproducible and quickly adopted. Our biological inquiries will result in more predictable cell-based
platforms, allowing for the: discovery of new biomarkers and treatments, the ability to confidently assess new
drugs for hepatotoxicity and potential drug-drug interactions, and a better understanding of disease progression."
10765555,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gene and chromatin regulation are at the core of many human biological processes such as development and
aging, and play an important role in disease, including during immune response and cancer progression. Much
work was done over the last few decades to catalogue transcription factors and chromatin regulators, determine
the gene regulatory elements where they act, and measure the chromatin states associated with them across
different cell types.
However, there are over a thousand transcription factors and chromatin regulators controlling gene expression
in human cells. Similarly, on the DNA side, there are tens of thousands of gene regulatory elements in the human
genome. Moreover, the function of these regulatory proteins (and hence of the DNA elements they bind to) can
change over time in response to signals such as cell differentiation or immune responses to viral infections.
These processes also show cell-to-cell heterogeneity that is important in cell-fate decisions. Consequently, our
efforts to understand the general principles of gene and chromatin regulation in human cells and the type of
dynamical responses they enable are severely limited by the fact that most experimental methods can only study
a handful of proteins at a time, generally use methods that average across cell populations, and often only
measure correlations at a given point in time.
In order to address these challenges, we combine high-throughput synthetic biology, single-cell measurements
of gene expression dynamics using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and mathematical modelling
for both a systematic and in-depth understanding. We use these tools to answer essential question about gene
and chromatin regulation in human cells: (1) How do transcription factors work: what are the biophysical rules
governing their effector domains and interactions with coactivators and corepressors, and what type of dynamic
responses do they enable? (2) How does the dynamics of gene silencing, activation and epigenetic memory
depend on the architecture of gene regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, terminators and
insulators? (3) What are strategies that viral proteins have evolved to interface with and perturb gene and
chromatin regulation in human cells in order to increase viral gene expression and disrupt immune responses?
Together, answering these questions quantitatively will help uncover the basic principles of gene regulation in
human cells in the context of a dynamic chromatin environment, will provide new tools for genetic, epigenetic
and cellular therapies, and will inform treatments of viral infections and immune disorders."

Bacillus cereus, a spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium, is a human pathogen commonly associated with
hospital infections and foodborne outbreaks. Increasingly, B. cereus has been identified as a cause of acute
severe infections and deaths in immunocompromised patients and children. One of B. cereus’ virulence factors
is the highly potent pore-forming toxin, hemolysin BL (HBL). However, the mechanisms underlying the
interactions between HBL and target cells and the identity of the HBL cellular receptor(s) remains unknown. This
knowledge gap presents significant challenges for developing effective therapies in clinical management of
potentially devastating B. cereus infections. Therefore, in order to develop effective therapeutics, there is a
critical need to identify the toxin cellular receptor(s) and the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxin’s action.
Our earlier preliminary data demonstrated that a cellular receptor is required for the cytolytic action of HBL.
Based on this observation, we performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screen and have identified
Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Factor (LITAF) as the major, heretofore elusive, HBL
receptor. Building on this strong preliminary data, in Aim 1, we will determine the in vivo role of LITAF in HBL
pathogenesis in mouse models. To do so, we will characterize the LITAF knockout mice we have generated in
this application, where our preliminary data supports the critical role of LITAF in HBL pathogenesis. We will also
generate LITAF transgenic mice allowing the restoration of LITAF expression in a cell type-specific manner in a
LITAF KO background. These cell type-specific LITAF-expressing mice will allow us to determine the key tissue
targets responsible for HBL-induced lethality. In Aim 2, we will establish whether LITAF is a species-independent
HBL receptor, perform comprehensive mutagenesis studies to identify the key residues of LITAF responsible for
HBL binding, and demonstrate the utility of decoy receptors as anti-HBL therapy.
Our initial CRISPR screen for HBL receptor demonstrated that CRISPR knockout of LITAF in mouse RAW264.7
macrophages resulted in complete resistance to HBL, whereas the same knockout in human HT1080 cells only
yielded a 4-fold increase in resistance. This suggests additional receptor(s) may be involved in HBL-mediated
cytotoxicity within certain cell types. Therefore, in Aim 3, we will delineate the full complement of host factors
required for HBL action via sequential CRISPR screens. Supported by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize
that this alternative receptor or additional host factors would become increasingly important when LITAF is
absent, and can therefore be identified by a CRISPR screen when LITAF knockout cells are used.
Together, this work will open new unbiased strategies for studying interactions between pore-forming toxins and
mammalian target cells, potentially elucidating common mechanisms used by other enteropathogenic bacteria.
These proposed studies will also validate the use of the unbiased stepwise CRISPR
factors hijacked by other toxins in modulating bacterial pathogenesis.

1 Introduction
More than any other phenomena in recent history, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged how
we approach patient-care due to the huge burden it has placed on hospitals, clinics, and health
professionals. The health community has responded to this trend with research and technology
leveraging data that goes beyond what is customarily thought of as “health data”, such as commu-
nity and contextual data, social media, traffic, and mobility data. For example, Nsoesie et al.[84]
analyzed hospital traffic and search engine data in Wuhan to infer early disease activity in Fall
2019. These new efforts, including our own work in utilizing mobility data to forecast COVID-
19’s transmission risk [94], uses what this NSF call-for-proposal refers to as “non-traditional health
data”.
In this proposal, we focus on one specific type of non-traditional health data, wearable data, which
are also fast becoming an important source of health and disease data as they inform on a variety
of personal, behavioral, social, contextual, and environmental health-relevant factors. Wearables
have been primarily used for activity tracking [96, 15, 20, 80] and gained popularity with fitness
applications; however, more recently, these devices have been used in an increasing number of
health applications, including health monitoring, clinical-care, remote clinical-trials, drug delivery,
and disease characterization to name a few. In fact, wearables have been found useful in a num-
ber of applications and diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and stroke [57], sleep disor-
ders [12], cardiac disorders [90, 63] and cancer [75]). This trend is accelerating with the COVID-19
epidemic, e.g., smartphones have been proposed to track symptoms [64], monitor effectiveness
of non-pharmaceutical interventions, assess potential spread, and support contact tracing [45].
Wearable measurements differ from traditional clinical measurements. When a patient visits a
clinic, vitals and lab tests are collected in a “controlled” environment in a short duration of time using
multiple devices. We define this monitoring in the controlled environment as Snapshot In-Clinic
monitoring, abbreviated as SIC. Meanwhile, the recent growth and accessibility of the wearable
devices such as smartphones and watches [97] with embedded activity and mobile sensors [114]
enables the continuous monitoring of patients’ vital signs and other health indicators over a long
duration of time. Patient monitoring using wearable devices typically happens in an “uncontrolled”
setup at home or at work in a non-intrusive fashion with only a few sensors. This trend has also
been encapsulated by the NIH mHealth’s initiatives, resulting in the evolution of new healthcare
models such as “home healthcare” [9, 40] and “minute clinic” [125], which goes hand in hand with
both ubiquitous sensors in smartphones and custom sensors like glucose monitors [62]. We define
this monitoring in the uncontrolled environment as Longitudinal In-Field monitoring, abbreviated
as LIFE. Clearly these are wordplay, i.e., SIC is for “sick” capturing patients’ state of mind when
they visit a clinic/hospital vs. LIFE for when patients live their normal “life” at home and at work.
LIFE monitoring makes up for greater than 99% of patients’ time, enabling outpatient monitoring
of the effects of disease and its therapy on patient performance and quality of life. In fact, our
preliminary data show that in some cases, such as assessment of performance status in cancer
patients, LIFE data outperform in-office SIC assessments [82].
SIC monitoring is the current standard of care and is driven by improving outcomes in measurable

A central goal of this P01 program project is the comprehensive interrogation of how cellular senescence affects
the gene expression, phenotype, and function of diverse cell populations in various tissues following infection or
vaccination. As traditional single-cell omics omits critical phenotypic and spatial information, the Single-Cell
Analysis core will provide with innovative approaches to accurately identify immune cell populations and their
functionality in their spatial context. This will be achieved by providing a consistent and validated pipeline of
multiple high-throughput omics approaches including, single-cell RNA sequencing, cellular indexing of
transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, cytometry by time of flight, spatial transcriptomics, and mass
imaging. Interpretation of these data and their integration between the individual Projects will require a consistent
experimental design and sample acquisition, as well as a significant effort of bioinformaticians with expertise in
the biology of aging, immunology, and single-cell analysis. The Specific Aims of the Single-cell Analysis Core
are: 1) Provide a quality-controlled platform and custom reagents for the single-cell and spatial genomics
assessment of senescent cells; 2) Provide bioinformatics and statistical analyses of single-cell and spatial omics
datasets; and 3) Develop a database to warehouse, integrate, and share datasets."
10780946,"The identification of prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of spinal cord injury (SCI) and SCI induced pain will
help to assign SCI patients to the correct treatment and rehabilitation regimes. Chronic neuropathic pain (NP) is
a complicated condition after a SCI that often has a lifelong and significant negative impact on life after the injury;
therefore, improved pain management is considered a significant and unmet need. NP mechanisms are hetero-
geneous and the difficulty in determining their individual contribution to specific pain types may contribute to poor
treatment outcomes in this population. The interruption of the spinothalamic pathway to the primary and secondary
sensory cortex or associated projections such as alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex and the medial and orbital
area of prefrontal cortex after SCI may result in permanent structural and functional reorganization of the brain and
spinal cord. Information about NP pathways is critical and can be used as quantitative complementary measures to
self-report qualitative pain assessments. Identifying quantitative human NP phenotypes based on multi-modal
neuroimaging and connectome measures that reflect specific spinal cord or brain mechanisms of NP is an im-
portant goal. Once a pain phenotype can be reliably replicated, its relationship with biomarkers and clinical
treatment outcomes can be analyzed, and thereby facilitate translational research and further the mechanistic
understanding of individual differences in the pain experience and in clinical trial outcomes. It also would aid in
appropriate recruitment of patients into clinical trials. The systematic characterization of structural and functional
alterations of the brain based on advanced neuroimaging techniques in people with NP following SCI has not yet
been established and development of this the long-term goal of our research agenda. Hence, the first aim of this
study is to develop multimodal brain structural and functional connectomes as well as an aggregate pain connectome
neuromatrix in uninjured control participants using advanced neuroimaging paradigms. The second aim of this study will
determine if connectomics phenotypes alter differently in SCI participants with little or mild (less than 3 on numerical
rating scale (NRS)) pain and SCI participants with moderate to severe NP. The identification of changes from the
normal connectivity of pain processing regions of the brain that underlie pain development has the potential to
uncover potential neural targets for future pain reducing therapies. As such, we aim to develop neuroimaging
biomarkers that may diagnose or predict the future development of SCI-induced pain; and finally in aim 3, we will
correlate quantitative structural-functional connectome pain neuromatrix in SCI patients with clinical pain measures.
A sub aim of this work is to unmask the relationship between allodynia, hyperalgesia and psychosocial aspects
of the pain experience after SCI. The progress regarding defining NP phenotypes may lead to more targeted
treatments such as pharmacological interventions and neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal
cord stimulation (SCS) and so on) approaches."
10932921,"SUMMARY
Dementing neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people and have an annual cost exceeding $380 billion
dollars in the USA alone. To gain insights into potential effective therapeutic strategies for these incurable
disorders, herein we focused our attention on the RNA-binding protein TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43),
whose altered subcellular distribution and role are thought to contribute to a number of dementing disorders
including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the clinical spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal
dementia (ALS/FTD). TDP-43, like other RNA-binding proteins with low-complexity domains are involved in the
formation of membrane-less organelles associated with RNA processing via liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS) assembly. While disease-associated mutations in TDP-43 can disrupt LLPS and its ensuing roles, how
wild-type TDP-43 subcellular distribution and function are altered in the majorly of AD and ALS/FTD cases, which
are gene mutation negative, remain enigmatic. We propose, herein, to investigate the role of post-transcriptional
regulatory mechanisms of TDP-43 mediated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A). This idea stems from our finding
that TARDBP, the gene encoding for TDP-43, is among the m6A targets in embryonic stem cell-derived motor
neurons (ES-MNs) and that its expression is under m6A epitranscriptomic regulation. Our central hypothesis is
that loss of m6A marks on TDP-43 causes changes in its expression and in its subcellular distribution and role,
which, in turn, may contribute to neurodegeneration. The rationale for this research is that, once it is known how
m6A-mediated regulation of TDP-43 contributes to neurodegeneration, innovative genetic or pharmacological
strategies can be devised for the treatment of these incurable human diseases. We propose to first (AIM 1)
characterize the spatiotemporal susceptibility of MNs to m6A loss. Accordingly, we will define the pattern of MN
loss in both spinal cord and brainstem in mice with Mettl3 depletion at both presymptomatic and symptomatic
stages using a battery of behavioral, physiological and morphological techniques. Then, since our preliminary
data show that TARDBP levels are increased when m6A is lost, in AIM 2, we will determine how the loss of m6A
impairs TDP-43 expression and its subcellular localization. Our preliminary data also show that m6A depletion in
ES-MNs results in reduced survival and neurite outgrowth. Thus, in AIM 3, we will provide a causal link between
m6A-dependent dysregulation of TDP-43 and neurodegeneration by using CRISPR-Cas-based site-specific m6A
editing of TDP-43 mRNA. Our work is expected to elucidate the role of m6A modification on TDP-43 subcellular
distribution and functions. Thus, our findings will have a positive impact by advancing our mechanistic
understanding of TDP-43 requirement for neuronal survival and by providing new targets for epitranscriptome-
modulating therapies for age-related TDP-43 proteinopathies."

More than half a million U.S.-born children currently live in Mexico. Research has largely
overlooked this important population of U.S. citizen children, particularly in comparison with
children of immigrants who remain in the United States. This study will provide a detailed socio-
demographic portrait of the large binational population of Mexican American children of
immigrants living in the United States and in Mexico. Mexican and U.S. census data from 2019-
2020 will be combined and analyzed to describe and compare the socioeconomic conditions
faced by children of Mexican immigrants born in Mexico who live in the United States and
children of Mexican immigrants born in the United States who live in Mexico. Socioeconomic
conditions include family and household structure, child’s enrollment in school, children’s access
to health care, and household economic resources. U.S.-born children in Mexico who are there
because they accompanied a deported parent will be identified using new questions on the
2020 Mexican Census about the parents’ reason for return to Mexico. The study will estimate
the extent to which U.S.-born children in Mexico are there due to de facto deportation and how
the socioeconomic conditions they face in Mexico compare to those faced by children at risk of
de facto deportation in the United States. The research will give scholars, policymakers, and
practitioners up-to-date, valid estimates of the size and characteristics of the large, binational
population of Mexican American children of immigrants living in Mexico and the United States."
10781511,"Project Summary:
Maternal obesity with increased circulating inflammatory markers can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such
as preeclampsia (PE). The clinical signs of PE include maternal hypertension and proteinuria during the second
half of gestation. While PE presents later in pregnancy, its origins are thought to begin early in pregnancy or
even before conception. Importantly, maternal hypertension only resolves after delivery of the placenta;
therefore, it is widely accepted that abnormal placentation plays a causal role in PE pathogenesis, though the
etiology of this is unknown. It is our hypothesis that maternal adiposity contributes to heightened inflammation
and subsequent abnormal placental vascular development. The overarching goal of these proposed studies is
to test the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory mediators produced by maternal adipose tissue (leptin) reduce pro-
angiogenic immune cells and factors at the maternal-fetal interface. We will test our hypothesis in the BPH/5
mouse model of PE combining novel in vivo and ex vivo experiments. In Aim 1, we will determine if
hyperleptinemia promotes decidual inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface in early pregnancy. Leptin-
STAT3 inflammatory mediators will be measured in control+leptin mice and BPH/5 mice that have
hyperleptinemia, which is attenuated with weight loss. In Aim 2, we will use single cell sequencing to isolate the
source of decidual inflammation in these pregnancies as well as placental angiogenic deficiency. In Aim 3,
offspring outcomes will be assessed to determine whether reversal of maternal obesity via pair-feeding prevents
aberrant fetal cardiac angiogenesis and adult onset cardiometabolic dysfunction. These experiments will
combine the gold standard radiotelemetric blood pressure recording with metabolic cages to ascertain
cardiometabolic fitness in offspring when maternal hyperleptinemia is blunted and PE is prevented. These
findings will provide groundbreaking prenatal mechanisms to prevent adult-onset cardiometabolic disease,
hypertension, in PE born offspring."
10771209,"PROJECT SUMMARY – SIMONICH/SEMPRINI PROJECT
Although remediation and detection research projects funded by the NIEHS Superfund Research Program
have saved >$100 million, recent studies by our laboratory and others have shown that the toxicity of PAH-
contaminated soils and sediments increases after biotic and abiotic remediation and that PAH primary
transformation products can account for only 23-28% of the increased toxicity. Polar secondary PAH
transformation products (e.g., epoxides, carbonyls, and ring-cleavage products) likely account for the majority
of toxicity increase after remediation. The overarching goal of this project is to learn to identify remediation
technologies that minimize formation of hazardous PAH breakdown products. Our first specific aim is to
predict, via computational modeling, the secondary transformation products of PAHs that will form during
biotic (microbial) and abiotic (with heat or in situ chemical oxidation) remediation. Our second specific aim is
to measure the secondary PAH transformation products that form during laboratory-scale biotic and abiotic
remediation experiments. We will feed back our data into Aim 1 to refine our computational model. Our third
specific aim is to measure the secondary transformation products of PAHs in real-world Superfund soils and
sediments before and after remediation, as well as after natural attenuation. Our fourth specific aim is a) to
identify remediation technologies, or combinations of remediation technologies, that minimize the formation
of toxic primary and secondary transformation products of PAHs and b) to understand how the optimal
remediation strategy depends on the remediation conditions and on the properties of the soils and sediments.
We also plan to test any new remediation technologies our stakeholders, or other SRP Centers, wish to
evaluate. We will apply passive sampling devices to assess the bioavailability of PAHs and their transformation
products. We also apply soil column leaching techniques to assess their tendency to leach from to soil to
groundwater. These four Specific Aims, taken together, will help us answer our stakeholders' questions
regarding which PAH-transformation products at Superfund sites are hazardous, which transformation
products have the potential to result in human exposure, and which exposures have the potential to
compromise human health. Based on our findings, we will advise the managers of specific Superfund sites
regarding which remediation strategies (or combinations of strategies) minimize the threat to society."
10779066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a degenerative aortopathy that affects children and adults and predisposes
to sudden thoracic aortic dissection. Patients with TAA require lifelong cardiac care intended to prevent
progressive dilation or dissection. Cardiac decision-making requires projection of future risk, but the status quo
for establishing prognosis is not personalized and lacks precision. The basis for rapid progression versus stability
or improvement over time is not understood nor predictable using current approaches. Novel methods to classify
risk for disease progression upon diagnosis are urgently needed. Our long-term objective is to leverage
molecular and image analysis tools to create novel methods to classify risk of aortopathy progression precisely
and identify mechanisms amenable to future therapeutic targeting. Our first aim is to identify genetic variants
that are associated with increased or decreased longitudinal rate of aortic dilation, hypothesizing that single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regulate inter-individual variability in TAA progression. We will perform whole
genome sequencing (WGS) in study participants who are receiving longitudinal pediatric aortopathy care.
Enrollment will occur at two pediatric cardiac centers with subspecialty aortopathy programs: Indiana University
Health’s Riley Hospital and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. We will test SNPs for their association with rates of
aortic dilation using mixed model analysis of serial aortic diameter measurements. In our second aim, we will
leverage our unique aortopathy tissue biobank to identify novel candidate SNPs in transcriptional regulatory
elements that contribute to TAA pathogenesis. We will perform deep RNA sequencing of flash frozen human
TAA tissues and controls and integrate these data with WGS to identify genes with differential allele-specific
expression in TAA. We will directly test the impacts of candidate SNPs in 3’-untranslated regions and enhancers
on allelic transcription using our high-throughput reporter assays in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells.
For our third aim, in collaboration with biomedical engineers at Purdue University, we have pioneered a novel
automated algorithm that tracks aortic root kinematics across cardiac cycles and extracts morphological and
functional metrics using clinical echocardiography. We will establish a large normative data set of novel metrics
in young healthy subjects and compare metrics between TAA cases and matched controls. We hypothesize that
abnormal metrics portend increased rate of aortic dilation at follow-up, helping us predict clinical outcomes. Upon
completion, these aims will elucidate a genetic basis for transcriptional dysregulation in TAA, identify SNPs that
modify TAA progression, and advance echocardiographic phenotyping of the aortic root. Creation of a novel
classifier to predict risk for TAA progression, without significantly modifying existing clinical workflows, is a major
expected outcome. Our biobank’s depth will enable further mechanistic investigation of the SNPs identified in
this study. Automated aortic root phenotyping could transform aortopathy evaluation and propel clinical research."
10779126,"Specific Aims (Revised 1-29-2024)
For treating ovarian cancer, paclitaxel is the front-line drug used in combination with cisplatin/carboplatin, and is also used alone in a dose dense schedule for recurrent cancer. A highly effective anti-microtubule agent, paclitaxel also causes dose-limiting adverse effects. In particular, as many as 80% of patients receiving paclitaxel develop alopecia, which severely impacts patients’ quality of life.
We have discovered that a brief exposure to low-intensity ultrasound can protect various types of proliferating cells from the cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel and cell death in vitro by transiently disrupting paclitaxel-induced formation of rigid and stabilized microtubule bundles. We hypothesize that, through this mechanism, low-intensity ultrasound may prevent alopecia (locally) without compromising the efficacy of systematic cancer therapy. The objectives of the proposal are to test the hypothesis, using human scalp hair follicle organ cultures and suitable mouse models. The initial basic experiments are supported by an DOD pilot funding, and the R01 support will further extend the goals and work, and solidify the results and conclusions, which will guide optimal design of a protocol for clinical trial in the near future.
Specific Aim 1. Investigate mechanisms: breaking of the drug-stabilized microtubules and cellular mechanisms in countering paclitaxel activity.
Sub-Aim 1-1: In cell-free system, we will investigate the fragmentation of polymerized microtubules by low intensity ultrasound, with and without the presence of paclitaxel.
Sub-Aim 1-2: In human scalp hair follicle organ culture, we will study ultrasound impacts on microtubules: their breaking, aggregation of fragments, and degradation by autophagy and in lysosomes.
Sub-Aim 1-3: In human scalp hair follicle organ culture, we will study the ultrasound rescuing of cells death by paclitaxel + carboplatin combination, which is commonly used in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
Sub-Aim 1-4: We will also verify the ability of ultrasound to counter additional taxanes, including docetaxel and cabazitaxel, which are used in treatment of metastatic breast and prostate cancer, respectively.
Sub-Aim 1-5: We will study a serious of time courses, from immediate (5 min), to long term (7 days) of the effects of paclitaxel and/or ultrasound in the human scalp hair follicle organ cultures.
The hair follicle organ culture system will enable our intricate analyses using microscopy and cell biology approaches to interrogate both temporary and permanent paclitaxel-induced damage, and this aim will identify underlying protective mechanisms of ultrasound therapy.
Specific Aim 2. Verify the prevention of hair follicle damage and study the mechanism of ultrasound in countering paclitaxel cytotoxicity in live mice.
Sub-Aim 2-1: We will carry out extensive analyses to verify the biology and mechanisms in live mice.
Sub-Aim 2-2: In human scalp hair follicle organ culture, we will study the ultrasound rescuing of cells death by paclitaxel + carboplatin combination, which is commonly used in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
Sub-Aim 2-3: We will also verify the ability of ultrasound to counter additional taxanes, including docetaxel and cabazitaxel, which are used in treatment of metastatic breast and prostate cancer, respectively.
Sub-Aim 2-4: Single cell RNA-seq technology will be used to analyze hair follicles to determine the overall expression profiles of various cell types impacted by paclitaxel and/or ultrasound.
Sub-Aim 2-5: The study in mouse models also will determine in long term (3 to 6 months) impacts of drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) and ultrasound on hair follicles and skin in mice, to determine any potential side effects of ultrasound treatment.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the ability of ultrasound to prevent paclitaxel-caused hair follicle damage and loss in a mouse model grafted with human scalp hair, and the long-term consequences.
Sub-Aim 3-1: We have established a humanized alopecia mouse model by transplanting human scalp haired skin onto immune compromised mice. We will test if ultrasound exposure can prevent hair follicle damage and hair loss caused by paclitaxel treatment in the model.
Sub-Aim 3-2: In addition to analyze the acute (1 to 7 days following drug and ultrasound treatment) effects, the experiments will also include long term (3 to 6 months after procedure) effects to verify the mechanisms uncovered in mouse models, and to determine if any potential side effects and safety of ultrasound treatment on human hair follicles. Sub-Aim 3-3: With additional recourse, we will be able to study an increase number of mice implanted with human hair follicles to obtain strong statistical results. This will also allow us to compare and determine the potential differential responses of the hair follicles to paclitaxel and/or ultrasound in correlation with genders, age, and racial ancestral, to determine if biological differences exist.
The aims and experiments in the proposed project will help to translate and develop a basic science discovery into clinical practice, to establish a procedure to prevent hair loss in cancer treatment. If successful, the project will have major impact to the quality of life issue for cancer patients."
10877008,"Approximately half a million patients undergo cardiac surgery in the United States each year. Acute kidney
injury (AKI) complicates 25% of cases, and is associated with increased hospital length of stay, cost,
progression to chronic kidney disease and death. Inadequate blood pressure during the early postoperative
period is a likely contributor to AKI after cardiac surgery that may be effectively addressed with a higher target
mean arterial pressure (MAP) during this period. Current practice typically targets a MAP ≥65 mmHg after
cardiac surgery but whether this is the optimal target pressure for minimizing kidney injury is unknown.
 The long-term objective of our research is to minimize the incidence of AKI after adult cardiac surgery
through identification of an optimal postoperative target MAP in this setting. The objective of the proposed
cohort study is to harness existing minute-by-minute postoperative MAP data from patients undergoing cardiac
surgery to identify a postoperative MAP threshold beyond which the risk of AKI increases and, separately,
explore for evidence of association between early postoperative MAP and other non-renal harm that may also
need consideration in selecting the most appropriate target-MAP for testing in a clinical trial.
 Our Specific Aims are to: 1a) Evaluate the association between time spent in each of multiple
absolute MAP range-bands (e.g., 65-69, 70-74 mmHg) through the first 24 hours(h) after cardiac surgery
and AKI; 1b) Evaluate the association between time spent in each of multiple discrete MAP range-
bands defined by the percent change from preoperative baseline MAP (e.g., -6 to -10%, -11 to -15%)
through the first 24h after cardiac surgery and AKI; 2a) Evaluate the association between time spent in
each of multiple absolute MAP range-bands through the first 24h after cardiac surgery and non-renal
adverse outcomes including each of delirium, stroke, blood transfusion and unplanned surgical re-
exploration; 2b) Evaluate the association between time spent in each of multiple discrete MAP range-
bands defined by percent change from preoperative baseline MAP through the first 24h after cardiac
surgery and the specified non-renal adverse outcomes. These aims will be achieved by regression
modelling of longitudinal MAP profiles created from minute-by-minute MAP data through 24h postoperatively in
patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Combined with validated outcome data and adjusted for key potentially
confounding covariates appropriate to each outcome, we will test the hypothesis that: Increased time spent
with MAP in each of the multiple discrete range-bands through 24h after surgery (relative to a reference MAP
range-band) is associated with an increased odds for AKI and, separately, other non-renal outcomes. Our
results will provide critical evidence to guide the data-driven selection of the most appropriate target MAP for a
future trial testing the effectiveness of this alternate target MAP to reduce AKI and improve patient outcome
after cardiac surgery."
10744177,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year, up to 50,000 patients in the United States receive unnecessary thyroidectomies. These unnecessary
thyroidectomies are due to difficulties in preoperatively distinguishing benign thyroid nodules from thyroid
cancers. In preliminary data, we developed an epigenetic test that shows promise to distinguish benign versus
malignant thyroid nodules. Here, we will rigorously test and validate the ability of our epigenetic biomarkers to
evaluate the biologic aggressiveness of thyroid nodules and determine whether the new epigenetic testing will
improve thyroid nodule management towards the eradication of unnecessary thyroidectomies. Current molecular
diagnostics for indeterminate thyroid nodules, while providing some improvement, have not eliminated the
unnecessary thyroidectomies. Current molecular diagnostics are based on molecular differences between
normal thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer. However, benign thyroid nodules can contain many molecular
alterations including gene fusions and mutations. As a result, over half of thyroid nodules with a significant cancer
risk according to the current molecular classifiers are found to be benign after thyroidectomy. In our published
preliminary data, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 109 surgically excised thyroid
nodules and adjacent benign tissue. We found that the DNA methylation pattern in benign nodules is different
from thyroid cancer and normal thyroid. Based on the DNA methylation pattern specific to benign nodules and
the DNA methylation pattern specific to thyroid cancer, we developed the Diagnostic DNA Methylation Signature
(DDMS) approach to distinguish between benign versus malignant nodules. In a retrospective pilot study
performed under 1R21CA223367, we developed DDMS further (DDMS-2). We tested the ability of the DDMS-2
assay to distinguish benign from malignant surgically excised thyroid nodules (n=121). In this Pilot study, DDMS-
2 had an estimated positive predictive value (PPV) of 96% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%. Guided
by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that DDMS (i) can be successfully used for molecular thyroid cancer
diagnostics of pre-operative thyroid nodule aspirations; (ii) will have superior performance in comparison to
current thyroid cancer molecular testing and (iii) can affect physician decision-making towards elimination of
unnecessary thyroidectomies. We will accomplish our overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims:
Aim 1: To perform analytical validation of the DDMS-2 assay. Aim 2: To determine the DDMS-2 accuracy in a
prospective cohort obtained from 7 medical centers and containing 1450 thyroid nodule aspirations including
800 aspirations with indeterminate cytopathology. Aim 3: To compare the diagnostic accuracy between DDMS-
2 and two current thyroid cancer molecular diagnostic approaches and to evaluate how the knowledge of the
DDMS-2 results impacts clinical management of thyroid nodules. The development of a more accurate assay to
distinguish benign and malignant thyroid nodules will address current clinical limitations and reduce the number
of needless thyroidectomies and associated morbidities."
10744201,"Research Abstract: Autoimmune uveitis is a serious sight-threatening condition defined by an autoreactive
immune response against the retina and uveal tissues. In autoimmune uveitis, the retina and uveal tissues
become a target of autoreactive immune cells, which leads to irreversible neural damages and can progress to
significant visual impairment. Since the retina is a so-called “immune privileged” tissue protected by blood-
retinal barrier, how immune cells gain entry into the retina and what antigen presenting cell (APC) populations
are involved in local antigen presentation have been a long discussion. This proposal describes aims to
elucidate an innovative mechanism whereby retinal microglia mediate autoreactive immune cell entry into the
retina. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, including the retina, and function
in the homeostatic maintenance of the neuro-retinal microenvironment. The role and function of microglia in
disease progression is not well understood due to their multiple phenotypes and/or different stages of
activation that are associated with either harmful or beneficial effects in disease pathogenesis.
Our recent work demonstrated that microglial depletion inhibits development of EAU and that microglia are
essential to disease induction. Interestingly, retinal microglia are significantly activated in response to EAU
disease induction, quickly localizing to the retinal vasculature. However, our data indicated that microglia do
not function as APCs in disease initiation, but in fact function to facilitate infiltration of a variety of circulating
immune cells into the neuroretina. Our data highly suggested that microglia are key population that initiates
blood-retinal barrier breakdown and that the circulating APCs and T cells that enter the retina trigger the
subsequent vision altering auto-inflammatory response. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs
remains unknown.
In this proposal, we will elucidate the mechanism by which autoreactive immune cells gain entry into the retina
and how the subsequent autoimmune response develops during disease progression in a mouse model of
experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). We will begin by defining the initiating APC populations in EAU and
the contribution of microglial expression of MHC-II during EAU disease progression. Moreover, we will identify
the activation and kinetics of retinal microglia and infiltrating immune cells in EAU induction by using a single
cell RNA sequence profiling. Lastly, we will define the role of SIRPalpha/CD47, an immune axis that is highly
regulated in EAU and that functions in phagocytosis initiation and immune cell reactivity. Understanding the
mechanism by which microglia initiate autoimmune uveitis will likely open new avenues of therapy for this
disease as well as other blinding neovascular ophthalmic diseases."

Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) comprises an expanding array of inherited disorders of the
immune system characterized by severe hyperinflammation. Despite use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone,
chemotherapeutic agent etoposide, specific cytokine-targeting agents, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, up to 40% of pHLH patients die due to uncontrolled disease or the complications of its
treatment. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to develop new and more effective therapies. To date,
much of what we have learned about the pathogenesis of pHLH has come from the study of humans and mice
lacking expression of perforin, a pore forming protein essential for the cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells and
natural killer (NK) cells. Following infection with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), perforin-deficient
mice develop a fatal HLH-like illness characterized by organomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
hypercytokinemia, hyperferritinemia, and fulminant tissue inflammation. Due to their cytolytic defects, perforin-
deficient CD8 T and NK cells cannot eliminate LCMV-infected antigen presenting cells (APCs). It has been
proposed that the persistence of these activated APCs results in a feed-forward loop to further drive T cell
proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production, ultimately culminating in the signs and symptoms of HLH.
Within APCs, the immunoproteasome processes endogenous and exogenous proteins, including viral proteins,
into peptides that are loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHCI) molecules for presentation
to other cells of the immune system. Given the persistence of activated APCs in pHLH and the central role
for antigen presentation in driving immune cell activation, we hypothesize that inhibiting the
immunoproteasome will serve as a rational and potentially beneficial therapeutic maneuver. Indeed, using
an in vitro model of LCMV infection, we observe that the immunoproteasome inhibitors ONX-914 and KZR-616
significantly reduce LCMV-specific CD8 T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFNg) production. Similarly,
treatment of LCMV-infected perforin-deficient mice with KZR-616 significantly diminishes the manifestations of
HLH, including splenomegaly, CD8 T cell expansion, tissue immunopathology, and serum IFNg levels. In this
R21 Exploratory Research Grant, which is being submitted in response to Notice of Special Interest:
Investigations on Inborn Errors of Immunity/Primary Immunodeﬁciencies (NOT-AI-21-032), we will further
explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action of immunoproteasome inhibition using the perforin-
deficient mouse model. In Aim 1, we will examine the extent to which immunoproteasome inhibition ameliorates
clinical disease, testing specific drug schedules and combinations. Aim 2 will explore the mechanistic basis
using complementary in vivo and in vitro assays. If successful, these studies will elucidate whether
immunoproteasome inhibition lessens inflammation in pHLH and set the stage for future clinical trials
aimed at improving the overall outcome for individuals with these often-fatal immune system disorders."

This grant proposes research on the molecular mechanisms that control the electrical activity of adult cardiac
ventricular myocytes. Our focus is on the cardiac intercalated disc (ID), a region of the cell recognized as key to
excitability and propagation and yet, only partly characterized in terms of its molecular composition, regulation
and function. Our objective is to obtain a map of this structure by integrating proximity and visual proteomics,
genomics, physiomics and molecule-specific physiology. We will study control hearts as well as those deficient
in Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), an ID molecule that when mutated can cause lethal arrhythmias in the young.
The ID was first described as an interdigitation of cell membranes at the site of end-end apposition between
adult ventricular myocytes, hosting three electron-dense structures: gap junctions, desmosomes and adherens
junctions (later redefined as mixed junctions or area composita1). More recent work shows that the ID also hosts
protein complexes fundamental to electrophysiology. In fact, more than 70 years since it was described as an
electron-dense structure, the ID emerges as a node that congregates the molecular machinery involved in all
aspects of electrical activity: excitation, repolarization, propagation and control of Ca2+i.
Despite the known importance of the ID in cell function, there is a wide knowledge gap regarding its molecular
composition and its varied functional roles. Part of this limitation results from the fact that, as opposed to other
membrane-wrapped cell components (e.g., mitochondria), isolation of the ID as a single organelle has not been
possible given its complex geometry, and the fact that it is open to the cell interior without a limiting barrier of its
own. Here, we circumvent these limitations by combining proximity and visual proteomics. The list of interactors
will serve as a platform to query genomics and phenotype data, and to guide molecule-specific studies.
Cardiac arrhythmias are common, debilitating and in many cases, fatal. Progress has been made in the
development of devices and invasive strategies which, as sophisticated and life-saving as they are, can also
cause serious and irreparable damage to the heart. In the context of medical therapy, the field of arrhythmias
has been lagging behind others (e.g., cancer therapy), where a deep understanding of molecular components
and their interdependence have led to the discovery of chemical agents that can slow down or arrest disease
progression. We do not claim that our study can stop arrhythmias. But we do believe that knowledge of the
molecular elements involved in rhythm control can lead to better risk assessment, diagnosis, prevention and
therapy. The ID is a domain that concentrates multiple rhythm-control molecules and as such, a perfect target
for applying proximity-based methods to advance our knowledge on the control of the heart rhythm."

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Though the risk of mortality from
stroke has declined with advances in reperfusion therapies, the number of survivors developing long-term
cognitive impairment has increased with patients experiencing deficits across multiple cognitive domains
including short-term memory, executive function and language. While significant research efforts have focused
on neuroprotective strategies to reduce infarct volume following ischemic insult, numerous clinical trials showed
no improvements functional outcome, despite effective reduction in infarct volume. For this proposal, I consider
potential molecular targets for neurorestorative strategies, which aim to restore neural networks perturbed by
ischemic injury. I specifically investigate molecular targets which improve Schaffer-CA1 hippocampal long-term
potentiation (LTP), one of the mechanisms thought to underlie learning and memory, at both acute and delayed
timepoints following stroke. By targeting hippocampal pathways, we aim to reduce the burden of cognitive
deficits experienced by numerous patients following ischemic stroke.
The transient receptor potential melastatin-related 2 channel (TRPM2) ion channel serves as a promising
candidate for pharmacologic intervention post-stroke. TRPM2 is a nonselective cation channel, well-studied due
to its sensitivity to oxidative stress and its implication in various central nervous system pathologies. Here, we
demonstrate TRPM2 global knockout or pharmacologic inhibition restores hippocampal LTP and hippocampal-
dependent learning and memory in a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). However, the
cell-type specific role of TRPM2 and its mechanism of activation remain largely unknown. In this proposal, I
examine the neuronal contribution of TRPM2 to hippocampal synaptic and cognitive impairment in a mouse
model of MCAO. I also provide compelling preliminary evidence the ectoenzyme, CD38, is upregulated in
astrocytes following MCAO, generating ligand necessary for TRPM2 activation, thereby producing cognitive
deficits in both sexes. To further elucidate the cell-specific role of TRPM2 and its mechanism of activation, I
propose to employ in vitro and in vivo electrophysiologic, molecular and neurobehavioral approaches. In this
proposal, I investigate a novel neuroglial mechanism to uncover potential molecular targets for acute and chronic
pharmacologic intervention to reduce the burden of cognitive disability following ischemic stroke."

This project will identify the immune states present in 250 SLE patients in long-term drug free
remission (+/- hydroxychloroquine) by analyzing 1) blood for composition of immune cells, 2) the
transcriptional epigenetic and proteomic profile of blood immune cells at the single cell level,
and 3) determining the repertoire of B cells in blood that react with nuclear antigens. The data
will be analyzed in comparison to 60 active SLE patients and 60 healthy controls and will
provide insight into the heterogeneity of immune profiles in patients in remission and the
homeostatic mechanisms to sustain remission. As 25% will likely relapse over 5 years, the
studies may also identify predictors of relapse."
10763691,"Abstract – Project 2
The overall goals of Project 2 are to localize and quantify patterns of central nervous system
(CNS) dysfunction in SLE patients in long-term clinical remission (SLE-R) and to identify a
relevant imaging marker. This has important potential treatment implications as our preliminary
data suggest that, despite clinical quiescence, some SLE-R have ongoing CNS dysfunction that
may promote progressive cognitive decline and contribute to relapse. Our Specific Aims are:
 1. to investigate regional brain metabolism using FDG PET, blood brain barrier permeability
 (BBBP) using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI), neuropsychological (NP)
 performance and serum Quinolinic/Kynurenic acid ratio (Q/K; a marker of CNS
 pathology) in SLE-R,
 2. to investigate microglial (MG) activation in SLE-R using [11C]-PBR28 PET, and
 3. to identify and validate a SLE-R functional brain network using resting state functional
 MRI (rs-fMRI) and to evaluate associations between the SLE-R network and NP
 performance, Q/K ratios and risk of relapse.
A subgroup of eligible subjects from Project 1, 60 SLE-R, 20 SLE with active disease (SLE-A)
and 31 healthy controls (HC), will all have imaging studies, NP testing and serum Q/K evaluated
at baseline. SLE-R subjects will have repeat evaluations after 18-24 months and/or at the time
of clinical relapse. CNS subjects will be recruited at all sites, reflecting significant geographic,
ethnic and racial diversity. The planned analyses will allow us to develop neurophenotypes,
defined by imaging measures, Q/K ratio and NP performance, for SLE-R. We expect to identify
a range of neurophenotypes among SLE-R; some SLE-R will resemble HC, others will resemble
SLE-A and perhaps others will have a phenotype that correlates with relapse. In collaboration
with the Biostatistics and Data Integration Core we will further explore the heterogeneity among
SLE-R neurophenotypes and associations with the immune phenotypes identified in Project 1."
10779739,"The intestinal tract is comprised of functionally different regions, each having distinct and highly selected microbiota assembled through evolutionary and ecological drivers to achieve a mutualistic relationship important to host health. However, with ever increasing shifts in environment, diet, lifestyles, and prevalent use of antibiotics it is becoming evident that perturbations of host-microbial balance affect states of health and give rise to a multitude of disorders. This recognition has fostered interest in “natural” remedies such as Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) and Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs) to maintain or restore gut microbiota health in patients with Clostridioides difficile infection and other disorders (IBD, metabolic disorders). However, one has to question the appropriateness of these preparations, given that most are comprised of colonic anaerobic microbes not indigenous or fit to inhabit the small intestine. Mismatches between regional host gut ecosystems and their microbiota could have adverse consequences to the host. This possibility leads us to hypothesize that colonic microbiota of FMT will not properly restore the microbiome of the small intestine (and vice versa) and that this will have long-term regional and systemic consequences. Our preliminary data show merit for this hypothesis, i.e., the engraftment of donor microbiota in non-indigenous ecosystems create mismatches that lead to regional and systemic consequences particularly of immune and metabolic networks that persist at least 3 months in a post-antibiotic (Abx) microbial transplant murine model. Planned studies will employ in vivo and in vitro experimental models to assess the long-term impact (one-year post transplant) of regional microbiota on host tissues because studies of this nature are technically challenging if not infeasible in human subjects. We propose two specific aims: (1) to examine to what extent do post-Abx jejunal (JMT) vs fecal (FMT) microbiota transplants restore regional gut microbiota composition and function, and host immune and metabolic function following antibiotic-induced dysbiosis compared to cecal microbiota transplant (CMT) and saline controls; and (2) to determine the direct impact of JMT vs FMT-specific microbes identified through a novel cross ‘omics bioinformatic integration platform and their metabolites on host metabolism and immune function using in vivo and in vitro approaches. To reflect the cut in the budget, we propose assessing outcomes after one year of transplant vs assessing outcomes at also 3 and 6 months given that we have extensive preliminary data for the earlier time points. Findings of Aim 1 will raise awareness of the potential concerns of improper restitution of regional gut microbiota with microbiota transplants that may require a rethinking of current FMT practices and LBP formulations. Aim 2 will provide insights to how to solve the problem, creating a new path for future and more strategic development of effective and safe omni-microbial transplants (OMTs). This multi-PI study stems from a long-time collaboration between laboratories of Drs. Eugene Chang and Kristina Martinez-Guryn that have complementary expertise in the study of immunity and metabolism."

A variety of cellular processes are commonly subverted to encourage the proliferation of cancer cells,
one of which is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
Importantly, there is also a strong connection between UPR and inflammation or neuronal health.
Many neurodegenerative diseases and diseases of aging have connections to the UPR. We have
recently discovered a new form of BiP regulation, AMPylation by the protein Fic. We observe that Fic
adds an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) molecule to a threonine near the ATP binding site of BiP
during normal growth conditions. This modification rapidly is removed by the same enzyme Fic under
multiple ER stress-inducing conditions. We recently have shown that the regulation of BiP by Fic is
essential for maintaining neuronal homeostasis. Since our discovery of Fic domains that mediate
AMPylation, other diverse activities performed by bacterial Fic domains have been identified. These
studies have revealed the molecular plasticity of Fic domains in its ability to utilize diverse substrates.
Despite these studies, there are many different Fic proteins that remain to be characterized, both in
catalytic activity, biological function, and molecular targets. We propose three projects that will further
our understanding of the biology of Fic enzymes and the chemistry they use, both in vitro and in vivo.
First, when the ER is stressed, Fic changes from an AMPylator to a deAMPylator, and the key to this
regulation is breaking a salt bridge in Fic's active site. We want to understand the biochemistry
regulating this switch. Second, our studies with Drosophila genetics show that Fic is required for
neuronal plasticity. We are therefore interested in understanding what role Fic plays in mammalian
biology using transgenic mice. Third, there are many different Fic proteins that remain to be
characterized, both in catalytic activity, biological function, and molecular targets. We plan to
investigate these orphan Fic domains and identify their biological activities and substrates."

The overall goal of this proposal is to reveal central regulators of microglial attributes that can impact
synapses. Synaptic dysfunction is tightly linked to declining cognition and neuronal health during aging. A long-
standing mystery in neuroscience is why some CNS neurons are more vulnerable to age-associated synapse
loss and neurodegenerative disease. Microglia are well-positioned to influence synapses throughout the
lifespan, being equipped to induce synapse formation, synapse elimination and alter synapse composition
through multiple mechanisms. Moreover, synapse-relevant attributes of microglia change during aging,
including their cell process motility, phagocytic behaviors, and production of inflammatory factors. We and
others recently discovered that microglia exhibit region-specific phenotypes, raising the possibility that
microglial regulation of synaptic health varies. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that ventral tegmental
area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) microglia begin to proliferate and produce inflammatory
factors during midlife in mice, and months before microglia in other basal ganglia nuclei. These “pockets” of
early inflammation are likely detrimental to synaptic function of nearby dopamine neurons, which are highly
vulnerable to functional decline and degenerative disease during aging. Here, we will investigate the possibility
that microglial lysosomes can simultaneously regulate multiple synapse-relevant attributes of these cells, and
that regional differences in lysosome function give rise to regional variation in microglial aging and synapse
vulnerability. Lysosomes are typically viewed as purely degradative organelles, but new data show that they
are intimately involved in membrane recycling and intracellular signaling that can shape cell properties. Indeed,
lysosomes play a central role in regulating macrophage phenotype, including their inflammatory profiles,
phagocytosis, and responses to aging. Our findings suggest that lysosomes play similar regulatory roles within
microglia; the region-specific phenotypes and responses to aging that we observe within VTA/SNc microglia
were accompanied by prominent differences in lysosome abundance, expression of lysosome component
genes, and rates of lysosome overload with protein-lipid aggregates, compared to microglia in other basal
ganglia nuclei. Nonetheless, surprising little is known about microglial lysosomes in vivo. Focusing on the basal
ganglia and working in mice, we will use multidisciplinary approaches to define the composition and functional
status of microglial lysosomes across brain regions and lifespan (Aim 1). We developed novel methods to
manipulate microglial lysosome overload and will determine how this shapes synapse-relevant microglial
attributes during aging (Aim 2). Finally, we will directly measure how microglial lysosome overload affects
lifespan synaptic integrity and function in distinct brain regions (Aim 3). These studies will reveal whether these
organelles are central orchestrators of microglial phenotype and will identify molecular targets for promoting
neuroprotective microglial phenotypes to preserve synaptic function in vulnerable populations of neurons."

10766788,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is an increasingly recognized condition characterized by acute, reversible systolic
heart failure which uniquely affects older women (more than 90% of cases). Although most patients recover
after an acute episode, survivors have a high risk of long-term major cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and of
chronic impairments of the left ventricular (LV) function. Despite its clinical relevance, important knowledge
gaps exist about this interesting and perhaps underappreciated condition. While there is a general consensus
that an exaggerated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) discharge is the final common pathophysiologic event
that underlies the onset of acute systolic heart failure in TS, this condition has considerable heterogeneity.
First, exposure to an emotional trigger was thought to be a defining precipitant of TS, but recent registry data
indicate instead that emotional triggers are present only in 1/3 of cases, with physical triggers (1/3) and no
triggers (1/3) accounting for the remaining cases. Second, the pathophysiological pathway linking the
precipitating trigger to the onset of TS remains to be articulated. Third, it is unclear why certain individuals
develop an exaggerated SNS response when exposed to emotional triggers which sooner or later affect all
individuals throughout the lifespan with no or limited health consequences. Finally, no study has rigorously
tested the contribution of triggering event and mental stress responsiveness to the long-term prognosis of
these patients. To address these key evidence gaps we will conduct a mechanistic clinical trial among 246
newly admitted patients with a validated diagnosis of TS from 3 large medical centers in the Providence, RI
area. Participants will undergo a comprehensive interview to identify the events proximal to the onset of TS
and complete a battery of psychosocial questionnaires 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Approximately 4
weeks after discharge they will undergo a laboratory mental stress protocol previously utilized by our group.
Baseline and reactive changes in measures of autonomic nervous system activity (circulating catecholamines
and cardiac vagal control), LV function (2D speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE)), and hemodynamic
parameters will be assessed. LV function and MACCE will be assessed 12 months later. The proposed study
will address the noted evidence gaps by a) Rigorously assessing the full range of circumstances proximal to
TS onset, b) Assessing the constellation of physiological elements that define TS (autonomic nervous system
activity and LV function) under controlled conditions, and c) Link the type of trigger to physiology. Furthermore,
by using 2D-STE we will be able to capture both reactive and long-term subtle anomalies of LV function in
these patients. This will be the first study to rigorously investigate the heterogeneity in clinical presentation,
physiopathology, and prognosis in TS. The identification of distinct sub-groups in TS will provide the rationale
for the design and testing of properly targeted interventions to improve the prognosis of these patients."

The goal of this research program is to understand the interactions between lung epithelial and mesenchymal
cells in sufficient detail to deliver new therapeutic interventions in pulmonary fibrosis, a process without disease
modifying therapies. This program is anchored by a recently funded RO1 to further elucidate mechanisms of a
fibroblast-specific trihydroxyphenolic inhibitor of LOXL2 and TGFR1 with potent in vivo anti-fibrotic effects. We
will test one of these, EGCG, in a proof of principle clinical trial. Unpublished data show reversal of a core set
of pro-fibrotic tissue biomarkers in IPF patients given EGCG two weeks prior to diagnostic lung biopsy. The
R35 mechanism allows us to integrate our capacity to attenuate fibrosis with the broader issue of defective
epithelial regeneration in IPF, a competing process with fibrogenesis. This is sometimes simplified in the idea
repeated epithelial injury leads to stem cell failure thereby creating an unrelenting pro-fibrotic environment. But
the lung is resilient with multiple, spatially distinct progenitor cells whose identify and integrative functions
remain poorly understood, especially in IPF patients. This paradigm also overlooks the potentially critical
contribution of pro-fibrotic mesenchymal cells in driving further loss of the epithelium. Type II cells in the IPF
lung at the time of lung transplant are less than 15% of that present in a normal lung. The program will focus
on further elucidating the potential of resident epithelial stem/progenitors in mouse and human to regenerate
alveolar integrity. In parallel, mechanisms by which activated mesenchymal cells contribute to dysfunction and
loss of these epithelial progenitors will be defined. We plan to leverage fibroblast-specific TGFb1 inhibition to
study its impact on progenitor cells in both animal models and in IPF patients, for example by single cell RNA-
seq of tissues from untreated and EGCG treated patients. We envision a future small molecule image-based
screen to identify agents that improve type II cell health in cultured epithelial/fibroblast organoids. Overall the
R35 program gives us the opportunity to integrate all of these directions into a centrally themed,
multidimensional approach that should transform how we view lung regeneration and fibrogenesis and how we
treat patients with unrelenting fibrosis."

effects of COVID-19. Specifically, using Bayesian machine learning and hierarchical time-series modeling of
longitudinal ABCD data, this proposal will establish, refine, and deploy models of normative trajectories in brain
development and quantify deviations related to substance-use risk (AIM 1). Further, this effort will carefully
contextualize the effects of the COVID-19 crisis as a US-wide event with deep consequences for child
development (AIM 2). As a primary research product of this proposal, all derived models and functional
connectivity metrics will be shared via ABCD’s central repository (AIM 3). This will include (i) complete neural
‘fingerprints’ or functional connectivity matrices for all task-based data from ages 10-14; (ii) derived normative
‘growth curves’, and (iii) the full generative probabilistic models for reuse by other laboratories. This key data
contribution will relieve logistic burdens for a large number of research labs and further promote widespread use
of ABCD data, propelling comparability and reproducibility of single-subject prediction studies towards identifying
a reliable predictor of substance-use initiation in youth. This is a critical step toward precision psychiatry and will
shed light on individual difference factors that contribute to vulnerability in the exigent context of the evolving
COVID-19 pandemic. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of substance-
use phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts."
10765081,"This project provides support for methods development in Cryo Electron Microscopy (CryoEM) and cellular
Cryo Electron Tomography (CryoET), with a focus on software methods for extracting maximal biological
information from the collected image data. Our methods development is driven by specific diverse and
important biological projects. When imaging, electron beam causes damage to the specimen as it is being
imaged, so very low doses must be used, leading to images with extremely high relative noise levels.
Additionally, the targets being imaged are typically individual molecules or macromolecular assemblies,
~10-30 nm in size, >10x smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These targets are ostensibly identical,
in that they all represent the same molecular species, but when imaging inside vitrified cells, the targeted
macromolecules will typically be interacting with other molecules and often undergoing significant dynamics.
Even when studying purified molecules in CryoEM, the molecules represent their solution configuration,
frozen in a single instant in time, and each will also be in a random 3-D orientation. Image processing must
then take these very noisy 2-D images of 3-D molecules in random orientations, with compositional and
conformational variability, and produce one or more high resolution 3-D structures. This proposal seeks to
improve the methods used to perform these tasks, apply the developed methods to important biological
projects, and disseminate the methods to CryoEM/ET users around the world to help solve additional
biological problems. A range of different methods will be developed, and we will adapt to the needs of the
field over time. Deep learning approaches combined with Gaussian modeling are providing promising
results in simultaneously characterizing molecular variability and structure, and there are hopes that this
method may eventually extend to near-atomic resolution. In cells, a key need is to annotate subcellular
features and identify specific macromolecules of interest. Valuable biological information can come from the
annotation of overall features, the structures of macromolecules within the cell, and by combining this
information; that is, not just studying all macromolecules of a particular type, but also considering where
individual macromolecules are within the cell, relative to other cellular components. The new methods we
are developing will enable cell and structural biologists to study cells in new ways, asking questions about
molecular interactions and functional conformational changes of macromolecules in a cellular context."

 I have a long-standing interest in chromosome biology, and in recent years this has expanded to cover
multiple aspects of mammalian nuclear cell biology. We are pursuing investigations in two areas, both involving
dramatic protein relocalizations related to human health.
 One project is focused on tumor marker protein Ki-67, and how it protects chromosomes. Ki-67 organizes
heterochromatin at the nucleolus during interphase, relocalizes to coat mitotic chromosomes, and is important
for tumor growth and metastasis. We discovered that acute depletion of Ki-67 causes DNA damage during
mitosis, and that defects are more severe when Ki-67 and p53 are simultaneously depleted. We also discovered
that the C-terminal chromatin-binding domain of Ki-67 (termed “LR”, based on its leucine-arginine dipeptide
motifs) is necessary and sufficient to protect cells from damage when endogenous Ki-67 is depleted. Therefore,
we will analyze how Ki-67 protects DNA, and map where in the genome this is most important.
 We will determine which LR residues affect its ability to anchor Ki-67 to chromosomes and protect them from
mitotic damage, focused on sites of mitotic phosphorylation and blocks of charged residues. Data from these
cellular function experiments will guide biochemical studies of nucleic acid and nucleosome binding.
Concurrently, we are working collaboratively to solve the structure of the LR-nucleosome complexes. We have
obtained cryoEM data indicating where LR binds the nucleosome surface, and binding studies with mutant
nucleosomes confirm these findings. In addition to biochemical and biophysical investigations, we will determine
whether specific genomic loci are damaged when Ki-67 is lost. To test this, we will take advantage of our finding
that the 3’OH groups at DNA strand breaks caused by Ki-67 depletion can be enzymatically labeled. We will use
this property to generate genome-scale libraries to map the damage at the nucleotide level and we will determine
whether the patterns are cell-type specific.
 Macrophages are a critically important cell type in our innate immune system, which must mount rapid
responses to the presence of infectious agents. The speed and importance of these responses make
macrophages an ideal system for studying dynamic events in the mammalian nucleus. We have established a
research project based on our discovery that macrophages relocalize proteins and nuclear bodies related to
RNA splicing in response to interferon-gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharides, which together promote pro-
inflammatory “M1” differentiation. These rearrangements require specific signaling events, because they are
blocked by inhibition of p38 MAPK kinases and do not occur during anti-inflammatory “M2” differentiation in
response to cytokine IL-4. We are therefore investigating which RNA processing events and protein partners are
the key regulatory molecules related to these nuclear body dynamics during macrophage differentiation."

This MIRA renewal focuses on the cell biology of iron and to a more limited extent on copper. Transition metals
have exceptional properties that render them indispensable for life, but they are also dangerous to the cell, such
that trafficking must be tightly regulated. The PI is developing innovative and powerful approaches to fill huge
gaps in understanding transition metal ion trafficking and regulation, especially in mitochondria which are iron
and copper “traffic hubs”, and in the cytosolic Labile Fe Pool (LFeP) which accepts nutrient iron and distributes
them to ~ 100 client apo-proteins in yeast cells. The chemical identity of the LFeP remains unestablished due to
its inherent lability. To investigate such pools, the PI and his coworkers employ a novel custom liquid
chromatography system in a refrigerated anaerobic glove box interfaced to an inductively-coupled plasma mass
spectrometer (ICP-MS). Mössbauer (MB) spectroscopy is used to characterize the iron content of 57Fe-enriched
cells, organelles, mouse organs, and blood plasma. Differential equations-based mathematical models are
designed and developed to help understand the kinetics and mechanism of Fe trafficking in growing yeast cells.
Few groups use any one of these innovative tools and no other lab worldwide uses all of them. This affords the
PI a unique opportunity to solve critical problems in this field. In the past 5 years, with NIH MIRA support, the PI
has published 23 peer-reviewed papers. Moving forward, the Lindahl lab will continue to investigate labile metal
pools in biological systems using these approaches, coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS). Innovative chromatographic methods will be developed to minimize the lability of metal complexes.
Most studies will use yeast cells, but labile metal pools in mammalian cells will also be investigated. How the
LFeP changes with different genetic strains, metabolic conditions, and nutrient levels will be assessed. The LFeP
in intact yeast cells will be detected and characterized by MB spectroscopy. The Fe/S species (known as X-S)
that is exported from mitochondria into the cytosol will be identified. The LFeP in mitochondria will be
reinvestigated using improved methods. Sophisticated and realistic mathematical models will be developed to
simulate the kinetics of Fe trafficking and regulation. Whether non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), found in iron-
overload diseases, is a high-molecular-mass FeIII aggregate or an FeIII citrate complex will be determined.
Copper homeostasis and the mechanism of copper trafficking from cytosol to mitochondria will be probed,
focusing on the role of metallothionein Cup1 in homeostasis, and on Cox17 and small nonproteinaceous CuLMM
complexes as candidate trafficking species. Low-molecular mass CuLMM complex(es) will be isolated and
identified by ESI-MS."

 Drug discovery is tremendously costly and failure-prone, complicating advances that would otherwise im-
prove human health. Computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) accelerates this process by predicting molecules
with pharmacological potential before synthesis and testing. These bioactive molecules also serve as chemical
probes for studying fundamental biological processes. But despite notable successes, CADD methods still suf-
fer in terms of accuracy and accessibility. The Durrant lab addresses these challenges by developing
innovative, user-friendly technologies to (1) identify new bioactive small molecules and (2) improve their phar-
macological properties, with the ultimate goal of helping the scientific community develop new therapies for
patients in need.
 In recent years, we have developed tools that characterize the surface pockets of disease-implicated pro-
teins where such compounds (e.g., drugs) interact. These tools identify pocket locations and predict pocket
flexibility. We have also developed modeling techniques to better predict protein/molecule binding geometries
(binding poses), as well as methods that suggest chemical additions to improve binding (lead optimization).
These methods broadly apply to many proteins, so our research is not tied to a single system or disease. Still,
to rigorously validate our techniques, we have partnered with experimentalists studying diverse proteins impli-
cated in protein synthesis, metabolism, cancer, and viral infections. Our work has been cited thousands of
times, demonstrating impact. Further, our online tools have been accessed over 100,000 times, serving as a
useful community resource. The lab has attracted funding from university, government, and industry partners.
 In the next five years, we will continue to develop innovative CADD methods while expanding in new direc-
tions. Our focus is on improving the accuracy, accessibility, and broad adoption of CADD approaches. First, we
will create a big-data database of predicted protein-ligand complexes to improve the accuracy of structure-
based machine-learning models. This database will greatly expand the structural data available for training and
so will serve as a helpful community resource. Second, we will use the database to develop new methods for
(1) assessing how potently a small-molecule ligand interacts with its binding pocket and (2) suggesting lead-
optimization strategies tailored to specific proteins. Third, we will create an online system for deploying novel
CADD tools through the web browser, enabling streamlined workflows and enhancing usability. This online
system will further broaden impact by (1) making it easier to translate our browser-based tools into other lan-
guages, (2) ensuring the tools are accessible for those with disabilities, and (3) providing new mentoring
opportunities for students. Finally, through collaborations with partners in academia and industry, we will also
continue to validate our tools by applying them to biologically interesting test proteins."

For decades, the mouse has been the premier animal model for studies of human disease, providing
the opportunity to explore experimental questions that are intractable for direct study in humans. As a
result, key insights have been obtained for a variety of clinical conditions. Spurred by advances in
technology and international efforts to systematically knock out all of the protein coding genes in the
genome, the number of genetically engineered mice has expanded rapidly in the past 20 years. The
responsibility for maintenance and distribution of mutant mice was initially placed on individual
investigators, which was a tremendous burden in terms of cost, labor and space. In 1999, the NIH
recognized the need for a resource to protect the investment in mutant mouse strains and ensure open
access to all biomedical researchers and established the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers
(MMRRC). Since 1999, the central goal of the MMRRC-UNC has been to work collectively with
MMRRC consortium partners to develop and maintain high standards for importation, rederivation,
cryopreservation, and distribution of mutant mouse strains to biomedical investigators. The MMRRC-
UNC will continue to contribute to the goals of the Consortium in the next project period by
implementing the following Specific Aims devoted to continuing its successful role as a cryoarchive and
distribution center and incorporating research goals that synergize with and extend the value of the
resource: 1) Streamline and improve operating procedures to increase importation, distribution, and
cryoarchive of mouse strains. 2) Establish, maintain, and distribute a comprehensive cryoarchive for the
Collaborative Cross (CC) resource. 3) Develop and disseminate computational tools for mouse genetic
QC and genomics research, which will enhance phenotypic reproducibility. 4) Investigate the interaction
of genetics and environment on experimental variability and reproducibility.

10868648,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment. However, ADT has adverse
effects, including cognitive impairment that compromises quality of life for survivors, and increases the risk of
dementia. Neuroimaging studies have shown structural and functional deficits in hippocampus (Hipp), which
mediates spatial cognition, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which mediates executive function, both of
which are compromised after ADT. In previous studies using physically castrated rats as a model of ADT, we
replicated visuospatial and executive deficits seen in ADT patients. Further, we showed that vortioxetine, a novel
antidepressant that improves cognitive impairment in depression, mitigated the effects of ADT. To identify
mechanisms underlying effects of ADT and vortioxetine independent of confounding influences of cancer itself,
we conducted our prior studies in healthy cancer-free Sprague-Dawley rats. However, cancer can affect the
brain indirectly, e.g., by neuroinflammation. Thus, to make this work more translationally relevant, we will now
introduce cancer pathophysiology, using a rat prostate cancer model most suitable for these studies. Dunning
R-3327-G rat prostate cancer cells will be implanted into the flank of Copenhagen rats, with which the Dunning
cells are syngeneic. This will allow us to induce cancer and maintain the rats for a sufficient time to study
mechanisms underlying effects of both ADT and novel therapeutic interventions on cognition, and on neural
structure and function in the mPFC and Hipp. We will monitor tumor progression to ensure that such interventions
do not promote cancer growth or interfere with anti-cancer efficacy of ADT. These goals will be accomplished in
3 specific aims: Aim 1 will assess effects of prostate cancer alone on cognition, IL-6 neuroinflammation, and
neuronal circuit function and structure in the mPFC and Hipp. We focus on IL-6 because of the prominent role
of this inflammatory mediator in prostate cancer pathophysiology, and in compromising neural function and
cognition via oxidative stress. Aim 2 will test effects of ADT by chemical castration with degarelix on cognition,
IL-6 neuroinflammation, neural circuit function, neuronal structure in mPFC and Hipp, and prostate tumor
progression. We will test the role of JAK2, the primary mediator of IL-6 activity, in ADT-induced cognitive
impairment by knocking down JAK2 in mPFC and Hipp. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of 3 drug
candidates: a) first, we will dissect the pharmacological mechanism(s) responsible for vortioxetine's effect, by
testing the antidepressant citalopram , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that lacks other receptor activity, and
ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that lacks reuptake blockade. Both are translation-ready. We will then
test a new neuroprotective drug, P7C3-A20 that enhances NAO+ levels, preventing oxidative stress such as that
produced by IL-6-stimulated JAK2 signaling. In sum, this project will elucidate mechanisms by which ADT impairs
cognition, identify potential therapeutic targets, and establish the Copenhagen rat model as a platform to study
potential treatments for the cognitive impairment that challenges quality of life for prostate cancer survivors."
10782350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Perinatal white matter injury (WMI) is a common sequela of neonatal brain injury. One of the leading causes
of neonatal brain injury and morbidity in premature infants is post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH). PHH is
triggered by germinal matrix and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that results in accumulation of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ventricles. This accumulation of CSF can cause compression of
surrounding brain tissue and injury to the developing white matter. Specifically, in PHH the degree of
ventricular dilation is correlated with severity of WMI as measured by decreased myelination and increased
axonal injury, cellularity, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) has
been previously identified as dependent upon Autotaxin (ATX), which can be sourced via the CSF. The
choroid plexus (ChP) is the tissue which controls the amount and composition of the CSF and therefore helps
instruct the developing nervous system. Here, we examine expression and availability of ChP-secreted ATX
influencing white matter development and myelination of the mouse CNS and hypothesize this may be an
important signaling axis which could be therapeutically harnessed to treat WMI associated with PHH. The
Lehtinen Lab's single nucleus sequencing data demonstrates ATX expression across all epithelial cell
clusters, thereby suggesting the epithelial cells may secrete ATX into the CSF. In preliminary studies we
confirm that the ChP secretes ATX and show that ATX abundance in the ChP and CSF increase throughout
development, with a particularly noticeable upregulation in the critical postnatal window associated with
myelination of the CNS in mouse. In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of ChP-specific ATX modulation on
myelination using advanced in vivo mouse manipulation techniques to selectively delete or overexpress ATX
in the ChP. In Aim 2, I will further explore role for ATX in the pathophysiological mechanisms of WMI using
the lab's translationally relevant mouse model of neonatal PHH following IVH. The results of these studies
will inform our understanding of the mechanisms of hemorrhage induced WMI and will help guide rational
intervention strategies for treatment, thereby improving quality of life for patients and caregivers. The
proposed research will take place at Boston Children's Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Maria Lehtinen, an
expert in the field of choroid plexus and CSF biology, and will provide training in ChP in vivo manipulation
techniques, glial biology, exposure to clinical experience, and in the design of translationally relevant
preclinical studies. We will routinely consult with collaborators and mentors who are experts on both white
matter development and the neurologic sequelae associated with PHH of prematurity. The results from this
proposal will result in first-authored publications and a large body of support for a K99/R00 application, with
the goal of launching an independent academic career."

Early life adversity, also known as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) contribute to poor mental and physical
health outcomes in adulthood in the general population. Research shows that sexual and gender minority (SGM)
adults report more ACEs than heterosexual adults. We argue that it is cisheteronormativity – the societal belief
that everyone is cisgender and heterosexual, that increases risk for exposure to general ACEs, that
cisheteronormativity leads to cisheterosexism – or SGM-identity based discrimination, mistreat and violence
exposure, and that exposure to cisheterosexism in early life should be considered a unique ACE experienced by
SGM populations (SGM-ACEs). In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that exposure to cisheterosexism prior
to adulthood may follow similar biological and neurodevelopmental pathways as exposure to ACEs. We have
developed a first iteration of an SGM-ACEs measure, found that it had good to excellent psychometric properties,
and was associated with proximal and distal minority stress factors in adulthood. However, evidence for SGM-
ACEs impact on mental and physical health outcomes has not been examined rigorously. In addition, our
measure was initially developed from a sample in Bexar County, TX and attention was not given to the potential
differences in experiences at the intersection of sexual and gender identity. To inform future efforts to address
mental and physical health disparities in SGM adults, additional development and testing of SGM-ACEs is
needed, specially using a test-retest design of the measure, more valid and reliable psychological outcome
measures, and an assessment of more objective biomarker measures (e.g., immune function) in adulthood. In
addition, a more thoughtful approach is needed in the development of the next iteration of the measure that
includes identification of the unique experiences of SGM adults outside the geographic boundaries of the original
study, and at the intersection of gender and sexual identity, more specifically across four intersectional SGM
groups: 1. Cisgender monosexuals 2. Gender minority monosexuals 3. Cisgender non-monosexuals 4. Gender
minority (e.g., transgender, non-binary) non-monosexual, and this needs to be followed by an assessment of
measurement equivalence across these four intersectional groups. We propose to: 1. Recruit 15 SGM adults in
each intersectional SGM groups and interview them to identify additional SGM-ACE items related to the
experiences of gender minority individuals, non-monosexual individuals, and SGM adults outside of TX, and to
better understand the perceived impact of SGM-ACEs in early life through adulthood., 2. Use human centered
design methods to co-create SGM-ACEs with community advisory board, and pre-test it with 40 SGM adults and
an expert panel, and 3. Recruit a national sample of 1,844 SGM adults from The PRIDE Study to reach 300
respondents in each the four intersectional SGM groups, use EFA and CFA to identify the number of factors and
multi-group structural equation modelling to test measurement equivalence, and evaluate the criterion validity
of SGM-ACEs II in relation to both psychological measures and immune function biomarkers."

Gynecologic Cancer remains an underfunded area of research with funding to lethality scores significantly lower
than other cancer sites. Endometrial cancer, the most common gynecologic cancer, is one of the few cancers
that has seen an increase in incidence and mortality over the recent years, with black women and minorities
disproportionally affected. Underrepresented populations often develop high risk and rare subtypes of uterine
cancers with distinct molecular profiles. Recent research has identified several molecular subtypes that can be
targeted with novel agents, however, most of these studies have low enrollment of underrepresented populations
who are most likely to have the greatest benefit.
Molecularly driven trials are critical to the progress of personalized medicine to improve survival and limit
exposure to ineffective therapy and associated toxicities. Unfortunately, these highly specialized clinical trials
are at risk of failure due to slow accrual or under-enrollment of the appropriate populations. As the national PI
for NCI/NRG-GY020 (vaginal brachytherapy +/- immunotherapy for early stage high risk mismatch repair
deficient endometrial cancer, which is a subset of endometrial cancer patients who are highly sensitive to
immunotherapy) Dr. Backes is well aware of the opportunities and challenges associated with molecularly driven
clinical trials. NCI support through the R50 mechanism will allow Dr. Backes to increase her efforts to
improve enrollment to clinical trials for all populations, both at her institution and nationally. First,
leveraging the resources of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), Dr. Backes
will develop a comprehensive system for molecular matching to simplify and streamline the identification of
patients for trials and specialized trials for patients, which will increase accrual. Collaborative cross-disciplinary
efforts are especially important with the increasing complexity of molecularly driven clinical trials, such as NCI
ComboMatch and iMatch, and also to improve the outcomes of patients with rare tumor mutations. Secondly,
Dr. Backes will collaborate with Dr. Elektra Paskett to include gynecologic oncology on a recently opened study
“OSU Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials” (1U01CA274999-01). Dr. Backes and Dr.
Ashley Felix (PhD, Epidemiology) will focus on assessing barriers and implement strategies to improve access
to care and clinical trials for underrepresented populations in gynecologic oncology locally and nationally. Finally,
the opportunities afforded by this award will allow Dr. Backes to increase her time to design and support the
development of paradigm shifting clinical trials, and mentor junior investigators in this process, through
her national roles as the NRG Oncology Co-Chair for Developmental Therapeutics, member of the Uterine
Corpus Committee, New Investigator Committee, NCI Uterine Taskforce, national PI for NRG-GY020 and other

The number of Americans aged 65+ living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is
projected to double in the next 30-40 years, particularly for minoritized groups, widening existing
disparities in ADRD. Poor financial wellbeing is a major source of stress, and the cumulative impacts
of financial strain may harm cognition. Life course experiences of financial strain are common,
especially for adults from minoritized groups (e.g., Black Americans) who often also face greater ADRD
burden. Given the pervasiveness of life course financial stressors in the U.S. and growing financial
disparities for groups inequitably burdened by ADRD, there is a critical need to examine how and when
poor financial wellbeing harms cognition and contributes to ADRD risk and disparities over the life
course. The central hypothesis of this application is that poor financial wellbeing across the life course,
particularly starting in early life, increases risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Stress likely plays a role,
as financial hardship causes stress which may accelerate biological aging and, in turn, lead to cognitive
decline. Interventions to improve financial wellbeing would likely reduce ADRD burden, but what such
interventions should be and when they should occur is unclear. Previous research has lacked the
longitudinal data ideally suited to answer these questions. Leveraging three datasets that, together,
span the life course, the scientific objective of this study is to (Aim 1) build a synthetic cohort to examine
(Aim 2) the life course relationship between financial wellbeing and ADRD outcomes and disparities,
(Aim 3) its potential mechanism via biological aging, and (Aim 4) the components and timing of
hypothetical interventions to reduce ADRD burden and disparities associated with poor financial
wellbeing. The proposed work will use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (ages: 12-43), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (ages: 18-60), and the Health
and Retirement Study (ages: 50-100+). The research addresses NIA strategic directions to better
understand social determinants of ADRD across the life span and their mechanisms. Understanding
how and when financial wellbeing most impacts cognition could inform actionable strategies to reduce
ADRD burden, especially among financially disadvantaged groups. Complementing this research plan
is a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background and prior training in life course epidemiology
and foundational causal inference theory and includes new training in 1) applied data fusion and
advanced causal inference techniques, 2) financial wellbeing and social policy, 3) neuroscience and
measurement of ADRD, and 4) biological aging. The strong mentorship team and research and training
plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career investigating the life
course timing and pathways via which socioeconomic stressors harm cognition and impact ADRD risk."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
The Hematopoietic Biorepository and Cellular Therapy Shared Resource (Hematopoietic SR) is an essential 
asset to Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) members' research, illustrated by the breadth of 
scientific program involvement and reflected in the large number of investigators who use this SR. Last year 
alone, over 50 investigators, 51% of whom were Case CCC members, accounting for 68% of total usage, from 
all 7 of the Center’s Programs used the SR. The mission of the Hematopoietic SR is to provide resources and 
services related to the procurement, processing, production, storage, banking, analysis and distribution of cells 
derived from human blood, bone marrow, and umbilical cords. The SR also operates a Clinical Cellular 
Therapy facility that supports clinical-grade cell manufacturing for investigational and standard of care therapy. 
The Specific Aims of the Hematopoietic SR are to: 
 1. Enable access to annotated clinical blood and bone marrow samples to support basic and translational 
 research. An active IRB is maintained to consent and procure blood and bone marrow samples and 
 related case and tissue data from cancer patients and healthy donors for distribution to Case CCC 
investigators. 
 2. Assist users with specialized hematopoietic cell assays. Guidance and services are provided to enable 
 investigators to perform specialized hematopoietic cell assays such as colony assays. 
 3. Support the development and implementation of cellular therapy clinical trials. Support is provided in all 
 aspects of clinical cell therapy, from assisting with regulatory approval to oversight and manufacture of 
 clinical grade cells. 
At last review, the Hematopoietic SR was rated Excellent merit. Throughout the current funding cycle (2012- 
2016), the Hematopoietic SR provided services to 106 registered users, 44 (42%) of whom are Case CCC 
members, representing all 7 of the Case CCC programs. 
The Hematopoietic SR maintains a biorepository of annotated collected samples for use in research and 
assists investigators with specialized hematopoietic assays such as CFU assays and bone marrow-derived 
mesenchymal stem cell isolation. The cellular therapy component of the SR, designated as the Cellular 
Therapy Service, supports clinical cellular therapy activities from the preclinical phase through clinical trial 
implementation. Support capabilities include assistance in the design and preparation of cells for Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) safety studies, navigation of the regulatory pathway, clinical protocol development, 
Investigational New Drug Application (IND) preparation, sourcing of clinical grade supplies and reagents, and 
scale up from research to clinical operations, including preparation of investigational clinical therapy grade 
cellular products."

basis of language by emphasizing the strongest work on the integration of neuroscience research and
communication disorders with cognitive, linguistic, psycholinguistic, perceptual, and motor control models of
speech and language. In this proposal, we aim (1) to support an annual meeting on the Neurobiology of
Language, providing a forum for the interaction of researchers in the full range of allied areas including (a)
basic scientific fields of neuroscience, genetics, psychology, linguistics, mathematics, computation, and
physics; and (b) clinical scientific fields of neurology, neurosurgery, speech/language pathology, and
psychiatry; (2) to expand the breadth of knowledge of researchers in the field by bringing in distinguished
keynote speakers in both general neuroscience and language neuroscience; (3) to advance training and
education in the neurobiology of language by awarding travel and registration scholarships to students and
postdoctoral fellows, and by holding special trainee workshops; and (4) to promote diversity in the field by
providing scholarships for conference attendance to members of groups that are under-represented in the
relevant disciplines, providing childcare services, and supporting translation services for hearing impaired
participants. Because the SNL meeting brings together a broad range of active scientists, clinicians, and
students who do not normally interact regularly, we believe these meetings will lead to valuable new
interactions, collaborations, and novel ideas in the neurobiology of language, including both basic scientific
findings and clinical applications in physiologically-based therapies for neurogenic language disorders."

Lipotoxicity is an important mechanism of complications in type 2 diabetes, including non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). Through a genetic screen, we discovered that loss of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)
embedded within introns of the ribosomal protein L13a (Rpl13a) locus confers resistance to lipotoxicity in a cell
culture model. The four Rpl13a snoRNAs, SNORD32A, SNORD33, SNORD34, and SNORD35A, guide 2¢-O-
methyl nucleotide modifications at five sites on nascent 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs that lie in close proximity
to key functional centers of the ribosome structure. This study will test the hypothesis that knockout of Rpl13a
snoRNAs protects from lipotoxic tissue damage in a mouse model of high fat diet-induced NAFLD. We will define
the mechanistic links among snoRNA abundance, mRNA translation, and dietary nutrient exposures. Findings
from this work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of NAFLD and other diseases of lipid overload

The majority of lived experience depends on neural activity conveying sensory information about the world.
Neural trauma and stroke are leading causes of disorders such as coma and spatial neglect, which severely
damage visual experience, and there are no viable treatment options. Similarly, life saving medical treatments
depend on the ability for general anesthesia to temporarily disconnect patients from the sensory world. Current
anesthetics do so by inhibiting the entire brain, including the brainstem, which is a significant health risk. Even
so, for unknown reasons, general anesthesia sometimes fails to prevent experiences during surgery, resulting
in severe trauma for patients. These problems persist, creating negative health outcomes, in part because
despite substantial research into the mechanisms of sensory encoding, particularly in vision, it remains unclear
how neural activity transforms sensory information into conscious experience. There are many theories, each
suggesting different mechanisms. Visual experience may emerge from the activity of higher-order neural
ensembles, or depend on hidden, complex interactions built into network structures. Experience may involve
local, recurrent network interactions, long-range computations, or global events that subsume and unify network
activity. Unfortunately, concrete evidence supporting any of these theories is limited. Existing technologies lack
either the specificity to identify the microscopic encoding properties of individual neurons and subtypes, or the
necessary scope to detect activity simultaneously across sizable visual networks. New emerging technology in
the Schnitzer lab overcomes these technical limitations. Advanced microscopes and complimentary optical
techniques now make it possible to simultaneously record thousands of neurons across the entire visual network,
with Ca2+ imaging revealing activity related to neural firing, and voltage imaging revealing subthreshold wave
dynamics associated with neural communication. In this project, we will 1.) develop a task designed to isolate
visual experience in mouse models to optimize the benefits of neural recording techniques; 2.) use state-of-the-
art optical instrumentation to resolve the dynamics of thousands of individual neurons of specific types across
all visual cortical areas, characterizing activity patterns that differentiate seen from unseen percepts; 3) use
chemogenetic manipulations to test mechanisms of perception by inhibiting the pulvinar, a subcortical area that
modulates visual networks. The results of this work, as preliminary data supports, will reveal detailed evidence
of neural mechanisms associated with conscious visual perception that can differentiate predictions made by
current theories. This will drive the field towards a data-driven consensus and illuminate mechanisms that will
be instrumental in treating disorders."
10876483,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a long-standing unmet need for innovative brain drug delivery strategies to solve clinical challenges
in the treatment of brain tumors and other central nervous system diseases, which are major public health
problems in the United States. Focused ultrasound combined with microbubble-mediated intranasal
delivery (FUSIN) can address this unmet need by achieving noninvasive, spatially targeted, and efficient drug
delivery to diseased brain sites without jeopardizing healthy brain regions and other organs. FUSIN utilizes the
intranasal route for direct nose-to-brain drug administration, bypassing the BBB and minimizing systemic
exposure. It also uses transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) induced microbubble cavitation (i.e., volumetric
expansion and contraction of the microbubble) to enhance the delivery of IN-administered agents to the FUS-
targeted brain location. We have been supported by NIH/NIBIB (R01EB027223, 4/1/2019–1/31/2023) to develop
FUSIN in mice. The objective of this renewal application is to establish the biophysical mechanism of FUSIN
and obtain compelling large-animal data to support the clinical translation of FUSIN. Our objective will be
achieved by completing the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will establish the biophysical mechanisms of
FUSIN using mouse models; Aim 2 will optimize FUSIN for efficient and safe brain drug delivery in a large animal
model (pigs); Aim 3 will demonstrate the clinical translation potential of FUSIN in a large animal disease model
(pig glioblastoma model). This project is significant because FUSIN has the potential to radically advance the
treatment of a broad spectrum of brain diseases by enhancing therapeutic agent delivery to diseased brain sites,
substantially reducing systemic toxicity, and eliminating the need for invasive surgery. A multidisciplinary team
with expertise in ultrasound engineering, cancer biology, radiochemistry, radiology, and neuro-oncology will
advance FUSIN through the research phase and into future clinical trials. This study has three main innovations:
(1) it proposes a novel mechanism for FUSIN, which is through microbubble cavitation-enhanced glymphatic
transport of intranasal-administered agents; (2) it is the first to scale-up FUSIN from small to large animals; (3)
the pig glioblastoma model provides a unique model that is crucial for obtaining unequivocal evidence in support
of the clinical translation of FUSIN. The proposed research is expected to have a powerful impact on the
research field of brain drug delivery. The outcomes of this project are expected to advance our knowledge of the
biophysical mechanisms underlying microbubble-mediated drug transport in the brain, produce a unique platform
technology for drug delivery in the brain of large animals, and gather large animal data needed to translate
FUSIN into the clinic."

With the aging of the HIV-infected population, and their prolonged exposure to cART regimens that may promote
the development of diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is increasing in patients living with
HIV (PLWH). In two recent studies, we and others have confirmed the additive/synergistic effects of HIV infection
and diabetes on the progression of DKD. Studies have demonstrated that HIV can infect kidney cells, and that
the kidney serves as a reservoir for HIV replication. Recent findings suggest that HIV is present in the kidney
even in cART-treated HIV patients. To determine how chronic HIV infection in patients with low or undetectable
viral load aggravates DKD, we generated a doxycycline-inducible kidney cell-specific HIV transgenic mouse the
expresses low levels of HIV genes. With this model, we confirmed that low level of HIV gene expression did not
cause kidney injury alone. However, aggravated DKD was observed after induction of diabetes, suggesting an
additive/synergistic effect of HIV and diabetes on DKD progression (Feng J. Kidney Int. 2021). For this project,
we will further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which chronic HIV infection induces the progression of
DKD in both mouse models and human patients with HIV to accelerate the discovery of new drug targets and
therapeutics to treat these patients. Toward this goal, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Perform
comprehensive bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing of the kidneys and kidney immune cells from the mice with
both diabetes and low HIV gene expression as compared to control mice, and mice with HIV or diabetes alone.
Aim 2: Perform formalin fixed paraffin embedded slides-based RNA-capture sequencing, scRNA-seq,
immunostaining, and in-situ hybridization of kidneys from patients with DKD alone, and from those with both HIV
infection and DKD. Aim 3: Integrate these datasets together with publicly available datasets to identify gene
expression signatures mediating the additive/synergistic effects of HIV and diabetes on DKD progression. Utilize
the Connectivity Mapping approach to identify potential drugs and small molecules which could reverse these
gene signatures similarly to the approach described in our recent study (Zhang L. Diabetes 2020). Develop a
web-portal to serve and interact with all project data. Aim 4: Validate predicted drugs from aim 3 in the animal
model described in the aim 1. Overall, this project will enable us to identify potential new mechanisms, new drug
targets, and potential new therapeutics to halt the progression of DKD in PLWH."

A large proportion of older adults residing in long term care (LTC) settings, such as nursing homes and assisted
living facilities, suffer from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(ADRD). Apathy is common in persons with AD and ADRD with prevalence rates up to 72%. It is associated with
further cognitive decline, functional deficits, reduced quality of life, social isolation, and increased mortality.
Apathy imposes significant burden on LTC staff and negatively impact quality of care, staff satisfaction and
turnover. Since few pharmacologic options exist, a major strategy is to foster older adults' engagement in social,
physical and cognitive activities, primarily those that are multimodal in nature. However, these interventions often
require significant personnel time and resources, a major concern given the current nursing shortage and high
turnover among LTC nursing personnel. The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates LTC facilities
to provide meaningful engaging activities for residents, which can be resource intensive and are difficult for many
US LTC settings. In order to partially mitigate some of these issues, intervention based on an intelligent socially
assistive robot (SAR) based architecture, called ARIA (Adaptive Robot-mediated Intervention Architecture),
developed under a R21 grant, that can adaptively and dynamically interact with older adults with MCI, AD and
ADRD who reside in LTC settings, is proposed in this grant application. This interdisciplinary proposal is directly
aligned with the NIA goals of understanding and developing effective interventions using smart technology to
reduce the burden of age-related diseases and address the special caregiver needs of those caring for persons
with dementia (PWD). This multi-phase, multi-site, mixed methods clinical trial will systematically examine
responsiveness and engagement among persons with MCI or dementia to two types of SARs (humanoid and
animal), its effect on cognitive, physical and social function as well as the impact of SARs on informal and formal
caregivers with a goal towards future scalability and sustainability. The specific aims of the proposed research
are: Aim 1: To improve our novel social robotic interaction architecture through additional software development
to a) make it more versatile in combining multimodal quantitative data capturing engagement, b) more robust
such that non-experts can operate it and create new tasks by concatenating task primitives, and c) expand tasks
to address varying degrees of cognitive and physical impairments of older adults (Months 1-18). Aim 2: To
compare the effect of usual care (UC) group to UC+ARIA group on reducing apathy among older adults with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild dementia, or moderate dementia (Months 19-48). Aim 3: To identify
barriers and facilitators to SAR implementation across sites to address future scalability and sustainability
(Months 18-42). This study will contribute to the development of improved intelligent technology as an effective
approach to engage older PWD with the long term goal of enhancing function and quality of life."
10784675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Formation, maintenance, and/or modification of myelin is necessary for high order brain functions including
learning, but it is still unclear whether myelin defects contribute to the onset of neurological conditions including
Learning Disabilities (LD), Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Autism Spectrum Disorders
(ASD). As genetic factors are believed to contribute to the onset of these conditions, the overall goal of this study
is to define molecular links for defective myelin/myelination and subnormal learning and memory in a monogenic
disease. Two myelin-centered mouse models of Costello Syndrome (CS) will be used as: CS is caused by mu-
tations in a single gene (HRas); CS patients present with high predisposition to develop LD, ADHD, and ASD in
correlation with abnormal myelin and White Matter (WM); and CS mouse models mimic diverse patient pheno-
types. To test the hypothesis that a CS mutation impairs motor skill learning by disturbing the function and the
timely/accurate formation of myelin, HRasG12V mutation will be induced in Oligodendrocytes (OLs; myelin pro-
ducing cells) and OL Precursor Cells (OPCs) at strategic time points. Preliminary results support that HRasG12V
in pre-existing OLs impairs learning of fine motor skills. Hence, Aim1 involves defining cell-autonomous/non-cell-
autonomous mechanisms regulating this learning phenotype, particularly those linked to increased nitric oxide
(NO) signaling. The Aim 2 will define changes in basal and learning-induced myelination, and functional connec-
tivity upon HRas mutation in OPCs of the developing and adult brain. This study is original and innovative as it
can impact our general understanding of brain function/dysfunction; it will be first in establishing developmental
and chronic roles of HRas as the link for defective myelin and subnormal learning. Drugs studied used here -
targeting glial NO - can diversify and expedite the development of treatments for CS and associated conditions.
Finally, experimental evidence obtained will help settle the long-lasting debate on the links between abnormal
myelin and the neuropathophysiology of RAS/MAPK pathway-related diseases (RASopathies).
 The PI’s expertise is in in vivo glial pathways and behavioral analyses and has been productive in RASopathy
research. To establish a solid research program and become competitive for NIH R01 funding, training goals
include attaining expertise in myelin biology, learning brain-wide research approaches (fcMRI, high-volume brain
imaging), and acquiring a clinical perspective of RASopathies. Therefore, the mentoring team includes 1) a pio-
neer scientist in myelin biology (~30 years in the field), 2) an expert/innovator in rodent MRI brain analyzes, 3) a
leading clinician in RASopathies, and 4) a prosperous intramural scientist to guide the PI’s tenure promotion.
The planned research and training were designed to promote the PI’s independence and to be foundation for an
R01 application aimed toward defining myelin-regulated behaviors upon germline HRas mutation. Additionally,
obtaining collaborations and preliminary data for electrophysiological analyses, behavioral tests of ADHD and
ASD, and transcriptional and epigenomic analysis, among others, are scheduled in the period of support."
10788343,"Abstract/Summary: Administrative (TEEAM) Core 
The Cognitive Neuroscience of Development and Aging (CONDA) Center will be a NIGMS-supported COBRE 
located in Omaha, NE, with a focus on human neuroscience and neuroimaging research across the lifespan. 
The Administrative Core will be essential to the development, support, and evaluation of all major components 
of this Center. Given these responsibilities, the Administrative Core will be known as the Training, Evaluation, 
Engagement, Administration, and Mentoring (TEEAM) Core. The Core will be directed by Dr. Tony Wilson of 
the University of Nebraska Medical Center, with the assistance of a Master’s-level Scientific Administrator. 
Upon establishment of the CONDA Center, the TEEAM Core will launch a series of new and integrated 
programs, each aimed at supporting one or more of its requisite areas. Specifically, the Training area will be 
served by a series of annual neuroimaging and neuromodulation workshops, as well as a postdoctoral fellow- 
ship program. The Evaluation area will be served by research development forums and will use other tools for 
assessing progress and milestone achievement in the junior COBRE PIs. The community Engagement area 
will support two outreach programs, NeuroWow and BrainFit, to engage youth and senior citizens, respectively, 
through organized events that help educate the public, promote STEM interest and careers in the Omaha area, 
and increase the public’s pride in regional science. The youth-oriented NeuroWow program has already been 
active for several years and will be expanded through additional support from the Center, while the BrainFit 
program will be the first of its kind in the region. The Administration area will oversee a Summer Scholars 
program that offers 10-week research internships in the Center to promising undergraduates, administrate a 
Pilot Projects program for faculty and a Mini-Grants program for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students 
that together will award about $180,000 annually, and invest financial and material resources into building a 
participant registry. The Administration area will also host the monthly CONDA Seminar Series, which will bring 
internationally-known cognitive neuroscientists to Omaha to present their latest findings and network with local 
scientists, potentially fostering new collaborations with Center members. Finally, the Mentoring area will use a 
network approach comprised of both academic and technical mentors to help ensure a successful transition of 
the junior COBRE PIs to independent investigators, guide postdoctoral fellows toward faculty positions, and 
assist junior and senior PIs who wish to enter new research areas relevant to the Center. Through these 
targeted programs and a strong network of established mentors and advisors, the TEAAM Core will support 
four junior COBRE research projects led by NIH-defined early-stage investigators (ESI), a state-of-the-art 
Neuroimaging Acquisition and Analysis Core Facility, and a collection of existing extramurally-funded research 
projects led by a team of senior investigators interested in human developmental and aging neuroscience."
10788346,"Abstract/Summary: Neuroimaging Acquisition and Analysis Core 
The Neuroimaging Acquisition and Analysis Core will be the only core facility dedicated to human brain research 
in the state of Nebraska, and the only research core facility of the Cognitive Neuroscience of Development and 
Aging (CONDA) Center. This new Core Facility will provide neuroimaging infrastructure and analysis expertise 
to four institutions concentrated in a narrow stretch of downtown Omaha: the University of Nebraska Medical 
Center (UNMC), the Boys Town National Research Hospital, the University of Nebraska – Omaha, and 
Creighton University. The Core will house a collection of state-of-the-art, research-dedicated neuroimaging and 
neurostimulation equipment, including a 306-sensor magnetoencephalography (MEG) system, a 3.0T Siemens 
Prisma magnet with high-performance gradients and a 64-channel head coil, new electrical and magnetic brain 
stimulation equipment, extensive high-performance computing resources, and other tools for advanced cognitive 
neuroscience research. The associated equipment and space has underwent significant renovations and 
upgrades during the past three years, and already serves a rich community of users comprised of members of 
multiple research programs led by established PIs with significant NIH, NSF, and/or foundation awards. The 
Core will also play a vital role in all four of the primary COBRE research projects, nurture the emergence of 
new research through the Pilot and Mini-Grant programs of the CONDA Center, and host instructional 
workshops and other training events. Thus, the Core’s community of users is expected to significantly increase 
throughout Phase I. The Core Facility will be directed by Dr. Tony Wilson (UNMC) who is an internationally- 
known expert with extensive experience in multimodal imaging, brain stimulation, and advanced data analytics. 
In summary, the combination of cognitive neuroscience, advanced neuroimaging, cognitive development, and 
brain and cognitive aging will create excellent opportunities for synergistic interactions within the new Core 
Facility, and these will spark new research ideas and programs, which will further grow the Core and the 
CONDA Center as a whole."

By 2060, adults 65 years of age and older are predicted to make up 24% of the U.S. population. Therefore, 
factors that impact older adults’ cognitive and emotional health are of significant concern. Of particular 
importance are age-related declines in specific subtypes of empathy. These declines greatly impact public 
health because reduced empathy has been associated with numerous mental health conditions, including 
increased depression and loneliness. It is important to note that reduced empathy not only affects healthy older 
adults, but also appears to be selectively affected in specific age-related neurological disorders such as fronto- 
temporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, characterizing the mechanisms underlying age-related 
declines in the subtypes of empathy could provide key information to develop targeted interventions that could 
have a major impact on aging-related diseases, as well as the many other patient populations affected by low 
empathy (e.g., autism, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury). 
Current research suggests that there are two subtypes of empathy (i.e., cognitive and emotional) and that 
healthy older adults show significant declines in the cognitive subtype of empathy (i.e., understanding others’ 
thoughts and feelings), with preserved or enhanced function in the emotional subtype (i.e., feeling compassion 
for others). These declines in cognitive empathy have been linked to neural changes in regions associated with 
thinking about others’ mental states, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, there is evidence 
suggesting that declines in cognitive empathy may be at least partially attributable to age-related deficits in 
other cognitive functions, such as executive function and memory. However, little is known on the neural bases 
of preserved emotional empathy in older adults, and the trajectory of neural and behavioral function underlying 
each empathy subtype has never been examined across the adult lifespan. Furthermore, while previous 
studies have focused on relationships with chronological age, they have not measured the link to biological 
age, which has been shown to be a more accurate marker of the physiological impacts of lifespan stressors 
and is predictive of disease risk and all-cause mortality. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal will 
investigate the trajectory of age-related changes in the cognitive and emotional subtypes of empathy through 
behavioral and functional neuroimaging methods. Participants will include 116 healthy adults ranging in age 
from 25-75 years of age. Gold standard cognitive and emotional empathy tasks will be used to probe age- 
related behavioral changes, and functional MRI will be used to assess neural changes, in both intrinsic networks 
and task-based activation during empathy tasks. Aging will be assessed using both chronological and biological 
aging (based on DNA methylation) metrics to provide a more precise quantification of the aging process. The 
results of this proposal will lay the groundwork for the development of interventions designed to target specific 
subtypes of empathy, with widespread implications for the clinical populations experiencing reduced empathy."

Cortical circuit dysfunction is a primary pathophysiology that underlies prominent neurological symptoms of
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Yet the precise way in which circuit development in the cortex is altered in FXS
has not been fully elucidated. Recent work by us, and others, has established that local circuit interneurons
(INs) may be a key to understanding cortical circuits in FXS. We demonstrated that the density, maturity
and activity of parvalbumin (PV) cortical INs are all reduced in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of
FXS. Here we propose to address outstanding questions in the field by determining how the birth, migration
and connectivity of PV INs are disrupted in Fmr1 KO mice, and how this leads to sensory hypersensitivity
and tactile defensiveness. We will incorporate a detailed analysis of PV INs using birth dating,
neuroanatomical and functional studies to define how the abnormal integration of PV INs into feedforward
circuits in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contributes to atypical sensory processing. In preliminary
studies, we demonstrate that, in response to repetitive whisker stimulation, Fmr1 KO mice display
maladaptive avoidance behaviors that correlate with a lack of neuronal adaptation of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal
neurons in S1. We also show that PV INs and their precursors from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)
are hypoactive in S1 of Fmr1 KO mice by postnatal day (P) 6, and that increasing their activity for a few
days using excitatory DREADDs significantly increases their density by P15. We will now determine whether
similar early activity manipulations of MGE-derived INs, or later on in more mature PV INs, can restore the
loss of sensory adaptation of L2/3 neurons and ameliorate tactile defensiveness in Fmr1 KO mice. We will
address the following important questions: 1. What are the contributions of neurogenesis, migration,
connectivity and developmental apoptosis to the reduced density of PV INs in FXS? 2. How do MGE-derived
INs and pyramidal neurons interact during the early postnatal critical period and how is their ‘handshake’
different in FXS? 3. Is the hypoactivity of PV INs or their precursors causal to the circuit and behavior deficits
of Fmr1 KO mice? The mechanistic experimental design employs cell type-specific intersectional genetics,
in vivo calcium imaging, chemogenetics, and ex vivo circuit channel-rhodopsin connectivity mapping, among
others. An important goal of this grant is to identify whether targeting INs is a viable path for therapeutics in
FXS. As such a novel class of allosteric modulating drugs of Kv3.1 channels (responsible for fast-spiking
characteristics of PV INs) will be tested in Fmr1 KO mice. Overall, the collaboration between the laboratories
of Dr. Carlos Portera-Cailliau (co-PI, PL) at UCLA and Dr. Anis Contractor (co-PI) at Northwestern University
will enable a comprehensive approach to understanding the developmental and functional contributions of
INs to the pathophysiology of FXS."
10788341,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The uncertainty surrounding expected outcomes at periviable gestation leads to several major
challenges. First, clinicians may be unsure of how to counsel families. Second, the lack of clarity makes
families more anxious and causes trauma. Third, it is difficult for both clinicians and families to make the most
informed decisions for the neonate. This is important because making a decision to resuscitate when there are
very poor chances for a good outcome could lead to a futile attempt at resuscitation leading to death, or
potentially a survivor that has severe neurodevelopmental disability. On the other hand, making a misinformed
decision to not resuscitate and proceed to comfort care when there is a good chance of survival without
disability could be even more tragic.
 We will develop and test a modern, comprehensive predictive model for outcomes at periviable
gestation using an existing infrastructure for data collection and implementation, the California Perinatal Quality
Care Collaborative (CPQCC). This population-based network of neonatal intensive care units includes both
academic and community units, which means that results will be generalizable. CPQCC already has an
existing data infrastructure that includes maternal and neonatal data, including follow-up data at 2 years of age,
giving an opportunity to study outcomes that do not exist in similar networks. The setting of the CPQCC allows
for a unique opportunity to both improve on current prediction tools, and to implement and evaluate the
prediction tool in a real-world setting.
 In Aim 1, we will build a predictive model for outcomes in periviable gestation using the most up-to-date
data possible using a broad population-based cohort. This model will be used to build an on-line estimator that
will be used by 20 hospitals across California. In Aim 2, we will evaluate how current practice across ~140
California neonatal intensive care units align with prognostic estimates from the models built in Aim 1. In this
Aim, we will evaluate whether certain patient level factors and hospital level factors appear to fall outside the
norms of typical practice in relationship to prognosis, for therapies provided to the mother prior to birth, and the
infant after birth. In Aim 3, we will implement usage of the estimator across California neonatal intensive care
units in waves of 20 hospitals each over a 1 ½ year period. We will then compare if and how practices change
for periviable gestation infants. In Aim 4, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of implementing this
estimator in clinical practice. This research will fill several gaps in our knowledge of the use of prediction
models for periviable birth, particularly the gap in our understanding of how using an estimator in practice may
influence and improve clinical decisions and outcomes."
10765242,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hundreds of human proteins contain prion-like domains (PrLDs), defined as protein domains that are
compositionally similar to yeast prion domains. In recent years, a growing number of PrLDs in various
organisms have been shown to form functional assemblies that regulate various cellular activities. These
assemblies vary in both complexity and material states, from highly stable amyloid aggregates that can act as
a form of cellular memory to complex, reversible biomolecular condensates such as stress granules.
Additionally, mutations in PrLDs have been linked to various degenerative disorders, including amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Disease-associated mutations tend to increase the aggregation
propensity of the PrLDs. This observation has led to the hypothesis that many PrLDs are designed to mediate
dynamic reversible interactions involved in cellular regulation, and that mutations alter the dynamics of these
assemblies, promote the conversion to more stable structures, or cause aberrant aggregation of the PrLDs.
However, while PrLDs are highly over-represented in eukaryotic genomes, the functions of only a small fraction
of PrLDs have been characterized. Our long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
roles of PrLDs in normal physiology and in disease. Towards this end, we are examining the basis for
recruitment of PrLDs to complex assemblies such as stress granules, examining how specificity of targeting is
achieved between different assemblies, and characterizing novel functions of these domains. Collectively,
these studies will provide a framework for understanding the diverse functions of PrLDs."
10766699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Biomolecular condensates are dynamic, membraneless compartments that spatiotemporally regulate a
myriad of cellular functions from gene transcription to cellular stress response. Liquid-liquid phase
separation (LLPS) is increasingly appreciated as the biophysical mechanism for how these condensates
assemble. Key to proper condensate function is the maintenance of their dynamics and
assembly/disassembly processes, but little is known about these mechanisms. Hints are provided from
disease states whereby condensates may undergo liquid-to-solid transitions into cytoplasmic inclusions
that contain protein quality control components and are characteristic of proteinopathies such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We have identified UBQLN2, a member of ubiquitin-mediated protein
quality control systems, as a contributor to condensate function. We recently showed that UBQLN2 forms
condensates in vitro, and is recruited to stress granules, cytoplasmic condensates that form in response
to stress. The multitude of UBQLN2 functions are driven through interactions with proteasomal subunits,
polyubiquitin chains, and client proteins. Ubiquitin and polyubiquitin, biological signals for the
maintenance of protein homeostasis through degradation and autophagy, drive disassembly of UBQLN2
condensates in vitro. These observations have broad implications for how phase separation mechanisms
regulate the function of protein quality control systems. In this project, we aim to identify the molecular
and cellular mechanisms that drive how UBQLN2 condensates assemble and disassemble. Aim 1
determines how domain-domain interactions promote or inhibit phase separation of UBQLN2 via
construction of phase diagrams for constructs from a combination of UBQLN2 domain deletion and
disease-linked mutations. These domain deletions will be used to mimic the different “states” of UBQLN2
when specific domains are engaged with binding partners and unable to contribute to LLPS. We will use
UBQLN2 disease-linked mutations as a nature-provided library to elucidate how intra- and intermolecular
UBQLN2 interactions promote or inhibit condensate assembly and alter condensate morphology and
material properties both in vitro and in mammalian cell culture models. Aim 2 quantifies how UBQLN2
condensates are affected by UBQLN2 engagement with protein quality control components, including
proteasomal receptors, client proteins, and different types of polyubiquitin chains. We monitor these
effects in vitro and with designed mutants in vivo. Importantly, we develop a reconstituted UBQLN2
condensate model to quantify the parameters of how polyubiquitin and polyubiquitinated substrates
engage with UBQLN2 to disassemble condensates. These studies will lay the foundation for determining
the physiological roles of phase separation as it pertains to protein homeostasis through ubiquitin-
mediated pathways."

AKT is one of the most important protein kinases in insulin signaling. In response to insulin, AKT becomes
active and phosphorylates critical metabolic effectors, including TBC1D4, GSK3, TSC2, and FOXO. These
proteins regulate glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma
membrane, glycogen synthesis, lipid and protein synthesis, and glucose production in adipose tissues, skeletal
muscles, and livers. Abnormalities in AKT activation have been linked to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.
AKT is activated by two other protein kinases, mTORC2 and PDK1. mTORC2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic
motif of AKT and opens the catalytic domain. PDK1 then phosphorylates AKT to activate its enzymatic activity.
The activation step by PDK1 is controlled by the recruitment of AKT and PDK1 to the plasma membrane.
However, understanding of how mTORC2 is regulated to phosphorylate AKT is limited. To fill this critical
knowledge gap, this grant application tests the hypothesis that KRAS4B, RHOA, and mTORC2 form a
supercomplex (termed KARATE) to direct the enzymatic activity of mTORC2 toward AKT in insulin signaling.
Toward this goal, we will identify the mechanism, localization, and regulation of the KARATE assembly. We will
also determine the physiological function of KARATE in glucose homeostasis. We will employ multiple
innovative tools, including: 1) our recently developed total biochemical reconstitution system for KARATE-
mediated AKT phosphorylation; 2) a Dictyostelium bioreactor that enables the purification to functional human
proteins to high homogeneity with critical post-translational modification; 3) our novel KARATE peptide inhibitor
for in vitro and cellular studies; 4) our CRISPR-generated knockout cell lines for RHOA, KRAS and mTORC2
subunits; and 5) tissue-specific RHOA-knockout mice and phospho-defective RHOA mice. We anticipate that
the successful completion of the work will significantly advance our understanding of insulin signaling and
establish a solid foundation for future studies. Ultimately, this will help translate the fundamental biology of AKT
signaling into medical treatments focused on KARATE for metabolic syndrome."
10767238,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as normal aging, are associated with a wide range of brain
and cognitive changes. In investigating cognitive changes, it has been observed that some
people can sustain more brain changes or pathology than others, and this differential
susceptibility is related to measures such as IQ, education, vocational experiences etc. This
observation is the basis for the cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis, where CR moderates the
effects of brain changes on cognition. Recent developments in medical imaging, particularly
multimodal neuroimaging, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie
both cognitive changes and the role of CR. However, existing statistical methods were not
designed to accommodate large-scale multi-dimensional data, particularly for incorporating
high-dimensional moderators and mediators. To address these issues, we propose to develop,
validate, and apply software tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of multimodal
MR brain images and cognitive data acquired from individuals with normal cognitive aging,
preclinical AD and AD from two independent studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease: the
Reference Ability Neural Networks (RANN) (Yaakov Stern, PI) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We will demonstrate that the developed statistical methods offer
improved accuracy and robustness over current tools. First, we will develop tools for identifying
robust relationships between neurodegeneration or pathology markers and brain function
(network expression measured by task fMRI) in the presence of CR as a moderator. Second,
we will derive neural substrate of CR using resting-state functional MRI and task fMRI and then
develop statistical tools to test the moderation effect of the imaging CR proxies. Third, we will
develop the sparse moderated mediation methods for high-dimensional predictors and
mediators accounting for moderation. to test whether network expression during cognitive tasks
mediates the effect of brain changes (measured via multimodal structural MRI) on cognitive
performance, cognitive decline and dementia transition, and whether the derived neural
substrate of CR moderates the mediation."

At the 2022 Photosensory Receptors and Signal Transduction (PRST) Gordon Research Conference (GRC) to
be held in Ventura CA, scientists from all over the world gather to present and discuss the full palette of
photosensory systems that Nature has provided, aiming to understand their mechanisms, signaling pathways
and functional effects – from the level of atoms and molecules to that of the physiology of organisms and the
ecosystems that they constitute. Photosensory receptors provide unique opportunities to understand the
essential principles of signal transduction and protein function because they can be activated by light, rendering
them amenable to state-of-the-art physical, chemical and cell-biological approaches. In this way, the central
question of how light-induced molecular changes produce large-scale biological signals can be addressed in
unprecedented detail. Research of photosensory signaling has enormous practical application. In the case of
vertebrate vision, loss of the finely tuned regulation of the phototransduction pathway has been linked to various
types of retinal degeneration that cause conditions such as night blindness, tunnel vision, and even the total loss
of sight. Studies of phototransduction in the eye also lead to the treatment of retinal diseases, circadian
dysfunction and mood disorders. The modular architecture of photosensory systems in combination with their
genetic encodability provides the foundation for the field of optogenetics, wherein photoreceptors and their
interaction pathways are engineered to noninvasively control cellular processes with light. Research on
photosensory receptors is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring basic scientific advances on several fronts. The
themes of the GRC and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) have been chosen to represent the
key interdisciplinary problems in the field and to stimulate the exchange of ideas between a diverse group of
researchers. Emerging directions such as the impact of new technologies for understanding receptor
photophysics and mechanism, the role macromolecular complexes in transducing complex photonic responses,
such as those of vertebrate vision, and the engineering of photosensors for optogenetics will be explored in
depth. Invited speakers will include both established and early-stage investigators. In addition, poster presenters
will compete for short hot-topic talks. The GRS provides a supportive environment for junior scientists to present
their work and receive advise by senior mentors. The PRST community has long supported junior scientists, and
the GRS will continue to help us nurture the development of early-stage investigators and promote diversity
within our community. The field of photosensory transduction has been undergoing a revitalization due to an
influx of talented new researchers who apply advanced tools of biophysics, computation, single molecule or cell
imaging and high-throughput screening methods to provide answers previously unattainable. The well-integrated
PRST GRC/GRS will scientists to the most important questions confronting our field and will encourage postdocs
and students to apply their hard-won training to the most exciting new areas of photobiology."

 Proper spatial and temporal control of gene expression during development of the cerebral cortex is
critical for the maintenance of neural progenitors and for neural differentiation. While transcriptional regulation
has long been recognized as critical to the control of gene expression during cortical development, the
contribution of RNA decay is less well understood. Despite this, mis-regulation regulation of gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level is emerging as a major cause of neurodevelopmental diseases, including intellectual
disability and autism. CNOT3, a regulator of mRNA stability, has recently been found to be mutated in a cohort
of patients suffering from intellectual disability and autism. Additional studies have shown that CNOT3 regulates
the stability of transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and stem cell fate. Despite the links
between Cnot3, mRNA degradation, neurodevelopmental disease, how Cnot3 contributes to brain development,
and its key targets in this process, are unknown. I will address this knowledge gap using a Cre-lox conditional
knockout mouse model to ablate Cnot3 expression in neural progenitors. Preliminary data indicates that at
embryonic day (E)14.5 (approximately mid-neurogenesis), cKO mice exhibit microcephaly, apoptosis, and a
reduction in the number of actively proliferating cells. In this proposal, I will build upon these observations and
test the overall hypothesis that that CNOT3-mediated regulation of mRNA stability is required for proper cortical
development. Aim 1 investigates the impact of Cnot3 disruption across corticogenesis, and uses live imaging
approaches to monitor the requirements for CNOT3 in progenitor fate decisions. Aim 2 uses state-of-the-art
technology to globally monitor mRNA stability in neural progenitors and assess the consequences of Cnot3
deletion on mRNA stability. These approaches will reveal previously uncharacterized role for CNOT3 in cortical
development, while providing an unprecedented view of RNA stability during cortical development, and how its
mis-regulation contributes to disease."

 This is a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award submitted to the National
Institute on Aging by Robert Tyler Braun, an Instructor in the Department of Population Health Sciences
at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Braun's career goal is to become an independent
researcher on improving end-of-life care for the elderly by assessing various policy interventions and
delivery models of hospice care. This K01 application will provide Dr. Braun with the necessary training
1) to gain expertise in aging and hospice research; 2) to understand clinical care for hospice patients;
and 3) to gain methodological skills to conduct qualitative studies related to hospice delivery and care.
 Dr. Braun has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers from WCMS and
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (VUSM): Dr. Lawrence Casalino (primary mentor) who is the
Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health at WCMC and an expert on health care organization and
behavior, and qualitative methods; Dr. Holly Prigerson (co-mentor) who is the Irving Sherwood Wrights
Professor of Geriatrics at WCMC and an expert on end-of-life care; Dr. David Stevenson (co-mentor) who
is a professor and the holder of the Endowed Directorship in Health Policy Education at VUMC and an
expert in the delivery of hospice care; and Dr. Mark Unruh (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor in
the Department of Population Health Sciences at WCMC with expertise in long-term care and Medicare
claims data.
 Over the past couple of decades, the hospice industry has moved from largely a not-for-profit
sector to predominately for-profit. Facilitated by relatively easy market entry and generous Medicare
payments, PE firms and PTCs have been acquiring hospices (many of them non-profit), with the goal to
deliver short-term, above market returns to their investors. Despite this emergence, little is known of its
effect on hospice care. Building on his previous research and training on assessing this phenomenon in
physician practices, Dr. Braun will identify the organizational, staffing, patient, and quality
characteristics associated with PE and PTC acquisitions using publicly available hospice data from Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (Aim 1), use rigorous econometric methods to assess the
effect PE and PTC acquisition on hospice care using patient-level Medicare claims (Aim 2), and use
qualitative methods to assess organizational, cultural, and delivery aspects of hospices post-acquisition
integration (Aim 3). This research will be a foundation for an R01 grant application and will incorporate
the new skills acquired through his training, which inform opportunities for improvement in hospice
delivery of care."
10779887,"Under-diagnosis occurs when an individual living with a disease condition has not
received a diagnosis. Reasons for under-diagnosis are often complex and context
specific, and the extent may vary across sensible population subgroups leading to
disparity in care. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wealth of health
information for patients, and the diagnosed and under-diagnosed patients may bear
similarity in their EHR profiles, which differ from those condition-free. Therefore,
EHRs provide a unique opportunity to address under-diagnosis in the standard
healthcare setting. Full exploitation of such opportunity is challenging, however,
because of the very fact that under-diagnosed patients are embedded in the large
number of condition-free patients. Noting that patients who have been diagnosed
with the condition can be identified from EHRs, we propose that EHR data, when
enriched with additional disease labels from a small scale targeted screening, allows
development of data-driven approaches to identifying under-diagnosed patients and
assessing disparity in under-diagnosis. To this end, we will develop an arsenal of
statistical and machine learning methods and accompanying software tools to
address under-diagnosis. Our methods enable (1) a risk-based approach to
identifying patients in EHRs who most possibly miss the diagnosis (Aim 1); (2)
unbiased comparison between diagnosed and under-diagnosed patients to
understand disparity in under-diagnosis (Aim 2); and (3) leveraging of existing
models and targeted screening data to address under-diagnosis in a new clinical
setting. We will apply the developed methods to address under-diagnosis in Primary
Aldosteronism and Familial Hypercholesterolemia using data from Penn Medicine
and VA EHRs."

Sepsis-associated multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) affects approximately 1 in every 6 children
admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the U.S. and is associated with about 1 in every 3 PICU
deaths. Despite this, the current management approach for pediatric sepsis and sepsis-associated MODS and
the use of adjuvant therapies remains highly variable in the PICU. This is in part due to the heterogeneity of
sepsis and the high variability in which it presents and evolves in children. This heterogeneity can delay the
recognition of sepsis and the early identification of patients at high risk of poor outcomes, and has limited the
development of targeted interventions. Unraveling this heterogeneity and identifying high-risk sepsis
phenotypes with prognostic and therapeutic relevance is considered a major research priority in the path
towards precision medicine in sepsis. However, for precision medicine strategies to be most clinically impactful
for children with sepsis, it is critical that they are implementable in real-time, generalizable to more settings,
and cost-effective. This would enable timely enrollment in enriched randomized controlled trials and initiation of
targeted interventions with potential for higher public health impact. We previously identified and characterized
the persistent hypoxemia and shock phenotype in critically ill children with sepsis-associated MODS using a
data-driven approach. This phenotype was present in almost a third of children with sepsis-associated MODS,
had features of systemic inflammation and endothelial activation, was highly reproducible, and was
independently associated with mortality, accounting for more than two-thirds of all deaths in this population.
Furthermore, in a causal inference analyses, patients with persistent hypoxemia and shock were associated
with a higher likelihood to benefit from intravenous hydrocortisone and albumin when compared to other
patients. Importantly, phenotypes with similar characteristics in terms of hypoxemia, shock, inflammation, and
endothelial activation has been identified in prior studies of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome in
children and adults. However, the persistent hypoxemia and shock phenotype currently requires longitudinal
data for up to 72 hours to be classified, so there is a need to determine whether it can be predicted early in the
course using routinely collected clinical data. Furthermore, amongst patients who achieve a high probability of
having the phenotype, there is a need to determine which common adjuvant therapies are associated with
heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) in order to inform future clinical trials. In this study we aim to: (1) Derive
and externally validate a prediction model of persistent hypoxemia and shock in children admitted to the PICU
with confirmed or suspected infection; (2) Determine which common adjuvant therapies and therapeutic goals
are associated with HTE amongst children with high probability of having persistent hypoxemia and shock; and
(3) Implement and prospectively evaluate the performance of the prediction model of persistent hypoxemia and
shock in the EHRs of three institutions."
10781201,"Pleural fibrosis is the scarring of the pleura resulting in restrictive lung disease and impaired lung function. The
pathophysiological mechanism of pleural fibrosis is unclear. The interactions between resident and
inflammatory cells, profibrotic mediators and coagulation factors, and fibrinolytic pathways are integral to
pleural remodeling and fibrosis. Increasing evidence affirm the critical role of pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs)
in pleural fibrosis development, mainly through a process termed mesothelial to mesenchymal transition
(MesoMT). MesoMT is characterized by increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)/collagen 1
(Col-1)/fibronectin (FN), and enhanced cell migration/invasion. Currently, there are no pharmacologic
treatments for this disease. Therefore, identification of novel targets and therapeutic strategies is an important
goal for the public health. However, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in mechanisms controlling MesoMT
during pleural fibrosis. Our preliminary data strongly support that dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a
crucial regulator of MesoMT to promote pleural fibrosis. In primary human PMCs (HPMCs), DOCK2 was
induced by the potent MesoMT inducer TGF-β. DOCK2 knockdown blocked TGFβ-induced MesoMT maker
expression and cell migration. Snail as a transcriptional factor controlling epithelial to mesenchymal transition
was found critical in TGF-β-induced MesoMT. DOCK2 knockdown inhibited TGF-β-induced Snail expression
and activation of Smad2/3 and NF-κB signaling, which have been shown to upregulate Snail expression in
various cell types. DOCK2 knockdown also suppressed TGF-β-induced Rac1 activation in HPMCs. In addition,
we found that DOCK2 was dramatically induced in the fibrotic pleura of human pleuritis patients and in pleural
fibrosis models induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep), carbon black/bleomycin (CBB), and TGF-β.
DOCK2 knockout mice were significantly protected from Strep-induced pleural fibrosis. Based on these
findings, our overall hypothesis is that DOCK2 mediates MesoMT and increases PMC migration/invasion to
promote pleural fibrosis, which will be tested in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if DOCK2
promotes pleural MesoMT via upregulation of Snail. Further, we will test whether DOCK2 increases Snail
through activating Smad2/3 and NF-κB signaling. In Aim 2, we will test if DOCK2 promotes pleural MesoMT
with increased cell migration/invasion. Specifically, we will determine if DOCK2 mediates TGF-β-induced
cytoskeletal reorganization, migration, and invasion via activating Rac1. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that DOCK2 knockout blocks pleural fibrosis via inhibiting MesoMT in vivo. We will determine if general and
mesothelial cell-specific DOCK2 knockout mice are protected from Strep, CBB, and TGF-β induced pleural
fibrosis through suppressing MesoMT in vivo. Completion of the proposed studies will establish the pivotal role
and mechanisms of DOCK2 in promoting pleural fibrosis by regulating MesoMT, which may ultimately
contribute to the identification of novel targeted therapies for this important but refractory clinical problem."
10780944,"Viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon (IFN) inducible) is
an interferon inducible protein that inhibits and/or is involved in the restriction of a remarkable
range of both RNA and DNA viruses1-3. Viperin is a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine
(RS) superfamily of enzymes, all of which possess an oxygen-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster that is
indispensable for catalytic activity. The mechanisms by which this 42 kDa enzyme elicits broad-
spectrum antiviral activity remained a mystery until we recently discovered that viperin catalyzes
the conversion of CTP to 3ʹ-deoxy-3′,4ʹ-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) through a radical-based
mechanism. ddhCTP is a previously undescribed ribonucleotide, which acts as a chain terminator
in vitro against several flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRP), including Dengue
(DNV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika virus. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ddhCTP inhibited
Zika virus replication in vivo. The discovery of ddhCTP provided, for the first time, a potential
mechanism for some of viperin’s antiviral activities. However, one important caveat is that
picornavirus RDRPs are not sensitive to ddhCTP, despite viperin serving as a restriction factor
for these microbes. Viperin has also been implicated in several additional cellular processes
important for viral replication and innate immunity, including cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid b-
oxidation, protein turnover and ribosomal protein translation. These observations underly our
major driving hypothesis that ddhCTP possesses additional critical roles in cellular metabolism
that impact viral replication as well as other physiological processes. The objectives of this
proposal are to provide biochemical, structural, and mechanistic insights into the roles that
ddhCTP plays in the broader context of viperin-related functions."

While expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage over the past two decades has significantly decreased
mother-to-child, or “vertical,” transmission, progress has stagnated in recent years. To address the remaining
130,000 new infections among children each year, we must take a broader approach, promoting maternal ART
coverage within the context of additional interventions. The key question is, which additional interventions
will most benefit elimination of mother-to-child transmission (eMTCT) efforts while also being
economically feasible for a country to implement? Simulation-based modeling and decision science have
played an important role in evaluating the benefits and costs of HIV treatment and prevention strategies, in order
to inform guidelines and policy decisions. We propose to apply these methods to guide eMTCT health policy in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of infant infections occur. Most decision science work in this area has
focused on adult HIV, while the limited number of eMTCT studies have largely focused on interventions
downstream of ART initiation, despite the potential for interventions upstream of ART initiation to have significant
impact. We have identified an eMTCT toolbox of six interventions that span the entire reproductive continuum,
from preconception to postpartum: access to contraception to more safely time pregnancies, pre-exposure
prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection among pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBFW), HIV re-testing to
ensure prompt ART initiation among PBFW who acquire HIV, and long-acting ART, mentor mother programs,
and viral load testing to increase viral suppression rates among PBFW who initiate ART. Implementing all six
interventions at full-scale is ideal but not feasible given resource limitations. To identify implementation priorities,
we will evaluate the population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each of these interventions, alone
and in different combinations or “portfolios” of various sizes. Because the cost-effectiveness and affordability of
an intervention will depend on country-specific factors, including economic resources, demographics, epidemic
characteristics, and eMTCT progress to date, we will tailor our evaluation to the specific country contexts of
Kenya, Nigeria, and Botswana. These three African countries all have a high HIV burden but also represent
diversity in key relevant characteristics, making them useful case studies for a wide range of other African
countries. Our findings from this comprehensive eMTCT intervention analysis will provide urgently-needed
support for eMTCT policymaking in each of our three focus countries, paving the way for a new frontier in eMTCT
progress in these and other African settings."

Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is a high-risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which leads
to a high rate of disability or death. However, the treatment options for patients are severely limited, primarily
relying on surgical methods that possibly cause intraoperative hemorrhage or even death. No pharmacologic
treatment is available, primarily because of the poor understanding of the mechanisms in bAVM
pathophysiology. Clinical studies have recently found endothelial cell (EC)-specific somatic
activating KRAS mutations in up to 76% of sporadic bAVMs, which account for over 95% of bAVM cases. By
KRASG12V overexpression in mouse brain ECs, we confirmed that KRAS mutation is sufficient for bAVM
development and established a novel animal model of bAVM that displayed salient features of human bAVM.
While the underlying mechanism by which KRAS mutation causes bAVM development remains to be defined,
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) acquire
mesenchymal characteristics, has been implicated in human bAVMs. We found the bAVM in our mouse model
also demonstrated increased prototypic EndMT markers (CD44, KLF4, TGFβ, Notch, and MMPs) as well as
high intensity of α-SMA and CD44 localized on ECs in the bAVMs. We also confirmed that KRASG12V induced
EndMT characteristics in cultured ECs (increased mesenchymal markers but reduced EC markers). Earlier
studies have implicated calpains (a family of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases) as critical modulators of
EndMT. Calpains degrade junction proteins or negative regulators of EndMT. In addition, calpain inhibition
attenuates the lung or cardiac EndMT. KRAS mutation modulates ERK activation and Ca2+ influx, the
regulators of calpain expression and activation. Supportively, we found significantly higher levels of calpain-1
and -2 in cultured ECs overexpressing KRASG12V, as well as increased calpain-2 in bAVMs from KRASG12V
mice. We also confirmed that PD150606 (an inhibitor of calpain-1 and -2) reduced (1) EndMT marker, CD44 in
cultured ECs overexpressing KRASG12V and (2) the number of bAVM and ICH in KRASG12V mice. Based on the
evidence, we hypothesized that Calpain(s)-mediated EndMT in KRAS mutant EC leads to bAVM formation
and bAVM-associated ICH. To test the hypothesis, we will address 1) the detailed mechanism and role of
calpains in mediating EndMT that advances bAVM/ICH development and 2) the mechanism by which mutant
KRAS-induced EndMT derives bAVM development. Our ultimate goal is to develop intervention strategies for
the treatment of bAVM and bAVM-associated complications. Upon successful completion of the proposed
study, we will provide a novel mechanism in bAVM pathophysiology and potential targets to treat bAVM
patients."
10763005,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In recent years, it has become apparent that both innate and adaptive immunity contribute to the genesis of
hypertension. We have discovered a novel mechanism that underlies activation of adaptive immunity in
hypertension, involving the formation of isolevuglandins (isoLGs) in dendritic cells (DCs) and other antigen
presenting cells. These lipid oxidation products adduct to proteins, resulting in formation of neoantigens that
are processed and presented by major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). IsoLG-modified proteins are
increased in DCs of both mice and humans with hypertension and drive proliferation of subsets of T cells,
particularly CD8+ T cells. In this research program, we are examining mechanisms responsible for formation of
isoLGs in DCs. We have evidence that isoLGs are formed as a result of both NADPH oxidase activation and
by reactive oxygen species generated by the mitochondria in DCs. Using unique mice we have made we are
defining potential immunogenic peptides presented in MHC class 1 and determining if there are different
peptides derived from mitochondria versus non-mitochondrial sources. Mass spectroscopy will also be
employed to determine if similar isoLG modified peptides are presented by monocytes of humans with
hypertension. In parallel studies performed in collaboration with Dr. Simon Mallal, the director of the
Translational Immunology Core at Vanderbilt, we are characterizing the alpha and beta chain sequences of T
cell receptors (TCRα and TCRβ) in activated T cells of both mice and humans using single cell sequencing.
This will allow us to produce surrogate T cells (transfectomas) that can be used to determine their
responsiveness to isoLG-modified proteins and peptides presented in MHC class 1 of hypertensive mice. We
have recently shown that hypertensive humans have a striking increase in circulating memory T cells that
produce IL-17A and IFN-γ compared to matched controls. Data from single cell sequencing will identify the
TCRα and TCRβ of these cells and to produce transfectomas expressing these sequences and to determine if
they are also responsive to isoLG modified proteins presented in the context of APCs from the same individual.
Identifying specific neoantigens in hypertension will provide an enormous advance in understanding this
disease. These could serve as biomarkers of disease severity and be used to detect pathogenic T cells in
hypertension. Ultimately immunization approaches could be employed to treat or prevent hypertension.
Specific therapies to reduce isoLG formation have proven effective in experimental models and have
substantial promise for treatment of human hypertension."

Tendons and ligaments are fundamental components of a functional musculoskeletal system. Tendons
attach muscles to bone and interact with these tissues at distinct attachment sites called entheses
(bone) and myotendinous junctions (MTJs, muscle). These interactions cause unique changes in gene
expression and extracellular matrix (ECM) production that allow tendons to bear the forces exerted by
muscle contraction. Transcription factors such as Scleraxis (Scx) specify early tendon progenitor cells
(TPCs) and regulate ECM production. We previously discovered a critical ECM scaffolding protein
called Thrombospondin-4b (Tsp4b) in zebrafish that is regulated by Scx, required for tendon
maintenance and conserved in human tendons. How different types of tendon fibroblasts (tenocytes)
are specified and influence ECM assembly at entheses or MTJs remains unclear. The current proposal
addresses these issues using the advantages of the zebrafish for single cell RNA sequencing, in vivo
imaging and genetic manipulation. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the
spatial dynamics of gene regulation and ECM assembly in tendons/ligaments and their regulation by
mechanical force. Three primary hypotheses guide the research: 1) distinct subtypes of TPCs develop
at entheses and MTJs in response to force, 2) ECM secreted by tenocytes regulates force-dependent
signals that alter these distinct modes of gene expression in tenocytes and 3) retinoic acid is a novel
force-dependent signal controlling tendon development. Aim 1 will perform scRNA-seq in tenocytes and
see how force alters gene expression profiles. Aim 2 will study roles for Tsp4b, ECM, and TGF-beta
signaling in force-dependent gene expression in tendons. Aim 3 will study the roles of RA signaling in
tendons, and its responses to mechanical load. Each aim combines novel single cell approaches,
genetic manipulation, live imaging and quantitative methods for physiological stimulation of muscles to
get at mechanisms of tendon cell specification and ECM assembly in response to force."
10763007,"Project Summary
DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) interfere with cellular viability, but also initiate chromosomal
translocations resulting in genomic instability and promoting carcinogenesis. BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are
essential for homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of DSBs. Understanding the mechanisms of the
BRCA pathway has broad implications for human health. When replication forks encounter damaged DNA,
they arrest and unless properly processed, they collapse leading to DNA breaks and genomic instability. To
avoid their collapse, stalled forks can be reversed by annealing the two nascent strands to each other, in a
process catalyzed by DNA translocases such as ZRANB3. The BRCA proteins load RAD51 on reversed forks
to protect the DNA ends against degradation by the nuclease MRE11. The ability to protect forks against
degradation corelates with DNA damage sensitivity. Thus, replication fork protection is essential for DNA repair
and genomic stability. However, how protection of stalled replication forks against nucleolytic degradation is
achieved represents a major knowledge gap. The PARP family at least 17 members, with various and lesser
understood functions than the founding member PARP1. PARP14 has been associated with multiple cellular
processes, but mechanistic details are generally sparse. We previously showed that PARP14 loss reduces HR
efficiency and sensitizes cells to radiation. Recently, we have identified a novel role of PARP14 in promoting
replication fork degradation, genomic instability and DNA damage sensitivity, which is the focus on this
application. For this application, our goal is to understand how PARP14 promotes fork degradation, resulting in
DNA damage sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells. Our overall hypothesis is that PARP14 interferes with the
RAD51-MRE11 mechanism of control of DNA resection at reversed replication forks to trigger nascent strand
degradation, thus enhancing DNA damage sensitivity in BRCA-deficient cells. Aim 1 is to reveal the impact of
PARP14 on RAD51-mediated protection of stalled replication forks. We hypothesize that PARP14 interferes
with BRCA-independent stabilization of RAD51 on reversed forks, to enhance their degradation. Aim 2 is to
uncover how PARP14 engages MRE11 for nucleolytic degradation of damaged forks. We hypothesize that
PARP14 binds to stalled replication forks in BRCA-deficient cells and recruits MRE11 to initiate nucleolytic
degradation of nascent DNA at these structures. Aim 3 is to elucidate the role of KU in fork protection against
nucleolytic resection by EXO1 and MRE11. We hypothesize that KU binding to reversed forks protects them
against EXO1-mediated degradation, but enables nascent strand resection by the MRE11-PARP14 complex.
Since DNA damaging agents promote genomic instability by inducing nascent strand degradation, potentially
underlying their carcinogenesis, successful accomplishment of these Specific Aims would reveal a new
mechanism of genome stability and tumor suppression, centered on PARP14. It may also reveal PARP14 as a
biomarker for the tumor response to radiation and genotoxic chemotherapy, in the context of the BRCA status."

 There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan,
2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely
to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E,
2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009; Seo, Shen & Alfaro, 2019). Students
from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major
in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha,
2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have
the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later
mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, we propose to build a
mathematical problem-solving environment, Teachley Problem Solving (TPS), to transform the
way elementary students learn to solve math problems. TPS will include a set of digital tools to
help students understand and classify the underlying structure of problems, use clear visuals to
model the mathematics of the problems, and construct strong mathematical arguments. The
environment will also integrate into ASSISTments, a math curriculum platform built by The
ASSISTments Foundation and Wooster Polytechnic Institute .
 Outcomes. The proposal will encourage two main outcomes, namely: 1) improved
student math achievement and 2) increased math self-efficacy. A key research aim is to
determine whether supporting elementary students with digital problem-solving tools helps them
develop stronger problem-solving skills as compared to typical instruction. We also anticipate
that using the engaging tools with real-time feedback will also bolster students’ motivation and
self-efficacy in mathematics.
 Improving students’ academic outcomes and math self-efficacy during elementary school
will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math
classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a
distal outcome of this proposal is increasing the number of students pursuing careers in STEM."
10762965,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes localized and disseminated
disease, cryptococcosis, in immunocompromised individuals, such as in people living with HIV. A life-
threatening manifestation of cryptococcosis is cryptococcal meningitis (CM); a central nervous system infection
with acute inflammation of the meninges and the most common cause of meningitis in those with HIV. Sub-
Saharan Africa carries the majority of the global CM disease burden and mortality. Because the host immune
response is crucial to clearance of the infection and resolution of symptoms, a solid understanding of the host
immune response in the state of cryptococcal infection is essential in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.
 Natural killer (NK) cells are an innate lymphoid immune cell that has been understudied in CM. NK cells
have antigen independent cytotoxic ability that render them ideal for targeting both intracellular and
extracellular pathogens. This key feature of NK cells could make them an important aspect in the immune
response to C. neoformans, which is both an intracellular and extracellular pathogen. Standard antifungal
therapy targets the pathogen, yet mortality still occurs, including among persons with sterile CSF cultures. My
preliminary data has shown that low CSF concentrations of NK cell cytotoxicity associated soluble molecules
are associated with increased risk of acute 14-day mortality in persons with CM. Therefore, improving NK
cytotoxic activity may be an innovative therapeutic pathway toward reducing cryptococcal mortality.
Additionally, the identification of genes and pathways implicated in impaired NK cell function that could be
modulated to improve cytotoxicity could be targets for future therapeutics.
 My central hypothesis is that NK cells contribute to fungal clearance of C. neoformans, but that a
combination of NK cell exhaustion, impaired cytokine production, increased inhibitory receptors, and
decreased activating receptor expression due to the underlying HIV infection disrupts their cytotoxic abilities.
To test the central hypothesis, I am proposing the following Aims: Aim 1 seeks to compare NK cell natural
cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity between HIV-infected persons with CM who die
within 14-days of diagnosis and those who survive >14 day. Aim 2 seeks to determine if persons with CM who
die within 14-days have high levels of differentially expressed genes involved in exhaustion and inhibition of
cytotoxicity pathways when compared to persons who survive CM. Collectively, these findings will provide the
first quantification of NK cell cytotoxicity against clinical isolates of C. neoformans and the identification of
differentially expressed genes associated with acute CM mortality. This information will provide us with specific
genes that are involved in exhaustion, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity that could be modulated in the
future with host targeted immunotherapy."

Peanut allergy (PA) has emerged as a major clinical and public health problem worldwide, due to the dramatic
increase in prevalence, its life-long persistence in most cases, and its associated life-threatening anaphylactic
response. The causes and precise molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PA remain largely
unknown. Available data underscore the early life period (i.e., in-utero and first few years of life) as the critical
window in the development of PA, which is also the critical developmental window for the adaptive immune
system. There is increasing evidence that T cells play a critical role in modulating tolerance to peanut and risk
of PA. Specifically, CD4+ T cells recognize peanut antigens through the engagement of T cell receptors
(TCRs). Each individual has a large and highly variable TCR repertoire which is a major determinant in the
immune response to a given antigen. To date, few studies have longitudinally characterized TCR repertoire
development and dynamics in relation to PA, especially in the context of early life risk or protective factors of
PA such as nutrition and metabolomic alteration and their joint associations with PA development during
childhood. This proposal, motivated by our intriguing previous work and promising preliminary data, will
harness the cutting-edge Adaptive immunoSEQ® technology to deep sequence the TCR ß-chain (TCRß)
complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) at birth (reflecting in-utero development) and at age 1-2 years
(reflecting postnatal development) in 300 children (150 peanut allergic and 150 non-allergic, non-sensitized
children) from the prospective Boston Birth Cohort (BBC), a NIH-funded U.S. urban, low-resourced
underrepresented multi-ethnic cohort. By leveraging the BBC’s existing biospecimen, genome-wide genotype
data, metabolome, and extensive epidemiological and clinical databases, we aim to investigate: (1)
Longitudinal associations of early life TCRß repertoire development with child risk of PA. We
hypothesize that TCRß repertoire features (i.e., composition, diversity, and dynamics) at birth, at age 1-2
years, and their longitudinal changes are associated with childhood risk of PA. We will further identify peanut-
specific CD4+ T cell subsets with enriched peanut-specific CDR3 (ps-CDR3) sequences or motifs; (2) The
interplay of early life factors, metabolome, and TCRß repertoire on child risk of PA. We hypothesize that
early life nutritional and metabolic factors may influence TCRß repertoire development, and, in turn, may
jointly affect child risk of PA. This proposal is strengthened by its prospective birth cohort design; a strong
multi-disciplinary collaborative team, novel integration of TCRß repertoires with early life exposure to nutrition
and metabolome; and focus on underrepresented, under-studied, high risk, predominantly minority children.
Successful completion of this project will identify novel biomarkers for early risk assessment of PA and new
targets for intervention during the earliest developmental windows. In short, this study represents a unique
opportunity to advance the field and open doors to promising new directions to unlock the mystery of PA."

Stem-cell based strategy has been widely considered as a promising approach to replace damaged pulp and
dentin structures and restore their biological functions in regenerative endodontics. However, regeneration of
functional tubular dentin has been a challenge owing to the lack of understanding dental pulp stem cell (DPSC)
polarization and differentiation as well as the underlying mechanism that are prerequisite for tubular dentin
regeneration. A unique biomimetic 3D platform was recently developed to study DPSC polarization and
differentiation in the PI’s group. This platform can precisely manipulate single cells on each microisland of the
3D platform and is an excellent tool to decipher the biophysical and biochemical signals that initiate and regulate
DPSC polarization at the single cell level. A variety of biophysical factors were screened using this 3D platform,
and the nanofibrous architecture and tubular structure of the matrix were identified to be the two critical
biophysical factors that initiate and regulate DPSC polarization. The combination of RNA-seq with laser
microdissection techniques and a conditional knockout model further identified that TGF-1 is a crucial
biochemical factor for odontogenesis. Consequently, the hypothesis of this work is that DPSC polarization is
controlled by a dynamic signaling network composed of a set of critical biophysical and biochemical factors, and
integration of these factors in scaffolding design will regenerate tubular dentin from DPSCs. Therefore, the
overall objective of this proposal is to explore and optimize the parameters that initiate/modulate DPSC
polarization, understand the underlying mechanism of DPSC polarization, and regenerate tubular dentin in vivo.
To accomplish the overall objective for this project, three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will explore how the
biomimetic tubular matrix modulates DPSC polarization and differentiation. Aim 2 will examine how TGF-1
regulates DPSC polarization and differentiation. Aim 3 will integrate TGF-1 into the biomimetic tubular matrix
to regenerate tubular dentin in vivo. Successfully completing this work will fundamentally advance the
understanding of DPSC polarization and differentiation, and greatly promote the ability to develop new bio-
inspired matrices to regenerate functional tubular dentin for regenerative dental therapies."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in adolescents in the United States,
affecting approximately 1 in 400 adolescents by 18 years of age. Adolescents with T1D are at risk for acute
and long-term complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular, renal,
and neuropathic disease. Maintaining adequate glycemic control reduces the risk of these complications.
Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in adolescents with T1D, occurring at approximately 2 to 3 times the rate of
the general adolescent population. Anxiety symptoms are associated with out-of-range glycemic control, poor
quality of life (QOL), and poor self-management. Targeted interventions to reduce anxiety symptoms will
contribute to improved QOL and improved self-management of T1D and thus improved disease outcomes.
Despite the high prevalence of anxiety symptoms and strong associations with diabetes-related complications,
few evidence-based interventions have been adapted for this high-risk population. This proposal uses a
systematic and iterative approach to adapt an evidence-based intervention for anxiety symptoms, mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR), specifically to meet the developmental and lifestyle needs of this population.
My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the knowledge, skills, and
research experience necessary to become an independent clinical investigator focused on developing,
implementing, and testing behavioral interventions and improving disease outcomes in adolescents with Type
1 diabetes (T1D). This proposal constructs and tests the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted MBSR
mHealth application for adolescents with T1D. The specific aims of this mixed methods proposal are to: 1.
Analyze qualitative interviews with 20 adolescents with T1D and conduct interviews with 10 key stakeholders
(pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric endocrinology (PE) nurse practitioner, PE nurse, PE psychologist, and PE
social worker) to ascertain challenges, needs, and perceptions related to anxiety management, mindfulness-
based interventions, and mHealth application features.; 2. Generate an mHealth application prototype that
integrates data obtained from Aim 1 to adapt MBSR specifically for adolescents with T1D; 3a. Evaluate the
MBSR mHealth application prototype for engagement, feasibility, and acceptability among 40 adolescents with
T1D; and 3b. Explore preliminary efficacy of the adapted MBSR mHealth application prototype on anxiety
symptoms, QOL, self-management, and glycemic control in 40 adolescents with T1D.
Proposed career and learning objectives are to: 1. Develop comprehensive knowledge of mHealth intervention
development and implementation.; 2. Acquire intensive training in the delivery of MBSR.; and 3. Disseminate
findings through national and international presentations, and peer-reviewed publications.
Long-term career goal: Build a robust program of externally-funded research to develop and disseminate
interventions that are sustainable and actively utilized in clinical practice."

Structural Racism and Discrimination in the Expansion of Hospital Stroke Care Capacity
 Although advances in the treatment of stroke have significantly decreased morbidity and mortality for
stroke patients in the United States, there is a growing disparity in the provision of stroke services between
disadvantaged populations and others. No studies have examined the role of structural racism and
discrimination (SRD) in the expansion of stroke care capacity across communities and subsequent effects on
health disparity patients. The long-term goal of this project is to identify system-level pathways in the delivery
of acute stroke care that contribute to the growing disparities for NIH-designated health disparity populations
(defined as racial/ethnic minority, low-income, and rural patients). The overall objective is to determine the
mechanisms through which health disparity patients experience SRD in stroke care.
 Using national data from 2009 to 2019, we propose three aims to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1,
That disadvantaged communities (defined as segregated areas with high shares of health disparity
populations) experience differential adoption of levels of stroke care, resulting in increased disparities in
potential access to care relative to other communities. Aim 2, That health disparity patients in segregated
communities experience increased disparities in actual access and treatment due to patient redistribution
across hospitals with different levels of stroke care and differential treatment within hospitals. Aim 3, That
individuals in disadvantaged communities and health disparity patients experience widening disparities in
health and functional outcomes.
 In Aim 1, we will identify which types of disadvantaged communities, if any, were left behind in gaining
stroke care access, and whether racial or ethnic segregation and income inequality contribute to these
structural disparities in geographic access. These results will aid certification bodies to consider incorporating
community need in certification guidelines. In Aim 2, our results will illuminate patient redistribution patterns in
communities that gain access to stroke care and pinpoint patients who experience disparities in actual access
and treatment depending on their race, ethnicity, and income as well as the level of segregation in each of
those dimensions. Results will identify the types of communities where outreach might be most effective in
reducing disparities in stroke care. In Aim 3, our results will determine the extent of health disparities among
stroke patients a) between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities after adoption of stroke care,
compared to communities with no change; and b) between health disparity and other patients within the same
community when those communities experience changes in stroke care, relative to those in communities with
no change in access to stroke care. These findings will identify specific communities where additional
interventions (e.g., mobile stroke units, enhancing telehealth access) could yield the greatest benefits."
10911296,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Pruritus, the urge to scratch due to an unpleasant sensation (acute and chronic), is the most frequent symptom
in skin diseases like Atopic Dermatitis (AD). Although the origin of itch is not fully elucidated, treating chronic
itch is an important part of caring for AD patients’ well-being. Pruritus affects sleep, mood, personal relationships
and can significantly reduce quality of life. In fact, the negative impact of chronic itch on patient’s well-being is
reported to be like that of chronic pain. AD is typically caused by multiple pruritogenic mediators. Antihistamines
may have utility in treating acute pruritus, but have not been effective in chronic pruritus or AD. The management
of chronic pruritus in AD represents an unmet medical need, currently without effective treatment options, and
underscores the need for new therapies against novel targets within non-histaminergic pathways.
An important component of the pathophysiologic mechanism of non-histaminergic chronic pruritus involves the
increase of 5-HT levels in the innervated dermis/epidermis. Elevated levels of 5-HT in patients with AD (serum)
and chronic eczema (skin) have been reported. Recent studies demonstrate the serotonergic 5-HT7 receptor
plays an important role in TRPA1 Ca2+ flux mediated pruritus. 5-HT7 and TRPA1 receptors are co-expressed on
a subset of primary afferent sensory neurons in the skin. Both receptors are functionally coupled where 5-HT7
stimulation results in opening of TRPA1 channels promoting neuronal depolarization and action potential firing,
and ultimately triggering itch-evoked scratching. In vivo studies strongly support that 5-HT signaling contributes
to the pathogenesis of pruritus through 5-HT7-TRPA1 signaling. Praeventix has confirmed the role of 5-
HT7/TRPA1 blockade in the MC903 induced AD model. These data strongly demonstrate selective inhibition of
the 5HT7/TRPA1 signaling pathway will translate to a meaningful suppression of the itch/scratch cycle.
Praeventix has identified clinical lead PRA-523, a potent selective 5-HT7 antagonist that inhibits Ca2+ flux in 5-
HT7/TRPA1-HEK293 cells. PRA-523 exhibits peripherally restricted pharmacokinetics and good dermal
penetration/permeability that is ideal for a topically administered product. Studies in the MC903 induced AD
model demonstrated topically applied PRA-523 significantly and dose dependently reduced scratching behavior
in both male and female mice. These data strongly demonstrate that selective inhibition of the 5-HT7/TRPA1
signaling pathway will translate to meaningful suppression of pruritus.
This proposal aims to complete the initial IND enabling studies to permit the advancement of PRA-523 into GLP
toxicology studies, develop the clinical formulation and manufacture the drug product needed for the planned
nonclinical studies. This work will be performed at high quality contract research organizations in the USA,
overseen by the experienced team at Praeventix."

In view of the continued disproportionate rates of HIV infection among Black men who have sex with men
(MSM), there is an urgent public health need to identify scalable interventions to support Black MSM at risk of
HIV to decide to take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), help access PrEP, and adhere to PrEP. Currently,
Black MSM have the highest rates of HIV acquisition in the United States yet have the lowest rates of PrEP
utilization. Innovative methods to support use of this lifesaving medication are few and those that are available
are seldom rigorously tested. One intervention demonstrated in early studies to have potential for positive
impact a client-centered care coordination (C4) intervention model. C4 was piloted in the NIH-funded HIV
Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 073 study and showed promise, yet more evaluation is required to assess
and leverage this intervention. The aims of this study are to further the work done in HPTN 073 with regard to
C4 in real-world clinical settings in Washington, DC and in New York City. Aim 1 will determine the efficacy of
C4 for increasing PrEP adherence among Black MSM, Aim 2 will identify the optimal dose of C4
implementation for maximizing its effect on PrEP adherence, and Aim 3 will d Describe the acceptability and
feasibility of C4 implementation in community settings. Findings from this study will contribute to the NIH
priorities to reduce HIV incidence as well as cross-cutting areas of using implementation science to contribute
to our understanding of structural and psychosocial barriers to care and reduction of healthcare disparities."
10910145,"Summary/Abstract
HIV infection has been associated with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities, including atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and heart failure. Our long-standing work focusing on subclinical cardiovascular
measures (e.g., carotid artery atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction) in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study
(WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) (now as a Combined Cohort Study, MWCCS) have
provided insights into the effects of HIV infection, along with chronic inflammation, immune activation, and
antiretroviral therapy (ART) on multiple cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the underlying pathogenesis of
these interrelated cardiovascular comorbidities, and especially their shared biological mechanisms, is not fully
understood. Our existing work among WIHS women has identified several gut bacteria and related host
immunological markers and microbial metabolites associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis. In this study,
we propose to extend our multi-omics work to the MWCCS and expand our cardiovascular outcomes to
multiple vascular and cardiac phenotypes measured through carotid artery ultrasound (carotid artery plaque,
arterial stiffness) and echocardiography (left ventricular [LV)] systolic dysfunction, LV diastolic dysfunction and
LV longitudinal strain). Using a novel multi-faceted analysis among up to 2000 participants (~65% of whom are
HIV+), we propose to apply our multi-omics approaches (metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,
metabolomics) to identify common gut microbial alterations associated with multiple vascular and cardiac
measures and examine their underlying mechanisms in the context of HIV infection. In addition, we will
examine how HIV infection and HIV-specific factors (e.g., long-term specific ART, persistent viremia, CD4
counts) may influence cardiovascular phenotypes through alterations in gut microbiota and related
immunologic and metabolomic features. Findings from this study will improve understanding of common,
overlapping etiologies underlying the multiple cardiovascular comorbidities associated with HIV infection.
These findings will also identify potential therapeutic targets (e.g., microbiota modification) applicable to
various cardiovascular disorders for which current treatments are only partially effective or lacking in this and
other high-risk populations."
10782357,"Clinician-scientists provide distinct and valuable perspectives on patient-oriented research (POR). Unfortunately, the number of new clinician-scientists has steadily declined over the past few decades. Mentorship is a critical means of developing an effective pipeline of clinical research faculty.

Dr. Kratz is a midcareer clinician-scientist in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the University of Michigan. She is a licensed clinical psychologist with clinical and research expertise in mind-body, complementary, and integrative treatments of hard-to-manage symptoms, such as chronic pain and fatigue. The goal with this K24 application is to achieve 25% protected time for the applicant to continue mentoring trainees in POR and to grow her current research program in new directions to expand opportunities to mentor in POR focused on complementary and integrative medicine. The candidate has demonstrated significant commitment to and abilities in mentoring trainees at all career stages and will continue to benefit from the robust academic environment at the University of Michigan that provides stellar research infrastructure and a large pool of mentees. During the funding period, further development of the applicant will include: 1) Improvement in
mentorship and leadership skills in POR; 2) Building skills and collaborations in acupressure for management of pain and other symptoms; and 3) Development of skills and collaboration in use of just-in-time adaptive interventions to deliver mind/body/behavioral symptom self-management programs. These skillsets will be achieved through a combination of workshops, meetings, courses, and collaboration with technical experts and mentors. In addition, these skillsets will grow through continued mentorship of trainees within currently funded POR and through expansion into new complementary and integrative approaches for pain management through the K24 mechanism. Research opportunities include: work that examines the effects of  cannabinoids on sleep and pain in multiple sclerosis (Project 1); A multi-stage project to develop and then pilot test an acceptance-based eHealth program for chronic pain management in spinal cord injury (Project 2); A study to develop and assess the usability of relaxing and stimulating self-acupressure therapies for symptom management in multiple sclerosis (Project 3) and; A new study that builds on the candidate’s previous ambulatory research characterizing momentary dynamic associations between pain and functioning by expanding to develop just-in-time adaptive interventions to promote symptom self-management (Project 4). Completion of this award will result in successful mentoring of current and future mentees in POR and enlarge the POR program of the applicant to ensure continued mentoring opportunities into the future."
10909358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At the heart of Alzheimer’s (AD) pathogenesis, tau pathology is linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive
decline. We have spent the last decade addressing how tau exerts its toxicity in AD. Among the many tau post-
translational modifications (PTMs) that are now known to co-occur and target tau, acetylation of tau’s lysines,
which have emerged from recent cryo-EM and mass spectrometry studies, is a particularly relevant and
attractive target. Coupled with the fact that acetylation accelerates tau aggregation, prevents normal
microtubule binding, and induces prominent AD-like deficits including synaptic dysfunction and cognitive
decline, these properties would appear to set this particular PTM apart from many of the other tau PTMs that
are known to regulate tau. While acetylated tau is common to virtually all sporadic AD brains, there remain few
reliable models to unravel the signaling events and enzymes that converge on this idea. In our view, this gap
needs to be overcome if we hope to unravel mechanisms that drive tau pathogenesis. We identified a new
signaling pathway in which the Parkinson’s disease (PD)-relevant kinase LRRK2 acts upstream to regulate
HDACs and therefore indirectly controls tau acetylation. We hypothesize that LRRK2 and other related “HDAC
kinases” act as master regulators of HDAC function, with their end goal of preventing the accumulation of
acetylated tau and thereby protecting against tau toxicity. In Aim-1, we develop a new model based on an
engineered cytoplasmic CBP acetyltransferase to precisely target cytoplasmic tau and then assess the extent
of tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction, tau seeding, and tau propagation. Having narrowed in on HDACs 3/6 as
the only tau-associated HDACs among all human HDACs, we will deliver them to neurons and determine
whether synergism among HDACs converges onto tau to suppress its toxicity. In Aim-2, we focus on the
upstream kinases that coordinate HDAC activity. We explore LRRK2 as a very attractive hit identified in a mini
screen that modulates HDAC3/6 function. We will manipulate LRRK2 function in mouse neurons, mice, and
human iPSC neurons to evaluate downstream consequences on HDACs and tau. Our proposal will shed light,
not only on AD-relevant HDACs, but also open up new therapeutic avenues (e.g., the targeting of upstream
kinases) to suppress toxic tau species in the brain. This proposal is therefore both innovative and significant
since upstream HDAC regulatory kinases including LRRK2 and PKC hold promise as unanticipated regulators
of HDAC activity. This will expand our repertoire of targetable pathways in tauopathies that include AD and
even PD as well."

Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a ubiquitous skin infection that can cause Merkel cell carcinoma
(MCC), a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Immune suppression is one of the most important risk
factors for developing MCPyV-associated MCC. MCPyV has a far greater chance to induce cancer
development among immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-infected patients. However, both
the MCPyV life cycle and oncogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. The incidence of MCC
has tripled over the past twenty years, but effective treatments are lacking. Therefore, a better
understanding of the MCPyV life cycle and oncogenic mechanisms is needed for developing more
effective treatments. In MCPyV-infected cells, the early promoter (EP) supports the transcription of
early genes and plays a critical role in maintaining persistent infection. In the majority of MCCs,
MCPyV DNA is clonally integrated into the cancer genome, where the EP drives the expression of
viral oncogenes, large and small T antigens, to promote MCC tumor growth. MCPyV EP transcription
therefore is also critical for supporting MCC oncogenesis. However, very little is known about the
mechanisms that regulate MCPyV EP during either MCPyV infection or MCC development. This gap
in our knowledge is largely because, until recently, the cellular tropism of MCPyV was unknown and
there was a lack of a biologically relevant culture system for studying MCPyV. We recently identified
human dermal fibroblast (HDF) as a natural host cell for MCPyV infection. We found that MCPyV
entry is a promiscuous process, whereas its transcription is the key determinant for MCPyV host cell
tropism, persistent infection, and oncogenic potential. Building on the in vitro and ex vivo infection
models developed in our recent studies, we propose to discover the epigenetic mechanisms (Aim 1)
as well as host cellular factors and cis-acting viral DNA elements (Aim 2) that regulate MCPyV early
gene transcription. We will also apply the recently developed lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology to
abolish MCPyV oncogene transcription and obliterate MCC tumorigenesis (Aim 3). Our studies will fill
a significant knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms that regulate MCPyV early
transcription during the viral life cycle and MCC tumorigenic development. Moreover, our investigation
will provide important insights into the virology and oncogenic mechanism of this new human tumor
virus, and identify novel targets for developing better strategies to treat the highly lethal MCC skin
cancers with a rapidly rising incidence. As demonstrated by the success of COVID-19 vaccines, the
highly potent LNPs have shown great promise for therapeutic applications. Therefore, the superb in
vivo delivery power of LNPs affords a viable platform for translating our findings into clinical setting."
10914983,"The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is high and projected to increase. Further, epidemiological data
suggests that ~15% of AD risk may be attributed to sleep problems. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also
common among the elderly (30-55%), and our prior work has established that cognitively normal older women
with OSA have nearly double the 5-year risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.
Further, we showed that: i. OSA patients treated with positive airway pressure (PAP) experienced significant
overnight increases in plasma neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of neural injury, with strong trends for AD-
specific biomarkers (i.e. Aβ40 and Tau) after PAP withdrawal; ii. OSA predicted longitudinal increases in AD
biomarkers; and, iii. PAP treatment delayed the onset of MCI in subjects with reported OSA. There is therefore
strong evidence suggesting that OSA treatment could be an important prevention strategy for AD. However,
trials for treatment of OSA to slow cognitive decline and progression to AD face a number of challenges. First,
the most effective therapy (PAP) has poor adherence. A second challenge is defining the target population:
prior trials targeted OSA patients with MCI/AD, who have more advanced disease and could be less amenable
to treatment. A third challenge is identifying cognitive testing that is sensitive to sleep disruption, and linked to
increased AD risk. (To capture effects of OSA on the offline processing phase requires sleep-dependent
memory paradigms, in which the encoding and recall of information are separated by a period of sleep
with/without OSA). Finally, a randomized trial of sufficient duration to test the effects of treatment of OSA on
risk of incident AD is not feasible. Our proposed trial, Effects of Successful OSA TreatmENT on Memory and
AD BIomarkers in Older AduLts (ESSENTIAL), addresses these challenges. ESSENTIAL is a 5-year study of
cognitively normal older adults with newly diagnosed OSA, ages 55-75, recruited from 4 well-established sleep
clinics. OSA patients (n=200) will be randomized to either: i) a 3-month OSA treatment by any combination of
PAP, OAT, and positional therapy that results in an “effective” improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index
(AHI); ii) a waitlist control group to receive treatment at the conclusion of the 3-month intervention period.
Effectively treated individuals (~150) and untreated individuals (~100) will then be followed for up to 24 months
to compare whether sustained improvements in AHI are associated with better cognitive function and AD
biomarker change profiles as compared to untreated controls. Participants will undergo PSG, actigraphy,
cognitive tests, and blood draws at baseline, 3 and 24 months. Our aims are: 1) To compare 3-month change
in plasma AD biomarkers (NfL, p-tau, Aβ) between those randomized to OSA treatment and wait-list control
groups; 2) To compare 3-month change in cognition between the OSA treatment and wait-list control groups;
3) To examine if sustained reduction in AHI over 24 months among effectively treated participants versus
untreated controls is associated with better 24-month change profiles for AD biomarkers and cognition."
10903976,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disorder that results in
progressive renal insufficiency and often kidney failure and accounts for ~5% of US kidney transplant
and dialysis patients. ADPKD is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous with seven genes now
associated with this disease, including the major loci, PKD1 and PKD2. Large patient populations
collected at Mayo Clinic have been central to new gene identification, and newly available populations of
normal individuals with whole exome sequencing and clinical data are providing insight into the
penetrance of ADPKD genes and alleles. In Aim 1, using these populations we will determine the extent
to which phenotypes within the ADPKD spectrum are dictated by novel genes, and explore the
penetrance of known alleles. Allelic diversity and complexity, especially for PKD1, has made diagnostics
for this disorder complex, with many patients not obtaining a definite genetic diagnosis following testing
using the existing variant evaluation guidelines; only variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are defined.
Functional, cellular assays and whole animal systems can help to determine pathogenicity and
penetrance of variants classified as VUS. In Aim 2 we will employ cellular and in vivo studies to determine
the mechanism(s) of disease causation for PKD1 and PKD2 pathogenic variants. These studies will
improve diagnostics and generate models that together will unravel the pathogenic mechanism of many
nontruncating variants and allow the associated disease to be modeled. Insights into the
pathomechanism of disease can also highlight new treatment options that are proximal to the primary
genetic defect, strategies that have been successful exploited for other monogenic disorders. Two variant
types in particular, missense changes that result in folding and trafficking problems, and nonsense
variants are common causes of disease in PKD1 and PKD2. In Aim 3 we will, explore allele-based
treatment options for ADPKD. Specifically, chaperone treatments will be tested for missense variants
where a folding/trafficking defect is the mutational mechanism, and the value of readthrough drugs for a
variety of PKD1 and PKD2 nonsense variants will be tested, both with cellular assays and in vivo systems.
Treatment options for ADPKD also depend on better understanding the mutational mechanism at the
level of the cyst; there has long been controversy in ADPKD about the importance and timing of somatic
second hits for cyst initiation and/or expansion. In Aim 4 we will investigate the role of somatic changes
in cyst initiation and development using single cell DNA sequencing methods. Overall, our proposal will
result in better understand the pathomechanisms associated with the genetic complexity of ADPKD, with
the premise that improved understanding will result in new targeted therapeutic options."

The cause of Huntington’s disease is an increase in the trinucleotide CAG repeat from under
36 repeats to 36 or greater repeats. The mode for the number of repeats is 42, and most
patients have between 40 and 45. The disease generally starts between ages 30 and 40,
with onset and progression of impaired cognition, depression, and aberrant movement. The
genetics is autosomal dominant. Lowering mutant huntingtin in HD animal models delays
onset of disease or mitigates the severity of disease. We use advanced, modified, di-
branched siRNA to lower mutant huntingtin, by invoking RNA interference in brain. Our
advanced siRNA achieves therapeutic advantages: spread throughout the brain in non-
human primate and long-term huntingtin lowering after a single administration into the
cerebrospinal fluid. The siRNA will be optimized in structure for safety and preliminary
results will be secured. The goal of this CREATE proposal is to set the stage for promising
therapeutics for treatment of Huntington’s disease. Similar treatments could be applicable to
other autosomal dominant neurological disorders."

Cortical subregions are often implicated in a variety of behavioral functions, but it is not well understood how
these areas encode such diverse information. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is necessary for emotional
processing and social cognition, but how it encodes stimuli relevant to both processes is unknown. The goal of
this proposal is to understand the functional heterogeneity of ACC circuits, and how this impacts encoding of
diverse stimuli and cognitive function. In Aim 1, we will determine the functional heterogeneity of ACC inhibitory
circuits during social and anxiety-like behaviors. To monitor interneuron activity, we will first inject an adeno-
associated virus (AAV) that expresses GCaMP6f, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, in a Cre-dependent manner into
the ACC of somatostatin (SST)- or parvalbumin (PV)-cre transgenic mice. Next, we will use the 3D-printed
miniature miniscopes to perform in vivo single-cell resolution calcium imaging in either somatostatin or
parvalbumin interneurons in the ACC to investigate their functional heterogeneity while mice performed tasks to
assay anxiety-like behaviors, general sociability and social novelty. In Aim 2, we will determine whether specific
populations of excitatory pyramidal cells (Pyr) in the ACC encode particular behavioral stimuli. First, to target
specific populations of Pyr in the ACC, we will inject an AAV that expresses Cre recombinase and can
retrogradely label cells into either the contralateral ACC, anterior thalamic nucleus, or the retrosplenial cortex.
Next, we will inject an AAV that expresses GCaMP6 in a cre-dependent manner to label Pyr in the ACC and
project to either the contralateral ACC, anterior thalamic nucleus or retrosplenial cortex. Three weeks later, we
will use approaches described in Aim 1 to monitor the activity of specific populations of Pyr during particular
behaviors. We will also determine the laminar sources of synaptic input to VIP interneurons in the ACC. To test
this, we will first cross VIP-cre mice to a cre-dependent fluorescent reporter line. Next, we will inject an AAV
expressing ChETA, a light-activated channel, into the contralateral ACC, anterior thalamic nucleus or
retrosplenial cortex. Four weeks after viral injections, we will combine electrophysiological recordings in acute
brain slices with optogenetic stimulation to characterize the laminar organization of specific projections unto VIP
interneurons in the ACC. In addition to determining the connectivity probability of these inputs, we will correlate
the cortical depth of the soma to morphological, and electrophysiological properties and molecular markers.
While reductionist and simplified models of cortical networks have established a framework to understand their
function, it is now evident that to understand the role of cortical networks in complex, adaptive behavior,
optimized models will need to incorporate the functional heterogeneity of these circuits. Completion of these
aims will dissect the functional heterogeneity of inhibitory circuits in the ACC."

phase III trials have failed without a single success so discovery of a universal therapy seems increasingly
unlikely. NINDS and other federal agencies have committed tens of millions of dollars to large,
observational, human studies of TBI. These studies are genotyping and deeply phenotyping TBI patients
with the goal of personalizing therapy. These efforts have already revealed fascinating correlations between
genotype and TBI outcome. However, genes cannot be switched on an off in humans for ethical reasons.
Therefore, new tools are necessary to move from detecting correlations to testing hypotheses. This
challenge has been addressed in other diseases using human, in vitro models. Human neurons generated
from patients using stem cell technology retain the genetic identity of the patient. Also, genetic variants can
be changed one at a time in these cells. Therefore, hypotheses about the role of genotype in disease can
be tested in human, in vitro models but only if the disease pathology can reproduced in vitro. Reproducing
neurotrauma pathology in vitro requires special tools because it depends intrinsically on a mechanical insult.
The goal of this proposal is to provide new tools for modeling neurotrauma in vitro that can take advantage
of exciting recent developments in human, in vitro cultures. Target-driven drug discovery is difficult in
neurotrauma because the molecular mechanisms are complex. Phenotypic drug discovery is therefore
preferable but it can succeed only if it addresses a clinically relevant phenotype. In vitro, electrical field
recordings are attractive because they are analogous to electroencephalography, which is commonly used
to assess TBI patients. This work will contribute the first, multi-electrode array (MEA) that can acquire field
recordings from a high throughput, in vitro model. Brain organoids reproduce aspects of disease that cannot
be reproduced in 2D cultures. However, electrical field recordings are difficult to acquire from brain
organoids because conventional, multi-electrode arrays are designed for adherent cultures while brain
organoids require ultra-low adherence conditions. Therefore, novel, sub-millimeter scale structures are
proposed that will enclose an organoid inside an array of electrodes without adhering to it so that long term
measures of electrical activity and connectivity can be made. These 3D MEAs will contribute new insights to
many neurological disorders beside neurotrauma. Currently, there are no tools available that can apply a
biofidelic, mechanical insult to an organoid culture. The proposed work will develop such a tool. In
combination, these new tools will open new horizons in the field around personalizing therapy, probing
disease mechanism and offering patient-specific risk assessment."

The goal of this proposal is to determine how microglia and astrocytes communicate to remodel
synapses. Trillions of synapses form highly precise circuit maps in the brain. These maps are shaped and
maintained by sensory experience (vision, touch, etc.), including elimination of less active synapses and f
maintenance and strengthening of other synapses. Despite over 50 years of research, the underlying
mechanisms by which activity dictates removal of some synapses, but not others, remains an open question.
We made the initial discovery that microglia, a resident central nervous system (CNS) macrophage, engulf and
eliminate less active synapses in the developing retinogeniculate and barrel cortex circuits. In the last funding
cycle, we showed that removal of whiskers on one side of the snout in neonates resulted in microglial engulfment
and elimination of thalamocortical (TC) synapses in the corresponding barrel cortex. Unlike the retinogeniculate
circuit, this was not regulated by complement. Instead, microglia failed to engulf and eliminate TC synapses in
mice deficient in neuronal fractalkine (CX3CL1)-to microglial fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) signaling. This work
established that diverse glial mechanisms regulate activity-dependent synapse remodeling and opened up new
questions: Do microglia remodel synapses in the adult brain? With evidence that astrocytes also engulf synapses
in other CNS circuits, are astrocytes also involved in barrel cortex synapse remodeling? If so, do they
communicate with microglia to regulate this process? Our new preliminary data show that astrocytes do not
engulf synapses in response to whisker removal in neonates, but rather they reduce their contact with synapses
in a CX3CL1-dependent manner. Also, microglia no longer engulf TC synapses following whisker removal in
older animals, concomitant with elevated astrocyte synapse ensheathment. Cell-specific RNAseq following
whisker removal further reveals canonical Wnt signaling as a putative mechanism by which microglia signal to
astrocytes to regulate synapse ensheathment. We now propose a novel model by which microglia regulate
astrocyte ensheathment of synapses in an activity and CX3CL1-CX3CR1-Wnt dependent manner. In turn,
microglia gain access to engulf and remove TC synapses. We will now leverage the power of the barrel cortex
circuit with cell-specific genetic approaches to: 1) Define the developmental window for CX3CL1-CX3CR1-
dependent microglial synapse engulfment and astrocyte synapse ensheathment (Aim 1). 2) Determine if
astrocyte ensheathment of synapses impacts microglia-dependent synapse remodeling (Aim 2). 3) Identify how
microglia regulate astrocyte ensheathment of synapses (Aim 3). Answers will address how some synapses are
eliminated by glia while others are left intact—a key open question in the field with implications for a variety of
neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases with underlying changes in synaptic
connectivity."
10837086,"Project Summary / Abstract
The Brown School at Washington University, together with the School of Medicine, is seeking an additional five
years (years 21-26) of support for a pre-doctoral and post-doctoral research training program, called
Transdisciplinary Training in Addictions Research (TranSTAR). Funded since 2002, this program reflects an
integration of social work and medicine in the development of services to, treatment of, clinical correlates of and
policies that affect underserved minority (racial, ethnic, sexual and gender) populations and those particularly
vulnerable to substance use disorders and co-occurring and comorbid conditions. Maximizing an effective
transdisciplinary collaboration between the two schools, the program provides a stimulating and collaborative
research training environment to produce exceptionally well-trained addictions researchers. Organized into four
cores (Substance Use and Mental Health, Populations, Translational, and Methods), TranSTAR faculty are
particularly well-suited for addressing challenging addiction research topics (e.g., polydrug users, non-treatment
seeking, incarcerated populations, mental health/health comorbidities) and populations disproportionately
impacted by social determinants of health including poverty, racism and discrimination, housing and educational
inequality. TranSTAR holds a stellar training record: 100% of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees who have
completed training in the most recent two funding cycles are addictions researchers, with excellent records of
publications and acquisition of funding. The record is similarly positive when the entire cohort of past trainees is
assessed. With a highly diverse training faculty, led by two faculty from social work/public health and psychiatry,
TranSTAR has demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining women and URM scholars; currently
predoctoral trainees are 67% women and 67% URM; diversity is also considerable among postdoctoral trainees
overall (58% women, 58% URM and other marginalized populations). Further, TranSTAR leverages successes
and ""lessons learned"" with on-going monitoring and evaluation to ensure that trainees (three pre- and two
postdocs/year) have the necessary knowledge and skills to: (1) conceptualize meaningful research questions
with practical service and policy implications; (2) execute rigorous, cutting-edge empirical studies; (3) develop
competitive grant applications suitable for NIDA and other NIH funding; and (4) translate and disseminate results
with potential for high impact. TranSTAR provides: (a) transdisciplinary and specialized substance misuse and
addictions coursework, workshops and seminars taught by leading faculty in social work, public health,
psychiatry, biostatistics, and the social sciences; (b) structured mentoring, advising, and ""hands-on"" experience
on addictions research projects for trainees; (c) proposal critique review sessions; (d) predoctoral teaching
assistantships in addictions, comorbidity, and other areas; (e) professional development sessions on
presentation skills, effective communication of research, and networking and effective collaborative team
science; (f) on-going training in rigor and reproducibility and in responsible conduct of research."
10782550,"The Dual bNAb Treatment in Children Study (“Tatelo”) is an ongoing phase I/II, multi-site clinical trial of dual 
treatment with two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs), VRC01LS and 10-1074, offered to 
HIV-1 infected virally suppressed children. The study is evaluating the efficacy of dual bNAbs for maintaining 
viral suppression in the absence of ART among virally suppressed HIV-infected children who started standard 
ART within 96 hours of birth (or soon after intrapartum infection). 
All children in the Tatelo Study were recruited from the Early Infant Treatment (EIT) study (U01AI114235), 
and have been followed from birth with frequent assessments of their clinical, virologic and immunologic 
characteristics. Children who received at least 96 weeks of ART and met virologic entry criteria were offered 
enrollment into the Tatelo Study. The intervention consisted of two PK and safety phases (single and then 
dual bNAbs), followed by the main study intervention (dual bNAbs plus ART for at least 8 weeks, then dual 
bNAbs alone for up to 24 weeks), and then a follow-up period when children were returned to ART alone. 
The study is designed to evaluate three possible benefits of dual bNAb therapy in HIV-1-infected children: 
1) to determine the duration of virologic control that can be maintained with dual bNAb treatment following 
early ART, providing proof-of-concept that bNAbs may serve as a possible alternative to standard ART in 
children with low viral reservoirs; 2) to investigate whether bNAb therapy is associated with changes in the 
size and/or the cellular or clonal composition of residual viral reservoirs, which will be highly informative for 
developing strategies to limit viral persistence and to destabilize viral reservoir homeostasis in pediatric 
patients; and 3) to evaluate whether treatment with bNAbs is associated with qualitative or quantitative 
changes in innate or adaptive antiviral immune responses, and if it facilitates the development of an 
antiviral immune profile that can enable spontaneous post-treatment viral control."
10800760,"This will be the first pediatric study with prime-boost HIVIS DNA and MVA-CMDR therapeutic vaccines. Our
goal is to develop therapeutic HIV vaccines to reduce the HIV reservoirs in children and youth with HIV. Our
scientific premise is that the prime-boost HIVIS DNA and MVA-CMDR vaccines induce cellular and humeral
immune responses important for clearing infected cells. They were selected for children based on ample
adult safety data. Early treated children are an ideal population to investigate therapeutic HIV vaccines
because of their healthy immunity and small HIV reservoirs. We will explore a novel strategy of giving a
licensed vaccine against human papilloma virus that contains toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist adjuvant to
boost immune responses to HIVIS DNA. Participants will be children from South Africa. The project was
conceptualized under the EPIICAL Consortium and will be conducted in collaboration with the U.S Military
HIV Research Program. EPIICAL does not provide any funding for this study but provides a platform for
sharing expertise, data and samples from cohorts that will propel the development of therapeutic
vaccine strategies for children forward.
A maximum of twenty-five participants will be enrolled in this 72-week study. Participants will be 9 to 25 years
old, have started HIV medications prior to 6 months of age and are virally suppressed. They will be randomly
assigned to HIV vaccines (n=10) vs. HIV vaccines+ TLR4 agonist (n=10) vs. control (no interventions) (n=5).
Vaccines will be given at weeks O and 4 for HIVIS DNA, weeks 0, 4 and 24 for TLR4 agonist, and weeks 24
and 36 for MVA-CMDR. We will extensively measure the changes of HIV reservoirs and immune responses
post interventions.
Aim 1: To quantitate and characterize the HIV reservoirs before and after HIVIS DNA ± TLR4 agonist and
MVA-CMDR vaccination
Aim 2: To characterize HIV-specific cellular and humeral immune responses before and after vaccination
and assess their relationship to the HIV reservoir endpoints.
The knowledge generated will contribute to the optimization of therapeutic HIV vaccine strategies and exert
sustained influence on HIV cure research for children and youth."

The goal of mitotic cell division is to produce two cells from one and to ensure that each daughter cell inherits
an exact copy of the original genetic material. When mitosis malfunctions, a common result is aneuploidy, in
which cells contain the incorrect number of chromosomes. This impacts human health, since aneuploidy is a
leading cause of birth defects and is implicated in cancer initiation and progression. The fidelity of mitosis
depends on kinetochores, which are structures built at defined regions of chromosomes called centromeres.
Kinetochores have several essential functions, including the following: (1) they connect chromosomes to spindle
microtubules, (2) they regulate the strength of these connections, and (3) they ensure that cells do not exit mitosis
if chromosomes are incorrectly attached to microtubules (via the spindle assembly checkpoint). Our lab focuses
on understanding kinetochores, and specifically how they establish and regulate attachments to microtubules.
Our lab also investigates how tumorigenesis results in kinetochore defects, and how these defects lead to cancer
cell-specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited for cancer therapies. The first two projects in the proposal aim
to uncover the mechanisms cells use to establish and regulate kinetochore-microtubule attachments in human
cells. Based on our recent findings, we have generated new hypotheses for how the Aurora family of kinases
(i.e., Aurora A, and Aurora B) impact kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability. A significant obstacle that has
hindered progress in understanding how kinetochore kinases precisely regulate kinetochore-microtubule
attachments is the lack of tools that permit unobtrusive tracking of the dynamics of these kinases and their
activities at kinetochores with high spatial and temporal resolution. We have overcome this by developing
methods to generate genetically-encoded, fluorescently-tagged, antibody-based probes that can be used to track
these phenomena in living cells. We will use this approach to generate phosphorylation “sensors” that recognize
active, phosphorylated forms of Aurora A and Aurora B kinases, as well probes directed to their target substate
sites at kinetochores. We will use these tools – and generate new ones – to discover how kinetochore kinases
regulate kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability throughout mitosis to ensure successful chromosome
segregation. A related project will address how kinetochore-microtubule attachment status is communicated to
the checkpoint. For this, we will employ our phospho-sensors, super-resolution imaging, and a newly-developed
in vitro chromosome capture assay. Finally, we made the recent discovery that hyperactive signaling by the RAS
and MAPK pathways over-stimulates kinetochore kinases to induce kinetochore defects and cancer cell-specific
vulnerabilities in laboratory-transformed cells and glioblastoma tumor isolates. We aim to identify the targets of
MAPK in mitosis and define new roles for RAS/MAPK signaling in dictating cancer vulnerabilities, with the long-
term goal of devising strategies to target kinetochore dysregulation in cancer cells for therapeutic intervention."

RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of gene expression. The mammalian genome encodes well
over 2,000 RBPs, exceeding the number of transcriptional regulators, and most of these RBPs are highly
conserved. RBPs are central to regulating all the stages of the RNA life cycle (e.g. transcription, processing,
transport, translation, degradation, etc.) and their regulatory function is important to all biological processes.
Moreover, RBPs form complex regulatory networks, where one RBP can regulate up to hundreds of target RNAs
and also several RBPs can interact with the same target RNA. This coordinated regulation of RNAs by RBPs in
time and space is thought to control many biological processes, such as cell fate determination and synaptic
plasticity. Therefore, in order to fully understand post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, it is crucial to
understand the molecular interactions of RBPs and how these interactions change throughout a physiological or
pathological process. Specifically, two kinds of molecular interactions define the functions of a given RBP: (1)
the set of RNAs that are targeted by a given RBP, and (2) other RBPs that function together with it by direct and
indirect (RNA-mediated) interactions.
As RBPs form this complex regulatory network, we need methods that allow us to measure the molecular
interactions of a large number of RBPs in parallel. However, current methods to characterize RBPs only map
the interaction of one RBP at a time, which make the effort of truly understanding their interplay and their impact
on post-transcriptional regulation challenging. Here I propose to use a set of novel approaches that my lab
recently developed, which will provide functional insight into molecular interactions of dozens to hundreds of
RBPs and their dynamic changes at a multi-lab consortia scale, but within a single lab, while preserving the data
quality of existing single gene approaches. We will: (1) Globally map protein protein interactions (PPI) for
hundreds of proteins at several time points during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation at sub-complex
resolution. (2) Determine which of these PPIs are RNA-dependent. (3) Determine how post-translational
modifications (PTMs) drive specific PPI changes at global coverage. (4) Characterize protein-RNA interactions
for up to a hundred of RBPs at several time points during ESC differentiation. (5) Integrate these datasets, which
will – together with focused follow-up experiments – provide functional insight about the dynamics of post-
transcriptional gene expression regulation during ESC differentiation.
Taken together, the proposed work aims to develop and apply approaches that will allow us to characterize RBP
function in a highly parallel manner in order to define the post-transcriptional regulatory circuitry that underlies
ESC differentiation into neurons."

RNA processing and degradation mechanisms play critical functions in the control of gene
expression. Not only do they regulate global transcripts abundance, but they also provide
quality control mechanisms to eliminate improperly processed or mis-localized transcripts.
Work in our laboratory focuses on two main aspects of RNA-based regulatory processes.
The first axis of research is focused on the function of nuclear ribonucleases and of nuclear
RNA degradation pathways. Nuclear RNA processing and degradation by the RNA
exosome, RNase III and the Rex exonucleases play important roles in ribosome
biogenesis and in controlling expression of genes in response to stress. Work presented
in this proposal will focus on determining the function of nuclear ribonucleases on
regulating the expression of key chromatin remodeling factors during stress and on
identifying the role of the cancer-linked ribonuclease Rexo4 in mammalian ribosomal RNA
processing. The second area of focus of our group is to understand the impact of splicing
inactivation on global gene expression. We have analyzed the function of splicing factors
in vivo using RNA sequencing and shown that splicing inactivation results in the
accumulation of hybrid mRNA-snoRNA (hmsnoRNAs) species which accumulate in the
cytoplasm. We will continue these studies by investigating the function of several
conserved splicing factors in global gene expression and by analyzing the global impact
of splicing inactivation on the proteome, including the translation of hmsnoRNAs. Overall,
the proposed studies are expected to have a high impact on our understanding of the
mechanisms by which post-transcriptional processes globally regulate gene expression."
10766702,"Anxiety disorders represent the most prevalent type of psychopathology across the lifespan. Fear/avoidance,
temperament precursors of anxiety symptoms, can be observed reliably in the first year of life. Thus, develop-
ment of fear, a critical component of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) negative valence constellation, is
important in its own right, and represents an early marker of anxiety symptoms. Fearful temperament has been
linked with a distinct neurophysiological signature – relative right frontal activation, detectable via electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) recording. Dynamic reciprocal effects between the left and right hemispheres contribute to
this asymmetry as well as associated behavioral states of fear/avoidance, and shape risk versus protection
with respect to anxiety. Maternal sensitivity not only effects fear development, but also moderates links be-
tween fear reactivity and anxiety symptoms. The present study addresses an important gap in research, exam-
ining reciprocal effects between changes in left and right frontal activation as a vehicle for transmission of anxi-
ety-related risk, along with fearful reactivity, considering maternal sensitivity as a moderator. It is hypothe-
sized that (1) dominance of right hemisphere change effects on left activation growth across infancy
and coupling of accelerated changes in infant fearfulness and shifts in the associated electrophysio-
logical signature will confer the risk for anxiety; (2) early maternal sensitivity will serve to attenuate
links between psychophysiological risk and anxiety, accentuating it later. The following specific aims are
proposed: Aim 1. Infant fearfulness: Modeling behavioral and EEG changes moderated by maternal sensitivity.
We will enroll mothers with infants (n=300) at three sites: Pullman, WA, Blacksburg, VA, and Jupiter, FL, re-
quired to provide racial/ethnic diversity in the overall sample recruited from otherwise demographically similar
communities, and because of data collection/processing demands associated with the longitudinal design. We
will conduct multi-method bimonthly assessments of infant fear from 6 to 18 months, relying on a planned
missingness design. Infant EEG will be recorded to measure frontal activation along with observations of ma-
ternal sensitivity. Dynamic latent change effects will be modeled for behavioral and EEG indicators, providing a
picture of development across infancy and setting the stage for Aim 2. Explaining anxiety onset: Contributions
of latent change in fear, electrophysiology, and sensitivity. Contributions of changes in fear and related electro-
physiology to the emergence of anxiety will be quantified, considering moderation of maternal sensitivity. Chil-
dren will be followed until 24 months of age, obtaining questionnaire and structured interview parent-report, as
well as observations of behavioral inhibition/anxious behaviors. Latent change scores for fear and frontal EEG
power on the left and the right will be modeled as predictors of anxiety, with maternal sensitivity as a moderator
of these links. Completion of the proposed evaluation is expected to clarify the role of fear development and
maternal sensitivity in the onset of anxiety symptoms, informing preventative efforts (e.g., parent training)."

Dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons is strongly associated with neurological
disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Although recent evidence
highlights bewildering subtype diversity of these neurons, the notion that developmental perturbations in
subtype function cause defects in the formation of cortical circuits with lasting functional deficits has not been
explored in detail. The long-term goal of this research is to uncover how early interneuron dysfunction in the
developing postnatal brain leads to lasting neurological pathologies. The objective of this proposal is to reveal
how the activity of specific interneuron populations during critical windows of perinatal development shape
circuits underlying primary sensory-dependent behavior.
To this end, we will use the murine barrel cortex as a well-established model for the study of activity-dependent
circuit maturation. We will focus our studies in superficial circuits since our previous work indicates that these
circuits are exquisitely sensitive to environmental perturbations in the neonate. In the near term, this proposal
is aimed at investigating the role of layer I interneuron subtypes in regulating the emergence of cortical
columns (Aim 1). In addition, this project will determine the role of LI interneurons in the emergence of
interhemispheric circuits. (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess how developmental defects in early LI interneuron
function lead to abnormal brain activity and impaired sensory integration in the adult (Aim 3).
With respect to the outcomes, our work is expected to identify basic mechanisms fundamental for the
emergency of a healthy excitatory/inhibitory balance. In addition, these results are expected to have a
significant translational impact because they will expand our mechanistic knowledge on how early interneuron
dysfunction may lead to behavioral abnormalities frequently observed in ASD patients."

Aging of skeletal muscle results in sarcopenia. It is believed that sarcopenia is in part due to a decreased capacity
of stem cells, namely satellite cells, to repair the skeletal muscle after injury. Satellite cells are the major source
of myogenic progenitors for adult muscle homeostasis and repair. A potential alternative for dysfunctional
satellite cells is induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) which have the capacity to differentiate into skeletal muscle
myocytes and blood vessels. Here, we have identified a highly efficient small molecule, givinostat (Givi), a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) which is capable of transforming human iPSC into myogenic progenitor cells (MPC)
that are highly proliferative and generate large numbers of extracellular vesicles (EV). Our “pharmacological
reprogramming” approach using small molecules to generate MPC in a limited period of time and without use of
viral vectors is a very significant step forward in cell-based therapy. We are proposing that iPSC
pharmacologically reprogrammed into MPC with Givi will be optimally effective to regenerate sarcopenic muscle.
In specific aim 1, the hypothesis that induced myogenic progenitor cells (iMPC) from iPSC with novel small
molecules are effective and safe for regeneration of aged muscle will be tested; In specific Aim 2, the hypothesis
that accelerated mobilization and engraftment of iMPC in an aged muscle microenvironment stimulate muscle
regeneration will be tested; In specific Aim 3, the hypothesis that EV derived from Givi-induced MPC rejuvenate
aged muscle and augment muscle regeneration will be tested. If many of the regenerative properties of iMPC
can be credited to EV, there will be a paradigm shift in regenerative medicine to enable endogenous self-repair
in sarcopenia by cell to cell transfer of proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs (miRs) by EV. EV from engineered or
modified stem cells are highly enriched with bioactive molecules including myogenic miRs responsible for
activation of signaling pathways important in muscle regeneration. These studies will involve multidisciplinary
approaches which will employ state of the art molecular biology, biochemical, histochemical,
immunohistochemical techniques and integrative physiology involving well established experimental animal
model and muscle function. This proposal is conceptually innovative because it addresses the structural and
molecular characterization of iMPC and their EV and tests their role as key biological messengers of iMPC action
in the treatment of sarcopenia."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It currently affects 5 million people in the U.S.,
a number that is expected to rise to a staggering 16 million by 2050. AD not only deprives patients of their basic
mental functions, but severely batters families and caregivers. Its annual costs are currently estimated at $236
billion, and will likely increase to more than $1 trillion by 2050. As our society rapidly ages, the need to combat
AD grows increasingly pressing. Histological and imaging studies in AD patients and animal models have shown
that the entorhinal cortex is a primary site of atrophy and activity loss in the early phases of AD. Inside the
entorhinal cortex, neurons in layer II are known to undergo earliest neurodegeneration. However, it is still largely
unclear what cell type in layer II of the entorhinal cortex exhibits such neurodegeneration. Our preliminary results
and recent literature suggest a possibility that layer II neurons show cell-type-specific vulnerability to
neurodegeneration. Here we propose studies to characterize the cell-type-specific neurodegeneration of layer II
neurons in the entorhinal cortex, and to investigate the circuit mechanisms by which cell-type-specific cell death
causes memory impairment in AD. Our approach involves cell-type-specific histological analyses, cell-type-
specific in vivo recording of spike activity, cell-type-specific optogenetic and chemogenetic methods, and a novel
APP knock-in mouse model. There are three Specific Aims: (Aim 1) To identify histological and molecular
properties of degenerating entorhinal cortex neuronal types in APP-KI mice; (Aim 2) To identify in vivo
electrophysiological spike activities of entorhinal cortex cell types; and (Aim 3) To determine the effect of
entorhinal neurodegeneration on hippocampal place cell activity and on memory loss of APP knock-in mice. If
successful, our studies will identify cellular and circuit mechanisms of cell-type-specific neurodegeneration in the
entorhinal cortex in AD. Such knowledge of entorhinal cell-type-specific vulnerability is expected to be a
breakthrough for future identification of therapeutic targets to prevent or slow AD progression."

This proposal addresses a significant barrier to obtaining treatment for college-age youth with mental disorders. Many college-age youth with impairing mental disorders remain untreated because of concerns about stigma and privacy, inconvenience and wait times, and because universities are often unable to service all such students. Also, of critical importance, when referral for treatment is implemented, it is without regard to the person's pathology, because of the erroneous assumption that treatment need not be tailored lo the individual. This proposal aims to address this critical clinical issue. We advance that a sophisticated automated online referral system would resolve all of these problems, but there is no expert-trained system for psychiatric referrals. We propose to automate the referral process, designed for college-age youth, by bridging online, mental health assessments and curated, up-to-date, mental health provider networks. To this end, the non-profit Child Mind Institute is partnering with the for-profit MiResource. Assessment expertise is provided by the Child Mind Institute, which treats children and adolescents with mental health disorders, conducts mental health research, has acquired large assessment datasets, has in-house expertise in mental health assessment, and through its MATTER Lab has developed novel assessment technologies such as the MindLogger data collection and assessment platform. Referral infrastructure is provided by MiResource, a software-as-a-service solution designed to help universities connect students to local mental health providers. The MATTER Lab and MiResource will develop an automated online assessment and referral platform that uses expert-trained machine learning to provide users with personalized referrals for mental health care. Expert referrals will be based on the six dimensions of the Level of Care Utilization System (risk of harm, functional status, comorbidity, environment, treatment history, and attitude) applied to college students' responses to mental health assessments. In Phase I, we will (1-1) build mental health assessments into the MindLogger platform, (1-2) build an expert referral collection interface, and (1-3) set up a machine learning pipeline for training and testing an updatable classification model for automated clinically appropriate, personalized referrals. In Phase II, we will build, refine, and clinically validate our product for commercialization. Specifically, we will (11-1) validate the Phase I framework on a university population, (11-2) integrate Mindlogger's assessments into MiResource, and (11-3) conduct usability and quality assurance tests of the new Mindlogger plus MiResource platform, to get feedback about issues related to accessibility, relevance, accuracy, and esthetics, and incorporate solutions in response to this feedback into a final version."

This is a renewal application for a high successful program designed to attract and train both predoctoral and
postdoctoral investigators in basic investigation of childhood diseases related to cardiovascular and pulmonary
biology. The need for a training program in the cellular and molecular basis of cardiovascular and pulmonary
disease, especially of physician scientists interested in childhood diseases, is based upon clear evidence of a
declining national pool of such individuals at both the faculty and trainee levels. Currently, few pediatric
cardiology or pulmonary fellowship programs in American medical centers provide adequate training in this
area of research, either at the bench or in structured clinical investigation. Our program is designed to address
this need from two important perspectives: 1) To allow pediatric and other clinical fellows with an interest in
basic research to develop research competence and career training; 2) To attract and train talented basic
scientists at the pre- and post-doctoral levels to study mechanisms related to cardiorespiratory disease in
childhood. Our program has been shaped by feedback from reviewers of the previous program, by advice from
our faculty and program advisors, by past trainees, and by the inclusion of new faculty and core programs at
Washington University that allow us to expand the training experience of our trainees. In addition to continuing
our strong training in developmental/cell biology and the molecular basis of disease, the proposed program will
take advantage of institutional strengths in genetics, stem cell biology, genomics, and bioinformatics—all of
which are components of the foundation of modern research. In addition, we have a newly incorporated focus
on infection of the cardiorespiratory system, a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. We
have maintained a training curriculum for 4 postdoctoral and 2 predoctoral fellows with an uninterrupted 2-3
year block of full-time investigation. This focus is enhanced by a multidisciplinary core of didactic seminars,
journal clubs and formal coursework that are designed for each trainee through consultation with the
mentor/program administrators to provide individualized education in key aspects of cardiopulmonary
development and disease. Our objectives are: 1) to provide extensive mentoring to the trainee for career
development and for developing independent research plans that focus on pediatric diseases; 2) to promote
training in basic cell and molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics together with clinical translational
research; and 3) to guide our trainees’ development so that, after the completion of training, successful
competition for independent funding is likely."

Liver disease is a growing clinical problem in the United States and worldwide affecting 30 million Americans
resulting in 750,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths yearly. Unfortunately, unlike other common diseases
such as cardiovascular diseases, the incidence of liver disease and its associated complications are
increasing. Given the steady rise of patients with liver disease, the demand for liver transplantation has
continued to increase while the supply of organs has remained unchanged creating a pressing need to address
this organ scarcity. Proposed alternatives to organ transplantation are the transplantation of cells but human
hepatocytes are similarly difficult to source. As a result, there are currently no alternatives for obtaining robust
functional hepatocytes which is significantly hampering scientific study and the development of more effective
clinical therapies; our work addresses this significant research and clinical gap. Pluripotent stem cell derived
hepatocyte-like cells are often cited as a potential alternative cell source for organ transplants and as a
platform for pharmaceutical and scientific study. However, the current inability to derive robust and fully mature
hepatocytes limits the clinical and scientific utility of currently produced cells. Pluripotent stem cell fate and
hepatocyte maturation is determined by the complex array of internal signals and external cues from the
microenvironment. Unfortunately our current differentiation platforms do not mimic the cellular, extracellular
matrix (ECM), and 3D complexities of the in vivo hepatic microenvironment and therefore the role of ECM-cell
and cell-cell interactions in the differentiation process remains largely unknown. Our central hypothesis is that
the 3D microenvironment and subsequent cellular interactions (e.g. cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions) dictates
cell fate decisions and it is through these factors by which fetal cell types mature into terminally differentiated
cell types. In recent work our group has developed robust tools to systematically and efficiently manipulate the
3D microenvironment. The central goal of this proposal is to identify and examine important inductive cellular
interactions for directed pluripotent stem cell differentiation in vitro to enable the generation of phenotypically
and functionally mature hepatocytes. We will systematically examine and identify the role cell-cell and cell-
ECM interactions play in regulating the fetal to adult hepatocyte transition and will incorporate these findings
into our current differentiation and tissue engineered constructs. These optimized 3D multicellular spheroids
platforms will enable scientific study and the development of more effective clinical therapies."
10765163,"Project Summary/Abstract
A key step in animal germ cell development is the switch in fate from stem/progenitor cells to entering meiotic
prophase en route to gametogenesis. Disruption of this switch results in infertility and/or aneuploidy. Conserved
features of the developmental transition include stem cell self-renewal followed by initiation of the meiotic
program (e.g., homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, double strand break formation) and repression of
mitotic cell cycling. Multiple pathways function in control of the switch, resulting in genetic redundancy that has
impeded the identification of key regulators. Furthermore, the regulatory process is heavily reliant on
posttranscriptional control mechanisms. Studies of this switch in animals have progressed farthest in C. elegans.
This is in part because the developmental transitions follow a convenient spatial continuum, allowing facile
analysis of changes in cellular state (e.g. levels of regulators, changes in chromosome behavior) in wild type and
mutant backgrounds. We have identified three parallel redundant pathways that control the switch in C. elegans.
Yet, important questions remain.
 How is the switch spatially controlled? Here we focus on one of the pathways, the SCFPROM-1 pathway,
an E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions in protein degradation. SCFPROM-1 induces meiotic entry and inhibits mitotic
cell cycling, and its activity is controlled by PROM-1 proteins levels that rise from a base in stem cells to a peak
at meiotic entry. Proposed studies of the spatial control will uncover how the activity and function of SCFPROM-1
is regulated and is coordinated with the other two known pathways, how meiotic entry is repressed in stem cells,
and how mitotic cell cycling is repressed at meiotic entry.
 What are the missing regulators that execute the switch? The regulatory network contains significant
genetic redundancy and there is evidence for missing regulators. Leveraging a novel in vivo genetic system we
developed to synchronously switch stem cells to meiotic entry, we are employing genome-wide integrated
transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics, followed by genetic functional analysis to identify missing
regulators. This combined genomics and genetically targeted functional analysis will overcome genetic
redundancy in the developmental switch, which is difficult in less tractable organisms.
 Our overall goal is to complete the regulatory network and delineate processes governing an essential
step in germline development, which will inform studies in other animals. Our investigations will uncover new
developmental, cellular and molecular principles that are important for human health. This fundamental basic
research in a genetic model organism will produce foundational knowledge for understanding cell fate switches,
as well as the origin of birth defects and fertility."
10766735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute inflammatory lung diseases affect over 450 million people worldwide each year. Pathologic hallmarks
include neutrophil accumulation, alveolar epithelial and endothelial cell injury, and loss of epithelial-capillary
integrity. For alveolar repair to occur, inflammation must be halted, debris and inflammatory cells removed,
injured tissue cells replaced, and capillary barrier function re-established. Macrophages are key players in all of
these. The primary objective of this proposal is to create a Program in Lung Macrophage Biology that will
determine how lung macrophages are programmed to halt inflammation and promote alveolar repair.
A concept at the heart of the proposal is that of macrophage subsets. During health, the airspaces are
occupied by a stable population of resident alveolar macrophages (RAM) that arise during embryogenesis and
self-renew throughout life. RAMs remain during inflammation but are joined by recruited macrophages (RecM)
that mature from circulating monocytes. These RecM remain in the lungs until alveolar function is restored, and
then in most cases undergo apoptosis. However, in certain situations RecM escape apoptosis. We have shown
that this is associated with the development of fibrosis.
The precise roles played by RAMs vs RecM in the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair
remain largely unknown. However, our data suggest that their respective roles are very different. In this
context, the Program in Lung Macrophage Biology will explore 3 complementary themes. Theme 1 tests the
hypothesis that RecM apoptosis is essential for the resolution of inflammation and that delayed apoptosis leads
to fibrosis. The mechanisms that regulate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and the intracellular proteins that
block it will be studied. Theme 2 tests the hypothesis that binding of airway-derived mucins to Siglecs (a class
of sialic acid-binding receptors with immunoinhibitory function) expressed on macrophages calibrates
macrophage inflammatory responses. Theme 3 provides a tight link with the other themes and explores how
cellular metabolism regulates macrophage inflammatory and pro-reparative functions and how it regulates
survival of macrophage subsets. In this context, we propose that RecM preferentially use glycolysis as an
energy source, whereas RAMs have increased utilization of the TCA cycle. HIF-1a is stabilized in RecM and is
viewed as a central metabolic regulator. The 3 themes are further linked by their focus on differential functions
of RAM vs RecM, the utilization of fresh human macrophages and shared use of cutting edge technologies.
The Program leverages a multidisciplinary team of highly accomplished investigators, novel transgenic animal
systems that we have developed, and a strong clinical research component. The latter includes whole human
lungs obtained from donors that died with ARDS, bronchoscopy specimens from patients with ARDS, and LPS
exposure studies with healthy human volunteers."
10767271,"Six percent of women under 44 are infertile, 12% have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying pregnancies to term, and over 75% of failed pregnancies involve implantation defects. Endometriosis, afflicting more than 10% of women of reproductive age, is a major cause of infertility, but its etiology is unclear. Therefore, identification of mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis-related infertility are critical. We have evidence that HDAC3 attenuation is implicated in infertile women with endometriosis. Induced endometriosis animal models involving baboons and mice showed a significant reduction of HDAC3 during the progression of endometriosis. Uterine-specific Hdac3 knock-out mice were sterile due to a defect of implantation and decidualization. In this proposal, our central hypothesis is that HDAC3 maintains steroid hormone regulation for endometrial functions, and HDAC3 loss causes infertility due to defects of implantation and decidualization. Our objective is to help solve infertility and endometrial diseases by revealing how HDAC3 functions in the uterus, and how epigenetic regulation and ovarian steroid hormone signaling are correlated. First, we will determine the pathophysiological role of HDAC3. Second, we will determine the effects of HDAC3 loss on endometriosis-related infertility. The proposed study will motivate the development of preclinical drug therapies for infertility and endometriosis and provide evidence of the molecular link between HDAC3 and steroid hormone signaling in order to accelerate evaluation of an emerging therapy against early pregnancy loss."

Developing extracellular vesicle-mediated targeted microRNA delivery system for EGFR cancers
Project Summary
Targeted therapy acts on a well-defined molecular mechanism of disease pathologies within a tissue or cells.
However, many clinical trials encountered insufficient efficacy or safety issues due to accumulating in unwanted
organs or off-target effects. One such molecule, microRNA(miRNA), is a small non-coding RNA that plays a
critical role in tumor biology, including tumor progression, drug resistance, and metastasis, through sequence-
specific translational regulation. While miRNAs hold a promising therapeutic potential, the adverse events
resulting from severe immunogenic responses terminated the clinical trials. Thus, an efficient delivery system is
essential to establishing miRNA therapy. This project aims to establish a targeted therapeutic miRNA delivery
system using engineered cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are the body's natural biomolecular
transporters that could overcome various issues associated with existing delivery systems. Specifically, we will
engineer EV surface with antibody mimetics (monobody) to target Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
cancer to deliver tumor suppressor miRNAs. We hypothesize that EVs can efficiently deliver miRNAs into EGFR+
cells, where the miRNAs will exert powerful anti-tumor effects. Following the EV generation, we will demonstrate
that these miRNA packaging EVs will have EGFR tumor specificity and anti-tumor effects. This will build a
foundation for EV-based targeted delivery of miRNA-based therapies. We expect our approach to offer new
possibilities for cancer treatment by utilizing EVs with low immunogenicity, cytotoxicity, and efficient miRNA
release. These validations will empower and accelerate the development of EV-based targeted therapeutic
delivery."
10918207,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of the ECHO Ohio Cohort Site at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University Wexner
Medical Center (NCH-OSUWMC) is to contribute to the ECHO Cohort by collecting and providing valuable data
on a diverse and often underserved population of participating pregnant individuals, conceiving partners, and
children who live in our region, so we can improve maternal and child health everywhere by better understanding
how exposures prior to and during pregnancy impact childhood outcomes. Nearly 1/5 of Ohio’s children live in
poverty. The rate is more than twice that for non-Hispanic Black children. Central Ohio is diverse with a rapidly
growing immigrant population including the largest ethnic Nepali and 2nd largest Somali refugee populations in
the U.S.; 1 in 6 Columbus children have an immigrant parent. The patients we serve live not only in urban,
suburban, and rural central Ohio, but also within Appalachian portions of southeast Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
West Virginia. The communities we serve are ranked poorly across multiple maternal and child health well-being
indicators, underscoring a critical need to better understand environmental influences in the perinatal period that
contribute to adverse child outcomes both locally and nationally. The NCH-OSUWMC health system is highly
experienced in contributing to large multicenter NIH studies involving pregnant individuals and children and well-
poised to contribute interdisciplinary leadership. We have maintained a large perinatal repository of clinical,
survey, and rich biospecimen data from pregnant individuals, their partners, and their children for over a decade.
Our research coordinators and investigators are highly experienced in recruiting both pregnant individuals and
children for research investigations and securely and efficiently processing health data and biospecimens. Of
note, our track record in retaining diverse subpopulations of high-risk maternal/child dyads, as well as conceiving
partners, for follow-up is strong. We provide specific expertise in evaluating lifestyle exposures in pregnancy,
most prominently in maternal cardiovascular health, and outcomes expertise in pre-, peri-, and postnatal health
and childhood neurodevelopment. We propose 1) evaluating the impact of maternal cardiovascular health during
pregnancy using the American Heart Association Life’s Essential 8 framework on child socioemotional
development and behavior to age 21, using existing ECHO Cohort Protocol core data elements and 2)
investigating, using innovative methods (continuous glucose monitoring), the association between evolving
maternal dysglycemia patterns across the peripartum period and child socioemotional development and behavior
while evaluating neonatal anthropometrics as potential mediators. We propose to evaluate the interaction
between genes and lifestyle exposures on socioemotional development via an association study complemented
with imputed -omics data. In a preconception-focused aim, we propose examining the impact of maternal and
paternal preconception cardiovascular health on socioemotional development and behavior. Our contributions
to the ECHO cohort, providing diversity and expertise, will enhance knowledge leading to improved child health."

Rationale: To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.
Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and modeling the
data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are desperately needed.
This project supports interdisciplinary graduate training programs in computational neuroscience (TPCN) at
both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in
computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are available to students coming from colleges and
universities throughout the United States.
 Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a world leader and innovator in quantitative fields such as
machine learning, computer science, and artificial intelligence, and recently, neuroscience has emerged as a
field for strategic growth at the university. The University of Pittsburgh is renowned for the strength of its clinical
and biomedical research programs. The TPCN is set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary environment of
our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by CMU and Pitt. The CNBC
was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural mechanisms of brain function, and
now comprises 162 faculty having appointments in 32 departments.
Goals: The goals of the TPCN are to:
 1) Support computational training of PhD students across the neurosciences,
 2) Broaden accessibility for students historically underrepresented in STEM by augmenting an existing
 MS-to-PhD training program that prepares them for advanced graduate training in computational
neuroscience,
 3) Expand computational training of undergraduate students through a formal academic minor in
 computational neuroscience,
 4) Support an undergraduate summer program that combines a two-week “boot-camp” overview of
 computational neuroscience with an 8-week research experience,
 5) Create online materials that not only serve our own students but are publicly available on the web, and
 6) Enhance our recruitment through relationships we have developed with minority-serving institutions."
10889266,"Project Summary: Acute Cardiac Injuries (ACIs) occur in up to 20-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and
are associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 has been shown to induce immune
system “overfiring” and “misfiring”, resulting in supraphysiological inflammation. Such cytokine storms have been
shown to lead to organ damage through both direct cytokine insults and indirect mechanisms (e.g., recruitment
of proinflammatory immune cells into organs). Myocarditis (e.g., monocyte infiltration) is a common complication
in COVID-19 ACI hearts. However, the impacts of the infiltrated monocytes on COVID-19 ACI hearts remain
under-defined. As previous studies have been limited to either clinical samples (e.g., peripheral blood,
autopsy/biopsy tissues) or in vitro 2D co-culture experiments, these studies yield limited functional insights. 3D
organotypic models provide a powerful platform to study the functional interactions between hearts and
immune cells in circulation. To develop an organotypic model of human hearts for disease modeling, we
developed 3D human cardiac organoids composed of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
(hPSC-CMs), human cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and stromal cells. Our preliminary data showed the
Interleukin (IL)-1b treated organoids recapitulated key features of transcriptome, structure, and function of
COVID-19 ACI hearts. As IL-1b is not a COVID-19 specific stimulus, these results laid the foundation to use
serum from COVID-19 ACI patients to recapitulate the COVID-19 cytokine insults to the hearts. In addition, the
exclusion of immune cells in the organoids has limited the full recapitulation of hyperinflammation in COVID-19
ACI hearts. The goal of this proposal is to leverage the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs)
harvested from COVID-19 ACI patients to 1) simulate the effects of COVID-19 cytokine insults on human hearts,
2) develop the first in vitro COVID-19 myocarditis organoid model to simulate immune cell infiltration to
COVID-19 ACI hearts and assess the infiltrated COVID-19 monocytes. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that infiltrated COVID-19 immune cells (e.g., monocytes) exacerbate the hyperinflammation of COVID-19 ACI
hearts. This proposal is innovative in that it will, for the first time, develop an organotypic model of myocarditis
to simulate immune cell infiltration into myocardium. Accordingly, we will pursue the following 2 Aims: 1)
Determine the effects of COVID-19 ACI serum on human cardiac organoids, and 2) Determine the ability of
COVID-19 ACI serum treated organoids to recruit immune cells from COVID-19 ACI patients. The proposed
studies will lead to follow-up R01 applications focusing on the effects and mechanisms of the infiltrated
monocytes in COVID-19 ACI hearts. In addition, the 3D organotypic model of myocarditis can be used for
mechanistic studies of the effects of immunomodulatory drugs on hearts."

To address the lack of diversity in the science, technology, engineering, and math
(STEM) workforce, the UMB IMSD program aims to increase the participation of
underrepresented minorities (URs) in biomedical PhD programs, increase their retention
rates, and provide career development to prepare these students for a future career in
STEM. UR participation and retention in graduate school is hampered by multiple
factors. Institutional environment, the lack of a large cohort, and encountering racial
microaggressions are all contributing factors to UR attrition in PhD programs. Further, a
lack of strong mentoring connections is also a mitigating factor. To address these
issues, the UMB IMSD will provide programming to increase retention and better
prepare these students for their future careers. The program will provide workshops on
scientific writing and provide opportunities for students to hone their presentation skills.
Workshops on stress management, mindfulness, and dealing with microaggressions will
also be provided. To strengthen student-mentor relationships, faculty will be provided
workshops to educate them on the unique challenges that UR students face and open
discussions between faculty and students will be carried out. Trainees will be educated
on the various career tracks in the STEM field via a Diversity Seminar series. The IMSD
plans to recruit 10 students per year and trainees will be appointed for one year, their
first year of graduate school. This program will help students transition to successful
careers in the STEM workforce."
10779115,"Nucleoside modified RNA-based drugs (modRNA) are a powerful new class of medicine. One type of modRNA, RNA vaccines, has been pivotal in immunization to SARS-CoV-2. modRNA is delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNP), and antigen presented by whichever cells take up and expresses the modRNA. The identity and phenotypic state of cells presenting antigen directs how T cells become activated and differentiate. FDA-approved LNPs for modRNA delivery are not cell specific, resulting in expression in pAPCs, hepatocytes, myocytes, and other cells. The contributions of different transfected cell types to the immune response to modRNA-encoded proteins is not known. This is an important question because antigen presentation by some cell types may work against therapeutic goals. 
While there are efforts to alter LNP organ distribution, precisely tailored cell specificity is still not feasible. We previously developed a technology that enables highly effective cell type specific silencing of vector-expressed RNA. We showed target sites for miRNA (miRT) could be incorporated into the 3’UTR of a transgene, and when the transgene is expressed in cell types that encodes the cognate miRNA, transgene expression is suppressed. Work by numerous labs, including ours, has demonstrated miRT can de-target vector expression from many cell types, including hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, pAPC, stem cells, and neurons. Preliminary and published data indicate that adding target sites for miR-142 (142T) or miR-122 (122T) to modRNA silences modRNA expression in hematopoietic cells or hepatocytes, respectively, demonstrating the technology can be used to control modRNA expression. Our objective is to use miRT to generate modRNA with tailored cell expression patterns and apply miRT to determine how modRNA expression in specific cell types directs immunity to modRNA-encoded protein. We hypothesize modRNA expression in non-pAPCs, such as hepatocytes, reduces immunity to modRNA-encoded proteins by presenting antigen in a tolerogenic context, and this lowers vaccine efficacy but can be exploited for tolerance. We will generate and test miRT for silencing modRNA in different cell types, including endothelium & myocytes, and determine how modRNA expression in different transfected cells, such as hepatocytes, influences immunity to modRNA antigen. 
The outcome of this project will establish novel modRNA configurations that tailor expression of proteins to specific cell types and determine how expression in specific cell types directs immunity to modRNA-encoded protein."
10781565,"Cardiomyopathies are a significant cause of death and morbidity with limited treatment options. A
substantial fraction (30-60%) of these cardiomyopathies has been identified as “diseases of the
sarcomere” having their origin in point mutations in sarcomeric proteins leading to dysregulation of acto-
myosin interactions with consequent functional deficits. Current therapies are mostly not disease
specific and focus on symptoms rather than on mitigating the root causes in sarcomere dysregulation.
Muscle contractility is governed by both the classic and extensively studied Ca2+-mediated thin filament-
based regulatory mechanism and newly discovered, but very poorly understood, thick filament based
regulatory mechanisms. In this proposal, our over-arching hypothesis is that thick filament regulatory
mechanisms are critical modulators of muscle function. Improved understanding of these mechanisms
will identify novel drug targets, and the desired characteristics of therapeutic compounds, that are
necessary to mitigate the structural and functional defects underlying myocardial pathophysiology. We
have demonstrated that porcine myocardium, the closest model system for human hearts, is an
excellent experimental system for our proposed structural and functional driven studies, with the
expected findings readily extrapolatable to humans. We propose to investigate the structural,
biochemical, and mechanical aspects of thick filament regulation mechanisms from porcine
myocardium. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will decouple classical Ca2+ dependent thin filament-based
regulation from the newly discovered Ca2+ dependent thick filament-based regulation mechanism by
exchanging the native troponin complex with exogenous D65A troponin complex that abolishes Ca2+
binding capability to reveal the details of molecular mechanism and the physiological significance of
this mechanism. In Aim 2, we will evaluate thick filament backbone stiffness from both actively
contracted and passively stretched porcine myocardium to investigate the underlying mechanisms of
myofilament length dependent activation. In Aim 3, we will interrogate the structural, biochemical and
mechanical consequences of porcine myocardium in response to PKA treatment. Finally, in Aim 4, we
will extend the new findings regarding thick filament regulatory pathways in healthy porcine myocardium
to the pathological basis of thick filament dysregulation in hypertrophic, dilated and restrictive
cardiomyopathies (HCM, DCM and RCM respectively) model porcine hearts. Results are expected to
have immediate translational relevance by identifying potential therapeutic targets for sarcomere-based
cardiomyopathies."
10917273,"ABSTRACT
 Due to the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART), AIDS is now rare - instead HIV has
become a chronic disease in much of the industrial world. Persons over 50 with controlled HIV (PWH) make up
nearly half of all infected individuals (>0.6M people in the US alone) and their numbers are increasing. But
these people are not cured: PWH experience multiple comorbid conditions at rates higher than, and earlier in
life compared to, uninfected age-matched persons. These HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions (HANA) lead to
premature accumulation of physical and cognitive functional deficits that resemble a pronounced/ accelerated
aging phenotype. Inflammation and immune function decline accompany both HIV and aging, suggesting that
both could potentiate and/or drive aspects of exacerbated aging in PWH. Persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infection has been implicated in immune aging and age-related inflammation too, but there are significant inter-
person variations and an incomplete understanding of control of CMV with aging. Limited data suggests that
the premature “aging” phenotype seen in PWH is only found in those co-infected with CMV, but the control of
CMV in PWH remains poorly understood. Therefore, CMV could be a driver of disabilities in older HIV+
individuals, a marker with stratifying and predictive value, or neither. We have developed a battery of tests to
measure CMV viral load, anti-CMV NK, T and B cell immunity, and concurrent levels of systemic inflammation,
and have found that while <50% of HIV-negative participants exhibit anti-CMV neutralizing Ab (nAb), >90%
HIV+ age-matched participants develop nAb. We hypothesize that anti-CMV nAb production is a direct function
of CMV load and replication during, and maybe also in the aftermath, of the acute HIV infection. We have also
developed and validated the upper extremity flexion (UEF) test that, coupled with cognitive testing, can provide
simultaneous assessment of frailty, motility, cardiovascular and cognitive function, all of which provide deep
functional insight into quality of life (QOL) and geriatric syndromes. We seek to use these tools to evaluate the
impact of CMV and CMV-associated inflammation as biomarkers in predicting trajectories of functional decline
in HIV+ individuals with aging. Our hypothesis is that PWH with signs of CMV reactivation (viral loads, high
levels of anti-CMV nAb, T and NK cell activation) experienced prolonged and high CMV reactivation during
acute HIV disease and/or in its aftermath, with a broad spectrum of immune and inflammatory abnormalities,
that predispose them for aggravated chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes such as frailty, mobility/falls
and reduced cognitive ability. We will test this hypothesis by multivariate analysis of immune and inflammatory
mediators and geriatric assessment in three observational (one prospective) and one anti-CMV drug treatment
cohort, including both sexes. This work will dissect the relationship between CMV, inflammation and reduced
overall fitness, frailty and accelerated and/or unsuccessful aging in HIV+ individuals and could provide basis
for broader anti-CMV treatment of older adults with HIV to improve their healthspan."

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting over 50 million people worldwide, with majority from low-
middle income countries (LMICs). In spite of advances in treatment of epilepsy (anti-epileptic drugs and other
biological therapies), many people with epilepsy (PWE) continue to have poor quality of life (QOL), suffer from
epilepsy associated stigma and diminished mental well-being. Risk factors for poorly controlled epilepsy include;
limited social support, poor medication adherence, stigma and comorbidities like depression and substance
abuse. People with epilepsy, especially in LMIC settings, face additional challenges such as social isolation,
limited access to care and low levels of epilepsy awareness, all of which impede help-seeking and exacerbate
epilepsy symptoms and poor quality of life related to epilepsy.
 Implementation of epilepsy self-management which incorporates ongoing assessment of treatment
response is the focus of this application. This application is written in response to PAR-22-097 Global Brain and
Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan, and builds upon promising pilot work in which this
study team adopted and utilized a culturally acceptable guided self-management curriculum called Self–
MAnagement for people with epilepsy and a histoRy of negative health evenTs in Uganda (SMART-U).
Preliminary work by this study team suggests that SMART-U has excellent participant acceptability, with 87.5%
retention over a 2-year period, and is associated with improved QOL and reduced stigma, depression and seizure
frequency. The lack of demonstrable efficacy under rigorous control makes it plausible for an efficacy RCT
building on pilot findings to see if SMART adds incremental clinical outcomes to PWE.
 The proposed project will refine the SMART-U intervention and ensure acceptability across a broad range
of Ugandans with epilepsy and then test the effects of SMART-U intervention in improving quality of life and
reducing seizure frequency, stigma and depression and in a two site, prospective, 104–month randomized
controlled trial (RCT). We will also investigate the use of short message service (SMS) delivered via mobile
phone text to validate patient self-reported seizure occurrence and push epilepsy self-management messaging
in a practical/accessible format in SMART vs. eTAU in an LMIC. In line with Fogarty International Center (FIC)
and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) priorities, the proposal will build critical
research capacity for future epilepsy burden reduction. Finally, the project will grow research capacity in epilepsy
and help establish sustainable infrastructure that will facilitate future scale up of SMART in Uganda with epilepsy
partners. Taken together, the proposed project has substantial public health importance and will provide
prerequisite data and infrastructure needed to help reduce the burden of epilepsy in Uganda and other LMICs
across the globe."

Bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer per capita to treat in the US. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC) which accounts for 70-75% of all newly diagnosed tumors only has a single FDA approved first-line
treatment option, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). BCG has been the only approved first-line therapy for
intermediate and high-risk NMIBC for more than 40 years. While BCG can induce durable responses, ~50% of
patients have recurrence or progression of their disease. No clear mechanism of action behind BCG’s anti-
neoplastic activity in NMIBC has been delineated. Studies have demonstrated that PD-L1 showed significant
increases following BCG administration, supporting the use of PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade in settings of BCG
resistance. These finding have led to Pembrolizumab monotherapy, a PD-1 inhibitor, becoming the first FDA
approved treatment for BCG refractory NMIBC in over 20 years. In KEYNOTE-057 (n = 101), 41% of BCG
resistant patients had complete response at 3 months, but only a 19% durable response at 12 months. As we
can see from KEYNOTE-057 inhibition of PD-1 has modest activity against BCG resistant tumors even though
the tumor has upregulation of PD-1. The failure of PD-1 blockade to yield a more complete response in BCG-
resistant patients suggests that our understanding of immune resistance mechanisms in NMIBC is incomplete.
The HLA-E/NKG2A axis is a novel immune checkpoint that has shown significant preclinical promise as a
target including in the setting of PD-1 resistance. This axis has been studied in several other tumor types.
Significant data has also accumulated identifying the ability of tumor cells to modulate the tumor
microenvironment leading to anti-tumor immunity. We have demonstrated that HLA-E BRIGHT tumors are highly
activated and produce chemokines, CXCL9/10/11, leading to recruitment of NK and CD8 T cells (including
regulatory T cells (Tregs)) within proximity of HLA-EBRIGHT tumor nests. This recruitment leads to immune
dysregulation allowing for continued tumor growth. Together this data describes a dynamic process of tumor
cell and immune cell interactions, which can be altered under certain pressures. Our central hypothesis is that
BCG resistance occurs in the setting of HLAE-EBRIGHT tumor cell causing recruitment and dysregulation of
immune cells allowing for HLA-EDIM cells to grow. We seek to capitalize on spatial transcriptomic sequencing
(STseq) and immue mass cytometry (IMC), novel technologies with the potential to revolutionize our
understanding of NMIBC at the tissue-architecture level."

10897977,"The risk of developing tuberculosis (TB) is estimated to be 26 to 31 times greater in people living with Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). The arduous treatment regimen for TB (minimum of six months on a cocktail
of antibiotics with dose-limiting side-effects) has remained essentially unchanged for decades. Reducing the
global TB burden has focused primarily on new antibiotics and vaccines with little focus on macrophage targeted
drug delivery methods that activate the immune system to increase microbial eradication. To address this unmet
need, we developed a targeted macrophage therapy with broad applications for HIV and TB. Our formulation
delivers a model rifamycin drug, rifampin, loaded into β-glucan and chitosan coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid
(GLU-CS-PLGA) nanoparticles. Our pharmacokinetic studies found that after a single nanoparticle
administration via oropharyngeal aspiration to healthy mice, rifampin was detected in the cellular fraction of the
bronchoalveolar lavage up to 10 days post-dosing. Furthermore, we found a time course of release of TNFα that
returns to baseline at 24 hr post administration. All nanoparticles stimulated the release of TNFα in the range
of 500 to 2000 pg/ml, similar to TNFα concentrations in a TB mouse model after drug treatment. While we have
demonstrated sustained delivery of rifampin to alveolar macrophage in mice using our nanoparticles, we have
yet to learn how this nanoparticle functions in the setting of virulent mycobacterium tuberculosis in the
lung. Furthermore, we have yet to discover how this nanoformulation affects a TB granuloma in the absence
or presence of HIV viral proteins. To address this, we are taking a two-pronged approach with independent
aims. Aim 1, “Determine the GLU-CS-PLGA nanoparticles in an in vitro TB granuloma model in the absence or
presence of HIV proteins”, will analyze the bactericidal efficacy elicited by GLU-CS-PLGA nanoparticles in this
model. We also have included an exploratory experiment to investigate the effects of HIV-1 proteins on
GLU-CS-PLGA nanoparticle efficacy. Aim 2, “Determine the in vivo efficacy of GLU-CS-PLGA nanoparticles in
the BALB/c TB mouse model”, will determine the bactericidal efficacy in situ in the lungs following
oropharyngeal aspiration with GLU-CS-PLGA in the BALB/c TB mouse model. Therefore, this nanoplatform is
broadly relevant to disorders that affect macrophage, including TB and HIV (HIV macrophage reservoirs).
Determining the efficacious nature of this nanoformulation is essential to decide whether (1) we should abandon
this therapeutic approach or (2) we should move forward to test it in an advanced mouse TB model that develops
highly organized encapsulated necrotic lesions, i.e., granulomas, that contain large numbers of extracellular
bacilli that more closely resembled human lesions and, in an HIV-TB co-infection model. This innovative
proposal advances the conceptual and mechanistic knowledge of stimulation of the immune system to treat
infectious diseases and this novel immune-stimulating drug delivery nanoparticle platform. By incorporating
GLU onto the nanoparticle's surface, the resulting immune stimulation is independent of its therapeutic cargo."

Liv Labs has developed a novel, reusable, self-administered silicone pessary for patient-controlled treatment of
female stress urinary incontinence (SUI), a bothersome condition that affects some 29 million American women
over the age of 25. Unlike the fitted and disposable pessaries available on the market today, this patent-
pending Soft Spring Continence Pessary is a symmetrical, hollow, resilient form placed intravaginally, above
the pelvic floor—not to kink the urethra, as other effective devices and surgical procedures do, but rather to
gently compress the urethra through soft, vaginal tissue. The device compresses down into a 10mm cylinder
for applicator-assisted insertion and features an integrated finger loop for easy manual removal. Comprising
only soft, rounded surfaces, the spring pessary can be lubricated for use by patients with vaginal atrophy who
sometimes experience pain, lacerations, or injury with existing devices. Liv Labs completed a pilot feasibility
study (n=9). Directional efficacy and safety were reported, as well as high user satisfaction. Phase II outcomes
included a summative human factors study (Aim 1), FDA Pre-Submission Review, clinical release of device
and package design, samples fabrication, a nonclinical testing plan and IRB approval of a pivotal clinical trial
plan that responds to FDA feedback. A single-arm, open label, interventional efficacy study is now approved at
three sites under Northwestern University’s Integrated Pelvic Health Program (Phase IIB Aim 1). The study will
enroll at least 57 symptomatic women diagnosed with SUI and confirming device fit. Study candidates will
perform a validated one-hour pad weight test without intervention; if enrolled, they will perform the same test
again with intervention. During the at-home study phase, study participants will track leak frequency and side
effects, with and without intervention. Quality of life will be measured through validated questionnaires. Those
participants who complete the study will be invited to enroll in a subsequent prospective, descriptive study of
patient-managed device use for a period of six months (Phase IIB Aim 2). Nonclinical testing will address both
intended device use and potential misuse. The core team at Liv Labs comprises late-career product
developers with experience inventing medical devices and software, branded consumer products and services,
and technology-enabled, proactive care models for aging in place. The extended team includes top-tier
consultants in engineering, manufacturing, quality systems, clinical research and regulatory strategy. Once
commercialized, the first-ever Soft Spring Continence Pessary will provide millions of women, from all walks of
life, a practical, affordable way to self-treat their SUI symptoms and increase their inclination toward fitness."

Mannose metabolism as a regulator of hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis
This proposal addresses the critical unmet need for effective anti-fibrotic therapies by elucidating an
unexplored pathway regulating activation of the hepatic stellate cell (HSC), a resident perisinusoidal cell type
that stores vitamin A in normal liver. However, among potential mechanisms driving HSC plasticity, sugar
metabolism pathways have been largely overlooked. The role of mannose metabolism in HSC biology has not
yet been examined, but recent high-impact studies, including ours (Shtraizent and DeRossi et al., eLife 2017),
implicate mannose as a mediator of obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) is the
key enzyme involved in catabolism of mannose; MPI mutation in humans leads to a congenital disorder of N-
glycosylation characterized by early and progressive liver fibrosis in children. Our data and these clinical
observations stimulated us to explore how the loss of MPI in this pediatric disorder leads to liver fibrosis. Our
exciting data find that: 1) MPI is decreased during HSC activation and fibrosis in rodents and zebrafish in vivo,
2) decreased MPI correlates with advanced stages of liver fibrosis in human HBV and NAFLD cohorts, and 3)
MPI depletion promotes HSC activation in human HSCs. Remarkably, mannose supplementation attenuates
HSC activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our objective is to understand the regulatory role of mannose
metabolism in HSCs and liver fibrosis. With the following aims, we will test our central hypotheses that
mannose metabolism is a critical metabolic pathway mediating HSC activation and attenuation.
Disruption of mannose metabolism, through loss of MPI, leads to HSC activation; conversely,
exogeneous mannose supplementation can attenuate HSC activation and liver fibrosis in vivo. Specific
Aims: Aim 1. Determine how MPI loss activates HSCs: By using primary rat HSCs and in vivo genetic
zebrafish models, we will investigate the role of O-GlcNAcylation in HSC activation, determine the cell-specific
effects of MPI-depletion, and test whether enhancing MPI activity can attenuate fibrogenesis following
exposure to well-established HSC activators. Aim 2. Determine the efficacy of mannose supplementation in
attenuating HSC activation in vitro and in vivo. This aim will use in vivo rodent models of fibrosis to investigate
how mannose supplementation modulates the plasticity of HSC phenotypes and test the extent of mannose to
attenuate liver fibrosis in vivo. Our long-term goal is to better understand the metabolic drivers of HSC
activation to manipulate these fuel-generating mechanisms and attenuate liver fibrosis. We will leverage our
expertise in the biology of a rare liver disease to advance our understanding of the metabolic regulation of HSC
activation, and to establish how this overlooked pathway of mannose metabolism can regulate HSC plasticity.
These studies are the first to investigate the antifibrotic roles of mannose supplementation and may reveal a
novel target and accessible therapeutic approach to suppress liver fibrosis."

 Candida species are the primary cause of systemic fungal infections in nosocomial environments.
Several of these species are common components of the human intestinal microbiota where they have been
increasingly linked with mucosal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Candida cells in the gut
are also a critical reservoir for systemic infections as they can translocate out of this niche and disseminate
throughout the body, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. There is therefore a pressing need to
understand how Candida colonizes the GI tract and to define how changes to the commensal environment
impact colonization behavior and the immune response.
 This project addresses the attributes of Candida cells that enables them to colonize the mammalian
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Despite the importance of Candida to both gut mucosal and systemic disease, a
substantial knowledge gap exists in defining the molecular mechanisms that support colonization of the GI
tract. In the case of Candida albicans (Ca), the most prevalent cause of fungal systemic disease, previous
studies have indicated that yeast cells are optimal for gut colonization, whereas cells in the hyphal (filamentous)
state are detrimental to commensalism but critical for systemic virulence. These studies are based on antibiotic-
supplemented hosts, however, and our pilot experiments reveal the hyphal state plays an essential role in
colonization of hosts that harbor an antibiotic-naïve microbiome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
candidalysin, a toxin secreted by hyphal Ca cells, is critical for colonization of the GI tract when bacteria are
present, indicating that this factor supports competition with the bacterial microbiota.
 To build on these observations, we will examine how Candida morphology and co-regulated genes
enable host colonization, while focusing on both Ca and the related species Candida parapsilosis (Cp). The
Aims of this Project are (1) To define the effects of Candida morphology on fungal metabolism and intestinal
fitness, (2) To determine the role of candidalysin in intestinal colonization, and (3) To use quantitative trait loci
(QTL) mapping to identify traits impacting Candida commensalism. We emphasize that these experiments will
use a wide variety of murine GI models that harbor either native bacterial populations or engineered microbial
populations to determine how interkingdom interactions influence fungal gut commensalism.
 Together, these experiments will build on exciting preliminary experiments that overturn the prevailing
paradigm that yeast-locked Candida cells are optimal for colonization, and that the hyphal-specific toxin
candidalysin is a key gut colonization factor in addition to an established virulence factor. Given the importance
of gut colonization to fungal-host interactions and systemic disease, these experiments will provide critical new
insights into understanding how Candida species operate as human pathobionts."

We have developed a 3D bioengineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived model of IPF that
displays progressive fibrosis and closely phenocopies several characteristics associated with IPF. This model is
an extension of our 2D model of progressive fibrosis (Vijayaraj et al., Cell Reports – in press). To make our
progressive fibrosis model specific to IPF, we have developed it into a model system that utilizes the lung 3D
architecture and specific cell types. Our 3D model displays additional features of IPF such as airway epithelial
cell (AEC) apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and replacement of alveolar architecture.
Our proposal aims to improve and validate this 3D model such that it will be amenable to a high throughput drug
discovery platform in a patient specific manner for precision medicine. Our project aims to use our unique
stem/progenitor cell models of IPF to increase our understanding of the disease and for drug discovery.
Specific Aim 1. To improve and validate the 3D bioengineered human iPSC derived model of IPF
A. To validate the 3D model of IPF by performing extensive characterization of the model compared to human
 IPF lung tissue.

C. To characterize the 3D IPF model by known genetic risk factors.
Specific Aim 2 – To use our 3D bioengineered iPSC-derived model to study cellular plasticity in IPF
To profile cellular plasticity of AECs in our 3D model of IPF and compare it to human IPF tissue using single cell

10763365,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hyperexcitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is associated with impaired learning in early stages of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Causal upstream signaling mechanisms occurring within DG circuits early in AD
pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging proposes that
mitochondria, through the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), cause oxidative damage to
proteins, lipids, and DNA ¾ a process termed oxidative stress (OS). Antioxidants (AOs) normally counteract
this process by scavenging excess ROS, thereby preventing OS. The antioxidant all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA), the active form of retinol, has a dual role in ROS scavenging and transcriptional control of
synaptic/neuronal proteins via its function as a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist. Recent evidence from
rodents has demonstrated an age-dependent decline in hippocampal ATRA levels due to homeostatic collapse
of the liver-brain axis. We propose that ATRA depletion in the DG is an early event in AD pathogenesis,
leading to excess ROS-induced damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced occupancy of RARs across
DG cell types, accelerating amyloidosis, network hyperexcitability, and cognitive dysfunction. Bolstering this
scientific premise, secondary analyses of human hippocampal transcriptomic data led us to discover a large
number of OS- and RAR-sensitive genes dysregulated in AD brains. In preliminary studies from the J20 AD
mouse model, chronic treatment with ATRA normalized behavior, prevented the formation of aberrant inhibitory
circuits in the DG, and normalized a number of pathways that included RAR- and OS-sensitive genes in the
DG. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that ATRA depletion induces oxidative stress and loss of
transcriptional control of RAR-sensitive genes in DG cell types, which can be accelerated or delayed
by bidirectionally manipulating DG ATRA levels. Using an innovative multidisciplinary approach that
uniquely combines DG-dependent learning paradigms, single cell transcriptomics, and cellular/synaptic
analysis in two AD mouse models, we will determine how bidirectional manipulation of ATRA levels alters
transcriptional control of RAR-sensitive genes across DG cell types and impacts DG-dependent learning and
cellular/synaptic function. SA1 tests the hypothesis that impaired DG-specific reversal learning is accompanied
by impaired transcription of RAR-sensitive genes in DG cell types, increased OS, and mitochondrial
dysfunction in two AD mouse models. SA2 tests the hypothesis that reversal learning performance, OS levels,
and RAR-sensitive gene expression in DG cell types depend on dietary retinol intake in two AD mouse models.
Finally, SA3 tests the hypothesis that DG circuit function depends on dietary retinol intake in two AD mouse
models. Successful completion of this project will reveal novel mechanisms of DG-related learning impairments
in AD and discover new AD biomarkers in specific cell types indicative of ATRA deficiency. Determining roles
of retinol in protection against AD will enable rapid dissemination of knowledge from bench to bedside."

Candidate: Dr. Karen du Preez has dedicated herself to a research career focused on improving health care for
children in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Her overall career development goal is to become an
independent clinician scientist with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary skill set and research network to efficiently
answer high priority public health questions, and have the ability to translate research findings into meaningful
policy and implementation changes to improve health care for children in South Africa, and globally. This overall
goal is supported by three specific training aims: 1) To understand and apply specialized analytical skills to public
health research, specifically disease estimation modelling techniques and spatial analytic methods; 2) To
strengthen clinical, management and leadership expertise; and 3) To develop the ability to translate research
into meaningful policy changes and implementation. Dr. du Preez has the full support of the Desmond Tutu TB
Centre, an internationally recognized research center at Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa and
has assembled a mentoring team highly experienced in all facets of pediatric TB research, and actively involved
at both national and international level contributing to scientific steering committees and supporting pediatric TB
program implementation.
Research: The lack of reliable surveillance data for the disease burden and spectrum of pediatric tuberculosis
(TB) is a challenge that limits our ability to appropriately manage the disease globally. TB meningitis (TBM) is a
severe form of pediatric tuberculosis with very poor outcomes and often consequent lifelong neurological
disability if not diagnosed and treated early. Very little childhood TBM surveillance data exist and the overall
goal of this research is therefore to determine the burden, incidence and outcomes of childhood TBM at three
levels: global, national (South Africa) and sub-national (Cape Town district), whilst identifying opportunities for
prevention, earlier diagnosis and treatment. Mathematical modelling techniques will be used to estimate the
global burden of childhood TBM disease and attributable mortality, by country and WHO region (Specific Aim 1).
Routine TB surveillance data from South Africa, spanning 14 years (2004-2017), will be used to determine the
spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the national disease burden and treatment outcomes of childhood TBM and
identify population-level drivers of high burden locations and unfavorable outcomes (Specific Aim 2).
Prospective, complementary surveillance strategies will identify all diagnosed and undiagnosed childhood TBM
cases (<15 years) within the Cape Town health district over a 2-year period. All identified children will be eligible
for enrolment in an observational cohort study that will collect data on diagnostic certainty, disease severity,
comorbidities, outcomes and missed opportunities for both TB preventive therapy and earlier diagnosis, with the
aim of informing earlier diagnosis (diagnostic algorithms) and targeted interventions for improved TBM
prevention and care (Specific Aim 3)."
10763420,"Due to the high prevalence of risk factors such as smoking and human papillomavirus infection, head and
neck cancers are a particular threat to individuals in low-income, underserved communities. Because of limited
access to screening tools for early cancer detection to reduce mortality and morbidity, they have diminishing
chances of long-term survival. Cancer mortality and morbidity in these areas will not see a reduction without the
development of practical and easily accessible diagnostic methods and instrumentation.
 To address these limitations, we propose to develop and validate a nanophotonics-enhanced molecular assay
based on ultrabright surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) “nanorattle” probes for multiplexed detection
of biomarkers of squamous cell carcinoma; this cancer accounts for about 85% of all head and neck cancers.
For analytical validation, our assay method will be tested on clinical samples, such as fresh tissue and brush
cytology biopsies. Brush cytology is a form of non-invasive biopsy performed without the need of surgical or
specialized care. By combining “lab-on-a-stick” technology with ultrabright SERS nanorattles, the assay concept
provides a unique rapid ‘sample-to-answer’ approach. Our molecular analysis technology is designed to be
integrated in a portable device, referred to as Raman Assay using Plasmonics for Identification and Diagnosis
(RAPID). We envision the RAPID technology to be deployed as a low-cost diagnostic tool capable of point-of-
care head and neck cancer identification, with the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease
in underserved populations due to early detection of cancer.
 The project’s aims are the following: (1) Develop nanoplasmonic-based nanorattle probes for multiplex
detection of head and neck cancer molecular biomarkers; (2) Integrate the molecular analysis method into a
simple-to-use, automated and portable point-of-care device; (3) Evaluate and validate the molecular analysis
method for diagnosis in tissue samples and brush cytology biopsies; and (4) Deploy the technology for
implementation at the point-of-care in an underserved community setting.
 The implications of the RAPID method are vast and significant for cancer research as well as diagnostics,
especially in the setting of underserved populations. For patients presenting with a suspicious head and neck
lesion, our method can provide a rapid diagnosis, allowing for earlier treatment before the onset of distant
metastases. This novel technology will also allow direct mRNA biomarker detection for research on cancer
development and progression. Compared to laboratory-based histopathologic diagnosis, requiring specialized
equipment and trained operators for qRT-PCR and often taking weeks or even months in remote regions, the
RAPID method can be completed in less than an hour at the point of need. Ultimately, the integration of this
molecular method into a portable device will allow for clinical translation to render a faster and more accurate
diagnosis at point-of-care settings and for global health applications."
10763848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have achieved remarkable progress over the last decade, including the direct
control of sophisticated anthropomorphic robotic arms and the incorporation of tactile feedback. However, the
dexterity of current brain-controlled prosthetic limbs is limited in two important ways. First, most neuroprosthetic
control involves decoding kinematics from the responses of neurons in primary motor cortex (M1). While this
approach has been successful for controlling the proximal arm (shoulder and elbow) to place and orient the
hand, it is fundamentally inadequate for hand control and interactions with objects, which requires not only
orienting the wrist and shaping the digits but also applying appropriate forces. This problem is complicated by
the fact that force and kinematic signals as well as hand and arm signals are all intermingled in the neural
population activity in M1. Furthermore, hand and arm representations of force and kinematics seem to depend
on the task, as evidenced by the fact that decoders developed for one task fail to generalize to another. Second,
tactile feedback is critical to manual behavior as evidenced by the severe deficits that result from deafferentation.
To achieve dexterous control of a prosthetic arm thus also requires restoration of tactile feedback. One promising
approach is intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of somatosensory cortex (S1), which evokes vivid tactile
percepts experienced on the (otherwise insensate) hand. There is a growing consensus that mimicking
naturalistic patterns of neuronal activation will lead to more natural tactile percepts and more dexterous hand
use. However, the neural basis of touch has been studied almost exclusively with stimuli passively presented to
the unmoving hand, which precludes any understanding of how motor behavior shapes S1 responses and
hinders the development of biomimetic encoding algorithms.
To fill these gaps, we will have NHPs perform prehensile behaviors in which we systematically vary hand and
arm kinematics and forces, and measure the time-varying postures of the entire limb and the forces exerted on
objects, including contact forces at each digit. We seek to characterize (1) signals in M1 relating to kinematics
and forces exerted by the arm and hand; (2) signals in S1 relating to active interactions with objects; and (3)
signals transferred between M1 and S1. We propose to apply well-established encoding and decoding
techniques to investigate the relationship between neural responses and movement parameters as well as a
novel dynamical systems analysis. The resulting insights into the neural mechanisms of prehension will lead to
(1) the development of decoders of intended limb state from M1 responses that include both kinematics and
force control and generalize across behavioral tasks; (2) biomimetic sensory encoding algorithms informed by
an understanding of active touch representations in S1. The research team is uniquely poised to test the resulting
decoders and sensory encoding algorithms in human BCI participants as part an ongoing clinical trial at both
sites through an ongoing NIH funded project."
10764118,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND RELEVANCE
The sphingolipid metabolites, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its precursors sphingosine and ceramides,
have emerged as pleiotropic signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular responses. Previously, we have
shown that in response to numerous stimuli, S1P produced intracellularly by two sphingosine kinases, SPHK1
and SPHK2, is exported out of cells via a specific transporter Spinster homolog 2 (SPNS2) to activate its
receptors S1PRs. While this process that we coined “inside-out signaling by S1P” is responsible for many of its
known functions, it has long been suspected that SPHK and the sphingolipids it regulates, S1P, sphingosine,
and ceramide, also have intracellular functions. This is an important gap that our research and the MIRA
proposal are aimed at filling as lower organisms express the evolutionary conserved sphingolipid metabolic
enzymes and although sphingolipid metabolites regulate important biological functions in these organisms,
they do not have S1PRs. Moreover, these enzymes are present in distinct subcellular compartments,
suggesting that the location(s) where sphingolipid metabolites are produced dictates their functions. The MIRA
proposal is focused on the roles of these sphingolipid metabolites in governing membrane contact sites (MCS)
between the ER network and late endocytic organelles versus the plasma membrane to control the movement
of cholesterol and sphingolipids between distinct cell membranes and their metabolism. Our research will also
address the involvement of these sphingolipid metabolites in establishment of lysosome-mitochondria MCS
and consequence to mitochondrial function and bioenergetics and define how they regulate localization of
GRAMD1s family, evolutionarily conserved ER-anchored cholesterol transfer proteins. Another goal of the
proposed research is to understand the functional transport mechanism of SPNS2, which remains
controversial, and could have important ramifications as SPNS2 has been linked to metabolism, cancer
metastasis, and auditory, inflammatory, and immune disorders.
 The new conceptual groundwork in this proposal will alter our understanding of sphingolipid metabolites
signaling and will reveal their ancient but understudied intracellular roles in regulation of membrane dynamics
and contact sites as sensors that integrate and coordinate sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism, and
potentially glucose homeostasis. Although this area of research is just in its infancy, we believe that our
proposed studies will shed new light on enigmatic functions of bioactive sphingolipids appropriate to their name
associated with the riddle of the Sphinx. It should also provide deeper understanding of how perturbations of
these fundamental biological processes contribute to human diseases."
10765638,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The capacity of the olfactory epithelium (OE) for replenishing the population of olfactory sensory neurons and
for regenerating the epithelium after injury depends on the persistence and maintained function of stem cells
within that adult tissue. Decline in sensory function in the elderly is accompanied by pathological changes in
the OE that emerge because the normally active olfactory stem and progenitor cells, namely globose basal
cells (GBCs), become disordered and eventually depleted. In this setting, the reserve stem cells, namely the
horizontal basal cells (HBCs), remain dormant despite the neurogenic exhaustion and disappearance of GBCs;
in contrast, if the OE is damaged by an olfactotoxin, the HBCs activate and contribute to the repair of the
epithelium. A therapeutic strategy that accomplishes controllable activation of HBCs in the setting of an
exhausted OE offers possibly the best approach to treating age-related olfactory dysfunction. We have
demonstrated that the transcription factor p63 is the master switch that regulates HBC activation – a
precipitous decline in p63 levels is necessary and sufficient for activation. Further, signaling by Notch1
maintains p63 levels and restrains activation; we hypothesize that the ligand for Notch1 is Jagged1 expressed
by sustentacular cells, since their selective death is sufficient to activate HBCs. We propose 2 Aims in this
application to build on previous advances. Aim 1 focuses on Notch signaling and asks how precisely do the
complexities of the Notch pathway in the OE regulate HBCs? Additional questions address the other signals
that derive from Sus cells to regulate HBCs. Finally, we will extend our studies manipulating Notch signaling
in tissue culture to human HBCs. Aim 2 focuses on the activation process following injury and asks how does
proteasomal degradation of p63 contribute to the decline in protein levels in mouse and in human HBCs?
When completed, we will have achieved a much more thorough understanding of the process by which HBCs
are shifted out of dormancy so that they might contribute to epithelial regeneration. That understanding of
mechanism in both mouse, where genetic manipulations offer profound analytic power, and in humans will
advance our efforts aimed at identifying therapeutic strategies for alleviating olfactory sensory dysfunction,
particularly the sensory loss which accompanies aging."
10766198,"ABSTRACT
Allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and allergic asthma represent a global health problem
that disproportionately impacts children. Surprisingly, there are no approved approaches to prevent the
development of these diseases in at-risk individuals, resulting in chronic morbidity and economic burden. The
management of asthma, for example, carries a steep cost burden of billions of dollars per year in the US alone,
of which nearly 20 billion is spent on standard of care treatments with variable efficacy. Food allergy management
is generally limited to allergen avoidance and rescue from severe acute anaphylaxis. There is a crucial need to
develop innovative strategies to prevent the onset of these Type 1 allergic diseases rather than treating their
symptoms. A preventative approach targeting at-risk individuals could significantly reduce the morbidity and
healthcare burden associated with these increasingly common conditions.
Studies confirm the link between gut microbiota development, immunological training, and allergic disease onset
in childhood, and it is now clear that allergic disease risk is associated with aberrant microbial exposures over
the first year of life. Longitudinal gut microbiota profiling studies in infants and children show that a loss of specific
immunomodulatory commensal bacteria, and their metabolic networks, precedes allergic disease development.
Using infant gut microbiota data sets and in vivo allergic disease models, Siolta Therapeutics has designed a
live biotherapeutic product (LBP), STMC-103H, to stimulate tolerant immunological development and prevent
allergic disease onset in at-risk individuals. STMC-103H contains three distinct active ingredient bacteria isolated
from healthy human stool. Siolta has performed extensive cGMP manufacturing development, including
formulation, process, and analytical method development, to support Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of
STMC-103H under an IND with the FDA.
In this project, we will build on our previous STMC-103H drug product development to improve the stability,
potency, and characterization approaches for late-stage clinical trials and subsequent commercialization.
Success of this project will directly support the regulatory and commercial development of STMC-103H.
Indirectly, this work will improve the manufacturing and clinical development of diverse candidate LBPs
containing sensitive live bacteria with high therapeutic potential. Siolta will also seek to license novel
manufacturing approaches to other LBP developers."
10766199,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The signals of rods and cones set the fundamental limits of visual discrimination, which ultimately determine
our ability to detect objects in the world around us. Normal photoreceptor function is essential for vision;
degeneration of rods and cones produces blindness. Although research during the last 40 years has clarified
many features of photoreceptor function and dysfunction, most of this work has been done on rods, even
though cones respond over a much wider range of intensities and are more important in visual perception,
particularly for the ability of the visual system to detect change and motion. The principal aim of this proposal
is to exploit an important technical advance which, for the first time, has made possible the routine recording
of both voltage and current light responses from intact mouse cones. Although cones in other mammalian
species including primates have been investigated, mouse has the particular advantage that mutant strains are
available. These strains make possible (1) more accurate voltage clamping of photoreceptors by removal of
photoreceptor gap junctions, (2) deletion of particular conductance mechanisms to test their effects on signal
modulation and degeneration, and (3) physiological recording from degenerating cones in strains particularly
amenable to analysis. With these techniques, we are proposing to learn how cone inner-segment conductances
modulate outer-segment currents to generate voltage responses and increase temporal discrimination.
Recordings will be made from Cx36-/- mutant mice lacking connexin-36 gap junctions, and from Cx36-/- mice
also lacking one of the inner-segment conductances, in order to explain how these conductances interact with
outer-segment currents to produce the waveform of voltage responses. We will use a combination of white
noise and chirp stimuli to investigate the temporal characteristics of cone responses, in order to assess the
importance of inner-segment conductances to the frequency response of the cone. We will use mathematical
modeling to explain the effects of each of the inner-segment conductances on the waveform of the voltage
response and on temporal sensitivity. Our ultimate goal is to understand how inner-segment conductances
shape the voltage response and determine the sensitivity of cones to changing illumination. We will use these
same techniques to investigate how cone function is altered during degeneration. We are proposing to record
from cones at several stages during degeneration in both rd10 and Cngb1-/- mice, whose cones degenerate at
different rates. In this way, we hope to study cone single-cell physiology as they begin losing their outer
segments, and then later from single ""dormant"" cell bodies after outer segments are lost. We will also
investigate the effect of deletion of inner-segment conductances on the rate of cone degeneration, and the effect
of these deletions on the physiology of the degenerating cells."

Organic Photoredox Catalysts for Synthetic Method Development
Garret M. Miyake, Colorado State University, Department of Chemistry
Catalysis is arguably the most important chemical contribution to society as it enables the
synthesis of medicines and materials that are critical to enhancing human lives. To
address current and future health needs, the development of catalyst systems that
accelerate the discovery and manufacturing of medicines through new and more efficient
chemical reactions are necessary. However, many classic catalytic methodologies
employ precious metals, hazardous reagents, or forcing conditions. By contrast,
photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful approach to access unique reaction
pathways and drive chemical reactions using light. Advantages of photoredox catalysis
include the ability to perform reactions under mild conditions, obviation of hazardous and
non-selective reagents, achievement of new selectivity, increased functional group
tolerance, increased reaction efficiencies, and access to unprecedented reaction
intermediates and manifolds. Much of the work in photoredox catalysis has applied well-
studied precious metal complexes or organic dyes that possess oxidizing excited states
as the catalysts. As such, to address metal contamination, sustainability, and the need
for expanded and novel reactivity, new organic photoredox catalysts with diverse
photophysical and electrochemical properties must be developed. The long-term goal of
the proposed research activities is to develop organic photoredox catalyst systems that
enable novel and improved syntheses of small molecules and materials that address
human health needs. This proposal describes the development of organic photoredox
catalyst systems with unprecedented redox potentials that enable new chemical
reactivity. We will employ a combination of experimental and computational approaches
to gain a fundamental understanding into the catalysts and reaction mechanisms.
Through mechanistically guided catalyst design, we seek to engineer systems that can
access the extremely reducing or oxidizing chemical potentials necessary to enable
challenging reactivity. Ultimately, this research will contribute to human health through
the development of catalysts with unique reactivity to enable new and improved
syntheses of medicines and medically important materials."

The New York State Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (NYSCBDRP) proposes to continue its
strong record of conducting epidemiologic research to identify the causes of birth defects through its
participation in the Birth Defects Study to Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS). The NYSCBDRP has
been a major contributor to CDC’s collaborative National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) and BD-
STEPS since 1996. The NYSCBDRP is situated in the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Birth
Defects Registry and enjoys a strong collaborative relationship with the University at Albany School of Public
Health. The Specific Aims of this project are to: (1) identify birth defect cases and controls from two
geographically and sociodemographically diverse catchment areas in New York State; (2) conduct
epidemiologic investigations on non-genetic risk factors for specific birth defects, including medications,
chronic and infectious disease, occupational factors, social determinants of health, and health equity, resulting
in at least 7 publications and 7 presentations over 3.5 years; (3) contribute residual newborn bloodspots and
investigate genetic factors for birth defects; (4) link individuals to the NYS National Electronic Disease
Surveillance System to ascertain and characterize the impact of infections before and during pregnancy on
birth defects; (5) evaluate and develop existing and novel modes of information collection for BD-STEPS; and
(6) mentor and train future birth defects researchers by offering internships and thesis/dissertation data for
graduate students at the University at Albany School of Public Health and training opportunities for junior
NYSCBDRP analysts. From its position within the NYSDOH, the NYSCBDRP will leverage considerable
resources through donated staff time, privileged access to individual medical records, the Birth Defects
Registry, infectious disease surveillance systems, and affiliation with the world-renowned Wadsworth Center
laboratory for genetic studies. The NYSCBDRP has demonstrated success implementing the NBDPS and BD-
STEPS studies and conducting birth defects research, with the highest BD-STEPS participation rate and more
than 50 peer-reviewed publications of NBDPS/BD-STEPS analyses led by an NYS author. The NYSCBDRP is
well-positioned to continue successfully implementing BD-STEPS, helping to increase knowledge of risk
factors for birth defects and inform prevention strategies."
10767116,"Military personnel deployed to Southeast Asia (SA) report increased respiratory symptoms. Unique to
SA deployment is a history of exposure to high levels of airborne particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter
(PM2.5) consisting of seasonal dust storms, burn-pit smoke, and unregulated industrial and vehicular pollutants.
Objective findings among returning Veterans are limited, therefore, the VA Cooperative Study #595 Service
and Health Among Deployed Veterans (SHADE) was funded to assess satellite confirmed exposure history
during land-based deployments to SA, in nearly 5000 at risk Veterans in six centers. The overall aim of
SHADE (Parent Project) is to associate PM2.5 exposure with spirometrically assessed pulmonary function, and
asthma history. Because SHADE offers a unique opportunity to identify early deployment-related lung findings
related to PM exposure, we propose to use this cohort to identify biophysical and clinical impact of PM
exposure through three inter-related Aims. To accomplish our goals we will recruit 280 SHADE participants
with (50%) and without (50%) respiratory symptoms (chronic cough, wheeze, or dyspnea) who are non- or
former-smokers with <10 pack year history of smoking from four participating SHADE sites (Minneapolis,
Houston, Boston and Seattle). This study will provide evidence for the systemic effects of exposure with
linkage to respiratory symptoms and reduced pulmonary function.
 This proposal is one of three coordinated projects to systematically examine pulmonary and systemic
effects of exposure during deployment. Specifically, this project will use state-of-the-art technology and
expertise (biomarker discovery, multi-omic analysis, immunology and bioinformatics) to provide a
comprehensive assessment of systemic inflammatory and airway related biomarkers in deployment-related
PM2.5 exposure. Further, our proposed approach using systemic and immune based biomarkers contributes to
the overall rationale for our Collaborative Merit Applications. We will test the hypothesis that increased
systemic biomarkers of airway and pulmonary injury and/or immune cell activation status will
distinguish previously deployed veterans with and without respiratory symptoms and associate with
greater deployment related PM2.5 exposures. Specifically, we will examine the association between systemic
biomarkers of airway injury with activation of the innate and acquired immune system to respiratory symptoms,
lung function parameters, and PM2.5 exposures.
 In this collaborative proposal all four sites will study the same 280 patients that in addition to biomarker
studies will have lung structure evaluation by quantitative CT imaging (Boston VA project) and additional
physiologic characterization using diffusion capacity and exhaled nitric oxide to evaluate eosinophilic airway
inflammation (Seattle VA project). Using well-designed biostatistical approaches, we will test our hypothesis
that greater exposure to PM2.5 results in specific airway and lung parenchymal endotypes that could be
distinguished by functional, structural, and biochemical mechanisms. Our three coordinated proposals will
complement CSP #595 by comprehensively characterizing early deployment-related lung findings related to
PM2.5 exposure that may in the future be used to assess disease. The resultant exposure-related disease types
identified provide new clinical applications for the recognition, management, and future treatment strategies for
Veterans with deployment-related lung disease."

HIV/AIDS has spread relentlessly since it was first identified in 1983, causing one of the most devastating
pandemics in human history. Historical accounts of infectious diseases show that they can have a major
impact on U.S. Armed Forces. With 34 million individuals infected worldwide, HIV-1 poses a significant and
persistent threat to force readiness and the stability of many nation-states. The incidence of HIV/AIDS infection
among U.S. service personnel is significant and the risk of exposure to HIV-1 by heterosexual intercourse
among veterans and service personnel is much greater. Heterosexual HIV-1 transmission from men to women
accounts for the majority of new infections worldwide, and notably, women are entering into military service at
an increasing rate. The discovery of effective prevention modalities for women is hindered by a lack of basic
information about early virus-host interactions in the female genital tract mucosa that underlie the acquisition of
HIV-1 infection. Non-human primate (NHP) models of HIV/SIV transmission indicate that macrophages and
predominantly CD4 T cells become infected within the first few days after high-dose intravaginal challenge.
The observation of early CD4 T cell infection seemed consistent with subsequent published work indicating
transmitted/founder (TF) viruses generally exhibit low to moderate tropism for monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDM). However, recent published and unpublished data (Preliminary Studies) would argue that this central
question regarding HIV-1 transmission biology, and the role of macrophages in particular, warrants additional
investigation. Our central hypothesis is that cervical macrophages are required to drive HIV-1 replication and
spread in the cervical mucosa. Our corollary hypothesis, though beyond the immediate scope of this
application, is that cervical macrophages (cMφs) are required for expansion and spread of HIV-1 infection
beyond initial foci of infected CD4 T cell in the mucosa, and thus represent an underlying determinant of
mucosal HIV-1 heterosexual transmission in women. To interrogate this central hypothesis, we propose the
following specific aims: (1) To characterize the dynamics of HIV-1 infection and replication in human cervical
explant tissue; (2) To determine the spatiotemporal relationships between uninfected and HIV-1 infected cMφs
and CD4 T lymphocytes in cervical tissue in situ; and (3) To identify cellular determinants of cMφs
susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Our research promise to elucidate critical virus-host interactions that underlie
the establishment of HIV-1 infection in the female mucosal genital tract. Validation of our central hypothesis
would impart a paradigm shift in the field, and implicate cMφs as a viable early target for the discovery of new
HIV/AIDS prevention strategies."
10767118,"Thanks to the collaborative efforts of immunologists and oncologists, cancer immunotherapy
and its immunologic research made clinical and scientific breakthrough in treatment of lung
cancer. Here, we assembled an outstanding team of researchers including immunologist,
clinical oncologists, and cancer biologist to investigate the role of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells
such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), and seek a new approach for myeloid cell-
mediated cancer immunotherapy. Microenvironmental milieu determines the phenotype of
myeloid cells. Our lab reported that Colony Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1), one of key mediators of
microenvironment, is critical for determining the immunologic function of a DC subset. It has
been well known that tumor cells secrete CSF1 to alter their microenvironment and yet, the
mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. Several agents targeting CSF1 receptor (CSF1R)
are being tested for cancer treatment in ongoing clinical trials. We propose a new role of tumor-
produced CSF1 in altering tumor immune microenvironment toward tumor progression by
producing autotaxin (ATX) which increases the number of protumoral myeloid cells such as
macrophages and DCs. ATX, also known as lysophospholipase D, is secreted extracellularly
and enzymatically generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) which is the most abundant
phospholipid in body fluid. LPA is well known to stimulate cellular proliferation, migration and
survival for myeloid lineage cells.
 The proposal is based on the PI’s two new critical discoveries on myeloid cell biology; (1) ATX
is highly expressed in myeloid cells under the control of CSF1 and its receptor (CSF1R)
activation, (2) ATX regulates the size of the residential population of lung myeloid cells in the
CSF1R-dependent manner (CSF1R-ATX pathway). Together these findings have led to the
hypothesis that tumor-produced CSF1 stimulates protumoral myeloid cells to secrete ATX in
order to increase the number of protumoral macrophages and DCs. To validate the hypothesis,
we propose three specific aims. The basic science arm will employ the approaches for proof-of-
concept by utilizing the novel transgenic mice that have the loss or excess of the target genes.
The clinical arm will exploit clinical samples from patients with lung cancer to verify the proof-of-
concept. Lastly, in the translational arm, we will examine the therapeutic potentials of interfering
CSF1R-ATX pathway in the mouse model of lung cancer by adopting state-of-art nano-delivery
system.
By using novel transgenic mice specific to CSF1R-ATX pathway, the clinical materials from
patients and innovative approaches, we will interrogate the CSF1R-ATX pathway in tumor-
infiltrating myeloid cells, which play a key role in tumor cell biology and could lead to the
development of a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer."

In our prior Miner Safety and Health Training Programs - Western United States (U60) grants, we developed the
Learning Laboratories (LLs) program, which is an industry-academic collaboration involving three universities
and more than 20 mining organizations and operators representing over 20,000 mine workers in the Western
US. The LLs program provides needs-specific training resources and mentorship for miners, trainers,
supervisors, and health and safety (H&S) professionals across all sectors of the industry. Operators participating
in the LLs program have shown measurable improvements in H&S outcomes, including reductions in both
average injuries and days lost, up to 23.6% and 72.5%, respectively. Building upon these successes, we will
expand our LLs program through three specific aims: 1) Provide new pathways for training and research through
collaborative learning laboratories. Our LLs program offers a powerful mechanism for collaboration between
researchers, safety professionals, and industry trainers. The program will be expanded to meet all core elements
of NIOSH’s Research to Practice (R2P) initiative. Specifically, we will increase partnerships with trainers serving
contractors, small operators, and other underserved groups and MSHA State Grants programs. We will work
with investigators in academia and at NIOSH to identify industry needs, deploy new and existing training
materials, facilitate synergistic research agendas, and evaluate outcomes. We will enhance technology transfer
by streamlining deployment of new computer and app-based materials to industry partners for use in training
and continued development. We will improve communication among LL partners through meetings, workshops,
and an online forum. We will facilitate evaluation through mentorship and a cloud-based data collection and
analysis platform. 2) Improve health training. By adding new health modules to our training materials, many
NIOSH National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross-sector topic areas will be addressed, including
chronic disease, musculoskeletal health, hearing loss prevention, respiratory health, and heat strain. We will also
incorporate Total Worker Health topics such as mental health, substance abuse, and fatigue. 3) Develop, extend,
and integrate a continuum of training resources. Successful training products developed by our program, NIOSH,
and LL partners will be upgraded to incorporate new content, capabilities, and interoperability. We will develop
resources addressing all levels of trainer capability, from easily integrated tabletop games to computer-based
synthetic learning environments (SLEs). We will improve the accessibility of training and evaluation technologies,
particularly for trainers serving smaller operators and at worksites lacking sophisticated computer hardware,
using app-based mobile games and streaming services. Intermediate outcomes will include: 1) Improved H&S
practices; 2) Workers empowered through active learning; 3) Increased sharing of effective training programs;
and 4) An increased number of competent miners, trainers, supervisors and H&S personnel. The end outcomes
of the program will include H&S culture change and reductions in mining injuries, illnesses, and fatalities."

Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has significant effects on the physiology of the bacterial cells.
While much has been uncovered about post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria, there are
still some key unknowns that are hindering our ability to understand how these processes work and differ
throughout the prokaryotic domain of life. In this project, our overall goal is to expand our understanding of the
diversity of these processes in gram-negative model organisms, firmicutes, and mycobacteria. Our propsosed
research program has two sub-projects. Project #1 is entitled: Epitranscriptomic regulation of gene expression
throughout the prokaryotic domain. In sub-project 1, we will expand our understanding of RNA modifications
within a wide range of bacterial species. RNA modifications include an isomerization or chemical additions to
canonical nucleotides within RNA. Generally found in tRNA molecules, RNA modifications are critical in
promoting translational fidelity by promoting ribosome mRNA decoding errors. There are several key knowledge
gaps driving our experimental approach. The regulatory role of RNA modifications, cis-acting signals that may
promoting regulatory targeting of RNA modifications, and the effect of GC content on the ability of codon usage
to drive targeting of genes by modified tRNAs. We will use a multi-omics approach to address these key
knowledge gaps using several bacterial model organisms: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
Clostridioides difficile, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Project #2 is entitled: Post-transcriptional gene regulation
via novel proteins and sRNAs in firmicutes. In sub-project 2, we will expand our understanding of the regulatory
role of novel proteins and sRNAs in the regulation of the RNome in firmicutes. Much our understanding of sRNA
in bacteria has come from extensive studies in model organisms. This has assisted in our understanding sRNA
regulation of bacterial physiology in general. However, recent studies have uncovered hundreds of species-
specific sRNA in S. aureus. The vast majority of these are uncharacterized. Since we lack a full picture of sRNA
regulons in S. aureus, our understanding of bacterial sRNA biology is incomplete. In addition, many model
organisms utilize the RNA chaperone Hfq as a sRNA co-factor in some cases to promote sRNA-mRNA-RNase
interactions. However, Hfq is dispensable for growth and sRNA function. It is unknown if there are other protein
factors that may act as specific-specific chaperones in S. aureus or other firmicutes. We will have preliminary
data to suggest that novel regulatory proteins may exist, in S. aureus and C. difficile, in the mRNA regulation
and may also modulate levels of sRNAs. We will execute RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing of this candidate
protein in S. aureus and C. difficile to identify its RNA-interactome. We have also identified predicted sRNA
interactions with several important proteins in S. aureus and execute experiments to test this interaction."

DESCRIPTION: Influenza viruses can exchange genome segments and generate new
viruses when they infect the same cell, a process called reassortment. These new viruses
can worsen seasonal flu epidemics or spark global pandemics. We recently found that
patterns of reassortment show strong strain-dependence, and do not necessarily track
similarity between coinfecting strains or their subtype (H1N1 or H3N2). The specific
factors underlying this strain dependence remain unclear. The role of protein
incompatibilities in restricting segment exchange was thought to be associated with
different subtypes. However, experimental tests of the role of subtype in promoting or
restricting reassortment remain very limited, and the specific protein incompatibilities
(antigenic versus polymerase complex) that are most important in shaping reassortment
remain unknown. Using our high-throughput tools, we propose to uncover the basis of
strain dependent reassortment potential. First, we will quantify reassortment patterns
within and between co-circulating human influenza strains of both subtypes and
measure differences in entry and coinfection. Second, we will use mutants to test the
effect of antigenic versus polymerase complex segments in driving reassortment
potential. Finally, we will examine whether post-reassortment mutations can
compensate fitness in strains arising from between-subtype reassortment and their
fitness in different host cell types. Collectively these aims will provide basic insight into
the factors affecting strain dependence in reassortment potential and provide actionable
data to refocus surveillance and pandemic preparedness efforts."

 Eukaryotic cells solve the end-replication and end-protection problems through the addition
of telomere sequences to the ends of chromosomes. Proper regulation of telomere length is
critical for genome integrity, regulation of cellular lifespan, aging, and cancer. Over the years,
genetic and biochemical studies have shed an enormous amount of light on how this process is
controlled. However, the cell biology of this process in the crowded nucleus remains poorly
understood, and the timing, dynamics, and spatial coordination of telomere extension are
unknown. To address these gaps in our understanding, we will exploit the MS2 tagging system
and Halo-fluorophore to visualize single molecules of endogenous telomerase in live cells. Here,
we will decipher discrete and critical steps as hTR traffics from Cajal bodies to telomeres.
Contrary to earlier FISH data in fixed cells, our preliminary data using diffraction-limited and
super-resolution imaging modalities combined with single-molecule FISH show that hTR is
broadly distributed throughout the nucleus. At telomeres, we show that following TPP1-driven
recruitment, stable interactions are established between the enzyme and its substrate by
RNA:DNA base pairing. Our goal is to apply photoactivation and photobleaching experiments to
test the role of the catalytic subunit, hTERT, in the gating of hTR between the Cajal bodies and
telomeres. In addition, we will engineer a short telomere to depict telomerase dynamics at
critical telomeres that need to be elongated. Lastly, we will perform a proximity-based labeling
and purification methodology to investigate the factors that control key steps of telomerase
trafficking to short telomeres. All in all, our innovative approach offers a detailed view of the
precise mechanics of telomere extension at physiological timescales and opens many future
avenues for the study of the link between telomere maintenance and aging as well as cancer."

Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a crucial role in keeping the immune system in balance and preventing
autoimmune disease. Defective Treg function leads to autoimmune diseases, while intra-tumor Tregs can block
effective anti-tumor immune responses. Tregs can undergo further specialization in adaptation to their tissue
microenvironment. Recent studies showed that a unique RORgt (retinoic acid–related orphan receptor gamma
t) expressing Treg cell population could be induced in the colon lamina propria. These RORgt+ Tregs play an
important role in the suppression of colon inflammation. In Treg cells, REV-ERBa is highly expressed in RORgt+
colonic Tregs, but not in RORgt- colonic Tregs or spleen Tregs. Mice with Treg-specific deletion of REV-ERB
were more susceptible to TNBS-induced colitis with decreased RORgt+ Treg cells and increased Th1/Th17 cell-
mediated inflammation in the colon. RNA-sequencing experiment showed that the expression of a set of genes
related to Treg function, including CTLA-4, IL-10, and c-Maf, were reduced in REV-ERB deficient colonic Tregs
compared to WT controls. To study the mechanism of gene regulation by REV-ERB in Tregs, Dr. Zheng’s lab
performed Cut & Run assays with WT RORgt+ iTregs using Foxp3, REV-ERBa, and RORgt antibodies to map
their binding peaks genome-wide. The results showed a significant overlap of the binding peaks of these 3
transcription factors, suggesting coordination in gene regulation among Foxp3, REV-ERB, and RORgt in Treg
cells. The overall objective of the proposed study is to define the role of REV-ERB in Treg function. This goal will
be accomplished by dissecting the molecular mechanism of REV-ERB function in RORgt+ Treg cells (Aim 1),
and characterizing the role of REV-ERB in Treg in mouse models of IBD (Aim 2). The outcomes of the proposed
study are expected to reveal the functional and mechanistic role of REV-ERB in RORgt+ Tregs. Such results are
expected to further advance our understanding of how the identity and function of RORgt+ Tregs are established
and maintained. Additionally, this study will provide key insights into how transcriptional repressor such as REV-
ERB serves as key regulator and tune the function of transcriptional activators in Treg cells. Finally, the outcomes
of this study could provide evidence supporting the development of therapeutics targeting REV-ERB for IBD
treatment."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)
phagocytosis and determine how it compares to the phagocytic ability of microglia and its relevance for neurological
disease. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are a pool of progenitors found in the adult brain that give rise to
mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life. Recent work has established that OPCs function as phagocytes
and engulf synapses within both the developing and adult brain. This challenges the long-held notion that the sole
function of OPCs is to generate new oligodendrocytes and establishes a role for OPCs in synapse pruning, similar to
microglia. However, there is currently no understanding of how OPC phagocytosis impacts their progenitor function or
how their phagocytic function compares to microglia. It is also unknown if OPCs function as phagocytes in the context of
neurodegeneration. I will now use a combination of in vitro and in vivo phagocytosis assays and live cell imaging to
compare OPC and microglial phagocytosis under steady-state conditions and during neurodegeneration and determine
how phagocytosis impacts OPC function as progenitor cells. In Aim 1, I will use in vitro phagocytosis assays coupled with
live cell imaging, OPC differentiation analyses, and RNA-sequencing to compare microglia and OPC phagocytosis of
synaptic substrates and determine how phagocytosis impacts OPC differentiation. In Aim 2, I will utilize an animal model
relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS) where the Schafer lab has shown early synapse loss and AAV-driven inhibition of
complement C3 deposition to determine if OPCs function as phagocytes in the context of neurodegeneration, and if this
phagocytosis is complement C3-dependent. The proposed studies will build on emerging work that challenges the
current thinking that microglia are the primary phagocytes of the CNS. It will reveal the role of OPC phagocytosis in
modulating the differentiation capacity of OPCs. It will also determine if OPC phagocytosis is dependent on the
deposition of the complement protein C3. These results will have implications for neurodegenerative diseases, as lack of
OPC differentiation is observed in multiple neurodegenerative states. Additionally, complement is now a target for
therapeutic intervention in a variety of neurological diseases, so understanding how this pathway regulates other cells of
the brain is essential for the effective use of these therapeutics. Finally, the experiments outlined here combine my
strength in OPC biology from graduate school with the expertise in microglia and mechanisms of phagocytosis in my
postdoctoral lab. Together, these studies will give me ideal training to achieve my goal of becoming an independent
researcher studying glia-glia interactions in neurodegeneration."

This multi-Pl R01 is submitted in response to NCI FOA PAR-20-062 Co-infection and Cancer and includes
2 seasoned, collaborative Pis with complementary expertise in microbial carcinogenesis (Richard Peek and
James Fox). H. pylori confers the highest known risk for gastric adenocarcinoma. However, studies by the CoPis
and others have demonstrated that gastric microbiota populations affect cancer risk in synergy with H. pylori.
We have full access to a unique longitudinal, prospective human cohort in Colombia where gastric
adenocarcinoma and H. pylori infections are endemic. Full clinical, endoscopic, and histologic data are available
at baseline and at each interval follow-up out to 26 years, including frozen gastric tissue for microbiota analysis
and culture from the 20- and 26-year timepoints from persons who either progressed histologically or
remained stable, providing a unique opportunity to define disease mechanisms. We also have access to
prospectively obtained gastric tissue from patients at Stanford with or without premalignant lesions, allowing us
to extend these studies into a US population. Our laboratories have developed models that closely recapitulate
the gastric niche to define mechanisms of carcinogenesis within the context of H. pylori and the microbiota. Dr.
Fox has utilized germ-free (GF) INS-GAS mice to demonstrate 1) H. pylori accelerates carcinogenesis in mice
harboring a gastric microbiota compared to GF mice, and 2) colonization with bacteria differentially represented
in high vs. low cancer risk populations modifies the ability of H. pylori to induce gastric injury. Dr. Peek has
developed complex primary gastroid:macrophage:T cell systems to demonstrate that H. pylori drives oncogenic
signaling in a cell- and strain-specific manner and that non-H. pylori gastric species successfully colonize these
models. Collectively, our scientific scope, available resources including cutting-edge metabolomics, and
innovative model systems will allow us to fully address the hypothesis that progression to gastric cancer is
influenced not only by H. pylori virulence constituents, but also by prolonged interactions with members of the
gastric microbiota. which can modulate immune responses. We will address this hypothesis via these Aims.
Aim 1: Identify and define components of the gastric microbiota in persons who did or did not progress towards
gastric cancer using Whole Metagenome Shotgun (WMS} sequencing
Aim 2: Utilize innovative ex vivo systems to define the carcinogenic potential of gastric microbiota species and
prioritize candidates for more definitive in vivo studies of gastric cancer
Aim 3: Utilize novel germ-free rodent models and metabolomics to define causality of high priority gastric
microbiota species and corresponding immune responses linked to disease progression within the gastric niche"

Conformational changes of proteins are required for nearly all biological functions and inappropriate
conformational transitions are associated with numerous pathologies, including gain or loss of function

information on intramolecular dynamics and intermolecular kinetics is critical for biophysical understanding of
structure/function relationships; for mechanistic interpretations of kinetic processes, such as enzyme catalysis
and ligand recognition; for understanding “action at a distance” in allostery or regulation of activity; and for
design of novel proteins and protein ligands, including pharmaceutical agents. Conformational changes in
proteins, including local librations, loop and hinge motions, relative motions between domains, collective
“breathing” of protein cores, ligand-binding or oligomerization reactions, and overall folding-unfolding events,
may be closely coupled, and in some instances rate-limiting, to biological functions such as molecular
recognition, transitions along the catalytic cycle of enzymes, and inhibition or activation of proteins through
intra- or inter-molecular protein-protein interactions. Recent developments, including those from the PI
laboratory, have opened new opportunities for investigation of conformational dynamic processes using NMR
spin relaxation measurements (and other NMR observables) at equilibrium in solution and with atomic site
resolution, without potential complications introduced by non-native modifications necessary for other solution-
state spectroscopic techniques. In addition, close coupling between experimental measurements and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or other theoretical approaches allow feedback with experiment in
interpreting results, formulating hypotheses for on-going investigation, and improving both experimental and
theoretical techniques. The present proposal will use NMR spectroscopic and computational approaches to
explicate the functional roles of conformational transitions in enzyme catalysis, including ribonuclease HI (and
other members of the nucleotidyl-transferase superfamily) and the DNA-repair protein AlkB; in DNA recognition
by transcription factors, including Hox and bZip proteins; and in protein-protein molecular recognition
interactions, including strand-swapping and dimerization by cadherin cell-adhesion proteins. The biological
goals are based on recent advances in the PI laboratory (i) establishing a quantitative relationship between
active-site loop dynamics and enzyme activity for ribonuclease HI homologs, (ii) describing a multi-state
coupled folding and binding mechanism for dimerization of cadherin proteins, and (iii) identifying both pre-
formed and induced conformations of transcription factors and target DNA in tuning selectivity and affinity.
Completion of these goals will provide exquisite insight into strucuture/dynamics/functional relationships in
these systems and enable generalization to a wide range of macromolecular systems of biological importance,
both by the PI and by scientists throughout the U. S. research enterprise."

The goal of this fast-track SBIR proposal is to increase patient adherence to SBIRT-related recommendations
given to patients by a primary care provider (PCP). The success of SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and
Referral to Treatment) in the primary care setting has been inconsistent in terms of patients following through
on treatment referral recommendations, with averages as low as 10%. For a variety of reasons, many patients,
irrespective of their specific disease, do not adhere well to clinical recommendations. One way to improve
adherence has been to personalize the recommendations for each individual’s needs, especially using digital
technology, such as apps. The aim of NIDA to develop a sophisticated smart phone based tool for improving
patient follow up to SBIRT recommendations is therefore well justified.
CHESS Health has already developed an automated digital tool (eIntervention) with key elements requested
by this RFA. eIntervention is designed to encourage patient adherence to PCP recommendations following
SBIRT. Using a variety of the RFA required functionalities, eIntervention is designed to facilitate and motivate
each patient to enter treatment, once that patient has been identified by SBIRT as having a substance use
disorder (SUD) or as being at risk of such. eIntervention is commercially available and was developed in
response to customer requests. However, eIntervention does not contain all of the functionalities requested by
NIDA in this RFA and we do not have data to validate efficacy. Such validation is important for supporting wide
spread dissemination. We propose to enhance our existing eIntervention solution with new functionalities that
address the requirements set forth in this RFA and carry out a randomized study of efficacy.
In Phase I, our Specific Aim is to evaluate feasibility of our program for improving adherence to SBIRT
recommendations to patients from PCPs. This Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks:
Task 1: Add functionality to our prototype that address most requirements outlined in the RFA.
Task 2: Demonstrate acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the prototype eIntervention in
improving patient linkage to and engagement in indicated follow-up specialty SUD care.
If shown to be feasible, in Phase II, our Specific Aim is to evaluate a near commercial quality product that
contains all of the features required by the RFA. The Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks:
Task 1: Modifications to the program (months 1-3).
Task 2: The randomized clinical trial to test efficacy of SBIRT/eIntervention compared to SBIRT/TAU.
Criteria for Success: We aim to double the current rate of follow-up specialty SUD care (e.g. go from ~17% to
an achieved rate of ~35%), a highly impactful effect. All patients, including those identified as at risk, must
show a reduction in substance use. Patients and PCPs must rank the program with an average of 3.5 on a
five-point Likert scale for usability, satisfaction, and willingness to use with the program again."
10767125,"Veterans are disproportionately affected by peripheral artery disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease
(CAD) because of high rates of tobacco use in the veteran population. Up to one-third of the saphenous
vein bypass grafts performed for either PAD or CAD fail secondary to a process called neointimal
hyperplasia. We have established a new model to study saphenous vein grafts by implanting human
saphenous veins into immunodeficient nude rats. This model develops significant neointimal
hyperplasia, unlike prior animal models using animal vein grafts. Our previous work on human
saphenous vein grafts suggest that adventitial cells may prevent neointimal hyperplasia and graft failure.
We have also been testing a novel therapeutic agent SB-030, which when administered luminally,
decreases the neointimal hyperplasia reaction to angioplasty-induced arterial injury in humans
presumably by inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation. This proposal will test whether adventitial
cells can be used therapeutically to decrease neointimal hyperplasia. In addition, we will test whether
inhibiting adventitial cell proliferation by applying SB-030 to the adventitia causes increased neointimal
hyperplasia. In contrast, we expect luminal application of SB-030 will decrease neointimal hyperplasia by
inhibiting smooth muscle cells. These results will be relevant for future treatment of vein grafts with SB-
030 or other therapeutics that target both adventitial cells and medial smooth muscle cells. Successful
completion of this proposal will better establish the new model, demonstrate whether adventitial cells
reduce neointimal hyperplasia, and determine whether adventitial or luminal application of a novel
therapeutic will best inhibit neointimal hyperplasia. This will lead to new therapies to improve the
success of vein bypass grafts for patients."

DNA double-strand break (DSB) is one of the most toxic DNA lesions in cells. DSB causes
immediate chromosome breakage and must be repaired before chromosome segregation.
Unfaithful repair of DSB may lead to genome rearrangements and ultimately tumorigenesis.
Research in my laboratory strives to define the mechanism and regulation of DSB repair where
homologous recombination (HR) serves as a major repair means. Eukaryotic single-stranded
DNA binding protein, RPA, as a universal DNA replication and repair factor, is involved in
multiple stages of the HR pathway including the DSB end resection by the Sgs1-Dna2
helicase/nuclease ensemble. Our recent work discovered RPA as a processive unit for Dna2-
catalyzed ssDNA digestion, which provided a novel perspective on the regulation of ssDNA
accessibility by RPA and inspired us to explore how RPA may serve as an integral component
of the Sgs1-Dna2 machinery and coordinate their actions. Unexpectedly, our work on the Dna2-
RPA ensemble revealed a novel role of Dna2 in the processing of an undefined intermediate in
DSB repair likely derived from DNA repair synthesis and led us to discover an RPA mutant that
constitutively dimerizes, which may serve as a powerful tool to understand the function of RPA
dimerization. Both directions will also be explored in this proposal. Given the conservation of the
HR pathway between yeast and humans, our work will shed light on the mechanism of DSB
repair not only in yeast but also in human cells."

Infections due to resistant Gram+ organisms are on the rise, likely due to a variety of factors including longer
hospital stay, increased frequency of invasive procedures and pervasive antibiotic therapy. Compounding
the problem is the emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) among many Gram+ pathogens (MRSA, S.
epidermidis, Enterococcus and S. pneumoniae). Despite antibiotic stewardship and infection control, new
agents against these Gram+ pathogens are urgently needed. After screening a ~60,000 preselected
compound library, we obtained DNAC-2, a 4-hydroxyquinoline derivative, that exhibited antibacterial activities
against MRSA and Enterococcus. We subsequently synthesized 3 series of analogues involving over 50
compounds. Two of these analogues in the 2th series, JRS-3-56 (compound 1) and JRS-4-32 (compound 2),
were cidal against MRSA, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis and E. faecium, with MIC ≤0.2 μg/ml. However, both 1
and 2 have poor predicted aqueous solubility with high cLogP (7.7 and 6.0, respectively). Conversion of
quinoline to quinazoline for 1 improved the cLogP (from 6.06 to 5.08) but led to a slight increase in MIC (0.25
to 2 µg/ml). In the latest series, we introduced a carbonyl group at C-4 and a C to N substitution at the C-1
position, yielding compounds 3 and 4 with low cLogPs and very low MIC (0.06 µg/ml for USA300),
accompanied by a much tighter SAR. Using macromolecular synthesis assays, membrane-specific dye FM4-
64 and electron microscopy studies, we have evidence that 1 and 2 target the Gram+ membrane (3 and 4
also resulted in membrane defect as detected by the FM4-64 dye), but not Gram- or eukaryotic membrane,
thus implying some degree of specificity. However, the exact target of these compounds which likely differs
from daptomycin, is not known. In this application, we seek to define the mechanism of action of these
quinoline/quinolone derivatives and further explore the SAR that governs in vitro and in vivo activities and
drug disposition properties. Accordingly, we have the following specific aims: 1) design and synthesize
quinoline/quinolone derivates by defining the SAR that governs activity against major Gram+ pathogens and
drug disposition properties (MIC, solubility, overt toxicity and serum binding etc.); 2) delineate the mechanism
of action of the quinoline/quinolone derivatives with genetic, biochemical and biophysical tools; 3)
pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies where candidates compounds will be evaluated for their drug
disposition properties to ensure safety and selectivity followed by selection of “lead” compounds for full PK
evaluation and efficacy studies with two animal models. The goal of these studies is to identify “druggable
membrane-active compounds” with broad Gram+ activity. If successful, we believe these compounds will
represent a new class of membrane-active compounds that offer a significant advance in drug development."
10779240,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major challenge in understanding how organs take shape is addressing how increases in morphological
complexity arise. Over the past half-century, our understanding of such symmetry-breaking has been
predominantly developed through molecular, genetic, and cellular frameworks. However, symmetry-breaking in
developing organs occurs at scales far larger than their individual molecular and cellular constituents, prompting
the question of how events at the molecular and cellular scale relate to the physical self-organization of organ
structure. To address this question, my lab centers its studies on the behavior of cell collectives, an understudied
nexus that serves as a mediator between subcellular processes and functionally relevant organ morphology. Our
prior work in considering collective cell, or supracellular, material properties has led to the hypothesis that the
role of key signals, known as morphogens, in sculpting organs is to influence cells and extracellular matrix such
that tissue material properties or “phase” are modulated. Thus, a key functional role of morphogens may be to
create diversity in supracellular mechanical behavior by fluidizing or solidifying tissue domains that result in the
increase of complexity in organ form. Here we will use a unique set of supracellular behavioral assays to
investigate new roles for signals in shaping emerging morphologies. We will first link where and when
morphogens are expressed in the forming follicle to the transcriptional profiles and multicellular architectures
that accompany morphogen activity (Aim 1). We will then leverage a constellation of novel collective cell
mechanics platforms to probe the functional consequence of morphogen activity at the supracellular scale. (Aim
2). Finally, through the integration of theory and experiment, we will explore the hypothesis that interacting
supracellular phases generate a mechanical instability in the skin that is sufficient to shape the organ (Aim 3).
Together these studies stand to highlight the need to consider supracellular properties necessary for tissue
symmetry breaking that are not reducible to the properties of individual cells. At the same time, our studies will
identify the molecular and cellular component parts that enable the diversification of emergent supracellular
material properties. Our investigations will pave the way for a generalizable paradigm for how morphogens can
create adjacent material phases within a single tissue, thereby generating the potential for mechanical self-
organization at the tissue scale. Finally, these studies will shed light on the multi-scale nature of organ formation
and serve as a foundation for future work aimed at addressing congenital defects, engineering stromal tissues
of specific material properties, and the rational channeling supracellular self-organizing potential in regenerative
medicine."
10795071,"Functional genomic tools, such as CRISPR/cas genome editing, are critical for investigating the
biology of genes and have transformed our understanding of genotype-to-phenotype relationships.
However, the limited number of species with genome modification methods presents a major
bottleneck in implementing comprehensive, comparative studies of gene function. For instance,
squamates (lizard and snakes) include more than 11,000 described species and comprise 40% of all
amniote species. Yet basic gene editing methods are only available in a single species, the brown
anole lizard (Anolis sagrei). Here, we propose to: 1) establish CRISPR/cas gene editing in a second
lizard group, the geckos; 2) develop advanced gene editing methods for the introduction of precise
sequence substitutions, insertions, and deletions in lizards (in both Anolis and geckos); and 3)
disseminate lizard gene editing techniques through training materials and workshops and the
production of genome-edited lizards for researchers. The development of gene editing tools in
geckos will increase the number of squamate models available for functional genomic work and
facilitate the generalization of gene function studies across squamates and amniotes. Furthermore,
growing the functional genomic toolkit in lizards to include more precise gene editing methods will
expand the scope of questions that can be addressed in this phenotypically diverse group."

CD8 T cells are a critical component of the immune response to intracellular infections and malignancies given
their ability to directly kill target cells in tissues. After the resolution of an acute infection, a small proportion of
antigen-specific T cells persists as long-lived memory cells and provides protection upon re-infection. Memory
CD8 T cell populations show a spectrum of phenotypic, functional, and recirculation capacities as well as the
potential for secondary memory formation. Memory T cells have traditionally been studied in blood and
secondary lymphoid organs, with central memory cells found recirculating between the blood and lymphoid
tissues and effector memory T cells found in blood and tissues. It is now understood that long-lived, tissue-
resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) comprise a significant portion of the memory immune response, mediating
host protection at sites of potential reinfection and, in some cases, causing immunopathology associated with
chronic infection and autoimmunity. We find that the transition of immune cells from a itinerant, recirculating
pattern to established residence in a specific tissue is accompanied by significant changes in gene expression
and genome accessibility. These T cell adaptations to the unique tissue environment mediate formation, survival,
and function of TRM populations. The transcriptional repressor Hic1 has recently been identified as a critical
regulator of the small intestine (SI) TRM population generated in response to acute viral infection. These findings
raise many new questions, such as (1) Which cues and cellular interactions regulate these adaptations? (2) How
are transcriptional circuits controlling tissue residency, immune function, and memory potential integrated? And
(3) What are the specific targets of Hic1 and its mechanisms of action? In this proposal, we will address the
underlying mechanisms of Hic1 activity in establishing TRM, its role in the transcriptional network governing SI
residency, and its importance in TRM secondary memory potential. We propose the following: Aim 1: Define the
role of Hic1 in the regulation of TRM differentiation and maintenance and the signals that induce Hic1 expression
in infection; Aim 2: Elucidate the role of Hic1 in the transcriptional network governing CD8 T residency in the
small intestine, and Aim 3: Determine the tissue-specific regulation of TRM fates and the potential for proliferation
and contribution to memory responses. These studies will inform efforts to induce “tissue-tailored” immune
responses to improve vaccine efficacy."

The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and
graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the
Center for Neural Science (CNS) and the Cognition and Perception (C&P) program in the Department of
Psychology, reflecting the dual roles of brain and behavior. The TPCN program faculty consist of 24 highly
productive PIs. The TPCN will be a continuation of the NIH-funded program run successfully at NYU from 2016
to 2021, which trained 24 undergraduate and 12 predoctoral students and built an infrastructure of community
activities. The TPCN fits well with NYU’s strengths: a) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of
computational neuroscientists, and NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since
1994 b) In the past year alone, the two participating departments have hired four primarily
computational/theoretical faculty; c) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as
1992; d) program faculty have a strong track record of wide-ranging collaborations as well as of co-mentoring
predoctoral students.
 Each trainee in the TPCN will complete a year of coursework, laboratory research, and TPCN-specific
professional development activities, which include skill tutorials, orientation on the next career stage,
workshopping each other’s writings and presentations, faculty openly discussing the backstories of their
careers (“Growing up in Science”), predoctoral trainees mentoring undergraduate trainees, and didactic journal
clubs preceding computational neuroscience seminars by external speakers. Together, these activities form a
comprehensive preparation for an academic career in computational neuroscience.
 A major goal of the TPCN will be to increase access to and diversity in computational neuroscience
especially at the undergraduate level. This requires making hidden curriculum explicit and compensating for
students’ pre-college differences in opportunity. We will realize this through a variety of measures, including a)
holding a math boot camp preceding application to TPCN; b) providing earlier exposure to research; c)
introducing undergraduate lab rotations; d) reducing the default duration of a traineeship from 2 to 1 years,
thus offering broader access."

The ~1 billion neurons that form the human brainstem are organized at multiple scales, ranging from their cell
type-specific patterns of dendritic arborization, to local circuits embedded within large-scale projection systems
spanning the brainstem, and a complex nuclear architecture. In this project, we will image across this vast range
of scales to build technologies to create a multiscale atlas akin to Google Earth for the human brainstem to
visualize brainstem-wide networks and zoom in to the level of individual, labeled cells and their connectivity at
micrometer resolution within the context of individual nuclei. This dramatic advance will be made possible
through the use of an array of imaging technologies, including light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM),
tissue clearing, immunohisto-chemistry (IHC), 2-photon expansion microscopy (2PEM), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and newly developed techniques in polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-
OCT). PS-OCT in particular is a potentially transformative technology as it provides micrometer resolution over
large volumes of tissue, images all of the tissue (as opposed to fluorescence), does not require mounting and
staining, can be automated, is essentially distortion free as it images the tissue prior to cutting, and with
innovations we propose in our project, allows direct measures of 3D axonal orientation. LSM-based IHC will
provide molecular, morphological and spatial properties of cells and their projections that will enable us to nuclear
boundaries to place the connections in a nuclear context, 2PEM will provide direct validation of the 3D-PSOCT,
and the OCT will also enable us to remove the distortions induced by cutting and clearing, and transfer
information to intact brainstem and whole-hemisphere MRI for quantitative atlasing and in vivo inference."

In 2022, 29.7% of married women of reproductive age had an unmet need for family planning in Uganda,
meaning they wanted to avoid pregnancy but were not using a modern contraceptive method. Filling the unmet
need for family planning has important public health implications, including reductions in pregnancy-related
health risks and deaths, and infant mortality. On the supply-side, community platforms to deliver family
planning, as well as provider capacity to provide effective methods, need to be strengthened, but such efforts
will not be optimized without addressing multilevel demand-side barriers to contraceptive use. Misinformation
and fear of contraceptive side-effects, relationship dynamics, peer and family influence, and broader
community norms promoting large family size and traditional gender roles influence family planning. We
propose to test the Family Health=Family Wealth (FH=FW) multi-level, community-based intervention, which
employs health system strengthening efforts alongside transformative community dialogues to alter individual
attitudes and the perception of community norms that discourage family planning. Community dialogues are
delivered to groups of couples over 5-sessions enhanced to simultaneously address individual and
interpersonal-level determinants of family planning and serve as a platform for community-based family
planning and linkage to facility-based family planning services. The study aims are to: (1) In a cluster
randomized trial, compare the efficacy of the FH=FW intervention vs. a time/attention matched comparator
intervention at increasing modern contraceptive use and reducing unintended pregnancy among couples with
an unmet need for family planning through 24-months, and identify potential mediators of the intervention
effect. (2) Determine the intervention’s effect on, and determinants of, contraceptive continuation. (3) Through
a mixed-methods process evaluation, explore factors affecting the implementation of the intervention in order
to improve feasibility, acceptability, and the likelihood of future adoption and sustainment."
10762967,"The gram-negative obligatory intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech) infects monocytes-
macrophages, and causes the emerging tick-borne zoonosis human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). Our long-
term goal is to identify targets for intervention that can prevent and treat HME. As an obligatory intracellular
aerobe, Ech is dependent upon host iron for survival. We found that pretreating human macrophages with the
iron chelator deferoxamine resulted in a complete block of Ech infection, suggesting Ech acquires iron from the
host labile cellular iron (LCI) pool. Paradoxically, the host LCI pool catalyzes formation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which is a key mechanism of host defense against intracellular pathogens. Our project's
objective is to determine the mechanism by which Ech modulates the host LCI pool to acquire iron for its
growth, while averting ROS-induced host cell response. By understanding the process by which Ech acquires
iron, we may be able to prevent or limit infection. We previously found functional links between Type IV
Secretion System (T4SS, VirB/D), iron, and superoxide dismutatses of Ech and host cells.
Ferritin contains
heavy chain (FTH) and light chain (FTL) subunits; in our preliminary study we found that the T4SS effector,
Ehrlichia translocated factor (Etf)-3
interacts directly with FTL, and colocalizes with LC3 (ATG8), a maker of
autophagosomes. Thus, o
ur central hypothesis is that Ech induces ferritinophagy, a form of selective
autophagy that degrades ferritin and increases the LCI pool by secreting Etf-3, and safely captures iron. We
will test our central hypothesis with three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Analyze the interaction between Etf-3 and FTL:
Etf-3 binding kinetics to human native ferritin; temporal pattern of Etf-3-FTL binding during the course of Ech
infection; Etf-3 binding to other molecules in Ech-infected and uninfected cells, including nuclear receptor
coactivator 4 (NCOA4); and cellular co-localization of Etf-3 and ferritin. Aim 2. Determine if Ech induces
ferritinophagy that coincides with lowering ROS via T4SS, and if Etf-3-induced ferritinophagy is required for
productive Ech infection; determine the roles of FTL, FTH, and NCOA4 in Ech infection; compare Etf-3-induced
ferritinophagy to Etf-1-induced Rab5-regulated autophagy; determine if NCOA4 mediates Etf-3-induced
ferritinophagy; and map the Etf-3 domains/segments that induce ferritinophagy. Aim 3. Determine if blocking
Etf-3 expression and binding to FTL inhibits Ech-induced ferritinophagy and Ech infection. Elucidating how
intracellular Ech acquires iron will 1) further our understanding of intracellular bacterial proliferation and
survival, and 2) reveal the role of iron homeostasis that may be a critical target for development of new
approaches to prevent or limit Ech infection. If our hypothesis is supported, the results will also reveal a unique
molecular mechanism of ferritinophagy that may be inhibited, benefiting the broader fields of infectious
diseases and iron homeostasis."

Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid peptide that can be covalently conjugated to substrates to alter protein fate in
diverse ways, regulating protein degradation, trafficking, subcellular localization and protein-protein
interactions. Given its versatility, ubiquitin regulates many fundamental cellular processes, and its
dysregulation is associated with many human diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. Ubiquitin
networks include conjugating and deconjugating enzymes as well as effector pathways comprised of ubiquitin
binding proteins that direct the fate of ubiquitin-modified substrates. All of these elements work together to
“write”, “read”, and “edit” the ubiquitin code – which ultimately consists of ubiquitin polymers of different lengths
and topologies that determine which effector pathways are engaged. Here, we describe two main research
directions that will result in a deeper understanding of the ubiquitin code and how it regulates diverse cellular
functions, including stress signaling and membrane trafficking. The first research direction will address how
phosphorylation of ubiquitin at the Ser57 position regulates stress responses in yeast and human cells. The
proposed studies will build on our recent discovery of a small group of Ser57 ubiquitin kinases conserved from
yeast to humans and will include genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches. Specifically, we will
determine how these kinases and Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin contribute to the cellular stress response,
and we will address how ubiquitin phosphorylation alters its interaction profile and engagement with effector
pathways. This research will contribute transformative new insights into the biology of ubiquitin and
proteostasis. The second research direction will address how human glucose transporters are regulated by
ubiquitin modification and endocytic trafficking. Glucose transporters of the GLUT family are key regulators of
cellular glucose homeostasis, and yet regulation of their trafficking and quality control remain poorly
characterized. Here, we describe lines of investigation based on our recent findings that GLUT1 endocytic
trafficking is regulated by specific ubiquitin modifications. These studies have important implications for cellular
glucose homeostasis and human diseases including GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome and many types of cancer.
Together, these research directions will result in a deeper understanding of the ubiquitin code, membrane
trafficking, and stress responses in eukaryotic cells."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of manmade congeners with dual hydro- and oleo-
phobic properties, which is why they have been widely used in firefighting foams, as well as in a multitude of
other products such as food packaging, paints, pesticides, and microelectronics. Given their extensive use, high
water solubility, and resistance to conventional wastewater treatment methods, PFAS have been detected in
public water supplies all over the country causing concern for potential toxic human health effects given their
environmental persistence. Flocculation is a widely used separation technique in the removal of suspended
solids from water and wastewater. However, traditional flocculants (e.g., inorganic salts and polymeric systems)
form aggregate flocs that are usually loosely packed, contain a large amount of water due to their hydrophilicity
and as such, require large settling tanks due to the slow process of separation that is required to collect the
solids. Furthermore, they have seldom been used to remove dissolved species like PFAS. To address these
issues, BAM has developed EnviroFloc: an innovative “smart” polymeric flocculant that consists of a temperature
responsive compound, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), modified with cationic co-monomers and/or fluorinated
co-monomers. The combination of these three components results in a polymer which can rapidly capture the
dissolved PFAS molecules and form insoluble solid aggregates at temperatures above the lower critical solution
temperature (LCST) The core advantages of this system include: (1) Low water retention in the sedimented floc:
dissolved PFAS molecules are captured by the dissolved polymer at ambient temperature and then collected
into an insoluble densely packed solid pellet above the transition temperature resulting in a smaller solid waste
stream compared to other remediation technologies. (2) Fast kinetics, flocculation occurs within seconds to
minutes as compared to several hours for other flocculant systems. (3) Relatively low energy input required to
flocculate given EnviroFloc’s LCST being close to ambient temperature. (4) Little-to-no pretreatment needed of
the contaminated stream when applied as secondary treatment for challenging PFAS wastes, RO concentrate,
and IX brine. More specifically, aim 1 focuses on the development of EnviroFloc polymer flocculants for
optimized flocculation performance. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate EnviroFloc regeneration via temperature
assisted solid-liquid extraction to determine removal efficiency and EnviroFloc reusability, and specific Aim 3 will
demonstrate EnviroFloc performance efficiency as a secondary treatment step in multiple case studies (e.g., RO
concentrates and IX brine). Finally, specific Aim 4 will design, simulate, and demonstrate feasibility of a PFAS
treatment unit. This Phase II SBIR project will accomplish the key tasks necessary to prepare for
commercialization of BAM’s EnviroFloc and the associated treatment unit specifically for PFAS water treatment."
10878893,"Neural circuits are the underlying functional units of the human brain. By receiving glutamatergic (Glut)
inputs through cortico-striatal pathway, the striatum acts as an integrative hub to coordinate multiple higher-order
behavior and cognition. Dysfunction of the striatum and the associated neural circuitry development have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders e.g., schizophrenia. Despite the
functional importance, studies of such long-distance human cortical-subcortical network development and
connectivity have been significantly hindered due to lack of suitable microphysiological platforms. A major
unresolved hurdle in current human cells-based assays is that in vitro cultures weakly recapitulate the key biology
of neural microphysiological system, especially the long-distance projections in both two and three dimensions
(2D/3D). In this grant, we propose to fill this critical gap, by reconstructing human cortico-striatal circuits on-a-
chip to recapitulate and monitor long-range brain circuitry development and connectivity in vitro, in response to
PAR-20-082. We will reconstruct human cortico-striatal circuits by developing a novel 2D/3D microfluidic
microelectrode arrays (MEA) chip together with the co-culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)-derived
region-specific neurons or brain organoids. Coupling with MEA allows us to monitor brain circuit dynamics in a
high-throughput manner. Further, our innovative implementation of microfluidic channels and arrays of surface
and probe electrodes in 3D configurations enables resemblance of 3D brain circuits for high-order brain function
studies. We hypothesize that human cortico-striatal circuits on a microfluidic-MEA chip can reconstitute striatal
synchrony, a key striatal physiology which is absent in unconnected striatal neurons, and the reconstructed 3D
neural circuits between cortical and striatal organoids can resemble high-order brain function e.g., brain waves
like in vivo. We will reconstruct human cortico-striatal circuits by using our novel microfluidic MEA chip together
with the co-culture of hPSCs-derived cortical and striatal neurons in Aim 1. We will monitor axon projections and
neural network dynamics during circuitry development and determine whether striatal synchrony is driven by
cortical Glut inputs by pharmacological manipulation of Glut transmission. In Aim 2, we will develop a 3D
microfluidic MEA chip with microchannels and microelectrodes integrated in 3D configurations. We will
reconstruct 3D cortico-striatal circuits by assembling cortical and striatal organoids on-a-chip. We expect 3D
brain circuits on-a-chip approach will resemble brain waves (a.k.a. large-scale neural oscillation) like human
brains. This proposal presents a novel approach to reconstitute well-defined long-range human circuit in vitro.
Our model can be benchmarked against existing human and rodent in vitro brain circuitry systems and exceed
state-of-the-art by coupling high-throughput functional readout and reconstructing 3D brain circuits on-a-chip.
The future pathological studies by using patients-derived brain circuitry on-a-chip models (e.g., using SCZ
patient-derived hPSCs) could potentially illustrate the circuit-based etiology and provide novel therapeutic target."

data for analyses of rare diseases, and 4) address health disparities and inequities. Thus, FL can be noted as a
novel paradigm for multi-site collaborations, enabling access to ample and importantly diverse data, essential to
developing robust models generalizable in unseen data. To this end, we have developed the Federated Tumor
Segmentation (FeTS) platform and the Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) library, as open-source tools with a
commercially friendly license that have facilitated a) the largest to-date real-world federation, involving 3D brain
tumor MRI data from 71 sites across 6 continents, and b) the very first computational challenge in FL, forming
the first benchmarking environment and dataset in the field. This FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure has further been
used to c) identify tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in histopathology images and d) segment dense tissue in 2D
digital mammography (DM), highlighting its generalizability in different imaging and disease types. Building upon
our successful FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure, we propose to enhance its functionality with new developments on
privacy-aware FL towards classification workloads and evaluate it on a first-of-its-kind use case on breast cancer
(BC) risk assessment. BC is the most diagnosed cancer in the US, the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer
in women, and screening is performed routinely with 2D digital mammography (DM) for women in their 40s-50s.
However, DM yields a lot of false positives and unnecessary subsequent procedures. To alleviate these issues,
3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) has been developed and increasingly replacing DM. Our group has
developed novel volumetric breast density (VBD) measures from DBT scans. Building upon our team’s collective
pioneering work in FL and BC risk assessment, in this proposal we focus on developing a trustworthy, zero-code
principle FL framework for training AI-based classification models and built-in functionality to i) generate realistic
synthetic data, matching local population characteristics, for data augmentation & privacy preservation, and ii)
automatically determine quantitative & interpretable settings of optimal privacy preservation. We will use this
framework to perform the largest to-date evaluation of training deep-learning models for BC risk assessment
using DBT VBD measures and other established risk factors while leveraging multi-site, ethnically diverse data
of women undergoing BC screening. We will also disseminate resources via distribution of source code,
deployment to collaborating sites, and organization of training activities. Our overarching goal is an easy-to-use
translatable trustworthy FL framework, lowering the barrier for under-served populations to participate in large-
scale FL studies, and paving the way to address health disparities, towards accelerating discovery healthcare."
10870029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Substantial measures must be taken in the United States to rectify the marked inequities in HIV pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) outcomes among Black adults. PrEP implementation among Black populations is
undermined by individual, interpersonal, and structural barriers rooted in stigma, racism, heterosexism, and
sexism. Improving PrEP provision has become imperative as novel modalities emerge. There is an urgent
need to develop implementation strategies that accelerate equitable PrEP delivery. The goal of this K23 is
to facilitate Dr. Watson’s long-term goal to become an independent investigator focused on the
development of implementation strategies to achieve equitable HIV prevention outcomes among Black
populations. The proposed K23 will focus on designing and testing a multifaceted implementation strategy
to support PrEP provision for Black primary care patients, grounded in an adapted conceptual framework
that includes constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and
Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory. Dr. Watson’s proposed research plan will consist of training objectives
in (1) qualitative research, (2) behavioral and social science research (BSSR), (3) community-engaged
research, and (4) implementation science. With a focus on equity-centered applications within
implementation science and community-engaged research, she requires further training in qualitative
research, BSSR, and trial design to develop and pilot an implementation strategy to increase local PrEP
provision capacity. These training objectives will be achieved through mentorship from an exemplary
multidisciplinary mentorship team, complementary research aims, professional development activities, and
coursework. Specifically, she plans to: (Aim 1) Identify key provider-, practice-, and community-level CFIR-
based determinants of local PrEP delivery; (Aim 2) Develop a theory-informed multifaceted implementation
strategy that follows a destigmatizing sexual health framework to accelerate equitable PrEP delivery for
adult Black primary care patients; (Aim 3) Conduct a 12-month two-arm pilot trial to evaluate implementation
strategy feasibility and acceptability at four medical practices that provide primary care services. The results
of this study will be important for the field of implementation science as it focuses on facilitating theory-
informed behavior changes among providers and practice leadership to accelerate equitable PrEP provision
for Black primary care patients. Findings from the pilot will inform the design and submission of an R01
application for a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the implementation strategy in year 4. The
proposal will form a strong foundation for Dr. Watson’s continued development toward an independently
funded research career as an implementation scientist invested in the development of implementation
strategies to achieve equitable HIV prevention care outcomes among Black adults in the U.S."
10763386,"In neurons, membrane depolarization leads to the expression of immediate early gene transcription factors (IEG-TFs), including NPAS4, that regulate programs of gene expression associated with plasticity. IEG-TFs are widely used as tools to identify task-relevant neurons in vivo, yet it is unclear if these proteins are induced in response to changes in the action potential (AP) output or synaptic inputs (EPSPs) to the neuron. Even less is known about whether APs and EPSPs can lead to distinct patterns of gene regulation and cellular phenotypes. This information “transfer function” is an essential component of how neurons monitor and regulate their own activity. In the specific case of NPAS4, an IEG-TF that regulates excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance, studying this transfer function will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders that stem from dysregulation of E-I balance. We have developed an acute hippocampal slice preparation from the mouse that allows us to independently evoke APs or EPSPs, from defined populations of inputs, within the context of an intact circuit. We propose investigating the activity requirements for NPAS4 expression and the divergent genomic and synaptic regulation that follows from each type of
stimulus. We have used this approach to demonstrate that APs and EPSPs lead to NPAS4 expression with distinct spatio-temporal profiles and have extensive preliminary results characterizing the unexpected underlying mechanisms. Using the methods developed for this proposal, in combination with electrophysiology, optical, and sequencing techniques, we are poised to determine how APs and EPSPs differentially impact activity-dependent gene regulation and synapse function. This proposal is a significant departure from how IEG-TFs are typically studied. The execution of these aims will yield important new insights into the mechanics of activity-dependent gene regulation in neurons and how this biology is disrupted in disorders of the brain such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and schizophrenia."
10761911,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that underlie the neurological
consequences of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC is a profoundly complex genetic disorder caused
by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and characterized by benign tumor growth in multiple systems
in the body. TSC is associated with epilepsy in up to 90% of patients that is often refractory to surgical or
targeted pharmacological intervention. In addition to seizures, TSC-associated neurological disorders (TANDs)
are present in up to 85% and intellectual disability is present in up to 70% of patients. Interestingly, single
TSC1 or TSC2 mutations can have differential effects between affected individuals, and even identical
inherited variants can result in different disease profiles. This indicates significant heterogeneity in patient
outcomes, the mechanisms for which is currently unknown; understanding the mechanism for this difference in
prognosis will allow us to identify novel therapeutic approaches capable of modifying outcome in TSC.
 We recently developed and validated a model system of this heterogeneity to improve our ability to
probe the basic biology of TSC and explore the neural network differences underlying seizures and TANDs.
Our novel mice have a germline Tsc1 heterozygous knockout which, when introduced to controlled genetic
background diversity, faithfully recapitulate patient heterogeneity in TSC outcomes with the clinically relevant
gene dosage and expression pattern. We have remarkable preliminary data showing that the same Tsc1
haploinsufficiency results in a spectrum of background-dependent differences in TSC outcomes. This spectrum
allows us to explore how networks underlying cognition and seizure are differentially affected by the same
precipitating genetic insult. We hypothesize that genetic background-associated differences in seizure
and TANDs outcomes resulting from Tsc1 haploinsufficiency will manifest as changes in neuronal
dynamics, partially mediated by aberrant astrocyte modulation of these neuronal dynamics.
 We will test this hypothesis with the following aims: 1) Phenotype the repertoire of behavioral
impairments in Tsc1 haploinsufficient mice, 2) Characterize the relationship between changes in neuronal
dynamics, seizure and TANDs, 3) Describe changes in excitatory/inhibitory dynamics and explore the role of
non-neuronal populations in changes in E/I balance that underlie epilepsy."

Our lab studies the mechanisms by which cells and organisms respond to genetic change.
The genetic landscape faced by a living cell is constantly changing. Developmental transitions, environmental
shifts, and pathogenic invasions lend a dynamic character to both the genome and its activity pattern. We
study a variety of natural mechanisms that are utilized by cells adapting to genetic change. These include
mechanisms activated during normal development and systems for detecting and responding to foreign or
unwanted genetic activity. At the root of these studies are questions of how a cell can distinguish ""self"" vs.
""nonself"" and ""wanted"" vs. ""unwanted"" gene expression.
Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent model for diverse studies of development, physiology, and
gene expression, with traditional strengths of the model system in genetic and anatomical analysis combining
with a highly-annotated genome and a variety of genetic and epigenetic manipulation techniques. With the
variety of tools, information, and experimental questions, this system remains an attractive choice for varied
studies of gene expression. C. elegans can be quite proficient at silencing foreign nucleic acid, particularly in
the germline; this combined with the other readily manipulated aspects of the system provides an excellent
starting point for the study of responses to foreign information.
Several questions drive our research program
 What features allow certain RNAs to persist and propagate without encoding a replication machinery?
 In what circumstances are non-chromosomal inheritance processes utilized by biological systems?
 How do machineries that propagate non-chromosomal inheritance serve the organism?
 Can we adapt the underlying persistence mechanisms for experimental/therapeutic protocols aimed at
sustained expression or sustained suppression?"
10765522,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
Recombination between chromosomes is required to generate genetic variation, maintain genome integrity,
and ensure proper chromosome segregation during meiosis, the specialized cell division program that
generates haploid gametes such as sperm and eggs. Perturbations in recombination can compromise these
basic cellular functions, ultimately leading to cancer, infertility, or birth defects. Meiotic recombination is
initiated by programmed double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which are repaired using meiosis-specific
mechanisms that 1) favor utilization of the homologous chromosome (instead of the sister chromatid) as the
repair partner; and, 2) promote a crossover outcome of the DSB repair process, which is required for proper
chromosome segregation during meiosis. Although repair of DSBs with the appropriate template (homologous
chromosome) is necessary for proper chromosome segregation and genome integrity, our knowledge of how
germ cells achieve this critical template preference in the presence of nearly identical sequences (sister
chromatids) is limited due to assay limitations in metazoans. The goal of our research program is to
understand how chromosomes are able to access distinct recombination pathways and partners to ensure
faithful genome inheritance. Using in vivo assays we developed in the model system Caenorhabditis elegans,
we have directly detected and analyzed use of the sister chromatid as a repair template during metazoan
meiotic prophase I progression. Building upon our published work, we are defining and establishing how
specific chromosome structures, proteins, and cellular contexts regulate recombination pathway and repair
partner choices to maintain meiotic genome integrity. Using our in vivo assay along with a combination of
genetic, cytological, and sequencing based approaches, we will test models of how particular meiotic
chromosome structures regulate and respond to specific repair pathway and partner choices. We will also
determine how the NSE-2/Mms21 E3 SUMO ligase regulates repair pathway choices and genomic stability
during oogenesis. Using whole genome sequencing, we will define recombination landscape with its molecular
signatures to determine how chromosomal context, sex, and age affect crossover and noncrossover numbers
and distribution across the genome. Finally, we will induce and analyze single DSBs in specific genomic
locations to determine how specific chromosome features affect what pathways and partners are used to repair
a DSB. Overall, these studies will reveal how recombination pathway and partner choices ensure that
chromosomes form the connections necessary for chromosome segregation and repair DSBs for maintaining
genomic integrity during sperm and egg development."

My group seeks to understand, at a fundamental level, the function of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) and sodium
(Nav) channels using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on atomic models. Despite the enormous
progress in structure determination, our comprehension of ion permeation, selectivity, activation, inactivation and
regulation remains incomplete. It is also crucial to keep in mind that a biological membrane is much more than
a simple passive and featureless environment, but a complex dynamical molecular supra-assembly. The activity
of ion channels is affected by a hosts of factors associated with the membrane, often modulated by ion-mediated
electrostatic interactions. Lipids are also directly involved in the activation of specific channels and signaling. MD
simulations based on atomic models can play an important role in understanding the fundamental physical forces
driving the structure and dynamics of these complex biomolecular systems. Using MD, we will study mechanism
of selective ion permeation (knock-on v.s. hard-knock) and the molecular basis of voltage-activation as well as
C-type inactivation. The latter will examine the classic inactivating W434F Shaker K+ channel mutant based on
recent structural information from cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. On the experimental side, we continue to
investigate the factors affecting the activation and inactivation of K+ channels using cryo-EM and X-ray
crystallography. We will also expand the scope of our research by examining the function of Nav channels,
including selectivity, permeation, activation, and inactivation.
 To obtain meaningful computational results from MD simulations, it is crucial to accurately model the
physical forces associated with changes in the electronic distribution, a need that has stimulated the
development of polarizable models going back many decades. Our efforts have focused on developing a
polarizable force field (FF) in the context of the classical Drude oscillator model. The Drude model covers many
molecular components and has been implemented in many simulation programs (CHARMM, NAMD, GROMACS,
OPENMM, and the CHEMSHELL QM/MM software). However, there is a critical need to expand the type of
phospholipids covered to enable the modeling of a broader range of biomembrane processes. We will develop
the FF for the most important charged lipids like phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and
explore the biology of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Calculations of the permeability coefficient
of small molecules will be used to validate the optimized FF. We will also undertake several technical
developments on the propagation of the Drude model, enhanced sampling, conformational sampling, and
machine learning algorithms, etc. The planned simulation studies based on an accurate and computationally
efficient polarizable FF promise new fundamental insight into the function of ion channels and a host of
biomembrane phenomena.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most important model organisms for biomedical
research, because of its biological tractability and because much of its physiology and behavior relies
on signaling pathways that are conserved in humans. The goal of this project is to complement the
highly developed genomics and genetics of C. elegans with a comprehensive structural and functional
characterization of its metabolome. In recent work we have shown that C. elegans utilizes small-
molecule architectures of unanticipated diversity and complexity in endocrine and exocrine signaling
that control almost every aspect of its life history, including development, aging, stress resistance, and
a wide range of behaviors. One major focus of our investigations is the elucidation of the biosynthesis
and perception mechanisms of newly identified small molecule signals, which will reveal how
metabolism and conserved signaling pathways interact to control phenotypes. Of particular interest
are (i) the roles of recently identified endogenous agonists of the nuclear receptor NHR-49, a key
regulator of lipid metabolism and functional ortholog of vertebrate PPARα, (ii) male germline-
dependent metabolites that accelerate development and aging via conserved pathways, including
homologs of mammalian steroid receptors, and (iii) our recent discovery of a modular glucosides that
appear to function as a “second layer” of neurotransmitter signaling. In addition, we will investigate the
biological functions of a new family of nucleoside derivatives we discovered that may interact with
purinergic signaling. Another focus area will be the influence of dietary bacteria on C. elegans small
molecule signaling, motivated by our discovery of unexpected roles for bacterial metabolites, e.g. in
modulating fat metabolism via NHR-49 or in serotonin signaling. Central to the proposed research is
the use of synthetic samples and derivatives of identified signaling molecules for bioassays, mutant
screens, and transcriptomic studies, as well as the in-house developed metabolomics platform
(Metaboseek), which greatly accelerates compound identification and functional annotation.
Successful conclusion of this project will provide a structural and functional annotation small molecule
signaling networks in C. elegans, substantially increasing our understanding of conserved pathways
that control development, aging and metabolism, as well as corresponding disease-relevant pathways
in mammals. The small-molecule knowledge generated will not only enable future efforts aimed at
more varied chemical genetic screens exploring additional aspects of the biology and ecology of C.
elegans, but also of nematode species relevant in agriculture or medicine. Furthermore, methodology
developed for characterizing C. elegans signaling molecules will facilitate similar studies toward
structural and functional characterization of small molecule metabolites from other model organisms."

Training: My research over the past eight years has focused primarily on elephant endocrinology, health, and
aging. The work has shown that there are many similarities between elephants and humans (e.g., morbidities,
life history, socialness, emotional complexity), and that leveraging information gathered by studying elephants
may improve human health and aging. The proposed K01 career development training plan builds on that
experience but identifies three areas that require additional training: (1) develop expertise in psychobiology and
behavior, (2) enhance skills in aging science and methods, and (3) build skills in designing and implementing
randomized experiments. Accordingly, we propose intensive topical mentorship, focused coursework, and
contextual learning through the proposed research. This K01 will provide protected time to receive the needed
training to enhance my expertise in these three areas and will propel me to becoming an independent research
scientist focusing on healthy aging. Research: People who have endured adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs) have increased risk of developing physical and psychological diseases later in life. They are 1.6 to 2.4
times more likely to develop obesity, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes as adults, and life expectancy
is reduced by up to 20 years. Understanding how ACEs lead to disease in adulthood is important for developing
interventions to interrupt disease progression. The proposed K01 attempts to address this need through the
following objectives: to demonstrate the value of using the elephant as a model for human aging, and elucidating
how early-life trauma influences an individual’s biological and social trajectory. Like humans, calves are highly
reliant and bonded to their mother, and can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing her killing. The
poaching of random elephants for their tusks has provided a natural experiment to compare highly traumatized
orphaned elephants with non-orphaned elephants in regard to their allostatic load, biological age, cognition, and
disease susceptibility. This will be the first study that we are aware of that uses the elephant to understand the
implications of early-life trauma, while also implementing a randomized experiment. The proposed K01 will not
only demonstrate the value of the elephant to further understand human aging, but it will elucidate how early-life
trauma influences an individual’s biological and social trajectory. Summary: Findings from this study will inform
an R01 grant application to expand the study of early-life trauma and aging using the elephant. This K01 will
develop my new expertise in psychobiology, aging, and randomized experiments. At the end of this award, I will
be a leading independent scientist conducing innovative research in the field of aging."

The University of Kansas (KU) requests renewal of its Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (KU
PREP). KU PREP seeks to train an additional thirty-five scholars over five years to pursue research doctorates
and become leaders in the biomedical workforce, placing special emphasis on increasing the number of
American Indian (AI) scholars conducting doctorate-level biomedical research. KU is a premier research
institution classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a “Doctoral University: Very High Research Activity” and is
a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). KU PREP recruits a diverse array of qualified
scholars and is uniquely positioned to recruit and train AI scholars due to long-standing and wide-ranging
collaborations between KU and Haskell Indian Nations University (both located in Lawrence, Kansas). The
activities of KU PREP scholars are shaped by a comprehensive individual development plan (IDP) that is initiated
prior to the scholars’ arrival on campus and is continually re-evaluated and adjusted by the scholars and the
PREP mentoring team. Research training is a central focus of the IDP, and each KU PREP scholar completes
a research project in a biomedically-focused laboratory that develops the scholar’s ability to create and test a
scientific hypothesis and obtain the skills necessary to conduct independent, reproducible biomedical research.
PREP scholars also enroll in coursework that improves their quantitative/computational and data analysis
competencies and participate in activities focused on developing their oral and written scientific communication
skills. Each scholar’s work culminates with a presentation at the annual KU-Haskell Research Symposium and
the completion of a journal style article on their research project. KU PREP’s Professional and Personal
Development series focuses on promoting scholars’ well-being (e.g., building resilience and addressing common
challenges faced by scientists from underrepresented groups), helping them mature as professionals while
maintaining their cultural identities, and increasing their self-efficacy and science identity. The mentoring team
works closely with scholars to establish and strengthen a comprehensive support network that they will be able
to utilize during PREP and their subsequent doctoral programs. This network includes the scholar’s PREP
research mentor and other KU research collaborators and peers, members of the PREP team, and (ultimately)
the scholar’s graduate research advisor and other individuals/groups specifically identified to provide necessary
support at the scholar’s graduate institution. KU PREP alumni also play a key role in the support network, and
communications between current KU PREP scholars and alumni are now greatly facilitated by our participation
in the KU Alumni Association’s online mentoring network. Regular evaluation of the program allows KU PREP
to build on its successes while addressing challenges and seeking new ways to improve and innovate, in our
efforts to meet the goal of diversifying the biomedical research workforce, particularly concerning the participation
of AI scholars."

Diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications impose enormous burdens on patients and healthcare
systems, making it imperative to define actionable etiologic factors and develop effective, low-cost therapeutic
interventions. Nonenzymatic protein glycation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are
strongly implicated in pathogenesis. The driver of AGE formation is 3-deoxyglucosone (3DG), a highly reactive
dicarbonyl species that also causes acute cellular toxicities by damaging enzymes and DNA and inflaming the
vasculature. Accordingly, the ability to accurately measure 3DG levels and understand its etiology are paramount
to elucidating pathogenesis, limiting its pathogenic effects, and improving clinical management of diabetic
complications. Endogenous 3DG was deemed to arise nonenzymatically from the slow disintegration of glycated
proteins in the body or absorbed from ingested heat-processed foods. We developed new methods to study the
enzymatic activity of fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K), an enzyme thought to repair glycated proteins and prevent
AGE, but an end-product of FN3K activity is 3DG. We discovered that 3DG levels in kidney are higher than
previously anticipated. Our core hypothesis is that FN3K-mediated 3DG formation in cells is a key pathogenic
driver in diabetic complications. Specific Aim 1: we will measure 3DG arising in tissues in relationship to
pathogenesis in the KK.Cg-Ay/J murine model of type-2 diabetes. Specific Aim 2: the impact of a high glycation
diet on 3DG levels will be measured in tissues sensitive to diabetic complications, including in the kidney, heart,
and liver of the diabetic mice. Specific Aim 3: We will define the pharmacodynamic properties and modes of
action for meglumine, an agent, already proven safe, that we discovered has unrecognized medicinal effects,
having provided nephroprotection and prevented triglyceride accumulation in diabetic mice. Specific Aim 4: a
series of FN3K antagonists that we discovered will be characterized to identify a preclinical drug development
candidate. This proposal offers several major innovative elements of high significance and impact in diabetes
translational research. Aim 1 will provide new data developed with methodology we refined to measure FN3K
activity and 3DG formation more accurately, addressing key gaps in knowledge. Aim 2 will explore the linkage
between intracellular 3DG elevation and the consumption of ‘Western’ diets rich in fructosamines—the substrate
for FN3K. Drug safety is paramount for any new diabetes drug. The data from Aim 3 will accelerate the
development of meglumine as an innovative treatment modality—a compound proven extremely safe for chronic
administration—to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy, fatty liver, and potentially other diabetic complications. Aim
4 offers opportunity to deliver first-in-class enzyme inhibitors as potential drug lead candidates. In summary, this
research program will illuminate an unexplored intracellular pathway in diabetes pathogenesis and deliver
unprecedented tools for broader research into the role of 3DG in diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes
complications."

The objective of this proposal is to develop a soft and stretchable tissue-like bioadhesive electronic device for
the treatment of resistant hypertension. Hypertension is a major burden on healthcare systems and an important
contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Although a number of medicines have been used for the treatment
of hypertension, a large portion of patients (more than 10 million) are resistant to medications. Electrical
activation of the carotid sinus baroreflex (CSB) has been proven to a promising strategy to reduce blood pressure
(BP) in drug-resistant hypertension patients. Nevertheless, existing commercial devices for CSB activation have
significant limitations that precludes their practical applications. They are stiff and unable to stretch in response
to the carotid wall's periodic expansion and contraction, which causes tissue damage and inflammation. Besides,
they also require to be sutured to the carotid wall and introduce further damage. Overall, these limitations of
existing devices cause significant patient discomfort, illness, and failure of devices over time, which
precludes their wide application in hypertension therapy. The development of a minimally invasive device for
long-term CSB activation that does not cause harm is an urgent unmet need. Our goal is to develop a next-
generation device for drug-resistant hypertension therapy that can enable long-term efficient, safe, and
minimally invasive non-pharmacological neuromodulation therapies for hypertension. We adopt soft,
stretchable, yet resilient hydrogel-based materials for the fabrication of the devices to match the mechanical
properties of tissues and significantly reduce tissue damage and inflammation. Owing to its intrinsic
stretchability, the whole device can deform with the contraction and expansion of carotid walls and thus
minimize constraint and damage to the carotid. We will also adopt a bioadhesive component in the
proposed system to eliminate the need for suturing of electrical devices on carotid walls, thus significantly
decreasing the invasiveness of implanted devices and increasing the stability of the device-tissue interface.
We propose the following Specific Aims to ensure successful completion of the project. Aim 1) to develop
stretchable and printable bioadhesive materials for suture-free in vivo incorporation and characterization. We will
fabricate 3D-printable stretchable bioadhesive materials to enable stable long-term interfacing between medical
devices and in vivo tissue. Aim 2) to optimize soft and stretchable tissue-like bioelectronic device designs for
optimal long-term tissue-response on dynamic tissue. By optimizing device designs and materials, we will
improve the long-term tissue response of tissue-like bioelectronic devices implanted on the carotid sinus. Aim 3)
to optimize the acute and long-term effectiveness of tissue-like bioelectronic device for electrical stimulation of
carotid sinus baroreflex (CSB). We have an interdisciplinary team with expertise in tissue-like bioelectronics, soft
materials, bioadhesives, additive manufacturing, resistant-hypertension, and carotid sinus baroreflex stimulation
therapy for treatment of hypertension to guarantee the success of this project. The success of this work will
provide a novel device for minimally invasive and long-term activation of the carotid sinus baroreflex for the
treatment of resistant hypertension. This device will have an important positive impact because it introduces
reduced tissue inflammation/damage and significantly increased stability and safety, which benefits millions of
hypertension patients.

10782373,"Title: A novel uterine leiomyosarcoma mouse model for therapeutic development
PROJECT SUMMARY:
Uterine leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare but clinically aggressive uterine cancer arising from the smooth
muscle of the uterus. Each year, it is estimated to occur in 6 out of every 1,000,000 women in the United States.
The average age at diagnosis is 51 and women with uterine leiomyosarcomas have a poor prognosis. Current
therapies for uterine leiomyosarcoma are not very effective and the primary treatment of uterine leiomyosarcoma
are surgery. Due to the intrinsic rarity of this disease, prospective randomized clinical trials examining the
outcome in individuals with uterine leiomyosarcoma is limited. Moreover, a poor understanding of the
pathogenesis of this disease is also a major knowledge gap to develop effective treatment strategies.
Thus, preclinical uterine leiomyosarcoma models that recapitulate the human disease is desperately needed to
support clinical trial readiness. Homozygous p53 mutations and homozygous Pten deletion have been observed
in approximately 61% and 19% human uterine leiomyosarcomas respectively, genetic mouse models
with p53 homozygous mutations and homozygous deletion of Pten will be genetically relevant to the human
disease. However, to generate homozygous p53 mutations with previously developed conditional Trp53 mutant
allele (such as LSL p53-R172H) in mice is not feasible. It is because, mice with homozygous LSL p53-R172H
allele are p53 null and will die of mainly lymphomas at 4-6 month of age. However, the Trp53wm-R172H and Trp53wm-
R245W alleles, recently developed at our Institute, express functional wild-type p53 even in mice with homozygous
genotype. Thus, these novel alleles allow homologous mutant p53 expression and Pten deletion to be generated
upon Amhr2-Cre-mediated recombination. Our preliminary data showed that mouse with
homozygous p53 mutation and homozygous deletion of Pten developed metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma
around 24 weeks of age. RNAseq and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that the gene expression
of uterine leiomyosarcoma from these mice is like that of human uterine leiomyosarcoma. Thus, we propose to
further understand the mechanism underlying the initiation and progression of uterine leiomyosarcoma using
these mouse models, which will lead to more rational drug development and testing. Since p53 mutation and
Pten deletion are also very common in other cancers, what we will learn from these mouse models will potentially
benefit the study of other cancer with heterozygous or homozygous p53 mutations for therapeutic development."

Plants convert sunlight into chemical energy, synthesizing hundreds of thousands of organic compounds from
carbon dioxide and minerals, and sustaining life on earth. Plants and photosynthetic bacteria shape our
environment and create the atmospheric oxygen we breathe, making life on earth possible. Thus, plants provide
humans with essential nutrients, medicines, shelter and energy. For millennia, humans have harvested and
utilized plants to produce foods, pharmaceuticals, and fuels. Human benefits from plants progressed from
foraging to intensive agriculture and currently derive from biotechnology and synthetic biology. Utilizing the
metabolic potential of photosynthetic organisms in an increasingly sustainable manner requires the expertise of
plant biologists, microbiologists, and biotechnologists. While biotechnology can address many of the challenges
currently threatening our well-being, maintaining or improving the health of a growing world population in the
face of a changing environment requires that plant and microbial scientists receive innovative and cross-
disciplinary training. The Plant Biotechnology for Health and Sustainability (PBHS) graduate training program
fosters the education, training, and professional development of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists
who will assume leadership positions in biotechnology-related careers including academia, industry,
entrepreneurship, and government. PBHS emphasizes a set of core competencies, including knowledge of a
broad set of technical domains, developing critical thinking and communication skills essential for effective
collaboration across disciplines. A training emphasis is placed on building specific skill sets designed to promote
personal and professional development.
Bachelor’s and master’s degree level trainees enter the PBHS program at the start of their third semester of
predoctoral training. During the second year of predoctoral work, trainees take specialized courses designed to
cover current concepts in plant and microbial biotechnology, computational research and bioinformatics, effective
management of collaborative efforts, and approaches for translation of basic research into commercial products.
The program will provide two years of support to six predoctoral students at a time. For the duration of their
predoctoral training, the fellows will continue to participate in program professional development activities,
including training in reproducible science, mentoring, and communication skills development. The program
includes support for students to participate in industrial internships as well as annual symposia and retreats
designed to build a student cohort, broaden the professional networks of trainees, and highlight cutting-edge

 The goal of this K99/R00 application is to support and facilitate the transition of Dr. Robert Jackson’s
mentored postdoctoral research project to an independent research program focused on spatiotemporal
modeling of cancer-causing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in human oral epithelia. HPVs are responsible
for 5% of all cancers worldwide. HPV causes genital cancers, but also an increasing number of oral cancers,
most often in the tonsils and caused by HPV16. In the United States, the rate of HPV-associated oral cancers
has surpassed cervical cancers and is considered an epidemic. HPV16 can transform host oral epithelial cells
and lead to oral cancer, most often arising in the tonsillar crypt, but its normal viral lifecycle is reliant on epithelial
differentiation to yield a productive infection. To address the oral health burden caused by HPV16, Dr. Jackson
proposes three specific aims to assess and characterize HPV16 transforming vs productive infections in oral
epithelia. Dr. Jackson’s preliminary work, using three-dimensional oral epithelial culture and single-cell
transcriptomics, demonstrates that tonsillar crypt and surface epithelial subtypes have unique differentiation
phenotypes and host regulator activity. In the K99 mentored phase, Dr. Jackson will assess HPV16’s lifecycle in
tonsil epithelial subtypes and test the hypothesis that a host transcription factor, Peroxisome Proliferator-
Activated Receptor Alpha (PPARα), regulates viral productivity and tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1, he will
quantify HPV16 lifecycle stages and tumourigenicity in tonsillar crypt and surface epithelia. In Specific Aim 2, he
will modulate PPARα activity to determine if it controls viral productivity and tumorigenicity. In the R00
independent phase, in Specific Aim 3, Dr. Jackson will establish his independent research program and define
the spatiotemporal viral-host transcriptome across oropharyngeal tissues. The proposed mentored research will
be performed at the University of Arizona, an ideal research and training environment, and will be coupled with
a career development plan including structured professional development and new techniques training. Dr.
Jackson will be supported by his primary mentor, Dr. Koenraad Van Doorslaer, as well as an advisory committee
that will ensure his successful transition to a tenure-track faculty position for the independent phase. Dr.
Jackson’s proposed research aligns with the NIDCR’s strategic priority to integrate oral and general health, with
an objective to advance prevention, early detection, and treatments for head and neck cancers using the tactic
of characterizing HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers. Dr. Jackson’s research is relevant as it intersects with notices
of special interest including single-cell level spatiotemporal mapping of oral tissue and incorporates
computational approaches."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
The catchment area of Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) is the 15-county region in Northeast 
Ohio surrounding the City of Cleveland with a census of 4 million individuals, in which about 80% of the cancer 
patients seen at consortium hospitals reside. Of note, within this 15-county region, 62% of all cancer patients 
are seen at a consortium hospital site. Over the past 5 years, Case CCC has impacted the catchment area and 
beyond with thoughtful community-engaged research and outreach programs. The Center has recognized 
poverty as an important root cause of cancer disparities, and assembled a team of investigators, local 
government, and the safety-net provider network to engage communities for interventions on poverty and 
cancer prevention, and early detection services. The overarching goals of the Community Outreach and 
Engagement component are to build capacity for 1) collaborative, community-focused cancer research of 
relevance to the catchment area, and 2) outreach programs to increase cancer awareness and knowledge, 
and effective patient navigation. Specific aims of the Community Outreach and Engagement component are to: 
 1. Implement population-based approaches to understand cancer burden in the catchment area and to 
 guide scientific inquiry on distinct cancer-related challenges. 
 2. Use knowledge of the distinct cancer issues in the catchment area to stimulate new scientific 
 discoveries, and disseminate findings into the population at large, including underserved communities. 
 3. Promote cancer disparities reduction and health equity through an inclusive research environment. 
The Case CCC is also addressing the high rates of lung cancer by strategically focusing on primary and 
tertiary prevention, including the implementation of a tobacco Quit Line eReferral system at the MetroHealth 
System, and providing data and testimony that were instrumental in passing the Tobacco 21 law in the city of 
Cleveland in 2015. Case CCC has established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to guide catchment area 
research, and recently established the Office of Cancer Disparities Research (OCDR) to support, coordinate, 
and foster interdisciplinary cancer disparities research, training, and outreach program evaluation. Collectively, 
this program seeks to demonstrate the Case CCC’s commitment to working together to enhance the discovery 
process, promote innovative and community-changing collaborations, educate and motivate the citizens of 
Northeast Ohio and beyond, and conduct research across the Center’s Research Programs of direct relevance 
to the catchment area."
10786051,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of head & neck cancer and the 10th most
frequent human malignancy worldwide. Over the last several decades, the overall survival rate of OSCC patients
has stagnated between 40~55% despite some progress in diagnosis and therapy. The invasive growth or
progression of OSCC relies on the aggressiveness of cancer cells and their unique microenvironment, whereby
cancer stem cells (CSCs) and infiltrated tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) play pivotal roles. Previous
studies have demonstrated that polyamines (PA) are commonly elevated in tumor microenvironment (TME) and
have long been proven to be necessary for transformation and progression of various types of cancers. eIF5A2,
an isoform of a highly conserved translational factor, is overexpressed in many types of cancer. Remarkably,
spermidine-mediated eIF5A hypusination (eIF5Ahpu) that is implemented by two highly specialized enzymes,
deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS/DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), appears to be essential to most,
if not all, of eIF5A’s biological functions, including its important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and CSC properties as well as immune cell functions, thus rationally
emerging as a potential target for both therapy and prevention of cancer. Our analysis of TCGA dataset indicated
an overall upregulation in the mRNA expression of eIF5A2 and several key enzymes involved in PA metabolism
in HNSCC, which was confirmed by Western blot and IHC studies. Our studies showed that blocking
DHPS/eIF5Ahpu remarkably inhibited proliferation and CSC properties of OSCC cells, which correlated a
downregulation of TWIST1-BMI1 expression and NOTCH1/HES1 signaling. Meanwhile, we found that blocking
DHPS/eIF5Ahpu robustly inhibited OSCC-induced polarization of M2-like TAMs and reversed the
immunosuppressive effects conferred by OSCC-induced TAMs on T cell activation in vitro. More Importantly,
we found that blocking DHPS/eIF5Ahpu dramatically retarded tumor growth and infiltration/polarization of M2-like
TAM in an orthotopic syngeneic mouse tongue SCC model. Based on these compelling preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that eIF5Ahpu might play a critical role in OSCC growth and progression due to its dual functions in
regulating proliferation/CSC properties of OSCC cells and OSCC-induced M2-like TAM polarization. To test our
hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1) Elucidate mechanism by which eIF5Ahpu regulates proliferation
and CSC properties in OSCC; 2) Determine whether eIF5Ahpu plays a critical role in OSCC-induced polarization
of M2-like TAMs; 3) Target eIF5Ahpu to suppress tumor growth and immunosuppressive TAMs in OSCC in vivo.
New findings from this application might not only shed light on elucidating the function of eIF5Ahpu activation in
development and progression of OSCC, but also hold promises for identifying novel therapeutic targets for
treatment and prevention of OSCC."
10848376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
When making a decision we can use our understanding of available action-outcome relationships to prospectively
evaluate the consequences of our potential actions and choose the one that is currently most beneficial. This goal-
directed strategy is, thus, quite flexible, allowing us to readily adapt our behavior when circumstances change. But
we don’t always think about the consequences of our behavior. Usually this is fine. Such habits are a way for our
brain to efficiently execute routine behaviors. A balance between goal-directed and habitual control allows behavior
to be adaptive when needed, but efficient when appropriate. But disrupted goal-directed learning and overreliance
on habit can cause inadequate consideration of consequences, inflexibility, a lower threshold for compulsivity, and
disrupted decision making. This can contribute to aspects of numerous diseases, including substance use disorder
(SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, obesity, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism. An obstacle to
mechanistic understanding is the dearth of information on the neuronal circuits that support action-outcome and
habit learning. Thus, our broad goal is to expose neuronal pathways regulating both forms of learning.
 Midbrain dopamine neurons have long been implicated in learning. Canonically, they have been thought to
signal the reward prediction errors that support habit learning. But emerging evidence indicates that midbrain
dopamine has a much broader role in learning than originally thought, including contributions to goal-directed
learning. How can dopamine support both these, often opposing, forms of learning? Our solution is simple:
dopamine’s different functions in learning are achieved through its different projections. We will reveal the pathways
that enable dopamine function in both habit formation and action-outcome learning.
 Dopamine may mediate action-outcome and habit learning via projections to the amygdala. The basolateral
amygdala (BLA) is critical for action-outcome learning. By contrast, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)
mediates habit learning. Midbrain dopamine projections to the BLA and CeA have long been known to exist, but
little is known of their function. We will reveal a function for each pathway in instrumental learning here. Our working
hypothesis is that midbrain dopamine projections to the BLA support action-outcome learning and dopamine
projections to the CeA support habit learning. We will test this hypothesis in two aims using a suite of modern
systems neuroscience tools including fluorescent sensor-based dopamine monitoring and cell-type and pathway-
specific, bidirectional, optogenetic manipulation coupled with theory-driven behavioral assessment of action-
outcome and habit learning with outcome-specific devaluation and omission contingency tests. This will provide a
critical basic science foundation for our long-term goal of mechanistic understanding of the causes of disrupted
decision making and maladaptive habits in pathological states."

Tissue specific regeneration requires the function of progenitor cells that can differentiate to repair diseased or
injured tissues. Affected tissues can contain stem cells and their growth and patterning are controlled by
transcription factors and signaling pathways. Stem cells derived from stem cell niches contribute to the
regeneration of mature tissue types in many different organs, including the trachea, lungs and teeth, amongst
others. These niches are formed in developing embryos, and must be maintained throughout life by symmetric
cellular divisions that produce daughter pluripotent stem cells. Another equally important behavior of the cells
in a stem cell niche is the production of differentiated daughter cells by asymmetric cell division, which then
take the place of damaged cells in regenerative organs, in order to allow the organ to continue to function.
However, the roles of specific microRNAs (miRs) in these processes are unclear. miRs have become
appreciated as playing a role in stem cell differentiation. The ability to coopt miR expression in order to
reprogram and control the differentiation of naive cells into different cell types will be an important tool required
to create artificial organs and repair diseased tissues, saving millions of lives and public dollars.
We hypothesize that miR-26b is acting in part to regulate the stem cell niche of the lower and upper incisor by
regulating Lef-1 expression, and that this mechanism may be common to many tissues that house stem cell
niches. Thus, the absence of miR-26b expression prior to E14.5 allows Lef-1 expression in the oral
epithelium (placode) and LaCL (stem cell niche) during development. However, after E14.5, miR-26b
expression in the dental epithelium restricts Lef-1 expression and then other factors (Sox2) regulate stem cell
maintenance. In order to determine how Lef-1 and miR-26b is affecting gene expression during development
and cells we will pursue three aims: 1) to use our murine models to understand in vivo stem cell proliferation
and differentiation by Lef-1 and miR-26b OE; and use miR-26b OE to rescue the Lef-1 OE phenotype and
define the role of miR-26b OE in dental development; 2) validate molecular interactions between miR-26b, Lef-
1 and known factors involved in DESC proliferation and differentiation; 3) isolate the dental epithelial cells from
WT, Lef-1 OE, miR-26b OE and rescue mice to identify new genetic pathways using RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq. and
Single cell Seq."
10893994,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While lung transplantation is the only treatment option for end-stage lung disease, early post-operative
complications are common and limit long-term patient survival while concomitantly increasing the economic
burden of an already expensive therapy. Successful surgical outcomes can be defined by an ideal or “textbook
outcome” (TO) where the patient does not have significant early post-operative complications, which for lung
transplant can include primary graft dysfunction, acute lung allograft dysfunction, renal failure or infection. Our group
recently published the first lung transplant TO definition based on single-center data and found failure to achieve TO
was strongly associated with worse patient survival and significantly higher cost to the health system. A subsequent
registry analysis of 62 US lung transplant centers found the rate of achieving TO ranged from 27% to 72%,
emphasizing wide variability in outcomes and potential for intervention and improvement. The Lung Transplant
Clinical Center in this proposal include Duke University, University of Louisville, University of Minnesota and
University of Pennsylvania. These centers are four of the oldest and most respected lung transplant centers in
the country with geographic and size diversity, including small, medium, and large volumes. Our proposal aims
to understand the critical pretransplant clinical characteristics, as well as novel underlying biologic aging differences,
that contribute to worse early outcomes, or failure to achieve a TO. We hypothesize that specific clinical variables and
biological aging measures can predict early complications. Biological age in the pretransplant patient may be driven
by organ specific advanced lung disease and therefore ameliorated with lung transplant. Alternatively, biological age
may be a systemic process across organs systems and does not resolve with transplant. To determine the significance
of organ specific versus systemic aging, we will evaluate pretransplant biological aging in the recipient's pretransplant
immune system and explanted lung. Using iterative machine learning we will develop and validate a TO prediction
model based on the identified clinical variables and biological measurements to determine a personalized
perioperative risk of lung transplantation for individual candidates. More than just a predictive tool, this proposal will
allow for identification of potentially modifiable clinical and biologic variables that can be leveraged to improve
outcomes. As part of the larger Lung Transplant Consortium, we will enroll participants and contribute data and
biospecimens through a common research protocol under the auspices of the Lung Transplant Consortium Data
Coordinating Center and Steering Committee."

About 87 million new cases of gonorrhea occur worldwide annually. In 2020, 677,769 cases were reported to the CDC, a
111% increase in annual incidence since the historic low in 2009. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) has become resistant to
almost every antibiotic in clinical use. Reports of resistance to ceftriaxone – the only currently recommended first-line of
treatment – from almost every continent portends an era of untreatable gonorrhea. Development of novel treatments
and preventives against Ng is a global public health priority.
Our group, in collaboration with Evaxion Biotech, has identified two putative cell-division proteins (NGO0265 and
NGO1549 (FtsN)) as lead vaccine candidates. NGO0265 and FtsN are expressed by all Ng isolates and FtsN is essential for
bacterial viability. Immunization of mice with NGO0265 and FtsN elicits bactericidal antibodies (Abs) and significantly
reduces the duration and burden of gonococcal colonization of mouse vaginas. Ng deploy a unique immune evasion
strategy wherein it caps its lipooligosaccharide (LOS) with sialic acid using its surface LOS sialyltransferase (Lst) and host-
derived CMP-sialic acid. LOS sialylation enables Ng to evade complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and
down-regulate the inflammatory response by engaging host Siglec receptors. Gonococcal lst deletion mutants are
attenuated in mice. Supporting its key role in pathogenesis, all gonococcal disease isolates sequenced thus far possess a
functional Lst gene.
Camelid single-domain antibodies called VHHs or nanobodies, have been found to possess unique properties that offer
enormous versatility to facilitate the rapid development of simple and economical antibody-based therapeutics. VHH-
based products can exploit the small size and high stability of VHH components, their propensity to bind conformation-
dependent neutralizing epitopes, and their tractability for functional expression as heteromultimers. These characteristics
make possible commercially favorable antibody therapeutic agents having ultrahigh target affinities, broad natural variant
specificities and the ability to bind multiple different targets.
Here, we aim to develop nanobody-based therapeutics against NGO0265, FtsN and Lst for use as an adjunctive treatment
and as a preventive against multidrug-resistant gonorrhea. In Aim 1, we will immunize alpacas with purified recombinant
chimeric NGO0265-NGO1549 and Lst, create a nanobody-display phage library from immune B cells and identify
nanobodies that recognize non-overlapping epitopes on their targets with high-affinity. The ability of the nanobodies to
block enzyme function or to activate complement and kill Ng when linked to IgG Fc will be evaluated in Aim 2. In Aim 3,
we will test the ability of the lead anti-Ng nanobodies against each of the targets to clear gonococcal colonization in a
well-established mouse vaginal colonization model.
Successful completion of the work will identify and characterize nanobodies with activity against multidrug-resistant Ng,
which can then be adapted to a variety of formats and drug delivery platforms."
10928121,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) represents 60% of all epilepsy cases and involves the hippocampus resulting in
memory and cognitive deficits. Within the hippocampus is the dentate gyrus (DG), a selectivity filter which
generates unique representations of contextually similar inputs, a process known as pattern separation. Pattern
separation relies on the coordinated activation of multiple types of interneurons (INs) which, in TLE, are
susceptible to cell death and reorganize. Without proper inhibition, granule cells (GCs), the main projection
neuron, fire imprecisely leading to failure in pattern separation. Two important IN subtypes in the DG are the
parvalbumin (PV) INs, which modulates GC firing by delivering reliable perisomatic inhibition thus affecting output
signals, and the somatostatin (SOM) INs, which modulates incoming signals by synapsing onto the distal
dendrites. However, their individual contributions to pattern separation computation have yet to be determined.
Recently, the semilunar granule cells (SGCs), an excitatory neuron identified by their wide dendrites, has been
hypothesized to aid in maintaining suppression of the non-firing GCs. How SGCs and GCs differ in molecular
and connectivity profiles is currently unknown. Interestingly, SGCs have been shown to be the primary source
of perisomatic excitation onto PV-INs, potentially enhancing feedback inhibition onto local GCs. However, how
SGCs affect network activity and their contribution to pattern separation in TLE is unknown. I hypothesize that
SGCs will show reduced intrinsic pattern separation compared to GCs and that SGC driven PV-IN activity more
robustly supports pattern separation than feedback dendritic inhibition by SOM-INs. Furthermore, experimental
TLE will disrupt the precision of SGC to PV/SOM-IN mediated inhibition resulting in pattern separation deficits.
This proposal will investigate the unique connectome of SGCs and, using an ex vivo temporal pattern separation
paradigm as well as a in silico DG network model, to elucidate the contributions of PV-INs and SOM-INs to
pattern separation in SGCs and GCs in healthy and epileptic circuits. Together, identification of the local circuit
mechanisms underlying dentate pattern separation and how it is impaired during epileptogenesis will pave the
way for novel strategies to manage memory related co-morbidities in epilepsy."

With few exceptions, all organisms encode encodes 20 amino acid building blocks used in the synthesis of
proteins. The overall goal of the PI's research program is to develop interdisciplinary tools to reprogram the
genetic code to precisely probe and manipulate biological systems. Our ability to incorporate noncanonical amino
acids (ncAAs) with diverse physical, chemical, and biological properties into proteins of interest is central to the
reprogramming of genetic codes. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop cells able to biosynthesize and
utilize ncAAs and explore the utility of these unnatural organisms in the biosynthesis of bioactive drugs and in
vivo sensors for posttranslational modification enzymes. To achieve this goal, the first research goal is to identify
more ncAA biosynthetic pathways and use them for the generation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms with
additional amino acids. The additional amino acid can be biosynthesized without exogenous addition, followed
by the genetic incorporation of it into proteins using a bioorthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA
pair in a site-specific manner. The biosynthesis pathway of ncAAs will be obtained via metabolic engineering or
using bioinformatic strategies. The resulting organisms with 21st amino acids will be used to prepare bioactive
compounds with novel activities as well as the development of in vivo sensors for posttranslational modification
enzymes. To biosynthesize bioactive compounds with ncAAs, we will first introduce the bioorthogonal aaRS for
aminoacylation of tRNAs with the ncAA, and then engineer synthetases of natural products towards the tRNA
charged with the ncAA. The resulting natural product derivatives will exhibit enhanced biological activities or
unprecedented biophysiological properties. Next, we will explore the utility of these unnatural organisms with
additional protein building blocks for monitoring the activities of posttranslational modification enzymes in vivo.
The eukaryotic cells able to biosynthesize and utilize amino acids with posttranslational modification handles will
be used to produce caged luciferase or fluorescent proteins. The resulting engineered cells will allow for the
evaluation of posttranslational modification enzymes' activities in real-time, thus providing a strategy to guide the
treatment of epigenetic inhibitors in vivo. Our efforts in this project will yield a collection of organisms with a 21st
amino acid, and will result in new platforms for the evolution of ncAA-based therapeutic molecules or novel living
sensors."
10765447,"Project Summary
In both mitosis and meiosis, success depends on accurately pulling partner chromosomes away from one
another on a spindle composed of microtubules. The microtubules attach to the chromosomes at their
kinetochores. When the partners errantly move to the same pole a chromosome imbalance is created,
producing cells with too many or too few chromosomes (aneuploidy). Meiotic errors produce aneuploid
gametes, the major cause of birth defects and infertility, while aneuploidy in somatic cells is associated with
tumor progression. The goal of this project is to elucidate mechanisms that allow chromosomes to correctly
attach to microtubules so they segregate appropriately in meiosis and mitosis. Three concurrent projects will
address this goal. Experiments in Project 1 will elucidate the mechanisms used to partition chromosomes in
meiosis I. When cells enter meiosis, homologous chromosomes are not connected to each other, but they
become linked by crossovers (chiasma). These linkages help homologous chromosomes to move away from
each other in meiosis I. The linkages transmit tension between the homologous centromeres when they
become attached correctly to microtubules from opposite sides of the spindle. Tension stabilizes these
attachments. A second kind of connection called centromere pairing allows the centromeres of model
chromosomes to become linked. Project 1 will explore the basis by which centromeres become connected by
centromere pairing and determine how often natural chromosomes rely on centromere pairing to ensure they
segregate correctly at meiosis I. Project 2 will define the biophysical properties of connections made by
centromere pairing and chiasmata in transmitting tension between centromeres. Project 2 will also investigate
whether chiasmata in different chromosomal positions have different biophysical properties that explain their
different abilities to ensure proper segregation. A final project focuses more on mitosis. Cells with abnormally
high chromosome numbers, for example many tumor cell lines and polyploid cells, rely on high level
expression of the cell cycle kinase Mps1 for their survival. The same is true for meiotic cells. Mps1 plays many
roles, but this Mps1-addiction of certain vulnerable cell types appears linked to a role for Mps1 in attaching
chromosomes correctly to microtubules in mitosis and meiosis. The experiments in Project 3 will test the
hypothesis that Mps1 mediates a form of chromosome movement called chromosome gliding that might help
chromosomes move to favorable positions on prometaphase spindles. Finally, genetic screens in Mps1-
addicted mammalian and yeast cells will be used to identify the vulnerable Mps1 pathways. These projects will
be collaborative and synergistic and reveal unique insights into centromere behavior in meiosis and
chromosome microtubule interactions in mitosis. They will include emerging technologies in budding yeast and
collaborative efforts that exploit other model systems to advance our knowledge of chromosome biology."

The laboratory studies how genetic variation, sex differences, and environmental heterogeneity affect
phenotypic differences within and between species. Determining how genetic and environmental factors affect
phenotypes—and how those effects differ between sexes—is essential for understanding the mechanistic
basis of traits, including many human diseases. The laboratory’s current research has three primary areas of
focus: the genetic basis of sex-specific cellular, physiological, and behavioral variation; sex chromosomes and
sexually dimorphic gene expression; and the regulation of the immune response to bacterial infection. The
goals for the next five years involve determining the genetic mechanisms responsible for phenotypic variation
within and amongst genotypes, sexes, and environments. This research will address important gaps in our
understanding of why there is phenotypic variance within genotypes, and how that variation relates to
phenotypic differences across genotypes, sexes, and environments. The project will accomplish its goals by
combining experimental and genomic approaches across multiple species that are informative of general
principles because of their unique biological features or available genetic tools. Two of those species—house
fly (Musca domestica) and Drosophila pseudoobscura—harbor natural genetic variation that will be used to
determine how genotype, environment, and sex interact to affect phenotypes. A third species, Drosophila
melanogaster, is a powerful model organism with a rich suite of genetic and genomic resources that will be
used to determine the mechanistic basis of phenotypic variation. The project will use quantitative and
population genomic approaches in all three species to measure how genotype, environment, and sex
contribute phenotypic variation within and among individual organisms. Comparative and functional genomics
approaches across these species and their close relatives will also be used to identify genes and regulatory
networks that could underly phenotypic variation. Hypothesized mechanisms identified from the quantitative,
population, comparative, and functional genomics analyses will be tested using the powerful D. melanogaster
genetic toolkit. The laboratory is well-suited to perform this work because of its expertise using evolutionary
and functional genomics approaches to study phenotypic and genetic variation within and across species."

is still needed, meanwhile Veterans cope with long-term effects of impaired brain processing
and neurodegeneration. A better understanding is needed to address the problems caused by
TBI. Genetic predispositions to neuronal damage susceptibility versus predispositions to
neuroprotective resilience and repair represent a understudied gap in our understanding of
how to best treat the brain following a TBI. Moreover, as therapeutic approaches become more
personalized, a robust understanding of the contributions of genetic background to TBI
resilience and recovery is essential in order to develop solutions for our affected Veterans We
will identify genes that affect the degree of blast-induced functional impairment and post-injury
recovery by studying a set of model mouse strains that encompass most all of the genetic
variations between laboratory strains. The injury model will utilize a well-established blast tube
system designed to mimic pressure waves experienced during a field explosive detonation. A
battery of behavioral tests will be performed at baseline prior to the injury and as long as 30
days after blast exposure to assess the role of genetics in recovery of functional outcomes,
including different aspects of memory performance, anxiety, motor coordination, startle
reactivity, and nesting. We will also compare TBI-induced region specific changes in markers
of neurodegeneration and alterations in gene expression. We will also include examinations of
other organs for blast-induced damage to see if the genetic factors influence the affects upon
non-neuronal tissue. This research represents a multi-level examination of how certain genes
influence blast-induced TBI and recovery. It will provide essential starting points for future
investigations to understand how these genes play roles in the post-injury outcomes, to
develop optimal models for blast studies, and to lead towards the definition of therapeutic
targets that could be modulated to eventually improve the health of Veterans with histories of
blast exposures."

Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease and a major contributor to morbidity
and mortality. We have successfully performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and single
nucleus ATAC sequencing (snATACseq) on five healthy control and eight diabetic kidney samples to measure
the cell-type-specific transcriptional and chromatin conformational profile of early human diabetic kidney
disease. The differentially expressed transcripts in the diabetic proximal tubule showed upregulation of
gluconeogenic genes and enrichment of pathways involved in corticosteroid signaling. This proposal aims to
integrate snRNAseq and snATACseq to determine whether there are changes in chromatin accessibility in the
enhancer and promoter regions of corticosteroid-sensitive genes that regulate gluconeogenesis. We will
subsequently validate our in vivo findings with an in vitro model of diabetic injury and a diabetic mouse model.
This proposal builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training.
Currently, Dr. Parker Wilson is spending 25% of his time on the renal and molecular pathology clinical services
with the remaining 75% allocated to basic research in Dr. Benjamin Humphreys’ laboratory. Dr. Wilson has an
established mentoring relationship with Dr. Humphreys and has published his analysis of snRNAseq data from
human diabetic kidney as a first author in PNAS. In addition, Dr. Wilson has a recently-accepted co-first author
manuscript describing multimodal snRNAseq and snATACseq integration in the healthy adult kidney in Nature
Communications. These findings provide the foundation for this application, which will focus on expanding Dr.
Wilson’s scientific skills in single cell methods, bioinformatics analysis and models of diabetic kidney injury.
The career development goals will be achieved through mentoring by Dr. Humphreys and an advisory
committee with expertise in regulation of chromatin conformation, bioinformatics and diabetic nephropathy. Dr.
Wilson will undertake didactic coursework in research ethics, scientific communication and grant writing,
molecular biology and advanced computer programming to further his existing knowledgebase. The work will
take place at Washington University, which has a strong history of mentoring successful physician-scientists.
Completion of this career development award will build a solid foundation for Dr. Wilson as he pursues

Skeletal fragility and fracture risk are emergent co-morbidities in individuals with obesity. Poor fracture outcomes,
more apparent in obese subjects with diabetic complications, prolong disability and increase medical costs.
However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Bony callus formation is a ‘high-demand’ phase of fracture
repair that is reliant on Wnt signaling as well as increased protein synthesis, folding, and processing by the
osteogenic cells. The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) regulates cellular protein synthesis and facilitates
correct protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus aiding adaptation to environmental and/or
metabolic changes. ER stress and aberrant UPR, due to protein folding and processing overload, are pivotal
mediators of obesity related co-morbidities. Although ER stress has been linked to adverse skeletal outcomes
in some preclinical studies, the functional contribution of transcriptional and translational response arms of the
UPR in osteogenesis remain unresolved. We found compelling evidence that obesity augmented adiposity but
repressed transcription of the pro-osteogenic adaptive UPR targets, protein synthesis and viability of the callus
during the osteogenic phase of fracture repair. A faction of skeletal stem cells known as Cxcl12-abundant
reticular (CAR) cells, exhibited ‘translational arrest’ gene signature, a known pro-adipogenic attribute, despite
increase in their incidence with obesity. Notably, the chemical chaperone TUDCA, that modulates UPR by
improving protein folding, rescued the obesity-related osteo- to adipocytic skewing of the callus underscoring the
therapeutic potential of modulating this process in bone repair. In parallel studies we discovered that the UPR
sensor, IRE1, is the principal driver of adaptive UPR, promotes Wnt signaling, and bone formation in the
osteoblast lineage. In contrast, deletion of the UPR translational response regulator, PERK, suppressed
adipogenesis and stimulated adaptive UPR in osteoblastic cells. We therefore hypothesize that obesity impedes
skeletal repair by inhibiting IRE1 mediated osteogenesis and protracting PERK mediated translation arrest in
osteogenic progenitors. Studies in Aim 1 will determine if remediating adaptive IRE1 response, using genetic
and pharmacologic means, can restore Wnt-induced osteogenesis during skeletal repair of obese mice. Single-
cell profiling studies will be probe obesity-related changes in the ontogeny of bipotential osteoprogenitors.
Studies in Aim 2 will assess if chemically or genetically modifying PERK-regulated protein synthesis can restore
osteogenesis and viability of the callus. We will also determine if deleting PERK in preadipocytic subset of CAR
cells rescues their obesity-related translation arrest phenotype, callus adiposity and augments bone repair. We
will characterize the obesity-related translational reprogramming in Adipo-CAR cells and leverage -omics studies
in Aim 1 to discern mediators of crosstalk between PERK and adaptive IRE1 axes. Collectively, our studies will
uncover novel avenues of improving fracture healing in obesity."

A major unmet goal in pulmonary medicine is to distinguish pneumonia sub-phenotypes responsive to host-
directed therapies. We observe that some humans who died with pneumonia have abundant fibrin in their
airspaces while others show little or none, correlating with neutrophils and necrosis. Similarly, some mouse
models of pneumonia result in lungs with abundant airspace fibrin, while others do not; airspace fibrin
associates with both neutrophils and necrosis in these models as well. While fibrin in the airspaces is a
recognized pathological feature of pneumonia, this heterogeneity is not. Because fibrin can be pro-
inflammatory and neutrophils can enhance fibrin accumulation, we propose the central hypothesis that fibrin
and neutrophils in the airspaces form a positive feedback loop that causes damage in a subset of pneumonias.
We will test this by pursuing three independent but mutually informative specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether fibrin in the airspaces drives neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation and adverse outcomes,
during high-fibrin pneumonia. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interrupt key endogenous
drivers or inhibitors of fibrin accumulation (tissue factor, thrombin, or plasmin), we will test whether loss or gain
of fibrin decreases or increases, respectively, neutrophils and adverse outcomes like necrosis and lung injury
during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin type of pneumonia in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
neutrophils amplify fibrin accumulation in the airspaces, during high-fibrin pneumonia. We will use gene-
targeted mice to test whether CD11b and neutrophil elastase are each essential for airspace fibrin
accumulation during the high-fibrin but not low-fibrin sub-phenotype of pneumonia. We will also test whether
pharmacologically reducing fibrin or elastase activity when pneumonia is already underway can sever the
proposed positive feedback loop and improve outcomes during the high-fibrin pneumonia in mice. In Aim 3, we
will determine whether high-fibrin pneumonias involve distinctive lung transcriptomes that include a pro-fibrin
signature in airspace cells. We will profile lung transcriptomes of humans who died with high-fibrin vs. low-fibrin
pneumonia, to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. In mouse models, we will compare lung
transcriptomes over the time-course of lethal high- and low-fibrin pneumonias, to reveal dynamics of changes
as well as consistencies or differences between the human subjects and mouse models. From mouse lungs,
airspace cells (alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils) will be sorted from high- and low-fibrin
pneumonias to identify cell-specific transcriptome differences between these pneumonia sub-phenotypes. The
proposed studies will help elucidate the mechanisms and significance of high fibrin accumulation in the
airspaces of infected lungs. Results will be informative for whether and which subsets of pneumonia patients
may respond favorably to host-directed therapies targeting fibrin (like anticoagulants and fibrinolytics) and/or
neutrophils (like CD11b blockade or elastase inhibitors)."
10778746,"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play a critical role in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.
During disease, a small subset of SMCs proliferate extensively, undergo cell fate change(s) and migrate into
the lesion in a process termed phenotypic modulation. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we
have shown that this cell state transition is a continuum in which these SMCs first assume a fibroblast-like
phenotype and ultimately transition to a calcific phenotype. We have also shown that top CAD-associated
genes modify disease risk by altering the process of SMC phenotypic modulation. Our subsequent preliminary
scRNAseq data suggest that different modulated SMC phenotypes might arise as the result of discrete cell fate
decisions resulting in different transcriptional paths during disease. This suggests that causal CAD genes
function by altering the clonal proliferation and/or cell fate determination of SMCs during disease, but these
processes cannot be directly observed with traditional scRNAseq approaches. We have recently shown that
the transcription factor TWIST1 is the causal gene at 7p22.1, a genomic locus in human GWAS that is
associated with multiple vascular diseases including CAD, stroke, peripheral artery disease and Moyamoya
disease. Our preliminary data show that SMC-specific Twist1 knockdown: i) decreases lesion size in the ApoE-
/- atherosclerotic mouse model, consistent with the directionality predicted by human GWAS, ii) results in a
>60% reduction in the number of SMC-derived cells within the lesion and iii) specifically results in depletion of
the calcific modulated SMC phenotype in scRNAseq data. In addition, siTwist1 knockdown in human coronary
artery SMCs (HCASMCs) reveals a strong reduction in cellular proliferation/viability and migration. Taken
together, these data lead to our central hypothesis that the 7p22.1 locus acts through TWIST1 to drive vascular
disease risk by promoting SMC proliferation and altering cell fate decisions during phenotypic modulation,
which will be explored through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use a novel scRNAseq-compatible cell
barcoding mouse model to track individual SMCs as they proliferate and undergo cell fate determination during
atherosclerosis, with and without Twist1 knockout. In Aim 2, we will use a SMC-specific myc-tagged Twist1
overexpression mouse model to simulate the human risk allele, and determine whether increased Twist1
expression in SMCs is sufficient to worsen atherosclerosis. We will also leverage the expression of myc-Twist1
to query genome-wide Twist1 DNA binding in SMCs, identifying the direct molecular targets of Twist1 in vivo
during atherosclerosis. Aim 3 will determine the cellular pathways and transcription factors that act on the
causal SNP at 7p21.1 to regulate TWIST1 expression. Completion of these studies will result in a detailed map
of the SMC proliferation and lineage determination landscape during atherosclerosis, which will be a major
resource for the field. We will determine how Twist1 alters this landscape, and elucidate the detailed molecular
mechanisms of how 7p21.1 and TWIST1 affects the risk for multiple vascular diseases in humans."

10779769,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) risk is primarily of genetic origins with an estimated heritability of 80% but
non-heritable factors are also important in understanding the underlying etiology. One source through which
environmental effects may be influential is preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks gestation) which constitutes
10% of all births in the US. The etiology of preterm birth is primarily of environmental origin, usually due to
disease in the pregnant woman or her fetus. The processes underlying preterm birth may initiate the
development of ASD. This hypothesis has not been previously studied, and if true the heritability of ASD
may be lower in children born preterm, and before the optimal gestational age for delivery at week 39 to 40,
suggesting that children born preterm define a subset of the general population where environmental risk
plays a larger role for ASD risk.
The goal of this project is to examine the etiology of ASD in children born preterm and to determine if the
etiology is different compared to term-born children, and across gestational age; to identify risk factors for ASD
in PTB children, compared to term born, and to estimate the public health consequences of these risk factors,
how much can be attributed to confounding factors instead of the risk factors per se and if there are differences
in genetic architecture.
To achieve this goal, we will create a prospective cohort of all children born in Sweden and Finland 1996 to
2020 followed for clinical diagnosis of ASD, and link information from Swedish and Finnish National registers
until the end of 2024. We will replicate analyses in a sample from California and examine genetic markers in
two large genetic databases for ASD research.
In Aim 1 we will determine the epidemiology of ASD in children born preterm, and characterize the risk factors
for these children. Aim 2 will estimate population measures of risk (heritability and proportion susceptible) and
estimate public health consequences of the risk factors from aim 1 by calculating the proportion attributable
fractions for the risk factors. Aim 3 will replicate the analyses in aim 1&2 in a similar database from California.
Aim 4 will test if the genetic architecture of ASD differs in preterm and term-born children.

10781243,"The overall goal of this project is to produce drug-like small molecule agonists of the MAS1 receptor with suitable
brain exposure to better understand the role of this orphan GPCR in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as post-
traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). There is a paucity of high-quality probes of MAS1 that can enable successful
in vivo pharmacological studies to elucidate the role of this protein in the central nervous system (CNS). Studies
from several groups using transgenic animals indicate deletion of this receptor produces a pro-anxiogenic
phenotype. These studies point to a possible role of MAS1 agonists in resolving mental diseases associated with
heightened response to aversive stimuli such PTSD. We developed an HTS assay for MAS1 and conducted a
screening campaign using a diversity set of 30,000 compounds. Three different scaffolds were identified, of which
one particular pyrazole scaffold has many advantageous properties that can enable rapid development of CNS-
penetrant high-quality MAS1 probes with good drug-like properties. Through early SAR studies, congeners of
this scaffold have been identified that are more potent than commonly utilized small molecule activators of MAS1.
Three aims are proposed for this project: Aim 1. Synthesis and Optimization of the lead scaffold RU-70. A series
of pyrazole analogs are proposed to further improve potency, CNS exposure, and limit metabolism.
Computational approaches such as docking, and pharmacophore mapping will augment the design flow. Aim 2.
Pharmacological and ADMET characterization of MAS1 ligands. We will use MAS1 functional assays to rank-
order novel ligands. A suite of ADMET studies will identify leads that have good drug-like in vitro properties.
Suitable compounds will advance to rodent pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to establish their in vivo suitability for
efficacy testing. Further de-risking will involve off-target profiling of mature leads as appropriate. Aim 3 Determine
in vivo efficacy of novel MAS1 ligands on behavior and neural activity. We will determine whether innate or
learned responses to aversive stimuli and associated calcium dynamics in the dentate gyrus are altered by MAS1
activation through our novel MAS1 ligands. These studies will provide a clear indication of whether
pharmacological activation of MAS1 in the CNS can potentially provide a therapeutic opportunity for PTSD and
other psychiatric disorders. Successful completion of this innovative project can lead to the development of a
first in class therapy that has the potential to help many patients across the world."
10778696,"Project Abstract
Critical limb threatening ischemia (CLTI), the end stage of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), is diagnosed in
500,000 patients each year, often results in amputation, and has a ~50% 5-year mortality rate. Diabetic CLTI
patients experience especially high morbidity and mortality, and no effective non-surgical therapy exists for this
population. Data from our Phase II MOBILE trial demonstrated that autologous bone marrow nucleated cells
(ABMNC) were refractory in preventing amputations in diabetic patients. Thus, a more effective cell preparation
is needed to successfully treat diabetic CLTI. Recent data from our Phase I CHAMP trial shows that allogeneic
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMD-MSC) are more robust than ABMNC for stimulating
angiogenesis in ischemic muscle, specifically in diabetics. Our long-term goal is to develop a next generation
cell-based regenerative therapy to improve muscle function and prevent amputations in diabetic patients.
Preliminary data from a polygenic diabetic mouse model of CLTI indicate that human BMD-MSC stimulate limb
perfusion as well as promoting muscle function and regeneration. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest
that alginate hydrogel-encapsulated MSC, including a novel vertebral bone adherent (vBA) MSC, are
significantly superior to unassociated MSC for tissue regeneration presumably due to protection from host
immune clearance and production of an exosome profile associated with angio- and myogenesis. Based on
preliminary data and published studies, our central hypothesis is that allogeneic encapsulated vBA-MSC will
promote limb perfusion and muscle regeneration to the greatest extent possible, and thus ameliorate diabetic
limb ischemia to a greater degree than conventional allogeneic or autologous MSC. We will test the central
hypothesis by addressing the following two specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the optimal hydrogel type, MSC
preparation, dose, and route of injection for limb perfusion and muscle regeneration using polygenic diabetic
and diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse models of CLTI. Studies will compare human allogeneic BMD-MSC to a
vBA-MSC preparation in both unassociated and alginate hydrogel encapsulated forms. Aim 2. Determine the
molecular mechanisms of encapsulated MSC-mediated ischemic muscle regeneration. The working hypothesis
is that phenotypic alterations induced by alginate encapsulation will result in upregulating expression of MSC
molecules, such as IL-10 and IL-33, that stimulate Treg function and promote the M1 to M2-biased
macrophage phenotype switch which in turn stimulates muscle regeneration via progenitor cell function. This
aim will utilize gain and loss of function of cytokine production to determine the role of MSC-stimulated muscle
regeneration. The successful completion of this study will identify the most effective preparation of MSC and
determine primary mechanisms by which exogenous MSC mediate muscle regeneration in diabetics.
Identifying the impact of MSC on the molecular pathways regulating muscle regeneration will allow
development of alternative non-cell-based therapies to treat diabetic CLTI patients."
10908672,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The host range, or tropism, of pathogen virulence factors is a key determinant of infection. A
detailed understanding of host and pathogen mutations that control species tropism is required in
order to assess the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks, improve animal infection models, and
design new therapeutics that take advantage of host specificity.
 The objective of this proposal is to define barriers to cross-species activity in bacterial
virulence factors at high resolution, leveraging staphylococcal exfoliative toxins as a study system.
Exfoliative toxins encoded by pathogenic bacteria in the genus Staphylococcus cause life-
threatening skin diseases including staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and bullous impetigo
characterized by widespread blistering and damage to the epidermis. Exfoliative toxins are
proteases that act by selectively cleaving the skin desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1, leading to
loss of epidermal barrier function and blister formation. Our central hypothesis is that virulence
factor activity is dependent on genetic compatibilities between hosts and pathogens, and that
interrogating these compatibilities will uncover specific barriers to host tropism. In preliminary work,
we found that genes encoding desmoglein-1 have undergone rapid evolution and repeated natural
selection across non-human primates within a small protein surface sufficient to restrict toxin activity.
We have also developed tractable in vitro assays to measure toxin cleavage of recombinant
desmglein-1 from various host species.
 The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) generate a high-resolution map of mutations in
desmoglein-1 that restrict toxin tropism, and 2) test how toxin mutations at the desmoglein-1 binding
interface contribute to host tropism. In Aim 1 we will perform combinatorial mutagenesis of the toxin
recognition surface in desmoglein-1 to produce a genetic map defining the barriers of host
recognition. In Aim 2 we will apply structural and biochemical approaches to resolve the desmoglein-
exfoliative toxin binding interface combined with genetics to assess how toxin mutations at this
surface control host tropism. Collectively this proposal will establish a framework to define genetic
barriers to bacterial infections at high-resolution, applied towards the goal of anticipating and
preventing future disease outbreaks."

Opportunistic fungal infection of immune-compromised individuals is an escalating world health problem,
recently highlighted in a report from the World Health Organization. Lethal outbreaks of multi drug-resistant
Candida auris in hospitals and the rise of drug resistance in normally benign commensal fungal species like
Candida glabrata highlight the severity of the problem. Even severe COVID-19 cases facilitate secondary
infection by fungal pathogens like Aspergillus and Candida that can be lethal. Current treatment options for
fungal infections are limited to a few antifungal drug classes that are becoming increasingly ineffective. There
is a pressing need for new molecular targets for antifungal development to deal with drug-resistant pathogens.
Our central objective is to establish auxin-inducible degradation (AID) technology in Candida pathogens to
enable functional studies of virulence and drug resistance factors and as a tool to facilitate antifungal target
validation in the early stages of antifungal drug discovery. AID provides rapid and specific depletion of target
proteins of interest and has key advantages over other common methods for protein functional
characterization. In Aim 1 we will engineer molecular biology reagents and strains, and establish protocols, to
validate and implement a modified AID system in C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. auris. Our novel system
should be applicable in any strain, including clinical isolates, of Candida pathogen species. Validation
experiments will use novel virulence and drug resistance factors identified in our labs. In Aim 2 we will combine
AID technology in Candida species with two common animal infection models, Galleria mellonella (waxworm)
larvae and immunosuppressed mice, to create systems for early target validation and in vivo simulation of drug
effects on pathogenesis. These systems will also be applied to our novel candidate antifungal targets. AID is a
powerful functional genomics tool that will enable new research opportunities in fungal pathogens. Reagents
and protocols established during the project will be made available to the research community, and the work
will establish a blueprint for expanding AID use to other diverse fungal pathogens. Overall, this technological
platform will address the pressing need for identification and validation of viable new targets for antifungal
therapeutic development."

Prolonged sitting and inadequate moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) are pervasive risk
factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).1–6 CVD is the leading cause of death globally, prematurely taking
655,000 American lives annually.7 Recent research has shown that some benefits of moderate to vigorous
physical activity can be accrued in motivationally accessible, short, 2-5 minute bouts throughout the day rather
than needing to be a single, longer, continuous bout.8–13 Identifying an effective intervention to interrupt
prolonged sitting throughout the day with short, 2-5 minute bouts of MVPA, “exercise snacks,” can provide an
accessible way for adults with sedentary jobs to change two CVD risk factors. The current R34 proposes to
user-test and pilot the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical signal detection of a novel intervention, MOV’D, to
interrupt prolonged sitting with short bouts of MVPA, compared with a Fitbit-only control. Preliminary evidence
from an NHLBI K01-funded proof-of-concept study found that evidence-based behavior change technique
(BCT) texts to a private, social-media based support group increased steps throughout the day compared to a
Fitbit-only control group, but the effects did not last. MOV’D significantly adds to this initial work by: adding
videos teaching exercise snacks and BCTs to increase initial and maintained change; adding a peer-coach
feature to increase engagement; targeting exercise snacks instead of single exercise bouts; and targeting an
at-risk, understudied population (receptionists and clerical health care staff with CVD risk factors). Our team
partnered with upper management of Stanford clerical health care staff (low wage positions with high job
constraints on physical activity). Together, we have occupationally-tailored the MOV’D program. Before
conducting a fully-powered efficacy trial (ORBIT Phase III), we need to user-test and refine two intervention
components with our target population (ORBIT Phase Ib; Aim 1); and conduct the necessary acceptability,
feasibility, and clinical signal detection pilot trial (ORBIT Phase IIb; Aim 2), which will obtain recruitment and
retention parameters to inform the Phase III trial. The Aim 1 user-testing of both the exercise snack and BCT
videos will be done with participants from the target population to ensure learning effectiveness,
appropriateness, and acceptability. The Aim 2 pilot will randomly assign n=60 participants from the target
population to either MOV’D or a Fitbit-only control for 6-weeks, with a 6-month follow-up. We will compare
immediate and 6-month data to a priori benchmarks for acceptability, feasibility, and clinical signal detection in
workday prolonged sitting bout length and workday MVPA minutes. Results from the proposed R34 will directly
inform the R01 for the Phase III trial of MOV’D to test efficacy and duration of effects. The long-term objective
is to have a scalable, widely-accessible, remotely-delivered, low-cost behavioral intervention to decrease CVD
risk, and is easily adaptable to different populations. Additionally, we will have a library of vetted exercise
snack and BCT videos and a guide for occupational-tailoring and adapting videos for researchers in this space."

Enterobacterales are increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics, making them a global epidemic public health
threat. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL Ent) infections were historically
limited to healthcare settings, but over the past two decades there have been significant increases in infections
occurring in otherwise healthy children and adults without prior healthcare contact. These community-acquired
(CA) ESBL Ent strains are epidemiologically and genetically distinct from healthcare-acquired strains, yet
similarly associated with severe infections, high costs, long hospital stays, subsequent nosocomial spread, and
poor outcomes. Importantly, ESBL Ent have been recovered from the healthcare environment and linked to
transmission events in humans, yet the contribution of the household environment to community-acquired human
infection is unknown. We recently discovered surprisingly that in children, ESBL Ent infections were 4-34x more
likely to be community-acquired than were infections with susceptible strains. This seeming paradox highlights
critical gaps in knowledge of transmission dynamics, reservoirs and sources of antibiotic resistance genes
(ARGs) in CA-ESBL Ent. Such information is needed to inform strategies to interrupt community transmission.
 The proposed studies will yield important new knowledge about community-based exposures to resistant
bacteria by examining carriage in healthy persons and potential household environmental sources. The proposal
has two aims: 1) In households of healthy children, measure the prevalence and molecular ecology of ESBL Ent
environmental contamination; and 2) Measure the prevalence of ESBL Ent colonization in healthy individuals
within households and explore individual level epidemiological factors associated with carriage of ESBL Ent. A
comprehensive culture- and molecular based characterization of bacteria and ARGs within human and
environmental samples will assess household reservoirs that may facilitate transmission of resistant strain types.
 The community is now an important and expanding reservoir for the spread of virulent ESBL Ent strains into
hospitals, posing new challenges to clinicians and infection prevention specialists. To effectively mitigate the
spread of ESBL Ent strains in both healthcare and community settings, we must first understand the prevalence
in healthy community-dwelling individuals, identify factors associated with ESBL Ent colonization, and determine
the significance of environmental surface contamination in the spread of these pathogens. The knowledge
gained through the proposed investigations can inform novel infection prevention strategies for decreasing the
burden of ESBL Ent in the community. Investigations such as ours that lead to preventive advances will benefit
a large number of patients and have a positive impact on healthcare utilization and expenditures. This research
will characterize key household ESBL Ent reservoirs and yield valuable insight into potential routes of ARG
acquisition and transmission pathways, informing subsequent investigations and targeted interventions."

 Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a fundamental physiological parameter reflecting cerebrovascular integrity
and brain function. Regional CBF alterations are well documented in Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias (ADRD) and can contribute to ADRD prognosis, diagnosis, and differentiation. Arterial Spin Labeled
(ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only non-invasive method for imaging regional CBF
and has been increasingly adopted in multi-site clinical ADRD research. However, ASL signals are prone to
artifact from physiological noise and other nonidealities. Additionally, while multi-site ASL data can provide the
statistical power needed to assess regional CBF changes in the ADRD continuum, they are often acquired with
different ASL protocols from different scanner vendors and software versions leading to bias and variance in
site specific CBF values. Both factors can obscure biological effects of interest, even in large datasets. The
purpose of this R21/R33 study is to develop an ASL research framework for multisite clinical research studies
aimed at I) developing automated indices to rate the quality of CBF maps that can be used reproducibly in
place of more subjective visual inspection for quality control (QC) as well as for identifying the likely source of
artifacts, and II) harmonizing multisite ASL data to remove site effects. The R21 phase will focus on method
prototyping and validations using ASL data from a single vendor platform. Expert ratings for quality of ASL CBF
maps and predetermined features of CBF maps will be used to train a deep learning (DL) algorithm that can
automatically generate a quality index. The DL algorithm will be validated using synthetic data and expert
reading results as well as cross-validations. Another DL algorithm will be used to identify the probable source
of artifacts in input CBF maps. Prototype harmonization will be based on approaches previously used for
structural MRI, but with ASL specific modifications involving mathematical manipulations to preserve more
biological effects and to avoid under-harmonization. The R33 phase will substantially expand the methods
developed in the R21 phase to be generalizable to multiple vendor platforms. A data driven DL network, as
opposed to predetermined features used in the R21 phase, will provide both a composite and a voxel-wise
quality index for the input ASL CBF images; the latter allowing regional CBF data to be retained instead of
discarding the whole volume. We will also expand the capability of harmonization to cover data from unseen
scanners. Finally, we will demonstrate the benefit of these methods in ADRD research by testing hypothesis
that use of these research strategies will increase sensitivity for differentiating patients with mild cognitive
impairment from cognitively normal older subjects. This novel project leverages our decades of expertise in
ASL technologies and ASL-based ADRD research and our access to multi-site ASL data. We have provided
substantial pilot data to show feasibility of the proposed work. The resulting research infrastructure will be
disseminated freely for research use using Github and our open-source software toolkit ASLtbx."

Heparin is the most widely prescribed anticoagulant drug in the world and is used routinely for the treatment and
prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Currently, therapeutic heparin is a fractionated
form of heparan sulfate derived from animal sources, predominantly from connective tissue mast cells in pig
mucosa sourced from China. While essential and widely used, heparin has significant adverse complications.
Approximately 600,000 patients per year treated with heparin in the USA develop a life-threatening condition
known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which results from the formation of heparin-platelet factor 4
(PF4) immunoreactive complexes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for safer, alternative sources of heparin.
A recombinant source of heparin would be safer, avoid supply chain issues, and allow for the introduction of
biological modifications to prevent HIT. While the enzymes involved in heparin biosynthesis are identical to those
for heparan sulfate, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanisms that give rise
to the anticoagulant activity and biosynthesis of heparin. Heparin inhibits coagulation by binding with high affinity
to the serine protease inhibitor, antithrombin (AT), and enhancing its activity to neutralize thrombin and Factor
Xa in the coagulation cascade. Additionally, heparin exhibits high affinity binding to PF4, a chemokine produced
by platelets, triggering HIT. Since PF4 binding to heparin depends on distinct binding sites compared to AT, we
hypothesize that cells could be engineered to produce anticoagulant heparan sulfate with decreased PF4 affinity
as a safer alternative to animal-derived heparin. Our previous studies have revealed distinct regulatory
mechanisms for heparin biosynthesis in cells, suggesting that other factors exist that regulate anticoagulant
heparin/HS production and modify AT and PF4 affinity. The goal of this proposal is to leverage our experience
in genome-wide screening assays to identify genetic factors that control heparin biosynthesis and can be utilized
for bioengineering anticoagulant heparan sulfate in cultured cells. To accomplish this goal, we aim to (i) adapt
genome-wide screening assays to search for novel factors that regulate AT and PF4 binding to cell surface
heparan sulfate, and (ii) validate prioritized hits from the screens and leverage these for metabolic engineering
of mammalian cells to produce anticoagulant heparan sulfate with lowered PF4 affinity. The successful
completion of these aims will provide a bioengineered cell line that produces a safer, recombinant form of heparin
and may also uncover previously unknown genes associated with heparin’s activity and assembly. Importantly,
this project will lead to future detailed hypothesis-driven studies that will bring us closer to finding an alternative
to animal-derived heparin for improving patient care and clinical outcomes by prevention of HIT."

Numerous disease processes impair the regulation of vascular function, leading to abnormally high or low blood
pressure. While hypertension is considered as the most important risk factor for global burden of disease, severe
hypotension and vasodilatory shock are of major importance in critical illness. Morbidity and mortality of
vasodilatory shock remain unacceptably high and treatment strategies have not been improved since decades.
Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate vascular function is a prerequisite for the
development of improved treatment strategies for critically ill patients. Although dysfunction of a1-adrenergic
receptors (AR) is thought to constitute the hallmark in the development of vasodilatory shock, the molecular
mechanisms leading to impaired α1-AR function have been unknown. Similarly, information on the regulation of
other important G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate vasoconstrictor responses, such as arginine
vasopressin receptor (AVPR) 1A or angiotensin II receptor 1, during the cardiovascular stress response and the
development of vascular dysfunction in critically ill patients has not been available.
The main goal of the PI’s research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate vascular
function during the cardiovascular stress response and to identify new therapeutic approaches to stabilize
vascular function in critically ill patients. The PI’s laboratory discovered that chemokines and their receptors
regulate vascular GPCRs that mediate the effects of key stress hormones, i.e. catecholamines/α1-ARs and
arginine vasopressin/AVPR1A, and identified hetero-oligomerization between chemokine receptors (CRs) and
vasopressor receptors as a molecular mechanism underlying their cross-talk. In this MIRA application, we
propose to build upon our recent progress in the field and to address critical knowledge gaps regarding the
prevalence, assembly and molecular signaling properties of hetero-oligomeric complexes between CRs and
vasopressor receptors, and to elucidate their relevance in health and disease processes. We will focus primarily
on the roles of CRs in the regulation of vasopressor function, but also plan to expand studies on the roles of
vasopressor receptors in the regulation of CR function. We propose a multi-faceted and translationally relevant
approach, spanning from state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques to analyze receptor heteromer formation
and function at the molecular and cellular level to in vivo animal models and analyses of the function of freshly
isolated vascular smooth muscle cells and intact resistance arteries from animals and patients. We believe that
this project has the potential to establish a new paradigm in the understanding of the regulation of vascular
smooth muscle function in health and disease and is likely to identify new molecular targets to modulate vascular
function and blood pressure regulation in various disease processes."

Adoptive cell transfer using tumor-specific T cells is a promising option for cancer treatment and the most
powerful tumor-killing effector T cells are CD8+ type-1 cytotoxic T cells (Tc1). We have shown that IL-9-
secreting CD8+ Tc9 cells mediate stronger and long-lasting antitumor effects in vivo compared to the classical
IFN-γ-secreting Tc1. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that,
when we rechallenged Pmel-1 Tc9- or Tc1-treated mice on the contralateral flank with gp100-knockout (KO)
B16 tumor cells, these cells rapidly grew and established tumors in Tc1 but not Tc9-treated mice. Similarly,
relapsed gp100– B16 cells recovered from Pmel-1 Tc1-treated mice rapidly grew and established tumors after
re-implanting to Pmel-1 Tc1- but not Tc9-treated mice, suggesting that Tc9- but not Tc1-treated mice develop a
host immunity against other (than the cognate) antigens expressed by relapsed tumors. Importantly,
significantly larger numbers of CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells were detected in late-stage tumors, rechallenged
tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) of Tc9-treated mice compared to Tc1-treated mice. These
CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of IFNγ and granzyme-B and effectively killed wild-type B16, gp100–
relapsed and gp100-KO B16 tumor cells. Hence, these novel findings strongly indicate that adoptively
transferred Tc9 but not Tc1 cells effectively induce a host CD4+ T cell response against relapsed tumors. To
determine the mechanism underlying Tc9 cell-induced host CD4+ T cell response, we performed preliminary
studies to examine immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME). We observed that dendritic cells (DCs)
were enriched in Tc9-treated primary tumors, rechallenged tumors, and TDLNs. More importantly, Tc9 cells
secreted a high level of IL-24, and Tc9-treated tumor supernatants contained abundant IL-24. As our
preliminary studies showed that IL-24 attracted DC migration in vitro, we speculate that Tc9 cells induce a host
CD4+ T cell response through IL-24-DC circuit. We hypothesize that tumor-specific Tc9 cells may be a superb
T-cell subset for cancer immunotherapy due to their capacity to elicit a host CD4+ T cell response to suppress
the growth of relapsed tumors. To test our hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine the role and importance of Tc9 cell-
induced host CD4+ T cell responses in recognizing and eliminating relapsed tumor cells, and Aim 2 will
determine the role and mechanism of IL-24-DC circuit in TME and TDLNs in eliciting tumor-specific CD4+ T cell
responses and preventing the recurrence of tumors. Completing this project will uncover a novel mechanism of
Tc9 cells in mediating long-lasting antitumor activity in TME by inducing host CD4+ T cells to recognize tumor-
associated antigens or neoantigens via IL-24-DC circuit and suppressing or preventing tumor recurrence in
Tc9-treated mice."

The goal of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Postbaccalaureate Research Education
Program (PREP) is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students in the
biomedical sciences by preparing trainees for matriculation into highly competitive and rigorous
Ph.D. graduate programs and future success in science-related fields. CSHL PREP will provide
world-class research experience, professional development, and development of scientific
identity and community to its participants. Funding is requested for four PREP Scholars to
conduct a year of research in cancer and molecular biology, neuroscience, genetics and
genomics, quantitative biology, and plant biology, under the mentorship of a CSHL PREP
faculty member. Scholars will create an individual development plan that defines their research
interests, identifies relevant coursework, and establishes goals and timelines for their time in the
program and their future careers. They will participate in the Skills Development course,
designed exclusively for them, that includes writing and oral presentation workshops, and
guidance in preparing for graduate school applications. They will also attend the PREP
Bootcamp course to broaden their knowledge base in the biosciences. Scholars will have
numerous opportunities to develop their scientific identity and community. They will participate
in campus-wide seminars, meetings and journal clubs with their research laboratories, national
conferences, and the graduate student run Graduate Seminar Series. They will benefit from
having a Research Mentor, a Direct Mentor (a graduate student or postdoc in their research
laboratories) and a Near-Peer Mentor (a graduate student). These mentors will play an active
role in integrating the Scholars into the CSHL community, and help them build a scientific
network, such as with the approximately 12,000 scientists that visit CSHL annually to attend the
Meetings and Courses program. The PREP Committee will have oversight of CSHL PREP. The
committee will meet monthly with the Scholars at PREP Teas, and with the Scholar and their
Research Mentor in quarterly Progress Meetings. Moreover, the Program Director and Program
Coordinator will have Check-In meetings with individual Scholars monthly. Effectiveness of
CSHL PREP will be evaluated internally by CSHL’s School administrators and externally by
Barone Research Services through a combination of survey results, confidential reports by
Research Mentors, and exit interviews."

The underlying metabolic mechanisms leading to these conditions remain largely unknown. The parent study for this proposal, R01DK116033, focuses on the role and metabolic fates of fructose in the liver, which historically was considered the main tissue handling fructose. This proposal takes into account our preliminary data supporting a major role of non-hepatic tissues as sites of fructose metabolism, and of apolipoprotein clearance factors influencing postprandial lipid profiles. We address three questions related to non-hepatic fructose metabolism using high- and low-fructose meals in pre-diabetic and control subjects enrolled in the parent trial. Our first question regards the role of the small intestine in fructose metabolism; specifically the conversion of fructose to fat by de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and the composition of apolipoproteins in chylomicrons (CM), namely apoCIII, and apoB, and their relative contribution to postprandial hyperlipidemia. We developed an immunoaffinity method to isolate CM that transport the fat packaged in the small intestine. This will allow us to quantify, for the first time, intestinal DNL and the apolipoprotein composition of CM without contamination from fat made in the liver and transported by very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Our second question addresses the amount of fructose that escapes intestinal and hepatic metabolism and appears in the circulation, thereby becoming available to other tissues. For this aim, we will use a recently published dual stable isotope method to measure plasma fructose levels. Additionally, this method will allow us to explore, for the first time, intestinal gluconeogenesis in humans. For our third question, we will measure how much fructose is used as fuel by determining the amount of fructose that is completely oxidized to produce labeled 13CO2. Recent studies have suggested that oxidation is another major route of fructose metabolism. The administration of oral and intravenous stable isotopes in 18 pre-diabetic and 18 control subjects enrolled in the parent trial and the application of a technique to fractionate TRL allows for the quantification of CM and VLDL apolipoproteins and intestinal- and hepatic- DNL, along with measurements of fructose in the peripheral circulation, estimation of intestinal gluconeogenesis, and fructose oxidation. By measuring DNL, clearance factors, circulating fructose, and fructose oxidation in conjunction with the measurements of the parent study (hepatic gluconeogenesis, TRL-DNL and glycogen storage), we will have a more complete characterization of fructose metabolism and answer longstanding questions regarding the fates of fructose in two distinct populations. Importantly, we will demonstrate how extra-hepatic fructose metabolism contributes to T2D and CVD risk."
10765717,"Project Summary
 Anatomical atlases are spatial reference maps of cells in tissues/organs/brains and provide structure
information for a wide range of biological analyses. The anatomical atlas of C. elegans nervous system is the
only atlas for the entire nervous system of an animal with a resolution of all neuronal classes. However, built on
a limited dataset and manual annotations, the standard atlas is insufficient in capturing biological variabilities,
inaccurate and difficult to use for cell identification routinely, and only applicable for wildtype adult. While several
heroic efforts of generating and imaging marker strains to build atlases have much improved the atlases, there
is still a need for a pipeline to build accurate genetic-background-specific (or experimental-condition-specific)
atlases easily and cheaply; further, there is a need to build such atlases that can be used without specialized
equipment and with as few genetic perturbations as possible. Recent development of machine learning
techniques and molecular transgenic approaches enabling the systematic production of in vivo reporters and
imaging methods capable of collecting and processing high-resolution datasets at a large scale. The goal of this
application is to address the current bottleneck by establishing a combined experimental and computational
pipeline for modularly built, complete, coordinate- and template-free brain atlases for democratized and
flexible uses. By imaging in vivo markers in a large number of live animals, the project will generate complete
anatomical atlases for the C. elegans nervous system that capture variability in the population, which will greatly
enhance the accuracy of identity predictions when used on each animal. The project will generate a collection of
transgenic animals expressing partly overlapping in vivo markers that cover all neurons and build a
computational pipeline to assemble the atlases. Further, a few widely applicable developmental atlases as a
direct output of the project will showcase the pipeline and the approach. Importantly, the atlases do not seek to
provide a set of rigid coordinates for each neuron class, but instead, a set of constraints that can be used to
provide best estimates of neuron identities for each new sample. This ensures accuracy and applicability
of the atlases to specific use case. The building of whole-brain atlases is piece-wise from easily-obtained partial
atlases, and can be crowd-sourced if desired. The use will be streamlined with image input and neuron-identity
prediction output. The proposed project is innovative, because it will build the first complete anatomical atlases
of a nervous system using large datasets collected from in vivo markers of many live animals; it uses relational
information uniquely suited to provide more accurate assignments; it will capture variabilities among individual
animals. The proposed the work is significant, because it will address the urgent and unmet need for accurate,
easy-to-use and easily updatable atlases to curate the brain; further, it will develop and establish conceptual
framework and techniques for similar efforts in more complex anatomical systems."
10765644,"Project Summary/Abstract
The main obstacle to curing HIV-1 infection is a reservoir that consists of resting memory CD4 T cells whose genomes
contain inducible and replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses. Decay of the reservoir is slow and requires lifelong
antiretroviral therapy (ART). It has become increasingly clear that the predominant mechanism sustaining HIV-1 persistence
during ART is the physiologic proliferation of latent-infected memory CD4 T cells. Infected CD4 T cells can proliferate
without producing virus, the result of which will lead to daughter cells harboring expanded HIV-1 proviral clones that share
identical sequence and host integration sites. The rate of expansion among distinct proviral clones in this setting however is
not equal. In some individuals, upwards of 30% of proviruses sampled can belong to populations that are highly clonally
expanded, a mechanism consistent with clonal proliferation by antigen encounter. Establishing a link between particular
antigens and the degree to which they independently contribute to HIV persistence, however, is an unresolved question.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a latent betaherpesvirus that while asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, persistently
stimulates the memory T cell pool. Persons living with HIV are near universally coinfected with CMV. In this project, we
have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators to directly assess the degree to which chronic antigenic stimulation
by CMV (i) promotes proliferation of the memory CD4 T cell pool (ii) contributes to clonal diversity and size of the HIV-
1 reservoir during ART and (iii) impacts the time to viral recrudescence when ART is interrupted. Specifically, we will
utilize the well-established model of ART-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques to examine these questions by a dual
approach. The first will exploit availability of pathogen-free, rhesus CMV (RhCMV)-naïve rhesus macaques (RMs) to
compare SIV reservoir dynamics in the presence or absence of CMV. The second will assess measures of SIV persistence
when CMV replication is blocked pharmacologically with antiviral Cidofovir. Critical to our aims are that we will
interrogate SIV proviral DNA at multiple longitudinal timepoints, in multiple tissues, and with several assays that inform
both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the SIV reservoir. We believe that the comprehensive, highly synergistic, and
rigorously controlled studies we propose will (i) identify an immunodominant target that promotes turnover of memory
CD4 T cells during ART and by extension, persistence of the HIV-1 reservoir and (ii) provide a rationale to employ recent
well-tolerated FDA-approved CMV antivirals as a means to accelerate HIV-1 clearance."

While COVID-19 continues to be a health challenge, very little is known about how COVID-19 affects people
living with HIV (PLHIV). Based on the most recent reports originating from CDC and WHO, however, it appears
that people with HIV may have a 30% greater likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 disease when infected
with SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage the established rhesus macaque models of SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting
in COVID-19 and SIV infection to characterize the effects of underlying SIV infection on the manifestation of both
acute and post-acute COVID-19 sequelae. Our group was amongst few that established the rhesus macaque
models of COVID-19 infection early on during the pandemic. Our model has been utilized to both study the
immunological mechanisms of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for accelerated development of
vaccine and therapeutics against COVID-19. Here we propose to couple this model with the long-standing, highly
validated, pathogenic AIDS NHP model in SIV infected rhesus macaques to study a central hypothesis that
underlying SIV infection and the resulting immunodeficiency/immune activation promotes the progression of a
more severe COVID-19 presentation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. As corollary, we hypothesize that ART does
not completely suppress the ill effects of chronic immune activation due to SIV, it will not completely prevent the
progression of severe COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the macaque model. We have the experience
in infecting rhesus macaques with SIV and treating these animals with ART to suppress viral replication and
study immune mechanisms. By profiling the differences in dynamics of viral titers, induced tissue pathology, and
underlying immunological perturbations, we will provide definitive knowledge in whether SIV infected rhesus
macaques exhibit higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19. Furthermore, our studies will also be able to hint at
the specific mechanisms which result in this susceptibility. Delineating these comorbid immunological factors
driving susceptibility will enable better clinical monitoring and informed decisions for patient care. Mechanistic
insights developed by this study is also imperative for the development of host-directed immunotherapeutic
interventions for combating COVID-19 in PLHIV."
10932963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-23-009 to establish
a high-priority research network exploring potential mechanisms and novel technologies in music-based
intervention (MBI) and pain research. Pain is a multidimensional experience that leads to significant personal
and societal costs. Pharmacological, surgical treatments, and anesthesia pain procedures provide some relief;
however, they each have significant risks and do not address the psychosocial, behavioral, and/or
neurophysiological factors influencing chronic pain conditions. As such, adults are turning to non-
pharmacological, lower risk methods to manage pain –include integrative therapies such as MBIs. Meta-
analytic results suggest the effectiveness of MBIs is highly variable, with tentative clinical importance. Two
issues are especially relevant to the current state of MBI science: 1) it is unclear how researchers decide which
components to include in MBIs to address the biopsychosocial nature of pain, and 2) the reliance on subjective
measures that lack psychometric rigor and that are overly sensitive to extraneous psychosocial factors. MBI
research has not followed the traditional development pathway, but focused on effectiveness trials, omitting
essential development and optimization studies. A framework linking psychosocial, behavioral, and/or
neurophysiological, in parallel with the development and testing of technologies to complementing patient-
reported outcomes, will provide the foundation for rigorous, prospective trials. This U24 network will assemble
cross disciplinary group of scientists to significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
music’s capacity to alleviate pain, and to develop novel technologies to complement patient-reported
outcomes. The network will consist of scientists and clinicians from a broad range of fields including music
therapy, psychology, engineering, neuroscience, social work, and medicine. The core investigative team will
solicit participation of additional scientists through professional and scientific organizations and academic
consortiums. The network will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To address major gaps in our
understanding of the biopsychosocial mechanisms, including biomarkers, of MBIs in chronic pain. Aim 2:
Explore novel technologies and methods to enhance the objective, unobtrusive measurement of pain within the
context of music experiences. Aim 3 Implement a pilot program to fund pilot intervention studies specifically
focusing on the mechanisms and technologies to advance music-based pain research. The network will
establish cross disciplinary teams and bring new investigators into this field to bridge gaps in basic, applied,
and clinical research, disseminate a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms and
measurement of pain within MBIs, and establish preliminary datasets for use in grant applications. In these
ways, the network will dramatically accelerate programs focused on the optimization of MBI research."

Component A: BD-STEPS Core at the NC Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention
Birth defects are a leading cause of infant mortality and childhood morbidity, yet the etiology of most cases is
unknown. Established in 2002 with funding from the CDC, the North Carolina Center for Birth Defects
Research and Prevention (NCCBDRP) has been a major contributor to the National Birth Defects Prevention
Study (NBDPS) and Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS). The next phase of
BD-STEPS will continue to build on these important multi-site, population-based case-control studies to identify
novel epidemiologic and genetic risk factors for major structural birth defects that can be translated into
prevention strategies. The NCCBDRP's Specific Aims are to (1) Implement the BD-STEPS Core protocol in
North Carolina including: (a) Utilize the existing state-wide, population-based birth defects surveillance system
in NC to actively ascertain at least 150 cases per year among livebirths, stillbirths and elective abortions with a
study-eligible birth defect in the demographically diverse 33-county study area; (b) Utilize birth certificates to
identify an eligible population-based sample of approximately 100 control infants per year born in the same
study area; (c) Conduct clinical case review and classification by clinical geneticist and pediatric cardiologist
using abstracted medical records; (d) Partner with CDC's central interviewing contractor to facilitate NC
participation in the core interview and online occupational survey; (e) Conduct supplemental data collection
about reportable infections before and during pregnancy; (f) Conduct supplemental biospecimen collection of
residual newborn blood spots; (2) Establish a unique data resource for investigating prescription medication
use during pregnancy and birth defects by linking BD-STEPS and NBDPS participants in NC with health
insurance claims records from NC Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield NC; (3) Establish a unique
biospecimen resource for investigating prenatal environmental exposures and birth defects by collecting shed
deciduous teeth from BD-STEPS and NBDPS participants in NC; (4) Leverage the NCCBDRP's well-
established group of investigators and collaborators to develop innovative, high-impact studies with BD-STEPS
and NBDPS data on genetics, epigenetics, and gene-exposure interactions associated with birth defects, and
epidemiologic risk factors for birth defects including medication use during pregnancy, maternal chronic and
infectious disease, and key social determinants of health such as individual- and neighborhood-level
socioeconomic factors, acculturation, employment and workplace conditions, and environmental factors; (5)
Produce at least seven NC-led manuscripts for publication in high-impact journals using pooled data from BD-
STEPS and/or NBDPS during the 3.5-year award period; and (6) Continue our long-standing, successful
training program in birth defects epidemiology."

 Water is one of the three major constituents of dental hard tissues, but the structure of water and how
water interacts with other components in dental hard tissues during teeth formation, degradation, and lesion
remain unclear. Nuclear magnetic spectrometry (NMR) and infrared absorption (IR) are the methods that can
directly probe water from biological tissues. However, their performances are limited because NMR only
measures the average effect of the sample, while IR requires special preparations to tissues like teeth and could
alter the properties of the tissues. Recently, we demonstrated that fluorescence compressed Raman spectroscopy
has the capability of probing water in dental hard tissues and showed that the spectral profiles of water are
dramatically different between dentin and enamel. The profiles varied even within enamel at different testing
spots. Those results indicate that Raman spectroscopy may provide additional information about the role of
water in dental hard tissues with details that may impact the understanding of the mechanisms of dental
problems. The major aim of the proposed project is to use Raman spectroscopy to identify how the
changes in water content and structure in dental hard tissues may correlate with dental tissue
pathologies. Aim 1 will determine the best available Raman spectroscopy configurations for
probing water contents in dental hard tissues. Three common fluorescence suppression approaches, i.e.,
near-infrared excitation combining InGaAs detector, UV resonance Raman, and time-gated Raman spectroscopy
will be compared to determine how the signal to noise ratio of the water-related Raman signals can be
maximumly enhanced. We expect to increase the system sensitivity by one order or more. Aim 2 will
investigate the changes in water amount and structure changes reflected by Raman spectroscopy
and identify if these changes are correlated with other chemical/physical changes in dental hard
tissues. Teeth with various degrees of demineralization and decomposing of organics will be prepared to show
deferent levels of chemical compositional changes. Raman spectra will be acquired from these simulated samples
and used as references for probing compositional variations in teeth with naturally developed caries. Raman
spectroscopy will also be combined with micro-mechanical testing to identify correlations between water
contents and structure change and mechanical property changes."

 Traumatic events are common. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common
disorders resulting from trauma, tending to co-occur with increased alcohol consumption (i.e., alcohol quantity
x frequency [AQF]) and AUD. Much of this research on the comorbidity of PTSD and alcohol phenotypes has
focused on PTSD-AUD. As increased consumption of alcohol is associated with AUD, research is needed to
determine whether the same etiologic processes underlying PTSD-AUD comorbidity are those underlying
PTSD and AQF. Although the pathways by which shared risk for these phenotypes unfolds is unclear,
longitudinal and experimental research suggests effects of distress tolerance (DT), the perceived ability to
withstand negative emotional states, and anxiety sensitivity (AS), cognitive appraisal of anxiety symptoms as
having harmful physical, mental, or social consequences, on PTSD and alcohol phenotypes. Additionally,
genetic influences on PTSD and AQF/AUD may underlie risk for DT and AS. Thus, the goals of this K01
application are threefold: First, the proposed study will use large-scale molecular data and employ cutting-edge
methods to investigate cross phenotype prediction between PTSD-AQF, and PTSD-AUD, and direction of
effect between PTSD and AQF/AUD. Second, this study proposes to investigate the associations between DT
and AS, and risk for PTSD, AUD, and comorbid PTSD-AUD. Finally, via an Exploratory Aim, it will examine
whether genetic risk for AQF, AUD, and PTSD are associated with DT and AS, and if socioeconomic status
and social support moderate these effects.
 To achieve these aims, the candidate will be assisted by her mentorship team in the completion of a
comprehensive training plan that maps onto these three goals. Specifically, this K01 application will allow the
candidate to receive training in cutting edge genetic methods (training goal 1), laboratory-based paradigms and
psychophysiological data (training goal 2), the psychiatric and social epidemiology of stress-related
phenotypes (training goal 3), and professional development (training goal 4). With the help of the
multidisciplinary mentorship team, this K01 award will allow the candidate to integrate large-scale genetic
association findings with laboratory-based self-report, behavioral, and psychophysiological measures, to
predict risk for PTSD-AQF/AUD co-occurrence for those of varying SES levels and varying social support. The
proposed study represents an important step forward in clarifying risk factors and mechanisms of this costly
co-occurrence. The environment where the candidate will be trained is ideal for the candidate's long-term goal
of understanding the etiology of co-occurring PTSD and alcohol phenotypes to improve prevention/intervention
programs. This goal is in line with key NIAAA's research priorities, involving identifying mechanisms underlying
AUD and co-occurring mental health problems while integrating genomic and non-genomic factors."
10786074,"As the population continues to age, the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(ADRD) is dramatically increasing, resulting in an urgent need to identify at-risk older adults. Effective early
identification will occur during the preclinical stages of disease, before the onset of clinically overt symptoms.
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) can represent a preclinical and early disease state that is easily captured in
clinical and research settings. SCD is driven by multiple pathological pathways, including AD,
neurodegeneration, and cerebral small vessel disease, all of which underlie clinical dementia. Neuropsychiatric
symptoms also contribute to SCD and represent early symptoms and a risk for dementia. Current SCD
assessment methods lack the specificity to tease apart the underlying etiology of SCD. Tool development has
focused on the content of the questions, rather than identifying questions that relate to specific underlying
contributors. Additionally, minimal investigation exists understanding the interplay of these mechanisms on the
presence of SCD. The majority of research has thus far focused on SCD in relation to a singular pathological
process. These approaches to assess definition and tool development limit the specificity of SCD. This study
will leverage legacy data from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project, a longitudinal study with a subset of
individuals who are cognitively unimpaired and have minimal SCD. To supplement this cohort with an
expanded range of SCD and neuropsychiatric symptoms, this proposal will enroll a prospective longitudinal
cohort of cognitively unimpaired older adults with a range of SCD. Participants will undergo detailed
assessments of cognition, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture to capture multiple clinical and pathological
markers. Leveraging this rich information, the study will shift how SCD items are selected and using feature
selection methods will identify questions that relate to each SCD contributor to create profiles that SCD.
Modifiers of these profiles will be examined, including age, sex, and concomitant pathologies. The delivery of
these novel SCD profiles will enhance the utility of this cost effective and easily measurable early disease
marker that can be easily implemented by clinicians and researchers."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to create a four-state Mid-South REACH Hub to accelerate real-world
impact of biomedical innovations through education, mentorship, and financial support for aspiring
entrepreneurs. This Hub is critically needed, as much of the region is not supported by any REACH Hub, and
our consortium dramatically extends REACH, both geographically and demographically, to a network of
hundreds of community colleges and minority-serving institutions who currently encounter disproportionate
challenges in accessing federal support for innovation and entrepreneurship.
The significance of this endeavor is twofold: we will turn many more academic discoveries into real-world
products that save lives and improve human health, and we will catalyze a medical innovation economy in states
that have a robust innovation pipeline but limited resources to translate these discoveries into a knowledge-
based biomedical technology industry. Leveraging more than $2M per year in committed state and
institutional matching funds, Mid-South REACH will exponentially expand the impact of the REACH program.
Innovation in our Hub comes from a radically democratic approach to ensure equitable decision making, the
ability to reach a large network of underrepresented/underserved institutions across four states, and the new
flexible, scalable, and sustainable Hub model we propose in which many states and universities contribute
matching funds that are then used to fund innovators within their own constituencies. This model makes it easy
to add new partners; each can be confident that their money will stay in their local area, enhancing sustainability.
Our approach is to extend excellent education, proactive mentoring, and financial support throughout a diverse
coalition of states and universities across the Mid-South, combining Vanderbilt’s expertise in entrepreneurial
education with the collective experience of our partner institutions in supporting biomedical innovation. Our Hub
will be led by a diverse and experienced Multi-PI leadership team with PIs in each state who bring unique
perspectives, extensive networks, and outstanding experience in innovation, entrepreneurship, and medical
research to the team. Together, we will recruit an exceptional and diverse External Review Board, with funding
decisions made democratically by the board and the PIs. We will experientially educate our teams via proactive
mentoring that begins from the earliest moment of the pre-proposal stage and continues throughout their
projects, encouraging them to focus on product-market fit and to “fail fast” by identifying and working toward the
critical six-month technical and educational milestones that would justify subsequent funding tranches.
Ultimately, the payoff of this process in terms of startups founded, job creation, and economic impact will motivate
institutions and state governments to continue providing funding and in-kind administrative support, making the
Mid South Hub self-sustaining and multiply NIH’s initial seed investment manyfold into the future."
10786084,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Retinal circuitry is one of the most promising research platforms in the nervous system where mysteries of neural
network function can be unraveled, because individual neuronal circuits therein can be selectively activated by
specific natural stimuli, light. Moreover, all vertebrate retinas have similar neuronal and synaptic organizations,
and thus knowledge learned from one species can be applied to others, including humans whose neural network
dysfunction in disease states manifests. While significant progress has been made in understanding cell types
and signal spreading within retinal circuits, we still do not have a comprehensive picture of cell type taxonomy in
the retina and their wiring principles, slowing the progress toward a circuit-level mechanistic understanding of
how the retina processes visual information. For example, due to the limitation of existing single- or dual-
recording techniques, it is difficult to study synaptic connectivity between distinct cell types in the retinal circuit.
In addition, as sensitivity and waveform of various cell types change with levels of light adaptation and duration
of retinal isolation, single-electrode recordings in different retinas and/or under different adaptation conditions
result in response variations and inconsistencies, confounding the functional classification of cell types in the
retina. In this application, we will adopt the newly available multi-patch recording system to overcome these
issues by recording simultaneous responses and synaptic connectivity of up to 8 retinal neurons. This approach
will help to integrate piecemeal experimental results from previous studies into a coherent framework
representing the network behavior of the vertebrate retina, which is not feasible with the existing single- or dual-
electrode recording techniques. There are 4 Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to study spatiotemporal properties of electric
signal spread in the coupled rod photoreceptor network and how HCN channels shape the network behavior.
Aim 2 is to compare light response amplitude, waveform, and kinetics of the six types of bipolar cells (BCs) or
three functional groups of ganglion cells (GCs) recorded simultaneously in the same dark-adapted retina, and
the effects of light adaptation on these responses. Aim 3 is to study profiles of synaptic connectivity between
rods at different retinal locations and various types of BCs, and the roles of horizontal cells (HCs) in the rod-HC-
cone feedback pathway. Aim 4 is to establish a comprehensive connectivity map between various types of BCs
and GCs, and contributions of individual BCs to the light responses of various types of GCs. Results obtained
will provide new insights into how coupled photoreceptor networks process visual signals, how adaptation
differentially alters light responses of various types of BCs and GCs, and how individual BCs mediate
photoreceptor-BC-GC parallel information channels and how multiple retinal neurons function together in
processing visual information. A comprehensive connectivity map for lateral synapses in the rod coupled network
and radial synapses between various types of BCs and GCs may mark the beginning of establishing a “functional
connectome” for the retina."

Despite notable success in EGFR-driven lung cancer, precision therapeutics have failed in EGFR-driven
gliomas, the most common and deadly primary brain tumors. Reasons for failure of EGFR therapies in this
clinical context include the lack of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the biology of EGFR-driven
gliomas, including intra-tumor heterogeneity, drugs specifically designed to target invasive brain tumor cells
located behind and intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), and adaptive drug resistance. Here we will develop
and molecularly credential novel, EGFR-driven human glioma models for use in preclinical development of
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based therapies. The foundation of the proposal comes from the
Furnari Lab, who developed a novel platform (iGBM) for engineering glioma models using CRISPR
genome editing and has established intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity as a symbiotic driver of
tumorigenesis. The Miller Lab has extensive experience in small molecule experimental therapeutics using
genetically engineered gliomas model and next-generation sequencing. He also used a novel chemical
proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry, to assess the glioma
kinome en masse and showed that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance
in glioma models. He is now at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where local collaborators have
extensive experience with biologically faithful human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The
O’Rourke Lab is a pioneer in development of sophisticated glioblastoma organoid (GBO) models that
faithfully recapitulate the biology of molecularly and cellularly heterogeneous human tumors. In this Multi-PI
project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To develop novel genetically
engineered human models driven by the most common EGFR extracellular domain mutations. We will then
biologically and molecularly credential these models against genetically-matched PDX and GBO using
genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and kinome proteomics, and therapeutically challenge them using
a panel of EGFR TKI, including one designed to specifically target invasive glioma cells behind the intact
BBB. (2) To credential heterogeneous EGFR mutant iGBM models via biological, molecular, and EGFR
TKI therapeutic profiling. We will thus develop human models with defined driver mutations that will be
useful adjuncts to PDX/GBO for preclinical drug development. Models will be used to develop future
rational combination therapies that combat drug resistance and enhance EGFR TKI efficacy. This work will
therefore help realize the unmet need of precision therapeutics in neuro-oncology."

Approximately 9 million patients with diabetes (DM) are hospitalized annually and over 30% of inpatients without
DM experience high glucose (HG) due to their acute illness. HG increases the risk of infectious and non-
infectious complications and death, hospital length of stay (LOS), utilization of hospital resources and overall
healthcare costs. While glucose control reduces these risks, controlling HG in the hospital is difficult due to
multiple barriers such as recognizing and proactively treating glucose abnormalities, and adequately ordering
insulin to treat HG in the hospital. Clinical decision support (CDS) is a system that uses computerized person-
specific data in the electronic medical record (EMR) proven to improve hospital care. Among the various
modalities, alert-CDS is shown to improve care delivery, providers’ proactivity, and glucose control specifically
in intensive care settings of academic institutions. However, alert-CDS has not yet been studied outside of
intensive care units (ICU), or in community hospitals where most patients receive care. Furthermore, its impact
on patients’ outcomes has not been tested in any setting. The proposed project uses an innovative alert-CDS
tool we developed and validated which automatically identifies dysglycemia and inadequacies in insulin
administration in the hospital. It alerts clinicians with recommendations to support decision making without
superseding their clinical judgement. In our pilot study, we found that this alert-CDS tool reduced recurrent high
glucose levels and shortened LOS. Based on this promising preliminary data, in this project we propose to study
the impact of our CDS tool on clinical, economic and providers’ performance outcomes among non-intensive
care patients both in an academic and a community hospital. We propose to make this resource available
intermittently in the EMR every 3 months during 36 months, thus allowing us to compare 18 months of
intervention and 18 months of standard care. Based on our pilot study, we expect that a sample size of 12,560
subjects will give us an 80% power of detecting 0.34 days (~ 8 hours) difference in length of stay, the primary
endpoint of our study. We propose the following aims: Aim 1) To determine the impact of the alert-CDS over
conventional care on the clinical outcomes of non-ICU patients in an academic and a community hospital. Aim
2) To determine the impact of the alert-CDS over conventional care on the economic outcomes of non-ICU
patients in an academic and a community hospital. Aim 3) To determine the impact of alert-CDS for inpatient
glycemic control on providers’ perspectives, competencies and practice performance between an academic and
a community hospital. We hypothesize that the tool will increase providers’ knowledge about dysglycemia
allowing them to make better decisions about insulin administration. The anticipated success of our study builds
upon a well-established multidisciplinary team of investigators strongly supported by leadership stakeholders in
both hospitals. Our proposed study has the potential of establishing a new paradigm in the management of
dysglycemia in hospitalized patients with a major positive impact on clinical and economic outcomes."

Clear associations have been established between the food we eat and the development and progression of
colorectal cancer (CRC). For example, the consumption of fructose increases the risk for CRC development
and CRC-specific mortality. However, the mechanism underlying this association is unknown. We have shown
that moderate daily exposure to oral high fructose corn syrup (HFCS, a mix of fructose and glucose) leads to
larger and more aggressive intestinal adenomas in mice. These effects were absent in mice with genetic
deficiency of ketohexokinase (KHK), the enzyme that converts fructose to fructose 1-phosphate (F1P). A
metabolomic analysis of these tumors showed that F1P is highly abundant following HFCS exposure, and this
increase correlates with a reduction in pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that F1P, the
product of KHK, enhances tumor growth by acting as an allosteric inhibitor of PK to promote anabolic
metabolism and cell survival. We will test this hypothesis using mouse physiology and organ metabolism, cell
and human organoid culture, and recombinant protein biochemistry. In Aim 1, we will genetically and
pharmacologically manipulate the M2 isozyme of PK (PKM2) in mice to interrogate its role as a mediator of
HFCS-induced tumor growth. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanistic linkage between fructose exposure and
cancer cell survival. We have found that cells in culture do not grow faster when exposed to fructose, however
we observed a significant improvement in cell viability, especially under conditions of high cell density and
hypoxia with fructose in the media. Therefore, we hypothesize that F1P inhibits PKM2 to promote hypoxic cell
survival. We will test this hypothesis using cell and organoid culture models exposed to fructose and hypoxia.
We will genetically and pharmacologically manipulate KHK and PKM2 expression and activity in these models
to determine the specific effects of these proteins on cell metabolism and survival. In Aim 3, we will assess the
effects of F1P on recombinant PK isoforms with a particular focus on PKM2. We hypothesize that fructose-
derived F1P binds to and inhibits PKM2. We will perform biochemical activity and structural assays to
determine the kinetic parameters and oligomeric state of PK isoforms in the presence of F1P. These
experiments will reveal the molecular mechanisms of how F1P binds and inhibits PKM2. Together, these aims
will change our fundamental understanding of how fructose alters tumor cell metabolism, define the
fructose/F1P/PKM2 axis as a metabolic vulnerability of CRC, and provide pre-clinical evidence for PKM2
activators as a novel therapeutic modality to combat CRC."

10914275,"Herpes stromal keratitis (HSK) is a leading cause of infection-induced vision loss in the United States. The HSK
develops in response to corneal herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection. Recurrent corneal HSV-1 infection
can cause the persistence of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils, and effector CD4 T cells in
the corneal stroma of the infected cornea. As the accumulation of neutrophils and effector CD4 T cells in the
HSK cornea plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the tissue damage, the strategies to manipulate the stay of
infiltrating immune cells in the HSK cornea are anticipated to have an effect in reducing the HSK severity.
Chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, can play an important role in the retention of inflammatory cells in the
injured tissue. CXCR4 signaling is also reported to enhance hemangiogenesis in ischemic tissue. Our preliminary
results showed an increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 in HSV-1 infected cornea. We recently
standardized a protocol to separate an intact corneal epithelium (CE) and corneal stroma (CS) from uninfected
and HSV-1 infected cornea. Single-cell suspension prepared from individual CE and CS can be used for flow
cytometry. Using this strategy, we detected the presence of CXCR4-expressing cells in uninfected CE of
C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed that most CXCR4-expressing cells in CE of naïve cornea display the
phenotype of Langerhans cells (LCs) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Recently, monoamines have been
shown to engage CXCR4 on pDCs and inhibit IFN-a production. Histamine is a monoamine that is released
upon corneal HSV-1 infection. Experiments proposed in aim 1 will test the hypothesis that histamine released in
HSV-1 infected cornea engages CXCR4 on pDCs, and downplays IFN-a production from CE pDCs, increasing
viral load. Our results also showed that the number of LCs decreases in the CE but increases in the CS from 4-
day to 9-day post-infection (p.i.), suggesting a possible migration of these cells from CE to CS in HSV-1 infected
corneas. An increased expression of CXCL12 (CXCR4 ligand) was detected in CS than CE of the infected cornea
at 9-day p.i. Furthermore, most CD4+ T cells in the CS of infected cornea displayed effector (Ly6Chi) phenotype
at 9-day p.i. Experiments proposed in aim 1 will test the hypothesis that LCs-mediated restimulation of effector
CD4 T cells in the CS of the infected cornea is essential for their retention and effector function. Aim 1
experiments will also test whether LCs migrating out of CE and neutrophils infiltrating in the CE of HSV-1 infected
cornea impair corneal epithelial healing. In addition to corneal resident innate immune cells, our results also
detected the expression of CXCR4 on infiltrated neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells from newly formed
blood vessels in the CS of HSK cornea. Experiments proposed in aim 2 will test the hypotheses that blocking
CXCR4 signaling in HSK cornea will cause reverse migration of neutrophils and inhibit the development of
hemangiogenesis. The successful completion of the studies proposed in this application will underscore the
pleiotropic effects of CXCR4 signaling in HSK cornea and document it as a potential therapeutic target in HSK."

 Despite efforts to prevent suicide, US rates are climbing, and suicide is the second leading cause of death
amongst youth. Although promising approaches are available for preventative interventions with youth at-risk
for suicide, they demonstrate modest benefit, and recent reviews have concluded that new developments are
required that facilitate not only greater effectiveness, but also enhance treatment engagement, adherence, and
continuity of care amongst these young people. Digital tools, especially personal smartphones, are promising
avenues to address these issues and can be used to provide a unique understanding of proximal risk factors,
including psychological distress, anhedonia and behavioral withdrawal, and sleep disturbance amongst high-
risk individuals. Furthermore, digital methods can provide ongoing supportive patient contact to support the
reduction of suicide risk. The overall aim of this Fast-track SBIR proposal is to enhance the effectiveness of
selective and indicated prevention for youth who are received outpatient mental health care by developing and
testing a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate objective mobile sensing and
HIPAA compliant client communication tools into their management of these young people. We have
developed an initial MVP version of these products, and in Phase I will utilize user-centered design principles
to enhance the product fit with typical service delivery systems found in healthcare organizations working with
high-risk individuals (i.e., intensive outpatient services). The aim of Phase II is to further optimize these
products and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial of the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of the products
in a real world intensive outpatient clinical service. We will utilize the data generated by this trial to improve
adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustained use of these tools, guided by an implementation science
framework."
10840420,"SUMMARY: Role of Pre-existing Immunity on Airborne
Transmission of Influenza A Viruses
Influenza viruses pose a major public health threat through both seasonal epidemics and sporadic
pandemics. The epidemiological success of influenza viruses relies on its ability to spread
efficiently through the air and navigate three distinct spaces: 1) the donor, 2) the environment
and 3) the recipient (Lakdawala and Subbarao Nature Medicine 2012). The first infection with
influenza viruses leaves a long-lasting immunity, which can be evaded by the virus through
antigenic drift and shift. Our published data using the ferret model shows that pre-existing
immunity from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus infection protects recipient animals from airborne
transmission of a seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (Le Sage et al PLoS Pathogens 2021). We
hypothesize that pre-existing immunity can influence susceptibility to circulating influenza
strains independent of neutralizing antibody. To understand the role of pre-existing immunity in
protection against airborne transmission, Aim 1 will identify immunological and viral factors
underlying susceptibility to airborne transmission. Each influenza season, population-wide
immunity triggers viral antigenic evolution, Aim 2 will determine the impact of antigenic drift on
the susceptibility to influenza virus transmission. Aim 3 will examine the impact of different
vaccine platforms on susceptibility to drifted influenza virus strains. This proposal will provide a
better understanding of the immune protection needed to dampen influenza virus transmission
and inform effective universal vaccine strategies."

 This project will examine the effects of added Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits
on healthcare outcomes and disparities by race/ethnicity and disability. SNAP has been found to alleviate food
insecurity (albeit not fully), and is disproportionately utilized by racial/ethnic minorities and people with
disabilities, who have greater sensitivities to food insecurity (given “thinner margins of health” stemming from
exposures to other inequities). SNAP policy changes could therefore affect healthcare outcomes for
racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities in different ways than for their counterparts. Further, these
groups experience healthcare disparities (e.g., in disease prevention and management, unfavorable clinical
events, and expenditures) that are likely affected by food insecurity: individuals exposed to food insecurity miss
needed care and medications, use emergency and inpatient care, and require expenditures all at higher rates
than unexposed individuals, and effects are elevated among people with chronic conditions.
 We will use both national Medicaid data and a novel set of linked claims, public health, and administrative
SNAP data from Massachusetts to exploit a staggered set of natural experiments created by the Families First
Coronavirus Response Act: (i) April 2020: ~60% of SNAP households were given variable amounts of added
monthly benefits (up to over $1,000/month, with an average of $161/unit/month over the first year), (ii) May
2021: those with no/small boosts were given up to $95/month in added benefits, and (iii) since April 2021: 18
states have ended the new benefits, which will end for remaining states in March 2023. In MA, SNAP-linked
data will allow us to use these changes to model dose-responses and treatment removal precisely. T-MSIS
Medicaid data and state variability will broaden insights and improve the generalizability of our findings.
 As these SNAP changes occurred, multiple contemporaneous disruptions to healthcare, public health,
social welfare policies, and economic conditions were occurring as well. To address this issue, we will leverage
the significant heterogeneity in the geography and timing of the disruptions, in addition to the robust efforts that
have taken place during the pandemic to provide detailed, publically available data on these disruptions. We
will use confirmatory factor analysis, machine learning techniques, and an expert panel to guide our
understanding of and adjustment for these factors (Aim 1). We will then use growth curve models to measure
the effects of each SNAP change on healthcare outcomes (i.e., preventive use, unfavorable events, and
expenditures) (Aim 2) and on healthcare disparities based on race/ethnicity and disability status (Aim 3) in MA
and the US. Changes to SNAP’s funding and administration are routinely debated. This study will inform these
debates by offering rigorous, actionable evidence on the potential public health impact of these policy choices."

 Sulfation is the most abundant and diverse glycan modification which tunes the physical properties and
biological activity of residing glycans and glycoproteins. Other than sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),
sulfation is also commonly identified on N-glycans and O-glycans but is often overlooked. These glycans are
believed to play critical roles in many physiological/pathological processes and glycan-protein interactions, the
first example of which was the discovery of sulfated glycan ligand (on both N-glycans and O-glycans) for L-
selectin in lymphocyte homing and recruitment. Many Siglec-glycan ligand interactions are also found to be
“sulfation dependent” or enhance by sulfation. Nevertheless, current knowledge of the structures and functions
of these sulfated glycans is still limited, and mainly concluded from genetic studies and the use of simple sulfated
glycan determinants, which may not be complete or accurate as underlying structures significantly affect glycan-
protein interactions. Despite the significance, systematic synthesis of sulfated N-glycans and O-glycans has
never been achieved, which represents a major obstacle in understanding glycan sulfation. A major challenge is
the great diversity which is derived from multiple branches and cores of N-glycans and O-glycans, as well as
many potential locations of sulfate groups on them. The presence of keratan sulfate chains on N-glycans and O-
glycans further expands the sulfated glycan repository. To completely solve this problem, we propose to develop
a chemoenzymatic modular synthesis platform, by integrating sulfation modules into our current modular
synthesis platform for non-sulfated N-glycans and O-glycans. Mammalian sulfotransferases will be expressed,
fully characterized in terms of activity and acceptor specificity, and used to construct efficient sulfation modules.
Optimized sulfation modules will then be combined with glycosylation modules to synthesize sulfated structures.
The modular synthetic process will be well-programmed based on the substrate specificity of involved enzymes.
A comprehensive library (300+) of sulfated N-glycan, O-glycan, and keratan sulfates will be prepared to
showcase the powerfulness of the modular synthesis platform. Multiple chemical or enzymatic modulations will
be introduced to achieve regio- and branch-selective sulfation. The resulting compounds are important standards
for glycomics analysis and probes to understand the functions of sulfated glycans as well as many biological
processes. The modular synthesis process is programmable and can be readily adopted for automated synthesis."

 Variants in the tubulin folding cofactor D (TBCD) gene result in a rare early-onset encephalopathy with
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features including developmental regression, epilepsy,
microcephaly, hypotonia, and spasticity which progresses to immobilization, ventilation, and premature death.
TBCD functions as a tubulin-specific chaperone, which plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics
throughout neurodevelopment. Since first reported 7 years ago, modest progress has been made in
understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis and therapeutic
development. Our team has recently established and characterized the largest known cohort of induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from a phenotypic spectrum of 5 TBCD patients, from whom we gathered
corroborative clinical data. We show TBCD patient-derived cerebral organoids (COs) display a phenotypic
spectrum of profound growth deficits, microtubule instability, and early neurodegeneration, highlighting the value
of COs to recapitulate TBCD patient phenotypes. To compare the effect of different pathogenic variants on
clinical, molecular, and biochemical disease progression in vivo, we have generated a novel allelic series of
TBCD variant knock-in mouse models.
 We propose the central hypothesis that TBCD deficiency causes microtubule instability and cell-type
specific dysfunction during critical milestones of neurodevelopment, which include molecular deficits in
progenitor proliferation, migration, neuronal differentiation, and ultimately neurodegeneration. Through the use
of novel transgenic mouse and complementary organoid models, we will test this hypothesis and in parallel
establish a strong framework for developing a gene replacement therapy for patients with TBCD deficiency. In
Aim 1, we will determine neuropathological mechanisms of TBCD variants using patient derived COs including
through use of electrophysiology, single cell RNAseq, and CRISPR gene correction. In Aim 2, we will
comprehensively investigate the molecular and clinical phenotypes of a novel allelic series of TBCD variant
knock-in mouse models utilizing clinically relevant outcome measures such as CatWalk XT® gait analysis, MRI,
and EEG. In Aim 3, we will determine the therapeutic efficacy of targeted AAV-mediated gene replacement by
modulating the cell specificity, expression level, and neurodevelopmental stage in which functional TBCD is
delivered. To enhance translation and validate that the lead construct provides comparable TBCD expression in
the context of human brain cell types, we will treat previously established patient-derived COs with the lead
AAV9-TBCD construct and assess for phenotypic rescue. Utilizing this rigorous and multidisciplinary approach,
we aim to uncover molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the profound deficits in TBCD-related
developmental and epileptic encephalopathy; establish the first tractable in vitro and in vivo models of TBCD;
and evaluate a highly translatable and potentially transformative AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy."
10778913,"AI-Powered MRI Quality Control and Artifact Correction for Multi-Site Studies
Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while commonly employed to investigate brain structure and function, is
susceptible to imaging artifacts caused for instance by eye and head motion, hemodynamic changes, and mag-
netic field inhomogeneities. Identifying images with questionable quality, correcting for artifacts, and discarding
unusable images reduce biases in subsequent analyses, and therefore help avoid erroneous conclusions. In
this project, we will develop computational tools, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), for image quality assess-
ment (IQA) and retrospective artifact correction (RAC), catering to large-scale studies involving multiple imaging
centers.
In Aim 1, we will develop a deep learning framework for automatic, objective, fast, and accurate IQA of structural
MRI data. IQA is typically performed via visual inspection by MRI technologists and can be time-consuming,
subjective, and error-prone. Our method will complete IQA in milliseconds with high sensitivity and specificity. It
will be designed to be easily trainable with a small amount of annotated data via semi-supervised learning. It can
be used immediately after each scan to determine whether the acquired data are usable and whether re-scan is
necessary. It can also be used in post-acquisition data curation to automatically identify usable images from huge
image datasets. We will also develop a deep learning framework to rapidly generate derivatives, such as cortical
surfaces, for inspection to ensure sufficient image quality for downstream analyses. In Aim 2, we will develop a
novel RAC method to remove artifacts without requiring modification of sequences or mounting of motion markers.
Existing RAC neural networks are typically trained in a supervised manner, requiring the scanning of the same
subjects motionless and with deliberate motions. In contrast, our RAC method will be based on unsupervised
learning, simply requiring the user to provide for training a set of clean and corrupted images, which can be from
different individuals. Our method is therefore practical with considerably better adaptability. In Aim 3, we will
develop techniques that will allow the methods developed in Aims 1 and 2 to be adapted to and optimized for
different imaging centers, MRI scanners, and imaging protocols without requiring explicit exchange of imaging
data across sites, which often requires data sharing agreements between institutions. The techniques developed
in this aim will help overcome data sharing challenges for site-optimized IQA and RAC.
Successful completion of this project will allow image quality assurance to be done automatically in large-scale,
multi-site, and longitudinal studies, and increase the amount of usable data for improving statistical power."

There is increasing knowledge that volunteering is salutary for volunteers’ cardiovascular health.
At the same time, more than 50% of adults over the age of 50 in the U.S. report at least one
cardiovascular risk such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and chronic inflammation.
Despite decades of research indicating that frequent volunteers show better cardiovascular
disease (CVD) biomarkers, little is known whether frequent and sustained volunteering affects
change in CVD biomarkers in multiple population subgroups, net of selection into volunteering.
Further, genetic susceptibility to CVD biomarkers has never been studied in the context of
volunteering. Our preliminary data show that frequent volunteering (200+ hours a year) predicts
favorable CVD biomarkers, including chronic inflammation, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure
in longitudinal analysis even when selection effects are considered through inverse probability
treatment weighting. This highlights a critical need for understanding the pathways by which
genetic, social, and behavioral factors affect cardiovascular health in older adults (NIA strategic
research priorities B-2). In response to PA-20-185 and NOT-AG-21-020 Maximizing the
Scientific Value of Secondary Analyses of Existing Datasets, the present study uses the Health
and Retirement Study and seeks to understand whether changes in volunteering are linked to
CVD biomarkers over a decade after adjusting for selection into volunteering and pre-baseline
characteristics, and whether these links are stronger for multiple genetic, demographic, and
socioeconomic subgroups. Using seven CVD biomarkers and polygenic risk scores, this study
addresses three specific aims: Aim 1) examine the longitudinal effects of sustained volunteering
on CVD biomarkers (N=18,847), Aim 2) test the associations between genetic predictors of
CVD biomarkers, volunteering and CVD biomarkers in multiple ancestry groups (European
N=8,400, African N=1,605), and Aim 3) assess the effect heterogeneity of volunteering on CVD
biomarkers in multiple genetic, demographic, and socioeconomic subgroups. This project seeks
to quantify the effects of volunteering on multiple CVD biomarkers while addressing important
questions about selection effects and genetic susceptibility for a better causal inference.
Addressing this gap in research is critical for developing new public health policies and
biobehavioral and social interventions for heart-healthy older adults."
10925417,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The objective of this proposal is to create a new robotic system that enables bladder tumors to be removed
completely and intact. Currently they are removed piecemeal, which spreads cancer cells, and results in incon-
clusive diagnosis and staging, which dramatically increases morbidity and mortality for patients. Our system will
deliver two needle-sized, tentacle-like arms through the port of a standard transurethral endoscope, enabling
dexterous and independent tissue manipulation, electrosurgical dissection, and visualization.
Clinical significance comes from the large number of patients who experience bladder cancer – 81,180 new
diagnoses per year in the USA alone [12] – as well as the high morbidity and mortality these patients face.
17,000 people die each year from the disease and tumors recur 78% of the time [47]. This is believed to be due
to the current need to remove the tumor piecemeal, rather than intact, which results in positive margins, spreads
cancer cells, and makes pathological assessment highly uncertain. Our system aims to enable tumors to be
removed intact, with no positive margins, and with muscle tissue attached, which will enable accurate, timely
diagnosis, with critical, urgently needed staging information.
The Innovation that enables our system to be so small is that we harness elastic interactions of curved tubes to
create miniature, dexterous surgical instruments that can bend and elongate. These instruments pass through
the port in an existing clinical transurethral endoscope to provide tentacle-like dexterity at its tip. Our system
is innovative because it provides dexterity and visualization at the 8.6mm diameter needed to pass through the
urethra, i.e. 1/4 the diameter of the smallest single port robots used clinically today. We hypothesize that providing
the surgeon with two hands that can move independently of the endoscope we will make intact removal of bladder
tumors more accurate. This will reduce positive margin rates and provide samples with muscle attached, which is
known to facilitate accurate staging. Also, because our system has dramatically fewer mechanical and electronic
components than current commercial surgical robots, it can be made approximately 10 times less expensive,
while still providing a healthy revenue stream and profit margin for our company.
Approach In our Phase I equivalent preliminary studies, we demonstrated that concentric tubes can be delivered
through an endoscope and controlled robotically by a surgeon. Leveraging these exciting preliminary studies,
in this direct to Phase II project, we convert our system into a clinical product and experimentally demonstrate
that it improves resection accuracy and facilitates obtaining intact specimens with negative margins and muscle
attached, in realistic phantom and cadaver studies. To do this, in Aim 1, we design an OR-ready support system
and perform benchtop verification of system accuracy. In Aim 2 we perform both formative and summative human
factors studies to ensure the usability and safety of the system. In Aim 3 we validate the system experimentally
in anthropomorphic phantoms and cadavers. The endpoint of this Phase II project will be a system that is ready
to undergo final FDA testing (e.g. biocompatibility, sterility, electromagnetic interference, etc.), in preparation for
initial human clinical use."

and resistance to drive lead optimization, 3) characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles, in vivo antimalarial
efficacy, and safety of optimized boron-containing antimalarials, and 4) advance an optimized boron-containing
compound to Candidate status."

Cardiac arrest has an estimated annual incidence of 250-350,000 out-of-hospital and 250-750,000 in-hospital
events in the U.S., with survival rates as low as 5% and 20% respectively. These outcomes reflect a two-step
injury process: a) ischemia during cessation of blood flow and b) secondary reperfusion and inflammatory injury
following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). With only 3-7% of CA survivors recovering to their pre-CA
neurological status, developing interventions to attenuate reperfusion injury are critical to improve patients’
survival and neurological outcomes. A series of animal and human studies have shown that the use of
pharmacological interventions targeted against excitoxicity, oxidative injury and inflammatory pathways may
reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury and improve post-CA survival and neurological outcomes. A small-scale
randomized control trial (RCT) has provided preliminary evidence to support the hypothesis that magnesium
(Mg) in the post-CA period as a neuroprotective agent may improve neurological outcomes among survivors.
However, additional data is needed to support its use as standard of care in the post-CA period. We therefore
propose to collect necessary and sufficient data to design a multisite RCT of Mg neuroprotection following CA.
We hypothesize that administering Mg in the post-CA period is feasible and safe, and that it may attenuate
excitotoxity, thereby ameliorating the downstream cascade of reperfusion injuries associated with morbidity and
mortality. The current application proposes three aims: For Aim 1, a single site pilot RCT will assess the feasibility
and safety of administrating Mg and collecting serum samples post-CA. The effects of Mg on serum markers of
brain injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as, rates of ROSC, survival and independent neurological
function will also be assessed. For Aim 2, researchers will establish single-IRB (S-IRB) approval for a multi-site
pilot RCT of Mg post-CA using Exception From Informed Consent (EFIC). Eligible sites will then be invited to
participate in a pilot study. For Aim 3, sites identified in Aim 2 will demonstrate capacity for recruitment and data
collection by administering the Mg therapy in up to 4 and placebo in up to 4 post-CA patients. The data obtained
through the execution of Aims 1-3 will be used to inform the design and implementation of a large-scale trial to
assess the impact of Mg (with standard post-CA care) versus placebo (with standard post-CA care) on survival
and independent neurological function after CA."
10925398,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Normal sensory perception and motor control depend on dynamic functional interactions among different
regions of the neocortex. Dysfunction in these interactions can lead to devastating neurological and
neuropsychiatric disorders. While interactions among cortical areas are thought to be mediated primarily by
direct synaptic connections between cortical neurons (i.e. direct corticocortical connections), the thalamus may
also play a crucial role in these interactions. The thalamus is an obligatory relay for most sensory information
sent to the cortex, and the cortex sends massive feedback projections to thalamus, modulating sensory
throughput. Relay cells in higher-order thalamic nuclei receive especially strong corticothalamic synaptic
inputs from projection neurons in cortical layer 5, and these same thalamic relay cells also send strong
thalamocortical synaptic inputs to secondary/higher order cortex. Thus, in addition to monosynaptic
corticocortical connections, distinct cortical areas might also interact disynaptically via higher-order thalamus
(the “transthalamic corticocortical pathway”). Despite previous anatomical demonstrations, the functional role
of the transthalamic corticocortical pathway remains poorly understood. The primary goal of my proposal is to
investigate how higher-order visual thalamus (the lateral posterior nucleus, LP) mediates functional interactions
between primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortex in awake, behaving mice, and how direct corticocortical
inputs are integrated with transthalamic corticocortical inputs in V2. These investigations will significantly
enhance our understanding of the thalamic contribution to dynamic cortical interactions and expand my training
in experimental and analytical techniques as I prepare for an independent investigator position. My research
proposal consists of three specific aims: 1) To study how the transthalamic interactions between V1 and V2
depend on arousal, 2) To determine how activity in the transthalamic pathway between V1 and V2 shapes
visual responses in V2 neurons, and 3) To investigate how synaptic inputs from direct corticocortical
projections and transthalamic corticocortical projections are integrated by V2 neurons, and what types of
information these two projections carry during active visually guided behavior. During the K99 phase, under
the guidance of Dr. Jessica Cardin and the support of my advisory committee (Drs. Michael Higley and Michael
Crair), I will become proficient in several techniques, including in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of neuronal
populations and axon terminals and in vivo optogenetic manipulations. During the R00 phase and beyond, my
goal is to combine an array of techniques (from detailed study of synaptic transmission in vitro to large-scale
monitoring of neuronal activity in task-engaged animals) to study the dynamic interactions between various
cortical and thalamic pathways of the visual system, how these interactions develop, and how these
interactions underlie visual behavior in both normal and pathological states."
10744238,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the ocular surface, characterized by
disruption of the epithelial barrier and sustained ocular surface inflammation, which in severe cases results
in blindness from corneal ulceration and scarring. DED is arguably the most common ophthalmologic
condition for which patients visit eye care professionals, with more than 16 million US adults estimated to
have been diagnosed with DED (several folds higher than age-related macular degeneration). Notably, the
prevalence of DED increases with age. The financial burden of DED to the US healthcare system is vast,
with direct costs and expenses from productivity losses estimated to exceed $3.5 billion annually.
 The work of several laboratories, including the Principal Investigator's, has revealed key insights
concerning the immunopathogenesis of DED. There is now strong evidence that T helper-17 (Th17) cells
are critical promoters of immune-mediated damage to the ocular surface. The PI's laboratory has shown
that memory Th17 (mTh17) cells maintain disease chronicity, resulting in ocular surface epitheliopathy that
persists for many months after exposure to desiccating stress. Moreover, data from the PI's lab show that
regulatory T cells (Tregs) are defective in suppressing the Th17 response in DED. In addition, the PI's lab
has identified critical mechanisms controlling antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation and trafficking in
DED, as well as effector Th17 priming, expansion and homing. Despite substantial progress in unraveling
underlying immunopathogenic mechanisms, important questions remain unanswered.
 We hypothesize that (1) chronic DED is characterized by long-term impairment in the function of
regulatory T cells (Tregs) that normally maintain immune quiescence, and that (2) the aged are more
susceptible to DED due to a larger pool of memory Th17, whose function is inadequately regulated by aged
Tregs. The principal objectives of this project are to (i) precisely define the phenotypic changes that
characterize, and the mechanisms that promote long-term Treg dysfunction in DED; (ii) determine the
cellular precursors of mTh17 cells, as well as the cytokine mechanisms that influence the generation of
immunologic memory; and (iii) define the factors that amplify mTh17 immunity in aging. To achieve these
objectives, three specific aims have been defined to answer the following questions: Aim 1: What are the
causative mechanisms of enduring Treg dysfunction in DED? Aim 2: Which effector Th17 subsets are
predisposed to enter the memory pool (thus permitting DED chronicity), and what factors regulate this
process? And finally Aim 3: What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms that augment Th17-mediated
DED in aging? It is anticipated that this research will have significant translational impact given the high
prevalence of DED, the still limited knowledge we have regarding its immunopathogenesis, and the relative
scarcity of effective treatments."
10741255,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA), which together affect >1 million children annually,
are associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). Our data show that some systemic
factors are associated with NDI in CM and SMA (e.g., endothelial dysregulation, acute kidney injury), but
others are associated with NDI CM alone (e.g., inflammatory cytokines). Our findings suggest that both shared
and unique systemic pathways contribute to NDI in CM vs. SMA. While our studies to date have advanced
understanding of systemic pathways that may lead to NDI in children with CM or SMA, the central nervous
system (CNS) pathways that contribute to NDI in children after CM or SMA remain unknown. In children with
CM, the relationship of CNS findings to NDI has rarely been assessed, while in children with SMA, there is a
paucity of CNS testing. Without data on how CNS pathways relate to NDI after CM or SMA, optimal
interventions to prevent or mitigate NDI cannot be developed. The central hypotheses of this study are that the
contribution of systemic factors to NDI in CM or SMA is mediated by CNS factors, and that the specific factors
and relative contributions of factors differ in CM and SMA. The proposed study will leverage investment by
Indiana University (IU) in an IU-Global Health Uganda Center for Child Neurodevelopment in Jinja, Uganda. IU
will donate a Hyperfine mobile MRI and BrainAmp EEG to the Center, and provide training in MRI, EEG and
TCD testing. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) identify CNS risk factors for neurodevelopment
impairment (NDI) after CM vs. SMA; 2) establish systemic risk factors for NDI after CM vs. SMA; and 3) define
the pathways by which systemic and CNS factors contribute to NDI after CM vs. SMA. We will conduct the
study in a cohort of 620 children 6 months to 4 years of age (120 children with CM, 300 with SMA, 100 with
uncomplicated malaria and 100 community children) who will be followed for 12 months after disease/
enrollment and have neurodevelopmental testing at 12-month follow-up. CNS pathways will be evaluated
through bedside MRI testing with the Hyperfine Swoop MRI, quantitative EEG and evoked response potential
testing, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound evaluation of cerebral blood flow patterns. Systemic pathways
identified in prior studies as associated with brain injury, long-term neurodevelopment or both will be tested for
reproducibility. Finally, established and novel statistical models will be used to identify systemic and CNS risk
factors and mediation pathways for long-term NDI. We expect that unique systemic and CNS pathways will
lead to NDI in CM compared to SMA. Identification of these pathways will allow for targeted interventions to
prevent NDI in the millions of children with CM or SMA. The study will constitute a major advance in the
understanding of the pathophysiology of brain injury and recovery in severe malaria, and provide critical new
information on brain biology that will inform studies of other childhood CNS diseases."
10758532,"Hypertension affects one in three US adults, yet only 50% have their blood pressure adequately
controlled. Hypertension is twice as prevalent in black adults than non-Hispanic whites; consequently, blacks
are 2 to 3 times more likely to die of hypertension-related heart disease than their white counterparts. While
many factors contribute to these disparities, a lack of treatment intensification, the underuse or prescribing of
racially-based oral antihypertensives, and suboptimal follow-up care are thought to be central in the context of
racial/ethnic disparities.
 Health information technology (health IT) solutions, such as decision support in electronic health record
(EHR) systems, could help reduce these gaps in care, but few studies have evaluated the use of these
strategies in health systems caring for a large population of minority patients. Similarly, while decision support
has been widely-used, it has rarely been employed to emphasize racial differences in care, to support racially-
sensitive treatment recommendations, or to help address barriers to care that are more common among
minority subgroups. Decision support has generally been used as a single approach and has not been
integrated with other health IT strategies like patient portals to improve patient communication. More generally,
most tools have also not been designed using principles from the rapidly-emerging field of behavioral science.
 To this end, we propose a pragmatic randomized effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trial to test
the impact of a racially-tailored multicomponent health IT intervention on racial and ethnic disparities in
hypertension control. This trial will be conducted at Advocate Health, the largest integrated delivery network in
Illinois, which serves a multi-ethnic patient population throughout the Chicago area and has extensive
experience conducting research studies and pragmatic clinical trials with numerous academic partners.
 The specific aims of the study are to: (1) design and pilot test racially-informed health IT tools to address
racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension control using a patient advisory board and provider focus groups; (2)
conduct a 2-arm pragmatic cluster randomized trial with partial crossover to determine whether racially-
informed health IT tools improve blood pressure control and reduce disparities in minority populations; and (3)
evaluate the acceptability and adoptability of the health IT interventions by patients, providers, and clinics,
including whether the intervention reduces disparities in adoption rates of patient portals.
 Using a rigorous randomized design, we have proposed a pragmatic and scalable approach to optimizing
health IT tools to address disparities. Our multidisciplinary study team consists of experts in racial/ethnic
disparities, hypertension, health IT, patient and provider behavior change, and pragmatic trials. The expected
overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how health IT can be optimized
to improve health disparities in ways that are scalable and integrated into healthcare systems."
10845648,"Project Summary/Abstract
Enzymes play a critical role in biological processes, and measurements of enzyme activity in cells and tissues
are foundational to our understanding of physiology and pathophysiology. Measuring enzyme activity in vivo
provides context within the intact living tissue, enabling organ- or organism-level understanding of the spatial
and temporal differences in enzyme activity. However, most research regarding enzyme activity has been lim-
ited to in vitro and ex vivo methods due to our inability to observe enzyme activity with high sensitivity and high
resolution in deep tissues. Fluorescence-based techniques offer a non-invasive, high resolution look at molec-
ular or morphological information but are often hampered by limited tissue penetration. Imaging in optical tis-
sue windows in the short-wave infrared (SWIR; 900-1700 nm) enables deeper tissue penetration and improved
resolution than visible or NIR light due to reduced absorption and scattering by biological materials. Even at
ideal wavelengths, photoluminescence imaging requires incident light to excite the fluorophore, resulting in
light attenuation both going in and out of the tissue. Luciferase-based bioluminescence imaging eliminates the
need for external excitation, thereby reducing the distance light must traverse through tissue as well as elimi-
nating autofluorescence. While bioluminescence is preferred for many in vivo imaging applications, there are
no reports of SWIR-emitting luciferases, limiting this approach to less preferred visible wavelengths or NIR
probes emitting < 750 nm. In this proposal, bioluminescence energy transfer (BRET) from luciferases to SWIR-
emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) generate self-illuminating SWIR-emitting contrast agents. We pro-
pose the development of the first enzyme-sensing, SWIR-emitting, self-illuminating quantum dots
(QDs). Multiplexing reference and enzyme-cleavable probes for ratiometric in vivo imaging will calibrate the
enzyme activity to the local concentration of probes and is facilitated by our hyperspectral SWIR preclinical im-
ager. We will test our sensor by visualizing the activity of MMP-16, a cell-surface biomarker of liver disease
progression that is correlated with fibrosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To test our hypothe-
sis that dual probe imaging with self-illuminating, SWIR-emitting contrast agents will enable spatial and tem-
poral enzyme activity maps, we will design, characterize, and optimize the BRET probes in vitro. In parallel, we
will use tissue phantoms to compare the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) and image resolution using BRET vs. pho-
toluminescence excitation mechanisms. Finally, we will demonstrate the functionality of our sensor in phan-
toms and in a mouse model of liver cirrhosis. Successful completion of this project would result in a sensor ca-
pable of reporting MMP-16 activity deep in the liver with high resolution and high sensitivity. Demonstrating this
new way to take non-invasive, high resolution images of enzyme activity in deep tissues will enable a wide ar-
ray of new studies into the role of enzymes in pathophysiology by the scientific community."
10933463,"Approximately half a million operations are performed each year in VA hospitals across the country.4 Veterans
undergoing high-risk surgery have a 1 in 5 chance of suffering complications, a 1 in 10 chance of being readmitted
to the hospital within 30 days, and a 1 in 50 chance of dying within 30 days.4 Long-term survival is significantly
reduced for those patients who have perioperative complications, even if they survive to leave the hospital.5
Low fitness and poor functional status are among the strongest predictors of postsurgical
complications.1,2 Prehabilitation takes advantage of the weeks leading up to surgery in order to improve fitness,
mobility and nutrition in preparation for the upcoming surgical stress.13 Indeed, prehabilitation has been shown
to improve fitness and reduce complications and quality of life in high-risk surgical patients.7,9,12 The most
effective prehabilitation programs combine exercise plus nutritional support (are multimodal), and provide
exercise that is supervised and individualized, ensuring the appropriate exercise intensity and increasing it
gradually according to improvements in fitness and strength. Most supervised prehabilitation programs are
facility-based, but travel time, distance, and transportation limit participation.10 Unfortunately, home-based
prehabilitation programs have shown small effect sizes and low compliance rates, likely because adequate
training intensity is required in programs of such short duration, which is often not achieved with unsupervised
home-based programs.14-16 [[A prehabilitation program that is delivered using telehealth would be ideal,
because it combines accessibility with supervision, encouraging compliance and ensuring adequate training
intensity, but such programs do not currently exit within the VA]].
[[We aim to determine the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and effect size estimates for outcomes of interest of
a short-term (3-4 week) multimodal prehabilitation intervention that is supervised and individualized, yet is
delivered at home using telehealth technology.]] The exercise program will consist of 3 days of supervised
telehealth exercise sessions per week consisting of moderate intensity aerobic training and resistive and
functional training. Nutritional support will consist of tailored nutritional advice, whey protein
supplementation and multivitamin and vitamin D supplementation during prehabilitation and following
hospital discharge for [[6 weeks]]. Compliance with the interventions will be enhanced by daily automated text
messages using the VA Annie App. In addition, participants will be contacted weekly in order to identify
problems with compliance and to provide counseling. [[Post-operative exercise sessions will resume as early as
1 week postoperatively and progressed as allowed according to the type of surgery. Text messages and weekly
calls will also resume postoperatively until the 6-week follow-up visit to encourage progressive increases in
unsupervised physical activity and nutritional support. Objective physical activity data will be collected using
physical activity trackers, which patients will wear from the time of enrollment until the 6-week postoperative
follow-up visit. Follow-up will continue for a total of 6 months postoperatively.]]
The main outcomes of interest include feasibility (acceptance rates), acceptability (compliance rates), and safety
(number of adverse events). We will also measure changes in fitness, nutritional state, anxiety and depression,
and health-related quality of life throughout the study period in order to estimate effect sizes, which will inform
a future randomized trial. The proposed work combines several innovations in the delivery of exercise and
nutrition and applies them to the perioperative high-risk population for the first time. It constitutes the first step
toward the study of a multimodal “tele-prehabilitation” program on postoperative and long-term outcomes
following high-risk surgery."
10763807,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Over the previous funding period, it was shown that the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine
is a key signal of amino acid sufficiency. Methionine functions by boosting the synthesis of its
downstream metabolite S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as the biological methyl donor in
many one-carbon transfer reactions critical for life. This application proposes to
comprehensively investigate the mechanisms by which methionine and SAM function to
regulate important cellular pathways in balancing cell growth versus survival in response to
metabolic state. A combination of genetics and biochemistry will be utilized to elucidate how
methionine and SAM regulate phosphorylation-based signaling, epigenetic methylation
modifications on chromatin, as well as the transcription and translation of sulfur metabolism
genes. Insights from these studies will be informative as to the role of these sentinel metabolites
in aging and age-related diseases."
10763894,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability, and has a very sudden onset. Families are often
thrust into providing care without sufficient training from health care providers, having to learn on their own to
provide care. Studies show that caregiving without proper training can be detrimental to caregiver’s physical
and mental health, which can impede survivor rehabilitation and lead to institutionalization and higher societal
costs. Unlike existing stroke caregiver interventions, which require costly face-to-face interactions, and that
focus primarily on the survivor’s care, the nurse-led Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK II) is
delivered completely by telephone, and empowers caregivers to address both their own and the survivor’s
needs using innovative skill-building strategies. Aligned with current patient and caregiver guidelines, TASK II
demonstrated evidence of content validity, treatment fidelity, caregiver satisfaction, and efficacy for reducing
caregiver depressive symptoms; however, TASK II revealed a need for a stronger focus on self-management
(SM) strategies to improve caregiver symptoms and health, along with enhanced use of other telehealth modes
of delivery. In an NINR-funded R21, the Telehealth Assessment and Skill-building Kit (TASK III) was optimized
through the innovative leveraging of technologies and SM strategies to improve stroke family caregiver
symptoms and health. A new goal setting tip sheet promotes caregivers’ self-management of their own
symptoms and health through the use of novel skill-building strategies. Caregivers now choose how they want
to access the TASK III Resource Guide (mailed hard copy, eBook, USB drive, or interactive website
(https://www.task3web.com/) and how they would like to interact with the nurse (telephone, FaceTime, or
online videoconferencing). Preliminary TASK III data provided evidence for feasibility of recruitment, retention,
treatment fidelity, high satisfaction, and positive data trends in 74 stroke family caregivers randomized to TASK
III (n=36) or to an Information, Support, and Referral (ISR) group (n=38). The purpose of the proposed study is
to test short-term (immediately post-intervention at 8 weeks) and long-term (12, 24, and 52 weeks) efficacy of
the TASK III intervention, compared with the ISR group, in 296 stroke caregivers. The primary outcome is
caregiver life changes (i.e., physical health, physical functioning, emotional well-being, general health) as a
result of providing care. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms (in caregivers with mild to severe
depressive symptoms), other symptoms (stress, fatigue, sleep, pain, shortness of breath), unhealthy days, SM
of diet/exercise, and self-reported healthcare utilization. Theoretically-based mediators include task difficulty,
threat appraisal, and self-efficacy. Program evaluation outcomes (satisfaction, technology ratings) will also be
analyzed. If TASK III is shown to be efficacious in the proposed randomized controlled clinical trial, our next
goal will be to translate TASK III into ongoing stroke systems of care; and to adapt it for use among caregivers
with other debilitating/chronic conditions providing a tremendous public health impact."

This K08 mentored physician-scientist award proposal has been designed to facilitate my development into an
independent investigator studying calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Common in the elderly, and with our
aging population, CAVD is expected to affect 4.5 million individuals globally by 2030. CAVD is a progressive
disease in which the aortic valves (AV) become increasingly thickened and calcified, ultimately leading to severe
AV narrowing, symptoms, left ventricular pressure overload leading to heart failure, and death. Conventional
treatment for severe CAVD is transcatheter or surgical AV replacement (AVR). However, as a cardiologist, I
have cared for too many patients who were ineligible for these procedures as well as those who suffered from
peri-procedural complications such as stroke, and understand the need for preventative therapies. Unfortunately,
effective medical therapies preventing the development or progression of CAVD do not currently exist, due to a
failure of clinical trials in this arena to address causal risk factors. Recently, multiple human epidemiologic and
genetic, as well as in vitro studies, have implicated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], the major lipoprotein carrier of oxidized
phospholipids (OxPL) as a risk factor for CAVD. While elevated Lp(a) levels, present in 35% of individuals with
CAVD, does not represent a universal risk factor, it identifies patients who are at highest risk for poor outcomes
and who may benefit from targeted therapies against Lp(a) and/or OxPL if these are determined to be causal
risk factors. The research goals of this proposal are to: 1) test the hypothesis that Lp(a) and its OxPL content
cause the development and progression of CAVD in vivo and 2) define the mechanisms by which Lp(a) and
OxPL mediate CAVD in vivo. In preliminary work, I have established transgenic mouse models expressing Lp(a)
that binds OxPL, mutant Lp(a) lacking OxPL binding, and Lp(a) in combination with a natural antibody that binds
and neutralizes OxPL, which are uniquely available only in our laboratory and will be used for this proposal. The
K08 will build upon my background as a cardiologist and a basic scientist in lipid metabolism by providing the
following training objectives: 1) acquire independent skills in molecular imaging to study AV calcification, a central
pathogenic process in progression of CAVD, using mouse models, 2) develop expertise in echocardiographic
assessment of AV hemodynamics, used clinically to monitor progression of CAVD, in mice, 3) acquire expertise
in proteomic analysis of AVs to understand pathways involved in CAVD, and 4) gain the knowledge and skills
needed to be a successful independent investigator through guidance from my multidisciplinary mentorship team
including Drs. Sotirios (Sam) Tsimikas, Joseph Witztum, Elena Aikawa, and Kirk Peterson, as well as carefully
selected coursework. By the end of this award period, I expect to not only have gained invaluable insight into the
mechanisms underlying the progression of AV calcification, but also acquired expertise and preliminary data
needed to compete for R01 funding and to translate this knowledge into novel medical therapies for CAVD."

Sepsis is a major burden to the healthcare system being the most common cause for admission to the intensive
care unit and the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals. It is a complex physiologic condition involving
a heterogenous patient population with high morbidity and mortality, and no specific therapies aside from
supportive measures. Clinical studies indicate that obesity is paradoxically associated with improved survival in
sepsis; however, the mechanisms behind this obesity-mediated protection are not known. Capitalizing on the
unique resistance in this patient population may allow for the development of novel therapies to prevent the
morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis. The primary goals of my research program are to 1) investigate
differences in sepsis pathophysiology in patients stratified by obesity status with a major focus on immune
alterations, and 2) define shifts in immune cell function and metabolism in obesity, and determine their roles in
conferring protection during sepsis utilizing a validated murine model and patient samples. The gained
information will aid in the development strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in sepsis."

Sensorimotor integration often requires the brain to transform its representation of space between different
coordinate systems. The mechanism of visuomotor coordinate transformation has been heavily investigated from
a theoretical perspective and in the context of visually-guided arm, head, and eye movements in mammals.
However, the underlying neural computations are still not well-understood. Coordinate transformations are also
essential to visuomotor behavior in insects, and I am now uniquely positioned to address this question by
leveraging the full brain connectome and genetic toolkit available in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Indeed,
I have discovered a neural network in the Drosophila brain that appears well-positioned to perform such an
inference. Therefore, I will use two-photon calcium imaging and whole cell recordings in walking flies to
functionally and anatomically dissect the circuitry that underlies steering during object pursuit behavior. In doing
so, this project will provide a mechanistic dissection of the control systems and coordinate transformations that
guide visuomotor coupling."

The objective of this MIRA is to expand research and development within the field of high-throughput, single cell
analysis to address challenges with how cells are screened, how data are collected and processed, and how
effectively different technologies quantitatively inform biomedicine. For many years (and under the auspices of
a current R01), our laboratory's main efforts have focused on the development of TRFC as a unique form of
cytometry that captures fluorescence lifetimes and/or decay kinetic profiles from fluorescently labeled particles
and cells so as to sort and/or analyze cell-to-cell differences with the lifetime as a distinguishing parameter. The
main goal for this MIRA will be to exploit the state-of-the-art in time-resolved flow cytometry (TRFC) and take
this area of research to new heights. That is, we will seek to advance TRFC so that it supports multi-color
cytometry, microfluidic-based cytometry, viscoelastic cytometry, optical redox cytometry, and potentially imaging
cytometry. The main application to be studied will be changes in metabolic pathways of cells by exploiting
autofluorescence lifetimes of free and bound NAD(P)H and FAD. We will focus on predictive and metabolic
models of the dynamic changes in cellular respiration for cultured breast cancer cells treated with tamoxifen.
With a flexible MIRA we will seek out different ways that TRFC can inform changes in cells when treated and
whey they exhibit chemoresistance. One way to accomplish this will be through quantitative optical redox
measurements with a TRFC system. Additionally, in a tangentially field of cytometry, this work will develop a
new area of research involving sorting and separation of exosomes and microvesicles from cells. We will build
on our existing computational fluid dynamic models to do so. In general, the development of advanced, sensitive,
and time-dependent cytometry system is impacting beyond the metabolic and exosome applications proposed.
Accordingly, this work is the first step toward evaluating the benefits, demonstrating the quantitative nature, and
setting the stage for broad use across many more cytometric applications."

Cells are highly complex living nanomachines with beautiful structures of great precision. This is true not only
for free living organisms like ciliates or radiolarians, but also for cells inside the human body. These
complicated structures are directly linked to the physiological functions of cells, and alterations in cell geometry
are a hallmark of many disease states. Yet in most cases we have almost no information about how cells
determine their geometry at the level of organelle size and shape. Thus, understanding the origins of cell
geometry remains a fundamental unsolved problem in cell biology. Part of the challenge is that cell geometry
involves multiple spatial scales ranging from molecules up to the whole cell. Spanning this gap between
scales requires us to go beyond traditional molecular biology approaches and bring in methods from physics
and engineering. For this reason my proposal is based on an integrated combination of approaches, using
several different model organisms and cell types to address the origins of cell geometry at several different
size scales. At the level of single organelles, I will continue to probe the mechanism of flagellar length control
as a paradigm for organelle size regulation, with a focus on learning how cells can sense the length of their
flagella. At a larger scale, we will continue our development of the classic model organism, Stentor coeruleus,
as a genomic model system for analyzing global cell morphogenesis and regeneration. Using Stentor, we
intend to pursue the two linked questions of how a cell knows that is geometry has been perturbed, and what
molecules it uses to encode positional information needed to direct the re-assembly of a correct cell geometry.
Both of these questions that have general significance to all cell types but are particularly easy to study in
Stentor. Our proposed work is unified by the focus on a single question – where does geometry come from
inside a cell. We will use different model systems to address different aspects of this question, but in all cases
we will take an interdisciplinary approach that combines tools of genetics, genomics, microscopy, image
analysis, and mathematical modeling."

Significance: Trichotillomania (TTM), characterized by repeated pulling of one’s hair to the point of hair loss or
thinning, produces impairment in physical, social, psychological and occupational functioning. While
evidenced-based treatments (EBTs, i.e. self-monitoring, stimulus control, and Habit Reversal Training (HRT))
do exist, access is limited due to lack of trained treatment providers as well as lack of willingness to seek
treatment due to the shame and guilt associated with TTM. This project builds on the success of our Phase I
project, where we validated a discreet wearable device’s ability to detect the subtle motions associated with
TTM, thereby improving awareness of the behavior. We further incorporated HRT into the device and app
system. We also found a significant reduction of trichotillomania symptom severity in a pilot trial. We plan to
further incorporate the EBTs for TTM into the system and test for efficacy in a 70-person RCT in this Phase II.
Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that a device and app system can deliver personalized and relevant EBTs at
the right time. It is further hypothesized this system would be clinically effective in reducing TTM severity
relative to an active control condition. The system will identify possible TTM episodes using passively detected
contextual factors, in addition to the patient’s historical pulling episode record from the device. To build this
predictive model, we will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to record high fidelity TTM episode
frequency and context across 40 participants with TTM. Thus, for example, if a patient typically pulls at a given
known place and time (e.g., the library in evenings), the system will deliver an EBT reminder when the user is
at that location (e.g., reminding the user to sit in a crowded area and clench fists).
Specific Aim 1: We will develop foundational elements to deliver EBTs via the device and app system through
iterative feedback with 10 clinicians and 10 patients. We will refine concept materials to deploy a functional
assessment of the user’s TTM, determine a comprehensive list of EBT reminders (i.e. stimulus control and
Habit Reversal Training) for common situations, and also develop a provider directory and data portal.
Specific Aim 2: We will develop the back-end predictive model based on EMA data from 20 patients over 6
weeks. EBT reminders will be tested for accuracy on a new set of 20 patients over 6 weeks. The HabitAware
app and device will then be modified to deploy the predictive EBT reminder model.
Specific Aim 3: We will first conduct an Open Trial of ten participants with the device and app system to
ensure system functionality. We will then conduct a 70-participant RCT with an active control “reminder
bracelet with app journaling” condition to establish efficacy based on change in TTM symptom severity.
Long-Term Goal: The overall system will be commercialized and allow patients access to a clinically effective
system for TTM, increasing access to EBTs significantly at a fraction of the price of traditional treatment."
10766812,"Accurate measurement of free-living physical activity (PA), energy expenditure (EE), and sleep of children (5-12yrs) is
complex, with no single method free of limitations. Validation studies of PA, EE, and sleep have demonstrated that
combining HR and accelerometry data (e.g., steps, counts, raw signal) provides the most accurate estimate of PA, EE,
and sleep. Unfortunately, the simultaneous collection of HR and accelerometry over routine monitoring timeframes (e.g.,
7 days) has been limited because historically measuring HR has relied on uncomfortable chest strap telemetry.
Advancements in wearable technology have eliminated this issue by incorporating the noninvasive assessment of HR
via photoplethysmography in widely-available consumer wearable devices (e.g., FitBits, Garmin) that also include
accelerometry. Studies have shown that HR estimates from consumer wearables are comparable to those collected via
ECG or chest strap telemetry. However, validation studies of consumer wearables have focused almost exclusively on
proprietary activity output (e.g., steps) and have mostly been conducted on healthy adults, older adults, or clinical
populations (e.g., people with neuromuscular or gait abnormalities). Consumer wearables hold promise for collecting
PA, EE, and sleep data with children 5 to 12yrs, yet no studies have been conducted to establish their validity and
utility/feasibility in this population. The objectives of the proposed project are to conduct a series of studies that include
both laboratory and field-based protocols to evaluate the reliability, validity and utility/feasibility of consumer wearables
for measuring children’s PA, EE, and sleep in free-living conditions. We will evaluate the different features of the devices
(e.g., PA, HR) in the lab and in real-world conditions. In addition, we will evaluate the utility/feasibility of consumer
wearables for multi-day wear compliance. We will accomplish the following aims. Aim 1. Develop and validate open-
source equations to estimate PAEE and time spent physically active using the activity and HR data from consumer
wearables compared to the PAEE output from the consumer wearables’ proprietary processing algorithms and a
criterion measure of PAEE (i.e., indirect calorimetry). Aim 2. Develop and validate open-source equations to estimate
total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and timing from consumer wearables using their activity and HR data compared to the
sleep output from the consumer wearables’ proprietary processing algorithms and a criterion measure of sleep (i.e.,
PSG and actigraphy). Aim 3. Evaluate the validity of the PAEE and sleep equation estimates from the algorithms created
in Aim 1 & 2 against a criterion (i.e., Actiheart) under free-living conditions. This project is significant because it will be
among the first to establish the validity of consumer wearables for PAEE and sleep monitoring of children. This project
is innovative as it will use advanced statistical modeling techniques, including machine learning, to systematically test
the validity and utility/feasibility of consumer wearables for children. Our vision is to leverage the biometric data collected
across consumer wearables to produce estimates of PAEE and sleep in children. This will allow practitioners and
researchers alike to more accurately measure 24-hour movement behaviors in children."

of obesity and diabetes than the general population and the COVID-19 pandemic has made these groups even
more vulnerable to developing these preventable chronic diseases. Active transportation is an underused
source of physical activity but is particularly relevant to low-income groups. A major and consistent correlate of
active transportation is use of public transit, and transit users engage in 5-15 more minutes/day of overall PA
that non-users. Public transit may also support access to healthy eating and health services. Citywide policies to
increase use of public transit have promise for improving health markers but have been substantially
underexplored. As an effort to improve economic conditions among low-income groups, Kansas City, MO
(KCMO; 500K residents; 43,000 daily bus trips) has become the only major city in the U.S. to permanently
adopt an ongoing zero-fare bus transit (ZBT) policy. The policy has eliminated all bus fares across the city. This
provides an extraordinary opportunity to examine impacts of such policies on bus ridership and subsequently
on bus users' physical activity, healthy eating, and weight status. In this proposed study, we will collect bus
ridership data before and up to 3 years after ZBT in KCMO and multiple comparison cities. To investigate
health information, study participants will be recruited from a large primary care health system serving low-
income communities. Participants will complete measures of bus use, and height and weight information will be
obtained from the health system's electronic health record before and up to 3 years after ZBT. A subsample of
participants will complete a 7-day objective physical activity assessment and questionnaires on their healthy
eating, perceptions of the ZBT policy, and barriers/facilitators to riding the bus. Community residents will collect
neighborhood environment information around bus stops to test as barriers to bus ridership and support
advocacy efforts. A state-of-the-art synthetic control approach will be used to compare ridership trends across
cities and weight status trajectories between post-ZBT bus users and non-bus users. The synthetic controls will
be a weighted combination of multiple control participants to provide a better comparison than any single
control alone. This study has significant implications for advancing knowledge and evidence on the potential
health impacts of ZBT policies. Findings will produce information that will be usable by other natural
experiment researchers and healthcare entities, as well as by local, state, and federal governments in making
determinations on use of public policy approaches such as ZBT as a lever for obesity- and diabetes-related
risk reduction in low-income communities."

 Proper regulation of gene expression is required for cellular function. Conversely, dysregulation of gene
expression is a major cause of disease. Furthermore, expression of two genes is frequently coupled. Coupled
expression is expected if two genes respond to the same signal or are expressed from a bidirectional promoter
(BDP). About one in ten human genes are controlled by a BDP, defined as two genes with less than 1 kilobase
between their transcription start sites. However, coupled expression in general and BDPs in particular remain
very poorly understood.
 The premise of this proposal is that our current lack of understanding of coupled expression is due to a
lack of tools. The goal of this proposal therefore is to develop an integrated experimental and computational
toolkit for real-time analysis of coupled nascent transcription. For example, we currently do not understand if
transcription of two BDP-controlled genes is synergistic, antagonistic, or independent in quantity and in time.
More generally, understanding coupled expression in both quantity and time requires real-time single-molecule
imaging of nascent transcription integrated with computational modeling.
 Here we propose to develop an experimental platform that allows direct visualization of nascent RNA of
two genes (Aim 1). Specifically, we will adapt RNA hairpin systems from bacteriophage to allow real-time
visualization and counting of single nascent RNAs in live cells. We will evaluate multiple microscope modalities
and optimize a microscopy platform for long-term gentle live-cell imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution.
Next, we will develop computational methods for quantification of nascent BDP transcription imaging data (Aim
2). We will also develop Bayesian Inference methods for inference of two-gene coupled nascent transcription
data, and identify the minimal mathematical models required to understand BDP transcription. Next, we will
apply these new experimental and computational tools for an initial exploration of BDPs (Aim 3). Specifically,
we will take a two-pronged approach exploring multiple BDPs at a safe-harbor locus as well as dedicated
studies of the endogenous NIPBL BDP. This will serve as proof-of-concept for our integrated toolkit.
 In summary, we propose to establish an integrated experimental and computational toolkit for real-time
analysis of coupled nascent transcription. We will devote significant efforts to disseminate the experimental
and computational tools and anticipate this being useful beyond BDP studies. We anticipate this toolkit will
allow future mechanistic studies to better understand BDPs, will make it possible to establish BDPs as
powerful tools for synthetic biology, and empower studies of coupled nascent transcription beyond BDPs."

The gastrointestinal epithelium plays a central role in maintaining barrier function while coordinating mucosal
homeostasis and immunity. An important negative consequence of excessive inflammation, ischemia, certain
infections, and other clinical conditions is mucosal epithelial injury and wounding that serves to compromise
the epithelial barrier which is tightly regulated by intercellular junctions that include the tight junction (TJ) and
adherens junction (AJ), collectively referred to as the Apical Junctional Complex (AJC). Proteins involved in
regulating epithelial polarity such as the Crumbs family of proteins, influence organization and function of the
AJC and regulate epithelial homeostasis and differentiation. Since most of studies on polarity proteins have
been performed in model organisms and transformed cell lines, current knowledge of the molecular basis by
which polarity proteins orchestrate intestinal epithelial barrier function and wound repair in vivo in mammals
remains limited. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify how the polarity protein Crumbs 3 (CRB3)
controls epithelial homeostasis, namely barrier function and wound repair in vivo using CRB3 transgenic mice
and natural human and murine intestinal epithelium. Our overarching hypothesis is that CRB3 functions as a
master regulator of intestinal epithelial barrier function and wound repair by controlling assembly of different
adhesion-cytoskeletal modules at the plasma membrane. Knowledge gained from these studies in the short
term will provide important new insights on basic mechanisms by which polarity proteins regulate the intestinal
epithelial barrier and repair. In the long term, these studies will likely provide ideas for development of new
therapeutic strategies aimed at strengthening the epithelial barrier and in promoting intestinal mucosal wound
repair."

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by loss of spinal and cortical motor neurons,
resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and eventually, death. The clinical heterogeneity and rapid
progression of ALS continues to confound the identification of treatment response biomarkers.
Currently, clinical trials (and practice) are forced to rely upon downstream indicators of disease status
such as muscle strength, respiratory function and functional rating scales. Such measures, although
validated, have a number of limitations. First, they have significant inter-rater variability. Second, the
measures usually have relatively slow rates of change and thus, require months and even years to
detect a treatment effect. These challenges underscore the unmet need for sensitive, reproducible, and
non-invasive biomarkers of therapy response. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop a
non-invasive imaging approach, termed relaxivity contrast imaging (RCI). Unlike existing image-based
biomarkers that reflect downstream changes in pathophysiology (e.g. T2 - edema, fat fraction), RCI is
uniquely sensitive to myofiber architectural features (e.g. reduced fiber diameter and density, fiber
atypia) exhibited by ALS patients. We hypothesize that RCI could serve as a
pharmacodynamic/response biomarker to show efficacy of and biological response to therapeutic
interventions in Phase 2/3 clinical trials of agents designed to slow or reverse neurodegeneration in
ALS patients. To develop RCI, we will use a validated computational framework to systematically
characterize the biophysical basis of RCI in the context of muscle degeneration and treatment response
and use it to identify optimal acquisition and analysis strategies for applying RCI in a clinical trial. In
preclinical rodent models of ALS, we will verify the association between RCI-based biomarkers and
pathologic markers of muscle architecture and establish the utility of RCI-based biomarkers to detect
response to therapy. In humans, we will characterize performance characteristics and repeatability of
RCI protocols in healthy controls and ALS patients. To further refine RCI, we will establish quality
control measures for RCI data acquisition and analysis and characterize age- and sex- dependent
reference intervals of RCI-based biomarkers in healthy controls. Finally, we will establish the sensitivity
of RCI-based biomarkers to disease progression in ALS patients and compare to other advanced
image-based biomarkers and routine clinical markers of disease status. Ultimately, RCI has the
potential to serve as a quantitative, myofiber-specific, image-based biomarker of early therapeutic
response for ALS, potentially enabling smaller sample sizes, earlier Go/No Go decisions, more cost-
effective clinical trials and, ultimately, improved patient care."

The cortex is the seat of conscious perception. Our goal is to test how the computations performed by specific cortical cell types lead to specific perceptual states. Here, we will use the mouse visual cortex to determine the cellular basis of contrast perception. Contrast is a fundamental stimulus property represented throughout the visual system and the gain control mechanisms thought to support contrast perception are disrupted in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, identifying the cell types that control contrast perception is a critical step in establishing the neural basis of perception in both health and disease. In our preliminary intracellular recordings from neurons in the visual cortex, we find that increases in contrast drive a transient increase in excitation followed by a prolonged suppression of network excitability. Our hypothesis is that this network suppression is a gain control mechanism that is under the control of local inhibitory interneurons, and is important for determining perceived contrast. Indeed, we find that during performance of a contrast discrimination task, the activation of either parvalbumin- (PV) or somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory interneurons is sufficient to decrease perceived contrast of stimuli represented by the manipulated hemisphere. To test under what conditions PV and SOM cells contribute to gain control and contrast perception we will use a combination of physiological and psychophysical measurements. In Aim 1, we will use whole-cell and extracellular recordings to determine the stimulus features (i.e. contrast and size) that drive the observed network suppression. Then we will use opto- and chemo- approaches to determine which inhibitory cell types are responsible for driving network suppression under each of these conditions. This will enable dissociation of the functional roles of PV and SOM cells in regulating cortical gain. In Aim 2 we will test the contribution of these cell types to perceived contrast by suppressing their activity during a contrast discrimination task. To establish a link between the circuit mechanisms defined in Aim 1 and the perceptual effects measured in Aim 2, we will incorporate the stimulus conditions that drive network suppression into our contrast discrimination task. This will allow us to compare manipulation of PV and SOM cells on both network suppression and perception across stimulus conditions. Together, these experiments will ascribe cortical computations and cell types to specific perceptual states. This would be a fundamental step in linking the activity of neurons to perception, and the basis for future investigations of the mechanisms of state-dependent sensory processing."
10754512,"Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) is a widely used therapy for a variety of malignant and
nonmalignant hematologic diseases. More than 8,500 patients, receive HCT transplants in the US each year.
Yet, up to 50% of patients suffer complications due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the first year after
HCT. GVHD occurs when donor immune cells attack the patient’s own tissues. GVHD can occur anywhere, with
the skin, gut and liver most frequently affected. GVHD remains one of the major barriers to a more widespread
application of allogeneic HCT.
Early diagnosis of aGVHD is critical to inform treatment decisions and prevent serious organ injury and death.
Unfortunately, few informative diagnostic approaches are available. In current clinical practice, diagnosis of
aGVHD relies almost entirely on the presence of clinical symptoms and requires confirmation via invasive biopsy
procedures, such as skin biopsy, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy or liver biopsy. HCT patients urgently need a
better alternative.
The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply a blood test to detect acute GVHD (aGVHD) and to
predict long-term HCT outcomes. This test employs genome-wide profiling of methylation marks comprised
within circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood to trace their tissues-of-origin, and to quantify tissue-specific
injury after HCT. This concept is supported by significant pilot data.
We will perform a retrospective study of the utility of cfDNA to stratify HCT recipients with single organ aGVHD
(Aim 1), and a prospective study of the utility of cfDNA to detect the early onset of GVHD and to predict HCT
risk (Aim 2). Together these aims explore the highly innovative concept that a measurement of the tissues-of-
origin of cfDNA in plasma enables to i) detect aGVHD, ii) quantify the severity of aGVHD and determine its organ
involvement, iii) predict post-HCT mortality, and iv) predict the outcome of aGVHD treatments.
This proposal directly addresses an urgent, unmet medical need: the early and noninvasive diagnosis of aGVHD
after HCT. These studies are therefore highly translational. A highly informative, noninvasive monitoring tool may
inform new treatment modalities and transplant strategies. Recognizing the limitations of universal prophylactic
therapy against aGVHD, cfDNA assays could find future use in guiding pre-emptive treatment strategies, thereby
reducing the need for prolonged immunosuppressive therapy after transplant. Furthermore, earlier detection of
aGVHD could lead to shorter durations of therapeutic immunosuppression and improved patient outcomes."

Having a stroke is a frightening experience for both the patient and their loved ones. A major source of anxiety
is not knowing what stroke-related deficits will persist – will my loved one ever be able to talk again? The
likelihood for recovery is estimated by the treating neurologist or rehabilitation specialist based on their
personal experience. There are no tools available that can use information about the location of the stroke,
query it against the outcomes from hundreds or thousands of other individuals, and generate a personalized
quantitative prediction of stroke-related deficits and prognosis for long-term recovery. Here, we propose to
develop such a tool. At the University of Iowa we have one of the most comprehensive lesion registries in the
world of some 3,500 patients with focal acquired brain lesions, neuroimaging, and extensive data on outcomes.
We propose to capitalize on this unique resource by developing a tool to predict cognitive outcomes from
stroke based on lesion location. First, we propose to map brain regions most associated with specific cognitive
deficits across over 1000 patients, including symptoms such as difficulty speaking or problems with attention.
Next, in a prospectively collected cohort with acute ischemic stroke we will attempt to predict cognitive
outcomes by querying lesion location against the aforementioned symptom ‘maps.’ We hypothesize that lesion
location will be a significant predictor of chronic cognitive outcomes. Second, we have recently developed an
innovative strategy that links lesion-associated deficits to specific brain networks. It combines traditional lesion
mapping with human connectome data from healthy adults to infer what networks are disrupted by focal brain
lesions. We will evaluate whether this lesion network mapping approach can be used to compliment the
traditional lesion mapping approach to predict additional variance in cognitive outcomes. Finally, we will use
advanced statistical modeling to evaluate how predictive information from lesion location can be optimally
integrated with demographic information and baseline screening cognitive performance to maximize
predictions of chronic cognitive outcomes in a longitudinal cohort. By addressing these objectives, we will lay
the foundation for developing a clinical tool that can be applied to a clinically-acquired MRI scan to aid in
determining the prognosis of cognitive outcomes, a key factor that will help in the early management,
rehabilitation, and life planning for patients with stroke."
10754520,"Background: Access to dermatology remains a significant problem in the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), particularly during the COVD-19 pandemic. To address this need, VA will deploy an asynchronous
teledermatology mobile app-My VA Images-which allows new dermatology patients to securely submit history
and photos of their skin for evaluation. The app may also eventually provide a conduit for patients to submit
skin images at will for analysis and triage by artificial intelligence (AI)-powered computer vision to a
dermatologist.
Significance: This project addresses the following gaps: 1) The impact of direct-to-patient teledermatology on
access to dermatology and on the satisfaction with such care by both patients and health care providers has
not been systematically studied; 2) Currently no AI-powered computer vision tool has been developed and
validated for patient-generated images; 3) The readiness of large healthcare organizations, such as VA, and
their stakeholders to engage in direct-to-patient teledermatology and AI is unknown.
Innovation and Impact: Two related innovations will be tested: 1) Direct-to-patient teledermatology for new
patients and 2) Evaluation of patient-submitted skin images by AI-powered computer vision. These separately
have the potential to transform remote access to expert skin care in VA and together are potentially synergistic.
At the conclusion of the project, we anticipate having a systematic understanding of how direct-to-patient
technologies perform and of the operational gaps that will need to be addressed by VA before these
technologies can be implemented enterprise-wide. The goal is to establish a critical scholarly and operational
foundation to safely move toward a transformative vision where Veterans will no longer be tied to a fixed time
and place for care, but instead will have the choice of self-directed, convenient and rapid access to expert-level
dermatology care wherever and whenever they need it.
Specific Aims: 1. Assess the impact of direct-to-patient teledermatology on access and health system
utilization. 2. Assess, refine and augment computer-assisted evaluation of patient-submitted images.
3. Assess readiness of VA and Veterans' acceptance to implement direct-to-patient care.
Methodology: Aim 1 will use a Type I hybrid pragmatic study design to compare the impact of the direct-to-
patient teledermatology intervention relative to usual in-person and usual consultative teledermatology
referrals, measuring access chiefly by data from VA's Central Data Warehouse. Aims 1 and 3 will measure
patient satisfaction and readiness for change using survey instruments and interviews. Aim 2 will include both
testing, training and refinement of the AI-powered computer vision and measure concordance with
dermatologists. Population: Veterans referred to Dermatology at three VA medical facilities. Intervention:
Eligible and medically appropriate patients will be offered the option to submit history and images to
Dermatology using the My VA Images app. Comparison: The intervention will be compared to usual care (in-
person and consultative teledermatology) groups. We will also compare two AI-powered computer vision
models with dermatologist diagnoses. Outcomes over a 5-year period: 1) Multiple measures of temporal and
geographic access to dermatologic care; 2) Patient satisfaction; 3) Concordance of AI with dermatologist
diagnoses; 4) Organizational and patient-readiness for remote and computer-assisted dermatologic care; and
5) Implementation and sustainability of the direct-to-new patient teledermatology process.
Next Steps/Implementation: Successful completion of the project will provide VA’s Office of Connected Care
and other offices tasked with enhancing access to specialty care with critical data that will justify further
expansion of the direct-to-patient asynchronous teledermatology program. The project will also provide VA
with critical data to evaluate the role of AI-powered computer vision in future remote care strategies."
10896391,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a debilitating gut disorder with significant morbidity and healthcare
resource utilization. Because early diagnosis and treatment may improve the prognosis of IBD, there is an
urgent need to better understand the preclinical incipient disturbance of gut microbe-epithelial homeostasis
in at-risk individuals to identify novel therapeutic targets to halt disease onset, which is our long-term objective.
A crucial host factor in maintaining a homeostatic relationship with the gut microbiota is Dual Oxidase 2
(DUOX2), an epithelial-specific NADPH oxidase releasing H2O2 into the supra-epithelial mucus layer. DUOX2
is highly inducible by abnormal microbial colonization and among the most robustly and consistently
overexpressed genes in mucosal biopsies from patients with preclinical IBD. We previously showed a defect
in DUOX2 leads to activation of compensatory epithelial defense systems in specific-pathogen-free mice and
loss-of-function alleles in human populations are associated with increased susceptibility to IBD. However,
the relevant mechanisms underlying this genetic association remain unclear. The objective here is to
determine how DUOX2 loss-of-function genetic variants render an individual susceptible to dysbiosis and a
loss of mucosal immune homeostasis leading to IBD. We hypothesize that dysregulation of IL-17C
signaling is a critical pathogenic driver of DUOX2-associated IBD. The rationale for the proposed
research is that, once it is known how dysregulation of IL-17C signaling in DUOX2 defective hosts contributes
to pathogenesis of IBD, novel strategies can be developed to identify at-risk individuals and restore
homeostasis to prevent the onset of IBD. We will test our hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish our objective
by pursuing the following specific aims: 1. Determine the mechanisms of how DUOX2 loss-of-function results
in microbe-dependent activation of the IL17C axis. 2. Assess the function of IL17RE-like protein, a hitherto
uncharacterized IBD risk factor. 3. Investigate the role of chronic IL-17C activation in DUOX2 defective hosts
as a driver of IBD pathogenesis. The expected outcome of the proposed work is a mechanistic framework of
how DUOX2 variants cause an increased risk for IBD, namely by sustained activation of IL17C-mediated
immune responses due to abnormal microbe-epithelial interactions. Such results are expected to have an
important positive impact because understanding how DUOX2 variants contribute to IBD pathogenesis is
highly likely to provide new targets for preventative and therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with
dysregulated microbe-intestinal interaction (e.g., IBD, IBS, colon cancer) in addition to fundamentally
advancing the fields of gut mucosal immunity."

This application seeks support to continue operations of the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) at the
University of Kentucky (UK). The AGSC is the only federally funded resource center that distributes Mexican
axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum), a salamander that provides living materials in support of biomedical
research nationally and internationally. Most notably, axolotls are unique among vertebrates in being able to
regenerate numerous tissues and body parts. These include the spinal cord, limbs, jaw, retina, brain, heart,
and tail, all of which can be regenerated at any point during embryonic, larval, and adult life. Also, axolotls are
used by researchers that work in additional areas, including neurobiology, ecotoxicology, development,
physiology, cell biology, genetics, genomics, and evolution. This is an exciting time for the axolotl as it’s
incredibly large genome (32 Gb) was recently sequenced and assembled. New and assessable resources are
allowing cutting edge technologies like gene-editing and single cell RNA sequencing to be performed for the
first time, approaches that are rapidly accelerating discoveries using axolotl models. In just the past 4 years,
NIH support for axolotl research has tripled and there has been a significant increase in transgenic and knock-
out lines in the community. PI’s in the salamander community recently came together to discuss future
opportunities and challenges, and the enabling role the AGSC will play in moving community efforts forward.
During the previous funding period, the AGSC moved internally from the College of Arts and Sciences to the
College of Medicine (COM) at UK. This move has strengthened the AGSC in several significant ways that
clearly demonstrate long term commitment by the host institution for this irreplaceable resource. Specifically,
funding was made available to replace re-circulating systems and create a more user friendly website to
facilitate axolotl stock purchasing and more efficiently disseminate information that is useful for working with
axolotls. Additionally, COM-UK has extensive experience working with university core research centers and
thus provides a more stable administrative environment to support AGSC business activities and to better
ensure regulatory compliance and animal health and welfare. Over the next 5 years, the AGSC will build upon
current momentum by maintaining and generating high quality, axolotl stocks that are needed by a growing
number of NIH-funded investigators. Husbandry and management practices will be modified to increase
availability of post-embryonic stocks that are seeing increasing demand by researchers. Also, transgenic and
knock-out stocks will be prioritized for import into the AGSC and cryopreservation methods will be developed to
preserve and more efficiently manage stocks. The AGSC will continue to serve as an informatics hub where
investigators obtain information about the collection, technical procedures, potential collaborators, and
research findings. Overall, the project will ensure distribution and long-term sustainability of axolotl resources
to NIH-funded investigators.

10788350,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death in the United States.
To address the magnitude of this problem, it is critically important to identify those at high risk for HCC and
institute effective surveillance strategies for early diagnosis. Liver cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCC. Bi-
annual ultrasound and α-fetoprotein remains the surveillance modality most frequently used in patients with
cirrhosis, despite very low sensitivity and specificity. Our goals are to identify a blood-based model for risk
stratification in patients with cirrhosis, as well as an integrated blood-based and liver imaging model to
optimize early HCC detection in high-risk patients. During the first grant period, we developed a multi-center
prospective cohort of patients with cirrhosis under contrast MRI surveillance. Such cohort provides a unique
opportunity to study blood biomarkers and imaging features on clinical material from patients rigorously
classified as having a very early disease in a surveillance setting. Longitudinal collection of paired blood
samples and MRIs from these patients is particularly valuable in assessing how early blood markers and
imaging features become positive during the period when lesions are observed to obtain a diagnosis of HCC.
To date, 912 cirrhotic patients have been enrolled and 2590 paired blood samples and MRIs have been
collected. During follow-up, 63 patients developed HCC and 212 patients had detectable lesion(s). In parallel,
we have identified in plasma and exosomes, proteins and metabolites for HCC risk prediction and early
detection. We also developed quantitative imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to analyze
imaging scans of patients with liver cancers. We demonstrated how voxel-wise enhancement pattern
mapping (EPM) can improve the contrast-to-noise ratio in CT scans. We extended this finding to MRIs for
patients with HCC, including patients in our prospective cohort. Differences in EPM signals from pre-
diagnostic MRIs to diagnostic MRIs may improve early detection and lesion characterization. Our AI-based
tools complement the EPM algorithm by providing high-throughput tools to process the thousands of MRIs
from our patient cohort in an efficient and accurate manner. In this competing renewal, we will extend the
existing cohort and further evaluate the performance of these novel blood and liver MRI markers. We will
determine longitudinal changes and evaluate their capacity to detect preclinical disease. We will identify the
panel of markers that best predict HCC development and that could therefore have utility in risk assessment
and early detection of HCC. This proposal achieves in one study two major goals: i) early detection and ii)
characterization of tumors when biomarker becomes positive. The impact is multiple: spare patients from
unnecessary imaging tests; identify high-risk patients and trigger the decision to perform MRI for surveillance
instead of ultrasound; detect lesions at an early stage allowing for curative treatment. Together, these clinical
applications would significantly reduce the cost of HCC surveillance and improve survival of HCC patients."
10788359,"Structural and functional changes in neural networks of attention and goal-directed cognition likely contribute to
age-related memory decline and impede daily living. While considerable progress has been made in specifying
how changes in the medial temporal lobe affect memory, moment-to-moment and individual differences in
attention and goal-state representation are also hypothesized to impact episodic encoding and retrieval in
young and older adults, and to contribute to age-related memory change. Of equal importance, in
asymptomatic (`healthy') older adults, preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology may disrupt attention and
goal coding, with deleterious consequences for memory. Here, we aim to use innovative functional,
molecular, and structural measures to characterize interactions between attention, goal states, and memory,
and to examine (a) their contributions to trial-level, subject-level, and group-level memory differences, and (b)
their relation to AD pathology. We will leverage goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval paradigms and
cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience tools, including task-based EEG-fMRI with pupillometry in asymptomatic
(`healthy') older (65-79 yrs) and young adults (18-30 yrs). Trial-level attentional lapses will be assayed via
fluctuations of alpha and theta oscillatory power and pupil diameter; the strength of trial-level goal states will be
quantified via multivariate analyses of frontoparietal BOLD patterns. Aims 1-2 will address: How do
interactions in attention and goal-state representation affect cortical and hippocampal mechanisms of episodic
encoding (Aim 1) and retrieval (Aim 2), and how do age-related changes in these interactions relate to
memory differences across age? Moreover, we will examine how molecular and structural biomarkers of
pathological aging (AD) in `healthy' older adults relate to neural, pupillometry, and behavioral assays of
attention, goal states, memory, and their interactions. Via PET-MR, we will measure (a) global β-amyloid (Aβ)
burden and regional Aβ in frontoparietal cortex, and (b) locus coeruleus integrity, a core structure for attention,
arousal, and goal-directed cognition, and an early site of AD pathology. Using categorical (Aβ+ vs. Aβ-) and
continuous analyses, Aim 3 will address: Do molecular and structural biomarkers of pathology in preclinical
aging predict differences in attentional lapses and goal coding, accounting for significant shared or unique
variance in behavioral and neural measures of memory in asymptomatic individuals? The promise, feasibility,
and novelty of the proposed research are grounded in strong preliminary data and derive from the use
of multi-modal measures to discover how function, structure, and early pathology interact to affect
attention, goal coding, and memory in aging. The project will advance understanding of (a) how moment-to-
moment and individual differences in attention and goal coding affect learning and remembering in young and
older adults, and (b) how these differences relate to memory decline in aging with and without AD pathology.
The latter holds promise for revealing novel neurocognitive biomarkers of AD risk."

 There is an urgent need for development of metabolic imaging methods that are sensitive to nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and to the transition linking the two
pathophysiological states. We will develop magnetic resonance based metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized
13C and thermally polarized 2H-labeled substrates. Our testbed is the C57Bl/6N mouse, and diet induced and
genetic models of the disease states. The approach assays both carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism,
which are known to be altered in these diseases. Aim 1. Using hyperpolarized [1-13C] and [2-13C]pyruvate and
[2-13C]dihydroxyacetone, we will produce a multi-parametric assessment of hepatic pyruvate oxidation and
anaplerosis, as well as pyruvate cycling. Aim 2. Using uniformly deuterated fatty acids, we will determine rates
of β-oxidation and changes in redox biology in the same models. The combination of these approaches will
yield the most comprehensive analysis of energy metabolism to date in these well-accepted models of the
human disease. Aim 3. We will confirm both carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism imaging assays using
knock out mice that test the assumptions underlying our paradigms. The pyruvate carboxylase knockout
mouse downregulates pyruvate anaplerosis. The fumarate hydratase knockout mouse is a model of
downregulated metabolism that will test our sensitivity to changes in Krebs cycle turnover. The acetyl-CoA
carboxylase knockout mouse will upregulate fatty acid oxidation. All three pathways have been hypothesized
as essential elements of the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD and NASH.
Relevance
 NAFLD and NASH are now a worldwide epidemic, with some estimates of NAFLD prevalence as high as
24% of the world population. NASH is expected to surpass hepatitis as the number one cause of liver
transplant in the United States within the next 5 years. Over the next 10 years, this disease is projected to be a
1 trillion dollar burden to the healthcare system. While imaging of fibrosis is somewhat diagnostic of NASH
progression, there is no metabolic imaging technique that is sensitive to the inflammation endemic to the
transition of NAFLD to NASH. Current stepwise paradigms for identifying NASH lack the sensitivity to correctly
classify early development. When NASH is diagnosed, clinical management of the disease changes
dramatically, becoming much more expensive. Development of a metabolic imaging method for diagnosis and
staging of NASH would significantly enhance healthcare practice, with prospects for improving patient care and
decreasing costs."
10788452,"This new D43 application proposes a training program entitled “Strengthening Research Capacity in
Innovative Global Health Technologies for Non-Communicable Diseases in Uganda” (SIGHT). This
program will build on the extensive 32-year training record of the Uganda-CWRU Research Collaboration
(UCRC), a partnership between Case Western Reserve University and Makerere University
 The burden of non-communicable diseases and disorders (NCD) is growing rapidly in low- and middle-
income countries (LMIC) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Uganda particularly. Developing capacity for
biomedical research in LMICs is necessary for managing these new healthcare challenges, and encouraging
progress is being made. We assert that building capacity in particular for biomedical engineering (BME)
research is critical to development of much-needed screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic technology relevant
to the context of LMICs. Training programs to build this capacity are lacking.
 We have identified three broad categories of NCDs to target in the SIGHT program that will particularly
benefit from building capacity for technology innovation: cardiovascular disease, blood disorders, and
chronic movement disorders. These target areas have been identified as critical public health needs by
program leaders and other stakeholders. We have also identified four areas of technology focus as highest
priorities for building capacity in BME research expertise at MU in Uganda. These are: biomaterials and drug
delivery, point-of-care diagnostics, biomedical imaging, and data analytics and artificial intelligence.
These technology tools are cross-cutting in their potential to address high-priority NCD healthcare needs.
 The SIGHT program has been designed with the long-term goal of building and strengthening the
capacity of academic, public, private, and NGO institutions in Uganda to conduct biomedical engineering
research, train biomedical engineers up to a PhD level and grow a local biomedical engineering industry based
on local needs. SIGHT aims to contribute to this goal by:
Aim 1: Training Ugandan students in the BME Ph.D. program at CWRU (6 within the proposed project period)
Aim 2: Supporting research projects for M.S. students at MU in BME-adjacent fields (approx. 10 per year).
Aim 3: Providing opportunities for MU investigators to enhance their research experience and expertise.
Expected outcomes of the SIGHT program include:
 ● Ph.D. researchers prepared to fill faculty and research positions at research institutions in Uganda.
 ● M.S. graduates who are prepared to fill research positions or go on to Ph.D. training.
 ● MU investigators who are better prepared to carry out high quality BME research.
 ● A robust network of research collaborations between BME and clinical investigators at CWRU and MU.
 ● Increased research output, including publications in peer reviewed journals and grant proposals."
10930905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Evidence-based intervention strategies are needed to address one of the most pernicious, yet least addressed,
barriers to recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD): social isolation. People with OUD are trapped in a deadly
cycle wherein opioid use leads to social isolation, and social isolation leads to increased risk of continued opioid
use and overdose. Disclosure, which involves sharing information about one’s OUD history and/or treatment with
others, can help to break this cycle by acting as a gateway to (re-)establishing social connection as individuals
enter and engage in OUD treatment. Yet, disclosure is a challenging and high-stakes social process. It is
challenging because it involves a series of decisions (including whether, why, what, how, and when to disclose)
and requires an advanced skillset (including communication, de-escalation, and coping skills). It is high stakes
because it sometimes leads to stigma and further social isolation, undermining recovery. Although there are
numerous evidence-based interventions to support disclosure among people with other stigmatized chronic
illnesses, none are currently available for people in OUD treatment. We have developed Disclosing Recovery: A
Decision Aid and Toolkit, which is a brief, one-hour disclosure intervention designed to help people in treatment
for OUD make key decisions regarding disclosure and build disclosure skills. We pilot tested Disclosing Recovery
with 50 people in treatment for OUD. Participants randomly assigned to Disclosing Recovery perceived the
intervention to be acceptable and feasible, and reported better decision-making quality than participants in the
comparator condition. Moreover, Disclosing Recovery impacted disclosure rates and led to greater relationship
closeness. In this Phase II efficacy study, we propose to test whether Disclosing Recovery results in improved
treatment- and recovery-related outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. We will randomize n=480
participants in treatment for OUD to Disclosing Recovery versus a waitlist comparator condition. We will abstract
data from participants’ medical records and administer surveys every 3 months to examine the efficacy as well
as potential mediators and moderators of the intervention. Our specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate whether
participants randomly assigned to the Disclosing Recovery intervention versus a waitlist comparator condition
experience improved treatment- and recovery-related outcomes; (2) Test whether changes in key relationship
outcomes and/or social isolation mediate intervention effects (or non-effects); (3) Determine whether profiles of
recovery characteristics, disclosure goals, and relationship characteristics moderate intervention effects (or non-
effects). The intervention will be tested in Delaware, the state with the third-highest overdose death rate in the
United States. If we find that the Disclosing Recovery intervention is efficacious, we will follow recommendations
of the NIH Phase Model for Behavioral Intervention Development by progressing to real-world efficacy and/or
implementation testing. By helping people (re-)establish social connections during OUD treatment, this line of
research will ultimately contribute to breaking the deadly cycle of social isolation and opioid use."

Genetic variation is the central component of all major evolutionary processes. Differences among individuals’
genomes contribute to phenotypic variation including disease susceptibility and the evolution of adaptation.
The exceptional growth in genome sequencing technologies and concomitant acceleration in the development
of bioinformatic software has the potential to address longstanding questions about the evolution of genomes.
Our lab will continue to lead this scientific endeavor by developing a range of statistical, computational, and
experimental techniques. In particular, we will develop uniquely scalable computational methods to infer and to
understand the relationships among densely sampled populations such as SARS-CoV-2. We will develop
computational techniques to study adaptation and the underpinning of genetic isolation using genomes from
admixed populations. Our group will leverage an established genome engineering technique to rearrange parts
of genomes that have remained structurally static for more than 100 million years and to determine what
molecular and fitness effects underlie this maintenance. Finally, our team will leverage natural variation in
intron abundance to determine the molecular consequences and fitness impacts of massive intron gain.
Results from this work have profound implications for understanding the origins, effects, and ultimate
consequences of genetic variation on evolutionary outcomes in natural populations."
10764960,"Project Summary / Abstract
Under present R01 funding, the Sauter group has focused on the use of serial crystallography to discover the
structure-function relationships of large biomolecules. While specializing in technology related to data analysis,
we have enabled new science at X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) lightsources, where the X-ray pulse structure
permits time resolution down to picoseconds, at normal physiological temperature where the full range of
available molecular conformations can be revealed, and with essentially no radiation damage, ideal for
studying metalloenzymes in their functional redox states. Our software CCTBX.XFEL gives a workflow to
process big data up to 100 Terabytes on supercomputing platforms, while applying algorithms that are
customized for the “still shots” of serial crystallography, distinct from the rotating crystal geometry used at
synchrotron sources. Considering the enormous cost of XFEL crystallography in terms of labor and competitive
beamtime allocation, the 10 minute turnaround time of our pipeline affords a significant mitigation of the risks,
allowing the experimental team to adjust data collection parameters and reprioritize samples. We have
collaborated on the development of new instrumentation to observe enzymatic reaction progress triggered by
laser pump, mix-and-inject, or gas incubation. We’ve implemented new serial crystallography modalities such
as X-ray emission spectroscopy to monitor catalytic metal sites, and chemical crystallography to determine
small molecule structures. Under the proposed R35, the goal is to gain greater detail in the molecular model,
in comparison to present results. There is potential for improvement because today’s algorithms still inherit
assumptions from traditional crystallography (such as monochromatic beam), while the plan is to introduce a
new Bayesian inference model, accounting for every detail of the diffraction pattern down to the pixel level. We
will also develop the related capability of using the protein crystal as an X-ray spectrometer, thus revealing
detail about the electronic environment of catalytic metals (using X-rays tuned to the metal absorption edge), a
measurement that has not yet been achieved at ambient temperatures or in the time domain. Our goals also
include the observation of diffuse scatter (diffraction intensity between the lattice of Bragg spots), which reflects
correlated motions within and between protein molecules, and further to probe macromolecule flexibility by
infrared beam temperature-jump experiments. Finally, we hope to explore new computational directions for
high-throughput interpretation of cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) data. The unifying theme between serial
crystallography and cryoET is the desire to learn the biological role of structural variability. The X-ray data
processing improvements will allow us to model the small changes that contribute to a reaction mechanism,
e.g., an amino acid sidechain rotation, a change in water occupancy, or even the displacement of a single
electron. High-throughput cryoET will sample the variability and heterogeneity of cellular structures, giving a
spatiotemporal understanding of living systems and how they respond to genes, regulation and environment."
10764964,"A major focus of our laboratory is to broadly understand the molecular mechanisms by which cell wall-
anchored (CWA) proteins on the surface of Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus promote biofilm
formation and virulence. Staphylococcal biofilms are highly adhesive and cohesive communities of surface-
adherent bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotic action and host immune responses, often resulting in
recalcitrant infections. Specifically, the research will focus on the large, multi-domain CWA protein Aap from S.
epidermidis, its ortholog SasG from S. aureus, and another large S. aureus CWA protein called SasC; each of
these is known to mediate homophilic interactions that promote intercellular adhesion. Mechanisms of both
reversible self-assembly and nucleation of functional amyloid fibrils will be studied in order to identify avenues
for therapeutic intervention to prevent biofilm formation. In addition, the small, secreted S. epidermidis protein
SBP and its ortholog from S. aureus will be investigated in terms of their ability to interact with Aap (and SasG)
to facilitate assembly and potentially trigger liquid-liquid phase separation of macromolecular components in
the biofilm matrix. Finally, the S. aureus protein SasX, implicated in the spread of a recent epidemic of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus, is also cell wall-anchored but unlike the other CWA proteins is a small,
intrinsically disordered protein. SasX will be assessed for its ability to interact with other staphylococcal surface
proteins as well as keratinocyte ligands, given its demonstrated role in promoting biofilm formation as well as
facilitating adhesion to epithelial cells and nasal colonization. In addition to structural and biophysical studies of
these proteins, quantitative analysis of biofilm morphology and mechanical properties using confocal
microscopy, rheometry, and force spectroscopy will provide complementary insights in a biological context.
Over the next five years, our goal is to provide a structural and functional view of how the most important
surface proteins in S. aureus and S. epidermidis physically hold the cells together in biofilms and to understand
how those protein-protein interactions mechanically strengthen the biofilm. By understanding these interactions
at the molecular level, our goal is to identify sites of vulnerability that will allow the design of therapeutic
approaches to target the ability of these bacteria to form biofilms, rendering them susceptible to a broader
range of antimicrobial agents."

Autophagy is used by all cells to deliver cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for degradation.
Significantly, autophagy has been implicated in several human diseases, including inflammatory
disorders, cancer and neurodegeneration. Most of what we know about the regulation of
autophagy is based on pioneering studies in yeast that defined the core autophagy machinery,
but recent studies in animals have revealed that autophagy can possess different regulatory
mechanisms in distinct cell types. Our research program aims to understand how autophagy is
regulated under physiological conditions, and here we investigate developmentally programmed
autophagy in the Drosophila intestine. This system possesses several advantages for these
studies, including robust genetic, genomic and cell biological tools that enable sophisticated
cellular analyses at single cell resolution. We have focused on studying autophagy in midgut
enterocyte cells of the intestine as a model. Developing midgut cells require autophagy for
proper cell death and degradation. Importantly, these cells are the only existing model to study
how distinct cargoes, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are selectively
cleared by autophagy within a single cell in a physiological context. Our future research program
contains 4 projects that will address key questions in the autophagy field, with a specific focus
on how specific organelle cargoes are distinguished and selected for autophagy. What genes
regulate mitochondrial clearance by autophagy? What genes are required for clearance of
endoplasmic reticulum by autophagy? Are mitochondrial and ER cargoes differentially selected
for autophagic clearance within a single cell during development? What genes and mechanisms
control endosome-dependent and Atg gene-independent pathway for the clearance of ER?
These proposed studies will address a critical gap in our knowledge about the cell context-
specific mechanisms that regulate autophagy and cargo recruitment within a developing animal.
Given the strong conservation of autophagy mechanisms between Drosophila and mammals,
we expect that what we discover will provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms that control
autophagy in humans, and how alterations in autophagy in different cell contexts may lead to
disease. Furthermore, an understanding of the diversity of mechanisms that control autophagy
in animals is essential knowledge for the design of rationale strategies to target autophagy for
disease therapies."

10767239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This research addresses concerns in an NIH PAR, “Emotional Function in Normal Aging and/or MCI and
AD/ADRD”. It expands on foundational research in order to clarify the trajectories of change in emotional
processing and linked neurobiological factors in adults who are aging normally, as well as in individuals with
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Its goals focus on 1) normative maturational
shifts in emotional processing, and 2) how dysfunction in the integrative neural-behavioral mechanisms of
emotional function manifest in MCI and the early stages of AD/ADRD. We propose to study brain Event-
Related Potentials (ERPs) in the context of affective processing of word stimuli based on the classic,
quantitative three-dimensional theory of affective (emotional) meaning developed by C.E. Osgood. Can the
emotional changes which accompany aging be elucidated by brain ERPs measured during processing of
affective word stimuli? What are the relationships among our ERP and behavioral measures and our
neuropsychological measures of cognitive ability and neuropsychiatric assessments of affect and emotion?
These questions will be studied in young adults, in elderly with normal cognition, and in like-aged individuals
afflicted with MCI and early-stage AD. In addition, we will examine how affective meaning in ERPs change in
MCI/early-stage AD when compared with like-aged normal elderly. Also studied will be the effects of gender
differences on affective meaning ERP measures both in the aging analyses and the cognitive impairment
analyses of MCI/AD. Our experimental design builds on a strong, empirically-supported framework of affective
processing and emphasizes the affective differences within Osgood’s model. Multivariate analysis methods
will be utilized, including separately studying combinations of ERP components related to particular
connotative word classes for men and for women."
10767276,"In recent years there has been much excitement about genetically encoded fluorescent indicators of neural
activity, with new molecules such as the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 being used to image
the activity of many neurons at once in living brains. However, such indicators are slow, raising the question of
whether voltage indicators will become useful enough to be widespread in neuroscience. Furthermore, imaging
of axons and dendrites remains difficult, especially in densely expressing tissues. For example, when neurons
express such reporters densely, axons and dendrites within the diffraction limit of light will have their signals
mixed, so that the signals of individual neural processes cannot be resolved. How can we push the
spatiotemporal performance of neural activity imaging to the specifications desired by neuroscientists – down to
the millisecond timescale, and down to the sub-micron scale axonal and dendritic parts of neurons? We here
propose to address this problem through molecular engineering, guided by in vivo imaging constraints. To
address the spatial dimension: if neural activity indicators could be safely clustered into discrete, bright puncta
that, even when expressed in all the cells of a neural circuit, are separated from one another by a distance
greater than the diffraction limit of the imaging system, then these puncta could cleanly be imaged, and used to
sample activity along axons and dendrites of the neurons in a circuit. In this grant, we will (Aim 1) create and
validate this strategy, which we call stochastic arrangement of reagents in clusters (STARC). In this way, we
will effectively point the way towards circuit-wide neural activity imaging that allows for the investigation of axonal
signaling and dendritic processing, and not only cell body imaging. To address the temporal dimension: we will
create optimized fluorescent voltage indicators (Aim 2). Pioneering efforts have resulted in fluorescent voltage
indicators, but their performance is often poor when utilized in the brain, because of poor trafficking and
membrane localization that manifests in vivo, since neurons in vivo are different from the cultured cells used to
screen for the voltage sensors. We will conduct an in situ screen to directly identify fluorescent voltage indicators
that work well in neurons in intact mouse brain circuits, by virally expressing members of a library of mutant
voltage indicators directly in the mouse brain, imaging the responses with single cell resolution in mouse brain
slices, and then directly reading out the mutations that yielded the voltage indicators that best perform in actual
brain circuits, validating the resultant indicators in the mouse brain. We will also create (Aim 3) STARC forms
of voltage sensors, since the proximity issues discussed in Aim 1 are even more severe when a neural activity
reporter is on a neural membrane that is in close proximity to other membranes. We will close the loop by testing
all such indicators in vivo and then iterating on the molecular engineering, delivering to the neuroscience
community a powerful, simple-to-use toolbox that can be rapidly deployed for ultraprecise – across both space
(via STARC) and time (via in situ optimized voltage indicators) -- neural activity imaging."
10767280,"SUMMARY: This is an application for NIH support to enable an Open Label Extension (OLE) of the Anti-
Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (A4) Study. The A4 Study was launched in 2014 as
the first of its kind secondary prevention trial in clinically normal (CN) older individuals with evidence of
elevated amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation on screening PET scan. A4 eligible participants are in the preclinical
(asymptomatic) stages of AD and at high risk for cognitive decline. The overall goal of the A4 study is to test
the hypothesis that immunotherapy targeting Aβ (solanezumab) can prevent the cognitive decline associated
with early AD pathology, if initiated early enough. The A4 Study screened over 6700 participants (age 65-85,
14% minority) and exceeded our enrollment target with 1169 participants randomized. Our initial prediction of
30% “amyloid positivity” was proven correct with 29.5% of the participants with screening PET meeting
“elevated amyloid” criteria. We also launched the companion Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and
Neurodegeneration (LEARN) observational study in “amyloid negative” CN (n=541) in 2015. Based on the sola
trial results in AD dementia, we quadrupled the dose and extended the double-blind (DB) protocol to 4.5 years.
The first A4 participant will complete the DB protocol in early 2019, with the last participant completing in mid-
2022. Maintaining the blind of the initial treatment assignment, the A4 OLE will enable us to continue to assess
these participants after they complete the DB, and to investigate the long-term effects of sola exposure on
cognitive and functional decline in preclinical AD. In addition, we will explore the “critical window” for optimal
response to anti-Aβ therapy utilizing amyloid PET, MRI, and tau PET (in a subset) acquired at start of OLE.
The A4 Study is a public-private-philanthropic partnership with funding from NIA, Lilly, Alzheimer’s Association,
Fidelity Biosciences, GHR Foundation, and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP). Here we seek
partial funding from the NIH for the A4 OLE with Lilly providing the remainder of funding and in-kind support.
This funding will allow us to offer all of the very dedicated A4 participants access to study drug in the OLE, and
continue to collect extremely valuable longitudinal data on the largest available cohort of CN characterized by
amyloid status, until the primary efficacy analyses are completed in late 2022. We have already begun to share
the data and biosamples from the A4 screening data, and the A4/LEARN longitudinal data will be made
publicly available within one year of completion of the primary efficacy analyses of the A4 Study. The A4 Study
is well positioned to rigorously test the amyloid hypothesis with a higher dose of solanezumab and at the
appropriate stage of disease, in a population estimated to be up to 15 years earlier in the Aβ accumulation
process than the previous AD dementia trials. The additional longitudinal data from the A4 Study, in
combination with similar data acquired in LEARN, has the potential to fundamentally alter the detection and
treatment of AD, and move us closer to the NAPA goal of finding a successful prevention therapy by 2025."
10778812,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Very preterm survivors continue to experience high rates of neurodevelopmental impairment (up to ~60%) after
discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These impairments lead to significant burden for
individuals, communities, and society, as translate to high rates of special education in school, social and mental
health difficulties, and reduced employment potential in adulthood. As primary prevention of preterm birth is
presently infeasible, it is imperative to prioritize early interventions to mitigate adverse long-term effects of very
preterm birth on child and family outcomes. One critical window for intervention is the third trimester of gestation,
during which the preterm brain volume quadruples in size and is highly sensitive to positive and negative
environmental experiences. This is a time very preterm infants spend in the NICU, frequently exposed to atypical
sensory experiences (loud alarms, noise, pain) and a paucity of human interaction. Enriching experiences in the
NICU during this key period can lead to exponential downstream effects on infant neurodevelopment. Music-
based interventions (MBI) have been recently studied as enriching interventions for hospitalized infants.
However, evidence from existing studies lacks rigor due to small sample sizes, study design limitations (mostly
observational), and outcomes focused on short-term associations without mechanistic investigation and long-
term follow-up. To fill this gap, we propose a rigorous, two-center randomized controlled trial (RCT), employing
a novel MBI tailored based on preliminary data and inclusive of evidence-based musical elements with layered
parent voice to facilitate engagement. The MBI will be delivered on average 5 days/week between 32-40 weeks
gestation (or discharge), followed by comprehensive evaluation of relevant clinical, neuroimaging, and
neurodevelopmental outcomes during the NICU stay and up to 2 years of age. Outcomes will include assessment
of acute (physiologic and behavioral) and cumulative stress (amygdala volume on term-equivalent brain
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and telomere length) in the NICU, intranetwork connectivity in key networks
(language and salience) on term MRI along with investigation of other relevant regions of interest and
internetwork connectivity, and comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment of language, cognition,
behavior, social emotional, and family functioning at 2 years' corrected age. Our overarching goal is to improve
long-term neuro-developmental outcomes of very preterm infants through leveraging music medicine as an
evidence-based innovation in the NICU. This work has the potential to benefit over 63,000 very preterm infants
born each year in the U.S. and many more worldwide."

10815826,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to significant HIV suppression and improvement in
immune function, persistent viral reservoirs remain that are refractory to intensified antiviral therapy. However,
ART poses many challenges such as adherence to drug regimens, the emergence of resistant virus, and
cumulative toxicity as a result of long-term therapy. Moreover, these viral reservoirs directly or indirectly
contribute to the rapid viral rebound that typically occurs within 2 weeks after cessation of ART. Thus, lifelong
ART is required for continued viral suppression. Therefore, we need an effective approach that will eliminate HIV
from viral reservoirs in individuals on suppressive ART. A number of novel far-reaching and varied therapeutic
options are currently under investigation to address this concern, the most common of which is to eliminate the
persistent CD4+ T cell viral reservoir. However, although latently infected CD4+ T cells are the predominant HIV
reservoir, other cell types, such as macrophages and microglia also serve as sites of HIV persistence. These
long-lived cells are resistance to the cytopathic effects of HIV and support persistent permissive HIV infection in
the absence of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, they are resistant to CD8+ T cell-mediated killing. Therefore, we need
an effective approach that will also eliminate HIV from these viral reservoirs in individuals on suppressive ART.
However, in order to do this, it is essential that we understand how macrophage and microglia resist viral
cytopathogenesis. Our preliminary data show that macrophages, in response to productive HIV infection,
upregulate the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells-1 (TREM1), and that silencing or inhibition of these proteins promotes the selective death of HIV-infected
cells without increasing viral replication. This suggests that (i) IAPs and TREM1 are responsible for myeloid cell
resistance to HIV cytopathogenesis; and (ii) IAPs and TREM1 represent novel targets for the elimination of HIV.
We therefore propose an innovative research program to: (i) conduct detailed mechanistic studies aimed at
understanding how HIV-infected microglia resist viral cytopathogenesis with a focus on IAPs and TREM1; and (ii)
identify new drug candidates that capitalize on these findings to reverse resistance and induce apoptosis of HIV-
infected microglia without killing uninfected microglia. These studies are thus aimed at finding new effective
approaches to curing HIV infection by eliminating persistent HIV infection from the myeloid reservoirs in ART-
treated patients. This approach is fundamentally different from traditional strategies that target the virus itself,
and we expect it to be complementary with ART. We also expect that the results from this work can be translated
quickly into interventions aimed at eradicating HIV infection."
10929428,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given their physiochemical properties, medications and dietary supplements often require active transport using
solute carriers (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to cross trophoblast barriers. These same
transporters are also involved in the delivery of nutrients to the fetus and one unintentional consequence of drug
therapy during pregnancy can be disruption of these shared systems. Therefore, understanding the interplay
between SLC and ABC transporters in the placental disposition of drugs and nutrients is one key step to optimizing
therapeutic interventions that improve perinatal healthcare. Our research team has championed the advancement
of novel approaches to study SLC and ABC transporters in the placenta. To expand these efforts, we have created
the Integrated Transporter Elucidation Center (InTEC) which leverages translational research expertise across 4
academic institutions. Our central hypothesis is that novel regulation and functions of placental transporters
can be elucidated using integrated experimental, epidemiological, and modeling approaches. Together,
data and models generated can predict the placental disposition of therapeutics and nutrients and their
subsequent effects on fetal development. To accomplish this goal, we will 1) identify critical factors that regulate
placental transporters using state-of-the-art quantitative targeted absolute proteomics and genetics in a US-based
birth cohort; 2) develop a novel computational modeling framework that predicts maternal-fetal chemical disposition
according to placental transporter functions and regulation; and 3) evaluate SLC and ABC transport in novel
placenta-on-a-chip microphysiological systems. We will test nutrients, supplements, drugs, and toxicants as
substrates and inhibitors of placental transporters. InTEC will enable rapid acceleration of placenta transporter
research and establish best practices for transporter biology. Resources and datasets will be disseminated via our
CIIPro webportal created in 2017. Unique training opportunities will be provided to early career scientists
(undergraduate students, MS/MPH/PhD students, and postdoc fellows) and clinicians (obstetrics residents and
fellows) at the intersections of pharmacology, computational biology, public health, maternal-fetal medicine, and
biomedical engineering. Through innovative research and training, InTEC will lead to novel breakthroughs in the
field of placental transport and ensure a well-trained workforce to improve maternal and perinatal health."
10779400,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) is one of the most challenging subtypes of ovarian cancer (OVCA) to treat,
as it is resistant to standard chemotherapy and is associated with poor outcomes. CCOCs likely arise from
endometriosis, supporting their unique molecular landscape with ARID1A-inactivating mutations (ARID1Amut)
being the most prevalent (50%). Our proposed research capitalizes on the high prevalence of ARID1Amut in
CCOC using a novel synthetic lethal approach to provide a new treatment option for patients addressing a
clinically unmet need. Our preliminary data shows that ARID1A loss sensitizes CCOC tumors to combination
ATR and BET family protein inhibition (ATRi-BETi). ATRi-BETi treatment is synergistic in killing CCOC cells and
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, compared to monotherapies in an ARID1A-dependent manner. These
results have led to a Phase IB investigator-initiated clinical trial that will be run through the NRG cooperative
clinical trials group evaluating next-generation ATRi (M1774) and BETi (ZEN-3694) in recurrent CCOC.
 The overarching goals of the research proposed herein are to develop ARID1A as a biomarker for ATRi-
BETi treatment and to identify new functionally relevant biomarkers that will facilitate patient selection for this
therapy for CCOC in future clinical trials. These goals will be realized through the use of human samples collected
from this clinical trial complemented by the use of CCOC PDX models and response data, which will be employed
to validate ARID1Amut as a predictive biomarker of response and help identify novel biomarkers that further
enhance the effectiveness of this combination. Novel predictive biomarkers will be identified using a multi-
dimensional molecular profiling approach that integrates: 1) mutations and gene expression alterations that
correlate with responsiveness in humans and animal models as determined by computational modeling; and 2)
factors that impact the response to drug treatment at the molecular site of BETi-ATRi action, the genome, and
the DNA replication fork. This approach is designed to discover mechanistically relevant biomarkers that predict
response to therapy. Our overarching hypothesis is that ARID1Amut and additional molecular alterations will serve
as biomarkers of response to ATRi-BETi in CCOC. In summary, these proposed studies will: 1) provide a new
treatment option for CCOC addressing a clinically unmet need; 2) determine if ARID1A loss is a biomarker of
response to ATRi-BETi; and 3) identify additional mechanistically relevant biomarkers of response to guide future
clinical trials."
10931527,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immuno-oncology (IO) therapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as nivolumab (anti-PD-
1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) have made rapid advances in inducing remarkable response rates in patients
in a variety of solid tumors. However, over 40% of melanoma patients develop secondary resistance to aPD-1-
based therapy, and have limited treatment options.
Integrins α4β1 and αLβ2 are crucial for antigen presentation, T cell priming and trafficking. 7HP349 is an oral
allosteric agonist of α4β1 and αLβ2 integrins, that may potentially reverse anti-PD-1 resistance and increase ICI
effectiveness in these patients, without elevating toxicity. 7HP349 shows augmented T cell activity in vitro, and
enhanced antitumor efficacy and survival in tumor models, with increased T cell infiltration into tumors but not
to normal tissues. We have made significant progress with 7HP349 development, including approval of Orphan
Drug Designation (ODD) and Fast-Track Designation for melanoma, and completion of a first-in-human (FIH)
Phase I study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 7HP349, with the optimal pharmacokinetic dose
(OPD) defined for Phase Ib/IIa.
Our hypothesis is that the augmentation of T cell responses with a standard regimen of ipilimumab in
combination with 7HP349, followed by a maintenance regimen of nivolumab monotherapy will improve
responses without added toxicity in solid tumor patients with secondary aPD-1 resistance. Here we propose a
Phase Ib dose escalation study (7HP-111a) with 7HP349 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of 7HP349 in
combination with ipilimumab followed sequentially by nivolumab monotherapy in solid tumor patients
(melanoma, pleural mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, MSI-high or mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
genomic tumor aberrations) who have secondary aPD-1 resistance. T cell activation studies will also be
performed on patient samples, and biopsies collected as part of this study. The proposed Phase Ib study will not
only enable the subsequent design and conduct of a future Phase IIa dose expansion study to evaluate the
preliminary efficacy of 7HP349 in combination with ipilimumab followed sequentially by nivolumab monotherapy
in melanoma patients with secondary resistance to aPD-1 therapy, but potentially lay the foundation for novel
treatment options in such patients."
10886827,"Summary
Despite the vast knowledge of the structure and mechanical function of mature tendons, the understanding of
tenogenic cell differentiation during development and how cell types from non-tenogenic origins, such as
macrophages, influence tenogenesis is limited. Tissue resident macrophages play key roles in the development
of several tissues and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling is essential for their differentiation
and survival. The source of ligands that act on CSF1R (CSF1 being the most common) often originate from
adjacent resident cells. In addition to CSF1R signaling acting on the macrophages, macrophages often produce
trophic factors that act on the adjacent resident cells to regulate aspects of tissue development. In exciting new
data, we demonstrate that CSF1R-expressing resident macrophages are situated adjacent to CSF1-expressing
tenocytes within linear arrays in the tendon fascicle from initial formation (E15.5) into adulthood, these resident
macrophages rapidly accumulate to nearly 10% of the total cell population within tendons during early postnatal
growth, and CSF1 produced by tenogenic cells is required for their survival. Additionally, these macrophages
internalize collagen in situ, which may indicate a potential role in matrix remodeling during growth and
development. Despite their relative abundance and presumed communication with adjacent tenocytes, our
limited understanding of the role of resident macrophages in tendon growth and development and potential
trophic signaling to tenocytes are significant gaps in knowledge. As macrophages are critical to the development
and repair of numerous tissues, defining their role in tendon development will provide insight into signaling
mechanisms that could be leveraged in future therapies to improve repair outcomes, which is an unmet clinical
need. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal will define the ontogeny, distribution, and phenotypic
profile of resident macrophages and establish their cross-talk with tenocytes to regulate tendon formation during
growth and development. Our central hypothesis is that stable macrophage-tenocyte cross-talk exists and this
communication is necessary for tendon formation. Aim 1 will define the ontogeny, abundance, and distribution
of resident macrophages with respect to Csf1-expressing tenocytes and the phenotypic profile of these cells at
multiple stages of growth and development. Aim 2 will then establish the cross-talk between macrophages and
adjacent tenocytes and its role in tendon formation and growth. In this proposal, we will elucidate the importance
of stable macrophage-tenocyte cross-talk in promoting cell differentiation and tendon formation in growth and
development, thus providing new and critical insight to tendon cell biology that will inform future regenerative
strategies."
10878896,"Project Summary
 Sexual minorities have significantly greater risk for obesity, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and some cancers compared to heterosexuals. A key driver of these health disparities is chronic stress related
to stigmatization. Compounding this, racial and ethnic sexual minorities have complex intersecting identities
and experiences of stress that may exacerbate negative health outcomes relative to non-Hispanic White
sexual minorities. Chronic stressors can affect the immune system by both increasing inflammation and
impairing cellular immunity, a pattern causally predictive of risk for acute illness, chronic disease, and mortality.
 Funded by NICHD and fielded during the pandemic, the National Couples’ Health and Time Study
(NCHAT) includes 5,157 US adults 18-60 years of age, with oversamples of Black, Latinx, and Asian
individuals. With 2,230 (43.2%) identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or other identifies, NCHAT is the only
population-representative study with a fully-powered subsample of sexual minorities in the US. Capitalizing on
the extraordinary opportunity to address the empirical gap in data on stress biology among sexual minorities,
particularly those with intersecting identities, we added a pilot biological data collection (dried blood spots;
DBS) to NCHAT to create the NCHAT Stress Biology Study (NCHAT-BIO). Biological data collection is
complete, but samples are yet to be assayed. In this R21, we will assay these samples to measure
inflammation (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein) and cellular immune function (Epstein-Barr virus reactivation).
In a diverse cohort of 763 NCHAT participants, we will address these empirical aims:
 Aim 1: Delineate differences in immune regulation among sexual minorities versus
heterosexuals. Hypothesis: Sexual minorities will exhibit greater inflammation and poorer cellular immune
function with differential effects among lesbian, gay, and bisexual women and men. Aim 2: Examine effects
of stigma, discrimination, and intersectionality on biomarkers of immune dysregulation within a
minority stress framework. Hypotheses: Experiences of stigma and discrimination will predict greater
inflammation and poorer cellular immune function with stronger effects among sexual minorities and, in
particular, sexual minority participants of color. Aim 3: Identify modifiable behaviors and treatable
psychological factors linking stress with immune dysregulation. Hypotheses: Modifiable health behaviors
(substance use, exercise, diet) and treatable psychological factors (depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance) will
mediate the link between sexual minority stress with immune dysregulation, presenting targets for intervention.
 NCHAT-BIO offers a uniquely comprehensive and methodologically rigorous investigation of stress
biology among sexual minorities in the US, permitting novel tests of mechanisms linking stress and health
within a minority stress framework. This R21 will support a future R01 addressing longitudinal changes in
stress biology in the NCHAT cohort."
10744239,"REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION
 PROJECT SUMMARY
 DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin.
AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during
epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA
motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding
TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early
and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently
altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation,
including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif
grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.
 Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of
differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of
hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second,
it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal
tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to
characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.
 Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif
grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC
eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target
genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the
impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal
neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene
expression and disease progression.
 This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA
grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression.
RELEVANCE
 Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers,
psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in
enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the
patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation
may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders."
10758562,"ABSTRACT Epidemiological evidence suggests that environmental exposures during development may play a
role in disease susceptibility later in life, and researchers have hypothesized that epigenetic changes induced
by common toxicants such as pesticides, herbicides, endocrine disruptors, and heavy metals may be
facilitating this link 1,2. The mechanisms by which these changes are induced and propagated remain
challenging to dissect, largely because environmental toxicant induced changes are often 1) subtle when
assayed across the bulk cell population, 2) transient in nature and therefore difficult to reproducibly detect,
and/or 3) randomly distributed throughout the genome, making reproducibility and measurement of statistical
significance challenging. In fact, most studies trying to link toxicant exposures directly to frank cellular
transformation, including our own, have been relative failures. In virtually all cases, in order to see overt
transformation, exposure studies need to be conducted in cell or animal models that already have baseline
genetic or epigenetic changes that facilitate the progression to malignancy.
 We have exciting preliminary data that demonstrates that Ewing sarcoma cells demonstrate a
significantly elevated level of transcriptional and replication stress (RS), and we propose that environmental
exposures may not only induce RS and activate the RSR, but also cause epigenetic changes that precondition
cells to allow for survival following expression of driver fusion proteins despite elevated levels of RS. This
proposal will focus our efforts on understanding the downstream effects of TCDD exposures in mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) when paired with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and investigate the role of STAG2 in modulating
downstream molecular events associated with environmental toxicant exposures. Our overall hypothesis is
that environmental toxicant exposures cooperate with STAG2 loss to increase replication stress, ultimately
leading to genomic and epigenomic instability, and creating a permissive epigenome for fusion gene
expression. Three Specific Aims are proposed:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposures increase baseline levels of
replication stress in iMSC and cooperate with STAG2 loss to lead to epigenomic remodeling.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposures cooperate with STAG2 loss to lead
increased clonal genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To determine whether environmental toxicant exposure leads to a permissive epigenome for
survival of pre-malignant cells following fusion protein expression."

Evidence indicates that racial and ethnic minority patients undergoing surgery receive worse quality care and
experience worse outcomes than White patients do in the U.S. “Clinician factors” are one of five key
determinants of surgical disparities identified at the National Institutes of Health and American College of
Surgeons Summit in 2015. However, little is known about the characteristics of surgeons who deliver high-
quality care to racial and ethnic minority patients, and whether education and training surgeons received affect
surgical disparities. These knowledge gaps have hindered efforts to develop interventions that can effectively
close the disparity gap in surgical care. The proposed R01 project will create a comprehensive, multi-level
database that includes detailed information about patients, surgeons, medical schools surgeons attended, and
residency programs surgeons completed, by linking four large, nationally-representative datasets: (1) Medicare
data, (2) comprehensive physician database assembled by Doximity, (3) the AAMC Medical School database,
and (4) the AMA Residency database. In Aim 1, using this innovative dataset, we will examine whether
surgical care (i.e., processes of care, patient outcomes, and utilizations) differ between Black or Hispanic
patients versus White patients when they are treated by the same surgeons using multi-level regression
models. In Aim 2, we will identify individual characteristics of surgeons (e.g., age, gender, whether surgeons
speak languages other than English, and the proportion of patients treating who are racial/ethnic minorities
[“minority-serving surgeons”]) that are associated with racial/ethnic disparities in surgical care. Finally, using
the information on the characteristics of medical schools and residency programs collected by AAMC and
AMA, Aim 3 will determine whether the characteristics of medical schools (e.g., the proportion of racial/ethnic
minority faculty/students, the percentage of international students, location in rural vs. urban areas) and
residency programs (e.g., the proportion of racial and ethnic minority faculty/students/patients, the presence of
cultural competence awareness program, instruction in non-English languages) related to cultural competency
lead to improved surgical care received by racial and ethnic minority patients. The proposed R01 project will
provide a unique opportunity to advance the field by better understanding the mechanisms of disparities
related to surgeon factors, and will identify potentially modifiable attributes of surgeons, medical schools, and
residency programs that contribute to disparities in surgical care. This project will provide a strong evidence
base for developing interventions, such as evidence-based cultural competency programs and Continuing
Medical Education, which can effectively reduce racial and ethnic disparities in surgical care. The research
team consists of multiple NIH-funded researchers with expertise in all relevant fields (health services research,
disparity research, surgical education, and statistics) to conduct this innovative research. The proposed study
aligns well with the NIH strategic plan for research in minority health and health disparities."
10758579,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Groundbreaking discoveries resulting in the “immuno-revolution” have established the importance of
immunology across medical disciplines. Inflammation has long been considered as an important mechanism
contributing to the progression of ischemic and nonischemic forms of heart failure. Countless studies have
reported associations between numerous serum cytokines, adverse left ventricular remodeling, and patient
outcomes in the settings of chronic heart failure and myocardial infarction. While these observations highlight
the potential utility of suppressing inflammation in the heart, early clinical studies investigating anti-
inflammatory therapies in patients who experienced a myocardial infarction (corticosteroids) or those with
chronic heart failure (corticosteroids, TNF blockade) revealed disappointing results and dampened enthusiasm
around further drug development. At that time, limited information existed regarding the precise immune cell
types that promote disease and the signaling mechanisms that exert their effects.
In recent years, a renewed interest in targeting the immune system in cardiovascular disease has emerged.
This resurgence is powered by the discovery of the cellular mediators of inflammation in the heart and the
identification of the mechanisms that orchestrate their activation and damaging effector functions. These
findings exemplify the exciting, but unmet, opportunity to effectively target the immune system and improve
outcomes for individuals with cardiac diseases.
The proposed research program will built upon our laboratory’s prior accomplishments that have uncovered
remarkable diversity amongst the composition and function of macrophages in the healthy, failing, and
transplanted heart. We will integrate 3 active projects into a unified research program that aims to 1) dissect
new biological mechanisms governing cardiac macrophage diversity and function, and 2) translate our findings
into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to abrogate heart failure pathogenesis, potentiate functional
recovery of the failing heart, and prevent heart transplant rejection. Key themes will include the roles of
mechanosensing, inflammatory signaling, and monocyte fate specification in the pathogenesis of heart failure
across disease etiologies, cardiac tissue repair and recovery, and heart transplant rejection."
10928806,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic pain is a major health condition in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (PLWH) despite
the use of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART). Unlike other human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) areas of
research (e.g., HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, vaccine), chronic pain is an understudied area of
research despite the prevalence of pain in PLWH, lack of effective analgesic therapy, and incomplete
understanding of mechanisms. The development of therapeutic strategies and a better understanding of HIV-
related neuropathic pain mechanisms have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that mimics
chronic neuropathic pain in PLWH. The current small animal model for HIV-related neuropathic pain consists of
the acute administration of a single HIV viral protein, such as glycoprotein 120 (gp120). This model has served
to determine the pain response to this viral protein and its mechanism of action. However, in addition to gp120,
other HIV viral proteins, HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat), and Viral protein R (Vpr) can produce pain.
Therefore, a single HIV protein is unlikely to be the only contributor to HIV-neuropathic pain and mimics the HIV
chronic condition where there is a continuous presence of HIV and a simultaneous presence of viral proteins.
The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that EcoHIV-infected mice develop a neuropathic pain-like
condition with behavioral and pathological changes that mimic PLWH with chronic neuropathic pain. A
multidisciplinary approach of behavior, pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and histopathology will
test this hypothesis. Aim 1. We will perform comprehensive studies to characterize neuropathic pain in EcoHIV-
infected mice. We will use a battery of behavioral assessments of sensory and spontaneous/ongoing pain.
Analyzing markers clinically used for the diagnosis of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy (e.g., decrease in
intraepidermal nerve fiber density) will serve to validate the EcoHIV-associated neuropathic pain model. We will
also analyze neuroinflammation, a key player in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain.
The proposed studies will have a significant impact on the fields of HIV and pain by providing a small animal
model to study HIV-related neuropathic pain, which has been lacking. Characterization of the EcoHIV-related
neuropathic pain model will advance current research on pain in the context of HIV by laying the groundwork for
urgently and critically needed studies."
10931506,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: The goal of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to further validate the genetically defined
Oncopig hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model—capable of modeling diverse HCC driver mutational profiles
through induced KRASG12D and TP53R167H expression and subsequent CRISPR editing—for preclinical
evaluation of locally delivered, personalized HCC therapies. HCC is an aggressive liver malignancy representing
the 7th most common cancer and the 4th most common cause of cancer death worldwide, illustrating the critical
need for improved HCC treatment options. Since HCC and other cancers are driven by the accumulation of
genetic driver mutations conferring selective growth advantages, personalized cancer models are required to
evaluate targeted therapeutics for this deadly disease. Furthermore, the use of transarterial delivery-based
approaches for HCC treatment combined with similarities in size and drug metabolism between pigs and humans
highlights the critical need and translational value of the genetically defined Oncopig HCC model for investigating
novel and re-purposed therapeutics targeting specific driver mutations. Importantly, there is broad interest in the
use of Oncopigs in preclinical trials (see Support Letters). This proposal will demonstrate differential efficacy of
transarterial targeted PI3K inhibitor delivery to Oncopig PTENKO (PI3K inhibitor responsive) and KEAP1KO (PI3K
inhibitor non-responsive) HCC tumors using a clinically relevant trial design. Use of liquid biopsies for minimally
invasive HCC driver mutation quantification (see Volition Support Letter) will facilitate translation of HCC
precision medicine approaches into clinical practice, currently lacking due to infrequency of routine HCC biopsy
collection for biological profiling. The genetically defined Oncopig HCC model will be validated for targeted
therapeutic testing by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) Characterize genetically defined Oncopig HCC
tumors over a clinically relevant 3-month diagnostic monitoring period. (2) Demonstrate delivery of targeted PI3K
inhibitor therapeutic doses to Oncopig HCC tumors via transarterial embolization. (3) Demonstrate efficacy of
transarterial targeted PI3K inhibitor delivery for Oncopig PTENKO HCC in a clinically relevant 3-month follow-up
timeframe. The ability to achieve quantifiable therapeutic PI3K inhibitor concentrations following transarterial
delivery in the genetically defined Oncopig HCC model will be demonstrated, in addition to a clinically relevant
difference in response (40% increase in complete response rate in PTENKO compared to KEAP1KO HCC) based
on clinically employed mRECIST guidelines. This work will validate the genetically defined Oncopig HCC
model for targeted therapeutic evaluation, enabling Sus Clinicals to provide personalized tumor
development and targeted therapeutic testing services using the Oncopig platform. Future work focused
on expanding Sus Clinicals commercialization of this technology will include expansion of personalized modeling
approaches for other cancers, demonstration of use for precision diagnostic evaluation, personalized comorbidity
modeling, and expanding marketing efforts to include the pharmaceutical sector."
11012264,"Abstract
Shasqi is developing a platform to activate drugs at a specific site in the body, thus enhancing their efficacy while
minimizing systemic toxicity and adverse drug events (ADEs). Most drugs are administered systemically and
spread throughout the body. Due to lack of specificity for the pathological site, high doses are required to achieve
effective therapeutic concentrations, causing toxicity and ADEs at sites of the body where they are not needed.
Each year, there are approximately 1.2 million reports of ADEs in the U.S. alone, representing over 5% of all
hospitalized patients. The overall costs of ADE-related morbidity and mortality are thought to exceed $177 billion.
ADEs also contribute to the 90% failure rate of drug candidates due to the inability to achieve therapeutic
concentrations at the target site or intolerable side effects. To overcome these critical limitations, Shasqi
designed the Click Activated Protodrugs (CAP) platform to achieve higher concentrations of active drugs at
specific pathological sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. CAP consists of an activating agent that is targeted
to a disease site and a protodrug that is administered systematically. At the target site, the activating agent
selectively and rapidly captures the protodrug via a bioorthogonal click chemistry reaction, followed by local
release of active drug. The first-generation CAP system used an injectable sodium hyaluronate (NaHA)
biopolymer as the activating agent and doxorubicin (Dox) for the protodrug. This system is now being tested in
a Phase 2a trial in patients with injectable solid tumors. Over 8 dose escalation cohorts, a dose-limiting toxicity
has not been observed, even at doses up to 12-times the molar equivalent of conventional Dox per cycle. This
demonstrates the striking effectiveness of the CAP platform at limiting drug-related toxicities. Shasqi now seeks
to develop a second-generation (Gen2) platform with an antigen-targeted version of the activating agent to
enable local activation of the protodrug at multiple sites, including locations not reachable by injection. As a proof
of concept of this technology, Shasqi has demonstrated through conducting Phase I-equivalent studies the dose-
dependent tumor regression in a HER+ gastric cancer model through HER2-targeting of a protodrug of the
chemotherapeutic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). For this Direct to Phase II project Shasqi will further
advance this system by undertaking four specific aims: 1) developing and testing novel HER2-targeted activating
agent conjugates in vivo, 2) confirming efficacy of selected conjugate with TCO-MMAE in a syngeneic HER2+
breast cancer model, 3) performing pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and dosing optimization, and 4) GLP
manufacturing of protodrug and cell line development for HER2 Fab-Tz to enable toxicology studies. These aims
will identify novel antigen-targeted structures for use in Shasqi’s Gen2 CAP and will advance an initial product
toward the clinic. This will provide a better understanding of the antigen-targeted activating agents in the platform,
which could be used in the future to develop site-directed treatments for other indications, including antibiotics
for site-specific infections, autoimmunity, and localized anti-inflammatory and pain management."
11160272,"Abstract:
Older adults with cognitive impairment experience an increased risk of falling than those without cognitive
impairment. Unfortunately detecting falls or assessing fall risk among persons living with dementia (PLWD) can
be challenging due to difficulties in collecting self-reported information or communicating functional test
instructions. The proposed project will develop and test an automated fall detection system using Ultra
Wideband (UWB) band technology. The advantage of UWB, along with well-established accelerometer and
gyroscope technology, is that it produces a more precise resolution (5-10cm) than Bluetooth (1-5m) or Wi-Fi
(5-10m). UWB’s real-time location tracking capacity can enhance fall detection accuracy and context, and with
a call alert system reduce response time. In addition, the proposed system will collect rich mobility data to
enable the detection of mobility-related fall risk (e.g., changes in gait and balance). Thus, if successful, the
proposed system is expected to simplify and enhance mobility-based fall risk, fall detection, and quickly send
alerts for PLWD. Building on prior work to develop a fall detection system prototype, this fast-track application
proposes two phases moving from lab studies to real-world applications. Phase 1 will test the ability of
Theora® 360, a novel fall detection system, to detect simulated falls in a laboratory setting, whether sensor
location makes a difference in fall detection accuracy and initial user feedback. Milestones to proceed to the
next phase are 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity in fall detection in a laboratory setting and codification of
protocols, preliminary algorithms, and data platforms for 3D location processing, motion sensing/
categorization, and fall detection. Phase 2 will assess Theora® 360’s ability to detect mobility-based falls
among PLWD and to predict changes in fall risk over time in 60 care-recipient-caregiver dyads living at home.
Using a previously established neural network, changes in overall mobility, gait characteristics, and daily
routines will be observed to develop algorithms for activity modeling and risk profiling. Feedback on technology
use and user satisfaction including recommendations for solution improvement will be obtained through
technology records, usability surveys, and interviews at the end of the study. Thus, the study represents a
mixed model approach with objective sensor data on a 24/7 basis; functional assessments, survey data
assessing sociodemographic, care, and psychosocial factors collected five times throughout the study, and
qualitative usability data collected toward the end of the study to better understand the complexity of assessing
fall risks and commercialization potential of this new technology among PLWD and their caregivers. Envisioned
as a corporate-academic partnership between Clairvoyant Networks and Texas A&M University Center for
Community Health and Aging, this proposal draws upon expertise in business, aging, dementia, public health,
clinical sciences, computer sciences, and engineering, and will benefit from the input of a distinguished
advisory group."

with RSV in the U.S. every year, there is no treatment option available aside from symptom-management.
 Like many respiratory pathogens, RSV spreads in the lungs by shedding daughter virions from infected
cells exclusively back into the airways. From there, RSV must traverse the airway mucus (AM) before
infecting other neighboring cells, remaining restricted to the airways with little-to-no systemic viremia. This
important mechanism of spread makes RSV difficult to target by systemically dosed therapies; the antiviral
drugs need to make their way to the airway mucus in order to inactivate virions and halt infection. We believe
an RSV-specific, safe, and effective antiviral therapy that can be inhaled directly into the respiratory tract using
a hand-held device at home would provide a powerful treatment option.
 To meet this goal, Inhalon is advancing IN-002, a mAb that binds and neutralizes RSV F protein with
picomolar binding affinity and neutralization potency, and has minimal risks of viral escape. Importantly, in
addition to the well-established IgG Fc effector functions, IN-002 is also engineered to possess Fc N-glycans
optimized to trap RSV in AM. Once trapped, RSV virions are quickly purged from the airways via natural
mucociliary clearance mechanisms. We have further formulated IN-002 to be stably nebulized using a portable
vibrating mesh nebulizer. By delivering IN-002 directly to the site of infection (the airways), we expect to
achieve high drug concentrations with a lower dose of mAb, saving costs and potentially improving efficacy. In
a neonatal lamb model of RSV infection, nebulized therapy with IN-002 reduced RSV viral load in the lungs
and BALF to almost non-detectible levels, unlike placebo-treated animals. Inhalon is the first company to
successfully complete a Phase 1 study for an inhaled mAb therapy (IN-006) for COVID, achieving very high
levels of drug in the airways with an excellent safety profile. Inhalon has received FDA feedback on its pre-IND
submission for IN-002, and is currently completing IND-enabling preclinical activities for IN-002, including GLP
inhalation tox, GLP tissue cross reactivity, and GLP nebulization characterization. Further, Inhalon has already
established a GMP-compliant master cell bank for production of IN-002, from which scaled up production of tox
materials have already been generated. Here, we are seeking support to complete: (i) the production, vialing
and characterization of IN-002 clinical trial materials produced under GMP (Aim 1), and (ii) IND submission to
receive approval to initiate Phase 1 clinical studies (Aim 2). Successful completion of the proposed activities
would allow us to advance IN-002 into first-in-human studies."
10897262,"Project Summary/Abstract
We have recently discovered dehydroamino acids (DHAAs) in the capsid and matrix proteins that make up
HIV-1 virions. These dehydroalanine (DHA) and dehydrobutyrine (DHB) residues result from posttranslational
modification of serine, threonine, or cysteine residues. We propose here to investigate the importance and
origin of these fascinating protein modifications. Their high prevalence in these viral proteins, in marked
contrast to their low levels in the human proteome generally, raises two key questions: a) why are they there?
and b) how did they get there? We hypothesize that DHAAs are present in virions because they play important
roles in the HIV virion assembly or capsid maturation. We hypothesize further that DHAAs are formed by a
presently unknown enzymatic activity in viral or host proteins.
To test these hypotheses, we will conduct mutation and inactivation studies of the amino acids that convert to
dehydroamino acids and study the effects on the viral replication cycle and infectivity. We will use quantitative
proteomics to determine how much of this modification is generated and whether it is before or after viral
maturation. We will seek to discover intra- or intermolecular protein crosslinks, which dehydroamino acids are
known to be able to form, using innovative proteomics approaches. Further, we will seek to discover the
enzyme responsible for the formation of these modifications. The discovery of the enzyme responsible for
DHAA formation would be interesting as fundamental biology, offer new insights into HIV replication, and
potentially reveal a new therapeutic pathway for the treatment of HIV infection."

This is a resubmission application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to support the
career development of Dr. Stephanie Matt to facilitate her transition to an independent academic investigator in
the HIV and neuroimmunology research fields. An intense and comprehensive mentoring and research plan has
been developed to use high-throughput techniques to assess antidepressant-mediated HIV viral dynamics and
inflammatory signaling in human myeloid and co-culture models. Dr. Matt’s training will be supported by a firm
institutional commitment to her career development and a strong mentoring team of leaders in the HIV and
psychoneuroimmunology research fields, each providing strategic guidance in both the development of this
proposal and mentoring as her career progresses. The proposed research plan is a natural extension of the
recent studies Dr. Matt has been conducting in her mentor Dr. Peter Gaskill’s laboratory but is distinguished by
examination of HIV infection and inflammation in clinical cohorts, biostatistical analyses, as well as neuronal
profiling. Neurological complications of HIV infection (neuroHIV) remain prevalent even with antiretroviral therapy
(ART). Depression is one of these increasingly common complications that can substantively worsen HIV
disease progression. Myeloid cells such as macrophages and microglia are primary HIV targets that can serve
as viral reservoirs and drive HIV neuropathogenesis, but their activation also mediates depression-associated
inflammation. Inflammatory links between HIV, depression, and the drugs used to treat them are not well
understood. However, HIV, depression, and antidepressants act on receptors and transporters that alter
neurotransmission, and neurotransmitter receptor activity on immune cells can influence inflammatory signaling
and HIV infection. This suggests that changes in neurotransmitter levels by antidepressants could affect the size
of myeloid HIV reservoirs, exacerbating neuroHIV and influencing the progression of depression and treatment
resistance. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that specific antidepressants can
activate both CNS and peripheral myeloid cells that critically contribute to inflammation and HIV
persistence. This proposal will test this hypothesis using a multifaceted approach to evaluate the effects of in
vivo antidepressants and ART on viral dynamics and inflammation in myeloid cells in association with cognitive
function in depressed people living with HIV (Aim 1), effects of antidepressants regulating discrete viral dynamics
in HIV-infected, ART-treated iPSC CNS and peripheral myeloid populations (Aim 2), and how antidepressants
influence viral dynamics and neuronal function in co-cultures of HIV-infected, ART-treated microglia and distinct
neuronal subtypes (Aim 3). These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the cellular
mechanisms underlying the role of antidepressants in HIV neuropathogenesis. This opportunity will provide
comprehensive training and a solid foundation on which to build a successful and independent research program
to investigate mechanisms by which neuropsychiatric drugs could drive inflammation in the context of HIV."
10763896,"As people age, they experience declining physical performance, which is associated with diminished
quality of life, augmented health care costs, and is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality. Thus,
uncovering mechanisms that underlie age-associated mobility decline and identifying reliable biomarkers
to predict this decline is imperative for the development of interventions to maintain physical ability with
age. Mitochondria generate chemical energy to support homeostatic function of most cells in the body,
and mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to age-associated decline in physical performance. This has been
studied predominantly in skeletal muscle mitochondria since muscle function is central to physical ability.
However, it is recognized that muscle function is not the sole determinant of mobility, and that input from
other organ systems (cardiovascular and central nervous system) is also required. While age associated
mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed across all organ systems, the contribution of this systemic
bioenergetic dysfunction to age-associated mobility decline has not been assessed. The current study
brings together two PIs with expertise in mitochondrial biology who have independently optimized and
validated complementary assays (high resolution respirometery and Seahorse extracellular flux analysis)
for the measurement of systemic bioenergetic function utilizing blood cells (platelets and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells). Preliminary data using these assays show that blood cell mitochondrial function
reflects bioenergetics of solid tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle, heart, lung, brain) and correlates with multiple
measures of physical ability. However, it is unknown whether blood cell bioenergetics reflect skeletal
muscle function or are predictive of mobility decline in older adults. The Study of Muscle, Mobility and
Aging (SOMMA) is a multi-site longitudinal study of older adults (≥70 years; n=875). SOMMA focuses on
the relationship between skeletal muscle mitochondria and mobility decline and will obtain skeletal
muscle biopsies to measure mitochondrial function in all participants. Physical performance measures
will at baseline and three years follow-up. The current proposal is an ancillary study that synergizes with
SOMMA to add blood cell bioenergetic measurements in all SOMMA participants at baseline as well as
at the three year follow up visit. Using these data, we will test whether blood cell bioenergetics are 1)
reflective of skeletal muscle mass and function, 2) are associated with physical performance measures
(400 m walk), and 3) are predictive of physical performance decline in older adults. Completion of this
study will elucidate systemic mitochondrial changes that are associated with age-related physical decline,
and potentially establish blood cell bioenergetics as a biomarker of systemic mitochondrial function that
can be utilized as a surrogate for muscle biopsies, and as a predictor of mobility decline in the aging
population."
10779863,"Astrocytes, the most populous glial cell in the central nervous system (CNS), play essential role in brain
development and function including ion/neurotransmitter homeostasis, synapse formation/removal and
synaptic transmission modulation. These crucial functions are molecularly determined by their gene signatures
which are controlled by nuclear transcription factors. In response to neurological diseases and injuries,
astrocytes become reactive astrocytes and adopt neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective functions which modulate
CNS pathophysiology. The ultimately functional output of reactive astrocytes is determined by their differential
gene expression signature which is controlled transcriptional factors. Our long-term goal has been centered on
unveiling mechanisms underlying CNS glial cell homeostasis and pathophysiology with a focus on the
transcription factor SOX2. We found that SOX2 is highly enriched in adult quiescent astrocytes and retained in
reactive astrocytes in response to inflammatory demyelinating injury. However, little is known about the
functional significance of SOX2 in regulating astrocyte biology and pathology. Recently, we reported a crucial
role of SOX2 in astrocyte maturation and animal behavior. As a transcription factor, SOX2 binds to the
regulatory elements of a cohort of astrocytic signature and functional genes and modulates their expression.
These data highlight the importance of SOX2 in astrocyte development and function. We employed a “top-
down” approach to investigate functional significance of SOX2 in adult astrocytes. Astrocyte-specific SOX2
conditional knockout (cKO) results in hyperactive locomotor yet normal motor coordination and cognition
functions. Furthermore, astrocyte SOX2 cKO mice develop worse clinical symptoms in response to EAE injury.
In this project, we will test the hypothesis that SOX2 is essential for adult astrocyte homeostasis and function
and its deficiency in reactive astrocytes exacerbates inflammatory demyelinating injury. This project, upon
completion, will provide the first conceptual landscape of the functional significance of SOX2 in quiescent
astrocytes and reactive astrocytes."
10765718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The disproportionate impact of covid-19 in U.S. jails and prisons offers stark evidence of a reality
rooted in history: the incarceration of more than two million people constitutes a public health catastrophe.
Mass incarceration threatens the well-being of communities and exacerbates health disparities. Inside of
prisons, incarcerated people face a variety of health challenges. They are more likely to have HIV/AIDS,
Hepatitis C, tuberculosis, and an array of common sexually transmitted diseases than their non-
incarcerated counterparts; over 40 percent of people in prisons have a chronic condition. Peer-reviewed
literature, news reports, and legal claims provide evidence of egregious shortfalls in prison medical
services. As increasing evidence emerges demonstrating that prison health care is inadequate, there
remains no comprehensive study of how this overwhelming contemporary health policy and humanitarian
crisis arose. Minimal Standards of Adequacy: A History of Health Care in U.S. Prisons explores how
incarcerated people, medical and corrections professionals, reformers, policy makers, and the courts
defined and perceived prison medical services during the past century. Building upon path-breaking work
about the health consequences of incarceration, about the history of prisons, and about how incarcerated
people endured and resisted being abused and exploited as medical research subjects, the book explores
questions related to so-called routine medical care. It begins in the 1920s and 1930s, when state-level
court cases and federal legislation related to prison hospitals highlighted confounding questions about
health-related rights and governmental obligations in carceral institutions. It explores the amorphous
standards that influenced prison-based care in the post-World War II years, and how incarcerated men
and women experienced medical services. Minimal Standards also assesses prison health activism,
paying special attention to its connection with the civil rights movement, and the 1976 Supreme Court
case, Estelle v. Gamble, which, building on state-level lawsuits, helped establish that people in prisons
have a constitutional right to health care. It shows that, in the wake of Estelle, professional organizations
like the American Medical Association and American Public Health Association articulated standards for
service provision even as prisons became more prevalent, more bureaucratized, more privatized, and
more openly punitive. The book ends with the recognition that more than forty years after Supreme Court
Justice John Paul Stevens maintained that the government must “provide the persons in its custody with a
health care system which meets minimal standards of adequacy,” major legal and ethical questions
regarding the medical rights of incarcerated people – and reports of abuses of those rights – abound.
Based on rigorous research in national, state, and local archives, Minimal Standards offers insights about
legal, medical, policy, and prison history, and perspective on the roots of a modern public health calamity."
10766225,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals who experience traumatic physical injury are at a heightened risk for a range of negative outcomes
such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance misuse. The early post-trauma period (i.e., the
days, weeks, and months following exposure) represents a critical period of recovery and may be especially
important for understanding symptom development among emerging adults (aged 18-25), who are
characterized by a developmental peak in substance use behaviors and an increased risk for trauma exposure
and injury. As regional laws, cultures, and beliefs about cannabis use (CU) continue to shift, there is concern
that traumatic injury may result in escalations in cannabis use, as many individuals report using cannabis to
relieve distress, hyperarousal, and other post-trauma symptoms. Furthermore, while the majority of US states
that have legalized cannabis for medical use include outcomes of stress and trauma (such as PTSD) as
qualifying conditions for a state-issued medical marijuana license, little is known about how CU may impact the
early post-trauma course, including development of PTSD and other stress-related outcomes such as
depression, anxiety, and substance misuse. Despite the known role of the endocannabinoid system in
regulating the stress response, limited (and contradicting) evidence exists regarding safety and efficacy of
cannabis precludes strong conclusions about its role during acute post-trauma recovery, with some
prospective studies demonstrating detrimental or no long-term effects of CU on PTSD symptoms. The
overarching goals of the proposed study are to characterize CU as related to post-trauma symptoms and
cannabis misuse during the period immediately following trauma exposure among a sample of injured
emerging adults. We will recruit N=100 trauma-exposed cannabis users (aged 18-25) presenting to the
Emergency Department for evaluation after acute injury (e.g., physical assault, serious vehicular crashes).
Upon discharge, participants will complete 4-weeks of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to record CU
behavior and PTSD symptom development, paired with passive collection of physiological output (heart rate)
via wearable biosensors (smartwatch) to monitor physiology. Participants will return for completion of clinical
interview and self-report of symptoms at 4-weeks and 6-months post-discharge. The main objectives of this
research are to: (a) characterize the course of PTSD symptom development, physiology, and cannabis use
during the acute post-trauma period and (b) evaluate effects of the acute post-trauma response on long term
development of PTSD and other stress sensitive outcomes (depression, anxiety, cannabis misuse) at 6-month
follow-up."
10766229,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Child abuse and neglect represent one of the most serious pediatric public health crises, affecting nearly
1 in 7 children. Fractures are the 2nd most common abusive injury after skin and soft tissue injuries and there is
much overlap between the types of fractures caused by abuse and unintentional mechanisms. The diagnosis of
child abuse is complex and necessitates an accurate understanding of typical pediatric injury patterns within the
context of history, mechanism, socio-demographics, and developmental capabilities. Many studies evaluating
the relationship between fractures and abuse focused on specific fracture types, were restricted to children with
a pre-defined abusive injury or included only admitted patients, and/or relatively small cohorts, thus limiting
conclusions and raising concerns of spectrum bias. Additionally, prior literature has shown implicit and explicit
biases related to socio-demographic factors in the identification and evaluation of abuse, likely resulting in over-
and underdiagnosis of abuse in some populations. Furthermore, over 75% of children seeking ED care are seen
in general ED’s by providers without specialized training in child development and abuse, and up to 1 in 5 children
with abusive fractures may be missed in a general ED setting. Despite the frequency of abusive fractures and
the potential limitations and biases in making the diagnosis, there are no validated clinical decision rules (CDRs)
to assist clinicians in the real-time identification of children with fracture presentations associated with abuse.
Our long-term goal is to develop a validated CDR that can be used by clinicians evaluating injured children to
assist in the identification of abusive fracture presentations. Our primary objective is to utilize gradient boosted
decision tree ensembles to develop a CDR that will identify fracture presentations highly concerning for abuse
among patients ≤5 years presenting for emergency department (ED) care. An institutional child protection
database that includes outcomes of thorough expert child abuse investigations will be used as a reference
standard. The study objectives will be accomplished by 1) analyzing structured variables in the electronic health
record (EHR) of patients with fractures evaluated in the Hasbro Children’s Hospital (HCH) ED and HCH Child
Protection Program (CPP) using descriptive statistics, 2) applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques
to extract data from clinical narratives and radiology reports to generate text-derived variables, 3) employing
machine learning (ML) techniques to identify predictor variables to derive and iteratively refine a CDR, and 4)
validating this CDR with a different HCH cohort of patients. The expected immediate outcome of this project is
the development of a refined CDR to identify fracture presentations that are highly concerning for abuse among
children ≤5 years old. This will inform the design of a prospective multi-center follow-up study for broad validation
of CDR’s ability to identify high risk patient presentations, improve real-time clinical detection of potentially
abusive injuries, and decrease disparities in clinical decision making."
10766263,"ABSTRACT: Resource Section
This proposal seeks renewal of 5 year support for the infrastructure, personnel, and resources of the Mutant
Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) at the University of California (UC) Davis (MMRRC-UCD).
Since its inception 20 years ago, the MMRRC-UCD has been one of the primary mutant mouse archive and
distribution repositories in the world. As the largest of the 4 Centers in the MMRRC Consortium, the MMRRC-
UCD has assumed a position of leadership in innovation and resource development. The MMRRC-UCD has
introduced new products (e.g., KOMP knockout first alleles in ES cells, CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited alleles in
zygotes) and initiated new services (e.g., blastocyst injection, ICSI, speed congenics, genetic variant modeling,
microbiome analysis) that have added scientific value to mouse models submitted to the MMRRC, which in
turn has enhanced utilization of the MMRRC by the scientific research community. As a result, to date the
MMRRC-UCD leads the Consortium in the number of alleles archived (50,040 out of 59,847), orders (6,293 out
of 13,165), and investigators served (4,372 out of 6477) at 2,445 institutions in 23 countries. The MMRRC-
UCD has leveraged its infrastructure and expertise to extend its service role by contracting with categorical
NIH institutes (e.g., NHLBI BayGenomics project), biotechnology companies (Genentech), and several
organizations (e.g., the BaSH Consortium) to archive, distribute, custom breed, genotype, and phenotype
1000’s of transgenic and knockout, gene-targeted ES cell lines, BAC-transgenic, CRE, ENU-induced, and
other mutant mouse collections. In addition, the MMRRC-UCD has worked with its MMRRC Consortium
partners and NIH program staff to develop and implement advertising and marketing strategies, database
management and informatics applications, website and online resources, customer and user services,
operating procedures and protocols, and policies and practicies for shared governance. Further, over the last
several years, the MMRRC-UCD completed several research projects in multiple areas that have enhanced
operations of the resource, including in cryopreservation, gut microbiome analysis, mouse analgesics
administration, genetic variant modeling using CRISPR/Cas9, and more. Over the next 5 years, the MMRRC-
UCD looks forward to the assignment of another ~250 mouse lines (Type 1), providing users access to several
new services including Fast-Track Genome Editing and Genomic Integration Analysis, and conducting 3 new
research projects in the areas of microbiome transplantation, quantitative embryo evaluation, and multi-omic
molecular analyses. By archiving and delivering research mouse products and services effectively and
efficiently, and by conducting applied research activities to improve operations of the resource, the MMRRC-
UCD aims to continue as a scientifically valuable biorepository for the biomedical research community. Over
the next 5 years, we shall focus our efforts on optimizing the quality of our resource, ensuring its relevance to
individual users, and seeking maximum performance for the benefit of all whom we serve."
10766266,"ABSTRACT: Project 1, Quantitative analytical assessment of mouse embryo quality
Embryo manipulation (e.g., cryopreservation and recovery, rederivation, genetic manipulation, etc) is central to
the MMRRC mission. Today’s gold-standard evaluation of embryo quality relies on trained technicians visually
evaluating morphology and overall appearance under light microscopy. Another mission of the MMRRC is to
conduct research that increases the value of the repository to the scientific community. Genetic engineering
technology offers the potential to modify existing lines or even generated specific new lines. The Ravata
individual zygote electroporator (RIZE) is capable of sensing the electrical properties of the embryo and
quantitatively evaluating embryo stage and health. The ability to quantitatively evaluate embryo health would
establish a standardize protocol across all centers with minimized variability between technicians and centers.
Further, the limitations in the ability to cryopreserve embryos post genetic manipulation prevent the ability of
MMRRC centers to engineer lines and cryopreserve them for rederivation at a future date. These hurdles and
roadblocks could all be overcome by using IVF-generated and frozen zygotes that are cryorecovered on the
day of electroporation and then cryopreserved again after electroporation to await cryorecovery for embryo
transfer at a later time. We have assembled a unique team of experts to advance the mission of the MMRRC
and take these novel technologies and apply them to standardizing quantitative evaluation of cryopreserved
embryos and genetically engineered embryos in the following aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop, establish, and
validate a protocol for reliable and reproducible quantitative evaluation of cryorecovered IVF-derived embryos.
The combination of our expertise in embryo manipulation in combination with the RIZE sensor enables us to
investigate this novel quantitative method for assessing embryo health pre and post -cryopreservation prior to
embryo transfer. Specific Aim 2: Apply quantitative evaluation to select IVF-derived embryos for CRISPR
genome editing for embryo transfer. We will use the RIZE sensor to quantitatively assess the viability of
embryos after CRISPR-EZ. Our expectation is that a quantitative method of evaluating embryo health will help
to provide a means to standardize embryo quality assessment across centers, increase post thaw viability, and
decrease variation between groups. Additionally, the MMRRC will be able to improve liveborn rates after
embryo cryopreservation, CRISPR electroporation, and transfer.
ABSTRACT: Project 2, Optimizing the rederivation of gut microbiota from MMRRC mice
The MMRRC plays a pivotal role in archiving mouse models in publicly accessible repositories, provides
numerous services to investigators and conducts novel research to enhance MMRRC services and improve
the quality, reproducibility and robustness of mouse models. The MMRRC recognizes the importance of the
microbiota associated with the archived mouse lines and has recently began fecal banking at the time of
cryopreservation. The complex interdependent associations between a host and its resident gut microbiota is
becoming increasingly important to interpreting pathobiological phenotypes of mutant mice. It is evident that
the gut microbiota plays a significant role in diseases such as obesity and cancer, but also in other roles such
as neuronal and immune development of the fetus. This exemplifies the importance of further research to
advance our understanding of the interplay between host-microbial relationships and conduct studies to
manipulate the microbiota to evaluate impact and changes on phenotypes. Users of the MMRRC have
expressed interest in using MMRRC mice for studies to better understand host-microbial relationships, through
being able to manipulate the gut microbiota and evaluate their influence on observable mutant phenotypes.
Therefore, our research project will compare rederiving microbiota from MMRRC mice into mice treated with
oral antibiotics maintained in a normal conventional facility environment compared to germ-free mice
maintained in a gnotobiotic facility. To improve the process even further, instead of simply doing fecal
transfaunation, we are going to refine the procedure by doing regional specific transfaunation. We hypothesize
that by separately collecting the upper and lower GI contents and later transplanting them via gavage and
intracolonic administration, respectively, the recolonization will better recapitulate the original microflora
regional differences. To test this, we will conduct the following aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop a reliable
protocol for the collection, archiving, and rederivation of GI region-specific microbiota using a bi-inoculation
(gavage and intracolonic administration) approach in wildtype mice. Specific Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of
GI region-specific manipulation of microbial communities in mouse strains submitted to the MMRRC. Our
expectation is that regional archiving of GI contents and bi-inoculation transfaunation will result in the MMRRC
developing and implementing novel broad-based strategies to optimize rigor and reproducibility of rederived
mouse models and microbiota. Results from this study will directly respond to users requests for additional
microbiota resources, assist our consortium partners in expanding their MMRRC resources, and address the
MMRRC’s current deficiency in being able to provide evidence-based recommendation for microbiota
rederivation inoculation approaches."
10766268,"ABSTRACT: Project 3, Multi-omic analysis to expand phenotype in MMRRC mice
Established by the NIH 20 years ago, the MMRRC serves the biomedical research community by preserving,
protecting, and promoting the considerable national investment in creating and phenotyping mutant mouse
models for the study of human biology and disease. With a census today exceeding 60,000 alleles, the
MMRRC ensures that unique and scientifically valuable mouse strains produced and studied in independent PI
laboratories can be deposited and archived for safekeeping so that they are available and accessible in
perpetuity for scientists to obtain and use for their research studies. But the phenotypic description of mutant
mice submitted to the MMRRC often narrowly reflects the specific scientific interests of the submitting
investigator, reflecting the focus of the researcher who developed the line. Therefore, the phenotypic repertoire
of many (if not most) MMRRC lines is far more diverse than what is known. For that reason, anything the
MMRRC can do to expose these hidden phenotypes will at least add new knowledge about a line, some (if not
most) of which will be scientifically valuable. Therefore, this project will pilot the feasibility of conducting
relatively high-throughput, low cost, and unbiased phenotyping analyses to each mouse line submitted to the
MMRRC. To that end, we propose to use extant, in-house transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic
platforms to establish a reliable and cost-effective protocol for high-fidelity multi-omic analysis of mouse tissues
from MMRRC mice. We will conduct this study in two aims over the course of 5 years. The first aim will
establish and test procedures in wildtype mice, and in the second aim apply the protocol to reveal new
phenotypes in MMRRC strains. We expect that comprehensive multi-omic characterization of submitted mouse
lines will not only contribute to validating what is already known (i.e., reproducibility and reliability) but also will
add an abundance of new phenotypic knowledge about MMRRC mouse lines. With this additional molecular
information, the research utility of mutant mouse lines held by the MMRRC Consortium will increase, resulting
in a growth in requests and greater use by the research community, and enhancing the distribution activity of
the resource."
10972804,"Project Summary
 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) including stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are
 overlapping global pandemics. CVD is the most common cause of death in patients with T2D and the economic
 burden of stroke and myocardial ischemia in patients with T2D is staggering. While newer glycemic control
 agents like SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists can help reduce CVD events in T2D, significant residual CVD
risk remains. Stroke and MI most often occur when a platelet-rich thrombus form at the site of a ruptured
 atherosclerotic plaque, occluding the vessel lumen, and resulting in downstream ischemia. There are at least
 four classes of drugs available to inhibit platelet rich thrombi formation including aspirin, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors,
and thrombin receptor inhibitors. While current antiplatelet drugs can reduce CVD events and death, their
 therapeutic potential is limited by major bleeding. Thus, there is a large unmet clinical and commercial need
 for a drug that improves glycemic control in T2D and also safely prevents cerebral and coronary vascular
 thrombosis. Senseion Therapeutics Inc. has been developing novel glycemic control agents derived from a tool
 compound SN-401 (SN-4XX) targeting LRRC8 proteins. In the course of developing these T2D therapeutics,
 we discovered human genetic evidence implicating LRRC8 regulation of platelet function in humans. We
 then validated LRRC8 proteins as a target for antiplatelet activity using targeted mouse genetics, and confirmed
both in vitro and in vivo antiplatelet/antithrombotic activity of a novel SN-401 derived compound that also
demonstrates glycemic control activity. We propose that SN-4XX compounds represent a first-in-class
 therapeutic approach with dual glycemic control and antithrombotic activity. We anticipate these drugs
 to fill a large unmet clinical need to improve glycemic control in T2D and also safely prevent cerebral
 and coronary vascular thrombosis, reducing the large residual risk of CVD events associated with T2D.
 Phase 1 AIMS:
· AIM 1: Evaluate previously synthesized compounds for in vitro antiplatelet and in vivo antithrombotic
activity.
· AIM 2: Complete in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity.
 Phase 2 AIMS:
· AIM 1: Perform in vivo oral dosing pharmacokinetics, in vitro ion channel selectivity studies, and in vivo
 dose range-finding toxicity studies.
· AIM 2: Perform pre-clinical SN-4XX dose-response, head-to-head efficacy, combination therapy and
 reversibility for antithrombotic activity versus bleeding.
· AIM 3: Manufacture the lead SN-4XX compound under cGMP conditions required for all IND-enabling
 studies, at least Phase I clinical studies, and all 24-month stability studies."

This proposal is the competing continuation of the University of Pittsburgh T32 Training Program in
Cardiovascular Epidemiology funded by NHLBI since 2008. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading
cause of death despite a >50% decline in age-adjusted CVD mortality in the past 6 decades. Unfortunately,
recent reports suggest that CVD mortality is plateauing. This Program thus addresses the critical need to
promote epidemiological research of CVD. The primary goal of our Program is to train individuals in CVD
epidemiology, based on pathophysiological understanding and experiential learning, who are skilled and
inspired to improve on existing and develop new prevention strategies. Our philosophy is to provide a core
foundation of didactic training in epidemiology focusing on subclinical atherosclerosis, and CVD
biomarkers/outcomes with strong methodological skills, customized to each trainee. Our Program is organized
around 3 Research Cores: 1) subclinical atherosclerosis, 2) biostatistics & epidemiological methods and 3)
CVD biomarkers/outcomes, grounded in 6 areas of strength: 1) vascular aging, 2) women’s health, 3) high-risk
& international populations, 4) nutrition & environment, 5) physical activity and 6) psychosocial factors. To
address novel opportunities in epidemiological research, for this competing renewal, our Program plans to
expand our programmatic focus on and incorporate experiences for trainees in using Big Data and omics for
which we have rich faculty expertise. Doing so will position our trainees to be independent CVD
epidemiologists in a multidisciplinary research setting, competent in traditional and novel epidemiological
methods. Trainees will have a primary mentor, work closely with other faculty members and be assigned a
more experienced trainee peer mentor. The Program consists of coursework, research field work and
professional development, all individually tailored to each trainee. Research fieldwork includes data collection,
management and analysis. Professional development includes remote training, grant writing experience,
manuscript preparation, participation in national conferences, skill development workshops and training in the
Responsible Conduct of Research. The Program is designed to produce investigators skilled in a
multidisciplinary approach to research in cardiovascular epidemiology, who are comfortable with using
subclinical atherosclerosis, or CVD biomarkers/outcomes data in cross-discipline collaborations. This Program
will continue to include 4 pre-doctoral and 2 post-doctoral positions in epidemiology."

its progression and response to treatment. New treatment innovations are discovered by a dedicated group of
VA scientists and clinicians who study the pathomechanisms of disease. Key discoveries utilize machine
learning and artificial intelligence in combination with advanced ocular imaging to elucidate structure and
function of the eye and central nervous system. Resulting discoveries provide important, clinically relevant
biomarkers of eye and neurologic disorders. These include reflex movements of the eyes, pupils, eyelids and
facial muscles of expression in three dimensions for objective diagnosis and monitoring of treatment. Many
diseases of the nervous system, cardiovascular system and immune system are manifested in the eye, making
it an ideal platform to detect, monitor and develop new treatments for ocular and systemic disorders affecting
Veterans. The Center’s mission of prevention and treatment of visual loss is carried out in 3 main spheres of
research that synergistically support one another:
Focus Area 1: Rehabilitation of Vision Loss
Many aspects of ocular disease resulting in vision loss remain incompletely understood. Discovery of damage
mechanisms informs new treatments for diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, glaucoma, optic nerve disorders
and ocular and systemic vascular disorders.
Focus Area 2: Ocular Biomarkers for Rehabilitation of Central Nervous System Disease
Many central nervous system diseases also affect ocular structure and function and these changes are often
detectable prior to onset of neurologic symptoms. Non-invasive tests of visual function and structure can
provide early and readily quantifiable biomarkers indicative of associated neurologic deficits.
Focus Area 3: Technology Development for Automated Telemedical Assessment of Ocular Disorders
and Assistive technologies
Development of technologies to detect structure and function of the eye for diagnosis, staging and monitoring
responses to treatment of visual disorders and related central nervous system degenerations. Such
technologies allow in-home monitoring of disease progression and treatment responses by patients.
Furthermore, technologies are developed that enable reliable eye examinations in community clinics for
interpretation by specialists located elsewhere. Finally, assistive technologies are being developed using three-
dimensional soundscape input from the visual environment to aid veterans with low vision.
 While research in the CPTVL ranges from the use of cell culture and preclinical models to instrument
development and clinical trials, all initiatives are linked to readouts of vision and neurologic function that quality
life metrics in Veterans. By doing so, we intend to discover which readouts have the largest impact on quality
of life and quality of vision. This will provide much needed insight into which visual functions hold the greatest
importance as outcome measures. The linking of readouts of vision to quality of life can be individualized for
personalized medicine initiatives.

10915555,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Together with the ability to measure genome-wide expression of millions of individual cells, single-cell
technologies have also brought the challenge of translating such data into a better understanding of the
underlying biological phenomena. Existing computational methods and software for single-cell data analysis
have critical limitations related to scalability, accuracy, usability, and interpretation capabilities. The main goal of
this project is to pioneer a new platform for the analysis of single-cell data that is capable of: i) accurately
identifying cell types and their composition in complex tissues, ii) inferring cell developmental stages and pseudo-
time trajectories, and iii) identifying cell-type-specific pathways and putative mechanisms in a phenotype
comparison. The proposed platform will also be able to deconvolve bulk expression data to identify the cell type
composition of each bulk sample. The significance of the proposed work lies in its potential to provide new
methodologies for single-cell data analysis that far exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art techniques.
The accurate deconvolution will also allow researchers to extract more information from the vast repositories of
existing bulk data, including GDC/TCGA, NCBI SRA, GEO, and ArrayExpress, which are currently containing
data from bulk experiments that collectively cost over a billion dollars. The hypothesis driving this work is that
single-cell data analysis and cellular deconvolution of bulk data can greatly benefit from: i) the systems-level
knowledge that holds key characteristics for cellular developments, and ii) the valuable information available in
validated cell types and reference single-cell datasets available in single-cell atlases. Indeed, our preliminary
work shows that single-cell data analysis and cellular deconvolution can achieve an outstanding accuracy of
approximately 90—100% if we properly utilize reference single-cell datasets and pathway knowledge. The
proposed platform will be extensively validated by comparing its capabilities against the state-of-the-art software
in both single-cell data analysis (cell type identification, developmental states and time-trajectory inference,
systems-level analysis) and cellular deconvolution of bulk expression data. This will be done using both 663
datasets representing 279 cell types and 116 human organ parts (including bulk data, single-cell data, and
matched cell flow cytometry). The pathway analysis and mechanisms inference capabilities will be further
validated using real knock-out datasets (in which the true cause of the phenotype is known). The company,
Advaita, has a strong IP portfolio, an experienced team, and a proven track record in this area, having developed
and commercialized similar analysis platforms. Advaita's existing products are currently used by top principal
investigators, core facilities, and pharmaceutical companies around the world."

10772049,"Project Summary – Core B: TRANSCRIPTOME AND NETWORK ANALYSIS CORE
The advent of high-throughput omics technologies enables powerful analyses of cellular transcriptional
programs, gene-function relationships and genome-wide surveys at unprecedented detail. Individual
investigators face many hurdles in implementing these new technologies and effectively translating these large
datasets into mechanistic understanding of molecular pathways. The goal of the Transcriptome and Network
Analysis Core (TNAC) is to facilitate the effective use of omics technologists and the downstream
bioinformatics analyses. This core leverages the expertise of Dr. Gonzalez Hernandez, Director of the SDSU
Genomics Sequencing Facility, with expertise in genetics and genomics analysis, and Dr. Xijin Ge,
experienced bioinformatician and biomedical researcher. Specifically, this core will enable the project leads to
use the following technology to study inflammation: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), CRISPR whole genome
screening, spatially resolved RNA-seq, and proteomics. The TNAC has 3 specific aims: 1) Transcriptomic
analyses by conventional RNA-Seq and deep sequencing for analysis of CRISPR insertions; 2) The use of
spatially resolved and single cell RNA-seq technology and associated bioinformatics workflows; and 3) Data
integration and extensive pathway analysis using and adapting bioinformatics tools and resources, including
those developed by Dr. Xijin Ge, to construct gene regulatory networks underlying inflammation, integrate
proteomics data, and conduct meta-analysis of data generated by the three projects alongside data in the
public domain. This core is innovative in that it brings together cutting-edge experimental technology with the
latest bioinformatics tools and approaches. Working closely with the four project leads, this core will exemplify
interdisciplinary collaboration, and significantly promote the adoption of cutting-edge technologies among
biomedical researchers in the region."
10746454,"Title: The role of neutrophil YAP in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion inflammation and injury
Student: Jamie Francisco, M.S.
Mentor: Dr. Dominic Del Re, PhD.
Abstract: Myocardial Infarction (MI) is the number one cause of death worldwide, claiming
more lives than the three most prevalent cancers combined. While reperfusion is currently the
gold standard treatment of ischemic injury in the heart, it paradoxically worsens cardiac
outcomes by increasing inflammation and apoptosis, furthering myocyte loss and expanding the
infarct. Despite being a major contributor to worsening cardiac outcomes, there are no available
treatments for this secondary injury caused by reperfusion, presenting a major limitation in the
treatment of MI. Neutrophils are among the first inflammatory cells recruited to the heart after
injury and their numbers have been shown to positively correlate to infarct size. Although
neutrophils contribute to acute inflammation and infarct expansion, neutrophil depletion results
in defective cardiac repair after infarct. Therefore, further investigation into the mechanisms of
specific neutrophil functions is needed to regulate inflammation and improve cardiac outcomes
during reperfusion. The long-term goal of this research is to uncover novel therapeutic targets of
proinflammatory neutrophil functions to make possible targeted modulation of inflammation
without affecting repair during reperfusion. Previous investigations by our lab and others have
identified Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, as a
critical regulator of cardiac outcomes after ischemic heart injury. Preliminary data from our
newly generated neutrophil-specific YAP KO mouse (YAP F//F: MRP8-cre) show decreased infarct
size and inflammatory gene expression when compared to controls after acute
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). These data support our hypothesis that neutrophil YAP positively
regulates inflammation and therefore, cardiac injury, after I/R. The goal of the proposed study is
to define the role of YAP in specific pro-inflammatory neutrophil functions and the subsequent
effect on cardiac injury during reperfusion to improve cardiac outcomes after I/R injury. To
investigate this, we propose the following aims: 1) Determine cardiac injury and post infarct
inflammatory status in neutrophil-specific YAP KO mice, 2) Determine the effect of YAP
expression on neutrophil function during reperfusion and investigate the underlying mechanism.
Upon completion, we will have elucidated the role of YAP in specific neutrophil proinflammatory
functions during cardiac reperfusion. Furthermore, we believe these studies will reveal novel
therapeutic targets for the modulation of inflammation without affecting the repair mechanism in
the heart. As the injury due to reperfusion currently has no effective treatment, the results of this
work could advance the field toward improved therapeutic options for MI patients."
10746459,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Primary cutaneous gamma delta T cell lymphomas (PCGDTLs) are a collection of highly aggressive, incurable
non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the skin-homing γδ T cell. Median survival is 31 months. Five-year survival is 19.9%.
Without a fundamental understanding of disease pathophysiology, there has been little progress in the last few
decades. A critical unmet need is to uncover novel therapeutic targets via elucidation of basic disease
mechanisms. Lymphoma phenotypes are determined by a combination of somatic mutations and cell of origin.
To elucidate the genomic, transcriptional, and cellular origins of PCGDTLs, we have assembled a large, multi-
institutional cohort of samples representing diverse clinical phenotypes. By analyzing high-dimensional genomic
and immunological data, we hypothesize that we can identify the molecular basis of this disease. Importantly,
these studies represent a serendipitous opportunity to elucidate the biology of skin-resident gamma delta T cells,
a poorly understood but likely important lymphocyte in human skin."
10900773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite recent progress, accelerated implementation of highly effective and sustainable public health policies
will be required to meet the Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDG) targets for maternal and child health by
2030. The broad goal of this application is to continue to participate in all collaborative activities relevant to the
mission of the Global Network (GN), which aims to develop and test potential sustainable interventions through
collaborative, large-scale, high impact multi-site common research protocols. The primary objective of our
research unit (RU), which represents a partnership between the University of Colorado and Guatemala, is to
develop and test interventions to mitigate the priority threats to maternal-child health posed by malnutrition and
infection in the context of the rapidly changing environment. The specific research expertise of our team is
nutrition, infectious diseases, and biological effects of environmental stressors. This objective will be met
through the following specific aims: 1) continue and enhance a strong research record and productivity as GN
members; 2) continue to develop common GN protocols through high-impact clinical trials and observational
studies that are transformative for maternal-child health; and 3) continue to foster a progressively stronger
research partnership with our colleagues and collaborators in Guatemala and other GN sites. During the past
5-yr cycle, this RU has built a strong research record, evidenced by more than 60 GN publications
(approximately 40% led by our team); by completion of longitudinal growth and neurodevelopment follow-up
through 2 years in the four sites of the preconception maternal nutrition intervention trial; actively consulting on
child neurodevelopmental follow-up for two other major GN trials; strengthened research capacity in
Guatemala; successful implementation of all GN-initiated common protocols, including COVID-19 surveillance,
with contribution of a high percentage of participant numbers and retention to each study; initiation of analyses
to demonstrate adverse effects of maternal exposure to high ambient temperatures on fetal growth and birth
outcomes; and securing external funding to support common protocol implementation. Major contributions to
the GN by this RU include service on 2 subcommittees and co-chairing the oversight committee for the
ongoing Maternal Newborn Health Registry. The positive impact of our continued participation in the GN will be
accomplished by leveraging our combined expertise in nutrition, infectious diseases, and environmental
stressors to design interventions to improve maternal, infant, and child health and resilience within the context
of a changing environment."
10772974,"Nerve infiltration has been implicated in the formation and progression of several solid tumor types
including prostate, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. However, despite its neural origin, melanoma
innervation has not been previously reported. In our preliminary studies, we discovered that melanoma
tumor tissues from patient samples and mouse models are highly innervated. This innervation is
dependent on tumor cell expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), as targeted NGF depletion eliminates
intratumoral nerve fibers. Importantly, melanoma denervation via NGF knockdown or chemical
sympathectomy dramatically reduces tumor burdens by remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME).
This TME reprogramming is associated with increased cytokine and chemokine expression, CD103+ DC
activation, and CD8+ T cell recruitment, suggesting that NGF or nerve-derived neurotransmitters support
tumor growth by suppressing antitumor immunity. Importantly, we confirmed this inverse correlation
between tumor innervation and inflammation using clinical samples: melanomas expressing low levels of
NGF are immunologically hot and associated with improved patient survival. These findings inspire our
central hypothesis that NGF-mediated innervation of the tumor microenvironment can be exploited
pharmacologically to reverse immunosuppression. In this study, we will test this hypothesis with the
following three aims: Aim 1 will dissect molecular mechanisms of NGF-mediated remodeling of the
intratumor immune microenvironment. Aim 2 will dissect molecular mechanisms by which NGF regulates
T cell activation. Aim 3 will determine the pre-clinical efficacy of a therapeutic strategy combining NGF
axis inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade against melanoma. Findings from the proposed studies
will lay the foundation upon which potential combinational therapies can be developed to combat this
disease."
10922803,"ABSTRACT
Mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability from cells to networks across the Alzheimer's disease (AD)
spectrum remain unknown, limiting our understanding of disease and hampering development of effective
therapies. We propose to identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) network dysfunctions in brain cells and regions
as a gateway to selective vulnerability mechanisms in AD. To gain systems level insights, we propose to leverage
our discoveries in stress biology linking interactome network perturbations to the formation of long-lived
oligomeric scaffolds termed epichaperomes, and to employ a novel `omics platform called epichaperomics that
provides direct information on PPI network changes. Preliminary studies indicate epichaperomes change how
thousands of proteins interact and negatively impact PPI networks important for neuronal function, including
synaptic plasticity, cell-to-cell communication, protein translation, cell cycle re-entry, axon guidance, metabolic
processes and inflammation, leading to cell and connectome-wide dysfunction and cognitive decline. Parallel
studies in transgenic mice and iPSC-derived neurons demonstrate epichaperome formation is a key event that
negatively impacts cellular function, from early prodromal disease stages and throughout disease progression.
Preliminary results in transgenic mice and postmortem AD brains suggest epichaperome formation occurs
principally within vulnerable brain cells and regions. Accordingly, we hypothesize epichaperome formation, and
in turn of epichaperome-mediated PPI network imbalances, over decades, not only results in defects within
intrinsic neuronal proteins and protein pathways but also intercellularly, where it disrupts intrinsic network
connectivity of cells and of brain circuits. We posit vulnerable neurons and brain regions have a higher propensity
to accumulate epichaperomes, and epichaperome-mediated dysfunctions. In accordance with NOT-AG-21-040,
we propose to uncover mechanisms of PPI dysfunctions within individual brain cells and regions as a portal into
selective vulnerability in AD, which remains unknown and a key missing piece. We aim to i) investigate
mechanisms that enable (i.e., epichaperomes, Aim 1) and ii) those that execute (i.e., impacted proteins and
protein pathways, Aim 2) context-specific dysfunctions in PPI networks. As a key element in linking stressors-to-
phenotype, we aim to uncover cell- and region-specific vulnerabilities within PPI networks induced by individual
stressors (Aim 3). Results provide first-of-a-kind insights into the spatio-temporal formation and distribution of
epichaperomes across the AD spectrum and their relationship to clinical, pathologic, and genetic vulnerabilities.
Outcomes are critical proteome-wide insights into interactome vulnerabilities, both on the nature and trajectory
within vulnerable brain cells and brain regions. Raw datasets and data analytics will be deposited directly into
free access sites for mining and hypothesis testing by members of the scientific community. In addition to defining
technically challenging mechanistic insights into selective AD vulnerabilities, innovation includes diagnostics and
therapeutics, as epichaperome-mediated dysfunctions are both imageable and targetable."

10835100,"Project Summary / Abstract
Our brain provides us with a sense of where we are in space. The importance of this sense is clear when we
become spatially disoriented, like when one is confused about one’s orientation after exiting a subway station.
Central to the understanding of how brains give rise to spatial cognition has been the discovery of place cells in
the 1970’s (i.e., neurons that are active when animals are in one location in space), head-direction cells in the
1980’s (i.e., neurons that are active when animals face one compass direction), and grid cells in the early
2000’s (i.e., neurons that are active when animals are in a grid of locations in space). A fundamental next step
in our understanding of spatial cognition would be to describe the circuit-level interactions that give rise to such
physiological activity patterns and to understand how such signals ultimately influence navigational behavior.
We wish to leverage the advanced genetic, behavioral, anatomical and physiological tools in Drosophila, to
achieve three broad goals. First, we wish to rigorously characterize neural circuits that explain how
navigational signals are built. Second, we wish to improve the tasks that flies perform while we record from
their brain, which will allow us to isolate cells and circuits required for the formation of spatial working
memories. Third, we aim to reveal molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms by which such memories are
formed and guide behavior. This work should allow us to more rigorously link molecular factors, through their
effects on cells and circuits, to their function in spatial-cognition. Our discoveries should ultimately help to
inform how humans perform navigational tasks like driving home from work or finding a car in a parking lot,
alongside how to approach neurological conditions in which such abilities are impaired, like in Alzheimer’s
disease."

With three R1 universities and multiple research institutions, the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area is awash
with academic innovation but needs to attract more early-stage biopharma specific capital and more “bio-
entrepreneurs” trained to link university-based projects to the know-how and funding that can launch a
biomedical application into the emerging ecosystem. The Chicago Biomedical Consortium (CBC), a
philanthropically funded research consortium between the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), the University
of Chicago (UC), and Northwestern University (NU) was founded in 2006, reimagined in 2016, and renewed
in 2022 to bridge the Academic Innovator’s (AcIns) knowledge gap from idea to clinical implementation. Led
by Northwestern University, anchored on CBC infrastructure that has developed diverse cohorts of PhD trained
Entrepreneurial Fellows (EFs) and enabled translational awards across the three major Chicago universities,
incorporating clinical translational expertise from a multi-campus network, and making such services available
across nine Chicago research institutions, the Chicago Biomedical Consortium Hub for Innovative
Technology and Entrepreneurship in the Sciences (CBC-HITES) will build a scaled multi-campus, academic
service center for AcIns who want to develop biopharma small molecules, biologics, and new
diagnostic/therapeutic modalities (e.g. cell and genetic therapies).
The CBC-HITES will provide Chicago’s AcIns with multiple services, starting with the Request for Applications
(RFA) stage and culminating in project execution. Under expert supervision by ex-industry personnel and a
professional biopharmaceutical project manager, the center’s EFs will develop the AcIns’ ideas into industry
grade analyses and project plans. Analyses are scientifically and clinically validated and, ultimately, validated by
the end buyer, through an EF/AcIn joint presentation to a venture External Review Board (venture ERB) to
inform funding. CBC – HITES’s leadership includes physician/surgeon scientists and expert drug hunters with
connections to the city’s Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA)s, community physician groups
and healthcare organizations to better integrate clinical perspectives with deep discovery capabilities. The center
also incorporates regulatory and implementation science into the hub.
Projects funded by CBC-HITES will engage VC 1-2 years before equity financing is needed, and, depending on
when they are screened out, unfunded projects receive a large body of research and a gap analysis that can be
used for resubmission or alternative funding. VC are connected to promising AcIns and curated research,
making their jobs easier. During their one to two years of training, EFs are networked to the universities, each
other, and the broader ecosystem and then go to work in Chicago’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, pulling more
academic assets out of the universities and thus maximizing the utility of their training. Intentionally recruiting
diverse cohorts of EFs enables a strong, inclusive bioeconomy that can attract VC funding and more talent."
10783576,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are ~1 billion human influenza cases worldwide each year, resulting in up to 650,000 deaths. Influenza
virus infects cells of the airways and distal lung, causing acute lung injury. The main class of antiviral drugs
recommended for treating influenza works by blocking the viral neuraminidase enzyme on the virus surface to
prevent the release of viral particles from infected cells. However, the increasing emergence of drug resistance
limits their effectiveness. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular regulators and
pathways of the innate immune response in the lung against influenza virus infection. This proposal is driven
by our novel finding that the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH10, a protein never described in the lungs in the
context of influenza virus infection with no known role in pulmonary immunity, is significantly downregulated by
influenza virus infection in human and murine lungs. Overexpression of MARCH10 also drastically decreases
the viral protein influenza hemagglutinin when lung epithelial cells are infected with influenza virus. We
hypothesize that MARCH10, regulated at the transcriptional level, decreases influenza pathogenesis and is a
critical regulator of airway epithelial cell host defense. We have proposed the following specific aims to
investigate this hypothesis: 1) Determine if influenza virus induces a stage-specific decrease in MARCH10 at
the gene transcriptional level and 2) Determine if catalytically active MARCH10 reduces influenza virus
pathogenesis via post-transcriptional mechanisms. To accomplish these goals, the principal investigator has
developed a five-year training program under the guidance of her mentors, Dr. Rama Mallampalli – an expert
in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and acute lung injury and Dr. Jacob Yount - an expert in influenza and viral
immunology, to acquire training in advanced molecular and cell biology techniques, virology techniques, and
small animal model development. The candidate’s training will also be overseen by a Scientific Advisory
Committee to lend expertise, provide oversight and evaluate progress, including, Dr. Mallampalli, Dr. Yount,
Dr. Estelle Cormet-Boyaka – an expert in lung epithelial cell biology, and Dr. Dan Wozniak – an expert in lung
and bacterial pathogenesis. The proposed career development plan will provide the additional training
necessary to achieve the principal investigator’s ultimate goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist
studying the biological mechanisms by which lung epithelial cells respond to respiratory viral infections and
modulate the lung innate immune response and translate these findings into novel therapeutics to prevent and
treat viral infections and its associated lung injury."

This five-year K01 is a mixed-methods research project that will be conducted in three phases (development,
optimization, feasibility) in collaboration with Boys & Girls Clubs (BGC). The candidate, Dr. Ashleigh Johnson,
has identified a mentorship team and training goals to facilitate her development as an independent researcher
focused on culturally tailoring community-based interventions to reduce youth physical activity (PA) disparities.
Background: Fewer than 30% of elementary-aged youth meet PA guidelines, with lower activity levels found
among girls, racial minorities, and those living in rural areas. Sport is one of the best strategies for promoting
PA, yet girls, Hispanics, and rural populations participate in youth sport at lower numbers and drop out at a
higher rate. In line with Self-Determination Theory (SDT), commonly cited barriers include lack of competence,
autonomy, and relatedness. Physical literacy and sport sampling have also been identified as key determinants
of youth sport participation. Developing interventions around physical literacy and sport sampling, with
intervention delivery grounded in SDT principles, is a promising strategy for promoting youth sport. However,
the few existing interventions aimed to promote girls’ PA through sport were developed outside the US,
focused on adolescent (versus younger) girls, and/or conducted among urban or suburban youth, limiting
generalizability. Rural, Hispanic girls face unique challenges around sport that should be identified and
addressed, yet there remains a paucity of information on determinants of sport participation among this
population. Objective: To use Human-centered Design strategies to develop a tailored sport sampling and
physical literacy intervention (Girls PLAY), in collaboration with BGC, and examine the impact on girls’ PA.
BGC is an organization that provides learning and leadership programs to millions of rural youth nationwide,
about half of whom are girls. Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Develop a tailored BGC intervention (Girls PLAY); (Aim 2)
optimize Girls PLAY using live prototyping; and (Aim 3) determine feasibility of the Girls PLAY intervention.
This work is highly significant in that increasing sport participation via BGC can reduce disparities in PA due to
gender, race, and rurality. Findings will inform continued intervention development and broader
implementation. Results from this study will also be used to pursue R01 funding for a larger scale efficacy trial.
Training and Mentorship: Dr. Johnson will receive training in: 1) community-engaged research; 2) culturally-
tailored intervention development; and 3) implementation science. She has assembled an interdisciplinary
mentorship team (Dr. Elva Arredondo, primary mentor; Drs. Emily Kroshus and Jason Bocarro, co-mentors)
with expertise in PA, community-engaged research, intervention development, youth sports, and rural
populations to ensure completion of the training plan and proposed research. This K01 Award will support Dr.
Johnson’s development as an independent investigator who identifies and addresses multi-level factors of PA
and sport participation among underserved populations in order to promote PA throughout the life course."

10788431,"Biomolecules, such as nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, are nanoscale in size, and often localized with
nanoscale precision with respect to each other, and to cellular structures. Analyzing the nanoscale
configurations of biomolecules in cells and tissues is critical for understanding how they work, as well as how
they go wrong in disease states. Not surprisingly, much effort has been devoted to inventing methods (e.g.,
super-resolution microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy) for nanoimaging biological specimens, primarily in their
preserved state. However, all of these technologies require expensive equipment, and specialized skillsets.
Given that all biological systems involve nanoscale building blocks and their interactions, a major question is
whether nanoimaging can be democratized, so that anyone could do it, without expensive equipment or
extensive training. This grant is a first competitive renewal of our group’s primary grant that supports the
development of a technology that we think could potentially meet this goal. We recently announced that in
contrast to all previous methods for imaging preserved biological specimens, which magnify their images,
specimens could themselves be physically magnified. This technology, which we call expansion microscopy
(ExM), involves equipping key biomolecules or labels within a specimen with anchoring molecules, then
densely and evenly permeating the biological specimen with a mesh of swellable polymer (that binds to the
anchors, thus anchoring key biomolecules or labels to the polymer), softening the specimen to disrupt
endogenous molecular interactions, and adding water to swell the polymer, which in turn pulls the
biomolecules or labels apart from each other. The process is even down to the nanoscale, and thus enables
nanoimaging of cells and tissues on ordinary microscopes. In addition, several recent papers point to an
additional advantage of ExM – by pulling biomolecules apart from each other, you decrowd them for better
labeling by fluorescent probes, sometimes turning invisible biomolecules into visible ones. ExM is already in
use by many hundreds of research groups, with over 250 experimental preprints and papers appearing to date.
Here we propose to make ExM simpler, more powerful, faster, more applicable to human samples, and more
precise in resolution. Specifically, we will (Aim 1) create a unified, simple, high-speed ExM protocol; (Aim 2)
create a unified, simple, high-speed, single-step 20x expansion protocol; (Aim 3) optimize the new unified,
simple, and high-speed ExM protocols for human tissues. We propose a fast-paced, 4 year, technology
development grant, with the goal of delivering, to the entire biology and medical community, a truly
democratized toolbox that enables anyone to do nanoimaging. We will share all protocols as freely as possible
both on the web and through protocol papers, as well as through hosting people at hands-on workshops."
10788432,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Trophoblast cell derivatives of the embryo contribute to restructuring the uterine environment, an event
required for the establishment of a successful pregnancy. The rat and human each possess a uterine-
placental interface that is characterized by deep intrauterine infiltration of trophoblast cells, which contribute to
dynamic changes in uterine immune cell, endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell, and stromal cell constituents.
This important developmental process is directed by specialized trophoblast cells possessing invasive
properties with the potential of targeting maternal cells within the uterine compartment. In the human, these
invasive trophoblast cells are referred to as extravillous trophoblast (EVT). Disruptions in differentiation of the
invasive trophoblast/EVT cell lineage, intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion, and/or trophoblast cell-directed
uterine cell modulation contribute to early pregnancy loss, placental dysfunction, pregnancy-related diseases,
and a range of postnatal health issues. The project focuses on placenta specific 1 (PLAC1), an intrinsic
regulator of placentation. Our long-term goal is to elucidate regulatory processes controlling development of
the invasive trophoblast/EVT cell lineage and its role in establishing the uterine-placental interface. In this
project, our efforts are focused on two aims. In Aim 1, we dissect the actions of PLAC1 in the establishment of
the invasive trophoblast cell lineage. In Aim 2 we investigate trophoblast cell-uterine cell crosstalk and
plasticity at the uterine-placental interface. Experimentation utilizes genetically manipulated loss-of-function rat
models, trophoblast stem cells, and genome-wide analyses of transcriptomes and chromatin landscapes.
Execution of this research project will facilitate elucidation of molecular pathways controlling trophoblast-guided
transformation of the uterine environment and will create a platform for understanding the pathogenesis of
early pregnancy loss and placental anomalies leading to pregnancy disorders."
10788435,"Summary/Abstract
Fungal pathogens have an enormous impact on human health worldwide. In the U.S. alone, bloodstream
infections have increased by over 200% in recent decades, associated with an increasing number of people with
compromised immune function due to treatment for cancer, organ transplantation, and HIV. Poor clinical
outcome for most invasive fungal infections is attributable to the very limited number of effective antifungals
available and the emergence of clinical resistance to each of the three main modes of action they target.
Protein kinases have emerged as richly rewarding targets in the development of drugs for diverse diseases,
ranging from cancer to metabolic disorders, but kinases as a class have remained completely untapped in the
quest for new antifungals. To begin to fill this void, we tested a panel of well-characterized, structurally diverse
kinase inhibitors for activity against a drug-resistant isolate of Candida albicans, the most common human fungal
pathogen. This screen identified several compounds which were active against C. albicans and the emerging
pathogen, Candida auris. Using chemical genomic approaches, we established the primary target of our most
active compounds as Yck2, a fungal member of the widely expressed casein kinase 1 (CK1) family. Using
genetic techniques, we confirmed that Yck2 is required for growth in culture under host-relevant conditions, is
required to maintain echinocandin-resistance in culture, and enables the virulence of echinocandin-resistant C.
albicans in both immune-competent and immune-compromised mice. Now, we will exploit selectivity handles
revealed by co-crystal structures of the Yck2 kinase domain in complex with our lead and several other inhibitors
to optimize potency, fungal selectivity, and pharmacological properties. Pursuing two scaffolds in parallel as a
de-risking strategy, our goal is to deliver one or more advanced leads for future development of a clinical drug
candidate. To achieve this goal, our multidisciplinary team will use its expertise in chemistry, structural biology,
pharmacology, and fungal biology to pursue the following aims:
AIM 1: Structure-enabled synthesis of Yck2 inhibitors with improved antifungal activity
AIM 2: Optimize cellular and whole animal pharmacology of fungal Yck2 inhibitors
AIM 3: Evaluate tolerability and efficacy in mouse models of systemic fungal infection by drug-resistant clinical
 isolates with and without concurrent sub-therapeutic echinocandin treatment
The Yck2 inhibitors we develop in achieving these aims are expected to possess single agent activity in vivo as
well as reverse/prevent resistance to echinocandins. The development of these compounds will be invaluable
not only from the perspective of establishing a new target space for discovery and development of
mechanistically distinct single-agent antifungals but also in pioneering a resistance-aversive combination
approach to antifungal therapy that has proven essential in controlling other infectious diseases."
10784015,"ABSTRACT
Family caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) has a serious
emotional, physical, and financial toll. Latino family caregivers of individuals with ADRD experience a
disproportionately poorer mental health than non-Latino Whites and are less likely to access caregiver support.
Text messaging can dramatically enhance the access of effective culturally and linguistically tailored caregiver
support interventions among Latinos. However, to our knowledge, no text message interventions exist to
provide caregiver support among caregivers of individuals with ADRD. To address this need, we developed
CuidaTEXT (Spanish for self-care and texting; cuídate + text) using a set of user-centered principles.
CuidaTEXT is a bilingual (English and Spanish) 6-month text message intervention that includes daily
automatic messages tailored to Latino caregivers. All caregivers receive one core daily automatic message on
five domains: ADRD education, social support, self-care, ADRD care management, and behavioral symptoms.
Caregivers can access on-demand automatic messages to expand on the five domains by sending keywords
and interact with a coach via a live chat for more personalized help. Preliminary findings from our one-arm
feasibility study (n=24) showed CuidaTEXT was highly usable with high levels of satisfaction and engagement,
increased preparedness for caregiving and approach-coping, and decreased caregiver behavioral symptom
distress and depressive symptoms at 6 months. The next logical step is to assess the efficacy of CuidaTEXT.
Therefore, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of CuidaTEXT among Latinos.
This research corresponds with Stage 2 of the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development
(efficacy testing) and will also assess CuidaTEXT’s mechanisms of change informed by the Science of
Behavior Change, the Stress Process Framework, and our quantitative feasibility data. We will randomize
caregivers (n=144/arm) to 6 months of CuidaTEXT +1-month post-treatment or a 7-month waitlist control
group. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects of CuidaTEXT on Latino caregiver stressors and their negative
consequences (outcomes). Outcomes include change in caregiver depressive symptoms and behavioral
symptom distress from baseline to 6 months. In Aim 2, we will explore CuidaTEXT’s effects on ameliorating
factors of stress (targets). Targets include changes in caregiver approach-coping and preparedness for
caregiving from baseline to 6 months. In Aim 3, we will examine the mediation of ameliorating factors on
CuidaTEXT’s outcomes. We will test whether CuidaTEXT affects outcomes from Month 3 to 6 by engaging
targets from baseline to Month 3."
10784169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The objective of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic programs that give rise
to the development of specialized areas within the human cerebral cortex. Abnormalities in cortical
development can lead to a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders, which often affect different cortical
areas differently. Despite of its significance, the process by which specialized areas develop remains poorly
understood. This proposal aims to address this gap of knowledge by studying primary tissue and human stem
cell-derived brain organoids. The first aspect of the research will utilize spatially resolved transcriptome
analysis to examine human fetal cortex samples from multiple areas and embryonic ages, to identify the genes
that are involved in area-specific neuronal fate specification. The second part will focus on developing the
method for inducing areal identities in human brain organoids by pharmacological manipulation of signaling
pathways, serving as a model for how morphogens induce area-specific cell fates in vivo. The proposed aims
are attainable due to the strong background of the candidate and supportive environment provided by the
mentor’s laboratory and the institution. The anticipated outcome of this research will be new insights into the
principles of human cortical development, which could shed light on the etiology of neurodevelopmental
disorders and ultimately transform our understanding of cortical development in health and disease.
 The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent researcher in an academic institution, leading
a research program that utilizes human stem cell models and neurogenetics approaches to study
neurodevelopmental disorders. The candidate’s prior research in the development and application of organoids
as model for human brain development and diseases sets a strong foundation. The proposal outlines a
comprehensive plan for scientific and professional growth that encompasses hands-on training, didactics, and
mentorship. Key scientific training goals include acquiring expertise in single-cell bioinformatics, spatial
transcriptomics, disease genetics analysis, and conducting rigorous optimization of organoid protocols.
Additionally, the candidate will engage in structured trainings in career development to facilitate independence.
The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Christopher Walsh, a renowned neuroscientist who has mentored
dozens of successful independent investigators. The candidate will also benefit from the support of an advisory
committee with complementary expertise. The mentored phase of the proposal will take place in the laboratory
of Dr. Walsh at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, known for providing exceptional
research and training environments. The proposed training and research will provide the candidate with the
necessary resources and support to establish a thriving independent research program."
10784240,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eating and drinking are rapid processes, but their postingestive effects are slow and delayed. How do animals
correctly associate these delayed effects (detection of nutrients or toxins in the gut) with transient stimuli like
tastes and smells that precede them by minutes or hours? To gain insight into this question, I leveraged the
fact that mice learn to associate novel, but not familiar, foods with gastric malaise signals to investigate what
distinguishes the neural representations of flavors that promote learning versus those that do not. I surveyed
brainwide expression of the immediate early gene Fos during drinking and during postingestive malaise and
discovered that distinct functional networks of flavor-selective brain regions are recruited at different phases of
postingestive learning. This led to two key hypotheses about how the brain is able to link tastes and flavors to
delayed postingestive feedback. During the postdoctoral phase (K99/Aim 1) of this proposal, I will test the
hypothesis that an amygdala network centered on the central amygdala (CEA) represents novel flavors during
drinking and that this representation is then reactivated when postingestive feedback signals from the gut
arrive, providing temporal overlap between the flavor representation and feedback that promotes learning. I will
first use high-density Neuropixels recordings to demonstrate that CEA novel flavor representations are
reactivated during postingestive malaise (Aim 1.1) and then use optogenetic activation of CEA novel flavor
ensembles to show that these postingestive reactivations are sufficient to drive learning (Aim 1.2). In the
independent phase (R00/Aim 2), I will test the hypothesis that a limbic network centered on the lateral septum
(LS) blocks these novel flavor reactivations to gate the formation of postingestive associations when flavors are
recognized as familiar and safe. I will first use axon terminal photostimulation to identify the specific LS
projection that gates learning (Aim 2.1) and then combine this manipulation with high-density neural recordings
in downstream regions (Aim 2.2) and brainwide Fos imaging (Aim 2.3) to investigate how LS activity blocks the
formation and reactivation of novel flavor representations. These experiments will generate key insights into
the cross-region neural mechanisms that support conditioned taste aversion and postingestive learning. During
the K99 phase, I will gain crucial technical expertise — in Neuropixels electrophysiology, advanced
computational tools, and activity-dependent genetic labeling — and professional development that will be
essential for my independent lab’s mission. Our ultimate goal will be to uncover general principles by which
interoceptive signals engage the brain to control behavior and how the mechanisms underlying postingestive
learning go awry in eating disorders and obesity."

Grant (PPG) with mouse models necessary to achieve their specific aims, and will perform mouse lifespan
assays, drug treatments and characterize mouse phenotypes. The overarching goal of this PPG is to understand
the role of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons in age-related pathologies. In the current funding cycle, we discovered
that L1s trigger systemic inflammation by inducing an interferon response via the cGAS-STING pathway. Core
C was instrumental in showing that treatment of mice with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs
alleviates multiple pathologies and reduces inflammation. In the next funding cycle, we will focus on the role
of L1-mediated inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease and determine whether inhibition of L1s rescues AD
pathology in mouse models. Core C Specific Aims will be to: (1) Prepare and maintain the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee protocols for all projects within this PPG; (2) Generate a ‘bat-STING’ mouse model to
test whether dampened STING signaling alleviates AD pathology. This will be done in collaboration with Project
3 by making a mouse line, using CRISPR-Cas9, in which the conserved mouse Ser358 in STING is mutated to
Ala. Ala358 is found in all bat species and results in dampened signaling and reduced inflammation. (3) Breed
and maintain mice for project investigators; distribute mouse specimens to the projects. We will breed Annihilator,
SIRT6-OE, STING KO, bat-STING and L1 reporter mice to MAPT and 5xFAD mouse models of AD for Projects
1 and 3. Multiple tissues including different regions of the brain will be harvested from mice of different ages for
genomic, transcriptomic, and histological analyses. (4) Establish and maintain mouse aging colonies for Projects
1 and 3. Mouse models with genetically silenced L1 elements will be bred to MAPT and 5xFAD mouse models.
Determine mouse healthspan and lifespan. (5) Treat MAPT and 5xFAD mouse models with NRTIs (FTC) for
Projects 1 and 3 and determine the effect of the treatment on mouse life/health span and cognition. (6) Examine
mouse physical and cognitive performance for Projects 1 and 3. (7) Generate transgenic mice with mutations in
genes involved in transposon surveillance identified by Project 2. Multiple tissues including different regions of
the brain will be harvested and provided to Projects 1, 2 and Core B for analysis of transposon expression and
inflammation. (8) Maintain a database of all mice to ensure efficient distribution of materials and data to project
investigators. Maintaining the centralized rodent colonies will standardize husbandry conditions, quality control
and biological samples for use across the PPG projects, improve reproducibility of results, and allow the analysis
of the same individual animals by several assays and projects, as well as minimize animal use."
10759436,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 1)
Retrotransposable elements (RTEs) comprise ~45% of the human genome. Known as ‘mobile DNA’ they can
insert into new genomic locations using a 'copy and paste' mechanism. This process, retrotransposition, can be
deleterious at multiple levels and host organisms have evolved silencing mechanisms to protect their genomes.
Until recently RTEs were thought to be largely silent in somatic cells. In the past 10 years evidence started
emerging that somatic RTE activity is more frequent than anticipated, with our group contributing important early
evidence. It is now apparent that with aging, multiple host defense mechanisms become compromised, and
repetitive sequences in general, not just active RTEs, increase their expression. In the previous funding cycle
we discovered that LINE-1 (L1) elements are upregulated in senescent cells and generate cytoplasmically local-
ized cDNA reverse transcripts. These cDNAs are perceived as invading virus by the host and trigger a Type-I
Interferon (IFN-I) response, which in turn stimulates the innate immune system. We believe this leads to a phe-
nomenon known as 'sterile inflammation' or 'inflammaging', a known hallmark of aging that has been implicated
in a variety of age-related diseases. The central nervous system (CNS) appears to be a 'privileged site' for RTE
activity, with relatively high levels of expression and ease of further upregulation. Multiple lines of evidence indi-
cate that RTE activation is associated with pathology, and has been linked with several neurodegenerative dis-
eases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We hypothesize that activation of RTEs contributes to age-related
neurodegenerative diseases by promoting neuroinflammation. However, our knowledge of RTE biology in the
CNS is very incomplete and presents a barrier to evaluating and exploiting this new framework. This project will
explore the lifecycles of L1s in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the CNS, the L1 surveillance mechanisms,
how they fail, the consequences of that failure, and ultimately, how we can fix this. We will use human iPSC
models to mechanistically explore pathways that lead to L1 activation in cells of the CNS, the sensors and down-
stream pathways that communicate the presence of L1, and the cell inflammatory, senescence and death pro-
cesses that are elicited. We will explore the subcellular lifecycles of L1 particles using high-resolution microscopy
to understand where and how their cDNAs are synthesized. We will ablate endogenous L1s as well as overex-
press L1s at will to further probe their interactions with host cells. We will extend these studies to normal aged
mice, mouse AD models, and human AD brain tissue. We will inhibit the synthesis of L1 cDNAs with nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors to evaluate beneficial effects. The outcome of the work proposed here will provide
mechanistic insights into these complex processes and address the therapeutic potential of inhibiting RTEs for
the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias, and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases."

Project 2. Mechanisms and Functional Consequences of Selective miRNA transfer via
extracellular vesicles
James G. Patton - Investigator
Summary
Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that extracellular vesicles (EVs) constitute a novel
form of cell-cell communication through the transfer of protein, RNA and lipid cargo. Project 2
will focus on selective EV miRNA transport and uptake by recipient cells. We previously
showed that EVs from KRAS mutant cells are enriched in miR-100 and miR-125b and we have
now shown in 3D culture that EVs enriched in miR-100 and miR-125b can confer cetuximab
resistance in recipient cells. However, it remains unknown how miR-100 and miR-125b (as well
as other miRNAs) are selectively targeted for secretion while other miRNAs are retained in cells.
Here, we will focus on determining whether transfer of miR-100 and miR-125b can alter the
tumor microenvironment using a novel in vivo xenograft model in zebrafish. We will also use an
adaptation of CRISPR-Display to test the hypothesis that specific RNA sequences and/or base
modifications regulate selective miRNA export. The same cell culture assay will be used to
identify RNA binding proteins (in concert with Project 1) that recognize sequence motifs or
modified bases to drive secretion of specific miRNAs which will then be extended to in vivo
effects using the zebrafish xenograft model. Lastly, our current hypothesis is that transfer of
miR-100 and miR-125b results in the activation of Wnt signaling but the full range of mRNA
targets for these miRNAs remains unknown. Thus, we will use RIP-USE to combine
immunoprecipitation of Ago2 associated miRNAs with differential expression analysis using
Unbiased Sequence Enrichment (RIP-USE) to identify all targets of miR-100 and miR-125b.
Normal cell-cell interactions and stem cell niches in the colonic crypt appear to result from the
secretion of EVs that set up opposing gradients of Wnt and EGFR signaling, our analyses will
identify potential therapeutic target genes whose expression is altered when proper cell-cell
communication is altered during colorectal cancer."
10759439,"The overall goals of this proposal are to exploit the Drosophila model system to determine the role of
retrotransposable elements (RTEs) in the progression of cellular dysfunction that occurs during aging and
disease, and to develop interventions that suppress RTE activity to extend healthy life span and delay the onset
and progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We hypothesize that increased activity of RTEs
with age leads to loss of cellular and organismal homeostasis in somatic cells promoting aging. This in turn
interacts with AD-related changes in chromatin and RTE activity to accelerate neurodegeneration. We will use
the powerful molecular and genetic tools, as well as the short life span of Drosophila, to determine how aging
and human AD-related proteins affect the activity of RTEs and chromatin state in the brain and identify new and
novel genes that repress RTE activity and AD-related phenotypes in order to extend healthy life span and delay
the onset and progression of fly AD. We will examine how aging affects the activity of RTEs in specific subsets
of neurons and glia, and in turn, how this affects both normal aging processes and neurodegeneration in fly AD
models. Using the Drosophila model, we will employ mutagenesis screens to rapidly identify new genes and
physiological pathways controlling RTE activity and use these genetic interventions to perform detailed
phenotypic analyses over the entire life span of the organism, something that would not be possible in humans,
and would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to do in mammalian models on any large scale.
The aims of this proposal are to test the hypotheses that aging and AD interact to (i) increase RTE activity and
(ii) alter chromatin and the epigenome in selective cells in the adult fly brain; and (iii) use forward genetic screens
in Drosophila to isolate new suppressors of RTE activity that extend healthy life span and delay the onset and
progression of neurodegeneration in fly AD models.
To do this we will use new methods to examine in Aim 1 how age and AD change RTE expression and
mobilization in specific subsets of neurons and glia in the adult fly brain with scRNA-seq and RTE mobilization
reporters (in collaboration with Core B and Project 4), in Aim 2 determine how age and AD change the chromatin
state and epigenome related to RTEs with sc-ATAC-seq and CUT&RUN (in collaboration with Core B and Project
4), and in Aim 3 use a novel forward genetic screen to identify new genes and physiological pathways that
suppress RTE activity in adult fly brains, resulting in extension of life span and delaying the onset and progression
of fly AD. In collaboration with Projects 1, 3, and 4 and Core C the mammalian and human homologs of these
genes and physiological pathways that suppress fly AD will be tested for their ability to delay the onset and
progression of neurodegeneration in mouse AD models and AD-related cellular phenotypes in human neurons
and glia in tissue culture."
10759442,"Project 3 Summary (Coffey)
The Coffey lab has identified important links between WNT and EGFR signaling in cetuximab (CTX) resistance
and intestinal crypt homeostasis. We recently reported a new mode of CTX resistance due to increased WNT
signaling mediated by miR-100/-125b. These two miRs are upregulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released
by CTX-resistant cells and these EVs can transfer CTX resistance. In a unique EGFR and WNT reporter mouse
model, we show that activation of WNT signaling in an EGFR-sensitized background dramatically increases both
EGFR and non-cell autonomous WNT activity. Based on these findings, we propose a model of opposing
gradients of EGFR and WNT activity in the colonic stem cell niche (SCN) that contribute to homeostasis and
disruption of the gradient is a feature of neoplastic transformation. We hypothesize that in the normal crypt niche
EVs and exomeres released by the EGFR-active and WNT-active compartments reinforce the EGFR-WNT
gradient and in CRC these nanoparticles serve to drive tumor growth and define cancer progression due to their
oncogenically altered constituents. The model also provides a framework to further examine the role of EVs and
exomeres in conferring CTX resistance, at least in part, via increased WNT signaling. To examine this model
and to determine how EVs participate in CTX resistance, with the ultimate goal of devising strategies to overcome
CTX resistance, we propose three Aims. Aim 1 is to determine the effect of EVs and exomeres isolated from
highly informative paired cell lines on EGFR and WNT activity in reporter cell lines. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis
that these EVs and exomeres regulate normal stem cell patterning and tumor progression using our unique
EGFR and WNT reporter mouse models and their derived organoids. Aim 3 is to elucidate mechanistic
underpinnings of EV participation in resistance to EGFR blockade. This work has the potential to alter our
fundamental understanding of normal stem cell function, regulation of tumor growth and processes regulating
drug resistance."
10759443,"Retrotransposable elements (RTEs) make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes. They are repressed in
young tissues but become reactivated during aging. The only family of RTEs capable of retrotransposition in the
human genome is LINE-1 (L1). L1s can inflict damage by generating mutations and illegitimate recombination
events. During the current funding cycle we, together with other PPG members, discovered another mechanism
by which L1s cause pathology – by inducing inflammation. L1 transcriptional activation leads to accumulation of
cDNA copies in the cytoplasm, where they activate cGAS-STING signaling, ultimately driving a type I interferon
(IFN-I) response. Thus, L1s act like enemies within that awaken during aging and drive age-related pathologies.
Remarkably, ‘sterile inflammation’ has emerged as a driver of multiple age-related pathologies, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. The brain has long been considered a
‘privileged’ site for L1 activation. Levels of SIRT6 protein, one of whose functions it to repress L1 elements, are
lower in the brain of AD patients, further strengthening the link between L1 activation and AD pathology. In the
next funding cycle, we propose to test the hypothesis that silencing of L1 by genetic or pharmacological
approaches will alleviate age-related pathologies including AD. The collaborations among Projects and Cores in
this PPG will allow us to comprehensively examine the role of L1 in AD pathogenesis using our mouse models
as well as human neurons and astrocytes (Projects 1, 4). We will use three strategies to inactivate L1s: silencing
with shRNA, overexpression of SIRT6, and pharmacological inhibition with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. We generated two new mouse models: Annihilator mice in which L1 expression can be downregulated
by chained shRNAs, and SIRT6 overexpressing mice (SIRT6-OE). Both constructs are floxed and integrated in
the ROSA26 locus. Another approach will be to downregulate downstream inflammatory signaling by inhibiting
STING. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Test the effects of genetic or pharmacological L1 inhibition on AD pathology
in mouse models. In collaboration with Core C we will cross Annihilator and SIRT6-OE mice to MAPT and 5xFAD
models of neurodegeneration. We will also treat MAPT and 5xFAD mice with the NRTI FTC and analyze the
effect on lifespan and pathology with Project 1 and Cores B and C. (2) Determine the mechanisms responsible
for the formation of cytoplasmic L1 cDNAs in brain tissue (in collaboration with Projects 1 and 4, which will work
with human astrocytes and neurons, and Core B, who will provide technical resources). We will sequence the
cytoplasmic L1 DNA from brain tissue, determine the mechanisms of its priming, intracellular localization, and
identify binding proteins using mass spectrometry. (3) Determine the effects of STING inhibition on AD
pathogenesis. We will breed STING knockout mice and mice with dampened STING activity to MAPT and 5xFAD
models of neurodegeneration, with Core C. These proposed studies will address the underlying causes of
multiple age-related pathologies and will open paths for novel clinical interventions in Alzheimer’s disease."
10759446,"Project Summary:
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that is of increasing importance
to an aging global population. Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective treatments for AD,
and the molecular causes for sporadic forms of AD remain elusive. AD pathologies are intimately tied to the
aging brain; and understanding sources of age-related dysfunction in brain cell types are key for developing
therapeutic interventions. Increasingly, retrotransposable elements (RTEs), including the active human RTE
LINE1 (L1), are conspicuously linked to aging dysfunctions that closely resemble changes seen in AD, including
increased sterile inflammation, epigenetic instability and ultimately neurotoxicity. This presents the enticing
opportunity of pursuing L1 as a druggable target to halt runaway neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in
AD. To this end, this proposal utilizes a trifecta of state-of-the-art human in vitro modeling systems, including
aged induced neurons (iNs), induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived astrocytes, and glial enriched
organoids to investigate the aging- and cell type-dependent consequences of L1 activation in disease relevant
cell types.
 Using a cohort of AD patients and healthy age-matched controls derived neurons, the Gage team will
test the contribution of L1 activity to two sporadic AD pathologies: neuronal senescence, and global relaxation
of chromatin. Next, the team will directly test the necessity of L1 activation for the novel finding of spontaneous
neuroinflammation in aged AD neuronal cultures. Finally, to avoid a narrow neuron-centric model of AD, we will
extend our analyses to include patient-derived astrocytes and glial-enriched brain organoids to understand the
consequences of L1 induced inflammation in other cell types of the brain and in 3D tissue specific contexts.
 This proposal provides ample opportunity for close collaborations with other participating project
members. Patient cell lines and derived neural cells can be readily provided to collaborators for targeted analyses
on a consistent set of clinically verified human samples. Sequencing and genetic analyses are paired with
collaborating strategies in both mouse and fly models of AD, providing a platform for verification of results and
future mechanistic research. The Gage team’s strategy involves L1 targeting vectors designed by collaborating
cores to ensure reliable interventions and readouts across model systems. This project, in tandem with the efforts
of collaborators, will provide the most thorough examination of consequences of L1 activation on the AD brain
to date, potentially pioneering new therapeutic strategies for this disease of immense concern."
10766846,"Project Summary
Insufficient knowledge and throughput to interpret pathogenicity of genetic variants identified by next
generation sequencing (NGS) is a major bottleneck for genomic medicine implementation. The American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines
identify high-confidence pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants but are limited in scalability. Many variants
are classified as variants of uncertain significance by the ACMG/AMP guidelines without an indication of which
of these variants are more or less likely to be pathogenic, leading to inappropriate medical treatment. Hence, I
propose to develop standardized quantitative approaches to improve our ability to interpret genomic variations
accurately at high-throughput. In-silico tools are commonly used to assign variant pathogenicity based on
conservation, but their predictive accuracy is limited. The current methods have not been calibrated across
genes, and the same pathogenicity score does not infer the same likelihood of pathogenicity across different
genes. In this proposal, 1) I aim to recalibrate the pathogenicity scores incorporating gene-specific features
making the pathogenicity scores more comparable across genes, and improve the accuracy of pathogenicity
predictions using advanced deep neural network models and functional data from saturation mutagenesis
studies. 2) I aim to quantify the ACMG/AMP variant classification and provide probability of variant
pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes using advanced supervised learning and leveraging a large case-
control cohort. The improved computational predictions (Aim 1) will refine variant prioritization for downstream
analyses and strengthen the computational evidence used in the ACMG/AMP guidelines. The estimated
probability of variant pathogenicity based on ACMG/AMP guideline (Aim 2) will improve communication
between laboratories, health care providers and patients about genetic test results."
10884873,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The goal of this proposal is to leverage molecular neuroscience techniques to define the role of oxygen (O2)
as a biologically relevant chemosensory cue in the human-infective threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis.
Globally, S. stercoralis infects ~610 million people, with a high disease burden in resource-poor settings.
Strongyloidiasis, considered an emerging and/or re-emerging disease, can manifest as an indolent multi-decade
gastrointestinal infection; immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of hyperinfection syndrome and
disseminated disease – of which most cases are fatal. Given the threat of anthelmintic resistance, novel
chemotherapeutic strategies are needed to treat and cure individuals with strongyloidiasis.
 Parasitic nematodes rely upon neuronally detected sensory cues to actively seek hosts, navigate intra- and
extra-host environments, and coordinate their development with their local context. S. stercoralis, as a soil-
transmitted helminth, thrives in O2 concentrations that range from atmospheric levels (~21%) at the soil surface
to near-anaerobic conditions in the host intestinal tract. However, O2 sensation remains completely unstudied in
S. stercoralis or any other parasitic nematode. This proposal hypothesizes that the neural and molecular
machinery mediating O2 sensation in S. stercoralis may yield promising targets vulnerable to intervention.
 This proposal will explore O2 sensation in S. stercoralis at the behavioral, neuronal, and molecular levels. The
first aim of this proposal seeks to characterize how O2 serves as a chemosensory cue to sculpt the motile
behaviors of S. stercoralis throughout its parasitic life cycle. Quantitative analysis of parasite behaviors in
different O2 contexts will be performed. Additionally, work proposed in the first aim will interrogate the role of
shifting O2 levels as a developmental cue that enables parasitism. In the second aim of this proposal,
chemogenetic neuronal silencing and calcium imaging techniques will be employed to both identify O2-sensing
neurons and describe parasite-specific encoding properties in these neurons. In the proposal’s third aim,
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and ectopic expression systems will be used to determine the molecular
sensors of O2 in S. stercoralis and explore their mechanism of action. This proposal will generate new insights
into parasite chemosensory neurobiology and may reveal novel strategies for preventing nematode infections.
 This proposal will support the applicant’s goal of becoming a physician-scientist dedicated to the study and
clinical management of parasitic infectious diseases. In completing the proposed aims, the applicant will augment
prior training in parasitology and molecular biology with the development of new skills in neuroscience research.
This work will be performed in one of the only laboratories studying neurobiology in parasitic nematodes; the
applicant will also seek mentorship from the rich community of parasitologists and neuroscientists at UCLA."
10750847,"TBI is a major population health concern in U.S. service members and Veterans. Research has shown that
Veterans who sustain the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI, or concussion), often report varied and
lasting neurobehavioral complaints and functional impairments, placing them at-risk for long-term disability.
Other factors, such as distress brought about by co-occurring mental health conditions and chronic pain, are
thought to contribute to these negative outcomes, and recent studies have shown that mental health
intervention can improve neurobehavioral functioning in these Veterans. However, barriers to accessing
effective mental health care are evident. For instance, many mental health treatments require a high time and
resource investment for both patients and providers, and many mTBI-focused treatments are only accessible in
specialty treatment environments. Further, interventions capable of addressing the variety of neurobehavioral
complaints cited in this clinical cohort are lacking. To address these gaps in care, our team recently adapted
Problem-Solving Training for Concussion (PST-Concussion), a brief, primary care-based cognitive-behavioral
intervention designed to improve recovery from mTBI. PST-Concussion was specifically adapted for use in the
primary care setting given its practical advantages for easy access to care, and the emphasis on primary care
management present in current mTBI clinical practice guidelines. While our preliminary work established that
PST-Concussion is acceptable and feasible, a more comprehensive evaluation is needed to determine
whether it is clinically effective. To this end, the proposed study will be a longitudinal randomized two-arm
parallel group clinical trial. One hundred thirty-four participants will be randomized 1:1 to either PST-
Concussion or treatment as usual (TAU). Eligible participants will be Veterans ages 18 and older who are
enrolled in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care and evidence: a) history of mTBI; b) current
psychological distress; and c) persistent neurobehavioral symptoms of ≥ 3 months. Participants assigned to
PST-Concussion will receive six, approximately 30-minute telehealth treatment sessions. Sessions include
standard concussion education, motivational interviewing and goal-setting, compensatory cognitive strategies,
relaxation training, and training in planful problem-solving. Assessments will include standard self-report and
cognitive measures that will be administered at baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. The
primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of PST-Concussion in reducing
psychological distress compared to TAU. Secondary and tertiary objectives will be to evaluate whether PST-
Concussion is associated with appreciable change in subjective neurocognitive functioning, objective
neurocognitive functioning, psychosocial functioning, and disability and quality of life. Multi-level modeling will
be used to evaluate treatment effects at post-treatment and three-month follow-up. A test of non-inferiority will
be conducted to evaluate the potential durability of observed treatment effects from post-test to follow-up. A
portion of participants assigned to PST-Concussion will also be interviewed at post-treatment or follow-up to
gain insight into the practical impact of intervention on psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Potential
benefits of participation in this telehealth treatment include opportunities to reduce psychological distress and
improve neurobehavioral functioning."
10866566,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a permanent, localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta with
the potentially fatal consequence of aortic rupture. The only effective treatment for AAA is open or
endovascular surgical repair when AAA patients with symptomatic or large AAA. The vast majority of AAA are
below the threshold for surgical repair and 50-70% of small AAAs eventually progress to a stage requiring
surgical repair. Currently, there is no effective medical therapy for these patients to reduce aneurysm growth
and reduce the risk of rupture, highlighting an urgent need to develop effective medical treatments to prevent
aneurysm growth and reduce the risk of rupture. Chronic inflammation and vascular smooth muscle (VSMC)
dysfunction have been well documented in AAA pathogenesis in both AAA patients and animal models. Our
study and others have shown that macrophage infiltration and VSMC dysfunction can be noted at a very early
stage of AAA induction. Inhibition of inflammatory activation effectively reduces development and progression
of AAA in animal models. However, several clinical trials have reported no efficacy of several drugs with anti-
inflammatory properties to limit AAA progression, indicating a need of new strategies by targeting AAA lesions
and suppressing inflammatory responses and preserving VSMC function to prevent and treat AAA. We have
been developing nanoparticles (NP) to treat cardiovascular disease since 2014, in which small size NP and/or
encapsulated with active therapeutic agents can be precisely applied to the target sites, such as
atherosclerotic plaques and AAA lesions. Recently, we generated a novel phospholipid NP (PLN), miNano
(Michigan Nanoparticle), which could accumulate in AAA lesions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that
Krüppel-like factor 14 (KLF14) has strong anti-inflammatory effects by directly suppressing the nuclear factor-
κB p65 expression. Recently, we found that KLF14 play an important role in maintaining VSMC function. Our
preliminary studies found that nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2), a compound currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, could
induce KLF14 expression and shows VSMC protective effects in a KLF14-dependent manner. Administration
of OA-NO2 protects against AAA formation and progression in mouse model. Based on these findings, we
propose the central hypothesis that PLN-mediated delivery OA-NO2, a KLF14 inducer, protects against AAA
pathogenesis by maintaining VSMC function and inhibiting vascular inflammation. Aim 1. Define that OA-NO2-
KLF14 is a protective pathway in AAA pathogenesis. Aim 2. Develop PLN as an efficient AAA drug delivery
system. Aim 3. Determine the ability of PLN-OA-NO2 to reduce AAA dissection and rupture in vivo. This study
will promote the development of novel pharmacological therapies for AAA by PLN-mediated targeted drug
delivery for highly efficient, more feasible and less side effects."
10995261,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) and associated opioid overdoses are public health crises of increasing severity,
reflected by a staggering 80,000 opioid overdose associated deaths in the United States alone in 2021. Despite
the availability of current treatment strategies including medications for opioid use disorder and medication
assisted treatment (MOUD and MAT), opioid overdoses continue to skyrocket at an alarming rate. Recently,
vaccines targeting opioids were proposed as a novel intervention to combat the growing crisis. Vaccines
targeting opioids have been developed using traditional protein carrier approaches and are entering human
clinical trials. The overall goal of this fellowship is to investigate the efficacy of a Qβ bacteriophage virus-like
particle (VLP) based vaccine targeting oxycodone as a novel treatment to prevent oxycodone overdose.
Bacteriophage VLPs are highly immunogenic vaccine platforms that are well-established to be safe and effective
in humans. This project will be conducted under the central hypothesis that a Qβ VLP conjugated vaccine
targeting oxycodone will offer protection upon cognate drug challenge with limited cross-reactivity. This
hypothesis will be investigated by the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of
immunization on drug distribution across the blood-brain barrier. Using high-performance liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), drug concentrations will be determined in the blood and brain compartments of
immunized animals. Specific Aim 2: Investigate protection elicited by Qβ-oxycodone upon intravenous drug
challenge. Utilizing whole-body plethysmography (WBP), I will investigate Qβ-oxycodone mediated protection
from opioid induced respiratory depression upon intravenous drug challenge. Specific Aim 3: Examine the impact
of immunization on naloxone efficacy. Using in-vitro and in-vivo approaches, the cross-reactivity of vaccine
elicited antibodies with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone will be determined. Together, these aims are
focused on the long-term goal to inform effective vaccine design and offer new treatment options for OUD
patients."
10839797,"Project Summary/Abstract
Animals combine sensory information and prior experiences to select and adapt behavior. How the brain
supports this ability is unknown, and this question is advantageously addressed through investigations of mouse
social behavior. In mice, social behaviors are strongly coupled to the detection of well-defined chemosignals
(e.g., pheromones), are stereotypical across individuals, and are robustly modulated by an animal’s history.
These features provide an excellent framework to define behaviorally-relevant brain areas and investigate the
underlying neural mechanisms of sensory-guided, flexible behavior. Indeed, previous studies implicate the
accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) in regulating social behaviors, but technical limitations have precluded the ability
to record activity during naturalistic interactions among freely-moving conspecific partners. Thus, our
understanding of how social behavior shapes ongoing neural activity and how this activity, in turn, guides social
behavior during active behavior remains limited. This proposal incorporates several innovative experimental
strategies and technological advances to deepen our understanding of the neural dynamics and network
architectures that support social behavior. Specifically, I will first use head-mounted miniature microscopes
(“miniscopes”) to determine how social information is represented within the AOB of freely-moving mice during
prolonged interactions as animals actively engage with a range of conspecific partners and with unique
chemosignals. Next, I propose to establish the relationship between AOB activity and intermale aggression. First,
through targeted ex vivo recordings and bidirectional chemogenetic manipulations, I will establish the relationship
between functionally defined AOB neurons and aggression levels. Next, I will determine how AOB sensory
responses are affected by mating; a salient life event that promotes AOB plasticity and increases aggression in
male mice. Together, I will establish how neural activity within the AOB adapts in support of flexible behavior.
Finally, I propose to define how social information is distributed to downstream, behaviorally-relevant limbic area
targets. I will perform multi-site retrograde labeling and pathway-specific manipulations to define how the AOB
innervates downstream targets and the behavioral relevance of these pathways. Together, these experiments
will provide fundamental information of how the brain represents, modifies, and distributes social information in
support of flexible behavior. Moreover, these results will further establish the AOB and related structures as a
powerful framework to explore the neural underpinnings of complex behavior."

Precision nutrition approaches aim to move away from a one-size fits all approach to identify individual-level
dietary and nutritional intake for optimal health by accounting for individual variability in genes, phenotype,
environment, and lifestyle for each person (NIH) – i.e., tailoring nutrition interventions and/or recommendations
to individuals by accounting for the complex nutritional ecology reflecting the interaction of a complex system.
The components of precision nutrition include assessments of a number of biological, clinical, social, and
environmental parameters including the multi-omics, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, as well as
account for sustainability. Approaches relying on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are
increasingly being used across the research realm including in nutrition to analyze and interpret such complex
data. The 2020-30 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research, developed by the NIH Nutrition Research Task
Force, identifies a key need to produce a nutrition workforce that is trained to solve the most pressing problems
in nutrition and health, by applying novel methods and working in multidisciplinary teams. We propose to
leverage our existing strengths and initiatives at Cornell to implement a novel program to train the next
generation of scientists in the domains of AI and precision nutrition to address the future needs for the nutrition
workforce. The training program, with positions for 4 predoctoral and 1 postdoctoral trainees per year, is built
on the outstanding doctoral programs in the multiple departments at Cornell University participating in this
application, which emphasize multidisciplinary and integrative scholarship across the biological, physical,
behavioral, data, and social sciences. The 23 trainers represent the broad range of disciplines necessary to
achieve the goals of the training program and include renowned scientists with expertise spanning from
nutrition, medicine, health, computing and information sciences, bioinformatics, population genetics, and
computational biology. The trainers have active research programs and excellent training records. The
proposed training program includes a core curriculum tailored for students starting in nutrition and minoring in
computer science and for those starting in computer sciences and minoring in nutrition. We have also included
plans for a new AI and Precision Nutrition course with hands on analyses that is already being put in place and
will be ready for roll out in the next academic year. The infrastructure to support the proposed training program
is outstanding, with added strengths from faculty members across the campus. Further, the new AI innovation
hub at the Cornell Center for Precision Nutrition and Health will provide a unique opportunity for diverse
trainees to come together and prepare the next generation of the nutrition scientific workforce."
10996096,"Blood disease, including anemia, blood clotting, and blood cancers, affects millions of people worldwide each
year, causing tremendous economic and social burdens. The American Cancer Society estimated 178,520 blood
cancer cases in 2020 in America and approximately 5,600 patients died of anemia in 2019 in the US. Our country
faces at least a 45 billion dollars economic burden annually due to blood related diseases. However, the current
treatments of blood-related diseases only palliate the symptom and temporarily prevent the disease progression.
The goal of this project is to investigate the roles played by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived
from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) during vertebrate hematopoiesis
and evaluate in vivo their therapeutic potentials for blood disorders. I performed chemical screen in zebrafish
embryos using several ecosanoid derived SPMs and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) to identify
compounds that are able to increase Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and red blood cell (RBC). This screen
identified two promising SMP compound hits: 7,17 dihydroxy DPA (7,17 diHDPAn-3) and 19,20 epoxy DPA
(19,20 EpDPA). In this proposal I will evaluate their effects on the proliferation of downstream hematopoietic
lineages, including myeloid and lymphoid lineages by exposing wild-type zebrafish embryos to 1.5 µM 7,17
diHDPAn-3 and 2.5 µM 19,20 EpDPA from 11-36 hours post fertilization (hpf). After fixation, I will perform WISH
and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using c-myb, gata1, l-plastin, lyz, mpeg, rag1 and CD79 mRNA
probes and primers to descriptively and quantitatively evaluate the resulting effects of the two SPMs exposure
on the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor erythroid, granulocytic cells, neutrophils, and
macrophages, T and B cells respectively. Our preliminary data show that both 7,17 diHDPAn-3 and 19,20 EpDPA
promote HSC proliferation, increase RBC progenitors and RBC number, and increase neutrophil cell number.
Therefore, I hypothesize that 7,17 diHDPAn-3 and 19,20 EpDPA exposure enhances HSC proliferation,
increasing downstream mature blood cell types in vertebrates. To test our central hypothesis, I developed
the following two specific aims: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that the two selected SPMs increase HSC number,
leading to increases in myeloid-derived cell and lymphoid-derived cell numbers and Aim 2. To test the hypothesis
that the two selected SPMs can be used as therapeutic interventions in disease models such as bacteria-
mediated infection, hematopoiesis genetic diseases, and post-irradiated adult zebrafish. This work will
characterize the roles of these two SPMs during vertebrate hematopoiesis and will test their therapeutic potential
in vivo. The outcome of this proposal will discover an unknown role for these two SPMs in regulating
hematopoiesis, opening a new road to developing a novel therapeutic therapy for blood-related diseases."

The Program entitled “Genetic Variation in Cancer Risk and Outcomes in African Americans” comprises three
Research Projects and two Shared Resource Core components (Administration, and Data Collection and Clinical
Genetics). The Data Collection and Clinical Genetics Core provides a shared platform for the identification of
eligible Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) study participants for all Projects, provides existing ROCS
data for all projects, supports large scale recruitment and data collection for Project 2 using the ROCS framework,
collects new and manages existing biospecimens for sequencing and genotyping including quality control on
returned genetic data, and links patient data to the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS)
cancer registry for clinical cancer data, the occurrence of multiple primary cancers and recurrence/survival
outcomes. The Core will ensure consistency in the use of previously collected data and biospecimens and
reliability in incorporating/linking these data with newly collected, Project-specific survey and genetic data and
biospecimens across the three projects and four participating institutions. The Core will also provide access to
clinical genetics testing services for those participants who, based on research-based testing, carry clinically
actionable mutations or are included in Project 3. With these resources, we have the opportunity to address
genetic variation in a population-based study of African Americans with cancer and improve uptake of genetic
testing that will ultimately lead to improved outcomes and a reduction in cancer disparities."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) leverages funding from the CCSG and
Institutional/Philanthropic support to: 1) offer an array of pilot project opportunities spanning basic, clinical,
translational, and population science research topics important to achieving the goals of our Strategic Plan
and in alignment with catchment area priorities; and 2) provide New Investigator Awards (NIAs) to cancer-
focused research faculty new to Rutgers (RU) and Princeton (PU) Universities and cancer-related research
faculty established at Rutgers and Princeton Universities. The ultimate goals are to increase cancer focus,
integrate the five Research Programs, and increase collaboration with Center Members (these awards are
not synonymous and are in addition to faculty recruitment start-up funds).
In an effort to accelerate our progress toward meeting Strategic Plan goals, CINJ leveraged its status as the
only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in New Jersey to garner additional institutional
commitment, supplemented by generous philanthropic and State support, to establish four new Centers of
Excellence (Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorder Research, Immunology/Metabolism, Cancer Survivorship,
and Outcomes, and Cancer Health Equity) with annual budgets containing funding for pilot awards.
Establishment of the Princeton Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research created additional
opportunities to engage PU members in immunology and metabolism research.
CINJ’s process for Developmental Funds administration has been enhanced (more frequent and detailed
reporting) and made more efficient over this grant period by utilizing two new decision support tools: the
InfoReady platform, a shared investment with Rutgers University, for automated award review and reporting,
and EVAL as the data warehouse for Developmental Funds awards and demonstrable outcomes.
CINJ’s oversight of Developmental Funds resulted in strong ROI from its Pilot Project and New Investigator
Awards in the form of publications, extramural funding (peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed), clinical trials,
training activities, community outreach activities, bidirectional communication with the community, policy-
related activities, and commercialization activities. In this grant period, 28 pilot projects were awarded and
completed (resulting in nine peer-reviewed, extramural awards), and an additional 19 pilot projects received
funding in the last 12 months. Philanthropic funds were leveraged for a pilot award to Eileen White allowing
for the generation of preliminary data resulting in a successful CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge application.
Twelve New Investigator Awards over this grant period resulted in eight peer-reviewed, extramural awards.
In addition, after research leadership endorsed Dr. Zhiyuan Shen to develop a P01 application, Libutti worked
with the Rutgers University Foundation to secure $2M in seed funding which enabled the generation of
preliminary data resulting in a successful P01 application (not a formal Pilot Project as defined herein)."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Shared Resource Management (SRM) is the administrative management unit for eight Shared Resources (SRs)
that offer scientific services to CINJ members throughout the Rutgers University/Princeton University consortium.
The mission of SRM is to support the scientific development, administrative governance, and financial
accountability of CINJ’s SRs. We fulfill our mission by promoting cost-effective services that support the five
Research Programs, align with CINJ’s strategic plan, and support member needs. Our SRs offer cutting edge
instrumentation, centralized intellectual and technical resources, and advanced technical support that drive
innovative cancer research. SRM is led by the Associate Director for Shared Resources (ADSR), Adam Berger,
MD, who is supported by Ioannis Stasinopoulos, PhD, Assistant Director for SRs. Under their leadership CINJ
re-configured each of the eight SR advisory committees (SRACs) to function as the primary venue of internal
planning and evaluation for the respective SRs; emphasized satisfaction surveys with tracking of action items
and discussion of satisfaction survey comments in each annual SRAC meeting; deployed scientific service
development surveys that are discussed with the respective SRAC and CINJ’s Research Leadership Council
(RLC); improved chargeback collection and communicated chargeback expectations to SRs; implemented iLab
Solutions billing and scheduling; and employed a publication tracking process. SRM reports on SR scientific
achievements and opportunities and on member feedback to the RLC as needed. SRM reviews finances,
staffing, and business planning with the AD for Administration and Planning quarterly and as needed. Informed
by the scientific recommendations made by the RLC and the financial planning by the AD for Administration and
Planning, the ADSR recommends actions to the Center Director who maintains authority over all SR
management decisions. SRM supports the CINJ mission with the following specific aims: 1) Provide centralized
cutting-edge scientific services, technologies, consultation, and expertise to meet strategic plan objectives and
member needs; 2) Provide operational oversight, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, business planning, and
customer satisfaction and feedback that expand scientific excellence, and 3) Promote training and outreach
activities that expand the member base and strengthen productivity and collaboration at CINJ. In order to
continue to effectively support these aims and the CINJ Strategic Plan for growth and expansion of services,
SRM will hire a programmer and data analyst to automate the distribution of satisfaction surveys following the
completion of each experiment and fully automate utilization capture and analysis. SRM will support SR
modernization initiatives across the translational continuum by supporting the developing Organoid Development

10767830,"The hippocampal-prefrontal circuit is implicated in many neuropsychiatric illnesses. This circuit is critically
involved in multiple aspects of cognition and emotional regulation, and is particularly vulnerable to stress, which
is a key precipitating factor for many of these disorders. Chronic stress can have deleterious effects on neuronal
structure and physiological function in the hippocampus, and impair hippocampal-dependent behavior, including
processing of contextual fear memories. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex communicate during cognitive
and emotional tasks by altering the coherence of oscillatory activity between the two regions. However, the
cellular and molecular events that drive these changes in hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony, and how they are
influenced by stress, are not well understood. Understanding the mechanisms by which exposure to stress leads
to disruptions in hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during fear regulation is a high priority given that altered
fear-related behavior is prominent in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Our preliminary data support the
hypothesis that exposure to stress impacts plasticity in the hippocampal-prefrontal pathway, leading to disrupted
connectivity between the two regions and enhanced fear-related behavior. Many of the risk factors for
neuropsychiatric disorders, including stress, affect genes that play important roles in the development and
plasticity of synapses. Hence, disruptions in synaptic connections of the long-range projections between the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex could contribute to impairments in hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony.
However, there is a dearth of research aimed at understanding molecular signaling pathways in these projection
cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defined programs of cellular and molecular signaling in
hippocampal-prefrontal projection neurons control their structure and function, and that these signaling pathways
regulate patterns of neural activity and connectivity between the two structures. The overall goals of this
application are to 1) understand how stress drives molecular and cellular signaling in hippocampal-prefrontal
projection cells to control their physiological function; and 2) determine how plasticity in hippocampal-prefrontal
projections neurons impacts functional connectivity in this circuit to control fear-related behavior. We use a
technically sophisticated combination of neuronal morphology analysis with endoscopic imaging and in vivo
electrophysiology to understand how stress impacts cellular plasticity in hippocampal-prefrontal projection
neurons. We then determine how these cellular correlates of plasticity impact hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony
during fear-related behavior. In addition to cellular correlates, we combine molecular profiling techniques with
retrograde viral approaches to investigate molecular contributions to plasticity in hippocampal-prefrontal
neurons. The research will reveal fundamental information about molecular and cellular signaling programs in
hippocampal-prefrontal projection neurons that contribute to functional connectivity, information that will be
critical for future strategies targeting this pathway."
10784132,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adult survivors of childhood cancer face a lifetime of health risks due to past cancer treatments, with an estimated
80% experiencing at least one severe or life-threatening chronic health condition by age 45. To receive the
recommended lifelong survivorship care, young adult childhood cancer survivors (YA-CCS) need to develop
skills to manage their own care as they age. Triadic communication among YA-CCS, parents/caregivers, and
clinicians is essential for YA-CCS to learn about their cancer history and develop these skills; however,
communicating about survivorship topics is complex and even more challenging for families who prefer a
language other than English. Language barriers and other social determinants of health (income, education,
race/ethnicity) contribute to health disparities among childhood cancer survivors, yet very few interventions have
addressed these disparities. Bilingual community health workers help connect underserved communities with
services such as cancer screening but have not been widely employed in cancer survivorship settings. New
strategies are critically needed to reduce communication barriers and improve survivorship care among YA-CCS
at risk for health disparities. To address these gaps, the applicant Dr. Smith will leverage her partnership with a
community organization serving predominantly Hispanic/Latino (Latinx) families of children with cancer in a
region in California with low socioeconomic status and high rates of non-English language preference. The
proposed study will develop, pilot test, and refine a culturally and linguistically tailored family-centered
communication intervention for Latinx YA-CCS and parents/caregivers. Specifically, the study aims to 1)
Evaluate survivorship-related communication gaps and linguistic and cultural communication preferences among
Latinx YA-CCS and parents through English and Spanish focus groups; 2) Develop a community health worker-
led intervention to facilitate communication among YA-CCS, parents, and clinicians, applying principles of
community-based participatory research to involve cancer survivors, parents, and community members in an
iterative intervention design process; and 3) Pilot test the communication intervention to evaluate feasibility and
acceptability among 18 YA-CCS–parent dyads and refine the intervention based on feedback. Through leading
this study, Dr. Smith will develop advanced skills in community-engaged research, family-centered
communication, and intervention science. She will do so through structured training with support from a strong
mentorship team with expertise in community-based participatory research, communication, behavioral
interventions, and cancer survivorship. Dr. Smith’s mentorship and training plan, combined with Stanford’s robust
institutional support for community-engaged research, are anticipated to launch Dr. Smith’s independent career
leading patient-centered, community-engaged clinical research studies to reduce health disparities among
childhood cancer survivors. This research fills an important gap by involving a novel population that is vulnerable
to health disparities (Latinx YA-CCS) and addressing a novel intervention target (triadic communication)."
10772050,"Project Summary – Core C CRISPR-IMAGE
CRISPR technologies are revolutionizing and accelerating discovery in bioscience. They enable efficient
editing, insertion and deactivation of genes in mammalian cells. Likewise, high-resolution and high-throughput
optical imaging enables rapid analysis of cellular and molecular phenotypes. This core will leverage our recent
advances in CRISPR and optical imaging capabilities along with our extensive experience in fluorescent
protein molecular biology, to create a powerful new resource, embodied within the CRISPR-IMAGE Core.
Here, we propose to unite existing resources with new ones to provide the needed capabilities for this COBRE
(BioSNTR-II). The CRISPR-IMAGE Core will enable cutting-edge genotype-to-phenotype analysis within the
research projects of BioSNTR-II. Specifically, this core will enable creation of the targeted gene knockouts in
cell lines and primary cells proposed in all three of the research projects. The CRISPR-IMAGE Core has three
specific aims: 1) CRISPR-mediated gene disruption and fluorescent protein chimera expression in immune and
inflammatory cells; 2) High-resolution imaging of cellular structures in normal or CRISPR-edited cells; and 3)
High-content microscopy, flow cytometric analysis, and whole-genome CRISPR screening of cellular functions
in gene-edited cells. This core is particularly significant because it brings leading-edge molecular biology and
microscopy technologies to the research projects to help them make potent impacts in biomedical research
and to compete in the national and international funding arenas. This core is highly innovative in that it directly
combines CRISPR gene-editing with optical microscopy methods thereby linking genome-to-phenome
approaches into a compressive workflow."
10772109,"Cardiometabolic Core (Core B) Summary
The Cardiometabolic Core (Core B) will allow for the careful planning and coordination of research designs,
disease models, and data collection among the four Research Projects. The Core will be utilized for the induction,
maintenance, and analysis of cardiometabolic diseases in rats and mice. Core B will be a newly established
facility housing the equipment and personnel for standardized measures in the proposed Research Projects.
The specific functions of Core B are organized into three Aims. Aim 1 will employ standardized animal diets and
specimen collection across all four projects. It will ensure that feeding, monitoring, and tissue collection are
consistent across projects and will establish a tissue bank available to Tulane and extramural researchers. Aim
2 will employ standardized metabolic measurements across all four projects to provide the same metabolic
conditions and measurements. Aim 3 will employ standardized cardiovascular measurements across all four
projects to ensure that cardiovascular disease is implemented equally in rats and mice. This coordination among
the projects will improve the scope of the research by allowing inferences between studies that could not be
made if each project introduced new variables. In addition, Core B will maintain standardized protocols and
procedures to allow comparison of data across studies and thereby will improve rigor and reproducibility."
11143565,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. OSCC is
curable with favorable survival outcomes if detected early. The majority of OSCCs are preceded by oral
potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) with oral leukoplakia or white lesions being the most common type.
However, not all oral leukoplakia progresses to OSCC. Accurate identification of OPMDs that are likely to
progress to OSCC offers the best strategy for OSCC prevention and management and can lead to decreasing
patients’ morbidity and mortality through earlier detection. Although proven inadequate, microscopic examination
and histological grading remain the gold standard for predication of malignant transformation. For instance, some
low-grade OPMDs will progress to OSCC but not all high-grade OPMDs progress to OSCC. There is an urgent
and unmet demand for highly efficacious biomarkers to identify progressive leukoplakias with a high risk of OSCC
conversion. Addressing this knowledge gap can lead to early detection of HPV-negative OSCC and improve
patient survival. Examining OPMDs with and without malignant transformation, we have found specific
transcriptomic signatures which are associated with progressive OPMDs. Using spatial transcriptomics and
multiplex immune fluorescence (mIF), we observed that malignantly transformed OPMDs have significantly
increased immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (enriched in ARG1) and low levels of CD8+ T-
cells. Our central hypothesis is that the levels and trajectories of such signatures in tissues are predictive of the
malignant conversion of OPMDs to OSCC. The primary objective of this multi-disciplinary U01 collaborative
study is to identify and validate transcriptomic and immune signatures that can discriminate OPMDs predicted
to malignantly progress and develop, validate, and refine a risk stratification model based on identified
biomarkers and clinical variables. In Aims 1 and 2, we will leverage a well-characterized, racially diverse
population of over 500 individuals with histologically confirmed OPMDs. We will validate our list of transcriptomic
and immune-related biomarkers and perform RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to identify potential
additional transcripts associated with the malignant progression of OPMDs. In Aim 3, we will develop a
combination risk score formula based on selected transcriptomics and immune biomarkers and
clinicodemographic variables to predict OMPD malignant progression based on our internal cohort. We will
validate the combination risk score formula in an independent cohort of 300 patients. The risk score formula can
be used by clinicians for risk assessment and clinical decision making. The contribution from this project is
expected to be significant as it can lead to introduction of a personalized risk stratification approach for
management of OPMDs. Detecting preneoplastic lesions with high malignant transformation risk will substantially
increase patient survival while maximizing OSCC screening benefits."
10773075,"Project Summary/Abstract
Most solid organ recipients are prescribed tacrolimus to prevent rejection and maintain allograft function. The
overall goal of this study is to assess the safety of cannabidiol (CBD) when co-administered with tacrolimus.
The proposed studies will comprehensively define the pharmacokinetic interactions of cannabidiol, tacrolimus,
and CYP3A5. Cannabidiol is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes and CYP3A5 is a
polymorphic enzyme with expression differences across populations.
During the proposed experimentation, we will uncover whether the metabolism of CBD is affected by CYP3A5
genotype. We will also determine whether a drug-drug interaction (DDI) exists between cannabidiol and
tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. If a DDI is identified, we will
determine whether this DDI is more potent in CYP3A5 normal metabolizers. We hypothesize that CBD will
cause a drug-drug interaction requiring a much larger dose reduction of tacrolimus in CYP3A5 expressors than
non-expressors. In aim 1, we will test this hypothesis in a series of PK studies in individuals with different
CYP3A5 genotypes. The primary outcome is the tacrolimus area-under-the-curve (AUC) in CYP3A5
expressors and non-expressors while taking CBD at a steady state concentration.
CBD may also lead to pharmacodynamic effects relevant to transplant recipients, independent of tacrolimus
concentration. Thus, in aim 2, we investigate the pharmacodynamic interactions of CBD and tacrolimus in the
immune system. We will use sensitive phenotypes such as immune cell distribution and cell expression
signatures derived from single cell sequencing. The information gleaned in these experiments is important as it
is expected that this work will help practitioners advise their patients, including transplant recipients, whether
drug interactions are present or whether it is safe to take cannabidiol."
10779507,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women. PCOS
is diagnosed by elevated androgens, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Women with PCOS have a
high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs), such as obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and elevated
blood pressure (BP). Effective therapeutic agents to treat CRFs found in PCOS women are limited. The long-
term goal is to find effective and safe therapeutic agents to treat CRFs in PCOS women. The Renin-Angiotensin
System (RAS), with its classical and nonclassical pathways, is a regulatory system for BP control and metabolic
function. The adipose tissue has a fully functional RAS with systemic, paracrine, and autocrine actions. This
research proposal will elucidate the role that the adipose classical and nonclassical RAS plays in IR and BP
regulation in PCOS. IR is present in lean and obese PCOS women. Plasma adiponectin levels, an insulin-
sensitizing hormone, are low in PCOS women, making it an attractive molecular target to decrease IR. The goal
of this proposal is to study the interplay between androgens, adiposity, adipose classical and nonclassical RAS,
and adiponectin to mediate CRFs in PCOS women. Our central hypothesis is that “hyperandrogenemia has
obesity-dependent and -independent effects, leading to increased BP and IR in PCOS. Activation of the classical
and inactivation of the nonclassical adipose RAS lead to increased BP. Furthermore, independent of obesity,
androgens cause IR via decreased adiponectin levels in PCOS”. This novel and clinically relevant hypothesis
will be tested with these aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that obesity as a result of hyperandrogenemia
causes an activation of the RAS and increases BP in the PCOS model; Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that an
imbalance of the adipose classical and nonclassical RAS in response to hyperandrogenemia leads to increased
BP in the PCOS model; Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that decreases in adiponectin in response to
hyperandrogenemia lead to obesity-independent IR in the PCOS model. We will test this hypothesis using an
innovative combination of gold-standard methods to measure BP, IR, fat distribution and function, and
systemic and adipose RAS peptides in two well-characterized, clinically relevant models of PCOS and a 3D
adipocytes cell culture. The proposed research is significant because it will shed light on the androgens-
mediated mechanisms and the interplay between obesity, the classical and nonclassical RAS, and adipokines
in the pathophysiology of the CRFs in PCOS women. Moreover, this study will identify potential new therapeutic
options to ameliorate CRFs in PCOS women."
10783021,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is a nutrient sensor protein which is highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells. This
enzyme exclusively catalyzes the post-translational glycosylation of target cytosolic and nucleic proteins (O-
GlcNAcylation). β-cell OGT knockout mice develop severe diabetic phenotype, suggesting that OGT is crucial in
shaping glucose homeostasis. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms of how
protein O-GlcNAcylation shape β-cell health and function. Our data suggest a strong relationship between OGT
and mechanistic target of Rapamycin complex 1, mTORC1, a key nutrient-sensor kinase in β-cells. While
aberrant autophagy and chronic mTORC1 activation is observed in islets from human diabetic patients, the
mechanisms of how these signaling pathways become dysregulated is unknown. We propose that in response
to nutrient stress, protein O-GlcNAcylation directly regulates mTORC1 activity and subsequent downstream
mitochondrial function through the process of autophagy. Our central hypothesis is that in nutrient stress
conditions, decreased O-GlcNAcylation leads to insulin secretion deficits through hypo-activation of mTORC1
and hyper-activation of autophagy. The main objective of this proposal is to delineate the signaling between OGT
and mTORC1-autophagy and their contribution to β-cell health and function. Specific Aim 1 will investigate how
O-GlcNAcylation regulates mTORC1 activity and β-cell mass and function. Specific Aim 2 will test whether O-
GlcNAcylation modulates autophagy in β-cells and to determine the consequences of dysregulated autophagy
in organelle homeostasis. This F31 proposal is innovative because there are currently no studies linking OGT
and mTORC1 crosstalk in pancreatic islets and their regulation of autophagy-dependent β-cell mass and insulin
secretion. Successful completion of the proposal will reveal the mechanisms linking nutrient stress conditions
such as hyper-glycemia and -lipidemia to aberrant changes in organelle dysfunction and identify specific β-cell
nodes of regulation between OGT and mTORC1 signaling that can be targeted for therapeutics to prevent the
development of type 2 diabetes. The proposal incorporates new and timely-needed training in conceptual
knowledge in islet biology, autophagy, and mitochondria, and technical skills including perifusion based insulin
secretion assay, specialize imaging techniques (TEM, confocal, live cell), and Seahorse XF mitochondrial
respiration assay. Scientific communication in oral and written presentation, as well as mentoring leadership will
be an integral part of training to become a successful academician. All the technical resources as well as
dedicated mentors at University of Minnesota and the department of Integrative Biology and Physiology are
available to assist the trainee to successfully complete his F31 proposal and to assist him achieved his career
and academic goals."
10776213,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal aims to elucidate the molecular circuitry that limits the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR)-engineered T cells. CARs are synthetic proteins that, when expressed by T cells, can mediate potent
activity against cancer. The most successful clinical application of this technology targets CD19 on the surface
of B cell leukemia and lymphoma. While curative for some, durable remissions are seen in less than half of
patients treated. Emerging data point to CAR T cell failure, as opposed to cancer cell resistance, as the driver of
poor outcomes and disease progression. These findings highlight that understanding how CARs direct T cell
function and dysfunction is of critical importance.
 The form of T cell dysfunction that is best understood is exhaustion, a cell state that develops as a result of
chronic stimulation of the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) in the setting of chronic viral infection. All CARs
contain the primary signaling domain of the TCR as well as an additional costimulatory domain to enhance T cell
activation. Of the six CAR products approved for clinical use in the US, four contain the costimulatory domain
from 41BB while two contain the domain from CD28. To identify the CAR-activated molecular pathways
responsible for T cell failure we developed an in vitro system that induces T cell dysfunction through chronic
CAR stimulation. We observed that while 41BB and CD28-based CAR T cells both lose function as a result of
chronic stimulation, these receptors activate divergent molecular circuitry as they lose function. CD28-based
CAR T cells are phenotypically, transcriptionally and epigenetically similar to exhausted T cells. In contrast,
41BB-based CAR T cells do not bear the hallmarks of classic exhaustion but are distinct at all levels of
programming. We observed activation of this unique transcriptional signature of 41BB-driven dysfunction in CAR
T cells that failed to control disease in patients. We further identified that the transcription factor FOXO3 is highly
active in dysfunctional 41BB-based CAR T cells and that deletion of FOXO3 improves CAR T cell function.
 Based on these observations, we hypothesize that chronic stimulation of 41BB triggers signaling pathways
that aberrantly activate FOXO3 and that FOXO3 activates several distinct programs that suppress CAR T cell
function. In the proposed studies we will use biochemical techniques and high-resolution microscopy to identify
the intermediate signaling proteins that link 41BB and FOXO3 (Aim 1), use conditional expression systems to
determine how FOXO3 suppresses T cell function (Aim 2) and identify other engineered T cell therapies that are
vulnerable to 41BB-driven dysfunctional programs (Aim 3). Collectively, these studies will elucidate how chronic
activation of 41BB leads to a novel state of T cell dysfunction and evaluate translationally-relevant strategies for
advanced engineering that overcome this dysfunction-inducing circuitry."

 Over two decades of research has focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of working memory (WM)
deficits in patients with schizophrenia in the hopes of finding effective treatments, as these deficits are more
closely linked to functional outcomes in patients than are psychotic symptoms, and they are presumed to arise
from alterations in dopaminergic function that may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
However, the overwhelming majority of research in this area has treated WM as a unitary cognitive ability that
is assayed equally well by any of the wide range of tasks commonly employed in functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) studies of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that at least
three distinct cognitive abilities contribute to performance on WM tasks: attentional control, short-term
memory capacity, and long-term (or secondary) memory retrieval. These are presumed to have dissociable
neural substrates and may be differentially impaired in different patients, which would serve to obscure
potential biomarkers of WM deficit in case-control fMRI studies of patients. The NIMH Research Domain
Criteria (RDoC) Matrix attempts to capture some of this complexity by defining four subconstructs of WM
(active maintenance, flexible updating, limited capacity, and interference controls), although these differ from
those based on empirical work described above, and no empirical work to date has attempted to determine the
extent to which various WM tasks tap these four putative subconstructs. The overarching goal of this
application is to conduct a large-scale latent-variable analysis of the most commonly employed WM tasks in the
fMRI literature of schizophrenia, along with a broad array of other cognitive tasks, in order to clarify the
underlying cognitive abilities (or subconstructs) that subserve WM task performance and to identify neural
correlates of these empirically identified subconstructs. To this end, 500 participants will undergo behavioral
testing on 9 WM and 12 other cognitive tasks in order to provide a robust dataset for latent variable analysis
using factor analytic and structural equation modeling techniques that will identify the subconstructs that
underlie performance on each of the WM tasks. Next, 80 patients with schizophrenia and 80 matched control
participants will undergo the same battery of tasks, but will perform 7 of the WM tasks during fMRI scanning,
in order to identify neural correlates of the subconstructs that are specifically disrupted in schizophrenia. This
work will help to advance our understanding of WM deficits in schizophrenia and will identify specific neural
targets, and the optimal tasks that future investigators can employ to target them, that are disrupted in
schizophrenia. These neural targets can then form the basis for establishing target engagement in clinical trials
aimed at finding treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."

Changes to cerebral microvasculature that impact blood flow and blood brain barrier function are increasingly
recognized as a key feature of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. The underlying
cause of this dysfunction is largely unknown, though data from transgenic mice indicates pathways related to
microvascular stress (inflammation, senescence, and angiogenesis) are upregulated with increasing amyloid
beta and tau deposition. This research will make use of human tissue samples collected in the Massachusetts
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and mouse models to examine the contribution of
microvascular stress to AD. In Aim 1, we will determine when and where microvascular stress appears in
relation to accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and tangles. In Aim 2, we will determine if microvascular
stress contributes to functional weakening of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in AD by measuring a panel of
serum proteins and by microdissecting “leaky” and “non-leaky” vessels to identify a mechanistic basis for
dysfunction at the level of individual vessel segments. In Aim 3 we will manipulate gene expression in
endothelial cells and test the causal role of specific microvascular stressors to pathological AD changes. This
work will assess human vascular transcriptomes from multiple brain regions in Alzheimer’s, providing
unparalleled information about how vascular cells are affected by AD pathology and insight into variability of
human brain vasculature that might underlie regional differences in disease susceptibility. Further, we will
make use of innovative methods including multiplex immunofluorescence to measure up to 18 proteins in
tissue sections at once, clear brain preparations to assess spatial relationships between stress markers and
AD pathology, and a novel adeno-associated virus that can specifically target endothelial cells in vasculature
and that may be an exciting tool for future therapeutic gene delivery. Overall, these studies will significantly
contribute to our knowledge of the biological mechanisms of impaired microvascular function in AD and will
help uncover biomarkers to identify patient populations that would benefit from vascular-directed therapeutics
arising from this project."

Despites improvements in childhood cancer survival in the last several decades, marked racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic disparities in outcomes persist. Compared with non-Hispanic white children, non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic children experience lower survival from many cancers, including leukemia, the most commonly
diagnosed cancer in children. The underlying causes of these survival differences are poorly understood and
may vary by cancer type, and both biological and socioeconomic pathways have been proposed. Recent
evidence has suggested that lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with survival from some childhood
cancers. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is an international clinical trial cooperative group of over 200
hospitals which together treat more than 90% of all children and adolescents diagnosed with childhood cancer
in the United States and Canada. In 2007 the COG opened the Childhood Cancer Registration Network (CCRN;
COG protocol ACCRN07) to create a research registry. A total of over 56,000 childhood cancer cases were
enrolled on ACCRN07 through the end of enrollment on December 8, 2017. All children and parents enrolled on
ACCRN07 provided address information which was current at the time of diagnosis. We will work with
investigators at the Minnesota Population Center to geocode all ACCRN07 patients with a valid U.S. address,
contextualize with socioeconomic status data, and return small-area SES data to COG for dissemination. We
will contextualize each geocoded address with Census data at the block level using seven variables from these
data we will use factor analysis to derive a five-level SES indicator. We will then examine the influence of SES
on risk of minimum residual disease at the end of induction therapy, relapse, other serious toxicities and
adverse events, and survival in >9,500 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Over 9,500 ALL
patients on ACCRN07 with a valid address will also have been treated on COG protocols. Ours will be the first
study to evaluate SES as a predictor of childhood cancer outcomes on a large scale within the Children's
Oncology Group, and will include detailed cytogenetic and molecular characterization of each tumor. Additionally,
to our knowledge, this will be the first analysis of SES predictors of short-term treatment toxicities. We will create
a highly useful resource on a large scale for a contemporary cohort of childhood cancer patients. Our findings
will have translational potential in that outcomes related to SES may indicate the need to develop tailored
interventions for low-resource patient populations. Additionally, this cohort's utility will extend beyond outcomes
of therapy and into survivorship with linkages to the National Death Index (NDI) to obtain mortality data. Our
long-term goal is to understand the factors that contribute to disparities in childhood cancer relapse, survival,

Purpose: The REpeated ASSEssment of SurvivorS in ICH study will conduct long-term cognitive, functional,
and neuropsychiatric performance assessments to determine if evacuation of spontaneous intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) reduces the risk of later cognitive decline in the ageing brain. This study will compare rates
of cognitive decline under two treatment strategies for intracerebral hemorrhage: the use of minimally invasive
surgery with two similar techniques as performed in the recently completed MISTIE III and ENRICH trials, and
the current standard of care using data from both controls in MISTIE III and ENRICH and comparative data
from The Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH (ERICH) study (U-01-NS067963) extended into the ERICH-
Longitudinal study (R01-NS093870) which followed over 900 of the cases with serial cognitive examinations.
Rationale: Intracerebral hemorrhage has the highest disability rate among stroke survivors. ICH survivors are
at particularly high risk for progressive cognitive impairment which is strongly associated with greater
hematoma volume, but also with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Compared with standard of care, minimally
invasive surgery with effective hematoma volume reduction may improve long-term functional outcomes while
also reducing mortality. As such, reducing hematoma volume after ICH may reduce the risk of post ICH
cognitive decline.
Design: REASSESS ICH is a longitudinal structured serial telephone interview follow-up plus one-time in-
person visit of an anticipated 359 ICH survivors enrolled in MISTIE III (2013-2017) or ENRICH (2018-2022).
Cognitive and functional outcome data will be compared with up to 900 patients enrolled in ERICH-L, to
determine if surgical ICH reduction leads to reduced risk of progressive cognitive decline.
Primary Aim 1: To determine if surgical clot reduction after ICH reduces the risk of progressive cognitive
decline. Hypothesis: The final residual volume of ICH will correlate with risk of cognitive decline after controlling
for age, sex, initial volume of ICH, leukoaraiosis, APOE genotype, and hypertension treatment among operated
and non-operated survivors of MISTIE III/ENRICH and survivors of ERICH, and effective clot reduction (<20
mL end of treatment volume), will be associated with lower risk of cognitive decline compared to non-operated
patients.
Primary Aim 2: To determine if there is a long-term benefit in survival and functional outcome from minimally
invasive surgery and the interaction with cognitive decline. Hypothesis: Effective clot reduction will be
associated with a decreased risk of death/major disability compared to non-operated patients.
Exploratory Aim 3: To determine if inflammatory gene pathway expression predicts risk of cognitive decline.
Hypothesis: Chronic brain inflammation contributes to progressive cognitive impairment post ICH. Our
preliminary data identifies that inflammation appears to occur chronically after ICH; not just acutely. When
testing a wide variety of gene expression changes, the context of which pathway is involved is critical to
provide context. We will evaluate whether inflammatory pathways in particular predict patients with cognitive
impairment independent of gene risk scores for dementia and surgical status."

Research: Up to 30% of patients with treatment refractory UC will require surgery, the most common of which is
the RPC with IPAA. This continence preserving procedure involves the removal of the colon and rectum,
construction of a pouch from ileum to serve as an internal pelvic reservoir for stool, and restoration of intestinal
continuity. Approximately 20% of patients develop CDLPI within two years of their final surgical stage, and up to
50% of these patients do not respond to standard IBD therapies and require surgical pouch removal and the
creation of a permanent ostomy. To date, there is no way to predict before colon removal which patient with UC
will develop CDLPI and pouch failure. We propose to characterize the genetic variants, ileal transcriptome,
microbial and metabolomic profiles associated with CDLPI in patients with UC who undergo RPC with IPAA. We
hypothesize that patients who develop CDLPI harbor distinctive at risk genetic and ileal transcriptomic features
present at the time of colectomy before pouch creation, and that CDLPI is triggered over time by exposure to
specific microbiota."

and will be used to gather information on patients' pain, momentary cognitions, affects, and coping
behaviors, for a 2-week monitoring period prior to the beginning of treatment. Therapists will use this
information to develop an individual functional analysis of pain and non-pain episodes, and determine
what thoughts, feelings and actions are effective for that patient at managing pain and which are not.

10779818,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The transition to motherhood brings dramatic changes in physiology and brain function. This includes changes
to neural circuits regulating maternal care, threat and stress responses, which are essential for the survival and
well-being of the offspring. Human and animal studies highlight the importance of resilient threat and stress
responses to efficient maternal care. Clinical work suggests that improving emotional states of the mother is
promising for engaging more successfully with her progeny. Corticolimbic circuits play a crucial role in threat
and stress responses. However, little is known about the interactions between corticolimbic circuitry and core
maternal brain regions, making it challenging to relate threat and stress responses to maternal care. To
address this gap in knowledge, we recently developed an approach to study corticolimbic brain regions. We
uncovered a distinct subpopulation of neurons within corticolimbic circuits that regulate maternal care, threat
and stress responses in the postpartum state. Our research will yield new insights into corticolimbic regulation
of maternal behaviors by defining the circuit, synaptic function and transcriptional mechanisms using a
combination of genetic technologies, neural-circuit dissection, synaptic electrophysiology as well as
biochemical and transcriptional tools. These approaches allow for a close examination of links between cell-
signaling, synapses and the neuronal nucleus within a specific cell population in relationship to the maternal
state. In Aim 1 we identify cell populations in corticolimbic areas responsible for maternal care and threat
responses postpartum, using chemogenetics, optogenetics, cell-type specific gene promoters, novel knock-in
mouse lines and viral vectors not previously tested in maternal behavior. In Aim 2 we define the synaptic
mechanisms behind maternal behaviors postpartum. We will conduct a detailed analysis of key synaptic
proteins, synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in corticolimbic circuits. Accomplishing aim will connect
neural circuits (studied in Aim 1) with synaptic mechanisms that are part of a key intracellular signaling
pathway that supports maternal care and threat responses postpartum. In Aim 3 we make some of the first
measurements of transcription in corticolimbic circuits postpartum. We will examine expression of candidate
genes in relevant brain regions for mothers of our newly developed transgenic mouse lines and compare these
genes to synaptic molecules studied in Aim 2 and to gene databases of human mental disorders with similar
neuronal mechanisms. Accomplishing Aim 3 will provide a mechanistic foundation for connecting corticolimbic
circuits (studied in Aim 1), synaptic proteins and synaptic function (studied in Aim 2) with maternal care and
threat responses and will be a source of new gene targets to test this connection. The results of this work will
guide neural circuit-based, gene-based and pharmacological strategies for improving mothers’ well-being and
their ability to take care of their offspring."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances in genomics technology and associated data analysis methods have provided
a framework to interrogate the human host response to vaccination and the dynamic interplay
between host and pathogen during viral infection at an unprecedented resolution. The integration
of molecular and cellular data alongside clinical metadata and serologic data nucleates the
potential to identify signatures of viral immunity outcomes by characterizing changes in innate
immunity before and after vaccination. However, no single technology is sufficient to address the
multitude of open questions raised by deep molecular immune profiling, necessitating an
integrated approach for profiling immunity and vaccine response. Analysis of PBMCs and
histocultures across VIVA projects with a variety of cutting-edge and custom high throughput,
molecular and high-resolution multi-omics technologies will provide the best database for vaccine
immune responses across these systems. The VIVA Genomics Core D aims to leverage a data
generation technology suite inclusive of bulk RNAseq, serologic data, single cell CITEseq,
CyTOF, spatial transcriptomics, viral genomics and multi-scale computational approaches for the
comprehensive characterization of immune response to predict vaccine outcomes. Using the
integration of these data, Core D will deliver multi-omics data generation and quality control for
seamless analysis, integration and annotation with the Genomics Data Analysis and Management
Core E across VIVA projects including the Immune/Clinical Core, Project 1 (SARS-CoV-2),
Project 2 (seasonal influenza), Project 3 (tetravalent DENV). Core D will serve as an invaluable
resource for the VIVA HIPC team coupling molecular data generation and Core E data driven
approaches to foster technology refinement and development and promote collaboration between
VIVA projects."
10783785,"Summary
Project 2 of our Virus Immunity and Vaccination Human Immunology Project Consortium is dedicated to
immune phenotype the responses to influenza virus vaccination and infection in humans. We propose to find
the host features that are associated with functional differences in the magnitude and duration of the immune
response to influenza vaccination and infection in adults. In fact, there is a dire need to understand the
mechanisms that are responsible for some people to have a limited response to influenza vaccines, while
some others become protected. We take advantage of already established longitudinal cohorts by our Clinical
Core, to understand factors associated with differential responses to influenza virus vaccination. Specifically,
we will study in detail and over the course of three seasonal vaccinations, the innate (Aim 1) and adaptive (Aim
2) immune responses induced in blood in individuals known to be good or bad responders to previous
vaccinations. In order to elucidate the immunophenotypes associated with vaccination versus infection, we are
also recruiting patients with active influenza virus infection and we will study changes in their host responses
and adaptive immune status associated with infection. In addition, we will use an innovative established ex vivo
human tonsil system to study differences in immune activation after influenza virus infection and vaccination
(Aim 3). Using this primary system, we plan to observe the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses
to different influenza viruses and vaccines at the cellular level and determine the impact of specific immune
pathways and cells in such responses. Extensive data on cytokine/chemokine levels and functional cell
populations will be collected using immune-genomics, serological, immune-phenotyping and multiplex assays
performed by our Research Cores. These studies will generate a wealth of transcriptional and functional data
related to the outputs of key innate immune and adaptive responses involved in eliciting a broad and durable
immune response against influenza. Collectively, we will define molecular signatures involved in the immune
response profiles elucidated after influenza virus infection and repeated vaccination, and we will identify
biomarkers that correlate with the magnitude and functional quality of the adaptive immune response to
influenza vaccination. Furthermore, the generated data by Project 2 on influenza virus infection and
vaccination will be integrated by our Data Management and Analysis Core with results generated in Projects
1 and 3 on human SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections and vaccinations, in order to establish commonalities
and differences on human immune responses elicited by different viruses and vaccine platforms. This Core will
also disseminate the data to the designated HIPC Coordinating Center and appropriate public databases, such
as ImmPort."
10783787,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito–borne virus infecting humans in tropical and subtropical
areas of the world. There are 4 DENV serotypes, namely DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4 circulating in
humans. Understanding the immunoprotective and immunopathogenic responses to dengue vaccines and
responses to dengue virus (DENV) infection are critical to the development of a safe and effective dengue
vaccine. To assess the innate and adaptive immune responses contributing to homo- and heterotypic immune
responses to dengue vaccination and infection, we will analyze samples obtained from two clinical trials which
evaluated the live attenuated dengue vaccine TV003 (LATV) or a trivalent admixture missing the DENV-2
component of TV003 (CIR287 and CIR300 respectively), against DENV-2 challenge. TV003 induced 100%
protection against viremia and rash following DENV-2 challenge, the trivalent formulation induced only 20%
protection against DENV-2 viremia. Using available samples from vaccine trials described above that are fully
characterized serologically, we will analyze the cellular immune responses in PBMCs generated in those
individuals over time, provided by the clinical core (Core B). With multiparametric immunological and genetic
approaches performed by the immune phenotyping core (Core C) and genetic core (Core D), we will profile
the innate and adaptive immune responses to tetra- and trivalent vaccine formulations (Aim 1) and to
challenge with rDEN230, a live attenuated DENV-2 discarded as vaccine component (Aim 2). Additionally,
we will use human tonsillar histocultures (HC) provided by core B to analyze the immune responses induced
by different admixtures of the dengue vaccines (Aim 3). Tonsils have a well-defined spatial architecture and
cellular microenvironments and can be readily dissociated for single cell assays. They also show important
features to understand the generation of innate and adaptive immune responses, like the formation of germinal
centers. These facts make them ideal for comparing cell suspension profiling assays such as Aurora flow
cytometry with tissue imaging approaches like spatial transcriptomics (Core D). The understanding of the
elements in the different vaccine formulations that confer immunogenicity and the contribution of the different
serotypes to vaccine efficacy will be crucial for the development of efficacious vaccines. Our approach will
provide important information on the generation of immune responses to vaccination and infections and the
immune signatures induced by protective vaccines versus less protective ones as determined by the data
management and analysis core (Core E). The analyses of the different cell populations present in PBMCs and
in the tonsil HC will expand our knowledge on generation of innate and adaptive immune responses and will
allow for the visualization of germinal center formation and other features important for the generation of
protective immune responses. The team assembled in this project has the right expertise in DENV biology,
immunology, and vaccine development."
10783788,"CORE E PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances in high-throughput immune phenotyping and genomic technologies have enabled profiling of
host immune responses to vaccination and infection at unprecedented detail, at both the tissue and cellular
level. The goal of the VIVA DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS CORE (DMAC, CORE E) will be to
provide comprehensive data management and computational analysis capabilities for the gene expression,
antibody, cytokine and chemokine profiles generated for PBMCs and plasma from vaccinated and infected
individuals, as well as from human tonsillar histocultures (HC) treated with different vaccines against Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; Project 1), influenza virus (IV; Project 2) or
Dengue virus (DENV; Project 3). In Aim 1, this core will perform computational analysis of high-throughput
tissue-level transcriptional, antibody, cytokine and chemokine profiles generated for all individuals and
histocultures in each project by the IMMUNE PHENOTYPING CORE (CORE C) and the GENOMICS CORE
(CORE D). In Aim 2, we will use the results from the analyses of bulk PBMC and plasma profiles – in close
coordination with each project team – to help inform the selection of samples for detailed profiling at the
cellular level using the latest single-cell CITEseq and spatial transcriptomics technologies by the GENOMICS
CORE. We will also be responsible for analyzing the resulting single-cell datasets using well-established
pipelines to show how changes in cell composition and expression at the cellular level drive changes at the
tissue level. In Aim 3 we will further combine data at the tissue and cellular level across all three projects for an
integrated analysis of host responses to vaccination against each pathogen to identify common and vaccine-
specific components of these responses. This integration will be facilitated by the centralized cross-project data
management facilities provided by this core, as well as coordinated data generation by the IMMUNE
PHENOTYPING CORE and GENOMICS CORE that use the same platforms and technologies to profile
samples across all projects. Finally, we will interface with ImmPort, directly or through the HIPC Coordinating
Center, to ensure that all data, analysis results, and analysis code is made publically available in a timely
manner. Altogether we expect that our multi-scale computational approaches will enable a comprehensive
characterization of the relationship between vaccination, host immune responses and vaccine outcomes."

The overall objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of a novel method
Although deposition of amyloid plaques in brain tissue is the clearest pathological
indicator of AD, it can only be detected during autopsy or positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging, which can be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the most widely used approach for
diagnosing AD continues to be the clinical recognition of cognitive impairment, a subjective
evaluation which only provides probable diagnosis when other causes of dementia are eliminated.
Because the optic nerve and retina are extensions of the central nervous system, several
investigations to seek have sought to link retinal features with onset of the disease. Using optical
coherence tomography (OCT), a correlation has been observed between thinning of the retinal
nerve fiber layer and AD but this feature can also indicate other diseases. Instead, we propose
to develop a diagnostic based on measuring structural features in the various layers of the retina,
specifically to identify a diagnostic metric of AD that is potentially distinct from other pathologies.
To meet this objective, we seek to develop angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI)
for clinical measurement of structural features of retinal layers. a/LCI is a light scattering method
that combines the sub-cellular sensitivity of light scattering with the depth resolution of OCT. It
has been shown to detect precancerous cells in esophagus and cervix using in vivo depth
resolved measurements of nuclear morphology. Rather than imaging the cellular structure of the
retina directly, we instead propose to use a/LCI to measure the micron-scale structural
characteristics of retinal layers. Preliminary data shows that a/LCI measurements of the
organization of these structures correlates with presence of AD in a murine model. The following
Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Implement integrated a/LCI & OCT system for in vivo studies of
the human retina. 2. Characterize retinal features in AD patients with a/LCI & OCT. This study
will confirm measurements from the animal model and provide data for establishing biomarkers
of AD in humans. 3. Conduct data analysis for biomarker development using morphological
descriptors and machine learning. 4. Perform in vivo prospective studies in AD patients to validate
biomarkers of structural changes as predictive of disease. Upon completion of this project, we will
have shown feasibility and provided justification for future development of a combined a/LCI &
OCT system for clinical screening for AD."

Pericytes are specialized mural cells in the basement membrane of brain capillaries. Their contact and
communication with the endothelium is critical for multiple aspects of vascular function, including control of
microvascular blood flow and blood-brain barrier integrity. There is significant evidence that increased loss of
pericytes occurs during Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's-related dementias, and that this loss causes
accelerated degradation of microvascular integrity, leading to neuronal dysfunction. Preserving pericyte-
endothelial contact may therefore improve cerebrovascular function in these neurodegenerative diseases.
However, there remain fundamental gaps in knowledge on how the adult brain responds to and recovers from
pericyte loss in vivo. We recently discovered that pericytes of the brain undergo a repair strategy to maintain
coverage of the endothelium in the event of pericyte loss (Berthiaume et al. Cell Reports, 2018, 22(1):8-16).
Pericytes can structurally remodel their far-reaching processes to invade endothelial regions that lack pericyte
contact. The goal of this project is to investigate this novel facet of brain pericyte biology and its role in
maintenance of capillary function. Our innovative approach will assess the effect of pericyte loss and repair in a
completely physiological setting. We will use high-resolution, in vivo two-photon microscopy to image and
selectively ablate pericytes, while assessing capillary hemodynamics, tissue oxygenation, and neural synaptic
activity. This approach provides an exceptionally clear view of how the brain responds to pericyte loss, and the
reparative responses that are mounted over days. In Aim 1, we will determine how the pericyte remodeling
mechanism manages graded increases in severity of pericyte loss. We will examine the physiological
consequence of this pericyte loss on capillary flow, structure and integrity, and determine whether the repair
capacity is diminished with increasing age. In Aim 2, we will examine how pericyte loss alters the
microstructure of tissue oxygen distribution and neuronal synaptic function using novel imaging probes. In Aim
3, we will determine whether pericyte remodeling is altered by activation or inhibition of PDGF-B/PDGFRβ, a
key signaling pathway for developmental recruitment of pericytes to their peri-endothelial niche. If successful,
our aims will establish whether it is useful to restore pericyte coverage in conditions such as Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias. We will obtain information on how selective pericyte loss in adult and aged
brain affects the dynamics of capillary function. Finally, we will establish novel methods to quantify and
manipulate pericyte remodeling, allowing the phenomenon to be studied broadly in other models of
cerebrovascular disease."

10788368,"This application proposes to develop fundamental genomic and bioinformatic resources that will better enable
studies of the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). The axolotl provides the best model for identifying mechanisms
of regeneration that can translate to humans. This is because it can regenerate multiple damaged body parts,
including whole limbs, spinal cord, and brain, and because it shares tetrapod biology with human. Understanding
how axolotls regenerate complex tissues may reveal mechanisms to activate stem cells within human tissues to
organize and reform damaged tissues. Beyond regeneration, the axolotl presents many untapped disease
models that were identified and rigorously examined with traditional developmental approaches before the
genetics/genomics era. With our recent development of the first chromosome-scale assembly of the axolotl
genome, these and new models that will be created in coming years through genome editing, can be advanced
for the first time to significantly impact biomedical research. However, to advance these models, improvements
of the genome assembly are needed along with new datasets to enable genome-wide studies of the large axolotl
genome. To accomplish these objectives, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will resolve inter- and
intra-specific variation within the current assembly and resolve complex repetitive regions that have hampered
the placement of ~6 Gb of the 32 Gb genome. Specifically, we will employ a powerful trio binning strategy that
takes advantage of long read sequencing of DNA from axolotl x tiger salamander (A. tigrinum) hybrids. This
approach leverages decades of experience in generating interspecific hybrids to resolve assembly gaps/errors
and accurately place gene models within their non-coding regulatory environments. Additionally, we will analyze
sequence data from 10 AGSC axolotls from branches of the pedigree that optimally sample laboratory genetic
diversity. In Aim 2, we will perform Chip-Seq to identify changes in histone post-translational modifications during
tail and limb regeneration. Characterization of epigenetic marks for embryo, larval, and adult models of
regeneration will provide new resources for regeneration research and advance community efforts in performing
genome wide studies. Aim 3 will address significant community needs, user-friendly access to large scale
genomic datasets and improvement of genomic and bioinformatic capabilities of investigators in the axolotl
community. Accomplishment of these aims will significantly advance axolotl as an animal model for biomedical
research."
10788370,"Project Summary
Breast cancer accounts for the second most cancer-related deaths in U.S. women despite the
availability of improved treatment options and increased screening. A particularly aggressive
subtype that represents a disproportionate number of these mortality cases is basal-like breast
cancer (BLBC). The high mortality of BLBC stems from a lack of effective, sustainable
chemotherapeutic treatment options with tumors often developing resistance to treatment despite
encouraging treatment responses. This higher relapse rate among BLBC patients calls for the
development of more effective therapeutic regimens targeting distinct molecular alterations of
basal-like tumors. Strikingly, we find that BLBC, but not luminal breast cancer cell lines, exhibit a
severe sensitivity to partial suppression of leading strand replicative polymerase, DNA
polymerase epsilon (POLE). POLE suppression in BLBC cells leads to replication fork stalling,
DNA damage, and a senescence-like state or cell death. Our preliminary data, which form the
premise of my application, reveals that suppression of POLE in a BLBC cell line, but not other
breast cancer cell lines, results in an increase in inflammatory cytokine transcripts known to be
targeted by the NF-𝜅B transcription factor, a phenotype that is dependent upon RELA expression.
This cytokine production is sufficient to impact the tumor immune microenvironment, as I
observed significant infiltration of F4/80 positive macrophages in BLBC xenografts upon POLE
suppression. Therefore, my central hypothesis is that NF-𝜅B activation upon POLE inhibition
activates a cytokine secretion program selectively in BLBC cells. In aim 1, I will analyze activation
of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and NF-𝜅B via immunoblot, immunofluorescence for NF-
𝜅B subcellular localization, and an NF-𝜅B luciferase reporter. I will delineate which PRRs (cGAS-
STING, MAVS-RIG-I) and NF-𝜅B components (IKK-g, p65, RELB) are triggered by replication
stress, and use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate cell lines lacking key signaling components to uncover
those responsible for NF-𝜅B activation. In aim 2, I will determine the impact of POLE suppression
on intra-tumoral cytokine expression and tumor cell composition. If immune infiltration is altered,
I will determine the degree of cooperation with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This work is
impactful because it will discriminate whether replication stress induced by inhibiting leading
strand replication triggers an immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive environment that could
be targeted to enhance future anti-cancer therapies."

This app will be specifically designed and tested for older adult drivers with AD, ADRD, or cognitive impairment. This is critical as this product will extend older adult driver’s mobility for as long as possible, while keeping themselves and other road users safe. Driving is essential for the preservation of functional independence for older adults, yet there is a growing body of evidence that older adult drivers with cognitive impairment have a higher crash risk relative to older adult drivers who are not cognitively impaired. Older adult drivers are already overrepresented in motor vehicle crash deaths and injuries. The project team is uniquely suited to successfully carry out this research due to our unique combination of skills and abilities, which includes a history of developing products for older adults, including the use of telematics and driving data in applications, research using driving apps and coaching drivers, and research in AD and ADRD, including cognition-driving studies.

NIH funding. U54 PI, Drs. Ernest Martinez (UCR) and Victoria Seewaldt (CoH) have extensive mentorship
experience and will lead the Capacity Core. Under the Capacity Core, UCR-CoH Mini-Pilots will be 1) crafted by
ESIs under senior mentorship, 2) competed, and 3) teams awarded $100,000 for one year. Our P20 planning
grant shows us that success of a pilot project is increased when ESI have senior mentors from both CoH and
UCR; therefore UCR ESI applying for Mini-Pilots are required to have a CoH and UCR mentor. In Years 1 and
2 a total of 3 Mini-Pilots will be funded/year. These 6 Mini-Pilots will be an important opportunity for us to build
joint UCR ESI-CoH grants and capacity at UCR. In Years 3-5, $200,000 originally allocate to the Capacity
Building Core, will be re-allocated to support two new Pilots – Pilots 3 and 4. In Years 3-5, we will offer 1 Mini-

American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican-
Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and
institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific
focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on
cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in

disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two
foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate
cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino
investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity
research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings
in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in

The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by
the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and
nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to
train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research,
to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The

10931529,"ABSTRACT – FULL PROJECT 4 LUNG
Lung cancer is a prominent source of cancer health disparity, particularly in Black men. While they have lower
exposure to cigarette smoke, the most common risk factor for lung cancer, Black men have a 37% higher risk
for lung cancer than White men. In addition, the 5-year survival of Black men and women is below that of White
subjects. Numerous causes likely underlie these differences, including genetic differences. The latter may affect
the metabolism of nicotine/tobacco smoke components, responses to therapy, and differences in cancer driver
gene mutations. To understand the effects of the genetic differences between racial/ethnic groups on lung cancer
development and treatment, we need to characterize the driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, the
most common type of lung cancer) in Black Americans and develop in vitro lung cancer model systems that
reflect the relevant mutations in the correct genetic background. There is a notable lack of cell line models for
lung adenocarcinoma from Black Americans, with no Black cell lines from alveolar epithelial cells (the LUAD
progenitors) and only 5 known LUAD cell lines (compared to 67 White cell lines). While targeted therapies are
available for a subset of LUAD, in vitro systems to test therapeutics in Black Americans are sorely lacking. We
hypothesize that due to genetic differences, LUAD in Blacks will have a unique repertoire of cancer driver genes
and will respond to targeted therapies distinctly from white LUAD. This proposal represents an interdisciplinary
collaboration in which a medicinal (bio)chemist from FAMU (Dr. Lamango), a biomedical engineer from UF (Dr.
Huang), and a molecular geneticist from USC (Dr. Offringa) combine their innovative resources to tackle the
pronounced health disparities in lung cancer in Black Americans. We will do so through three Specific Aims: In
Aim 1, we will identify the main driver mutational signatures of lung adenocarcinoma from 100 Black Americans,
who are 5-fold underrepresented in mutational studies. In Aim 2, we will develop new immortalized alveolar and
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines from Black subjects and use these and existing cell lines to develop 2-
dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro models. We will test promising drugs (polyisoprenylated
cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs)) developed by the Lamango lab, that target the KRAS pathway which is
frequently mutated in LUAD. As time allows we will also test other targeted therapeutics and combinations of
drugs. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel 3D-printed bone cancer metastasis model to study the differential efficacy
of PCAIs and other targeted therapeutics on cancer cell cytotoxicity, migration, and invasion. Bone is the most
common metastatic site of LUAD. The three proposed Specific Aims address the lack of knowledge about cancer
driver genes in Black American lung adenocarcinoma, generate a collection of normal alveolar and lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines from Black subjects that will be used to establish race-appropriate models and will be
a great resource for others, and allow the testing of therapeutics on cells from Black Americans using 2D, 3D,
and bone metastasis models."
10761706,"Population Biology of African Malaria Vectors and Parasites
Malaria is the most fatal vector-borne disease in Africa. At present, the first-line
intervention tools are insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spray that target
indoor-biting mosquitoes. However, the spread of insecticide resistance and increasing
outdoor biting behaviors of the malaria vectors has significantly hindered the
effectiveness of these tools, resulting slow progress of malaria control in the past
several years across Africa. In addition, the African continent has been experiencing
very rapid environmental changes such as urbanization, deforestation, dam
construction, irrigation and the resulting agricultural practice shift in the past two
decades. On top of the vector behavioral change and insecticide resistance
development, rapid environmental changes in the African continent have added
additional challenges in malaria control. Addressing these challenges in malaria control
requires knowledge on the impact of environmental modification on vector biology and
epidemiology, and requires optimization of the vector control methods that are adaptive
to the rapidly changing vector ecology and malaria epidemiology. Recent advancements
in molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics and ecological modeling, provide exciting
opportunities for developing new malaria vector control tools and application strategies.
Unfortunately, a large number of scientists from malaria-endemic countries have not
been able to leverage these new technologies extensively in their research. The specific
scientific objectives of this competing renewal application focus on mechanistic studies
on the impact of environmental modifications on malaria vector biology, epidemiology,
and development and evaluation of new malaria vector control tools and application
strategies. The overarching goal of this program is to advance the career development
of promising young scientists from sub-Saharan African countries and assist them
address the new challenges in malaria vector control in their regions. We propose to
accomplish this goal by training four postdoctoral fellows and eight Ph.D. students from
malaria-endemic Africa, and through workshops and “training the trainers” sessions to
broaden the impact of this program. In addition to obtaining research experience in
molecular biology, bioinformatics, vector ecology and epidemiology, the program will
offer a core training curriculum that focuses on biostatistics, bioinformatics, modeling,
scientific writing and responsible conduct of research. The superb infrastructure and
capacity at the international training sites in Kenya and Ethiopia and at the University of
California at Irvine are ideal for the proposed training. This training program will
contribute significantly to malaria research capacity building in Africa and career
development of African scientists by bridging laboratory and field research experience in
vector biology and malaria epidemiology, by equipping them with new technologies, by
providing opportunities for them to develop valuable Africa-wide and international
linkages, and empowering them to build and develop independent research capacity
and projects."
10760209,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microglia and astrocytes have long been suspected of participating in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). However, it is not clear how these cells orchestrate their reactions in AD and whether they play protective
or deleterious roles that can be targeted therapeutically. We recently discovered a potentially neuroprotective
function that we termed the “microglia barrier”. We found that the robust encapsulation of Aβ deposits by
microglia processes cause Aβ aggregates to become compact, less toxic and insulated from adjacent neurites,
thereby reducing the formation of dystrophic axons. This neuroprotective function was severely disrupted in mice
lacking Trem2 or Dap12, which have defects in microglia polarization towards plaques, leading to a more diffuse
plaque conformation and worsening of axonal dystrophy. In this proposal, we aim to explore the possibility that
in addition to microglia, the astrocytic reaction to early amyloid aggregates and the coordinated reaction between
these two cell types is critical for the overall glial protective function. We will utilize sophisticated super-resolution
imaging of mouse and human brain, intravital optical imaging and in vivo single cell manipulations to investigate
the cellular and molecular basis of astrocyte and microglia orchestrated interactions and polarization towards
amyloid deposits. We will also explore signaling pathways that can be targeted to enhance this neuroprotective
glial barrier and reduce AD-associated axonal pathology."
10759430,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE A)
The overall goals of the Administrative Core (Core A) are to provide scientific, programmatic and fiscal leader-
ship, facilitate lines of communication between the different researchers involved in the PPG, maintain cohe-
rence in the PPG’s overall and long-range goals, and ensure that resources resulting from the PPG will benefit
the scientific community. Core A will thus provide the mechanisms to manage, evaluate, and evolve the four
Research Projects and two Research Cores in the program. In the context of the above, the task of Core A will
be the effective coordination of the activities of all the components, such as the selection and design of jointly
used models and resources (cell lines, mouse models, transposon reporters, protocols, etc.), the development
of new technologies and tools to more effectively promote the research goals, and enabling the scientific
community access to the PPG’s resources, technologies, and databases. The following activities will also
contribute to achieving these overall goals: 1) Core A will ensure that the administrative and financial
requirements of the NIH and the participating institutions are met; 2) Core A will organize monthly
videoconferences and annual face-to-face retreats; 3) Core A will be responsible for communications between
the PPG and the NIH; 4) Core A will facilitate the submission of joint publications and, in collaboration with Core
B, the deposition of high-throughput datasets into public databases; 5) Core A will establish the External Advisory
Board (EAB) and organize the annual reviews of the PPG."
10759433,"Core Summary
Core B will provide cutting edge tools to measure retrotransposition in
multicellular eukaryotes in the context of aging paradigms with a special focus on
Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. In addition to providing appropriate
existing assays and mouse models to all of the participants, the core will also
develop improved retrotransposition reporters and genomics tools to enable the
detection and mapping of retrotransposition events in the various experimental
systems under study. The Core will also provide “Driver systems” that lead to
high level expression of these elements in both cell systems and animals. Finally,
the core will provide cutting edge sequencing and computational tools to analyze
both retrotransposition itself and the aberrant forms of LINE-1 expression and
reverse transcription observed in aging cells and organisms."
10872227,"Analysis of RTs from other retroviruses in vitro suggests that HIV RT has exceptionally low fidelity. For example,
MuLV-RT shows ~5-fold greater fidelity than HIV RT on both RNA and DNA templates across several
publications from different groups, and even in identical experiments in the same publication. Yet cellular
replication data indicates that these viruses have similar mutation rates. The mutation profile observed in cellular
assay with HIV is also inconsistent with in vitro results. Recently, our lab and others have found that the in vitro
fidelity of HIV RT improves when physiological concentrations of free Mg2+ (~0.25-1 mM) are used as opposed
to the higher (5-10 mM) concentration optimized for in vitro activity that have typically been used in fidelity assays
in vitro . This may be one factor, possibly among many, that explains differences between HIV RT and other viral
RTs. MuLV and AMV RTs, for example, do not show significantly improved fidelity in lower Mg2+ and MuLV RT
has an error rate in vitro that is more consistent with cellular replication values. The lack of correlation with
respect to the overall mutation rate and spectrum of mutations observed in vitro vs. cellular replication has made
it impossible to determine RT’s contribution to the mutation spectrum observed in cells. This in turn makes it
difficult to assess the contributions of mutagenic cellular factors (e.g., APOBEC3G, UNG, and RNA polymerase
II) to the observed spectrum. A thorough understanding of the factors that contribute to the genetic diversity of
HIV will require a better understanding of HIV RT’s role in the process, and a clear definition of the mutation rate
and spectrum observed with HIV RT in vitro, and during virus replication in cells. Understanding how HIV
generates genetic diversity, which fuels the production of new viruses that can escape immunity and drug
therapy, has been a long-standing goal of HIV researchers. We believe this proposal will move us forward toward
this goal. New high fidelity Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches, including Single Strand Consensus
Sequencing (SSCS) and duplex sequencing, allow the rapid analysis of thousands of mutations in a single
experiment and has brought in a new era for mutational analysis. The same can be said for recent findings from
Dr. Wes Sundquist’s lab, our collaborator on this work, that demonstrate the complete replication of HIV dsDNA
in a highly efficient cell-free virion-based endogenous reverse transcription (referred to as “ERT” in this proposal)
system. By applying modern NGS approaches to DNA synthesis with purified RT in vitro, in ERT reactions, and
during virus replication in cells, the mutation rates and spectrums of these processes can be directly compared.
Notably, this will be the first fidelity analysis in the novel ERT system. This will more clearly define RT’s role and
relative contribution to HIV mutagenesis, and the roles of virion and cellular factors. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To use
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to compare the mutation rates and spectrums from purified HIV RT and
highly efficient Endogenous Reverse Transcription (ERT) assays; Aim 2: To compare the rate and spectrum of
mutations made by purified RT and in ERT reactions, to those observed during reverse transcription in cells."
10897063,"Coccidioidomycosis (CM) is an endemic mycosis caused by the fungi Coccidioides immitis and
Coccidioides posadasii, which is native to arid regions of North and South America. It is
estimated that up to 350,000 infections occur annually in the U.S. Additionally, up to a third of
community acquired pneumonia cases in these areas are thought to be a result of CM.
Morbidity associated with CM is substantial with a median illness duration of 120 days. The
costs associated with CM are high, with an estimated annual direct healthcare cost of nearly
$200 million.
Currently, the diagnosis of CM is primarily based on detection of anti-Coccidioides antibodies.
Once infection clears, the antibody eventually becomes undetectable making it difficult to
determine if there was previous exposure. Classically, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions
using skin tests have been used to evaluate the cellular immune response, which is indicative of
past infection. The commercially available Coccidioides skin test has suboptimal performance
characteristics and is not utilized often in clinical care.
The use of an ex vivo cytokine release assay (CRA) avoids the limitations associated with skin
testing while allowing for the detection of cytokines produced by stimulation with a pathogen-
specific antigen. Analogous to the commercially available CRA for tuberculosis, a Coccidioides
CRA would be a major advance for patient care and for evaluation of CM prevalence within
geographical regions and populations. Our data suggests a CRA for CM will be valuable as a
tool to detect patients with acute CM and stratify those with latent CM (those at risk for
reactivation if immunosuppressed). Climate change and incidence modelling predict endemicity
to expand from 12 to 18 states and incidence to increase by 50%, stressing the need for a
public health screening tool to establish changing boundaries and stratification for high risk
occupations and future vaccine trials.,
The goal of this application is to develop a CRA to assist in the diagnosis, management, and
epidemiology of CM, which increasingly afflicts people living in or travelling through areas where
it is endemic. This phase II grant will seek to establish and define the prototype assay for clinical
use."

10766140,"CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION – SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination Core (CRTEC) is to provide, integrate,
and coordinate education, training, and career development activities across all Research Programs within the
UVACC community. It does so in the setting of a highly collaborative cross-campus education and professional
development portfolio offered through the UVA Schools of Medicine, Engineering and Applied Science, Arts &
Science, Data Sciences, and Education. With this strong infrastructure in hand, the CRTEC Core partners with
the CCSG Research Programs and Shared Resources to provide trainees with a program of study built on a
platform of impactful cancer research, an innovative cancer-focused curriculum, and robust career
development programs. The CRTEC also works with departments, divisions, and UVACC Members to offer
strong mentoring and career development for junior faculty in the UVACC. Finally, it coordinates cancer-
focused educational and experiential initiatives for grade and high school students, and partners with the
Research Programs and Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) Core to provide continued education
for health care professionals on-site and within the catchment area. In each of these endeavors, the CRTEC
Core places value on engaging a diverse community of learners that will enhance the research and
educational enterprise of the UVACC. Our education and training programs have met with great success
during the previous grant cycle, with strong publication records, numerous awards and fellowships, competitive
postdoctoral and faculty positions for our trainees; advancement for our junior faculty; and training for our
health care professionals. These accomplishments will be augmented by several new initiatives planned for
the next grant cycle, which include (1) expanding our footprint in K-12 education; (2) partnering with COE to
use telemedicine and the Project ECHO platform to help educate health care providers in our catchment area;
and (3) formalizing a summer research program for faculty from minority-serving institutions that will open
doors to new multi-institutional collaborations and encourage their students to pursue careers in cancer
research."
10766142,"CANCER BIOLOGY (CBIO) – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A critical need remains for new therapies to treat various types of cancer. The discovery of new therapies
begins with uncovering the basic mechanisms that drive cancer, identifying the critical components of those
mechanisms, and then subsequently targeting them with small molecules that act as drugs for cancer therapy.
The Cancer Biology (CBIO) program exists to unite University of Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) investigators
whose research programs collectively make discoveries about mechanisms that drive cancer and advance that
knowledge through to the identification of therapeutic targets and development of small molecule modulators to
interfere with these targets. The CBIO program has a robust research base of investigators working to
elucidate mechanisms driving cancer, particularly with respect to how various signaling networks contribute to
tumor initiation and metastasis (Aim 1) and to validate individual proteins in tumors as targets for small
molecule modulators and identify or develop small molecule modulators of validated targets in cancers (Aim 2).
Investigators work to develop an understanding about how receptors and intracellular signaling support
homeostasis in normal tissues and how mutations perturb these networks. These efforts are critical to identify
pathways that represent vulnerabilities in particular cancers leading to new targets for validation and
development of small molecule modulators. The identification of novel targets feeds subsequent efforts to
move small molecule therapeutics further along the pipeline toward clinical application in conjunction with the
Cancer Therapeutics Program (CRX). The CBIO program has two co-leaders: Bushweller leverages his
expertise in chemical and structural biology within the Program to support and enhance cancer research;
Gioeli's experience in industry developing a novel pre-clinical model for target identification, validation, and
drug discovery enables him to support CBIO Program goals. The Program consists of 53 members, 17 of
whom are new to UVA or the UVACC, from 10 departments and three schools. The Program Members are
principal investigators of grants totaling $12.83M of current direct cost peer-reviewed funding with $3.29M from
NCI and $9.54M from other agencies. Twelve CBIO Program Members participate in one or more of the
disease-specific Translational Research Teams, which were created to spawn research in cancers that are
over-represented in the UVACC catchment area; three CBIO members serve as basic science co-leaders, thus
leveraging basic science expertise to advance research in cancers of particular relevance. CBIO Members
depend on the Shared Resources provided by the UVACC, particularly the Advanced Microscopy Facility, the
Biomolecular Analysis Facility, the Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility, and the Flow Cytometry Core.
Together, these activities culminated in 236 selected publications since the last grant period. Of these, 34%
have an impact factor of 10 or greater, 19% are intra-programmatic, 27% are inter-programmatic with other
UVACC Programs, and 21% are collaborative with other NCI Cancer Centers."

Genetics and Epigenetics Program (GEN) are to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie these
defects and to unleash the potential of precision medicine. The Program capitalizes on the large number of
outstanding investigators at UVA with research expertise in chromatin architecture, transcription, replication,
DNA repair, genomics, epigenomics and cellular checkpoints in cancer. The Members are organized around
three main themes: (1) chromosome function, malfunction, and cellular checkpoints; (2) changes to gene
expression and epigenetics that drive cancer; and (3) cancer bioinformatics. H. Li and Stukenberg bring
complementary clinical/translational and fundamental biological expertise to lead GEN. The Program has 24

Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) investigators whose multi-disciplinary research programs collectively support
preclinical science, validation of therapeutic targets, and translation of discoveries into investigator-initiated
clinical trials (IITs). A hallmark of the CRX program is to drive discoveries and new technologies along the
Translational Pipeline to obtain the UVACC's ultimate goal of reducing the burden of cancer in the catchment

The goals of the Cancer Control and Population Health (CPH) Research Program are to comprehensively
investigate cancer etiology and disparities and to develop and implement interventions that reduce the burden
and improve the outcomes of cancer in the University of Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) catchment area and
beyond. With significant institutional investment, the CPH program has enjoyed significant growth in the last
five years and has matured into a fully developed scientific program. Program members have expertise in
cancer epidemiology, behavioral medicine, health services research, quality of life research, and community-
engaged interventions to address the following two aims: 1) Identify and investigate a confluence of biological,
behavioral, and socioeconomic factors and mechanisms driving disparities in cancer risk and outcomes; and 2)
Develop novel interventions and conduct implementation research in diverse populations to reduce cancer risk
and cancer disparities. CPH has 2 co-leaders: L. Li is an expert in cancer etiology and health disparities
research and Anderson's extensive health services research focused on cancer health disparities in low
income and rural populations is ideally suited for the largely rural population we serve. The Program consists of
26 members, 16 of whom are new to UVA or the UVACC since the prior renewal, from 9 departments and 2
schools. This highly effective Program has successfully created synergy among the Members and inter-
programmatic and across-institutional collaborations. CPH Members are principal investigators of grants
totaling $6.38M direct costs of peer-reviewed funding, of which $2.19M is from NCI and $4.19M is from other
peer-reviewed sources. CPH is composed of highly productive and collaborative members with 306 total

programmatic, 13% are inter-programmatic with other UVACC Programs, and 60% are collaborative with other
NCI Cancer Centers. The overall research strategy of the CPH Program is to reduce the risk and burden of
cancer in the catchment area through identification and discovery of factors related to cancer risk, improving
access to prevention and treatment, and improving general health and preventive behaviors. This strategy
focuses on the high-priority areas of the UVACC including cancers related to tobacco and obesity (especially
lung and colorectal) as demonstrated through Program Member research seeking to identify new determinants
of cancer risk, behavioral risk reduction, and treatment."
10766156,"SHARED RESOURCES MANAGEMENT – PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the University of Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) Shared Resources is to provide high quality,
value-added support for UVACC Members as aligned with the goals of the UVACC. The management of the
Shared Resources is focused on effectively managing the Shared Resources; ensuring that the Shared
Resources meet the scientific needs of the UVACC Members; and planning for future directions and needs of
the UVACC for Shared Resource support.
At the last renewal of the UVACC, seven Shared Resources were submitted including Advanced Microscopy
Facility (AMF) (Scored Outstanding to Excellent), Animal Models of Disease Core (AMDC) (Scored Excellent),
Bioinformatics Core (BIC) (Scored Very Good to Excellent), Biomolecular Analysis Facility (BAF) (Scored
Outstanding), Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility (BTRF) (Scored Very Good to Excellent),
Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) (Scored Outstanding to Excellent), and Flow Cytometry Core (FCC)
(Scored Excellent to Outstanding). In the current submission, the UVACC also proposes seven Shared
Resources. However, in response to the requests from UVACC Program Leaders, and based on suggestions
from the last review and external reviewers, the UVACC reorganized and enhanced the Animal Models of
Disease Core to include additional protocols and technology for studying immune response in cancer and
cancer therapy and renamed the core the Molecular and Immunological Translational Sciences Core (MITS).
Given that most of the bioinformatics efforts are in association with support of the data-intensive platforms
present in the BAF (such as DNA and RNA sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics) the BIC is now
embedded within the BAF. To support researchers in the Cancer Control and Population Health Program
(CPH), we have added one Shared Resource, the Population Health and Cancer Outcome Core (PHCOC).
These changes in structure, along with focused improvements to the Shared Resources per the
recommendations of the last review, position the UVACC Shared Resources to provide exceptional expertise,
support, and education for Members' pursuit of cancer research as aligned with the mission of the UVACC."
10766162,"Project Summary/Abstract
Husbandry and Management Core
 The Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) has a long and successful history of breeding
rhesus macaques of Indian origin for HIV/AIDS research. This success can be attributed, in part, to continuous
U24/U42 support for the management and care of this colony. Since 2002, this support has allowed the rhesus
macaque breeding colony at the Yerkes NPRC Field Station to establish a colony pedigree, to transition to full
SPF status, to institute MHC profiling, and to validate a rapid in-house Herpes B virus (Macacine herpesvirus
1) screening protocol. Over the past 4 years, the number of individual NIH-funded HIV/AIDS-related projects
requiring SPF rhesus monkeys has remained relatively steady, and we are now seeing a post-COVID increase
in animal requests. Thus, the main objective of the Husbandry and Management Core for the current U42
application is to leverage the resources provided by the U42 to maximize production of SPF Indian rhesus
monkeys and facilitate allocation of these animals for NIH-funded HIV/AIDS research. As part of Aim 1, the
Husbandry and Management Core will continue to maintain the SPF status and genetic health as well as the
physical and social health of the Colony in order to produce high quality animals with desired MHC genotypes
for HIV/AIDS research. As part of Aim 2 to maximize animal production potential, the Husbandry and
Management Core will revise the strategies for improving the social competence of young future male breeders
and for forming multi-male cohorts of breeders to improve the success of male introductions, and implement a
social network analytical approach to assess stability in our large, compound-housed breeding groups, such as
fragmentation in matrilines, to improve social stability and avoid the detrimental effect that social instability has
on production. Finally, as part of Aim 3 to take an integrated approach to managing colony data sets, the
Husbandry and Management Core will transition away from storing socialization and social behavioral datasets
in compartmentalized spreadsheets to instead store them in the web-accessible Colony Informatics resource
and implement a project management dashboard to facilitate manipulation and summary of data regarding
animal availability, requests, and assignments to facilitate tracking and reporting. The success of these aims
will ensure that the SPF colony at YNPRC will continue to grow and provide a reliable supply of healthy and
genetically well-characterized rhesus macaques for HIV/AIDS research."

10766166,"The primary purpose of the Yerkes Viral Testing Core is to provide accurate, rapid, and cost-effective
serological and molecular viral diagnostic testing in support of the Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) colony at the
Yerkes National Primate Research Center. The Core employs a pipeline of diagnostic screens and tests which
provide definitive diagnoses for the presence of infection by the four viruses that constitute the standard panel
of viruses that are screened for by the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP)-supported SPF
macaque colonies: Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), Simian T Lymphotropic Virus (STLV), Simian type D
retroviruses (SRV), and Macacine herpesvirus 1 (B-virus). Testing for these viruses in the Yerkes SPF colony
has been ongoing for 16 years, and the SPF colony has been free of any of these 4 NHP viruses since 2013.
 Over the past funding period, the Core has increased its self-sufficiency and reduced turnover time in
reporting virological results critical for making colony management and animal assignment decisions by
establishing an in-house quantitative real-time PCR for the detection of Simian type D retrovirus (SRV) in
rhesus macaques. Previously, run on a fee-for-service basis at the California National Primate Research
Center, an in-house assay has significantly reduced both the cost and the turnaround time for the confirmation
of SRV infection in both SPF and non-SPF rhesus macaques at Yerkes. Additionally, the Viral Testing Core
has undergone a review of its Multiple Fluorescent Immunoassay (MFIA) thresholds for positivity. The Core
has also implement SARS-CoV-2 screening to ensure the health of the rhesus macaques and the animal
resources staff as well as to prevent any confounding complications that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have for
AIDS research.
 During the next funding period, the Viral Testing Core will continue to provide state-of-the-art viral
diagnostic services for the SPF breeding colony at Yerkes. Specifically, the Core will continue to develop virus
specific beads to increase the specificity of its MFIA screen. These beads will further enhance the efficiency of
its diagnostic pipeline. The Core will also add MFIA beads for non-SPF pathogens such as adeno-associated
viruses, several flaviviruses, and Trypansoma cruzi. Finally, the Core will continue to screen the SPF colony for
SARS-CoV-2 through both targeted swabbing of sick animals as well as fecal screening.
 The implementation of these tests will be critical (1) for the Yerkes Virology Core to provide cost effective,
efficient, and rapid SPF viral testing solutions, (2) for the ability of colony managers to make assignment and
husbandry decisions, and, most importantly, (3) for the success of AIDS researchers using nonhuman primates
at Yerkes."

 The Biomolecular Analysis Facility (BAF) provides a centralized setting for a diverse suite of services and
instrumentation in the `omics' (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics) and molecular
interaction and provides comprehensive bioinformatics support services such as pipelines and data analysis
tools. The facility is divided into sections that interact and support each other – Proteomics, Genomic Sciences,
Lipidomics/Metabolomics, Shared Instrumentation, and Bioinformatics. The resource serves University of
Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) Members by providing expertise in experimental design, sample processing,
cost-effective data collection, data analysis, and support for manuscripts and grants. UVACC investigators
have access locally to a wide variety of services that can determine qualitative and quantitative changes at the
cellular level, including Next Generation Sequencing, including bulk DNA/RNA-Seq, Single cell/nuclei RNA and
ATAC-seq, third generation long-read sequencing, quantitative gene expression, genotyping, complex protein
mixtures, biomarker profiling, post-translational modifications, molecular interactions and kinetics, lipids,
metabolites, and drug analysis. The consolidated organization of the facility allows UVACC Members to
perform many of these experiments on the same or related samples. One key area of focus within the BAF is
providing access to advanced instrumentation and experiments that meet UVACC needs. Within the past two
years, the facility added two mass spectrometers in the areas of proteomics and metabolomics and two higher
capacity NGS instruments. As the majority of BAF users are UVACC Members, the interaction with these
investigators is the driving force for acquiring new instrumentation and developing new techniques. The
UVACC Executive Committee and Office of Research Core Administration (ORCA – within School of Medicine
(SOM) Dean's Office) work closely together to foster this environment. To that end, the SOM provides direct
budget support to the BAF every year (~30% total budget), which together with the UVACC co-pay, provides
UVACC Members with highly effective services at remarkably competitive prices."

Molecular mechanisms regulating and interpreting BMP signaling
The highly conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulates multiple
developmental and homeostatic processes. Malfunction of the pathway can cause a myriad of
somatic and hereditary disorders in humans, including skeletal and cardiovascular diseases,
and cancer. Thus BMP signaling must be tightly regulated to ensure that signaling happens at
the right time, place, level and duration. Due to the vital developmental functions of BMP
signaling, it has been proposed that therapeutically targeting specific BMP modulators is a more
productive way for treating different diseases caused by defects in BMP signaling. C. elegans
provides an excellent model to study the regulation of BMP signaling at single cell resolution
during the development of an intact animal. Using a highly specific and sensitive genetic screen,
we have identified multiple evolutionarily conserved modulators of the BMP pathway. These
modulators include cell surface integral membrane or membrane-anchored proteins,
extracellular secreted proteins, as well as transcription factors. Our research goals under this
MIRA are to determine mechanistically how different BMP modulators function in regulating
BMP signaling, and how BMP signaling is interpreted in specific cellular contexts. We propose
to use a multifaceted approach that combines classical molecular genetic studies with cutting-
edge imaging, proteomic and metabolomic approaches to dissect the functions of the BMP
modulators in C. elegans. Findings from our proposed studies will yield important insights into
the complex and intricate mechanisms regulating and interpreting BMP signaling in a
multicellular living animal. They may also provide potential therapeutic targets for the different
diseases caused by mutations in the BMP pathway."
10915439,"Project Summary
R-loops are non-B DNA structures that form co-transcriptionally upon reannealing of the nascent transcript to
the DNA template strand, resulting in an RNA:DNA hybrid and a displaced single-strand of DNA. R-loops form
dynamically over thousands of conserved genic loci in mammalian genomes under normal conditions. However,
under conditions associated with dysfunctional RNA processing, “harmful” R-loops are thought to arise and
contribute to DNA damage and genome instability phenotypes, resulting in cancer or neurological diseases.
What differentiates normal and harmful R-loops remains unclear, and how harmful R-loops lead to DNA damage
is not fully understood. Our group recently identified two classes of R-loops: Class I R-loops form during RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) promoter-proximal pausing at an elevated frequency, while Class II R-loops occur
throughout gene bodies at moderate frequencies. Importantly, R-loop-associated genome instability phenotypes
can be relieved by overexpression of RNase H1, an enzyme that specifically degrades RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids.
The observation that RNase H1 primarily binds to promoter-proximal pause regions, and not gene body regions,
implicates Class I R-loops as major drivers of genome instability. I hypothesize that Class I R-loops become
elevated upon abnormal RNA processing, resulting in long-lasting paused RNAP polymerase II (RNAPII)
complexes, transcription-replication conflicts, and DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at promoter
regions. To test this hypothesis, I will build upon a cellular model of defective RNA export by depleting THOC5,
which is known to trigger R-loop-induced genomic instability and leverage integrative and unbiased genome-
wide mapping approaches to directly measure perturbations in R-loop formation, nascent transcription, and DSB
formation over time (Aim 1). I will overexpress (OE) RNase H1 in vivo and determine if it can suppress Class I
R-loops, reduce paused RNAPII complexes, and lower DSBs (Aim 2). To further clarify the mechanism of
genome stabilization by RNase H1 OE, I will investigate the possibility that RNase H1 activity permits the
termination of paused RNAPII complexes via the XRN2 (5’-3’ exoribonuclease 2) “torpedo” pathway, thus
relieving transcription-replication conflicts (Aim 3). I expect that this work will establish Class I R-loops associated
with paused RNAPII complexes as a major class of genome-destabilizing obstacles, clarifying the identity of
harmful R-loops and their impact on genomic stability. I also expect to reveal the molecular mechanism
underlying the ability of RNase H1 to stabilize the genome, addressing largely ignored gaps in knowledge and
highlighting novel roles for XRN2 in genome maintenance at promoter regions. Overall, this will fundamentally
advance our understanding of the links between aberrant RNA processing, R-loop metabolism, and genome
maintenance in the context of disease relevant processes, such as defects in RNA export associated with
intellectual disabilities."
10923932,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The most major and critical barrier to the treatment of obesity and comorbid conditions is weight loss
maintenance. A range of established treatments reliably produce clinically significant initial weight losses of 3-
30% of body weight, which substantially reduce risk and severity of disease, even when the weight loss is
modest. However, weight loss maintenance is uniformly poor, with most patients regaining at least some
weight and behaviorally treated patients returning to baseline weight within 5 years, thereby renewing risk for
weight-related illness. While regain is common, it is difficult to predict when or why an individual will begin to
regain lost weight. We therefore propose an experiment that will enable a future just-in-time adaptive
intervention (JITAI) that passively monitors triggers for lapse, identifies which triggers are most likely to
contribute to lapse for each patient, accurately predicts when a patient is entering a period of heightened risk
for lapse, determines the type(s) of intervention(s) that are likely to prevent the lapse, administers intervention
for as long as needed to reestablish healthy behavioral patterns for weight maintenance, and then returns to
passive monitoring. This automated intervention is nearly within reach via a combination of mobile
technologies, analytics, and behavioral intervention techniques that our team has already established,
including: (a) an Ecological Momentary Assessment platform to measure daily weight and related behavioral
and psychosocial influences; (b) an analytic framework, Control Systems Engineering, capable of modeling
complex patterns of behavioral and psychosocial influences on weight, and determining how best to intervene
on this “system” to facilitate weight loss maintenance; and (c) a toolbox of empirically validated behavioral
intervention strategies known to be effective for addressing common causes of weight regain. This proposal
aims to support our multidisciplinary team in combining our areas of expertise and prior work to enable a
“system identification (ID) experiment” with N=120 participants who have recently lost ≥3% of initial body
weight in a 6-month behavioral obesity treatment (N=180 will undergo behavioral obesity treatment to produce
this sample), who will be studied over a 12-month maintenance period. The data will be used to validate and
refine a theoretical model of weight loss maintenance. During the study, 4 interventions from the behavioral
toolbox will be administered randomly, thus providing necessary data on: (a) how lapse triggers are related to
each other and weight, and (b) which interventions are effective for addressing which triggers, for whom, and
under what circumstances. The end result of this project will be a control systems algorithm that can predict
when, for whom, and how to intervene to prevent weight regain, and a mobile platform that can be used to
deliver JITAI in the next phase of research. This highly innovative approach to weight loss maintenance could
ultimately prevent regain in large numbers of individuals at low cost using smartphone technology that is
already ubiquitous."

Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic infectious disease, with an estimated treatment cost of ~$70
billion/year. While a multifactorial disease, Streptococcus mutans is recognized as a keystone caries pathogen
because of its capacity to modulate the oral biofilm in a way that promotes the establishment of a highly
acidogenic (cariogenic) microbiota. The trace metals iron, manganese, and zinc (Zn) play structural, catalytic,
and regulatory roles in proteins and so are essential to all forms of life. Conversely, these same metals are
toxic when in excess such that the ability to maintain metal homeostasis is a critical aspect of host-pathogen
interactions. The toxicity of Zn derives from its top position in the Irving-Williams series of metal stability, which
allows Zn to avidly bind to non-cognate metalloproteins rendering them nonfunctional. Because it has both
antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties and relatively low toxicity to mammalian cells, Zn has been
used for decades in medicine, including incorporation into oral health products for the treatment of gingivitis,
halitosis, and prevention of calculus formation. Recently, it was discovered that S. mutans is intrinsically and
substantially more tolerant to toxic levels of Zn than all other streptococci and that this high tolerance is
mediated by a unique P-type ATPase exporter that has been named ZccE. Expression of zccE is controlled by
a unique MerR-type regulator, ZccR for zccE regulator, that strongly activates zccE transcription in response to
high Zn stress. Because both ZccE and ZccR are unique to S. mutans, the Lemos lab proposes that both can
be targeted for the development of a Zn-based therapy tailored against S. mutans. While other projects in the
Lemos lab are exploring the antimicrobial potential of ZccE, the specific aims of this application center around
the ZccR regulator. The goals of this application are to determine the structure-function relationships of ZccR
and explore its potential as an antimicrobial target. To accomplish these goals, the PI will (i) use
crystallography and computational-based approaches to determine the structure of ZccR and identify its critical
functional residues, and (ii) utilize the rat model to determine the contribution of ZccR to oral biofilm
colonization and caries development alone or in combination with topical Zn treatment. Knowledge gained from
this study will facilitate the structure-guided design of small molecule inhibitors for ZccR and reveal the
potential of targeting mechanisms of Zn homeostasis to combat S. mutans infections, with the long-term
objective of developing novel therapies for the prevention of dental caries and treatment of systemic S. mutans
infections (i.e., infective endocarditis). This work will be conducted in a highly supportive and collaborative
research environment with Aim 1 establishing a collaboration between the Lemos and McKenna labs.
Moreover, the comprehensive training plan provided will accelerate the PI's academic and scientific growth
through participation in formal course work and workshops, opportunities to learn new methodologies,
mentoring students, establishing new collaborations, and improving scientific writing and presentation skills."

experience persistent disparities in liver disease outcomes in the U.S. This project investigates how these dis-
parities may affect members of the Mount Sinai WTC General Responder Cohort. Currently, the WTC Healthcare
Program (WTCHP) covers liver cancer treatment, but it does not cover the diagnosis and treatment of other liver
diseases or liver cancer surveillance These policies may create holes in the healthcare safety net that could
disproportionately disadvantage African American Responders. Fortunately, WTC monitoring visits provide the
data needed to calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, a well-validated instrument for liver disease screening. We
embedded a FIB-4 calculator in Mount Sinai’s EPIC electronic medical record (EMR). It is available to Mount
Sinai WTCHP providers. In this project, we will introduce the calculator to Mount Sinai WTCHP providers. We
will also analyze for disparities in mortality and study archived specimens to assess for toxins that were present
in the WTC dust cloud. Environmental and workplace exposures to toxins can cause liver injury and cancer and
they synergize with other sources of liver injury to magnify damage and liver cancer risk. The WTC dust cloud
contained tons of debris and hepatotoxins, including particulates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other
persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Adolescents exposed to WTC dust had elevated PCDD/F levels > 12 years
after the attack, establishing that toxins in WTC dust remain detectable for long periods. Our research is expected
to show that WTC exposure caused, aggravated, or contributed to liver disease (criteria for certification).
Aim I: Disparities in mortality. The goal of SubAim1 is to collaborate with the WTCHP General Responder
Data Center to rigorously identify all Mount Sinai WTC General Responders with cirrhosis and/or liver cancer.
The goal of SubAim 2 is to test the hypothesis that among responders with cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, African
American responders have higher all-cause and liver-related mortality than other responders.
Aim II: A FIB-4 calculator to screen for liver disease in Mount Sinai General Responders. The goal of Aim
II is to enable WTCHP providers to screen for liver disease. We will introduce the FIB-4 calculator to Mount Sinai
WTCHP providers at some clinics and not others and test the hypothesis that education increases use of the
calculator. We will also monitor for differences in rates of referral to hepatology between clinics in each arm.
Aim III: WTC toxins in plasma and liver. The goal of SubAim 1 is to test the hypothesis that plasma levels of
PCBs and other POPs are higher in GRC responders than in controls and are directly related to FIB-4 scores
and inversely related to platelet counts. The goal of SubAim 2 is to compare particulates and granulomas be-
tween archived liver specimens of WTC responders and controls matched for liver disease etiology.
Impact: The long-term goals are to provide data to inform CDC/NIOSH decisions about whether liver diseases
meet criteria for WTC certification and to address any disparities that may exist among General Responders."

Adverse events pose a significant challenge to medical interventions (drugs, devices, others) with an estimated
2.3 million cases of adverse drug events between 1969-2002. Adverse events are responsible for longer hospital
stay, higher healthcare costs, and higher mortality. There is a clear need for adverse event surveillance, but the
standards of manual chart review and voluntary reporting are time-consuming and unsustainable. Voluntary
reporting also misses most adverse event cases. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs)
captures medical data for the majority of US patients and presents an opportunity for sustainable adverse event
surveillance via automated strategies. However, there are two barriers to automating adverse event surveillance.
First, adverse events are poorly represented by International Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis
codes. This has inhibited efforts to use simple rules-based code or flag/trigger approaches, while complex and
high-performing text-mining approaches are thwarted by the difficulty of adapting them to other healthcare sites
and large data networks for wider surveillance. Second, temporal information in the EHR inherent to adverse
event timing and sequencing is challenging to capture. The challenges to existing approaches include –
treatment of related medical concepts as independent entities, the rapid explosion of data inhibiting scaling to
large numbers of medical concepts, and human interpretability. Our overarching goal is to expand on existing
biomedical informatics tools to better capture adverse events and more comprehensively represent the
full patient medical trajectory to identify archetypes of adverse event development. We will pilot these
methods for cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. In Specific Aim 1, we will
incorporate medical concept embedding and clustering methods to draw a “map” of disease, segmented into
“neighborhoods” labeled for the conditions they describe, including adverse events. In Specific Aim 2, we will
test a novel method for tracking patient trajectories on a map of disease and hypothesize that we can identify
archetypal patient trajectories that have different clinical outcomes using time-series clustering. This work
addresses gaps in EHR-based phenotyping and adverse event surveillance. It has the potential to inform
risk factor identification, prediction of adverse event development, and prognostication of patient
outcomes, as well as lay a crucial stepping-stone for further progression of EHR-based phenotyping in
biomedical informatics. This fellowship award will enable me to develop my skills in biomedical informatics
methods, integrate clinical perspective into my research, hone my writing and presentation skills, and expand
my professional network. At the conclusion of this award, I will have made strides towards becoming an
independent physician-informaticist, fusing clinical experience and informatics tools to improve patient care."
10896307,"Project Summary/Abstract
 A majority of heritable disease-causing variation resides in the non-coding portions of the human
genome. A leading hypothesis is that most of this variation exerts its effects on cell-type-specific cis-
regulatory sequences (CRSs). Interpreting such variation will therefore require quantitative models of the
‘regulatory grammar’ that controls the cell-type-specific activities of CRSs. We define the regulatory
grammar of a cell type to be the independent and interacting contributions of transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs) to cis-regulatory activity. Models of regulatory grammar must also include the dependencies
of those contributions on the number, orientation, spacing, and affinity of TFBSs. Detailed models of
regulatory grammars are still in their infancy, partly because we lack systematic training data for how CRSs
behave across diverse cell types in vivo. We propose to address this gap by systematically measuring the
activities of CRSs across cell types within intact mammalian tissues. To collect this data, we will introduce
a single-cell massively parallel reporter gene assay (scMPRA) that measures the cell-type-specific
activities of CRSs in vivo. We will model the resulting data using a formal thermodynamic model in which
each TF-DNA or TF-TF interaction is represented by its free energy (ΔG) of interaction. By comparing the
magnitudes of the resulting ΔG values, we will quantify the independent and interacting contributions of
specific TFBSs, thus deriving quantitative regulatory grammars that capture the differences between cell
types within the mammalian retina (Aim 1) and the mammalian brain (Aim 2). By validating our models on
sequence variants of endogenous CRSs, we hope to make progress towards a framework for accurately
predicting the effects of non-coding genetic variation on the function of CRSs."

The lymphatic system is the central regulator of fluid homeostasis in the body through absorbing and returning
interstitial fluid back to blood circulation; additionally, it plays pivotal roles in lipid digestion and immune and
inflammatory response through the lymphoid organs and immune cell trafficking. Studies have documented the
presence of lymphatics in the uterus; however, little consensus exists regarding the exact development and
distribution of the uterine lymphatics nor their impact on uterine health functions. Understanding the proper
development and maintenance of the lymphatics may be of clinical importance, as lymphatics have been
implicated in pathogenesis uterine diseases such as endometriosis and cancer metastasis. In this study, we
propose to elucidate the development and functions of uterine lymphatics using Prox1 fluorescent lymphatic
reporter and lymphatic loss of function mouse models. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that the
uterine lymphatics develop postnatally under patterning guidance from uterine blood vessels, and that uterine
lymphatics remodel to maintain fluid homeostasis of the uterine environment through estrous phases and
pregnancy. After characterizing normal development of the murine uterine lymphatics, we will determine the
function of uterine lymphatics in the context of fluid drainage of the uterine tissue and regulation of embryonic
implantation sites and gestation. The maintenance of fluid homeostasis in the uterus through estrous phases
and pregnancy will be assessed through real-time tracer studies and wet/dry tissue weight ratios, while the role
of uterine lymphatics in embryonic implantation will be dissected through use of novel genetic and surgical
inducible lymphatic loss of function mouse models. Together, these study outcomes will generate a novel
understanding of murine uterine lymphatic morphology and function, which may provide a valuable new
viewpoint from which to assess uterine health."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this grant cycle, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) had an unprecedented opportunity to expand
clinical research to a significant number of additional hospitals of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system.
This unified and organized expansion was enabled by 1) Dr. Libutti’s roles as Cancer Center Director and Senior
VP for Oncology Services of RWJBH; 2) Dr. Hochster’s roles as CINJ Associate Director for Clinical Research
and Director of Oncology Research for RWJBH; and 3) development of a system-wide academic health system
between Rutgers and RWJBH effective 01/01/2019 through a Master Affiliation Agreement.
The CINJ Office of Human Research Services (OHRS) was established to meet the current and future needs of
Cancer Center Members and other stakeholders in the broader university and hospital community. The goal of
this CPDM resource is to enable and enhance clinical and translational research by providing CINJ members
with centralized resources, information, and expertise in clinical research. All oncology research at all hospitals
and sites of RWJBH and RU have been consolidated under the direction and management of the OHRS with
single PRMS oversight. Through comprehensive planning, and in conjunction with Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE), network growth was intentional and strategic to bring clinical trials to underrepresented
populations. In this newly integrated and unified “one-site” model, CPDM has access to unprecedented numbers
of patients for clinical research activities to positively impact catchment area priorities and needs. OHRS serves
as a centralized clinical research administration, housing all administrative tasks at CINJ while providing
oversight and direction for each clinical oncology research operation site throughout RWJBH. OHRS has the
responsibility of working with both Rutgers and system-wide clinical investigators to manage the business,
clinical and regulatory functions of all phases of pediatric and adult oncology cancer clinical trials throughout the
health system. The organizational structure comprises 196 FTEs with ten distinct offices based on specialization
within functional areas such as clinical operations, quality assurance, and regulatory affairs.
OHRS activity increased along with the number of research operation sites, clinical trials, and investigators.
Following a rating of exceptional to outstanding in the last review, OHRS was enhanced by increased staff, full
implementation of OnCore® clinical research management system software (Advarra EDC, eREG, and Insights),
and systems for supporting system-wide clinical trials. These include global access to OnCore®, the use of eREG
application for online access to DOAs, and global use of the Rutgers eIRB system for investigator registration
and compliance. Screening, enrollment, and available clinical trials increased significantly with the integration of
RWJBH sites. Since the last review, open treatment trials more than doubled (214 vs. 92 in 2018) and enrollment
to therapeutic treatment trials increased 80% (561 in the current year of record vs. 311) with a 300% increase in
enrollment from RWJBH sites. Minority enrollment increased from 27.6% in 2017 to 44.4% in 2022."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The PRMS at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) is composed of three components, the Disease
Specific Groups (DSGs), the Scientific Review Board (SRB), and the Human Research Oversight Committee
(HROC). These groups work collaboratively to provide oversight of all aspects of oncology clinical research at
CINJ, across the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. Since January 2019, RWJBH leadership agreed that
all oncology research at any of the system hospitals would be conducted in accordance with our CCSG
processes and under CPDM oversight, as memorialized in a memo executed by Howard S. Hochster, MD, FACP
as Associate Director for Clinical Research and Steven K. Libutti, MD, FACS as Senior Vice President of
Oncology Services. All cancer research throughout the RWJBH system is now reviewed by the SRB and under
the supervision of the CINJ PRMS. Each of the 13 DSGs is responsible for the initial review and prioritization of
interventional trials within its portfolio as well as the ongoing scientific relevance of the trial to the disease area,
regardless of the PI or hospital where the PI practices. DSG review and written approval are required for any
interventional therapeutic trial in order to be reviewed by the SRB. The SRB focuses on scientific merit, scientific
prioritization for CINJ resources, and ongoing scientific progress of the trials. To provide the necessary expertise
in the principal disciplines of oncology, the SRB consists of clinical, basic, and population scientists,
biostatisticians, community outreach engagement specialists, and patient advocates. By agreement with Rutgers
Biomedical Health Sciences (RBHS), the SRB must review all cancer-related clinical protocols before
Institutional Review Board (IRB) review; this provides a centralized mechanism for evaluating the scientific merit
of all cancer clinical trials and prioritizes studies for access to CINJ resources. COE community outreach
specialists review each protocol reviewed by SRB to ensure appropriate representation by gender, race,
ethnicity, and age in each interventional trial, making approval and enhancement recommendations. Patient
advocates review each protocol for advice on patient acceptability. The SRB reviews the CINJ Data and Safety
Monitoring Plan (DSMP) and assigns the level of risk to interventional, investigator-initiated trials (IITs).
The SRB works with HROC, which functions as an independent Data and Safety Monitoring committee
responsible for safety review and accrual/progress monitoring of all CINJ IITs. All DSMP activities fall under the
purview of HROC and are further described in the Clinical Protocol and Data Management section. HROC reports
directly to the Cancer Center Director. HROC shares its findings and recommendations with the SRB in the event
that these are believed by the HROC to be potentially relevant to the scientific integrity of the trial. SRB reviews
these findings and recommendations and has the sole authority to close any trials that are not meeting accrual
or performance standards. Importantly, in the event that the committee is notified of misconduct or other issues,
the SRB will contact all appropriate authorities (e.g., IRB, FDA, NCI, funding sponsor) as needed."

Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are central regulators of the adaptive immune response, and have been
shown to be required for the induction of T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. In particular, a subset of cDCs
(cDC1) is responsible for transporting tumor antigens to the lymph node and cross presenting antigen in order
to activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thereby inducing an anti-tumor response. We have recently observed TIM-
3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing-3) expression on cDCs in human and murine mammary
tumors, and found that TIM-3 blockade improved response to standard-of-care paclitaxel chemotherapy in
models of triple-negative and luminal B disease. This occurred through increased chemokine expression by
cDCs, without a corresponding in T cell infiltration, leading me to hypothesize that the spatial localization of
cDCs and T cells within tumors is a critical determinant of successfully immunotherapy. In the F99 portion of
this application I will therefore seek to determine if TIM-3 blockade alters the spatial organization of T cells, and
if this is responsible for therapeutic efficacy. In the K00 phase of this proposal I will expand these studies to
evaluate whether cDC/T cell clustering is a prerequisite for response to immune checkpoint blockade and other
therapeutic modalities."

and BRD3, NSD3, ZNF532, etc. (the rest 30% of cases). Functionally, knockdown of the BRD4-NUTM1 fusion
gene in human NC cell lines suppresses their proliferation, suggesting a strong dependency on BRD4-NUTM1
by NC. However, because the ectopic expression of BRD4-NUTM1 in non-NC cell lines is unequivocally toxic,
the oncogenic activity of the fusion gene has not been proved previously. Recently, we developed the first
genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of NC by recapitulating the Brd4-Nutm1 forming chromosome
translocation in the basal cells of epithelial tissues. The mouse model developed highly aggressive low
differentiation squamous cell carcinoma, similar to human NCs. Our GEMM study provided the first functional
proof of BRD4-NUTM1 as the oncogenic driver of NC. The high dependency of NC on the BRD4-NUTM1 fusion
gene for both cancer initiation and development presented it as an ideal target for therapy. Moreover, the testis-
specific expression profile would make therapeutic strategies targeting NUTM1 highly specific and with a high
therapeutic index. Because NUTM1 is an adaptor protein that is primarily consisted of low-complexity sequences,
there are no apparent target sites for small molecular inhibitors. New therapeutic modules that target its DNA
(e.g., CRISPR-based gene therapy) and mRNA (antisense therapy) sequences, or the ones that target its protein
by synthetic affinity agents (e.g., nanobody-directed Proteolysis Chimera (PROTAC)) would likely be needed.
Due to the limited conservation in genomic DNA (~3%) and peptide sequence (66%), our NC model based
on the mouse genes is not ideal for developing NUTM1-targeting therapeutics. We propose to humanize
the NC GEMM by replacing the mouse Nutm1 gene component with a human NUTM1 coding sequence (Aim 1)
and characterize the NC tumors generated by this humanized model (Aim 2). We expect this well-characterized
humanized NC GEMM to serve as a valuable preclinical model for developing NUTM1 targeting therapies for
NC.
Overall Impact. This project will produce a humanized GEMM for NC. By allowing the preclinical development
of human NUTM1 targeting therapies, our new model can transform the landscape of NC therapy development
and benefit NC patients. More broadly, the knowledge around targeting NUTM1 that the humanized NC model
will foster can provide critical clues for developing NUTM1 targeting therapies for other NUTM1 rearranged
cancers such as childhood leukemia and sarcoma."
10823313,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Over the past several decades the number of people in the United States with diabetes has steadily increased
and reports from 2020 indicate nearly 10.5% of the population have the disease, leading to more than 270,000
deaths and an estimated cost of $327 billion. While tremendous effort is directed towards managing diabetes,
there is no cure. One promising treatment is islet replacement therapy, addressing a major underlying issue in
both type 1 and type 2 diabetes: dysfunctional and dying β cells. This treatment, however, is not widely
accessible because of a lack of donor material. To overcome this limitation, insulin producing β cells can be
generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro, but despite great strides even the best protocols
are unable to efficiently produce mature β cell populations for transplant. To improve this therapeutic strategy,
it is essential to clarify mechanisms of pancreas development using in vivo models that will allow us to refine β
cell differentiation protocols. Nearly all of the information used to formulate these protocols is derived from
developmental studies in mice, which have provided a roadmap specifying the sequential addition or removal
or signaling factors to promote β cell formation. For example, retinoic acid (RA) is included in early stages of all
β cell differentiation protocols to specify pancreatic progenitors simulating numerous studies conducted in
mice. Despite its importance at the onset of pancreas development, little is known about RA later in mouse or
human pancreagenesis. To address this knowledge gap, we performed studies that identified a novel role for
RA during endocrine progenitor specification where RA represses WNT signaling to promote β cell
differentiation. Since RA clearly does not act alone in this process, I also began to examine the role of GATA
factors during pancreas development as well, since previous work has demonstrated RA-GATA synergy in
several models, including human β cell differentiations. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency of GATA6 in humans
leads to pancreas agenesis in more than 50% of cases, yet this same deletion in mice and human β cell
differentiations results in minor phenotypes, suggesting that background modifiers, like RA signaling, could be
playing a major role. My preliminary studies described in this proposal demonstrate significant synergy
between RA and GATA TFs in mice: simultaneous inhibition leads to drastically fewer and dysfunctional
endocrine cells that contributes to severe physiological defects during development and adulthood. With
guidance from these preliminary data, I will clarify the regulatory mechanisms defining endocrine specification,
β cell development, and islet function by testing the hypothesis that synergy between RA signaling and GATA
transcription factors is essential for embryonic pancreas development and adult islet function."

Training: The major objectives of the proposed K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award are Dr. Ashley Watts’
training in alcohol research and the launching of her career as an independent scientist. As a postdoctoral
research fellow in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri, Dr. Watts is well along
the path to becoming a leading psychopathology researcher. Dr. Watts seeks training and mentoring during the
K99 phase to narrow her focus to alcohol use and alcohol use disorder and gain more training in quantitative
genetics and modeling. Training in AUD will emphasize on AUD nosology; modern models of addiction, including
their key neurobehavioral mechanisms; and individual differences in alcohol consumption. She will attend
conferences related to alcohol use/misuse, behavior genetics, and psychopathology. She will also attend
behavioral and molecular genetics workshops that span from human to animal models, as well as a neuroscience
workshop; each of these workshops provides hands-on training in quantitative genetic techniques. This training
will greatly extend Dr. Watts’ foundational knowledge and skill set. Dr. Watts will dedicate a great deal of her
time to the dissemination of findings from the proposed research through manuscript preparation and
submission. The proposed mentor and co-mentor (Drs. Kenneth Sher and Andrew Heath), collaborators (Drs.
Wendy Slutske, Douglas Steinley, and Phillip Wood), and consultants (Drs. John Crabbe, Arpana Agrawal,
Kathleen Bucholz, Kristina Jackson, and David Watson) collectively provide expertise that is ideally suited to
facilitate the successful completion of the proposed training and research activities. Furthermore, the University
of Missouri is a world-class research institution with the resources necessary to facilitate successful completion
of the training (K99) phase of the proposed project.
K99 Phase: With supervision, Dr. Watts will conduct secondary data analysis on phenotypic and genetic
heterogeneity within AUD. This work will be achieved using a combination of large-scale cross-sectional and
longitudinal phenotypic and genetically informative data. She will receive training via mentorship, coursework,
workshops, readings, and consultation.
R00 Phase: Dr. Watts will ascertain features of AUD that are specific to alcohol use, rather than general to
substance use, externalizing psychopathology, or psychopathology more broadly using phenotypic, behavior
genetic, and molecular genetic analysis.
Significance: Her work will ultimately target sources of heterogeneity within AUD, characterize specific AUD
vulnerabilities, and inform future precision-medicine efforts, each of which are emphasized by NIAAA’s
emphases on the improvement of AUD diagnosis and understanding its relations with other forms of
psychopathology (NIAAA, 2017)."
10780892,"Project Summary
Covert cerebrovascular disease (CCD), comprising covert brain infarction (CBI) and white matter disease
(WMD), is commonly found incidentally on neuroimaging scans obtained in routine clinical care. CBI is
believed to be pathophysiologically similar to clinically-evident stroke, but with infarct locations in clinically less
articulate parts of the brain. Epidemiologic studies based on MRI-screened cohorts indicate that CBI is far
more common than clinically-evident stroke, and WMD is even more common. Both types of CCD are strong,
independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. The American Heart Association/American Stroke
Association has identified CCD as a major priority for new studies on stroke prevention. Identifying high-risk
individuals prior to the onset of severe cognitive decline is a central goal in dementia prevention research.
However, application of insights from studies of MRI-screened cohorts to patients with incidentally-discovered
CCD is not straightforward. Patients are not screened but are selected for clinically-indicated neuroimaging;
real-world imaging is dominated by CT scans; neuroimaging interpretation and reporting are heterogeneous
and poorly standardized. Additionally, there are no ICD-9 codes for CBI or WMD, which also do not generally
appear in a patient’s problem list or in structured fields of electronic health records. Indeed, both patients and
their providers are often unaware of these findings even after they are detected. Our team has performed the
first large-scale study of the prevalence and prognostic importance of incidentally-discovered (id)-CCD using
natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and created a real-world cohort comprising approximately
250,000 stroke- and dementia-free patients over age 50 who received either head CT or MRI, approximately
30% of whom have id-CCD. These NLP-identified id-CBI and id-WMD are both strong predictors of future
clinically-evident stroke and dementia. While this cohort has yielded important insights, there are substantial
limitations. Extractable information on WMD severity is frequently missing. Even when present in text reports,
only relatively crude information on WMD burden can be obtained. Further, other evidence of CCD—including
microbleeds, microinfarcts, prominent perivascular spaces—may also be prognostically important. Finally,
direct image analysis may discover new radiomic biomarkers predictive of future stroke and dementia that are
not captured or unknown. The ambitious goal of this project is to develop a clinically useful algorithm that can
directly read routinely obtained neuroimaging scans at scale and relate findings to stroke and dementia
outcomes through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a deep learning model to identify and
characterize covert id-CCD from routinely obtained CT and MRI neuroimages and use these features, and
other deep radiomic biomarkers, to predict the development of future stroke and dementia. Aim 2: Test the
deep learning algorithms developed in Aim 1 on a large cohort of patients from an integrated health system for
the prediction of future stroke and dementia to evaluate their incremental prognostic value."

10771105,"REVISED ABSTRACT
Replication initiation in eukaryotes is believed to be dependent on a six subunit, ATP-dependent complex of proteins, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), which loads the helicase MCM2-7 at origins of replication. In the last cycle of this grant we made the surprising discovery that several human cancer cell lines continue to proliferate and replicate their DNA in the absence of two important subunits of ORC, ORC1 or ORC2. This proposal will test whether cancer cell-lines survive through the action of a crippled ORC (ORC missing one subunit), or because cell transformation activates an alternate helicase-loading mechanism that allows MCM2-7 loading in the absence of the six subunit ORC. The proposal will also identify how human ORC activates and represses the compactness of the chromatin and thus regulate gene expression. It will test whether the individual subunits of ORC have functions in this regard only as the complex ORC or as individual proteins independent of the holo-ORC. The results will delineate the importance of ORC in replication initiation and maintenance of genome stability in cancer cells, identify ORC-bypass mechanisms and identify replication-independent functions of ORC in regulating cell physiology."
10771163,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a multifunctional non-receptor tyrosine kinase and scaffolding protein that is
overexpressed in numerous solid tumors including melanoma, while minimally expressed in normal tissue. FAK
has been widely investigated as a cancer drug target due its contribution in multiple aspects of tumor progression,
including adhesion, invasion, proliferation, survival, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune cell suppression.
However, development of FAK inhibitors has largely focused on inhibition of the kinase enzyme of FAK opposed
to inhibition of key scaffolding interactions. Particularly, limited efforts have been made at the discovery and
biological evaluation of inhibitors of the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) scaffolding domain of FAK, the domain
required for FAK localization to focal adhesions. During this period of support, we have identified the first
discovered stapled peptide-based FAK inhibitor (UA-1907) that binds to and co-crystallizes with the FAT domain,
and competitively inhibits FAK-paxillin binding. We have identified a myristoylated derivative (UA-2012) with
improved cellular potency, favorable drug-like properties, and in vivo efficacy; and developed a bivalent peptide
(UA-2023) with low nanomolar binding to FAT. However, the mechanistic differences between these novel FAT
domain peptides and traditional FAK-kinase inhibitors on perturbation of focal adhesion complexes and the FAK
interactome have yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, we have preliminary data showing that FAT inhibition
provides selective anti-cancer effects in NRAS mutant melanoma cells. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin
cancer and there are no current effective targeted therapies against NRAS mutant melanoma, which represents
~30% of all patients. We hypothesize that FAK FAT domain inhibitors have distinct biological effects on
the focal adhesion complex in cancer cells compared to FAK kinase inhibitors; and cancer cells with
alterations in NRAS signaling pathways have a molecular dependence on FAK FAT scaffolding for
survival, thus promoting selective anti-cancer efficacy. In specific aim 1, we will identify the unique
differences between FAK FAT scaffold inhibitors and FAK kinase inhibitors on modulation of the focal adhesion
complex and the FAK interactome. In specific aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanisms of
sensitivity/resistance to FAK FAT inhibition in melanoma cells with activating mutations in NRAS and BRAF
pathways. In specific aim 3, we will evaluate in vivo efficacy of novel FAK FAT domain inhibitors in mouse models
of NRAS and BRAF driven cancer. Overall, in this project we will utilize FAT stapled peptides to validate that
FAT domain targeting provides additional biological efficacy on the focal adhesion complex compared to FAK-
kinase inhibitors and that NRAS mutant melanoma has a unique sensitivity to FAK FAT inhibition.

The goals of the parent Program Project are to investigate possible mechanistic determinants of reduced
estradiol efficacy on female cognitive aging under pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and
obesity. In order to assess mechanisms by which estradiol’s switch from beneficial for cognitive function to
neutral or even detrimental may occur, the projects in this proposal will investigate cognitive function in aging
female rodents under varying conditions of cardiometabolic health and disease both with and without estradiol
treatment. Core C (Hormones & Behavior Core) will facilitate this work and contribute to the success of the
overall Program Project through the completion of two specific aims. Aim 1 will establish a rodent model of
menopause and hormone therapy that is uniform across all four projects, and Aim 2 will enhance rigor and
reproducibility by standardizing the behavioral tests and assessments used across studies. Core services within
a program project are advantageous compared to independent investigations as they allow for careful planning
and coordination of research design, disease models, and data collection and analysis among all projects which
would otherwise prove difficult for researchers with separate grants at separate institutions. This coordination
will significantly impact the scope of the research by eliminating project-specific variability in biological age,
timelines, dietary components, and disease models and thus permitting inferences between studies that could
otherwise never be made."

This Center brings together a truly diverse team of biomedical, chemical/combustion engineers and physicists,
and non-technical researchers and support staff to conduct interdisciplinary research examining the
environmental and health impacts of pollutant particle systems formed during thermal treatment of hazardous
wastes. The driving scientific concept and innovation of this Center focuses on these environmentally
persistent free radicals (EPFRs). Our team is comprised of experts from Louisiana State University (LSU), LSU
Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, LSU School of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University,
Dominican University of California, and University of Queensland, Australia. All participating institutions have
invested in the success of the Center and have agreed to offer significant additional support, which will be used
to provide flexibility for our Center to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities, pursue high-
risk/high-impact and transformative research, and attract new faculty/researchers as participants. The
Administrative Core (AC) will monitor, prioritize, allocate, and manage resources across these sites. This
includes fostering efficient collaboration, data and information sharing, the rapid dissemination of resources,
evaluation and management of programmatic performance, and the identification and resolution of problems.
Innovations include meetings structured to disseminate information across Project and Cores to stakeholders,
leveraging of state-of-the-art institutional resources (e.g., LSU’s Center for Advanced Microstructures &
Devices and Materials Characterization Laboratory; LSUHSC’s Statistical Analysis Core; LSUSVM’s Inhalation
Research Facility) and development of a web portal (managed by the DMAC and AC) for archiving, sharing
and analysis of all data generated by the Center. The integration of Research Translation (RT) into the Core
creates opportunities for even greater cross-Center collaboration and bidirectional RT. The RT component of
the Core will work with the Research Experience and Training Coordination Core and Project and Core
Leaders to involve trainees in community engagement activities and provide professional development
workshops on concepts related to environmental health science and Center research. The RT component will
establish new and strengthen existing community, industry, governmental, and SRP partnerships by inviting
partners to participate in Center activities, such as the annual Dellinger Symposium. Finally, LSU’s Office of
Research & Economic Development has created a supportive environment for multidisciplinary research
initiatives such as our Center offering centralized officers for compliance (IRB, IACUC, etc.), facilitating
/organizing scientific reviewers for the application, and assisting with the editing and compilation of this

10772185,"Project Summary/Abstract: Community Engagement Core (CEC)
Roughly 53 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund remediation site. Research on environmental
contaminants from these sites indicates that environmentally persistent free radical (EPFR) concentrations
range to an order of magnitude in concentration above those in surrounding uncontaminated areas. These
EPFRs have been shown to form during thermal treatment (TT) of Superfund sites and other hazardous
wastes. Our data demonstrate that EPFRs adversely impact cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic health.
The overall goal of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to build an innovative and responsive,
bidirectional community engagement program to develop solutions to reduce exposure and enhance the health
and safety of communities near Superfund sites and other sites where hazardous materials undergo TT. The
CEC directly addresses SRP Mandate #4 (i.e., methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous
substances). In addition to a new environmental health literacy project, we have designed the LSU Clean Air
Research Engagement for Superfund Communities (LaCARES). We will work with two communities: Colfax,
LA, home to a TT facility for Superfund and other hazardous wastes, and the Superfund community of Alsen,
LA where TT of hazardous wastes was conducted. Residents of these communities also face environmental
justice (EJ) challenges. We will develop a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) program in close
collaboration with Projects 3 and 4. The CEC, SRP researchers, and trainees will work to increase
understanding of EPFRs and develop prevention/intervention strategies in partnership with the communities.
We will develop a new interactive air-quality website and mobile phone app (LouiSA—Louisiana State
University Superfund Research Center Air Quality). Through this app, residents will be able to record, upload,
and share their observations concerning air quality, odors, and physical symptoms that they experience. The
residents’ observations will be reported by the app, which will eventually incorporate measurements from the
monitors deployed in Project 3. The community-based monitoring (consisting of input from residents about
where to deploy air monitors and uploading of results and individual observations of air quality) will serve to
validate smaller, inexpensive monitoring kits being developed by Project 4 to be deployed by the residents
through the CEC. We will work collaboratively with residents to identify actions they may take that mitigate
exposure risks, such as limiting outdoor activities, running air conditioners, and including more antioxidant
nutrients in their diets. Finally, the CEC will help residents prepare comments for meetings with regulators so
that they may participate more effectively in collective decisions about the treatment of hazardous materials in
their communities. These collaborative activities—selecting locations to be monitored, recording observations,
and selecting mitigation strategies—will help enhance the health resilience of these communities, and could be
applied to other EJ localities."

and becomes hyper-phosphorylated alongside increased activation of the kinases. The hyper-

thought to impede Aβ and tau clearance. Cytosolic Lyn kinase, a close homologue of Fyn kinase, is

GSK3β kinases, each also involved in Alzheimer’s. The features of the Eph-CRMP and Eph-Lyn
interacting interfaces need to be characterized, as they will be potential biomarkers and targets for
therapeutic intervention. The proposal has two main aims. Aim 1) seeks to establish the in vitro
phosphorylation patters of various kinases on the intracellular domains of EphA4 and –B2 in the
presence and absence of CRMP and to further validate the formation of the complex in cells. Aim 2) The
effect that the corresponding phosphomimetic/phospho-defective mutations have on the level of activity
on these Eph receptor intracellular regions and of the kinases will be studied with purified proteins in

10770842,"Project Summary
Migraine, a chronic intermittent headache disorder, ranks in the top five causes for years lived with disability. Approximately 15% of the US population experiences migraine, with women afflicted approximately twice as often as men. Although pharmacologic medications are often used as first-line treatments for migraine, these treatments may have difficult side effects and may increase the risk for migraine chronification. As a result, individuals with migraine often turn to other treatment modalities, including the use of natural products and dietary supplements, for long-term migraine management. 
Preliminary evidence from the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) suggests a cocoa extract supplement may have beneficial effects on migraine. COSMOS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing a cocoa extract supplement containing 500 mg cocoa flavanols/d (including 80 mg (-)-epicatechin, plus 15 mg caffeine and 50 mg theobromine) for the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 21,442 older adults. Every six months, participants were asked about the occurrence of adverse events, including migraine. Individuals randomized to the cocoa extract supplement were significantly less likely to report migraine (hazard ratio (HR)=0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78, 0.93) than those assigned to placebo. 
However, several important gaps in knowledge remain. First, COSMOS enrolled only older adults but the prevalence and disability burden of migraine is highest at younger ages (i.e. 15-49 years) and it is unknown if cocoa extract is effective in a younger population. Second, COSMOS did not collect detailed information on changes in migraine frequency, as recommended by current guidelines for trials of migraine treatments. Finally, an animal study suggested a potential dose-response relationship between cocoa consumption and migraine pathophysiology, highlighting the importance of considering higher amounts of cocoa extract and bioactive content in future human studies. 
Our long-term goal is to conduct a fully powered trial evaluating the effectiveness of a cocoa extract supplement on reducing the frequency of migraine attacks. As a first step, we propose to conduct a three-arm pilot study. We will recruit and randomize (1:1:1 allocation ratio) 114 adults with episodic migraine to receive one of the following treatments for 12 weeks: 1) 1000 mg of cocoa extract (including 160 mg/d (-)-epicatechin, 100 mg theobromine, and 30 mg caffeine); 2) 500 mg of cocoa extract (including 80 mg/d (-)-epicatechin, 50 mg theobromine, and 15 mg caffeine); or 3) placebo. Our proposed pilot study will allow us to address the following aims: 1) to assess the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and adherence; 2) to determine the acceptability of higher doses of cocoa extract supplement to this patient population; 3) to optimize data collection and data management and establish the infrastructure needed for a large-scale trial."

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaborative research
resource established to systematically evaluate long-term outcomes among children diagnosed with cancer who
survived five or more years from diagnosis. With the successful recruitment and longitudinal follow-up of the
cohort that includes survivors diagnosed and treated over three decades (1970-1999), the CCSS is the world's
largest established open resource for survivorship research with 38,036 eligible survivors available for
investigation of late mortality, and 25,665 participants who have contributed health-related and quality of life
outcomes. The resource includes comprehensive annotation of treatment exposures, ongoing longitudinal
follow-up and an established biorepository from which genotype (SNP array) and DNA sequencing of 8,380
survivors are available to investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment-
related late effects. Extensive use by the research community has resulted in: 381 published or in press
manuscripts now cited over 26,500 times; 347 presented abstracts; 59 investigator-initiated grants funded,
totaling $67 million in funding; utilization by a diverse group of 1,225 investigators including 91 early career
trainees; conduct of 11 randomized trials; increased knowledge to inform exposure-based clinical care
guidelines; and a highly successful model for multiple national and international collaborative initiatives of
pediatric cancer survivorship research. During the next five years, activities will ensure the functioning of CCSS
as a strong and productive resource by maintaining, enhancing and promoting its use. We will expand the
collection of data to evaluate physiologic and neurocognitive function with aging, characterize accelerated aging,
and investigate underlying pathophysiology of aging of survivors as they enter into their fourth, fifth and sixth
decades of life. To develop a population resource for intervention trials targeting age-related outcomes, in-home
functional performance assessment and specimen collection will be performed in a sub-cohort of 1000 survivors.
Further, we will enhance the CCSS resource by facilitating the conduct of health services research through
collection of data to evaluate patient, provider, and health care system factors and their associations with access,
quality, and cost of care. To maximize the research community's access and use of the CCSS resource, we will
leverage a cloud-based data sharing platform and develop a data analysis ecosystem with tools for data access,
visualization and analysis of genetic, treatment and phenotypic/outcome data. In the future, assessment of late
outcomes of novel therapies (immunotherapy, targeted/biologic, proton beam radiation) will be essential.
Therefore, with NCI oversight, CCSS will formulate a comprehensive plan for future expansion. These initiatives
will enhance and promote CCSS to further achieve the overarching goal of the CCSS resource to increase the
conduct of innovative and high impact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship."

Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive tumor arising in soft tissue and bone of children and young
adults. EWS is treated with a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy, local radiation, and/or surgery.
Patients with localized disease show a favorable overall survival rate. However, there is still a pressing
need for new therapeutic approaches for EWS. Patients with metastatic or recurrent EWS have a very
poor prognosis. Moreover, current EWS treatments are associated with many short- and long-term
sequelae, e.g. accelerated cardiovascular disease and secondary cancers. EWS-FLI1 is the fusion
oncoprotein present in most cases of EWS. It functions as a pioneer transcription factor to affect
expression of many target genes. The aberrant EWS transcriptome represents a potential therapeutic
target in EWS. This proposal focuses on the sirtuin SIRT5 as a novel therapeutic target in EWS. SIRT5
is found throughout the cell, and regulates protein targets in diverse pathways by removing negatively
charged modifications on lysine residues, including succinylation. Although normal cell types and whole
mice tolerate loss of SIRT5 with minimal phenotypes, we have found that specific cancers, notably
including EWS, are exquisitely dependent on SIRT5, and rapidly undergo apoptosis following SIRT5
depletion. We have linked this effect to a role for SIRT5 in desuccinylating nuclear histones, thereby
modulating gene expression in EWS. We and others have shown that SIRT5 is in principle amenable to
selective inhibition or degradation with small molecules. Our long-term goal is to evaluate SIRT5 as a
potential therapeutic target for EWS. The objective of this proposal is to generate new biological insights
into SIRT5 function in EWS, and characterize SIRT5 inhibitors and SIRT5 PROTAC-based degraders.
The central hypotheses of this application are that: 1) SIRT5 is required for EWS cell survival via histone
desuccinylation and regulation of gene expression; and 2) SIRT5 inhibitors and degraders will represent
useful tool compounds to interrogate SIRT5 biology, and a starting point for potential future EWS
therapeutics. The rationale for this application is that EWS cells show exquisite vulnerability to SIRT5
loss-of-function, while other cell types and whole mice show no major ill effects. Hence, SIRT5 inhibition
would likely be well tolerated clinically. The work will take place in the context of two Specific Aims. First,
we will elucidate the impact of SIRT5 and Ksucc on histones and gene expression, using mass
spectrometry along with transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches. Second, we will optimize and
validate SIRT5 inhibitors and degraders, using medicinal chemistry approaches and based in part on
SIRT5-inhibitor co-crystal structures. The application is innovative, in that no published data currently
link SIRT5 to EWS, and no potent and selective SIRT5 inhibitors or PROTACs have as yet been
described. The work is significant, since there is an unmet clinical need for improved therapies for EWS."

SPLAT BAC Plus is a unique controlled-release larvicide designed to suppress populations of multiple species of
mosquitoes, such as those that transmit malaria, dengue, and West Nile virus (WNV). This CRP proposal seeks
to establish SPLAT BAC Plus as an effective, economically viable control strategy for use in integrated vector
management (IVM) programs and for control of nuisance mosquitoes around the globe. SPLAT BAC Plus has
several advantages over previous larvicides: 1) It contains a combination of larvicidal agents with different modes
of action: Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), B. sphaericus (Bsp) [recently renamed Lysinibacillus
sphaericus]—two bacteria that destroy the gut of mosquitoes that ingest them—and an insect growth regulator
(IGR), such as methoprene or pyriproxyfen, that prevents larvae from developing into adults. This combination
drastically reduces the risk of resistance compared to single-action larvicides. While there are products on the
market combining Bti and Bsp, the inclusion of an IGR in SPLAT BAC Plus will further inhibit the development
of resistance and greatly extend the field life of the larvicide. 2) SPLAT BAC Plus includes components that
promote larval attraction and feeding on the formulation—intensifying their exposure to the Bti, Bsp, and IGR
contained within it—and oviposition attractants (attractants for egg-laying females). As point sources of SPLAT
BAC Plus float at the surface of treated water, these attractants are released into the air, enticing female
mosquitoes to lay their eggs preferentially at that site. 3) SPLAT BAC Plus can be applied to potential larval
habitats under dry conditions ahead of rainfall, a major advantage over most larvicides, which must be applied
shortly after these sites fill with water to catch mosquito larvae at a susceptible stage. 4) Following application,
SPLAT BAC Plus cures and becomes rainfast, becoming activated when the surfaces are submerged for a few
days, detaching and floating to the water's surface and releasing its attractants. After this point, SPLAT BAC Plus
remains buoyant and effective for up to 5 months, considerably longer than the 1–2 week-field life associated
with older Bti/Bsp larvicides. 5) SPLAT BAC Plus contains environmentally safe larvicides and semiochemical
attractants incorporated in an inert matrix composed of food-safe ingredients. To achieve global
commercialization of SPLAT BAC Plus, ISCA Technologies intends to pursue the following Specific Aims: 1)
Obtain the required regulatory approvals to begin sales of SPLAT BAC Plus in the US and begin penetration of
target international markets (e.g., Brazil, Tanzania); 2) Foster consumer support and buy-in via demonstration
trials of SPLAT BAC Plus with targeted distributors of mosquito control products, pest control operators (PCOs),
and mosquito control districts; and 3) Utilize SPLAT BAC Plus to launch a more diversified product line of
mosquito control technologies, designed to conform to the different needs of various mosquito control groups
and consumers, such as varying target species, environmental and safety concerns, and difficulties with
resistance to different control agents."

This project aims to develop the 2P-ActivityScope™, a revolutionary new microscope based on a technological
breakthrough called second-generation Scanned Line Angular Projection (SLAP2) two photon laser scanning
microscopy that was recently developed by Dr. Kaspar Podgorski (Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA). The game-changing innovation in the 2P-ActivityScope is the ability to perform
unparalleled (i) optical imaging of neuronal activity in populations of neurons at subcellular spatial resolution and
temporal resolution in the millisecond range both in vivo and in vitro using a variety of fluorescent indicators (e.g.
voltage, [neurotransmitter]) as well as (ii) high-resolution volumetric calcium imaging of columns of cortical
neurons at 40 Hz in vivo. These capabilities are crucial for ultimately decoding how information is represented
and processed by the billions of densely interconnected neurons comprising the mammalian central nervous
system. Neither contemporary 2-photon microscopes, functional magnetic resonance imaging, inserting
electrodes into the brain, or fiber photometry can serve this need. This project will disseminate and improve upon
the original, lab-built SLAP2 invention to create a commercial product for this important new technology. Based
on pilot work performed at Janelia, it is clear that the 2P-ActivityScope will make a significant impact on the field
of neuroscience research, including advancing studies focused on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with
neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an
improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In
Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype hardware and software;
work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of the 2P-ActivityScope for commercial release. We
will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of the 2P-ActivityScope in close
collaboration with Dr. Podgorski and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not
commercially available."
10778187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cognitive control is an umbrella term that describes processes that regulate cognitive, perceptual, and
motor functions needed to perform adaptive, goal-directed behaviors. Patients with neurological and psychiatric
disorders, for example schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), traumatic brain injury and
stroke, suffer from impairments in cognitive control. Although the function of frontoparietal and striatal circuits in
cognitive control have been extensively studied, increasing evidence suggests a role for the thalamus. Thalamic
nuclei have reciprocal and non-reciprocal connections with multiple cortical regions, integrate modulatory inputs
from other subcortical structures, and innervate both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. Despite this
prominent connectivity profile, the role of the human thalamus in cognitive control and effects of its dysfunction
are not well understood. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the cognitive control functions
of the human thalamus. Our central hypothesis, based on our extensive preliminary data and anatomical
properties of thalamocortical circuits in animal models, is that thalamic nuclei support cognitive control by
modulating cortical activities that include evoked responses, cortical network interactions, and neural oscillations.
These cortical activities instantiate neurocognitive processes that select or maintain task-relevant information,
and they can be selectively amplified through targeted increases in thalamocortical interactions. Consequently,
thalamocortical dysfunction can lead to cognitive rigidity, increased distraction, and poor planning. To test our
hypothesis, we propose a novel approach that integrates cognitive behavioral tasks that specifically manipulate
processes that select and maintain task-relevant information (for example, working memory and set switching),
multimodal neuroimaging (fMRI and EEG), and human thalamic lesions studies. We will first determine the
functional organization (topography) of thalamocortical functional connectivity for cognitive control (Aim 1), which
has not yet been systematically mapped in humans. We will then determine how thalamocortical interactions
select and maintain task-relevant information by examining its relationship with, and modulatory effects on, task-
related cortical activities (Aims 2 and 3). For all studies, we will recruit healthy individuals, patients with focal
thalamic lesions, and control patients from a lesion comparison group. By collecting multimodal neuroimaging
data from patients with focal thalamic lesions, we will determine how the disruption of thalamocortical interactions
affects task-related cortical neural activities and behavior. Results from our proposed research will establish how
the distribution of thalamocortical connectivity enables thalamic nuclei to participate in multiple cognitive control
functions, and specify the cognitive and neural repercussions of thalamocortical dysfunction observed in patients
with thalamic stroke, as well as other disorders such as ADHD and schizophrenia."

 Rapid and sensitive point of care tests that can detect all forms of drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB) are
urgently needed to address the rise of drug resistance. We propose to develop a novel mutation detection system
that uses recently developed nanoreactor bead chemistry and the Blink Diagnostic’s testing platform to identify
both the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and all of the clinically important mutations associated
with isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), pyrazinamide (PZA), fluoroquinolone (FQ), linezolid (L),
bedaquiline (B), and pretomanid/delamanid (Pa/De) resistance. The new system will include integrated sample
processing and rapid thermal cycling technologies to produce results within 30 minutes at the point of care.
Mutations will be detected using digital and real-time PCR in novel addressable nanoreactor beads followed by
melting temperature analysis enabling robust detection of hundreds of different resistance mutations with the
sensitivity of current molecular diagnostics and the quantitation and hetero-resistance detection capacity of
digital PCR. This proposal will build upon an established partnership between Blink scientists and engineers who
previously developed highly successfully instruments and assays at Alere (currently Abbott Rapid Diagnostics),
and the academic team responsible for the suite of Xpert TB assays previously developed in collaboration with
Cepheid to perform the following specific aims: 1. Develop mis-match tolerant or “sloppy” molecular beacons
(SMBs) that identify mutations associated with INH, RIF, EMB and FQ resistance that are optimized to nanobead
format and fully functional on the Blink platform. 2. Finalize a SMB assay that queries the entire Mtb pncA gene
to identify mutations causal of PZA resistance specifically adapted for nanobead format in the BLINK system. 3.
Finalize development of cartridge based mechanical nucleic acid extraction process from sputum and other
matrixes for Mtb. 4. Expand the nanobead assay to test for all clinically relevant mutations causing with
resistance to Pa, B and L using the principals and chemistries developed in aims 1 – 2. 5. Perform initial
laboratory and clinical validation studies of the final aim 1-4 assays using stored clinical samples."
10779886,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Most mortality-causing diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s disease and its related dementias
(ADRDs), cancer, and heart disease, are exacerbated by aberrant mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial
dysfunction is one of the earliest known features of ADRDs such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
Yet its multivariate roles in causing the molecular chain of events that lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive
decline remain unknown. Increasing evidence demonstrates there is significant commonality and overlap in the
pathophysiology of mitochondrial failure in aging-related disorders and mitochondrial disease using a leading
mammalian model missing the electron transport chain protein NDUFS4. These mice exhibit severe
neurodegeneration, weight loss, and premature death. Decreased activity of the electron transport chain, which
is similarly observed in ADRD patients, is hypothesized to promote the build-up of oxygen in the brain causing
oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death. Chronically housing these mitochondrial disease
mice at reduced oxygen concentrations remarkably extends lifespan 10-fold, prevents loss of weight and body
fat, prevents astrogliosis, microglial activation, neuroinflammation, brain lesions, and the disease phenotypes.
 Follow-up experiments indicate NDUFS4-KO mice have ~3-fold increases in tau phosphorylation at
known pathogenic sites and hippocampal tau aggregation. Tau is a microtubule binding protein that stabilizes its
assembly for proper physiology, however, excess tau phosphorylation destabilizes microtubules and forms
proteotoxic aggregates that are common features of tau pathology. Housing mitochondrial disease mice in low
O2 chambers prevents aberrant tau, Gsk3β, and TTBK2 phosphorylation amongst other changes. This data
clearly reveals that mitochondrial dysfunction elicits tau hyperphosphorylation, and suggests aberrant O2 status
may be a driving factor. Furthermore, hypoxic regimens prevent tau hyperphosphorylation and double lifespan
in transgenic nematodes expressing human tau. The proposed work will provide critical insights into the
mechanistic underpinnings of oxygen-induced tau hyperphosphorylation caused by mitochondrial dysfunction
taking a hypothesis driven approach based on preliminary data and literature precedent. It will characterize tau
pathology and illuminate the role of tau kinase Gsk3β in mitochondrial disease. It will also probe changes in
interorganellar communication caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and O2-induced toxicity via NADPH
oxidases. Finally, this proposal will explore the influence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxygen toxicity in well-
established mammalian tauopathies, and the capacity for low oxygen interventions to prevent the onset of tau
pathology. Collectively, these complementary hypothesis-driven basic science studies will provide a better
understanding of mitochondrial biology and illuminate the mechanistic role of signaling pathways in regulating
tau phosphorylation in mitochondrial disease. The achievement of these aims may even have broader
implications in the prevention of other diseases of normative aging such as ADRDs, heart disease, and cancer."

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed in record time and are now widely used in many different
countries around the globe. Project 1 will focus on characterizing immune signatures associated with
SARS-CoV-2 immunization using different vaccine types. In Aim 1 we will leverage existing
biospecimen collected before and after vaccination with mRNA-based or adenoviral vector-based
vaccines to investigate the durability and breadth of vaccine-induced antibody responses and to
determine how early innate immune profiles influence humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immunity
following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In Aim 2 we will characterize the immune responses specific for
break-through infections, despite vaccination with in-depth cellular characterization of selected cases
experiencing severe COVID-19. In Aim 3 we will also determine the immune responses in vaccinated
individuals who get infected and in individuals experiencing vaccine-associated side effects and
reactogenicity. Lastly, in Aim 4, the observations made in human cohorts will be validated in the human
primary tonsillar explant model system, by treating these histocultures (HC) ex vivo with the different
vaccine types, which will allow us to identify the cells that take up the vaccine preparations as well as
those critical for mounting efficient immune defenses. For all these studies, specimens will be facilitated
by the Clinical Core and with the assistance of the Immune Phenotyping Core and the Genomics
Core, all data generated will be analyzed by the Data Management and Dissemination Core.
Integrated analyses of data from different types of specimens using different techniques will be also
performed by the Data Management and Analysis Core, which will identify unique signatures for each
vaccine platform. Collectively, these studies will contribute to defining the biological correlates of
vaccine induced immune protection in the context of SARS-CoV-2 immunization."
10783230,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As COVID-19 has illustrated, the emergence of novel RNA viruses from wild animals poses a significant threat
to human health. In this proposal, we will begin to assess the zoonotic potential of an entire family of viruses:
the arteriviruses. The arteriviruses are the only mammalian RNA virus family not known to infect humans; as
such they have been largely ignored by the biomedical research community. However, these viruses cause
severe disease in many other mammals including monkeys. Due to historical neglect, the research community
has not developed the resources and knowledge that would be required to rapidly develop medical
countermeasures in the event of an arterivirus emergence in humans. Thus, these viruses are uniquely
positioned in our pandemic preparedness blindspot. In this project we will characterize the zoonotic risk posed
by arteriviruses using a diverse collection of arteriviruses and variety of host tools. In Aim 1, we will build upon
our recent discoveries that identified CD163 as a host molecule required for arterivirus entry into cells. We will
create a panel of cells expressing CD163 orthologs from various species (human, monkey, mouse, pig) and
examine the susceptibility of these cells to a panel of arteriviruses. Next, we will create CD163 molecules with
mutations and deletions to map the key domains and residues required for arterivirus binding. Finally, we will
use our knowledge of CD163 to try and grow novel arterivirus isolates that so far cannot be grown in culture. In
Aim 2, we will build upon our recent discovery that the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required for arterivirus
infection of cells. We hypothesize that FcRn acts as an attachment factor, allowing the virus to adhere to the
cell surface and become internalized in the endosomal compartment where it contacts CD163. To test this, we
will perform a series of binding and internalization assays (in the presence and absence of CD163) to establish
a role of FcRn as a pan-arterivirus attachment factor. We will also overexpress CD163 and FcRn in the
background of FcRn- and CD163-knockout cells to determine if these molecules are each required in
sequential fashion or are redundant for arterivirus infection. Finally, we will perform a pair-wise species
comparison of FcRn orthologs and divergent arteriviruses to examine whether FcRn acts as a barrier to
cross-species infection. Upon conclusion of this project we will have a greater appreciation for the zoonotic risk
posed by these viruses. We will also have developed tools, biological systems, and knowledge that will serve
as a critical resource for the rapid development of life-saving medical countermeasures in the event of an
arterivirus outbreak in humans."
10788466,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Drug screening in toxicology cases is performed mainly using immunoassays, gas-
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS). Immunoassays lack the sensitivity, multiplexing capability, and flexibility to respond
to the rise of potent synthetic drugs including fentanyl analogs and synthetic cannabinoids. GC-
MS requires extensive sample preparation including derivatization reactions to achieve adequate
performance. LC-MS, despite being a mature technology, is still not used by most labs for drug
screening due to is high cost and complexity. We therefore see a both a technical and market need
for better drug screening technologies that combine the simplicity and automation of
immunoassays with the high sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry. In this Fast-Track
(combined phase I and phase II) proposal, we seek to develop a mass spectrometry-based drug
screening system utilizing paper spray mass spectrometry. The outcomes of this project will
include two disposable cartridge devices which perform sample collection, storage, extraction,
and ionization for MS detection. In addition to the disposable devices, we will also develop a
simple manually operated and a second automated mass spectrometer interface which will enable
analysis of the sample analysis cartridge on commercially available mass spectrometers. Finally,
we will create instrument control and data analysis software package to provide a complete, end-
to-end solution for drug screening.
 In phase I of this proposal, a prototype for the disposable paper spray analysis cartridge
as well as the manual mass spectrometry interface will be developed and tested. If the
performance of the analysis cartridge and interface are adequate for screening a representative
set of synthetic drugs, we will proceed to phase II. In the second phase, we will improve the sample
analysis cartridge, develop a sample collection device which will enable robust collection of a
known volume of blood from an unspecified initial volume, develop the automated MS interface,
develop needed control and data analysis software, and test the performance of the approach on
both high resolution and low resolution mass spectrometers."
10784256,"Summary: While ABO(H) blood group antigens were the first human polymorphisms described and
corresponding anti-ABO(H) antibodies continue to be the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and
transplantation, the factors responsible for anti-ABO(H) antibody development remain relatively unknown. In
order to overcome barriers that result from anti-ABO(H) antibody formation, key processes that drive anti-ABO(H)
antibody development need to be defined. Our long-term goal is to define the factors that regulate naturally
occurring anti-ABO(H) antibody formation. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to microbes that decorate
themselves with ABO(H) blood group-like antigens drives innate-like B1 B cells to produce naturally occurring
anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our recent discovery that microbes that
decorate themselves with carbohydrate structures that mimic blood group antigens stimulate the formation of
anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Our data demonstrate
that anti-ABO(H) antibodies isolated from patients display unique specificity for distinct types of ABO(H) antigens
and when examined against microbial glycans isolated and presented on a microbial glycan microarray, engage
unique microbial determinants, strongly suggesting that microbial glycans may shape an individual's anti-ABO(H)
antibody response. However, as ABO(H) blood group antigens are carbohydrate structures largely confined to
humans, preclinical models capable of formally testing this have not been available. To overcome this limitation,
we developed a preclinical model that recapitulates key features of naturally occurring anti-blood group antibody
formation. Knocking out the enzyme required for the synthesis of the murine blood group B-like antigen (murine
B or Bm), we generated blood group O-like (murine O or Om) mice that spontaneously develop varying levels of
anti-Bm antibodies capable of causing Bm RBC HTRs following transfusion. Sorting and culturing anti-Bm reactive
microbiota identified a strain of Klebsiella pneumonia that specifically expresses the Bm antigen, providing a
possible link between the microbiota and anti-Bm antibody development. As blood group Om mice and O
individuals possess innate-like B1 B cells with blood group specificity, these collective data suggest that microbial
stimulation of B1 B cells drives the formation of anti-blood group antibodies capable of causing HTRs. To test
this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the role of B1 B cells and anti-blood
group antibody reactive microbiota in the development of anti-ABO(H) antibodies capable of causing
HTRs. Aim 2. Define the requirement for B1 B cells in microbiota-induced anti-Bm antibody formation
using a preclinical model. These aims will not only define the impact of the microbiota on the development of
anti-blood group antibodies, but provide a rich training opportunity for me to weld my previous training in
transfusion immunology with new training in glycobiology to define the governing factors that regulate the
development of the most common immunological barrier in not only transfusion, but also transplantation."
10788473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Up to a quarter of older US adults have a poor sense of smell, a sensory impairment which most are unaware
of. We and others found that poor olfaction is an important early symptom of dementia and Parkinson’s disease
(PD), and robustly predicts accelerated mortality. Others also speculate that poor olfaction adversely affects
nutrition, safety, and quality of life, but rigorous empirical data are largely lacking. Our most recent analysis
revealed that dementia, PD, and weight loss combined explained only ~30% of poor olfaction-associated excess
mortality in older adults, leaving a large portion of the potential causes of such increased mortality still unknown.
The proposed project thus aims to leverage the predictive and informational power available via inexpensive,
facile, and noninvasive olfaction testing, by answering two novel and clinically-significant questions: 1) What
adverse health outcomes can a poor sense of smell in older adults potentially herald, in addition to
neurodegenerative diseases? 2) Is poor olfaction a marker of accelerated aging? We will exploit extensive
prospective data from the Health ABC and ARIC-Neurocognitive studies – well-established community-based
biracial cohorts with comparable populations, study design, and data collection. To our knowledge, the proposed
study will be the largest to date, combining the objectively-tested sense of smell and longitudinally assessed
health outcomes in 8,630 US adults aged ≥65 years, including 56.6% women and 27.6% African Americans to
assess sex and racial influences. We hypothesize that, as an early marker and/or contributor, poor olfaction in
older adults signifies elevated risk of multiple major diseases, including but not limited to dementia and PD (Aim
1), declines in physical, pulmonary, and cognitive/mental functions, and frailty (Aim 2), and it is associated with
epigenetic markers of age acceleration (Aim 3). Based on our preliminary findings, we further hypothesize that
sex and race may modify the relationships of dementia, PD, and other adverse health outcomes associated with
a poor sense of smell. The aims are supported by our rigorous published and unpublished preliminary data, and
a multidisciplinary team of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and clinical researchers with a proven track record
of productive collaborations. Scientific rigor is assured by large sample sizes, meticulously collected health data,
carefully planned statistical analyses, cross-validation of study findings, strategized pooled analyses, and a very
experienced multi-institutional research team. Our innovative proposed analyses and predicted results will
significantly advance understanding of what poor olfaction means for the health of older adults, besides dementia
and PD, and may thus help shift the geriatric clinical paradigm toward assessing olfaction in the elderly during
clinical visits, to monitor and better anticipate risks of impending conditions, to inform the identification of at-risk
populations for novel interventional trials, and ultimately to improve the health and survival of older adults."

The broad, long-term goal of this project is to develop a pritelivir intravaginal ring (IVR) for the treatment and
pre-exposure prophylaxis of genital herpes, a common problem that affects more than 30 million Americans.
Recurrences are common and may be painful, and infection is life-long, yet few treatment options exist.
Pritelivir is a promising α-helicase inhibitor that has been proven superior to existing therapies in Phase 2
clinical trials, but whose clinical development as a systemic therapy has been slowed due to observed
unexplained systemic toxicity in primates. Therefore, pritelivir-based local therapy is of special interest.
We have developed a platform technology for the sustained release of antivirals. This technology has
successfully led to the development and commercialization of a ganciclovir intraocular implant – Vitrasert®, for
the treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis. This platform has been adapted to IVRs and through its
use we have successfully delivered other antiviral agents at therapeutic levels in preclinical and clinical trials.
We seek to utilize this platform to develop a sustained release IVR formulation for pritelivir. We achieved the
specific aims of our Phase I and II SBIR, which were to: formulate pritelivir-releasing IVRs; test their in vitro
release and in vivo safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in animals; perform chemistry, manufacturing, and
controls (CMC) activities; develop clinical documents; and submit an Investigational New Drug (IND)
application to the FDA. The successful completion of this Phase I/II SBIR work has enabled us to identify an
IVR dose for the further development of a drug product that is safe and demonstrates sustained release for 28
days and at clinically relevant levels. The IND has been placed on Clinical Hold, pending completion of
additional nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, CMC testing, and device evaluation. We, therefore,
propose in Phase IIB to accomplish the FDA-guided nonclinical activities required to enable an IND allowance.
The proposed Specific Aims of this Phase IIB SBIR are to: develop GMP-grade manufacturing capacity for the
drug substance; conduct pharmacology and toxicology studies in rodents and nonrodents; manufacture GMP-
grade drug product; perform device testing in accordance with CRDH’s comments; and re-submit an IND
application to the FDA. The milestone for the successful completion of the proposed Phase IIB work is the
approval of an IND to perform a first-in-human exploratory clinical trial for a pritelivir IVR. In future work, we will
test the lead formulation for safety and PK in female volunteers in accordance with our FDA-approved clinical
protocol. The team of investigators are experts in drug development, synthetic chemistry, pharmacokinetics,
and clinical infectious disease, and have experience collaborating with large pharmaceutical companies to
enable New Drug Approvals (NDAs) of novel drug delivery systems. This project could lead rapidly to the
development of an improved treatment and prophylaxis for genital herpes."
10760285,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Viruses are generally considered to be agents of destruction that must be efficiently eliminated by the host for
self-preservation. However, viruses are also the largest reservoir of genetic diversity on the planet, and viral
infections (estimated 1023 infections per second) are a primary mechanism for delivering new genes to naïve
hosts. Thus, viruses have a complex role in the process of evolution, being both a major source of disease and
mortality, while simultaneously presenting the cellular community with new opportunities for genetic innovation.
In bacteria, viruses (i.e., phages) are major purveyors of genes that confer virulence and antibiotic resistance,
and thus play a major role in the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis. The long-term goal of our research is to
understand the impact of phage defense systems on the evolution and ecology of human-associated microbial
communities. We are interested in understanding the dynamic processes that balance host preservation
(defense from lethal infection) with the advantages of sampling foreign DNA for selectively advantageous traits.
Specifically, the work outlined in this proposal is aimed at determining the mechanisms of two evolutionarily
distinct immune systems that both rely on small RNA or small DNA guides for sequence-specific recognition of
invading genetic elements. The proposal is divided into two projects, with an eye toward developing new tools
for applications in molecular biology and medicine. Project 1 focuses on understanding the phylogenetic and
functional diversity of phage encoded anti-CRISPRs that suppress CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune
systems. Project 2 aims to understand the functional diversity of Argonaute proteins in bacteria and archaea.
Results from this research will provide mechanistic insights that contribute to our long-term goal and have
significance implications in the near-term application of these emerging tools for precise genome engineering."
10759435,"Project 1 Summary:
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry a variety of RNAs, including both coding and noncoding RNAs. These
RNAs have the potential to influence cell and tissue phenotypes. Indeed for miRNAs there are now many
examples of EV-carried miRNA controlling gene expression and function in recipient cells. RNA-Seq analyses
have demonstrated specific enrichment of some RNAs in EVs, compared to the cellular content. However, very
little is known about the specific mechanisms by which RNA is transported into EVs.
 The current paradigm, based on several studies, is that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are responsible
for the selective and specific inclusion of RNAs in EVs. However, how those RBPs connect to cellular
membranes to be incorporated into shed microvesicles (MVs) or late endosome-derived exosomes is
unknown. A notable finding is that many RBPs identified in EVs are typically associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) in cells, suggesting a potential role for the ER in transfer of those moieties to other organelles.
Furthermore, the RNA-induced silencing complex is assembled on mRNA-ribosome complexes associated
with the ER (rough ER), suggesting a route for miRNA-RBP association with the ER and subsequently other
membranes. Based on these findings and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that ER-plasma membrane
(PM) and ER-multivesicular endosome (MVE) membrane contact sites (MCS) are critical for transfer of RNAs
and RBPs into shed microvesicles and exosomes. We further hypothesize that signaling and lipid transfer
events taking place at these contacts further regulate RNA transport into vesicles. We will test these
hypotheses and determine the impact of MCS on transfer of RNAs to recipient cells and CRC tumor growth
and cetuximab resistance."

Iron and thiol redox homeostasis have interdependent roles in cellular metabolism. Iron serves as a cofactor for
a wide variety of proteins and enzymes in essential biochemical pathways, but excess iron can be damaging to
cells by catalyzing formation of reactive oxygen species that disrupt thiol redox homeostasis. Intracellular thiol-
disulfide balance is critical, in turn, for the activity of proteins with functionally important cysteine residues, which
includes many Fe-binding proteins. The tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and glutaredoxin (Grx) proteins function
together in both thiol redox control and iron homeostasis by facilitating redox reactions and participating in iron-
sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis pathways. Our previous work in the non-pathogenic yeast S. cerevisiae and S.
pombe have revealed the molecular mechanisms by which a subclass of Grxs, known as monothiol Grxs, bind
and deliver GSH-ligated Fe-S clusters to communicate iron bioavailability to the transcription factors Aft1/Aft2 in
S. cerevisiae and Php4 in S. pombe that regulate iron acquisition and utilization pathways. Furthermore, we have
used molecular genetics and cell biology approaches coupled with in vivo redox measurements via genetically-
encoded fluorescent redox sensors to characterize GSH subcellular trafficking pathways that impact both iron
homeostasis and redox regulation in S. cerevisiae. Here we will extend these findings by studying the impact of
GSH and Grxs on the Fe-S binding properties and DNA binding affinity of the S. pombe transcription factor Fep1
that represses Fe uptake pathways during iron repletion. Furthermore, we will define the molecular details of iron
regulation pathways in pathogenic yeast (Candida glabrata, Candida albicans) that express homologs of
monothiol Grxs, Aft1/2, Fep1, and Php4, but for which little mechanistic information is available. In parallel, we
will characterize GSH:GSSG flux between subcellular compartments in yeast cells and measure the impact of
GSH deficiency, excess, or impaired trafficking on essential metal metabolism. Our innovative approach to
accomplish these goals is to combine yeast molecular genetics and cell biology techniques with biochemical,
structural, and biophysical methods (UV-visible absorption and CD spectroscopy, EXAFS, X-ray crystallography,
Mössbauer, EPR, and single cell ICP-TOF-MS). The in vitro biochemical, structural, and biophysical studies will
be used to probe protein-protein, metal-protein, and protein-DNA interactions in iron sensing pathways to
uncover the molecular details of iron signaling and to monitor single cell metallomic changes in yeast populations
in response to alterations in iron or GSH metabolism. The genetics and cell biology studies test how these
molecular interactions and metallome changes influence the in vivo functions and dynamic localization of iron
signaling and GSH metabolism factors. Overall, this multidisciplinary research program is designed to tease out
the mechanistic details of iron regulation and subcellular thiol redox control at the cellular and molecular level.
By studying both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi we will compare and contrast different strategies for
adapting to redox perturbations and high/low iron environments."
10762344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to elucidate novel mechanisms underlying exercise training (ExT)-induced sympatho-
inhibition in chronic heart failure (CHF) (Aim 1) and cardioprotection following acute coronary
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) (Aim 2), based on an innovative concept of inter-organ transfer of antioxidant
enzymes. It is well established that exercise generates muscle-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) which
activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), resulting in upregulation of a panel of antioxidant
enzymes in skeletal muscle per se. We hypothesize that these antioxidants can be transported from skeletal
muscle to remote tissues through circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), providing recipient cells with a
second and enhanced line of antioxidant defense. In the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of mice with
CHF, these antioxidants restore redox homeostasis of pre-sympathetic neurons, contributing to ExT-sympatho-
inhibition. Furthermore, in the heart of mice subjected to coronary I/R, these antioxidants reduce free radical
damage and salvage ischemic myocardium, thus playing a critical role in ExT-cardioprotection. To address
these hypotheses, we developed three skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mouse lines. The MS-mG line is a
reporter model, which allows us to track, capture, and analyze EVs released specifically from skeletal muscle.
This model will be used to assay cargo proteins of skeletal muscle-derived EVs and their distribution in brain
and heart following ExT. The iMS-Nrf2flox/flox and iMS-Keap1flox/flox lines will enable us to delete skeletal muscle
Nrf2 (i.e. Nrf2 deficiency) and Keap1 (i.e. Nrf2 overexpression), respectively. These two models will be used to
demonstrate a causal relationship between the Nrf2/antioxidant system and ExT-sympatho-inhibition in Aim 1
and ExT-cardioprotection in Aim 2. Interdisciplinary methods of EV biology, proteomics, bioinformatics,
electrophysiology, and cardiovascular physiology will be utilized to characterize skeletal muscle-derived EVs
following ExT, determine the effects of ExT-EVs on central neuron discharge and peripheral sympathetic nerve
activity, and explore the mechanisms underpinning cardioprotection of ExT-EVs against coronary I/R injury.
Upon completion of this project, we expect to provide novel mechanistic insights on ExT-cardiovascular
protection, paving a new avenue to translate the beneficial effects of regular physical activity into clinical
practice to prevent and treat acute and chronic ischemic heart diseases."

Telehealth utilization increased rapidly across the US healthcare system in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. As we emerge from the pandemic, telehealth has become a new option for communication between
patients and providers. Cancer care delivery appears well positioned to incorporate telehealth into the standard
workflow of patient care. Furthermore, equitable implementation of telehealth could potentially increase access
to care among vulnerable patients. However, emerging data suggest disparities with telehealth utilization
access among non-White, low income, and non-English speaking individuals. Inequitable implementation of
telehealth could inadvertently create barriers among our most vulnerable patients, which could paradoxically
increase cancer health disparities. Large-scale rigorous research evaluating disparities in telehealth utilization
within the post-COVID-19 cancer care environment is lacking. Furthermore, research has not addressed how
telehealth utilization influences safety and quality of care compared to conventional in-person visits, particularly
among our at-risk populations with higher baseline risks of poor outcomes and adverse events. Finally, a
comprehensive understanding of telehealth disparities requires an understanding of patient perceptions and
provider biases towards telehealth, which represent important unaddressed questions. To fill these critical
knowledge gaps, we propose a comprehensive population-based cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries
with cancer, incorporating linkages to secondary datasets providing data on providers, hospitals, and regional
factors. We will assess the impact of telehealth on vulnerable cancer populations through the following aims: 1)
identify and characterize disparities in telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) assess the
impact of telehealth on efficacy and safety of cancer delivery among at-risk populations; and 3) define
actionable patient-level barriers and provider biases with telehealth utilization. This proposed study will help
define the national landscape of telehealth among cancer patients, and will provide a framework for the
development of future interventions to optimize telehealth among at-risk patients. This timely project will deliver
actionable information to providers, healthcare systems, and policymakers. Overall, equitable, safe, and
effective telehealth delivery stands to increase access to care and reduce cancer health disparities among our
most vulnerable cancer patients."
10763973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project develops new experimental and computational methods for DEER (double electron-
electron resonance) spectroscopy. DEER is a biostructural technique for the quantification of
protein conformational landscapes and protein motions on the nanometer scale. Protein motions
are crucial for many key molecular processes at the basis of human life and disease. Therefore,
DEER provides important insights that contribute to the knowledge base necessary for drug
development. In combination with X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, NMR, FRET and others,
DEER is part of a complementary set of integrative experimental biostructural tools. It is
especially important for the study of membrane proteins. Several major barriers exist in the field:
the lack of integrated analysis and modeling tools for biomedical researchers, and the lack of
experimental approaches for studying proteins in their native cellular environment. This project
directly addresses these issues as it aims to (a) develop methods and tools based on Bayesian
statistics and deep learning for the rigorous and reproducible analysis of experimental DEER
data; (b) create advanced computational approaches that utilize DEER data for modeling
proteins; (c) develop methodology based on noncanonical amino acids for labeling proteins
directly in their cellular environment; (d) advance a rapid freeze quench approach to measure
conformational dynamics down to the sub-millisecond time scale. Overall, the goal of the project
is to significantly expand the scope of DEER by providing innovative approaches to data
analysis, modeling, and in-cell and time-resolved measurements. This will enable the study of
the structure and dynamics of larger and more complex proteins and protein assemblies in the
cellular environment. This is of increasing importance in biomedical research."

Nitrogen-containing functionalities constitute one of the largest classes within health-relevant small molecules.
Therefore, the development of new methods to construct carbon–nitrogen bonds remains paramount among
opportunities for innovation in chemical synthesis. The Haber–Bosch process is arguably the most important
synthetic catalytic process, wherein atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is reduced to ammonia (NH3) by an iron catalyst
under high temperature and pressure. In contrast, nature’s N2 fixation catalysts, nitrogenases, operate at ambient
conditions using a bimetallic active site. As such, many well-defined coordination complexes have been
developed to study key bond-forming steps in N2 reduction, with the goal of designing more efficient catalysts for
the synthesis of ammonia and other value-added compounds. While there has been some success in catalytic
N2 silylation to give tris(trialkylsilyl)amines, there are no examples of the analogous catalytic process for amine
synthesis through carbon–nitrogen bond-formation from N2. Current strategies for the direct conversion of N2
amines require multistep synthetic sequences of metal–N2 complexes with organic electrophiles and subsequent
product release under harsh conditions. To circumvent these limitations, the proposed research employs
metallocene-based catalysts to promote proton-coupled electron-transfer pathways for radical functionalization
of metal–N2 catalysts. Enabled by a renaissance in organic radical generation, easy access to a suite of abundant
olefins, and by exploiting complementary reactivity modes of metal–N2 catalysts, a diverse range of primary,
secondary, and aryl amine products can be synthesized. The research plan outlines specific approaches that
will deliver fundamental insights into reactions of metal–N2 complexes with organic radicals and metal nitrides,
commonly proposed intermediates in N2 reduction, with alkenes. These studies will provide the foundation for
the realization of a catalytic synthesis of medicinally relevant functional groups from the most abundant source
of nitrogen—N2."

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of
dementia among older adults, 65 years and older. AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid
β plaques (Aβ), intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs), and brain-wide neuroinflammation. Many current
therapeutics targeting either Aβ or tau development have not been successful; therefore, it is imperative to
understand the mechanisms in which these pathological hallmarks interact and influence each other. Aβ plaques
develop many years before disease onset and do not correlate with clinical symptoms like the spread of tau.
Moreover, immunotherapy targeting amyloid has failed to show cognitive improvement despite the significant
reduction in Aβ load. While NFT-like tau pathology can develop without the presence of Aβ, the introduction of
Aβ fibrils significantly accelerates NFT formation, further highlighting the need to better understand their
molecular interactions. Recently, a case study has identified a carrier of the familial AD PSEN1 E280A mutation
with a rare mutation in APOE3 (APOE R136S or APOE3ch) that resulted in resistance to neurodegeneration
along with reduced NFTs while still exhibiting an elevated amyloid plaque load in the brain. The R136S mutation
is located in a region of APOE known to have a role in binding to lipoprotein receptors and heparan sulfate
proteoglycan (HSPGs), which have been suggested to promote amyloid-β aggregation and neuronal uptake of
extracellular tau. Therefore, the APOE3ch mutation provides a unique interface to study the interaction between
Aβ and tau. To that end, we have developed a novel ApoEch mouse model to be crossed with two different
mouse models of amyloid and tau, 5xFAD and PS19, respectively. Thus, I propose to 1) Examine the protective
effect of the ApoEch mutation in reducing tau pathology and rescuing neurodegeneration in PS19 mice, and 2)
Assess the protective effect of the ApoEch mutation in dampening Aβ-associated plaque pathology and
inflammation in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, this proposal will elucidate the role of this unique mutation in the
development and manifestation of both Aβ and tau pathologies in mice."

Haiti has the largest number of persons with HIV (PWH) in the Caribbean. PWH have a higher risk of developing
metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are leading causes of mortality among Haitians and other
residents of low and middle-income countries (LMICs), driven in part by high rates of hypertension, elevated
fasting plasma glucose and high body mass index. Weight gain is common early after starting antiretroviral
therapy (ART), particularly among PWH on an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen. The
INSTI-containing combination regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir (TLD) is the
most commonly prescribed ART regimen in LMICs, but at present there are few data on the consequences of
weight gain on ART in these settings. Consequently, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to 1)
Determine the features and severity of cardiometabolic disease risk accompanying weight gain among TLD
recipients in LMICs, including insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, lipid profiles and systemic inflammation; and 2)
Determine the metabolic mechanisms underlying weight gain to guide the development and implementation of
effective prevention and treatment strategies.
GHESKIO (Groupe Haitien d’Etude du Sarcome et des Infections Opportunities) is the largest HIV clinic in the
Americas, a founding member of CCASAnet (the Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV
epidemiology) and has a 37-year track record of NIH research on HIV and associated comorbidities. Building
upon this infrastructure, our multi-disciplinary study will leverage advanced metabolic phenotyping and multiomic
data analysis to elucidate the bioenergetic pathways underlying weight gain on TLD and the cardiometabolic
consequences among PWH in LMIC, where diet and lifestyle factors differ from higher income countries.
Aim 1 will assess whether weight gain on TLD is associated with increased insulin resistance, blood pressure,
dyslipidemia, and inflammation. We will enroll 200 previously ART-naïve patients who initiated TLD at GHESKIO
12 to 24 months previously and gained <3% versus 10% body weight to define the factors associated with
weight gain including sociodemographic variables, appetite, food security and physical activity, and whether
weight gain is associated with higher HOMA-IR, fasting lipids, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
inflammatory markers linked to CVD. Aim 2 will determine the metabolic and lipid pathways associated with
weight gain in the first 12 months of TLD exposure using metabolomic and lipidomic profiling. We will enroll 60
ART-naïve patients initiating TLD and perform fasting metabolomic and lipidomic profiling at baseline and 12
months to identify the pre-ART pathways predisposing to weight gain. This project will develop new capacity for
sophisticated cardiometabolic research and analyses at GHESKIO and within CCASAnet more broadly, and the
results of this study will provide preliminary data on whether weight gain on TLD may represent an emerging
threat to health outcomes in the context of the wide implementation of this regimen in LMICs across the world."

 The retina is an excellent model for studying the development and function of neural circuitry. The
retina contains five major neuronal classes which can be subdivided into well over a hundred neuronal
subtypes. Amacrine Cells (ACs), one of the five neuronal classes, comprise only one percent of the retinal cell
population, but account for around half of this subtype diversity. Only a handful of AC subtypes have been
studied in depth, in part due to a lack of tools to prospectively isolate and manipulate individual populations.
Therefore, our understanding of how visual circuits function remains incomplete. For example, recent work
shows that the direction selective circuit, one of the most well-studied circuits in the retina, includes glycinergic
input from an undefined AC subtype. To fully understand how ACs contribute to visual processing it is
imperative to study more AC subtypes and their defining features.
 In preliminary studies, I identified a Robo3CreER mouse line that genetically labels a population of
previously undescribed glycinergic amacrine cells. Based on their morphology and stratification pattern, I
hypothesize that these Robo3+ amacrine cells (RACs) may be the cells that supply glycinergic inhibition to ON
starburst amacrine cells in the direction selective circuit. I will employ mouse genetics, confocal microscopy, in
situ hybridization, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, I will define the
morphological properties and population-level organization of RACs. In Aim 2, I will determine whether RACs
form inhibitory synapses onto ON starburst amacrine cells. In Aim 3, I will determine whether Robo3 plays a
role in RAC development and/or function. These aims will broaden our knowledge of how individual cellular
components function together in retinal circuitry."

 Lymphocytes are capable of robust expansion upon antigen receptor stimulation and are one of the
most rapidly dividing cells postnatally. Their proliferation capacity is critical for establishing broad antigen
receptor repertoires during development and also for rapidly amplifying antigen-specific immunity upon
pathogen invasion. In addition, T cells can also be expanded ex vivo for experiments or adoptive cell therapies
and the generation of CAR-T cells, which have been translated into anti-cancer therapies. While such robust
expansion of T cells generates many effector cells, they are short-lived and unsustainable for efficacious
control of infection and cancers. The goal of the proposed study is to dissect the mechanisms by which robust
proliferation is coupled to such differentiation at the molecular level. We will elucidate the gene regulatory
network initiated by the transcription factor c-MYC, which is oncogenic but also critical for rapid proliferation of
lymphocytes at many checkpoints, in developing lymphocytes and mature lymphocytes, and define key MYC
downstream genes specifically associated with the differentiation processes. Insights from these studies and
selective inhibition of the differentiation processes will disclose unappreciated tumor suppressor programs and
facilitate expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes with memory/stem-like properties for long-lasting
protection against infection and cancers."
10912518,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
In cancer cells, exposure of self DNA to the cytosol is driven by a variety of genomic instabilities such as
micronuclei, chromatin bridges, and nuclear ruptures. This cytosolic DNA can be recognized by cytosolic DNA
sensors such as cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), which triggers a downstream innate immune response.
Interestingly and confoundingly, the activation of the cGAS/STING innate immune pathway can protect or
sensitize tumors to immunotherapeutic interventions depending on the specific context. Therefore, insight into
the ways in which cGAS/STING signaling is regulated in cancer can inform targeted intervention. Sources of
cytosolic DNA in cancer cells arise primarily from defects in mitosis that lead to the enclosure of chromosomes
in micronuclei that are prone to rupture. These ruptured micronuclei recruit cGAS and nuclear envelope
reformation (NER) factors—such as LEM2, CHMP7, and BAF—but it remains unknown how, or if, these NER
factors impact cGAS/STING signaling but there is emerging evidence in published and in our preliminary data
that there is potential crosstalk between cGAS/STING signaling and NER proteins. The goal of this proposal
is to provide key insights into the regulation of the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA in cancer
cells by nuclear envelope reformation factors. In order to achieve this goal, I will use transfected herring
testes (HT) DNA and transfected DNA-coated beads as models for cytosolic DNA as this can be more readily
controlled compared to the stochastic formation of micronuclei, only some of which are unstable and prone to
rupture. With this model, I will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing and the auxin-inducible-degron (AID) conditional
degradation system to probe the roles of NER factors in cGAS/STING signaling in response to transfected HT
DNA and DNA beads. This proposal will address fundamental aspects of cell biology and innate immune
signaling that will shed light on immunotherapeutic targets for cancer."

 When we are confronted with unclear or vague information about our world, we rely heavily on memory to
fill in missing data and ultimately guide behaviors. For example, if you encounter a massive four-legged animal
alongside its cub while hiking in a forest, your subsequent actions rely not merely on identifying the animal, but
reacting appropriately once you remember that bears are dangerous. What mechanisms in the brain are
responsible for recognizing, identifying, and categorizing objects, all of which can occur within hundreds of
milliseconds? This question is inherently linked to the semantic memory system, which acts as the interface
between incoming sensory information and our preexisting knowledge of the meaning of words, images,
concepts, and their associations. The primary goal of the proposed research is to better understand the
temporal dynamics of how semantic categorization occurs in the human brain.
 One method to study semantic categorization is by framing it as a decision that occurs in the brain.
Research on decision-making across several species (e.g., mice, monkeys, and humans) has shown that
decision-making requires a specific computation where evidence is accumulated until a particular threshold is
met, indicating a decision has been reached. This framework (drift-diffusion models, DDMs) has helped to
uncover several decision-making signals across the brain depending on the task, leading researchers to
believe DDMs could be a brain-general mechanism. For this to be true, DDMs should be able to explain activity
in the human ventral visual stream during object recognition tasks. The first aim of this study is to identify
where in the human ventral visual stream can best be described by decision-making signals. The main
hypothesis is that during a semantic categorization task, decision-making signals should occur in the anterior
temporal lobe (ATL), which has been implicated in recent decades as the brain’s semantic hub.
 The second aim of this study is to examine how the brain categorizes (e.g., blurred, occluded) visual
stimuli. On a behavioral level, humans require more time to perform object recognition when images are less
clear. One possible explanatory neural mechanism would involve the same neural processes as unambiguous
visual recognition that just occurs more slowly. A contrasting hypothesis is that additional brain areas must be
recruited to solve ambiguity. For instance, accessing stored memories via the medial temporal lobe (MTL) may
be enlisted to call upon previous experiences. Another option relies on a greater degree of cognitive control
from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This research project will leverage the spatiotemporal precision offered by
intracranial recordings in humans. This study can illuminate cognitive systems and brain networks that are
often damaged in diseases affecting memory, including Alzheimer’s Disease and Semantic Dementia."

Nearly all species of bacteria require iron to grow because it is an essential metal cofactor that is used by
microbial enzymes to mediate cellular metabolism. During infections, bacterial pathogens forage iron from
human hemoglobin (Hb) that is released from red blood cells, which contains ∼75–80% of the human body's
total iron content in the form of heme (iron protoporphyrin IX). The basic science studies outlined in this proposal
will determine how the human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae acquires iron from Hb. This work will have
a broad impact, as C. diphtheriae is a model organism within the Actinobacteria phylum, which contains several
species of bacteria that are human pathogens, as well as microbes that are major components of the human
gastrointestinal microbiome. Research will be performed by an established team of investigators that have
complementary expertise in microbiology, proteomics, biochemistry and structural biology. We will determine
how microbial receptors capture Hb and remove its heme, and how cell wall embedded proteins ferry released
heme into the cell. In aim #1, we will determine how C. diphtheriae uses the HbpA receptor to capture Hb on the
cell surface and test the hypothesis that the receptor works in concert with surface associated heme-receptors
to distort Hb and trigger heme release. In aim #2, we will determine the molecular basis through which heme is
passed across the cell wall by determining how widely distributed Conserved Region (CR) domains in
Actinobacteria directly exchange heme by forming low-affinity transfer complexes. In aim #3, we will obtain a
systems-level understanding of the heme uptake process by applying mass spectrometry proteomics methods
to determine each component’s abundance and location, and by developing and applying a novel fluorogenic
Hb-reporter to track heme removal from Hb in cell culture. These studies will enable us to quantitatively assess
the importance of each system component in heme uptake, and to test the hypothesis that they form a molecular
wire through which heme flows to the membrane. The results of these studies will provide fundamental insight
into how C. diphtheriae and other Actinobacteria acquire heme-iron, and develop generalizable tools to study
this process in live bacteria. Combined, the results of this research could lead to new therapeutics to treat
infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria that work by disrupting heme import."

translational approach for investigating the relationship between mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) exposure(s),
modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, and non-invasive measures of chronic cerebral microvascular pathology,
including advanced neuroimaging modalities.
Research Design and Methodology: Through resource sharing, previously collected and archived clinical
data, neuroimaging data, and blood samples from the joint DoD/VA Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant
Brain Injury Consortium – Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (LIMBIC-CENC) Prospective
Longitudinal Study Cohort will be utilized to perform a retrospective cohort study.
Aim-I will investigate potential associations between mTBI exposure(s) and advanced neuroimaging measures
of chronic cerebral microvascular pathology. Primary analysis will explore associations between the number of
mTBI exposures (none, 1-2, or 3+) and two independent advanced neuroimaging measures of cerebral
microvascular pathology (white matter hyperintensity quantification with Brain Intensity Abnormality
Classification Algorithm [BIANCA] analysis, and diffusion-MRI Free Water Volume Fraction [FW-VF] analysis)
at a single point in time (initial neuroimaging acquisition upon entry into the LIMBIC-CENC study), adjusting for
both age and sex. Secondary analysis will further categorize the mTBI exposure history into 7 severity
subgroups (accounting for the presence or absence of associated post-traumatic amnesia and loss of
consciousness), and then explore associations between resulting mTBI exposure severity and BIANCA / FW-
VF advanced neuroimaging analysis, adjusting for age and sex.
Aim-II will investigate potential associations between modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and advanced
neuroimaging measures of chronic cerebral microvascular pathology. Using a combination of ideal
cardiovascular health (I-CVH) behaviors (physical activity, sleep duration, smoking and alcohol use) and
factors (body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus status), we will calculate
patient-specific I-CVH Index scores and explore associations with BIANCA / FW-VF neuroimaging measures of
cerebral microvascular pathology, adjusting for age, sex and mTBI exposure(s) as independent risk factors. In
addition, we will evaluate longitudinal changes in cerebral microvascular pathology at 1, 3 & 5-year follow-up.

The overall goal of this proposal is to define the role of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in endothelial cells
in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Exciting preliminary data generated through genomic
sequencing experiments show that endothelial GR up-regulates canonical Wnt signaling and that suppression
of Wnt signaling can improve atherosclerosis, quiet inflammation, and restore central endothelial metabolic
defects. The Wnt pathways have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other states
of vascular inflammation though have not been well-studied in cell-specific environments.
To investigate the effects of endothelial-cell specific canonical Wnt signaling suppression we propose the
following Aims:
In Aim 1, we will characterize the atherosclerotic phenotype of a novel double-mutant mouse model that lacks
the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/LRP6) in endothelial cells.
These are key proteins necessary for canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, we will analyze endothelial cell
inflammation, vascular function, and nitric oxide production in this model. We will also examine markers of fibrosis
and systemic blood pressure.
In Aim 2, our broad goal is to analyze central endothelial metabolism and gene expression in the presence and
absence of Wnt signaling. In Aim 2.1 we plan to evaluate the in vitro metabolic phenotypes of endothelial cells
with suppressed Wnt signaling by assaying fatty acid oxidation, cellular lipid metabolism, mitochondrial
bioenergetics, and fuel preference. In Aim 2.2, we will examine endothelial cell heterogeneity by performing
single-cell RNA-seq from aortas of mice with augmented and suppressed Wnt signaling. These studies will be
extended by examining chromatin capture conformation in key differentially-regulated metabolic genes. These
data sets will be integrated to conclude how chromatin conformation affects the functionality of key genes of
interest."
10754235,"Project Summary/Abstract
A growing number of epidemiological studies link childhood asthma with maternal environmental exposures
with the strongest evidence provided for cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust. Mechanisms how maternal
exposures lead to asthma in offspring are unknown. To address this, we developed a mouse model, inducing
asthma susceptibility in young mice by exposing their mothers to diesel exhaust particles (DEP). We then
discovered that asthma in this model was driven in part by natural killer (NK) cells. This finding was surprising
because it did not fit into the traditional paradigm of NK cells serving as a body’s defense instrument designed
to KILL. Our new data indicate, that instead, NK cells are part of a homeostatic response to REPAIR (NOT kill)
fetal tissues that are metabolically-impaired by diesel exhaust, and that metabolic impairment is the primordial
cause of asthma predisposition in our model. Metabolic impairment of DEP pups manifests itself in their
reduced weight. The body’s first response to growth-limiting insults is induction of pro-survival factors.
Accordingly, hematopoietic tissues of DEP fetuses and pups over-produce growth arrest-specific protein 6
(Gas6), a cytokine known to be induced under conditions of reduced metabolism and impaired growth to
protect tissues from death and promote their repair. Tissue repair has long been linked to type-2 immune
responses. Consistent with this, injections of Gas6 promote type-2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) activation and
asthma in normal pups. We hypothesize that Gas6 effects are at least in part due to induction of a type-2
program in developing NK cells, and that this program endows NK cells with a capacity to orchestrate
responses of type-2 lymphocytes. Gas6 is a recognized enhancer of NK cell development. It is also a known
activator of STAT6, a transcriptional factor linked to type-2 differentiation. Accordingly, NK cell development is
enhanced in DEP offspring and their mature NK cells produce the type-2 cytokine IL13. We further show that in
DEP pups, NK cells drive production of epithelial IL25 and activation of ILC2 and Th2 cells. In addition to
producing IL13, DEP NK cells have enhanced ability to degranulate. We propose that these two traits underlie
the unique capacity of DEP NK cells to activate type-2 immunity. We show that the granule protease granzyme
B (Gzmb) potently synergizes with IL13 to induce IL25 from airway epithelial cells. Our overarching hypothesis
is that maternal exposure to DEP promotes asthma susceptibility in offspring by impairing their metabolism and
growth; this provokes a repair response, part of which is induction of Gas6 that programs NK cells for
enhanced secretion of IL13 and granzyme B, leading to production of IL25 and activation of ILC2 and Th2
cells. In Aim 1, we will study NK cell-driven mechanisms of prenatally-programmed asthma, focusing on NK
cell mediators (Gzmb and IL13) and IL25. In Aim 2, we will study importance of Gas6 in NK cell programming
and transmission of asthma susceptibility. In Aim 3, we will use human blood samples to test a hypothesis that
over-activation of the Gas6 pathway in NK cells in early childhood is a predictor of future asthma."

Kidney transplantation (KT) is increasing for older adults (≥50) with ESRD. In 2021, older adults received
roughly 60% of all KTs and are at increased risk of dementia/Alzheimer’s disease (AD). KT recipients who
develop dementia/AD post-transplant have a 2.4-fold increased risk of mortality and a 1.5-fold increased risk of
graft loss. Of older KT recipients who are diagnosed with dementia/AD, 88.6% die within 10 years. These
deaths may be due to inability to perform self-care, inadequate nutrition, or medication non-adherence.
Despite these risks, predicting who will develop post KT dementia/AD is not part of pre-KT evaluation.
Furthermore, factors routinely measured at pre-KT evaluation (age, sex, comorbidities, etc.) have only
moderate predictive power for post-KT dementia/AD. Predicting post-KT dementia/AD risk can help identify
older candidates who would benefit from interventions such as cognitive prehabilitation or post-KT surveillance.
Predicting post-KT dementia/AD risk at transplant evaluation provides enough time to intervene prior to KT.
To design a geriatric-specific model that can predict post-KT dementia/AD risk utilizing machine learning, we
will leverage an ongoing NIA-funded R01 prospective longitudinal cohort study of frailty among older KT
candidates to accomplish the following aims: (1) To identify dementia/AD cases and possible subtypes among
KT recipients and quantify the cumulative incidence of AD/dementia in KT recipients in this ongoing cohort
study; (2) To identify clinical, geriatric, and ESRD-specific risk factors that are associated with post-KT
dementia/AD; and (3) To design a model with the aid of machine learning that successfully predicts the risk of
post-KT dementia/AD in older patients undergoing KT evaluation. Our group’s expertise in frailty and
dementia/AD and access to the ongoing Frailty Assessment in Renal Disease (FAIR) cohort, along with Dr.
Long’s training interests in machine learning and regression, provide a unique opportunity to build prediction
models that could identify older candidates at highest risk of post-KT dementia/AD.
We hypothesize that a risk prediction tool that incorporates traditional clinical, geriatric, and ESRD-specific risk
factors that are commonly measured at KT evaluation, will improve post-KT dementia/AD risk prediction. If the
proposed aims are achieved, we will improve our ability to identify older patients at increased risk of developing
post-KT dementia/AD, who will need additional interventions to improve post-KT outcomes."

Our laboratory investigates the functional organization of mammalian membranes to generate mechanistic
insight into the connections between lipid composition, membrane structure, and cell physiology. Membranes
host a major fraction of all cellular bioactivity, orchestrating myriad simultaneous, parallel tasks. This
functionality is enabled by the remarkable complexity and diversity of mammalian lipidomes, which give rise to
a unique combination of biophysical phenotypes, including membrane fluidity, tension, curvature, and lateral
compartmentalization. We aim for a predictive understanding of how lipidomic features determine membrane
properties, and how these in turn regulate cell functions. Progress towards this goal has been enabled by
recent methodological advances in high-throughput lipidomics, biophysical analysis of plasma membranes,
and quantitative high-resolution spectral microscopy. Using these, we have made significant advances in
understanding several interrelated aspects of lateral and transverse organization of mammalian membranes.
We have defined broad structural features responsible for protein association with ordered membrane domains
and how such domains are involved in membrane traffic. Despite these insights, there remains remarkably little
known about which proteins associate with membrane domains and why. Our experimental and computational
framework allows us to address key outstanding questions, including: what are the structural codes for protein
affinity for ordered domains, and how does protein association with membrane domains facilitate their
localization and function? In parallel, we have characterized the remarkable plasticity of mammalian
membranes (particularly their susceptibility to dietary fatty acids) and characterized the effects of external
inputs on membrane properties and cell function. However, how cells maintain membrane homeostasis in
response to continuous challenge from dietary and other external inputs is not well understood. Our
observations suggest that interference with such homeostatic mechanisms may provide a novel therapeutic
strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease or cancer. Finally, our most recent work has focused on the
asymmetric distribution of lipids between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane bilayer. Although such
compositional asymmetry appears to be a universal design principle for living membranes, the selective
advantages that asymmetry confers are not known. We are defining the compositional, biophysical, and
functional asymmetry of the plasma membrane in mammalian cells to answer major open questions about the
biophysical consequences of membrane asymmetry and how physical properties are coupled across
asymmetric leaflets. Functionally, intriguing recent discoveries reveal that transient loss of membrane
asymmetry is widespread during immune activation, and is necessary for optimal response; however, the
mechanisms underlying these effects of transient lipid scrambling are unknown. Addressing these questions
will advance our understanding of the functional role of membrane organization across the tree of life."
10758563,"Herpes simplex virus is a prevalent pathogen that infects the majority of the human population. Viral DNA replication is an essential step in the virus life cycle and can be targeted by antiviral treatments. Herpesviral DNA replication is coupled to other viral processes including transcription, DNA recombination, and DNA repair. However, there are critical gaps in our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which these processes are coordinated and regulated on the viral DNA. The recent development of proteomic approaches to study protein association with replication forks has enabled an in depth look at this fundamental process within cells. In addition to the viral replication machinery, select host chromatin remodeling, transcription, DNA modifying, and DNA repair factors associate with HSV-1 replication forks. Our long-term goal is to uncover how HSV-1 subverts host cellular factors to replicating viral DNA to coordinate viral DNA synthesis with DNA damage response pathways, DNA repair, and transcription in vivo. In the proposed aims, proteomic and genome-wide assays will be used to 1) investigate mechanisms that couple the viral replication machinery to cellular DNA repair pathways, 2) determine how cellular factors mediate the replication coupled switch to activate late gene transcription, and 3) dissect how replication fork associated factors regulate viral DNA topology and genome integrity. Innovative approaches will be employed to define the functions of host proteins during viral DNA replication. How viral modification of cellular factors alters cellular DNA replication and repair will also be investigated. Host proteins that are exploited during viral DNA replication can be targeted by antiviral therapies. Furthermore, insight into how viral replication is coordinated with the DNA damage response, viral chromatin, and transcription regulation will aid in the development of effective HSV-1 based gene therapy approaches and oncolytic vectors."

Dynamin GTPases have critical roles in mediating endocytosis by wrapping around the neck of budding vesicles
to catalyze membrane fission necessary for the release of nascent vesicles from the plasma membrane.
Recently, we discovered a novel role for dynamin in bundling numerous actin filaments, which has implications
for actin-mediated processes, such as cell-cell fusion and migration. While structural and biophysical studies
have elucidated the mechanism of dynamin assembly and constriction of membranes, several unanswered
questions remain including how dynamin is actually organized and mediates fission within cells, how dynamin
forms the final pre-fission state where it wraps around lipid tubules in a superconstricted state, how dynamin
binds substrates via the proline rich domain (PRD), and how substrate binding regulates dynamin activity. The
long-term objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanism of dynamin-mediated membrane fission
from in vitro and in vivo studies, and to define the mechanism of dynamin interaction with actin and SH3 domain-
containing proteins that recruit dynamin to sites of endocytosis. These objectives will be addressed by the
following specific aims: (1) determine the atomic model of dynamin in the superconstricted prefission state
and define the structure of the PRD; (2) investigate the assembly of the dynamin helical polymer on membranes
within cells; and (3) Elucidate the mechanism of PRD interaction with actin filaments and SH3 domain-containing
binding partners. The rationale for these aims is that: (1) there is no atomic model describing the structural
basis by which dynamin constricts membranes to 3.4 nm in the superconstricted state where spontaneous
hemifission and membrane fission occurs; (2) how dynamin is actually organized in cells has not been reported;
and (3) the structure of the critical PRD and how it binds dynamin substrates including actin, amphiphysin and
intersectin is unknown. The research design and methods are as follows : Aim 1, Apply cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of full-length dynamin (containing the PRD) organized around
lipid tubules in the superconstricted state; Aim 2, obtain cryo-electron tomograms and subtomogram averages
of dynamin within cells transfected with a GTPase-deficient dynamin mutant which delays membrane fission and
extends the lifetime of dynamin helices on cellular membranes; Aim 3, obtain the cryo-EM structure of actin
filaments decorated with PRD from dynamin, as well as complexes of dynamin/amphiphysin and
dynamin/intersectin. This work is of"
10765072,"Autophagy is a cellular process in which cytosolic material is captured in double-membrane
vesicles, termed autophagosomes. Subsequently, autophagosomes fuse with the vacuole, in
yeast, or lysosomes, in mammalian cells, leading to the degradation of the captured contents.
Autophagy can capture a diversity of cytosolic cargos, including organelles, large protein
aggregates and intracellular pathogens. As such, autophagy plays critical roles in maintaining
organelle quality, preventing the accumulation of protein aggregates and clearing intracellular
pathogens. Therefore, defects in autophagy have been associated with various human diseases,
including cancer, neurodegenerative disease and inflammatory disease. During autophagy, cargo
can be captured via a non-selective or selective mechanism. In selective autophagy, cargos are
identified by selective autophagy receptors (SARs). SARs are either soluble cytosolic proteins
recruited to the cargo upon autophagy initiation or integral membrane proteins embedded in the
organelle membrane that will become a cargo for selective autophagy. While the mechanisms by
which cytosolic SARs initiate selective autophagy have become increasingly clear, the
mechanisms by which integral membrane SARs coordinate with the autophagy machinery to
initiate selective autophagy are still not well understood.
The proposed work will use mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in yeast as a model system to
investigate the mechanisms by which integral membrane SARs coordinate with the autophagy
machinery to initiate selective autophagy. Mitophagy in yeast is an ideal system to study selective
autophagy initiation as yeast have only a single SAR for mitochondria, termed Atg32. In contrast,
mammalian cells have five integral membrane SARs for mitochondria making it more challenging
to interpret knockdown or mutagenesis studies of any individual SARs as other related SARs may
compensate. This proposal will utilize a cross-disciplinary approach combining cell biology, lipid
biochemistry, biochemical reconstitution and structural biology to study mitophagy initiation. The
proposed work will help develop a molecular understanding of the mechanisms of selective
autophagy initiation by integral membrane SARs, provide a starting point for studying other
integral membrane SARs using biochemical approaches and provide novel methods for studying
these systems."

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on chronic dialysis are extremely costly to manage, accounting for
7% of Medicare spending, yet representing 1% of the population. Most of their costs stem from management of
the multiple and severe comorbidities that are highly prevalent in this group, with mortality rates 20-fold higher
than patients of similar age and sex in the general population. To address these issues, Medicare established
in 2015 a model of specialty-oriented accountable care organizations (ACOs), known as ESRD Seamless Care
Organizations (ESCOs). Constituted by dialysis centers and nephrologists, ESCOs accept responsibility for
costs and quality of care of aligned beneficiaries in exchange for potential shared savings. A report on the first
performance year demonstrated $75 million in savings. With promising results to date, the program is being
rapidly expanded. However, much remains unclear about how these savings were achieved and what impact
they will have on clinical outcomes. Not all the ESCOs achieved savings, and there was over six-fold variation
in savings per beneficiary across those that did. There was also substantial variability in performance on
quality measure targets, many of which focused on aspects of routine or preventive care beyond dialysis care.
These variations may, therefore, be plausibly explained by the extent to which ESCOs successfully involve
primary care physicians (PCPs) in the care of their patients–a decision left to the discretion of individual
organizations. PCPs may be particularly effective in the management of this population, given their experience
and expertise with coordination of care, their accessibility, and their generally more holistic view of the patient.
Thus, an ESCO’s success at curbing spending and improving outcomes for its aligned beneficiaries may
depend on its ability to increase interactions between nephrologists and PCPs. Regardless, it remains unclear
whether ESCOs offer any added benefit over older primary care-oriented ACO designs like the Medicare
Shared Savings Program (MSSP), in which 20% of Medicare beneficiaries on chronic dialysis currently receive
their care. We propose a study with the following three Specific Aims: 1) To assess ESCO effects on
interactions among nephrologists and PCPs or other specialists 2) To assess the impact that increased PCP
involvement has on ESCO financial performance and clinical outcomes and 3) To compare the costs and
outcomes of care for chronic dialysis patients as a function of PCP involvement in ESCOs, versus MSSP
ACOs. Findings from this work will provide critical information to guide ongoing efforts at reorganization of
health care for the dialysis population with the goal of improving the efficiency and quality of care delivered."
10767242,"CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) that express the transcription factor FoxP3 cells play key and non-redundant
roles in maintaining immunologic tolerance and controlling inflammation. Treg proportions within CD4+ T cells
are under tight homeostatic control. There is considerable diversity to Treg cells, with differential ability to
control certain immune functions, and even tissue-resident Tregs with extra-immunologic functions. Our recent
recent single-cell RNAseq work has charted these finely, showing that Treg subsets express different effector
molecules. Treg subset structure appears very similar in mouse and humans. We hypothesize that Treg
subsets in lymphoid tissues respond to different homeostatic cues, and that these different inputs condition
specific Treg functions. (1) Our single-cell transcriptomics data, which highlighted the diversity of Treg
subphenotypes in an unbiased fashion, identified some cell surface markers for identification and sorting, but
we will expand this base by performing a combined transcriptome/proteome analysis (scRNAseq combined
with surface protein quantitation by DNA-tagged antibodies - CITE-seq) to identify a panel of flow cytometry
markers that accurately distinguish Treg subphenotypes, in both mouse and human. This will relate this novel
landscape to prior knowledge on Treg subsets, provide biomarkers, and enable cell sorting for functional
experimentation. We will assess the function of Treg subsets in regulating other immunocytes (proliferation and
differentiation), assess their developmental origin and stability (thymic or peripheral, plasticity?), and how they
vary in autoimmune or tumor lesions. (2) IL2 is the canonical controller of Treg cellsbut other common-
cytokines (IL7, 15, 21 and TSLP) and IL33 also affect Tregs. Our results show a strikingly divergent distribution
of cytokine receptors among Treg subsets, suggesting that different growth factors support them. We will use
both gain- (in vivo cytokines administration) or loss-of-function (blocking antibodies) strategies to modify Treg
subset balance, read out by flow cytometry (STAT phosphorylation, Treg subset number and activation) and
scRNAseq. (3) Most members of the large TNF Receptor (TNFR) superfamily are over-expressed in Treg cells,
and some have been shown to affect Treg maintenance and survival, but a comprehensive picture is lacking.
Our data show differential representation of TNFR across Treg subsets. We hypothesize that TNFR molecules
network with cytokine receptors to provide specific trophic signals to distinct Treg subsets. We have developed
a powerful CRISPR-based in vivo screen, based on barcoding stem cells, to evaluate how sets of genes
partake in Treg homeostasis. We will analyze the role of the entire TNFR family on maintenance of different
Treg subsets, at baseline in different lymphoid tissues and after stimulation by trophic cytokines. We will also
test several TNFRs combinatorially, to search for redundancy, complementarity or antagonism. These results
will provide a clarification and deeper understanding of the diversity of Treg populations, their control by
cytokines or surface receptors, and how they might be specifically manipulated for therapeutic intent."

The most advanced malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S, provides only partial efficacy against clinical malaria
episodes when given to young children. Furthermore, efficacy wanes within 12-18 months post vaccination,
with many children having low magnitude and/or rapidly waning immune responses, and booster doses are
only partially efficacious. The immunologic mechanisms underlying sub-optimal and waning immune responses
and vaccine efficacy remain unclear. We propose to utilize a multi-omics, systems biology approach to
define baseline, and vaccine-induced signatures that predict immunogenicity and protection, following
RTS,S vaccination of young children in Malawi. This project will take advantage of an extraordinary
opportunity to comprehensively study baseline and vaccine-induced immune responses to RTS,S in young
children through a collaboration with the Malawi International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research
(ICEMR). The Malawi ICEMR is studying the effectiveness of RTS,S to prevent malaria infection and
transmission in a longitudinal cohort of children as part of a World Health Organization-sponsored
implementation study. By leveraging our well-characterized cohort, detailed immunological characterization of
host responses, and state-of-the-art computational models of immunity, we will in Aim 1 perform a systems
analysis of baseline signatures that predict immunogenicity and protection from primary vaccination
against Pf. We will use a multi-omics approach, using bulk RNA-seq, metabolomics of serum, cytometry by
time of flight with epigenetic profiling (EpiTOF), and single cell epigenetic profiling to profile baseline
signatures prior to primary RTS,S vaccination in 300 Malawian children. Our goal will be to perform an
integrated analysis of these orthogonal datasets to define a baseline signature that can be used to predict the
immunogenicity and efficacy of RTS,S vaccination. In Aim 2, we will perform a systems analysis of
vaccine-induced signatures that predict immunogenicity and protection from primary and booster
vaccination against Pf. We will use a multi-omics approach, using bulk RNA-seq, metabolomics of serum,
multiplex analysis of serum cytokines and CSP-specific T cell assays, to comprehensively profile vaccine-
induced signatures following RTS,S vaccination in Malawian children. We will perform an integrated analysis
of these datasets to define vaccine-induced signatures that can be used to predict the immunogenicity and
efficacy of RTS,S vaccination. The successful completion of these aims will provide deep insight into the
molecular mechanisms underlying suboptimal immunity to RTS,S vaccination, and yield biomarkers of vaccine-
induced immunity and protection."
10767247,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global pandemic with over 26 million people affected worldwide. Critical for
regulation of heart oxygenation and metabolism is the cross-talk between heart endothelial cells (ECs) and
cardiomyocytes (CMs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This cross-talk, mediated by locally acting, bioactive
substances released by cardiac ECs (paracrine function), in particular nitric oxide (NO), controls blood flow
and vascular permeability, as well as CMs' growth, contractility and rhythmicity. However, the mechanisms
underlying the functional interaction between cardiac ECs and CMs and SMCs are still poorly understood.
Our pioneering studies on endothelial functions of the small GTPase (Ras Association Proximate) Rap1
highlight its role as novel regulator of vascular homeostasis. Rap1 is critically required for nitric oxide (NO)
production and bioavailability, as tissue-specific deletion of both Rap1 isoforms (Rap1A and Rap1B) leads to
severe endothelial dysfunction. Emerging data from our collaboration strongly suggest that the two Rap1
isoforms in both coronary (vascular) and heart microcapillary (cardiac) ECs may be essential to preserving
normal contractile function of the heart.
Our data demonstrate that EC-specific deletion of Rap1 leads to decreased cardiac contractility and impending
heart failure. Mechanistically, our preliminary data strongly suggest that, via discrete yet complementary
mechanisms, two Rap1 isoforms are essential for endothelial Ca2+handling and endothelial function (NO
production). The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of the two Rap1 isoforms in coronary and cardiac
ECs required for maintenance of cardiac contractile function. We hypothesize that Rap1-dependent EC
functions form the nexus for EC-SMC and EC- CM communication required for normal cardiac function.
Conversely, Rap1 deficiency-driven EC dysfunction (impaired NO release, Ca2+ overload) is the common
culprit in EC–SMC and EC–CM miscommunication that leads to heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we will:
(1) Determine how Rap1 controls Ca2+ homeostasis in ECs; we will utilize patch clamp electrophysiology and
Ca2+ measurements in vitro to examine the effect of Rap1 deficiency on Ca2+ influx channels. We will examine
the effect of impaired Ca2+ homeostasis in Rap1A KO ECs on cellular processes controlling paracrine function.
(2) Examine a novel signaling pathway involving CalDAG-GEFIII-mediated Rap1B activation in NO release. Ex
vivo, we will test the effect of Rap1 signaling and ion channel inhibition on mouse and human coronary vessel
dilation, to determine the influence of EC Rap1A and Rap1B in the control of coronary vessel blood flow.
(3) Examine vascular and cardiac function in EC-Rap1 knockout mice ex vivo and paracrine function in EC-CM
co-culture in vitro to determine how cardiac EC Rap1 isoforms control heart contractile function.
 Proposed studies will uncover novel, previously unexpected mechanisms governing heart endothelium and
may lead to a new direction in restoring cardiac function by controlling Rap1 signaling in endothelium."

The form of an organ defines its function. How simple epithelial tissues give rise to the complex forms of mature
organs is a fundamental question in developmental biology with important implications in disease and
regenerative medicine. A beautiful example is the remodeling of a simple embryonic epithelium to form the three
semicircular canals (SCC) of the inner ear. Their intricate form is required for sensing balance and acceleration
and is conserved across all jawed vertebrates. SCCs can develop abnormally in congenital syndromes such as
LAMM, CHARGE and Alagille syndrome, for unknown reasons. The mechanisms underlying healthy
development are poorly understood. My preliminary findings indicate that local synthesis of a hyaluronan-rich
extracellular matrix (ECM) is important in SCC development. In the proposed research, I will determine how this
ECM helps generate mechanical forces in SCC morphogenesis in zebrafish (Aim1). I will use next-generation
single-cell sequencing to identify genes involved in the patterning of an active ECM (Aim2) and to identify and
characterize the role of other ECM components involved in SCC development (Aim3). The novel molecular-
mechanical principles revealed from this study will be widely applicable to other morphogenetic events involving
an active ECM and topological epithelial remodeling. Moreover, as these processes are disrupted in many
congenital diseases and ear disorders, my findings will improve our understanding of these diseases.
The proposed research draws on 1) my training in quantitative cell biology in a development context, 2) the new
skills acquired in my post-doctoral research, including zebrafish research and imaging of the developing organ
at single-cell resolution, and 3) my K99 training plan to implement automated image analysis, in vivo biophysical
measurements, modeling, and single-cell sequencing and analysis. To fulfil my aims, I will receive mentorship
from Drs. Sean Megason, Tim Mitchison, L. Mahadevan and Allon Klein, whose combined expertise in zebrafish
development, gene-editing, biophysics, quantitative imaging, modeling and single-cell RNA sequencing will give
me the training I need to commence my independent research program. To facilitate my career development
during the mentored K99 phase, I will take relevant courses and maintain collaborations for both fundamental
and translational research, present my work at meetings, publish my research, write grants, and gain further
experience in management and mentoring students to formulate my own mentoring style. I will greatly benefit
from the experience, track record and regular feedback from my co-mentors to start my own laboratory.
My long-term career goal is to head an inter-disciplinary research program to investigate the mechanical and
molecular basis of morphogenesis and to use the insights I develop to advance translational research. I’ve made
significant progress towards this goal in the form of research experience, successful collaborations and
publications. The K99 award will give me access to the additional training and expertise I need to successfully
transition to independence."

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) controls the motivation to pursue rewards and avoid harmful stimuli. Within
the last decade it has been shown that the VTA is populated by neurons that release the neuromodulator
dopamine, neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and neurons that release the excitatory
neurotransmitter glutamate. Based on the use of optogenetic techniques to manipulate dopamine, GABA, or
glutamate neurons, current models of VTA function postulate that reward and aversion-based motivation is
mediated by heterogeneous types of VTA neurons and their discrete neuronal networks. However, we have
recently discovered an unanticipated type of neuron in the VTA, those that release both glutamate and GABA.
The discovery of the VTA glutamate-GABA neurons redefines the GABA-releasing and glutamate-releasing
VTA cell-types by multiple genetic features: release of glutamate without GABA (glutamate-only neurons),
release of GABA without glutamate (GABA-only neurons), or release of both (glutamate-GABA neurons). While
optogenetic studies have shown roles of glutamate-releasing or GABA-releasing neurons in motivated
behavior, the redefinition of VTA glutamate and GABA-releasing neurons into three subtypes indicates that our
understanding of the VTA cell-type specific roles in motivated behavior is incomplete. We will use novel
intersectional and subtractive genetic and viral tools to identify the neuronal networks and roles in reward- or
aversion-mediated behavior of VTA glutamate-GABA, glutamate-only, and GABA-only neurons and circuits. In
Aim 1, we will comprehensively map the brain-wide inputs and outputs of VTA glutamate-GABA, glutamate-
only, and GABA-only neurons using cell-type specific anterograde tracing and monosynaptic retrograde tracing
with a modified rabies virus. In Aim 2, using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 we will identify
the neuronal activity patterns of VTA glutamate-GABA, glutamate-only, and GABA-only neurons, as well as the
neuronal activity patterns of major afferents that target each genetically separate VTA cell-type, in response to
rewarding and aversive stimuli and their predictors. Finally, we will optogenetically stimulate or inhibit VTA
glutamate-GABA, glutamate-only, and GABA-only neurons and circuits to define their causal contributions
towards motivated behavior. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that VTA glutamate-GABA, glutamate-
only, and GABA-only neurons have distinct neuronal networks and motivational functions. Together, these
studies will comprehensively redefine the motivational functions of VTA neurons and their individual circuits.
Results will provide new directions to alleviate reward and aversion based disorders such as addiction."
