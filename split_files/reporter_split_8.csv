 The global impact of malaria remains staggering despite extensive efforts to eradicate the disease. We
have developed a novel antimalarial acridone chemotype with dual stage efficacy against both liver stage and
blood stage malaria, as well as single-dose cure ability and potential to prevent relapsing infection. The ability
to combat multiple stages of the infection represents a powerful tool, and one ideally suited to achieve the
broadest possible benefit as the malaria eradication effort proceeds. A rigorous optimization process has
produced a series of second-generation acridones with significant improvements in efficacy, metabolic stability,
pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles. Our overarching goal is to develop a novel antimalarial that is safe in
individuals with G6PD deficiency, and in the most vulnerable populations – pregnant women and children, thus
supporting world-wide elimination of the disease. The specific goal of this project is to conduct lead
optimization studies to produce second-generation candidates for full preclinical evaluation that retain the
broad-spectrum features and demonstrate enhanced efficacy, safety, solubility, and metabolic/pharmacokinetic
profiles; to investigate the propensity for drug resistance to selected acridone candidates and identify the
molecular target(s) through whole genome sequencing and analysis; and to explore mode(s) of action for these
liver stage active antimalarial acridones using functional assays and bioanalytical approaches."
10775792,"Project Summary: The ubiquitin pathway in corneal scarring
Scarring in the cornea resulting from injury, trauma, or infection can lead to debilitating opacities and
permanent vision loss. Acute scarring, similar to chronic fibrosis, is characterized by immune cell
infiltration and the persistence of cells termed myofibroblasts. We have found that the deubiquitinase
(DUB) USP10 is a key regulator of scarring pathways in the cornea. Knockdown of USP10 in vivo leads
to a significant reduction in the development of myofibroblasts, cell apoptosis, the presence of CD45+
immune cells, and fibrotic extracellular matrix in a healing wound. We are proposing to test the central
hypothesis that USP10 is a key regulator of myofibroblast persistence in a corneal scar via its multi-
factorial role in wound healing. Specifically, since USP10 is a DUB for αv-integrins and p53, in Specific
Aim 1 we will unravel the complex role of USP10 in integrin recycling and p53 dynamics in primary
human corneal fibroblasts and in mice in vivo. The communication between fibroblasts and
macrophages plays a critical role in scarring outcomes. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop novel 3D and
2.5D hydrogel systems with “tunable stiffness” that mimic a 3D environment close to the stiffness of the
healing cornea. Using these hydrogels, mouse corneal fibroblasts will be cocultured with mouse bone
marrow derived macrophages (M0/M1/M2) to elucidate the role of USP10 in macrophage-mediated
myofibroblast development and contraction. In Specific Aim 3 using three separate mouse models we
will assess the role of USP10 in immune cell infiltration into a corneal wound."
10797008,"We have shown that disruption of the muscle circadian clock mechanism through loss of the core clock gene,
Bmal1, is sufficient to induce significant muscle weakness and surprisingly, increased mortality. Based on
these findings, the overall objective of this grant is to pursue the fundamental understanding of the role of the
muscle circadian clock in regulating a daily program of gene expression and how clock disruption leads to
significant muscle weakness and diminished systemic health.
We found that MyoD1 can modulate expression of the core clock gene, Bmal1 making it a bona fide tissue-
specific circadian clock modifier1. We have also determined that MyoD1 and CLOCK:BMAL1 share peak
binding at over 3000 sites across the muscle genome. These new findings provide support for our studies to
define the mechanism(s) through which MyoD1 modulates the network properties of the clock mechanism as
well as understanding the role of MyoD1 as a clock co-factor in the daily genomic and transcriptomic
landscape in adult muscle.
Downstream from MyoD1 and the clock factors, my lab has identified two muscle specific genes, Rbm20 and
Tcap, that we propose link clock disruption with muscle weakness. Loss of muscle Bmal1, results in significant
decreases in Rbm20 and Tcap expression and we find changes in sarcomere structure including variability of
sarcomere length, distortions in M and Z lines and altered myofilament orientation. Lastly, the global Bmal1
knock out mouse, Bmal1KO, has been used as a model of advanced aging as it exhibits significant aging-like
pathologies and has a median lifespan of 37wks. In preliminary experiments using this global Bmal1 KO
mouse we rescued Bmal1 in skeletal muscles using an AAV vector with a muscle specific promoter. We found
that this was sufficient to significantly improve muscle strength but also significantly extended lifespan. These
are complementary to our findings of increased mortality with loss of muscle Bmal1 and demonstrate that
rescuing Bmal1 only in skeletal muscle improves systemic health. In addition, with aging and many chronic
diseases exhibiting muscle clock disruption, these results suggest that targeting the muscle clock mechanism
holds potential as a translational strategy. We propose to test the following three specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To define the roles of MyoD1 within the core clock mechanism and as a co-factor for the daily
transcriptomic landscape in skeletal muscle.
Specific Aim 2: To test the clock controlled genes, Rbm20 and/or Tcap, for their roles in sarcomere structure
and muscle function.
Specific Aim 3: To determine the skeletal muscle specific changes required for improved lifespan in the Bmal1
KO mouse."
10800699,"As the population has aged, there has been a staggering increase in the prevalence and morbidity of cognitive
impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) related dementias (ADRD): by 2050 the number of people in the U.S.
with ADRD will triple to 13.8 million, and associated health care costs will exceed $1.1 trillion annually.
Combinations of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors appear to increase risk for ADRD through age-
related changes in neuronal processes that lead to progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aß) and tau. While
there is growing recognition that disturbed sleep and circadian disturbances may accelerate Aß accumulation
and cognitive decline, the literature is inconclusive regarding the causal vs non-causal role of specific sleep
disturbances and has not addressed whether nocturnal hypertension (a modifiable target) mediates sleep-related
cognitive outcomes. We will exploit the marked inter-individual variability in many sleep measures, as well as
substantial intra-individual changes over time to develop a longitudinal framework to better approach questions
of causality. We propose to leverage the comprehensive sleep phenotyping performed from 2010-2013 (MESA-
SLEEP; Exam 5), along with ongoing and newly proposed data to be collected in the MESA MIND study, which
includes state-of-the-art cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and brain imaging studies in a sample of MESA participants
studied at 2 time points 2.5 years apart (2019-2023) to efficiently and uniquely address critical research gaps.
While the MESA MIND study addresses the role of mid- and later-life vascular disease as a risk factor for ADRD,
it does not address the potential contributory or mediating roles of sleep and circadian disorders. We therefore
propose to efficiently expand the MESA MIND study second exam (2021-2023) to include overnight state-of-the-
art polysomnography, 7-day actigraphy, and for the first time in MESA, 24-hour blood pressure recordings,
aiming to recruit 1800 of the 2000 participants targeted for that exam. We will generate advanced quantitative
metrics of sleep and circadian rhythm to characterize the evolution of sleep disturbances over critical aging
periods. These measurements will be incorporated into longitudinal assessments of cognition in order to define
the temporal associations between sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment, and thus define which sleep
disturbances and metrics are antecedent factors for cognitive impairment. We will evaluate whether sleep
measured 8 years prior to brain imaging, as well as trajectories of sleep change, predict neurodegeneration,
cerebral vascular disease and AD brain biomarkers as measured by repeated brain MRI and PET imaging
(performed as part of the MESA MIND Study). We also will assess the role of blood pressure variability and
nocturnal hypertension as a mediating pathway linking sleep disturbance and cognition/AD susceptibility. We
will explore differences in associations between men and women and individuals of different race/ethnic
backgrounds. The study has large potential impact given that sleep disturbances and nocturnal hypertension are
modifiable targets. The study also will inform gender-appropriate risk stratification approaches."

 There is a striking disparity in the burden of stroke for several major sociodemographic
groups including race-ethnic minorities, women, people of lower socioeconomic means, rural
dwellers, and those residing in low income countries. The impact of these disparities translates
to huge economic costs for the US. Adding to the sense of urgency is a substantial projected
future widening of stroke prevalence for several of these groups. As a society, we need to have
a better understanding of the causes for these disparities, and test solutions to reduce them, but
too few studies to date have demonstrated substantial reductions in stroke outcome disparities.
Moreover, fostering the successful development of the next generation of stroke disparities
researchers is crucial to resolving this growing challenge. The Health Equity & Actionable
Disparities in Stroke: Understanding & Problem-solving (HEADS-UP) symposium, is a
multidisciplinary forum focused on major disparities in cerebrovascular disease, with the
overarching goal of reducing disparities in stroke and accelerating translation of research
findings to improve outcomes for disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. HEADS-UP 2021-2024
will be held in February of each successive year, featuring plenary talks by distinguished
researchers, career development activities, and poster sessions. HEADS-UP 2021 will focus on
Community Awareness and Stakeholder Engagement. HEADS-UP is a collaborative initiative
with the American Stroke Association (ASA) and will occur a day before the start of the ASA’s
two and half International Stroke Conference, the premier global stroke science meeting, where
> 5000 stroke scientists from all over the world gather to present their research & network.
Involvement of ASA brings to this important effort, wide access to relevant scientific disciplines,
volunteer engagement from leaders in the field, financial support, worthwhile in-kind resources,
and proven experience in implementing high impact programs. Basic scientists, translational
researchers and clinicians, seasoned investigators and early career scientists will be invited, but
a major emphasis is to encourage active involvement of an early career cohort of investigators.
HEADS-UP Specific Aims are: To host a forum which will identify knowledge gaps and provide
opportunities for researchers from diverse disciplines to discuss cutting-edge research about
key disparities in stroke; 2) To accelerate collaborations via networking opportunities among
stakeholders; 3) To award travel scholarships to 20 multidisciplinary Post-Doctoral Scholars
from a national pool from diverse professional backgrounds committed to stroke disparities
research careers; 4) To disseminate knowledge generated from HEADS-UP via scientific &
public venues; 5) To evaluate effectiveness of HEADS-UP by assessing number of attendees,
and Young Awardee Achievements."
10793533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Globally, over 50% of those infected with HIV are women, and annually, ~50% of all pregnancies are unplanned.
Therefore, there is a critical need to promote female-controlled methods of multipurpose prevention technologies
(MPTs) and delivery strategies that can be disassociated from the sex act. Injectable formulations are well
tolerated by men and women, are efficacious for contraception, and have high patient acceptability and
compliance1-4. Innovations recently introduced into the field of systemic PrEP are long-acting (LA) formulations
of antiretrovirals (ARVs) that stably release drugs over many weeks as nano-formulations and have activity in
animal models of prevention5-7 and in humans8-10. Currently, there are two different LA formulations being
considered for HIV prevention: a LA form of rilpivirine (RPV/TMC278) and a LA form of cabotegavir
(CAB/GSK744)9, 11-12. Injections of these LA ARVs requires a 4-week ‘lead-in’ regimen using oral cabotegravir or
rilpivirine to fulfil current safety considerations as once injected these agents have detectable levels for months
and the drug cannot be removed or have its clearance accelerated. Despite these advances in HIV PrEP,
currently there are no LA injectable MPT formulations in development mainly because of limitations of current
LA injectable formulations utilizing nanoparticle suspensions whereby two drugs cannot be combined into a
single injection. In this R01 grant and building on our existing data, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of
a first-in-line injectable MPT that offers durable and sustained protection from HIV transmission, high efficacy of
contraception, increased user compliance, and the ability to be removed in case of unanticipated adverse events
or when considering discontinuation from the LA HIV PrEP and/or contraception. We will achieve this goal by
developing a liquid MPT formulation utilizing excipients that form a biodegradable depot after subcutaneous
injection (in-situ forming implant (ISFI)). We propose a comprehensive evaluation of this novel drug delivery
approach using a highly relevant macaque model of mucosal simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) as
an invaluable preclinical tool to assess the efficacy of the ISFI against SHIV acquisition. This cutting-edge
combined approach will be utilized to evaluate the scientific premise of our proposal to investigate whether
sustained protection against HIV acquisition and pregnancy can be achieved using a unique and highly
innovative ultra-long-acting coitally-independent MPT ISFI formulation."
10710383,"Dr. Patten's research focuses on understanding the neural basis of human movement. The overarching goal
of her translational research is to improve the quality of clinical neurorehabilitation through development of
effective, efficient, targeted interventions that promote recovery of neuromotor function. Informed by extensive
clinical experience as a physical therapist, her research bridges the fields of neurorehabilitation,
neuromechanics, and neuroengineering to conduct quantitative, mechanistic investigation with three related
objectives: 1) elucidating mechanisms of movement dysfunction with aging and in adult neuropathologies; 2)
determining capacity for motor recovery following central nervous system injury; and 3) identifying critical
factors that contribute to rehabilitation efficacy. To achieve these goals, the programmatic lines of her
research investigate: a) neural mechanisms and biomechanical consequences of CNS pathologies causing
motor dysfunction, b) development of biomarkers of motor recovery, and c) novel means to induce
neuroplasticity and motor recovery. Dr. Patten's research influences clinical care in neurorehabilitation, thus
helps individuals with motor dysfunction resulting from neuropathologies, such as stroke, maximize recovery,
restore activity participation, and optimize quality of life.
Dr. Patten has studied adults with stroke-related motor dysfunction for over 20 years. She has been the
Principal Investigator for four VA-RRD supported clinical trials investigating effects and response to
rehabilitation interventions for persons post-stroke [VA RRD B2450R, VA RRD B29792R, VA RRD B3964R,
VA RRD B540231]. Results of these studies have been influential for the field and have been incorporated into
clinical practice guidelines and recommendations such as the Evidence-based Review of Stroke Rehabilitation.
Observation of responders and non-responders to therapeutic intervention —without baseline differences in
clinical characteristics— motivated investigation of intrinsic physiological differences among these sub-groups,
for which she conducted in cross-sectional studies of chronic stroke survivors (VA RR&D 1I21RX-1435-0]).
This work motivated a subsequent VA RR&D Merit Review (I01RX001677), which she currently conducts as
PI, to examine plantarflexor corticospinal efficacy as a potential biomarker for walking recovery. Additionally,
she is the Site PI for a multi-site study (R01NR015591) tracking biomarkers of stress and genetic variation
collected in the acute period following stroke to determine how these may inform heterogeneity in response to
rehabilitation. She also collaborates, as a Co-I (1R01AG054621-01) on studies using high-density EEG to
understand brain dynamics in elders in response to perturbations during locomotion. Finally, a new study
supported by the NSF (M3X, #1935501) will enable deeper understanding of the process of human motor
learning, plasticity, and transfer to behavioral, neuromechanical effects.
The current application is for renewal of Research Career Scientist support to Dr. Carolynn Patten, a non-
clinician Investigator, with over 20 years of uninterrupted research support through the VA Rehabilitation R&D
service. Dr. Patten is dual-appointed (5/8 VA) between VA Northern California Health Care System
(VANCHCS) and University of California, Davis, where she is a Professor (tenured) in the Departments of
Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (School of Medicine) and Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior (College of
Biological Sciences). In July 2018 Dr. Patten transitioned to her current position at UC Davis and VANCHCS
from Malcom Randall VA Medical Center (Gainesville, FL) and VA Brain Rehabilitation Research Center
(BRRC) where she was dual-appointed between MRVAMC / BRRC (6.6/8 VA) and University of Florida where
she held the rank of Professor (tenured) in the Department of Physical Therapy. Dr. Patten was recognized as
a University of Florida Research Foundation Professor in 2015 and was inducted as Catherine Worthingham

10767773,"The precise regulation of the body's phosphate homeostasis is a critical task. Treatment of
hyperphosphatemia, which becomes inevitable in later stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD),
is limited to dietary phosphate restriction and oral phosphate binders. Two transport proteins
mediate renal phosphate reabsorption, the sodium-phosphate cotransporters Npt2a and Npt2c.
The former mediates the majority of renal phosphate reabsorption (70-80%), which is a
hormonally regulated process and requires parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth
factor 23 (FGF23). No renal phosphate transport protein has become a pharmacological target
yet. We identified that pharmacological inhibition of Npt2a, via a novel orally absorbable Npt2a
inhibitor, causes dose-dependent phosphaturia, reductions in plasma phosphate levels and
suppression of PTH, but also increases urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and calcium,
without affecting urinary potassium excretion, flow rate or pH. These studies show for the first
time that a novel Npt2a inhibitor has therapeutic potential in conditions associated with
hyperphosphatemia and possibly hyperparathyroidism. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the
pharmacological role of Npt2a inhibition in vivo and ex vivo under control conditions and when
animals are challenged by low and high dietary phosphate intake. In Specific Aim 2, we will
determine if Npt2a inhibition is a possible treatment option for conditions with impaired
phosphate homeostasis and hyperparathyroidism. We will employ (i) adenine-induced CKD and
(ii) 5/6th nephrectomy models. Both models show reduced glomerular filtration rate,
hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, elevated plasma FGF23 levels and hypertension. In
Specific Aim 3, we will determine the consequences of renal Npt2a inhibition on intestinal
phosphate transport under physiological and pathophysiological conditions (CKD). Since
pharmacological Npt2a inhibition and its role for phosphate homeostasis has never been studied
before, the results from these studies will be of significant clinical importance because they will:
(i) determine pharmacodynamic effects of Npt2a inhibition, (ii) provide insight if targeting Npt2a
in CKD can chronically lower plasma phosphate and PTH levels, and (iii) provide insight if Npt2a
inhibition can lower blood pressure. This treatment has the potential to improve the quality of life
in veterans possibly by improving phosphate homeostasis and reducing cardiovascular mortality."
10757030,"Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a rare, genetic disorder caused by impaired stimulatory G protein (Gsα) signaling through downregulation of the gene, GNAS. The resultant hormone abnormalities can be treated with hormone replacement therapy, but other aspects of the disorder such as early-onset obesity and short stature are without effective treatment options. Gsα signaling is essential for the normal hormonal function of the pituitary, thyroid, gonads, renal proximal tubules and hypothalamus. While many of the resulting hormone deficiencies can be treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), HRT is not an effective therapy for the severe early-onset obesity and short stature which are major features of the PHP phenotype. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of upstream therapy aimed at correcting the function of Gsα-dependent receptors in children with PHP. Gsα-coupled receptor signaling cascade begins with an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which is rapidly degraded by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE). PDE inhibitors act by prolonging cAMP signaling by decreasing the rate of degradation. Given that patients with PHP have reduced, but not completely absent, cAMP production, we seek to test the hypothesis that the PDE inhibitor theophylline will reduce body mass index (BMI), slow the rate of epiphyseal closure, and decrease hormone resistance in children with PHP through improved Gsα-coupled receptor signaling. We will conduct a 52-week randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of theophylline in children with PHP. Theophylline is a non-selective PDE inhibitor that is generically available and has a long history of use in pediatric patients, making it an ideal drug for repurposing in youth with PHP. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of theophylline are well understood, and serum drug levels are easily measured. Our primary outcome is change in BMI. Secondary outcome measures include change in epiphyseal closure and HRT medication doses. In this revised proposal, we have included additional safety and efficacy data from adults in adolescents treated with theophylline. In response to reviewer comments, we have added an open-label extension period of up to 2 years in order to better evaluate long-term safety and efficacy."
10904624,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Persistent bloodstream infections are life-threatening infectious disease emergencies posing significant challenges
to effective treatment. Such infections occur when a pathogen is susceptible to an anti-infective agent in vitro but is not
cleared from the bloodstream in vivo when that anti-infective agent is used appropriately. As a result, anti-infective usage
increases, accelerating alarming increases in anti-infective resistance. This vicious cycle of persistence driving anti-
infective escalation driving resistance is an NIH high–priority concern. Bloodstream infections caused by
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) or Candida albicans (CA) are increasingly common. Of urgent concern, up to 35% of
patients with methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) persistent bacteremia succumb even on gold-standard therapy. Likewise,
in patients with hematogenously disseminated candidiasis (HDC), mortality is 39% overall and 47% in those in the
intensive care unit, despite appropriate treatment. A disease mystery is central to such infections: the causative
pathogen is susceptible to antimicrobials in laboratory testing—but not in the human being. Importantly, persistence
reflects a unique type of treatment-refractory infections distinct from classical antibiotic resistance. Rather, persistent
MRSA or CA are elusive: they adapt to host immune responses and antibiotic stresses uniquely in vivo and then revert
quickly in vitro. Presently, there are few therapeutic options for persistent MRSA or CA bloodstream infections. Hence,
there is a critical, unmet need to understand the unique interactions of the human, pathogen and therapeutic factors
driving persistence outcomes.
 Based on our extensive preliminary data, we believe that persistent infections caused by MRSA and CA result from
a three-way interaction of the pathogen, host immune response and antimicrobial agent in vivo. We hypothesize that
persistent isolates: 1) have specific epigenomes to enable persistence; 2) subvert innate immune programming
and memory for immune evasion; 3) evoke non-protective or maladaptive immune responses; and 4) exploit
contextual immunity as persistence reservoirs. We further posit that conventional approaches to study this clinically
urgent phenomenon are insufficient to understand it. We have developed three independent but synergistic research
Projects to overcome these limitations. Each Project brings proven strengths and innovative approaches to bear on
Specific Aims that synergize via a systems-based approach supported by outstanding technology, bioinformatics and
computational Cores. Here, we will use state-of-the-art technologies to comprehensively analyze the genetics and
epigenetics of pathogens and the host immune system in context of antimicrobial therapy in laboratory studies and
experimental models of infection. In turn, these data will be analyzed using powerful bioinformatics and computational
methods to detect hidden patterns within large complex datasets. By understanding these factors and their interactions,
new approaches to identify and treat high risk patients can be developed and applied to improve and save lives. These
goals are ideally aligned with priorities of the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control & Prevention."

10755658,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a class of enzymes ubiquitously expressed in the human body,
and they play a critical role in a broad range of physiological processes, including regulation of the immune
system, cardiovascular function, metabolism, reproduction, neurobiological processes of learning and memory,
and vision. PDEs function enzymatically to hydrolyze intracellular cyclic nucleotide second messengers (cAMP
and cGMP), thereby affecting various downstream cellular signaling pathways that control homeostatic
processes. These include repair mechanisms that promote cell survival (somatic maintenance), as well as pro-
apoptotic mechanisms that result in cell death. In aging and disease, dysregulation of these signaling networks
can lead to a reduced investment in somatic maintenance, resulting in pathophysiological states of disease.
However, as key regulatory nodes that modulate intracellular and subcellular concentrations of second
messenger signaling molecules, it is conceivable that PDEs could be pharmacologically targeted in order to
upregulate pathways that improve cellular viability in disease states. By integrating recent advances in PDE
biology with high-throughput methods, this proposal aims to identify new PDE-targeting agents and further
characterize the pathways through which they alleviate pathophysiology in chronic, debilitating disease.
Specifically, our focus will be on the application of newly identified therapeutic agents to ameliorating disease in
a mouse model of retinal degeneration. Our long-term goal is to obtain a better understanding of the role played
by PDE-dependent signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration and to develop interventions
that stop the progression of human blinding diseases.
Accordingly, we propose three thematically and experimentally linked Specific Aims, to: 1) identify novel PDE-
modulating compounds through in silico screening, 2) evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of PDE-selective
inhibitors in preventing retinal degeneration, and 3) validate a systems pharmacology approach to optimizing
PDE inhibitor therapy. Successful completion of Aim 1 will result in the discovery of novel compounds that
circumvent the limitations of existing PDE inhibitors and exhibit superior targeting selectivity with enhanced
potential for clinical utility. Through completion of Aim 2, we intend to demonstrate a statistically significant
therapeutic effect conferred by PDE inhibition that is robustly conserved across different mouse models of retinal
degeneration. Lastly, successful completion of Aim 3 will dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms of
cytoprotection in the context of stress-induced retinal degeneration, thereby providing innovative systems biology
insights on the synergism between intersecting networks involving crosstalk among the many different cell types
in the retina. Indeed, these insights will facilitate a more unified perspective to attain our long-term goal of
developing new and improved pharmaceutical interventions to combat human blindness."
10759375,"This is a K01 award application for Dr. Jacqueline Eaton, a gerontologist and young investigator pursuing
transdisciplinary research on enhancing the quality of life of older adults and their caregivers through arts-
based interventions. A K01 award will provide her with the means to acquire critical skills in four key career
development areas: 1) behavioral intervention research using the NIH Stage Model; 2) Alzheimer’s Disease
and related dementias (ADRD); 3) applied multilevel growth modeling; and 4) interdisciplinary team leadership
and management skills for intervention research. By gaining these skills, Dr. Eaton will fulfill her career goal of
becoming an independent academic investigator and national leader in arts-based intervention research
focused on ADRD caregivers. Supporting this goal, Dr. Eaton has assembled the mentoring team of Drs. Lee
Ellington (Primary Mentor), a research psychologist who leads complex, multi-site clinical caregiver studies,
and Julene Johnson (Co-Mentor), a cognitive neuroscientist with expertise in developing arts-based
interventions for older adults. She has also assembled a three person Advisory Committee with expertise in the
NIH Stage Model, ADRD caregiving, and multilevel growth modeling.
 It is estimated that by 2050, 13.8 million Americans will be living with dementia and up to 90% will
experience behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, combativeness, and depression. Behavioral symptoms
are associated with greater stress for caregivers, which leads to poor health, decreased quality of life, and
increased burden. There is a need to find effective interventions to address the negative effects of behavioral
symptoms. This proposal focuses on developing and testing the Enhancing Active Caregiver Training (EnACT)
to help caregivers better manage the common behavioral symptoms associated with ADRD. Using the NIH
Stage Model, we will create (Stage 1a) and conduct preliminary testing (Stage 1b) of these techniques in a
group intervention. By pursuing the following specific aims, Dr. Eaton will develop and test EnACT to prepare
for a stage 3 clinical trial (to be proposed in an R01 application during the K01 award period). Specific Aim 1
will develop and iteratively refine the EnACT intervention for ADRD caregivers. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate
the feasibility and acceptability of the EnACT intervention. Specific Aim 3 will examine potential mechanisms
of change over time and their subsequent impact on proximal and distal outcomes.
 There is a rise in the number of caregivers required to give optimal support to an aging population that will
have a greater need for, and impact on, local and national resources. Dr. Eaton’s proposed research is
significant because effective evidence-based interventions require systematic approaches to enhance active
caregiver training which has been shown to improve outcomes for ADRD caregivers. The proposed research is
innovative because it combines techniques from a variety of disciplines to increase engagement and enhance
our understanding of mechanisms of action within caregiver interventions."
10773034,"Project Summary
Identification of molecular pathways that are preferentially employed and relied upon by cancer cells compared
to normal cells is key to designing novel personalized cancer therapies. PARP10 is a poorly characterized
member of the PARP family. We previously showed that PARP10 promotes translesion synthesis (TLS)-
mediated bypass of DNA lesions during DNA replication, thereby alleviating replication stress. More recently,
we also showed that PARP10 is a novel oncogene. We found that the PARP10 gene is amplified and/or
overexpressed in a large number of tumors including breast and ovarian, with very few observed occurrences
of downregulation or loss. We found that the PARP10 gene is amplified and/or overexpressed in a large
proportion of human tumors including breast and ovarian, with almost no occurrences of downregulation or
loss. Moreover, we found that PARP10 overexpression in, non-transformed human epithelial RPE1 cells
results in enhanced proliferation, resistance to replication stress, and increased xenograft tumor formation in
immunocompromised mice. The opposing phenotypes were found upon knockout of PARP10 in cancer HeLa
cells. These findings suggest that PARP10 is a putative oncogene and its expression promotes tumor
formation and growth. Mutagenic TLS has been previously proposed to promote transformation by both
allowing hyper-proliferation and inducing genomic instability. Thus, we hypothesize that PARP10 expression
suppresses replication stress through TLS-mediated bypass of replication arresting structures, thereby
allowing hyper-proliferation of cancer cells. We propose here to directly test this, in three specific aims which
address the hypothesis at three different levels: Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism employed by PARP10 to
modulate PCNA-dependent TLS at the molecular level, using biochemical and cellular localization and
interaction assays. Aim 2 will functionally test the impact of this mechanism of cellular processes including
genomic stability and DNA replication. Aim 3 will employ a mouse genetic model to unambiguously investigate
if Parp10 expression induces tumor formation or promotes tumor growth. Using state-of-the-art cellular,
molecular and genomic tools (including: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing; molecular DNA fiber
combing to measure fork stability; next generation sequencing approaches to measure mutagenesis and
mutation burden) we will investigate here the molecular mechanisms underlying this novel oncogenic function
of PARP10. This may eventually result in validation of a new target for cancer therapy."
10763822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The U.S. service sector employs 27 million workers, 20% of the U.S. workforce. Abetted by new technologies,
employers in the service sector have embraced surveillance and sanctioning, which affect time and pace of tasks
on the job, unpredictable and constrained scheduling practices, which affect the organization of time on and off
work, and automation, which shapes longer-term expectations for the future and job insecurity. We refer to these
working conditions, collectively, as temporal dimensions of job quality to draw a contrast with purely economic
dimensions of job quality. Although prior research has established a robust relationship between other aspects
of job conditions and health, there is a gap in knowledge about how these new and increasingly prevalent
workplace practices affect worker health and healthy aging. One important reason for this gap is a lack of suitable
existing data containing information on both these emergent workplace practices and workers’ health outcomes,
yet policy makers have already begun to take action to regulate these practices. There is thus a critical need to
collect new data that will allow researchers to estimate the health effects of exposure to these temporal
dimensions of job quality for workers across the life course. The proposed research expands upon an innovative
method for collecting survey data at scale, at low-cost, and with speed from a target population of service-sector
workers. We use the Facebook advertising platform to purchase and place survey recruitment advertisements
in the mobile and desktop newsfeeds of Facebook and Instagram users, targeting those who work in retail and
fast food. This approach allows us to target users with particular employers and/or in specific localities. We
propose to collect repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data from 90,000 workers across the country.
The proposed research uses these data and methods to accomplish three aims. First, we estimate the
relationship between emergent temporal dimensions of job quality and worker health and healthy aging. The
data collection is designed to capitalize on natural experiments to provide rigorous evidence on the health effects
of temporally precarious work. One set of analyses will exploit city and company policy changes to use rigorous
difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods to estimate causal effects of job quality on health.
Second, we assess whether the health consequences of surveillance and sanctioning, schedule unpredictability
and constraint, and automation vary across the life course. Finally, we will assess the social and public supports
that may buffer and mitigate the harmful health effects of these temporal dimensions of job quality. In sum, we
deploy an innovative data collection approach combined with rigorous estimation to take advantage of natural
experiments implemented when labor laws or company practices change. The significant contributions of our
project entail testing how new dimensions of job quality affect health, estimating differential vulnerabilities across
the life course, and gauging the importance of protective supports and policies. Collectively, this research
provides key missing evidence on health impacts of job quality."

 Despite the existence of various therapeutic approaches, chemotherapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment.
Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, a multitargeted antifolate that inhibits folate metabolism, is extensively used
to treat non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which is the most common type of lung cancer. However,
patients often relapse due to the development of resistance, leading to therapeutic failure. Many studies have
investigated possible chemoresistance models, yet the precise mechanism is still largely elusive.
 Oncogenic kinases are well implicated in human cancers and of great clinical interest due to their role in
cancer. To better understand the link between kinase-mediated metabolic regulation and pemetrexed resistance,
we performed a customized RNAi screen to identify a clinically applicable target kinase that is critical for
pemetrexed resistance. We found that inhibition of one of the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) family,
FGFR3, selectively sensitizes NSCLC cells to pemetrexed, leading to decreased cancer cell survival and
proliferation. Coupled kinase and metabolic assays revealed that FGFR3 may indirectly activate one of the
pemetrexed target enzymes, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in the folate metabolism. Furthermore, global
proteome profiling and phospho-signaling array suggested that FGFR3 may be involved in regulating expression
or activity of factors in the MAPK pathway including KSR2 and RSK1/2. These suggest that FGFR may provide
pemetrexed resistance through modulating folate metabolism and MAPK pathway and is a promising therapeutic
target to improve the pemetrexed response. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of FGFR3 significantly sensitized
pemetrexed-resistant NSCLC cell lines to pemetrexed treatment in vitro and in vivo.
 Our central hypothesis is that FGFR3 confers pemetrexed resistance in NSCLC by regulating the metabolic
enzyme DHFR and MAPK pathway. Therefore, FGFR3 inhibitors may represent potent pemetrexed sensitizing
agents in NSCLC. Two specific aims are proposed: (1) To decipher the molecular mechanism underlying FGFR3-
mediated activation of folate metabolism and MAPK pathway, which confers pemetrexed resistance in NSCLC;
(2) To validate FGFR3 signaling as a therapeutic target in treatment of pemetrexed-resistant NSCLC using
various NSCLC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of lung cancer. This
proposal will not only provide information about the role of FGFR3 in pemetrexed resistance but also a new
actionable approach to improve the treatment outcome of lung cancer that is not responsive to pemetrexed-
based chemotherapy."

 Myotonic dystrophy type-1 (DM1) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults. The genetic
basis is an expansion of CTG repeats in the non-coding region of DMPK, the gene encoding DM protein kinase.
Individuals with myotonic dystrophy develop progressive muscle weakness, early cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias,
and other symptoms. The disease mechanism involves a deleterious gain-of-function by the mutant DMPK
mRNA, a process first described in DM1, known as RNA toxicity. RNA binding proteins become trapped on
repetitive RNA, causing loss of splicing regulatory functions. Splicing changes contribute to DM1 symptoms and
also may serve as biomarkers of disease severity.
 The discovery that DM1 is instigated by toxicity of one RNA species and characterized by misregulated
splicing of other RNAs has furnished good therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers. Several therapeutic
approaches are under development and two are in early phase clinical trials. However, the design and conduct
of clinical trials is limited by disease heterogeneity, scarcity of natural history data, and the lack of proven clinical
endpoints or biomarkers of drug impact. We have begun a natural history study to define clinical endpoints,
biomarkers, and patient characteristics for clinical trials. This study, END-DM1, has enrolled 277 participants but
early progress was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The current renewal application seeks to complete the study of clinical outcome assessments (Aim 1)
and biomarkers (Aim 2) in DM1. We will complete enrollment of 700 adults with DM1 at 16 sites of the Myotonic
Dystrophy Clinical Research Network with return visits at 12 and 24 months. Based on preliminary data, we
selected a concise set of clinical measures showing acceptable reliability and responsivity to disease
progression. The proposed study is designed to establish minimal clinically important differences for different
measures in this population, identify baseline characteristics that predict future progression, and provide a
rational basis for stratification, selection of sample size, or enrichment in future trials. Aim 2 will build on our
previous efforts to develop RNA splicing biomarkers of DM1 severity and therapeutic response. This Aim is
focused on tissue biomarkers that provide direct evidence of target engagement in skeletal muscle. We will
assess a panel of DM1-affected splice events using a novel method that involves targeted high-throughput
sequencing. Completion of this study is the logical next step to lay the groundwork for effective clinical trials in
DM1, and keep pace with the rapidly expanding preclinical efforts to develop an effective drug treatment."
10804643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Psychosis typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood, which is a vital stage in social and
cognitive development, and can therefore have a profoundly adverse impact on an individual’s long-term
functioning. The onset of psychosis is preceded by a clinical high risk (CHR) phase characterized by
attenuated psychotic symptoms and functional decline. CHR programs have enormous potential to reduce the
long-term severity of the illness, and the suffering and cost associated with it. Youth at CHR also typically have
environmental and individual-level barriers to accessing and engaging in services, including stigma, a dearth of
trained providers, clinic location and transportation issues, suspiciousness, and a tendency to socially isolate.
Reducing some of these barriers via telehealth interventions may improve treatment accessibility and
engagement, thereby improving clinical outcomes. There is a substantial need to evaluate the feasibility of
different CHR interventions to determine which may be most promising and for whom. There is also a
significant need to systematically investigate remote delivery methods as a way of increasing access to critical
services for CHR. We have established a comprehensive Group and Family-Based Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (GF-CBT) program for youth at CHR. GF-CBT aims to facilitate psychosocial recovery, decrease
symptoms, and prevent or delay transition to psychosis in youth at CHR. GF-CBT is grounded in sociocultural
ecological systems theory, psychosocial resilience models, and research on information processing in
delusions. GF-CBT has been implemented as part of SAMHSA funded CHR services in New York, Missouri,
and Delaware and has been adapted for telehealth delivery (GF-CBT-TH). This study will evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of GF-CBT-TH and gather data on the preliminary efficacy of GF-CBT-TH
compared to individual CBT for CHR delivered via telehealth (I-CBT-TH). Subjects between the ages of 14 and
25 who meet CHR criteria on the SIPS (n=60) and their families will be randomly assigned to receive GF-CBT-
TH or I-CBT-TH for a period of 15 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month
follow-up. Feasibility of GF-CBT-TH will be measured by recruitment rate, session attendance, dropout rate,
and subjects’ satisfaction with the interventions. The following intervention targets will be assessed in both
groups: cognitive biases, social connectedness, family emotional climate, and family members’ proficiency in CBT
and communication skills at post-treatment and follow-up. The GF-CBT-TH and I-CBT-TH groups will be
compared across the following domains: psychosocial functioning, symptom severity, rates of remission from
CHR, and rates of transition to psychosis. We will also explore whether patient treatment preference (for GF-
CBT-TH vs. I-CBT-TH), family emotional climate and sociodemographic factors will differentially moderate
treatment outcomes. In depth qualitative interviews will be conducted with patients, families, and clinicians to
inform dissemination of GF-CBT-TH and make adaptations to the implementation manuals as needed."
10734795,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the etiological agent of Q fever. Inside the host cell,
the bacterium survives in a phagolysosome-like vacuole called the Coxiella Containing Vacuole (CCV). Coxiella
is uniquely sensitive to host cholesterol levels, where elevated cholesterol, especially in the CCV and
endolysosomal system, leads to bacterial death. While Coxiella directly regulates host cholesterol homeostasis
through effector proteins secreted by the Coxiella Type 4B Secretory System (T4BSS), the T4BSS effector
proteins responsible for manipulating host cell cholesterol have not yet been identified. Using a bioinformatic
approach, we identified a new family of Coxiella T4BSS effector proteins which contain a eukaryotic FFAT motif.
In eukaryotic cells, FFAT proteins bind to the VAP protein family on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediate
membrane contact sites (MCS) between cell organelles and ER. These inter-organelle MCS play a critical role
in regulating lipid homeostasis. The proposed experiments will test our hypothesis that Coxiella FFAT-containing
T4BSS effector proteins mediate MCS between the ER and other host organelles in order to manipulate host
cholesterol metabolism. Aim 1 will establish which members of the Coxiella FFAT protein family bind to VAP
proteins, and determine where these proteins localize in the host cell. Aim 2 will test whether these proteins are
essential for Coxiella infection, as well as whether they function in modulating host cholesterol. Completion of
these studies will not only reveal a new strategy utilized by Coxiella to modulate host lipid metabolism, but
significantly add to our knowledge on how pathogen-secreted proteins manipulate the host cell."
10817668,"We discovered that Nε-lysine acetylation occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in 2007. From that initial finding, we went on to discover the entire ER acetylation machinery (one membrane transporter, AT-1/SLC33A1, and two acetyltranferases, ATase1 and ATase2) and uncover a novel piece of ER biology. Specifically, we discovered that the ER acetylation machinery regulates proteostasis within the secretory pathway as well as metabolic crosstalk between different intracellular organelles and compartments. Human-based studies discovered that dysfunctional ER acetylation, as caused by loss-of-function homozygous and heterozygous mutations or gene duplication events, is associated with different human diseases, from developmental delay of the brain and premature death to peripheral forms of neuropathy, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and segmental progeria. Mouse models that mimic these genetic events recapitulate associated human diseases. Importantly, ATase-targeting compounds that restore the proteostatic functions of the ER rescue the disease phenotypes of the animals. 
In conclusion, we have identified a novel molecular machinery that is key to the maintenance of proteostasis within the secretory pathway, and that can be targeted to (i) understand the pathophysiology of several related neurological diseases and (ii) develop appropriate translational approaches to resolve proteostatic defects. The GENERAL HYPOTHESIS of this research is that ATase1 and ATase2 act downstream of an intracellular communication network that regulates the proteostatic functions of the ER and secretory pathway. Our main goal is to dissect the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity of the ATases and understand how ER-based acetylation regulates the efficiency of the secretory pathway. 
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the ATases have divergent functions and differentially regulate proteostasis and metabolic crosstalk. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that unique structural features allow the ATases to respond to acetyl-CoA influx, Ca++ levels, and perturbations in ER proteostasis. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the acetyl group added in the ER lumen by the ATases must be removed in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus by Amfion/GDAC to ensure correct trafficking of nascent glycoproteins and the quality of the secretome. 
In conclusion, this proposal is based on novel findings from our laboratory and offers a series of highly mechanistic studies that have the potential to define new avenues of research (and treatment) for different neurological diseases. The proposal will use unique mouse models as well as highly integrated novel experimental approaches. We believe that upon completion of these studies, we will have defined an entirely new avenue of research for different neurological diseases."
10798121,"The aim of this training program is to foster the development of medical students into physician-scientists that
positively impact human health through rigorous investigation of pathways that can be exploited to treat or cure
cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematology and sleep diseases. The Iowa Medical Student Research Program
(IMSRP) achieves this transformative goal by leveraging institutional strengths in student recruitment and
interdepartmental collaboration to create immersive mentored research opportunities. This training grant
proposal seeks funding for 16 students to participate in a 12-week summer fellowship in a heart, lung, blood or
sleep-related research project between their first two years of medical school. Students will work with one of
the 66 enthusiastic and experienced mentors listed on our curated roster of Participating Faculty to draft and
submit a proposal which is then expertly reviewed by two members of the College of Medicine’s research
committee. Outstanding submissions with strong mentorship plans and a clear pathway to presentation and
publication are selected by the Research Council for funding. The funds provided through this training grant
would be matched by the Carver College of Medicine, amplifying the impact of the award. Program leadership
will fully onboard students and monitor their progress closely. In synergy with extensive opportunities provided
through relevant Centers and Institutes of excellence, scholars will receive Instruction in Methods for
Enhancing Reproducibility and the Responsible Conduct of Research, as well as mentor-guided journal clubs
and research seminars. The summer fellowship will be followed by a Medical Student Research Conference
and surveys of all participants to allow ongoing program evolution. In the years that follow, students are
strongly encouraged to enroll in the IMSRP’s research skills course, year-long research opportunities, the
Research Distinction Track, and dual degree programs. At every stage, full participation by students from
groups that are underrepresented in medicine is encouraged through mechanisms that have demonstrated
their utility in both recruitment and retention. We monitor students alongside their mentors as they continue
their pathway towards a research career with incremental advancement through the continuity of support that
is available at our institution, including funding during residency, fellowship, and junior faculty appointments.
Challenging ourselves and our students to make meaningful change at every opportunity, we critically evaluate
our program each year, and use a combination of formative feedback and self-reflection to enhance the
breadth and depth of a program that is designed to fully expose students to the entire research process, from
writing a proposal to analyzing data, presenting at local and national meetings, and ultimately disseminating
the results in peer reviewed journals. The long-term impact of this program is the nationwide dissemination of
a diverse cadre of physicians, who developed an appreciation for team-based science early in their career, and
are equipped to make discoveries and evidence-based decisions that will improve public health."
10806165,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Natural products have long held societal value as folk medicines, and even in this modern era,
many FDA-approved drugs are still being derived from terpenes and alkaloids found in nature.
Biomedical research has also benefited from natural products, as previously unknown
mechanisms of action have been discovered while studying the unique biochemical pathways
that these compounds undergo in the human body. Furthermore, endeavors in the total synthesis
of these architecturally diverse compounds have continuously provided chemists with challenges,
which in turn have led to the establishment of research programs in both academic and industrial
environments. Ever since its inception, our laboratory has been pursuing, and has succeeded in,
the total synthesis of iconic natural products in both the terpene and alkaloid families. These
syntheses have identified gaps in the chemical literature, which we have subsequently addressed.
The products of this research program—new synthetic strategies, unprecedented transformations
and novel reagents—have in turn enabled the synthesis of even more natural products and
pharmaceutically relevant motifs, thus completing a catalytic cycle of discovery. We seek to
replicate this success with the current proposal: the described projects will target complex natural
products to identify shortcomings in chemical methodology, while simultaneously devising
methods of widespread interest, followed by the assessment of their practicality in the synthesis
of complex molecules. For the next five years our laboratory will generate chemical knowledge
that transcends the original objective of natural product synthesis. We will focus on efficiently
synthesize complex natural products aiming for ideality. We will also develop of useful methods
for synthesis and medicinal chemistry. The resulting procedures will be utilized in the construction
of complex pharmaceutical motifs, which will serve to expand chemical space and accelerate
discovery in drug discovery. Notably, we have already established numerous collaborations to
study the biological properties of the products that will be synthesized, to validate and field-test
new methods, and to commercialize reagents for widespread adoption in both academic and
industrial settings. Lastly, we will focus on strategic applications and development of synthetic
organic electrochemical methods, wherein the development of oxidative mediators for C-H
functionalization, desaturation of carbonyls, and reductive cross-couplings are presented."

 Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost.
Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed
along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in
expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course
of depression.
 In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying
disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify
subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of
availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to
clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large
electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard
approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.
 The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in
prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support
yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without
sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates
identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of
individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from
two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD
subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as
interpretability by clinicians.
 The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder
phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records,
and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable
models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk
stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders."
10789883,"Resident between the muscle walls of the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the enteric nervous system
(ENS) consists of a series of interconnected neurons and glia, numbered in the hundreds of millions. The
ENS controls essential gut functions, such as peristalsis, water balance and intestinal barrier homeostasis.
The ENS is derived from enteric neural progenitors (ENPs) that migrate into the developing gut tube during
embryogenesis and differentiate into enteric neurons or glia. Disruption in ENS formation results in the
congenital condition Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), in which variable regions of the GI lack ENS—the most
common form of HSCR presents along the distal colon, also known as colonic aganglionosis. The
underlying cellular mechanisms that ENPs utilize to migrate into and spatially position along the gut tube,
as well as genetic programs they execute to differentiate into enteric neurons have not been well studied
in vivo, therefore limiting our knowledge of how the ENS manifests. The overall goal is to expand
foundational knowledge of the genes utilized to execute the complex mechanisms necessary for ENS
formation, with an eye for informing downstream translational therapeutic studies. In this proposal, we
utilize zebrafish embryos due to their genetic conservation with humans, the ease of viewing their external
development and for their optical transparency. Building off of single-cell transcriptomic data sets generated
from ENP cells collected during their early neurogenesis along the gut tube, Aim 1 will examine a
hypothesis that the spatial arrangement of newly uncovered ENP transcriptional subpopulations predict
future enteric neuron placement and terminal differentiation along the gut tube. In agreement with and
extending observations in mammalian models, we have recently discovered that Retinoic Acid (RA)
signaling is critical globally during early steps of zebrafish ENS development; however, how RA signaling
autonomously influences ENS ontogenesis in vivo is not well understood in any system to date. Aim 2 will
investigate a hypothesis that the RA pathway autonomously controls ENP differentiation states and
migration patterns along the gut tube using cutting edge single-cell transcriptomics, optogenetics and in
vivo imaging. We will also test a mechanistic model in Aim 2 that candidate transcription factors function
intrinsically downstream of RA in ENPs to govern ENS formation, thereby expanding our understanding of
the ENS gene regulatory network. Aim 3 will use genetic modulation of the cell cycle, quantitative in vivo
imaging and cell tracking test a cellular mechanistic model that ENPs couple proliferation with migration to
dictate proper enteric neuron patterning in the gut downstream of the RA pathway. The results of these
aims will significantly increase our knowledge of the genetic, molecular and cellular underpinnings of ENP
development and early ENS creation and they will provide a new mechanistic framework for studying these
developmentally important cells in vivo."

The long-term objective of this award is to support Dr. Hagar Hallihan, an African American woman, in
advanced training in clinical research and neuroscience and establishing an independent research program.
Her research program focuses on developing clinically relevant and effective integrated behavioral
interventions to improve treatment efficacy and better understand the neuro mechanism of treatment for young
adults with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Her mentorship team is a transdisciplinary group of senior scientists
with research expertise in behavioral clinical trials, behavioral intervention development, AUD in young adults,
neuroimaging data, and quantitative and qualitative research methods. She will continue working with her
current T32 mentor, Dr. Ma, a senior scientist with extensive experience mentoring trainees. This will be
complemented by content and mentoring expertise from Drs. Ajilore, Rospenda, and Wu. Collectively, this
team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow Dr. Hallihan to fill critical gaps in her
knowledge and skill set relating to the study of behavior interventions and neural mechanisms underlying
treatment for young adults with AUD. Her training goals are to develop skills in (1) designing and assessing
effectiveness of mechanistic randomized clinical trials, (2) competency in statistical and fMRI data analyses,
and (3) knowledge and skills in the neurobiology of alcohol addiction. In addition, she will develop professional
skills in scientific leadership and interdisciplinary team science. Achieving these goals will strengthen her
scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful
transition to independence. The proposed research plan builds on Dr. Hallihan’s prior research training in AUD
among young adults. AUD, a chronic disease of impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use, is a costly major
public health problem, most prevalent in young adults (aged18-24 yr). Heavy alcohol consumption impairs
brain structure and function, more severely in young adults than in older adults. However, evidence-based
treatments for AUD in young adults are lacking, and the neural mechanisms following available behavior
treatments are poorly understood. The aims of the K99 phase are (1) to develop an integrated contingency
management (CM) and Problem-Solving Therapy (PST), CM-PST intervention to improve alcohol abstinence
among young adults with AUD, and (2) test feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The aims of the R00
phase are to (1) test the efficacy of CM-PST vs CM alone in a 2-arm pilot RCT, and (2) assess neural
mechanisms associated with CM-PST treatment effects in young adults with AUD. Support from this award will
enable Dr. Hallihan to launch an independent program of research that contributes to the field by 1) developing
and implementing an innovative intervention to improve alcohol abstinence among young adults with AUD, and
2) assess neural mechanisms of successful treatment among young adults with AUD to inform future
intervention and prevention efforts and ultimately reduce the public health burden of AUD."
10813831,"ABSTRACT
 While monoclonal antibodies inhibiting immune checkpoints (ICI) are able to restore anti-tumor immunity
and have dramatically changed the therapeutic options for many cancer patients, up to 60% of patients will
experience immune-related adverse events (irAE) depending on the tumor type and ICI. Thus, the majority of
patients treated with ICI will not see long term benefit and therefore only suffer potential side effects (and possibly
hyper progression), and the importance of predicting and managing ICI-related adverse events has already been
identified as a critical gap in knowledge and clinical practice. Significantly, a common molecular node of
integration between the various inflammatory mechanisms of irAE, particularly in the subacute imaging setting,
focuses on the spurious activation of the innate immune system. In this regard, we recently reported the
discovery and validation of 4-[18F]fluoro-1-naphthol ([18F]4FN), a novel redox-tuned radiopharmaceutical for
selective imaging of highly oxidizing radicals by PET/CT, thus enabling interrogation of activation of key cells
participating in innate immunity. This novel PET radiopharmaceutical may provide a convenient reagent for rapid,
whole-body imaging and quantitative non-invasive surveillance of radical-mediated inflammatory foci generated
by the innate immune system during ICI-mediated irAE. Monitoring irAE by PET imaging is the long-term clinical
imaging goal of this line of investigation. For this R21 proposal, we propose to 1) drive the agent into first-in-
human dosimetry and safety studies in a relevant population of patients at MDACC with irAE, and 2) gain
preliminary signals of efficacy. If successful, this novel agent may increase the clinical utility of PET in precision
medicine."
10799575,"The reversible control of enzyme activity is one of the cornerstone features enabling life. Cycles of protein
phosophorylation and de-phosphorylation have been appreciated for decades to regulate enzymes, and the
pharmacological inhibition of protein kinases and phosphatases has furnished a biotech industry intent on
treating various human diseases for nearly as long. One major drawback to this strategy is that the enzymes that
regulate protein phosphorylation represent perhaps 5 % of the human proteome, such that the vast majority of
aberrant proteins responsible for human disease have remained undruggable. More recently, drugs have been
invented that induce proximity between a disease-causing protein and an enzyme called a ubiquitin ligase that
promotes the destruction of the problematic protein. Indeed, this new drug modality is feeding a billion dollar per
year industry push to employ ubiquitin ligases to treat various human diseases including breast and prostate
cancers as well as multiple myeloma, to name a few. Most of these efforts have been utilizing a family of enzymes
called the Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). With some 200 members in humans, the CRLs collectively control
approximately 20 % of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in cells. As such, an appreciation for how these
enzymes are regulated is of considerable interest to a wide audience from the scientific community. Similar to
the paradigm of protein phosphorylation, the control of CRLs is believed to be determined predominantly through
their reversible modification with a protein called NEDD8. And while human CRLs are known to partner with at
least 7 additional enzymes, which we refer to as ubiquitin-carrying enzymes (UCEs), that help promote CRL-
dependent protein substrate degradation, it also was believed that UCEs act promiscuously towards CRLs which
would preclude CRL regulation at the level of CRL-UCE interaction. However, CRL-UCE specificity is strongly
implied by the recent structure of an active CRL. Preliminary results here indicate that CRL-UCE specificity
endows these pairs with exceptionally rapid rates of ubiquitin transfer and with the capability of producing CRL
substrates modified with unique poly-ubiquitin chain architectures, potentially providing an additional layer of
control of CRL function beyond neddylation. In consideration of these observations, this application seeks to test
the hypothesis that UCEs generally display specificity for CRL-substrate complexes, and that the biological
purpose of these specific CRL-UCE pairs is to both enhance the rates of ubiquitin transfer from UCEs to CRL
substrates as well as to uniquely code the poly-ubiquitin chain to promote outcomes including protein
degradation or localization. The proposed studies will explore an entirely novel area of CRL biology, the
specificity of UCEs for CRLs, utilizing proteomic and cell biological assays to complement a powerful, quantitative
kinetics platform. These studies will illuminate how CRL activities are regulated and support a new drug modality
that harnesses the power of CRLs to degrade disease-causing proteins."
10818588,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in model organisms such as mice and rats have
identified hundreds of genetic loci that are associated with addictive behaviors, but determining the causal
genes remains challenging. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may not adequately tag other classes
of variants such as structural and repetitive variants that have higher mutation rates. Thus, both panels of
inbred strains and outbred populations will fail to identify a subset of loci and causal alleles. We are
proposing to address this serious limitation by using cutting-edge methods to discover and genotype
structural variants (SVs) and tandem repeats (TRs). Because they are technically challenging to analyze,
SVs and TRs have not yet been adequately surveyed in rodents. However, there is already extensive
evidence that SVs and TRs are prevalent in mice and rats, and that they have important functional
consequences. Our proposal brings together complementary expertise in human genetics and bioinformatic
analysis of SVs (Sebat) and repetitive variation (Gymrek) with established leadership in elucidating the
genetic basis of behavioral phenotypes in model organisms (Palmer). This study will generate the first
large-scale resource for analyzing the effects of complex variation on mouse and rat phenotypes. We use
this resource to examine gene expression and behavioral traits in inbred mice (BXD recombinant inbred
strains, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), the Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, the Hybrid Rat
Diversity Panel (HRDP) and the Heterogeneous Stock (HS) outbred rats.
 In Specific Aim 1 we will characterize SVs in inbred and outbred mice and rats by single-molecule
sequencing. In Specific Aim 2 we will genotype TR in inbred and outbred mice and rats. Finally, in
Specific Aim 3 we will perform GWAS using SV and TR for gene expression and behavioral traits. We will
determine the phenotypic consequences of the SV and TR genotypes on gene expression and behavioral
traits. We will impute SVs and TRs into outbred mice and rats and then perform GWAS using the wealth of
preexisting gene expression and behavioral data that are available for the mouse and rat populations
studied in this project. Completion of this project will characterize the SV and TR landscape in mice and
rats, elucidate their role in gene expression and complex behavioral traits relevant to addiction, and create
a community resource that will enhance numerous ongoing mouse and rat genetic studies."
10816442,"SUMMARY
The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic HIV infection promotes telomere
attrition and T cell aging, leading to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine hypo-responsiveness. To this end, we will use a
model that emulates HBV vaccine response in the setting of HIV infection. Since co-infection of HBV with HIV is
common and associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, HBV vaccine is required to prevent HBV co-
infection in HIV patients. However, HBV vaccine response in HIV-infected patients is often blunted with only 30-60%
seroconversion (HBsAb > 10 IU/ml) compared to 90-95% success rate in age-matched healthy subjects (HS). This
poor vaccine response is also observed with influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in HIV patients and other
immunocompromised hosts, including the elderly. Recently, we have found that chronic HIV or HCV infection can
cause premature T cell aging, as evidenced by overexpression of the aging markers KLRG1, DUSP6, CD57, and
p16ink4a, dysregulation of age-associated noncoding RNAs GAS5/miR21 and, in particular, accelerated telomere
attrition - suggesting excessive proliferative turnover or inadequate telomere maintenance. Telomere integrity is a
key feature of linear chromosomes that preserves genomic stability and function, whereas telomere attrition is a
hallmark of cell aging or senescence that drives cell dysfunctions and apoptosis. While telomere length is maintained
in most cases by a telomerase that prolongs telomeric DNA, telomere-associated proteins (shelterins) protect
telomeres from unwanted DNA damage response (DDR). We investigated the mechanisms of telomere attrition in
the setting of HCV and HIV infections and discovered that the cellular expression and activity of telomerase are
intact, whereas the telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) is significantly inhibited in CD4 T cells derived from
HCV- or HIV-infected patients. Since the role of TRF2 is to protect telomeres from unwanted DNA damage and
recruit DNA repair enzymes (e.g., telomerase) access/function at telomeres, we hypothesize that: i) the mechanisms
involved in TRF2 inhibition may accelerate telomere attrition and CD4 T cell aging during HIV infection; ii) TRF2
inhibition may result in poor access/function of telomerase at telomeres during HIV infection; and iii) TRF2-mediated
telomere attrition and CD4 T cell aging may play a pivotal role in the failure of HBV vaccine in HIV-infected patients.
To test this hypothesis, we will 1) define the mechanisms involved in TRF2 inhibition and telomere attrition in T cell
aging during HIV infection; 2) determine how TRF2-mediated telomerase transport to telomeres affects T cell aging
during HIV infection; and 3) determine the impact of telomere attrition and T cell aging on HBV vaccine failure during
HIV infection and whether restoring TRF2-mediated telomere sheltering and telomerase homing machinery can
rescue CD4 T cells from telomere attrition and restore cell functions. This translational study is significant in that it
will provide a working model to explore mechanisms underlying the diminished vaccine (immune) responses in many
chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases, including but not limited to HIV. Understanding these mechanisms
may uncover novel treatment targets to improve vaccine efficacy and/or immune responses in immunocompromised
hosts. It is thus clinically significant, timely, and relevant to the Veterans as well as public health."
10808147,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
NIAAA identifies underage drinking as a public health issue with serious consequences. Sexual minority youth
(SMY) who use alcohol have even worse consequences, such as increased risk of cancer, risky sexual
behavior, and suicidal attempts, due to their stigmatized identity. Hispanic SMY may be at even greater risk of
developing alcohol use problems because of the additive status-based discrimination that may arise from being
a sexual and ethnoracial minority. Minority stress theory posits that youth who experience discriminatory
events cope with psychological distress by using alcohol. To date, little is known about how Hispanic SMY
respond to social stressors or how socio-cultural protective factors (i.e., coping strategies, social support) and
negative and positive affect may mediate these stressors’ effects on Hispanic SMY’s use of alcohol. EMA is a
unique method that can assess minority stress theory, psychological distress, and alcohol use in real-time,
however it has not been used to assess this relationship with Hispanic SMY. In line with NIH’s recent call for
increased research on sexual minority health, the research aims of this Career Development Award (K08) are
to: 1) Assess the acceptability and feasibility of the minority stress, alcohol, and protective factor measures in
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) between Hispanic and white SMY; 2) Examine the effects of minority
stress on SMY’s alcohol use and the mediating effects of affect; and 3) Examine the sociocultural risk and
protective factors of alcohol use. This study will be conducted in 3 phases. In Phase 1, the measures will be
developed using cognitive interviews with Hispanic and white SMY (N=20 or until saturation is reached). Phase
2 will consist of a pilot-EMA testing of the EMA with Hispanic and white SMY (N=20) over two-weeks and post-
EMA cognitive interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the EMA. In phase 3, the finalized EMA
will be conducted over a 30-day period to assess minority stress, affect, and sociocultural protective factors of
alcohol use among 50 Hispanic and 50 white SMY. This K08 proposed study and mentor plan will help the
candidate develop expertise in 1) The development and progression of alcohol use in youth; 2) Risk and
protective factors of alcohol use in SMY; 3) Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methodologies; 4)
Intensive longitudinal data analysis for analyzing EMA; and 5) cultural adaptation of measures and
interventions for SMY of color. The training goals will build off of the candidate’s prior training in 1) Positive
youth development among youth of color; 2) The effects of discrimination on substance use; 3) qualitative
analysis, and 4) advanced statistical analysis."
10816508,"Summary:
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the US. The current gold
standard for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury in the setting of focal brain ischemia is
restoration of blood flow with recanalization. However, a substantial portion of the damage
caused by ischemia/reperfusion occurs during the reperfusion phase: as ischemic tissue is
reoxygenated, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are quickly generated, starting early during reflow.
Reperfusion injury has proved difficult to treat pharmacologically, likely because effective drug
concentrations have not built up sufficiently during the early phase of reperfusion.
The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is a major site of ROS production during cellular
stress due to ETC hyper-activation, which causes high mitochondrial membrane potentials (∆Ψm),
which in turn trigger excessive ROS production. We propose that the ideal therapy should target
the ETC non-invasively to prevent the generation of ROS from the onset of reflow. Accordingly,
our overall goal in this application is to develop a new, non-invasive therapy to normalize
mitochondrial hyperactivity during reflow. We will capitalize on the photoreceptive
properties of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) for near infrared light (NIR) to modulate
mitochondrial activity, thereby attenuating the production of ROS and, as a result, limit
ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. Cytochrome c oxidase is the primary cellular photo-
acceptor of NIR and the terminal enzyme of the ETC. We have discovered specific NIR
wavelengths that partially inhibit COX (instead of activating COX, i.e., the current paradigm).
We show that inhibitory NIR, applied at the time of reperfusion, provides profound
neuroprotection. In this proposal, we will build on these compelling preliminary data and
capitalize on the unique, multi-disciplinary expertise of our research team to:
 • Interrogate the molecular underpinnings of ischemia/reperfusion injury and of NIR therapy
 (Aim 1).
 • Uncover the mechanisms of NIR therapy following stroke (Aim 2)
 • Develop the optimal use of NIR therapy as a treatment for ischemic stroke (Aim 3)."
10889027,"PROJECT SUMMARY (from parent application)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major health problem, causing more than 700,000 deaths
annually worldwide. Although HCC treatment has greatly improved over the last decades, most HCC patients
diagnosed at advanced stages are ineligible for curative ablative therapies such as liver resection or
transplantation. Until recently, the only FDA-approved therapies for such patients were sorafenib and
regorafenib, used as first-line and second-line therapy, respectively. Unfortunately, these two closely related
multikinase inhibitors provide limited survival benefits. In September 2017, nivolumab, a PD-1 (programmed
cell death 1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for HCC treatment in
second line, after the promising results obtained in a phase II clinical trial (NCT01658878). Despite some HCC
patients show unprecedented responses with nivolumab, not all patients respond, indicating the existence of
mechanisms that drive resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy and highlighting the urgent need to identify biomarkers
for optimal patient selection and strategies to overcome resistance. Studies in other tumor types demonstrate
that different tumor-intrinsic oncogenic pathways, such as PI3K or WNT/β-catenin, promote immune escape
and confer resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy but also inform patient stratification and strategies to overcome
resistance. Our central hypothesis is that specific oncogenic signaling pathways activated in HCC amplify the
mechanisms of immune evasion and thereby impair the response to anti-PD-1 therapy. By using a novel
mouse model of HCC immune surveillance that we have recently created, we have recently demonstrated that
CTNNB1 (β-catenin), PTEN, and KMT2C (MLL3), three genes frequently altered in human HCC, are involved
in immune escape, demonstrating the feasibility of the project. Moreover, CTNNB1 activation confers
resistance to anti-PD-1 blockade and could potentially serve as a biomarker for patient exclusion. Here, by
combining this novel mouse model, human HCC samples, and transcriptional and immune profilings, we will
establish the signaling pathways that promote immune escape in HCC, the underlying mechanisms of immune
escape, and their effects on response to anti-PD-1 therapy."

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is routinely used among patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer
(DTC), with approximately 76% of patients receiving RAI. Patients with DTC post RAI treatment report
extensive short-term and late effects of treatment, symptom burden, and unmet informational needs about
treatment related side effects. However, thyroid cancer is frequently referred to as the “good cancer” and is an
understudied cancer population for survivorship research and web-based interventions. One way to address
these gaps is through digital technologies such as a web-based intervention, which can empower patients with
direct access to educational and support tools to reduce symptom burden. I propose to develop and evaluate a
web-based intervention, called iSupport (informational support among patients post RAI treatment), to reduce
symptom burden among patients diagnosed with DTC post RAI. I propose the following aims: Aim 1 (K99).
Develop iSupport, a web-based intervention, for patients with DTC post RAI therapy. Aim 2 (K99). Test the
usability of the newly developed iSupport intervention among patients with DTC post RAI. Aim 3 (R00).
Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the iSupport intervention. Aim 4 (R00). Test the preliminary efficacy
of the iSupport intervention vs. treatment as usual (TAU) among patients with DTC on symptom burden. The
K99 phase will involve: 1) conducting patient focus groups (N=32) and individual stakeholder interviews (N=12)
to develop iSupport and 2) testing the usability of the iSupport intervention among patients with DTC post RAI
therapy (N=8). The R00 phase will involve conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=72) to: 1)
assess the feasibility and acceptability of iSupport and 2) test the preliminary efficacy of iSupport compared to
a (TAU) control group with DTC patients on RAI-related symptom burden, patient bioheath indicators (oral
mucositis; oral health problems), knowledge of DTC and RAI, self-efficacy for coping with side effects, cancer-
related distress, and health-related quality of life. The overall objective of the K99/R00 is to provide Dr. Carr
with training and mentorship to become an independent cancer control investigator with expertise in digital
technology evidenced-based interventions among cancer patients. The K99 training goals include: 1) increase
knowledge of clinical concerns and symptoms among patients with DTC post RAI, 2) obtain advanced training
in technology-based intervention design and development, 3) develop expertise in behavioral intervention
clinical trials design and testing, and 4) refine grant writing and leadership skills for future independence. Dr.
Carr’s mentorship team includes Drs. Kristi Graves (primary), Jacqueline Jonklaas (co-mentor), and Kristen
Miller (co-mentor) who are committed to her career development. The proposed training plan will facilitate Dr.
Carr’s transition to independence as a cancer control researcher with expertise in digital health interventions to
reduce symptom burden and improve health-related quality of life in cancer patient outcomes after treatment."
10775799,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Chronic
intestinal inflammation is a major risk factor for the development and progression of sporadic and colitis-
associated colorectal cancer (CAC). While the pathogenic effects of tumor-promoting inflammation are widely
recognized, the mechanisms driving this process, including the cellular and molecular mediators are poorly
understood. This has therapeutic implications especially in CRC where the currently available T-cell checkpoint
inhibitors have a limited benefit. In preliminary studies, we used the azoxymethane/ dextran sulfate sodium model
of inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis that allows interrogation of the initiation-promotion events
underpinning the development of CAC. We observed that compared to the surrounding non-tumor-bearing colon,
the tumor microenvironment is enriched with tumor-infiltrating myeloid (TIM) cells, including neutrophils (PMNs),
monocytes, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). PMNs are the predominant population and are
recruited through the Cxc-Cxcr2 axis while the monocytes/TAMs (M) appear to rely on the Cc-Ccr2 pathway.
Both subsets express pro-inflammatory and immune-suppressive genes thereby suggesting their pro-
tumorigenic role. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment has an increased abundance of interleukin (IL)-17
producing CD4+ T (Th17) and gamma-delta T cells. IL-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes CRC
growth and increased expression is associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies indicate that TIMs promote
Th17 development through the production of IL-23 (IL-23A/IL-12B heterodimer). However, our single-cell RNA
sequencing studies revealed that while the PMNs expressed Il23a, they did not express Il12b thereby suggesting
an inability to produce functional IL-23. Instead, the PMNs expressed Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (Ebi3)
which has recently been shown to dimerize with IL-23A to form IL-39, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We
hypothesize that the myeloid-Th17 axis is critical for the maintenance of an inflammatory microenvironment that
helps sustain CAC progression. We propose the existence of a feed-forward loop in the tumor microenvironment
whereby the PMNs and M work synergistically to promote Th17 development, and the resulting IL-17, in turn,
recruits and maintains more PMNs and M in the tumor thereby reinforcing an inflammatory microenvironment
which fuels CAC progression. Mechanisms to disrupt this loop will be the focus of our proposal. Our first aim will
attempt to define the role of TIMs in the pathogenesis of CAC by exploring the effects of blocking colonic
recruitment of PMNs and M on tumor development (Aim IA) or their deletion in established tumors (Aim IB). In
our second aim, we will explore the role of IL-39 as an alternative mechanism of Th17 development (Aim IIA)
and assess its role in tumor development (Aim IIB), including the effects of cell-specific deletion of the Ebi3 in
PMNs and CD4+T cells (Aim IIC). These studies will have implications in treatment strategies for patients with
CAC and other immune-mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease."
10795938,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Activating KRAS mutations, altered metabolism, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are all
hallmarks of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The recent groundbreaking discovery of KRASG12C
specific inhibitors has reinvigorated hope for direct targeting of this dominant driver oncogene formerly deemed
“undruggable”. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the therapeutic potential of mutant KRAS
inhibitors in PDAC and other malignancies will only be realized if they are administered as components of
rationally designed combination therapies. To identify actionable immunomodulatory and metabolic events
triggered by KRASG12C inhibition in PDAC, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were
performed in human and murine models. KRASG12C inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells limited the expression
of immunosuppressive chemokines, increased antigen presentation pathways, reduced nutrient (glucose and
glutamine) consumption, and the production of immunosuppressive metabolites (lactate). These studies
indicate that KRASG12C inhibitors exert immune-priming effects in PDAC and support combinations with
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agents. However, these immune-priming effects were accompanied by
alterations in nucleotide metabolism and by elevated extracellular adenosine levels. This finding has great
potential significance since adenosine is known to curtail anti-tumor immunity by engaging adenosine A2a/A2b
receptors (A2aR/A2bR) on a broad array of immune cell types. Remaining to be determined, if these
observations are to be exploited for therapeutic purposes in KRASG12C PDAC, are (i) the mechanisms by which
KRASG12C inhibition modulates nucleotide metabolism and adenosine levels in PDAC cells, (ii) the requisite
components of ICB (anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4) when co-targeting KRASG12C and A2aR/A2bR in animal
models, and (iii) whether targeting adenosine signaling promotes synergy between KRASG12C inhibition and
ICB in patients with KRASG12C PDAC. Studies proposed in Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that elevations in
adenosine levels induced by KRASG12C inhibition reflect alterations in nucleotide metabolism, leading both to
increased pancreatic tumor cell adenosine efflux and to decreased adenosine uptake. Aim 2 entails
mechanistically-based testing of combinations co-targeting KRASG12C, A2aR/A2bR and conventional immune
checkpoints in new orthotopic, metastatic and genetic murine models of KRASG12C pancreatic cancer. Aim 3
consists of a first-in-human investigator-initiated phase IA/IB clinical trial to test the tolerability and efficacy of
our combinations as second-line therapies in patients with pancreatic cancer. Proposed studies will establish a
new mechanistic framework of interrelationships between KRASG12C inhibition, nucleotide metabolism,
adenosine signaling, and immunosuppression both in mouse models of PDAC and in patients. They will also
provide the foundation for forward and reverse translation studies to improve immunotherapy responses in
patients with KRASG12C PDAC and, potentially, in other KRASG12C malignancies."

This new T32 application proposes a research training program for under-represented physician scientists in the
areas of pulmonary and sleep disorders medicine at the University of Miami (UM), Miller School of Medicine.
The PURPoSe (Promoting Under-Represented Minorities in Pulmonary and Sleep Research) training program
will be based in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at UM and will leverage the faculty
from various departments across the institution. The primary goal is to provide a rigorous and fertile environment
of training for underrepresented post-doctoral fellows and foster their development into academic physician-
scientists. The T32 program will offer an exceptional training platform in basic, translational, and health services
research to develop independent, successful, high-impact physician researchers in Pulmonary and Sleep
Medicine. Three areas of scientific focus will be available to the trainees: Track A will focus on the etiology, risk,
and outcomes related to obstructive airways disease (i.e., asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
Track B will offer training in the biology, impact, and health-care disparities in lung cancer/smoking cessation;
and Track C will focus on improving outcomes related to obstructive sleep apnea/sleep disorders in the
underserved. Trainees will select a primary track of emphasis. The goals of this T32 grant will be achieved via
mentored, didactic, and experiential exposures leveraging all UM affiliates including the UM-Health System, the
Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Jackson Health System, and the Bruce W. Carter Department of
Veterans Affairs Medical Center to provide an unparalleled opportunity to address key priorities in Pulmonary
and Sleep Medicine. The program will be supported by 21 mentors who have grants totaling $11.7 in annual
funding. Mentors include 10 MDs, 9 PhDs and 2 MD/PhDs across several departments. Collectively, mentors
have outstanding expertise in obstructive lung disease epidemiology and outcomes, airway biology, programs
for early screening and basic mechanisms of lung cancer, and sleep disorders medicine. Training (e.g., didactics,
seminars, online modules) has been aligned with the competencies to be gained (e.g., epidemiology, clinical
research methods, biostatistics, ethical conduct of research, and grant writing) and will capitalizes on the
institutional access to specific subgroups (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual/gender identity) and expertise in applied
methods (e.g., basic science, clinical/translational research, dissemination/implementation science, health and
disparities research). This T32 training program will support two postdoctoral fellows per year. Applicants will be
expected to have a MDs who are concurrently enrolled in the Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine post-
doctoral fellowship. Individual development plans (IDPs) will be created for trainees to facilitate oversight by
mentors. Internal and External Advisory Boards, and Diversity and Inclusion, and Arbitration committees will
provide ongoing evaluation and feedback to ensure that the goals of T32 program are effectivelymet."
10889002,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States (U.S.). HPV infection is
linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx, thus representing a significant public health
concern. The HPV vaccine is the most efficient and cost-effective mechanism for combating HPV infection and its cancer-
related consequences. Nonetheless, HPV vaccination rates for age-eligible adolescents remain suboptimal in the U.S.
Scientific evidence underscores the critical influence of sociocultural and contextual factors on parents’ acceptability and
uptake of the HPV vaccination. Sociocultural values, family expectations, health literacy, beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge
influence parents’ behaviors and decisions, healthcare-seeking and utilization, and health outcomes. Black women are
disproportionally affected by HPV-associated morbidity and mortality, with the second-highest cervical cancer incidence
rate, the second highest after non-Hispanic Whites and the highest cancer mortality rate. However, there is a lack of data
for African ethnic minority subgroups such as Cape Verdeans (CV) in the U.S, an ethnic minority group of mixed West
African and Portuguese roots. The U.S. is home to the largest CV population outside the country of Cape Verde, with an
estimated 265,000 CV immigrants and their descendants living in the U.S. CVs primarily reside (~90%) in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island. Understanding HPV and HPV vaccination knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) of specific ethnic
minoritized and immigrant subgroups, such as CV, will make it possible to meet particular subgroup needs and improve
knowledge and practices, thereby improving health status and outcomes by decreasing cancer risk. Though recent research
has shown an increase in HPV uptake, but not necessarily HPV vaccine completion, among minority populations including
African Americans and Blacks, no data exist to show that this is the case for CV adolescents living in the U.S. Also, there
remains a paucity of data regarding HPV knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of CV parents living in the U.S. Therefore,
the proposed study will focus on Cape Verdeans, a population group currently underrepresented in cancer health disparity
research, and seeks to: 1) explore the KAB regarding HPV and HPV vaccination (intention, hesitancy, barriers, initiation,
and completion) among CV mothers and fathers (Phase 1: Focus Groups); and 2) explore CV parents’ HPV KAB, health
communication, sociocultural factors, their intention to have their sons and daughters undergo HPV vaccination, HPV
vaccine hesitancy, barriers to HPV vaccination, and parent-reported receipt of HPV vaccine or refusal of the vaccine (Phase
2: Survey Administration). The proposed community-engaged research is innovative in that it will: 1) engage CVs, an
understudied ethnic minority and immigrant subpopulation currently underrepresented in HPV research, 2) include fathers
who are under-represented in HPV research, and 3) establish a partnership with Catholic and Protestant churches to further
assist with the important goal of addressing HPV vaccine myths and disseminating accurate HPV vaccine information to
CV communities. Moreover, it will provide a solid basis for the design of future linguistically and culturally tailored
education interventions to promote the HPV vaccine among CVs in the U.S. Moreover, this research will build further
research capacity to engage underserved, minority CV parents in future HPV and cancer prevention interventions."

CEC serves as a national leader in and model for engagement with communities—especially those which consist
primarily of Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander and African-Americans living under economic hardship and facing
disproportionate adverse health outcomes from social and environmental disparities. The CEC primary target
audiences include communities, primarily reached through community-based organizations, together with
policymakers and health professionals to address: (a) transportation-related air pollution and impacts on health,
which has evolved directly from key SCEHSC research findings showing air pollution to be one of Southern CA’s
leading environmental health issues; (b) concerns about health impacts from goods movement facilities,
including marine ports, railyards and inland warehouses; and (c) broader health and emerging air quality
concerns arising from land-use decisions such as locating industries adjacent to homes and schools across the
multiethnic landscape. Over the past 24 years, the CEC has developed a successful model to listen to the
community and engage community-based organizations and decision-makers in addressing environmental
health disparities related to traffic and goods movement in Southern CA. During the current cycle, we built on
this approach to integrate novel methods to train residents and health professionals in participatory air
monitoring, to collaborate with multiple stakeholders to assess and reduce toxic air emissions at a neighborhood
scale, and to expand our engagement program to address growing concerns around industrial facilities across
the region. We leverage traditional and nontraditional communications techniques such as digital StoryMaps,
social media, and infographics to update stakeholders on current science and engage the power of communities
to reduce EH burdens. In this next cycle we aim to: 1) Facilitate a multidirectional communication structure that
fosters interaction, share SCEHSC research findings and engagement models with local/regional/national

10805386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current treatments for depression and anxiety are often limited by partial efficacy and significant side effects.
These disorders constitute serious public health challenges due to significant burden of illness, and the lack of
more effective treatments contributes to substantial suicide risks. To address these unmet needs, non-invasive
brain stimulation is a circuit-based treatment with minimal side effects; it is clinically available for major
depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, with evidence for efficacy in anxiety and posttraumatic stress
disorder. One of the core brain regions involved in these disorders, among others, is the amygdala, with its
critical role in salience detection and emotion processing. This region demonstrates pathological activation in
nearly all depressive and anxiety disorders, and pathological activity changes with successful treatment. Yet,
because the amygdala is distal to the cortical surface it is not directly accessible with current technologies. Our
challenge is to find a way to focally and non-invasively modulate the amygdala, with the broader hypothesis
that direct engagement will yield treatments with superior clinical outcomes.
 Low intensity pulsed focused ultrasound (LIFU) applies non-invasive acoustic energy to safely
modulate neural activity in translational models and non-human primates. Unlike transcranial magnetic or
electrical stimulation and related technologies, LIFU is able to directly and focally modulate activity within deep
brain structures. LIFU can safely modulate human somatosensory and motor cortex and safely suppress
thalamic activity; recent data indicates it can suppress amygdala activity. Furthermore, an MRI-compatible
LIFU system is now available (Brainsonix, Inc. LA, USA), thus permitting simultaneous fMRI-LIFU experiments.
These factors create a compelling argument to develop LIFU as a treatment for depression and anxiety by
testing whether it can safely modulate the amygdala.
 To set the stage for future clinical trials, we must first test how LIFU engages the amygdala in patients
with depression and anxiety. In accordance with the U01 RFA, we propose several pilot experiments. We will
systematically assess safety (Aim 1) as we evaluate spatial specificity of target engagement, using online and
offline approaches (Aims 2-3) using a randomized, anatomically controlled, experimental design, and explore
the impact of LIFU on clinical symptoms. We obtained an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA
for this proposal as it is written.
 If successful, this first-in-human proposal will provide the necessary data to support a broad and
programmatic research focus on clinically applied LIFU for depression and anxiety. Resulting data will inform
future studies, including improvement of individual-level modeling for LIFU, informing optimal targets to
engage, refinement of LIFU shams, and evaluating effects of varied LIFU parameters or multiple sessions."

Gliomas are rarely curable tumors with a low survival rate of 36% at five-years that is well below the average
survival rate of 67.2% across all cancers, according to SEER and CBTRUS. Malignant brain tumors cause an
average of 20 years of potential life lost (YPLL) for individuals diagnosed as adults, which exceeds most
common cancers. Survival and YPLL have not improved for gliomas similarly to other cancers and progress is
desperately needed. The lack of improvement in patient outcomes is not due to lack of new discoveries, but
due to limited success in translating this knowledge into clinical benefit. Important discoveries have been made
over the last decade regarding key molecular mechanisms involved in glioma initiation and growth, which have
been incorporated in the latest WHO classification. IDH mutation is the primary event in glioma initiation and
has become a paradigm shift in the treatment of glioma. Neuro-oncology experts (SNO, EANO) agree that
brain imaging can accelerate clinical trials of targeted therapies and mandated the development of molecular
imaging for highly specific and sensitive glioma imaging. The long-term goal of our research is the
development of non-invasive molecular imaging methods that can be used clinically in cancer patients. IDH
mutations are frequent in glioma and produce high levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that
can be imaged as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, guidance of surgery and radiation,
response to chemotherapy and targeted treatments. The objective of this application is to develop fast high
resolution whole brain quantitative 2HG and metabolic imaging for diagnosis, treatment guidance and
monitoring of mutant IDH and wildtype glioma. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that advancing next
generation 2HG and metabolic imaging will enable precision oncology and accelerate clinical translation of
novel targeted therapies to improve outcomes in mutant IDH and wildtype glioma patients. Three specific aims
will be performed for this: 1) develop fast high-resolution whole-brain clinically robust 2HG and metabolic
imaging, 2) improve sensitivity, precision, accuracy and workflow of 2HG and metabolic imaging, and 3) clinical
translation of next generation 2HG and metabolic imaging in glioma patients. There are strong rationales for
the proposed research: 1) there is no alternative in vivo imaging method specific for IDH mutations, 2) 2HG
imaging is completely non-invasive, can be repeated safe without any radiation, can provide results fast and
cost effective, 3) provides comprehensive evaluation of the entire tumor and healthy brain without the sampling
bias of biopsies, 4) it can be performed pre-surgically and in tumors that cannot be operated. The approach is
innovative because it employs the first available whole brain 2HG imaging method, which will be accelerated
by compressed sensing, novel shim hardware to improve data quality, and transformed in a high throughput
automated tool by deep learning. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will
provide clinicians with a user-friendly and precise tool for diagnostic, guiding and monitoring of glioma patients."
10764901,"Project/Summary Abstract
African Americans are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) as Whites, but few studies have
focused on these cognitive disparities and related mechanisms. Perceived stress in minority groups such as
African Americans, directly affects cognition and also plays a role in worsening of CVD risk factors and
unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, improper diet, and physical inactivity. Further understanding the role of
modifiable risk factors such as perceived stress in cognitive decline could have an important role in developing
effective preventive strategies and addressing health disparities in aging populations. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to examine the association of stress and cognition, role of CVD risk factors, and related
health disparities. The research proposed in this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award includes data analyses involving two cohort studies and determining the feasibility of a pilot clinical trial.
The plan describes three separate but interrelated projects designed to examine the association of perceived
stress and cognition.
Specific Aim-1: The study will prospectively examine the relationship between perceived stress and incident
cognitive impairment among African Americans and Whites in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Cohort (n=30,239) and explore if CVD risk factors mediate this relationship.
Specific Aim-2: The study will assess the relationship of perceived stress with specific cognitive domains
among African Americans and Whites with Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Vascular Contributors to
Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (VASCULAR) cohort study (n=341) at Emory.
Specific Aim-3: The study will determine the feasibility of a novel web-based multidisciplinary stress reduction
program and assess the program's effects on perceived stress, related biomarkers, and cognition among
African Americans and Whites with Mild Cognitive Impairment (n=30).
Candidate: The candidate (Dr. Kulshreshtha) is a board certified Family Physician in the Department of Family
and Preventive Medicine at Emory University. His long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician
researcher investigating the mechanisms of behavioral and lifestyle interventions to improve cognitive health
and reduce health disparities. The integrated research and training program described in this proposal will
build on the candidate's prior experience in cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities, and primary care
clinical work. It will incorporate new training in cognitive and stress measurements, and clinical trials, to
develop expertise in the area of stress and cognition research for AD prevention. Overall this research will form
the basis for larger studies investigating potential mechanisms and interventions for AD prevention and
establish Dr. Kulshreshtha as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research."
10769733,"Abstract
Despite the risks of adolescent initiation of drug use for lifelong addiction and its tremendous health and
societal costs, the neurobiological factors leading to increased vulnerability to substance use disorders (SUDs),
including cocaine (COC) use disorder (CUD), are poorly understood. Early life stress (ELS), including adverse
experiences such as childhood maltreatment (MALT), is a major risk factor for psychopathologies like SUDs,
anxiety and depression, which are often comorbid. Indeed, individuals with histories of childhood MALT are
more vulnerable to COC addiction, and deficits in emotional regulation predisposes them to stress-induced
relapse, contributing to spiraling of drug taking. Despite these risks, how ELS and COC abuse during
adolescence interact to alter brain development, increasing vulnerability to CUD later in life, has not been
elucidated. There are also strong sex differences in progression from initiation of drug use during adolescence
(experimentation) to the onset of drug dependence, with women showing increased vulnerability, although the
underlying neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. The goal of this proposal is to examine long-term ELS-
related impact and neurobiological mechanisms of increased risk to CUD during adulthood. To accomplish this,
we are using a unique and highly translational nonhuman primate (NHP) model of infant MALT with
adolescence COC self-administration (SA) and addressing sex differences. The studies proposed here with a
cohort of adult macaques that experienced infant MALT followed by COC SA during adolescence, and
characterized longitudinally since birth, are unparalleled. They will provide information of critical relevance for
the human HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
(ABCD) NIH studies by examining early risk factors and neurobiological mechanisms for SUDs.
The studies leverage this unique cohort of animals during adulthood to examine the long-term impact of ELS
and adolescence COC SA on neurobiology of reward and stress/emotion regulatory circuits following a year of
COC abstinence (Aim 1), neurobiological changes in dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) receptors and
functional connectivity (FC) of prefrontal cortex (PFC) with ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and
amygdala following re-exposure to COC SA (Aim 2), and the rate of recovery of DA and 5-HT receptors and
FC during abstinence from long-term COC, to investigate whether it predicts COC-induced relapse and
responses to pharmacological interventions targeting DA and 5-HT receptors; PET data will inform
personalized medicine approaches (Aim 3). We hypothesize differential effectiveness of DA and 5-HT receptor
compounds (alone vs. mixtures) in MALT than Control animals, and in females versus males. We propose that
ELS, in addition to adolescence COC exposure, leads to the dysregulation of reward and stress/emotional
systems typically reported in human psychiatric conditions, resulting in increased risk to CUD in adulthood, in
comparison to animals with COC adolescence exposure but no ELS history."

Abstract
 Countless environmental exposures throughout the human life course and influence human development
and susceptibility to disease. Assessing how multiple exposures synergize or antagonize each other to affect
human health is a powerful approach to understanding the all-around impact of environmental exposures.
Such approach will be needed in the new paradigm of exposome research, which encompass all non-genetic
causes for diseases, from external natural to social environments and from internal macro- to
microenvironments. However, many environmental investigations are challenged by the special data structure
and characteristics of time-dependent exposures. In particular, multiple environmental exposures: 1) are inter-
correlated; 2) are time-dependent; 3) exhibit time-varying effects; 4) have heterogeneous effects; and 5)
demonstrate complex and nonlinear exposure-response relationships. The limiting availability of statistical
models and analytical tools to handle these challenges hinder our ability to make inference or draw
conclusions about the effects of multiple exposures on human health. Building upon our experience developing
statistical methodologies and motivated by the challenges encountered in many of our collaborations in
environmental research, we propose to develop and implement novel statistical methods to address important
scientific questions in environmental health research, specifically through the following aims: 1) evaluate the
effects of time-dependent environmental exposures on time-invariant health outcomes and identify critical
windows of vulnerability; 2) characterize the effects of time-dependent environmental exposures on time-to-
event and longitudinal outcomes; 3) investigate the heterogeneous impacts by environmental exposures on
subpopulations; and 4) develop, distribute, and support open-source software packages for the proposed
methods. All proposed models, estimation, and testing procedures will be investigated through analytical
approaches, theoretical inference, numerical simulations, and applications to multiple datasets from approved
human-subject studies. Upon its completion, the proposed project will provide new statistical methods that both
support ongoing collaborations to address critical scientific questions and enable the environmental health
research community to better assess the impact of time-dependent exposures."
10738301,"Abstract
B lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract are constantly stimulated by microbial antigens. In order to prevent
commensal outgrowth and maintain intestinal homeostasis, B cells need to mount a rapid antibody response
against bacterial antigens. To achieve this task, the humoral immune system relies on a complex multistep
process of B cell proliferation and selection in the germinal center, which eventually gives rise to either
antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells.
Intestinal B cells are mainly expressing immunoglobulin A (IgA), but how this specific antigen receptor isotype
shapes B cell fate and antibody response in the gut is poorly understood. Moreover, dysregulation of IgA
response is associated with increased infection susceptibility and autoinflammation at the mucosal interfaces.
Therefore, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that intrinsically regulate the fate and function of
individual B cell clones in the gut remains a central question in immunology with clear translational
implications.
Several lines of evidence indicate that distinct B cell receptor isotypes act as intrinsic regulators of germinal
center B cell response. However, how B cells integrate IgA antigen receptor signaling with germinal center
dynamics and antibody response remains undefined to date.
In this application we test the hypothesis that surface IgA directly controls germinal center B cell response
through its enhanced intracellular signaling and Ca2+ release. This leads to the generation of a lower
threshold of B cell activation, therefore allowing B cell specific for poorly immunogenic commensal species to
be recruited into the germinal center and to participate to the humoral response. We also hypothesize that
IgA signaling prevents counterselection mediated by FAS, allowing survival of low affinity B cells.
Accumulating evidence indicates IgA coating of commensals is less dependent on antigen affinity, but the
mechanisms underpinning this phenotype have not been investigated so far.
Our aims are: 1) to dissect the role of IgA-dependent BCR signaling on cell migration into the intestinal
tissue and on the quality of the antibody response; and 2) to define the role of Fas-FasL axis in counter-
selecting mucosal IgA+ germinal center B cells for efficient intestinal response.
The proposed studies examine a very poorly understood crosstalk between IgA signaling and adaptive
immune system activation in the gut. It is our expectation that these studies will increase our understanding
of how intestinal antigen recognition shapes B cell responses and adaptive immunity both at steady state and
during enteric infections. Furthermore, our studies will provide a foundation for better understanding of the
relationship between BCR-intracellular signaling and differentiation of gut-homing B lymphocytes that assure
mucosal humoral immunity."

INVESTIGATORS: Rhima Coleman, PhD (PI) is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering focused on
genetic engineering of stem cells for the treatment of joint pathology. Tristan Maerz, PhD (Co-PI) is an Assistant
Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery with expertise in PTOA pathophysiology and synovial inflammation.
RESEARCH CONTEXT: Persistent intra-articular inflammation is a recognized driver of joint pathology during
post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) progression. Mesenchymal stem/multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) possess
potent anti-inflammatory properties, and MSC-derived chondrocytes (MdChs) have shown promise as a
regenerative intra-articular treatment. Successful implementation of MdChs as a cellular therapy is currently
hindered by rapid hypertrophic maturation of MdChs driven by the transcription factor RUNX2, which is
exacerbated by cytokines known to be enriched in the PTOA joint. We have genetically engineered MdChs to
autonomously suppress RUNX2 (sRX2-MdChs), and, therefore, chondrocyte hypertrophy, which supports
cartilage formation, even under inflammation. Critically, our preliminary data also indicate that the secretome of
these genetically modified cells markedly reduce the local pro-inflammatory environment by inducing
repolarization of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) into the anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype.
OBJECTIVE: To test the disease-modifying and anti-inflammatory efficacy of genetically engineered RUNX2-
suppressing MdChs as a cellular treatment in a murine model of PTOA.
SPECIFIC AIMS: 1). Demonstrate that a single sRX2-MdCh injection blocks pathological inflammation and
PTOA progression following joint injury. 2). Characterize the mechanisms that mediate the autocrine and
paracrine effects of the sRX2-MdChs secretome on cartilage formation and the anti-inflammatory cellular
crosstalk between sRX2-MdChs and macrophages in vitro.
RESEARCH PLAN: In Aim 1, we will employ a noninvasive murine joint injury model of PTOA to test the anti-
inflammatory and PTOA-mitigating effects of a single sRX2-MdCh injection following injury. Male and female
mice will be randomized to 1) sRX2-MdChs; 2) Scramble-MdChs; 3) Unmodified/WT MSCs; or 4) Vehicle. We
will use a multifaceted set of live, in vivo and ex vivo outcomes to assess joint pain, intra-articular inflammation
and protease activity, bone remodeling, and articular cartilage damage to assess PTOA severity. We will track
intra-articular retention of injected cells via live fluorescent monitoring of luciferase activity and a near-infrared
tag. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the observed autocrine and paracrine effects of the sRX2-MdCh
secretome are mediated by IL-4 and assess the mechanism by which IL-4 effects MdCh cartilage formation and
M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization."
10795048,"PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that
can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The
current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on
the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug
chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at
the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline
to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm.
An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict
the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We
hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug
associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented
linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We
utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function
model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose
fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors.
Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility
of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this
approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the
inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the
development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity.
Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches
to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that
identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose
to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The
multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to
projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological
system of the heart."
10745348,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The proposed pilot project will evaluate the efficacy of linezolid in the treatment of early syphilis. Syphilis rates
are increasing both in the US and internationally. Incidence is higher among men who have sex with men and in
individuals with HIV infection. Currently, injectable penicillin is used to treat syphilis; however, injectable penicillin
is not available in many countries. Doxycycline, tetracycline, and ceftriaxone are alternative treatments for non-
pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin. Although existing treatment alternatives are based on clinical
experience, there are a limited number of small clinical trials and case series. Each non-penicillin treatment
poses clinical challenges for administration and compliance. Repurposing already approved and safe antibiotics
could bring new, safe, and efficacious antibiotic treatment options into the clinic faster and cut down on
development costs. This pilot project focuses on studying the potential efficacy of the FDA-approved antibiotic
linezolid.
In this proposal, we will test the clinical efficacy and microbicidal activity of linezolid to establish its use as a
syphilis treatment. We will build upon our successful syphilis clinical studies to conduct a randomized, open-
label, non-comparative pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of two linezolid dosing schemes (600mg, twice a day,
for ten days or for five days) in patients. We will enroll 60 participants with early syphilis from two clinical sites in
Peru. We will follow the participants to monitor clinical progress and serological response (RPR titer) at 7, 30,
90, 180, 270 and 360 days. Our hypothesis is that linezolid will be efficacious in treating early syphilis
demonstrated by four-fold decrease in RPR titer, from enrollment to three or six months after treatment
administration, and by microbicidal activity against multiple Treponema pallidum isolates.
The two specific aims of our proposal are: AIM 1: To evaluate the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of early
syphilis. AIM 2: Evaluate the susceptibility of Treponema pallidum historical and novel strains to linezolid.
The two-year project has four phases. Phase I will last four months and will involve the development of study
instruments and staff training on recruitment, enrollment, and data collection. Phase II will last 12 months and
will involve recruitment and enrollment of patients and collection of clinical specimens. Phase III will last 24
months, but will proceed simultaneously with Phase II, and include the patient follow-up period. Phase IV will
last three months and includes data analysis and dissemination."
10757330,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Successfully increasing cessation rates among African Americans would reduce the racial disparity in mortality
between African Americans and Whites by up to 20%. Many smoking cessation interventions include physical activity
components to boost cessation rates, but no studies have attempted to promote sedentary behavior reduction as a
cessation strategy. Further, smartphones can facilitate intensive behavioral interventions without requiring burdensome
in-person treatment, and these interventions can be tailored to address the specific needs of African Americans and
capitalize on cultural strengths to reduce barriers and encourage behavior change. Our research team has developed
numerous smartphone interventions to address a range of modifiable health risk factors among vulnerable populations,
which are capable of being culturally tailored for African Americans. Of relevance to this research proposal, one is a
smartphone-based contingency management intervention that provides financial rewards for smoking abstinence after
remote verification of smoking status using low-cost portable carbon monoxide monitors and facial recognition software
(i.e., PrevailGO). The other is a smartphone-based sedentary reduction intervention that uses wrist-worn activity
monitors in combination with smartphone technology to monitor activity in real-time and deliver activity prompts when
individuals are engaged in prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior (i.e., SMARTpath). My long-term goal is to improve
smoking cessation outcomes among African Americans using evidence-based, culturally tailored smartphone
interventions. The overall objectives of this research proposal, which is the next step toward achieving this long-term
goal, are to (a) create a smartphone application for smoking cessation (i.e., HealthyCells), which will be achieved by
integrating two pre-existing evidence-based smartphone interventions, PrevailGO and SMARTpath, (b) create culturally
tailored treatment content (i.e., messages, images, and videos) for African American smokers, and (c) evaluate the
feasibility of HealthyCells at addressing smoking and sedentary behavior among African Americans. A pilot sample of
African American smokers (N = 15) will briefly use the HealthyCells app and provide critical feedback through semi-
structured interviews to refine the smartphone intervention. Once the HealthyCells app is refined, African Americans (N
= 30) who are interested in quitting smoking will use the app during a scheduled quit attempt. Starting on the scheduled
quit date, HealthyCells will prompt participants to complete twice-daily remote smoking status assessments to earn
rewards for abstinence. The app will deliver real-time messages telling participants to stand up and move around during
prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior (i.e., ≥ 30 minutes of uninterrupted time spent in a sitting, reclining, or lying
posture). Participants will also have on-demand access to culturally tailored information and strategies for remaining
abstinent and reducing sedentary behavior within the HealthyCells app. The primary outcomes will be biochemically
confirmed point prevalence smoking abstinence at 8 weeks post-quit date, and the difference in sedentary time 7
consecutive days before quitting compared with 7 consecutive days at 8-weeks post-quit, as measured by a research-
grade accelerometer."
10796784,"Project Summary
 Symptom management and supportive care are essential to high-quality cancer care and optimal patient
outcomes, but many barriers exist to their integration in routine oncology settings. Despite the availability and
cost-effectiveness of validated symptom assessment tools, evidence-based supportive care interventions and
clinical guidelines, adoption of supportive care using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice remains low,
leaving many patients with poor symptom control, unmet needs, and preventable suffering. Patient-reported
outcomes offer one approach to symptom assessment by capturing the unique needs and values of each patient.
This strategy is effective in identifying patients' needs, but does not necessarily help oncology providers address
and manage these needs in their clinical interactions. Novel approaches are needed to facilitate systematic
symptom assessment and management, and guide the appropriate provision of supportive care in real-world
oncology settings.
 To address this critical gap in cancer care, this project will involve the development and pilot testing of a
supportive care tool, embedded in the existing electronic health record, that collects patient-reported
assessments of symptoms and supportive care needs, using well-established tools, and links these data to a
system of evidence-based algorithms for supportive care. Specific aims of this project are: 1) to develop the
content, design and technical infrastructure of an EHR-integrated supportive care tool, based on a pre-
intervention assessment of stakeholder input and the local context; 2) to implement the EHR-integrated
supportive care tool over an [18-month] intervention period in 5 HNCP outpatient clinics, with potential exposure
of the tool to more than [300] eligible HNC patients and clinicians; and 3) to evaluate the [feasibility, acceptability,
and] initial implementation of the EHR-integrated supportive care tool using a mixed methods approach. Findings
from this project will provide the preliminary data to inform the design of a larger pragmatic randomized trial
across multiple cancer clinics.
 The proposed K08 Career Development Award is designed to support the candidate's advanced training in
cancer care delivery research, with formal training in the fields of clinical informatics and implementation science,
while developing and pilot testing an electronic supportive care tool for use in routine oncology care. These broad
goals are consistent with the National Cancer Institute's mission and scientific priorities."
10770406,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Autophagy is a self-degradation pathway that has tissue-specific functions in erythropoiesis. During erythroid
differentiation, autophagy facilitates the degradation of macromolecules and the programmed clearance of
mitochondria. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine how autophagy contributes to normal and
impaired erythropoiesis. Patients with Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) often have impaired erythropoiesis
and mitochondrial dysfunction. A subset of MDS, MDS with ring sideroblasts (RS), contain the aberrant
accumulation of iron-laden mitochondria in erythroblasts suggesting that autophagy may be dysregulated in
hematopoietic disorders and impair erythroid differentiation. While essential autophagy genes are known to
contribute to autophagy in erythropoiesis, little is known about the tissue-specific regulation of autophagy during
human erythroid differentiation. We have identified the selective expression of the autophagy protease ATG4A
in the erythroid lineage. We have evaluated the contribution of ATG4A in an ex vivo model of human erythroid
differentiation. Early in differentiation, ATG4A promotes the expansion and colony formation of erythroid
progenitors. Late in differentiation, ATG4A promotes terminal maturation, enucleation, and mitochondrial
clearance. Since ATG4 proteases are regulated by reactive oxygen species, the function of ATG4A in
erythropoiesis may be sensitive to oxidative stress. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that
ATG4A mediates autophagy during early and late erythropoiesis and is dysregulated by oxidative stress. In aim
1, we will identify the role of ATG4A-dependent autophagy in early erythropoiesis. In aim 2, we will determine
the mechanism of ATG4A-dependent mitochondrial clearance. In aim 3, we will examine the regulation of
mitochondrial clearance in human models of MDS-RS. The experiments outlined in this proposal will be
conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Sergei Doulatov, an expert in the development and use of human iPSC
models to study erythroid disorders, and co-mentorship of Dr. Janis Abkowitz, Chair of the Division of
Hematology at the University of Washington and international expert in MDS and erythroid biology. This career
development award will support my training to become an independent investigator studying the contribution of
autophagy to normal and dysfunctional erythropoiesis."
10772982,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Despite recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, solid tumors remain largely refractory to treatment due to
disruption of immune homeostasis by the tumor microenvironment (TME). Within the TME, a combination of
hypoxia, acidity, suppressive cells, and immune checkpoints leads to poor differentiation of type I effector cells,
preventing the development of a robust immune response. IL12 is a naturally produced cytokine that can directly
induce type I, cell-mediated immunity through the IL12Rβ1/IL12Rβ2 complex on innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)
and T cells. IL12 has been remarkably successful against solid tumors in preclinical trials, but its clinical
development has been impaired by lethal toxicity due to systemic immune overactivation. I have developed a
novel IL12-based prodrug (proIL12) that displays no noticeable toxicity in vivo but maintains full antitumor
efficacy. The kinetics and cellular mechanism of proIL12 must still be ascertained, but preliminary data suggests
T cells play a critical role and IFNγ is the main cytokine induced. Therefore, I hypothesize that proIL12 circulates
in inert prodrug form until activated by tumor-specific enzymes, at which point it activates T cells directly through
IL12 receptor and secondarily through IFNγ production. To test my hypothesis, I will first validate proIL12’s drug
profile by determining an optimal dosing schedule, monitoring tumor-specific activation, and measuring toxicity.
Then, I will explore which specific cell subtypes among ILCs and T cells are necessary to reject tumors. Finally,
I will independently assess the downstream role of IFNγ in coordinating the proIL12 response. By systematically
characterizing both physical and mechanistic properties of proIL12, I will not only prepare it for further clinical
development but also inform future steps such as combination therapies or prognostic markers. As a whole, my
study will produce a tolerable immunotherapeutic agent capable of reversing TME-induced immune disarray to
eliminate solid tumors."
10773158,"Abstract
Despite the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the varying state-level mitigation policies it triggered much
remains unknown regarding the effects on a multitude of life domains, including the health and well-being of
American families. There is a need for more dynamic and timely data to track how Americans are responding to
the pandemic. Due to the deterioration and defunding of the marriage and divorce vital statistics system, recent
monthly state-level marriage and divorce data are not available from one source in analysis-friendly formats
crippling our capacity to understand geographic variation in marriage and divorce at an unprecedented time in
world history. While the availability of some health and vital statistics data has become widespread throughout
this crisis, high-quality data on the pandemic effects on marriage behavior have not been accessible, let alone
kept pace. Existing survey data, such as that collected via the American Community Survey has been
compromised due to low response rates and high nonresponse bias. Further, they do not provide monthly data.
No centralized location or agency is responsible for providing monthly administrative data on marriage and
divorce at the state level. Calls for attention on the effects of structural determinants (e.g., political, legal, policy,
and economic) at the state-level have come from several constituent groups. Despite the spotlighted importance
of state-level, timely data, and efforts of individual researchers to fill this gap, dynamic temporal, and spatial
variation in how the pandemic has affected marriage and divorce patterns since March of 2020 remain unknown.
Our objective is to continue our past efforts in archiving administrative marriages and divorce data and expand
those efforts to archive monthly state-level marriage and divorce counts, compute monthly adjusted marriage
and divorce rates at the state-level and disseminate these data in widely accessible manner enabling the usage
by the broader research community, program staff, and practitioner communities. These efforts will enable
researchers to link marriage and divorce data to existing data—a specifical designated purpose of this program
announcement. Our third and final aim will be to disseminate the data via the National Center for Family &
Marriage Research and the Data Sharing for Demographic Research websites. The dissemination will increase
awareness of these valuable data across many potential data users. This innovative project fits squarely with
the PDB mission to enhance knowledge and data availability on families and households. This, in turn, is
expected to enhance currently available data and increase their potential scientific impact through increased
accessibility and efficiency. The application is consistent with the purpose of the R03 mechanism and this specific
program announcement and will offer a resource to a multidisciplinary set of researchers, policy makers, and
practitioners."
10746837,"One of the hallmark, chronic, features of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI) is the deposition of phosphorylated tau in neurons. Tau
lesions are also one of the main hallmark features of ADRD. It remains unknown what specific molecular triggers precipitate
the path towards this distinct TBI related neurodegenerative phenotype. The E4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD;
individuals carrying 1 copy have a 2-3 fold risk for AD, while those with 2 copies have a 15-fold risk compared to E3 carriers.
Despite some contradictory studies, the E4 allele has long been associated with a poor outcome after TBI, but the role played
by APOE in response to TBI is still unknown and well-designed longitudinal studies are needed. Conducting such studies in
humans remains challenging as epidemiological and prospective data are lacking, plus the heterogeneity of TBI etiology,
including (but not limited to) severity level, age, comorbidities and time post-TBI, present an enormously confounding
problem. Thus, the best way to address this question is in translationally relevant, well characterized and controlled animal
models, wherein key predisposing genetic factors can be targeted and expressed, and findings from longitudinal analyses can
be related to the limited autopsy information from human TBI cases who have died at different timepoints after their injury.
We have developed and characterized such mouse models of r-mTBI, which recapitulate many features of human TBI
pathology. In recent work, we have exposed human APOE-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR), mice humanized for Tau
(TauKI) and crosses of these mice (E-Tau) to our r-mTBI paradigm, and observe TBI-dependent pTau pathology. From these
studies we have also revealed that the E4 allele augments the proinflammatory microglial response and Tau pathology in
injured mice compared to E3. APOE is upregulated in disease associated microglia, which has been reported in AD brains. In
our r-mTBI model we have also confirmed an increase in microglial specific APOE gene expression. Disease associated
microglia have been reported to drive the outcome and pace of APOE4-dependent neurodegeneration in AD transgenic
models; yet very little is known about their contribution in driving APOE4 mediated effects after r-mTBI. We will address these
unknowns using mouse models
expressing human forms of
APOE/Tau, and expose them to our r-mTBI paradigm to address
these timely and under-studied interactions. We will first expose these models topharmacological manipulation of microglia
using depopulation/repopulation paradigms to delineate their contribution to the APOE influence on r-mTBI pathogenesis
and tau pathology. In the next part of the study, we will use an inducible APOE-KI model to genetically manipulate
to delineate their contribution to the APOE influence on microglial
TBI mediated neurodegeneration, tau pathology and behavioral outcome.

specific APOE expression transcriptomic phenotypes and
ex vivo functional activities, We will finally compare
TBI-dependent microglial transcriptomic responses in the presence or absence of APOE deletion in this model to reveal
microglial specific targets that correlate with favorable outcomes after r-mTBI and represent novel therapeutic targets. We will
confirm the translational relevance of our targets in r-mTBI/control autopsy cases from different APOE backgrounds. Our
future work will interrogate the functional and therapeutic roles of these targets. This study is much needed as a first step in
deciphering the role of APOE4 in microglia pathobiology after r-mTBI, which is currently under-investigated."

Non-communicable diseases account for 71% of all deaths globally. Yet, training opportunities for research in
global cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, pulmonary, and hematologic diseases are limited. Critical questions
involve understanding optimal treatment and implementation programs to improve health and reduce disease,
key differences among populations in pathobiology and treatment responses, and relevant environmental and
socio-behavioral factors that influence disease progression globally. The program developed in this proposal,
Research Training in Global Non-Communicable Diseases, is designed to provide post-doctoral fellows at
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) with outstanding opportunities to obtain research skills and high-
quality mentorship to prepare for research careers addressing global cardiovascular, cardiometabolic,
pulmonary, and hematologic diseases. Key activities for fellows in the training program include the Program in
Clinical Effectiveness (a rigorous summer program designed explicitly for postdoctoral physicians) and other
coursework relevant for global health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We will also instruct
fellows on global health research implementation and administration as well as career development through
program-based seminars and courses in the MGH Division of Clinical Research. Additional professional
development resources will be available through multiple MGH-based initiatives and the Harvard Catalyst. The
proposed program will also support a Community of Practice to promote connections among the fellows, their
mentors, and other global health researchers for professional development and wellness. Additionally, the
committed and talented group of mentors available to the fellows will receive advanced training in mentorship
to optimize the effectiveness in supporting the fellows. Importantly, the program will strive for diversity among
its fellows and promote equity within global health partnerships. Our aims are as follows:
 1. Provide mentored research in high-impact global health research of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic,
 pulmonary, and hematologic diseases to develop the next generation of global health investigators
 2. Conduct research training through coursework and seminars that is enriched through a Community of
 Practice model among global health investigators
 3. Train mentors to optimize the success of supported trainees working in global health research.
The Research Training in Global Non-Communicable Diseases Program will support a total of eight fellows
(two per year), each receiving two years of research support, didactic training, and intense and purposeful
research and career mentorship. The program aims to prepare all fellows for research careers, including
career development and transition to independent NIH-funded research. Impact of the program will be
measured through the quality of mentorship, as well as the productivity and advancement of the fellows."
10818328,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Glaucoma drainage device (GDD) surgery has gained popularity in managing patients with medically
uncontrolled glaucoma. However, one of the major long-term complications of GDD is progressive corneal
endothelial cell loss (ECL) leading to corneal decompensation, which requires complex care. Although surgical
techniques have been modified to insert the tube into the ciliary sulcus to address this issue, anterior chamber
(AC) tube placement remains the preferred location, as there is a lack of convincing data to validate the
advantages of sulcus placement. For example, (1) Direct comparison of endothelial cell loss (ECL) after sulcus
versus AC tube placement is limited to three retrospective studies; (2) Studies are inconsistent regarding
whether intraocular pressure (IOP) and other surgical outcomes are similar after sulcus tube or AC tube
placement; (3) Question remains whether a sulcus tube cause more AC microenvironment change due to
higher chance of having chronic tube-iris touch than an AC tube, jeopardizing endothelial cell health, IOP
control, or other surgical outcomes of the sulcus tube.
 To answer these questions, we propose a multi-center, outcome-masked clinical trial randomizing 240
subjects to sulcus tube versus AC tube placement. In this trial, we will compare ECL (specific aim 1), IOP
control (specific aim 2) and AC microenvironment (specific aim 3) after GDD implantation with tube placement
in the ciliary sulcus versus the anterior chamber. In the setting of increased use of GDDs, our proposed trial to
identify better approaches to decrease its corneal complications is of substantial interest to both corneal and
glaucoma specialists.
 Department of Ophthalmology at University of California San Francisco (UCSF), Francis I. Proctor
Foundation at UCSF, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), and 4 high-volume centers for GDD implantation will
jointly execute this trial. The Department of Ophthalmology at UCSF will serve as Clinical Coordinating Center.
UPenn will be the Data Coordinating Center. Francis I. Proctor Foundation will be the imaging reading center
and metagenomic RNA deep sequencing analysis (MDS) center.
 This trial is innovative for a number of reasons including the randomization of surgery (sulcus tube
versus AC tube) and application of novel MDS analysis (examining postoperative AC microenvironment), none
of which has been prospectively studied before. It is aligned with the priorities of the NEI, studying high-
resolution imaging techniques such as endothelial cell imaging and anterior-segment optical coherence to
guide post-operative treatment and as potential surrogate trial endpoints in future trials. This world class team
of collaborators have a proven track record for executing large NEI-funded trials in ophthalmology, and are well
positioned to answer the important questions presented in this proposal."
10754268,"Project Summary/Abstract
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single leading cause of death in the United States. Coronary
revascularization, including coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention, is the most
common modality in patients with CHD. However, it is often associated with a high incidence of restenosis.
Although the rate of restenosis is reduced significantly by using bare-metal stent (BMS) and particularly with
drug-eluting stent (DES), a persistently high rate of restenosis after BMS and an increased risk of in-stent
thrombosis with DES has been encountered as a major significant gap in the field. The current application
proposes to bridge this gap and specifically investigates the role of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) BMAL1 in
neointimal hyperplasia in mouse models of arterial injury. BMAL1 is a core molecular component of the
circadian clock. It has long been believed that loss of function of BMAL1 is detrimental to well-being. However,
this dogma was challenged by our recent report that genetic deletion of Bmal1 in SMCs (SM-Bmal1-KO)
protects mice from aldosterone or angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm. Consistent with this
finding, our preliminary demonstrate that SMC-specific Bmal1 deletion also protects mice femoral artery wire
injury- or carotid artery ligation-induced neointimal hyperplasia. While the underlying mechanism remains
elusive, our preliminary data reveal arachidonic acid metabolism is most significantly affected by SMC-specific
Bmal1 deletion. Interestingly, among enzymes implicated in arachidonic acid metabolism, cytosolic
phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2) is most downregulated by SMC-specific Bmal1 deletion. Mechanistically, our
preliminary data illustrate that BMAL1 binds to the mouse cPLA2 promoter, and SMC BMAL1 is required for
vascular injury-induced cPLA2 upregulation in neointima. Given the potential role of cPLA2 in VSMC
proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia, we hypothesize that upregulation of BMAL1 in SMCs by vascular
injury promotes cPLA2 expression, thus mediating the initiation and progression of neointimal hyperplasia and
significantly contributing to the development of restenosis after coronary revascularization. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that upregulation of SMC BMAL1 by vascular injury is critical for the onset and progression of
neointimal hyperplasia. Aim 2 will define the mechanism by which SMC BMAL1 regulates cPLA2 and thereby
mediates vascular injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia. To achieve the goals, SM-Bmal1-KO, SM-cPLA2-
KO, and SM-Bmal1/cPLA2-KO mice will be subjected to femoral artery wire injury or carotid artery ligation to
induce neointimal hyperplasia and to determine the mechanism by which SMC BMAL1 and cPLA2 mediate
vascular injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia. Results from the proposed studies will provide new mechanistic
insight on how SMC BMAL1 mediates vascular injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia via cPLA2. Moreover,
results from the proposed studies will provide preclinical evidence that inhibiting the BMAL1/cPLA2 signaling
at the lesion site is a new therapeutic strategy against restenosis after coronary revascularization."

This proposal will test key aspects of the roles of TDP-43 proteinopathy and endogenous
retroviruses in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia and
Alzheimer’s and related dementias. This proposal will test, in a mammalian model, the hypothesis
that reactivation of retrotransposons (RTEs) is a means for neurodegeneration and dementia
through the following actions: (1) TDP-43 toxicity causes RTE activation in neurons and glia, (2)
the effects of TDP-43 on RTEs are non-cell autonomous, and (3) RTEs contribute to toxicity and
non-cell autonomy. This proposal will also establish a first-ever mammalian platform to investigate
TDP- 43 and RTEs in an established neurodegeneration/dementia model, the TDP-43-Q331K
mutant mouse. Two complementary approaches will be used to investigate the role of TDP-43 in
retrotransposon biology. First, a low-expressing Tg-hTDP-43-Q331K, but not a low-expressing
Tg-hTPD43-WT model, develops motor dysfunction and loss of spinal motor neurons. Second,
high overexpression of TDP-43 in either neurons or astrocytes through localized AAV brain
injections provides the means to investigate non-cell autonomous signaling between neurons and
glia. By driving overexpression only in neurons or glia with AAV virus, the effects of TDP-43
pathology on RTE expression will also be determined, and the non-cell autonomous spread of
toxic effects between these cell types. Finally, the relationship of soluble oligomerization to the
disease phenotypes will be determined, allowing the pursuit of additional translational
investigations into the potential use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and disaggregase
compounds for alleviating or delaying progression of disease."
10757415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anthracyclines and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted agents have improved overall
breast cancer control and survival; however, the benefits of these cancer therapies are offset by cardiovascular
(CV) toxicity that can occur acutely during therapy or years after completion. Our group has shown that
chemotherapy for primary breast cancer causes both direct injury to the cardiac-lung-skeletal muscle axis (e.g.
cytotoxic/targeted/radiation therapy-associated injury) and secondary adverse effects (e.g. deconditioning,
sarcopenia) which lead to significant declines in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), an integrative measure of
global cardiopulmonary function. We recently completed the Optimal Timing Trial, a randomized, open-label
trial evaluating the tolerability and effects of three different AT sequencing strategies versus physical activity
(PA) advice control on CRF in 158 women with early stage (I–III) breast cancer undergoing primary adjuvant or
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCI R01CA164751, NCT01943695). The results demonstrated that AT during and
after chemotherapy was safe and attenuated CRF decline compared to PA advice. However, a fundamental
question related to AT is whether it is an effective strategy to mitigate the direct cardiac injury from
anthracyclines and HER2-targeted therapy. To address this knowledge gap, we propose an ancillary biomarker
study to the Optimal Timing Trial and will include CV biomarkers that are used for early detection of subclinical
cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment and predictive of subsequent cardiac dysfunction. The overall objective
of the proposed study is to determine the effects of AT during cardiotoxic breast cancer treatment on
correlative measures of CV injury, stress, and inflammation. We will study a subset of 69 patients treated with
anthracycline chemotherapy (with or without HER2-targeted therapy) who had blood samples collected pre-
and post-chemotherapy (n = 138 total samples). The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the effect of AT on
changes in CV biomarkers of myocardial injury (high-sensitivity troponin-I, cardiac cell-free DNA), stress (N-
terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide), and inflammation (CXCL10, IL-6); and (2) explore factors that modify
the effect of AT on changes in CV biomarkers. The results of the study will provide insights on the impact of AT
to prevent adverse CV effects of breast cancer therapy, improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of AT-induced physiologic adaptation, and inform the design of future studies to mitigate the CV toxicity of
cancer treatment."

Lung cancer continues to be a significant health burden in the U.S. Thus, a functional understanding of the
critical molecules during NSCLC oncogenesis will enhance our knowledge of its malignant transformation, and
allow novel therapeutic strategies.
We have recently identified critical roles of protein function effector sncRNAs (pfeRNAs) in the tumorigenesis
and differentiation of NSCLC, have described their functions in the basic biology of NSCLC, and have
elucidated their structural and functional features. We have identified eight pfeRNAs as promising non-invasive
biomarkers using sncRNAs deep sequencing by analyzing 108 biospecimens, including (i) plasma from healthy
controls, (ii) plasma from patients with Stage I/II NSCLC with matched biopsy-proven NSCLC tissue as well as
histologically normal adjacent lung tissue, and (iii) plasma from patients with both biopsy-proven benign and
malignant lung nodules. We have already validated these biomarkers in 352 clinical biospecimens, including
77 healthy controls, 44 patients with benign disease, and 231 patients with malignant lung nodules. These
eight pfeRNAs were able to: (1) to differentiate patients with or without pulmonary nodules, with a sensitivity
and specificity up to 98.1% and 100%, respectively; (2) to differentiate patients who had malignant versus
benign pulmonary nodules, with a sensitivity and a specificity up to 78% and 78.8%, respectively. Furthermore,
we identified a pfeRNA is ADC-specific and two pfeRNAs are SCC-specific. Besides, we have confirmed
functional analyses of these three pfeRNAs one by one and identified their roles in the primary biological
activities of ADC, SCC, and HBE cells in vitro. In addition, we specified the cellular distribution of these three
pfeRNAs by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. The data strongly suggest that these three
pfeRNAs play critical roles in tumorigenesis and cancer development of NSCLC. Thus, in this project, we will
identify the target proteins of these three pfeRNAs and investigate the mechanisms underlying the interaction
with the target proteins. This project will provide new evidence on NSCLC oncogenesis."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health concern defined by pathologic changes in the brain that
coincide with altered behavior and cognitive function. Animal models have advanced our understanding of AD,
but these models artificially induce neuropathy to simulate the human disease. For instance, while amyloid-
beta (Aβ) deposition occurs in most mammals, tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) have only been
identified in a few nonhuman species studied to date. Our research team recently discovered that chimpanzees,
one of our closest genetic relatives, naturally develop both Aβ plaques and NFT, the pathological hallmarks of
AD. In addition to AD pathology, elderly chimpanzees also develop cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a
neurovascular condition found in 80% of AD patients associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, additional
studies in chimpanzees could shed new light on the etiology of AD and CAA, leading to potentially new
directions for therapeutic interventions. The overall goals of the proposed studies are to further examine the
pathologic, epigenetic, and cognitive characteristics of aging, CAA, and AD in chimpanzees. In Aim 1, we will
perform comprehensive pathologic analyses aimed at quantifying biomarkers of CAA and AD, including Aβ40
and Aβ42 plaque and vessel volumes, NFT density, pericyte and smooth muscle cell vessel volumes, neuron and
synapse densities, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The collective neuropathologic measures will be examined
in a sample of chimpanzees for which antemortem cognitive data is available, and the main focus will be
determining which pathologic markers best predict individual variation in cognition. Moreover, we will test the
correlation of AD and CAA pathologies with inflammatory processes, such as microglial activation and
astrogliosis. In Aim 2, we will quantify epigenetic age in the chimpanzee population and evaluate whether
chimpanzees with CAA or AD lesions demonstrate accelerated epigenetic aging in the brain relative to apes
without pathology. We also will determine if epigenetic age is a better predictor than chronological age of
changes in cognition, region-specific gray matter volume, and white matter integrity and connectivity. Finally,
though previous studies have found cross-sectional age differences in cognition in chimpanzees, we will
determine whether chimpanzees show longitudinal changes in cognition and whether any age-related loss in
performance predicts the subsequent expression of AD pathology in this proposal. All biomaterials and
cognitive data obtained in the proposed studies will be added to the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource and
made publicly available to the scientific community through a web portal. The proposed studies, in their
entirety, will fill an important gap in our knowledge about the comparative biology of aging and disease in
chimpanzees and may provide critical translational insight into how those processes contribute to the
progression of CAA and AD in humans. This information will provide crucial direction for future translational
studies using rodent and nonhuman primate models."
10772976,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transformation by the BCR-
ABL tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are effective in inducing remission and prolonging survival
in CML patients, but fail to eliminate primitive leukemia stem cells (LSC) that can regenerate disease. Most
patients need ongoing TKI treatment to maintain remission, and remain at risk of toxicity, financial hardship and
non-adherence. The long-term goal of our research is to improve understanding of mechanisms of LSC
resistance to treatment, to support development of effective and safe strategies for LSC targeting, and enhance
possibilities of treatment-free remissions in CML patients. Mitochondrial metabolism plays a critical regulatory
role in normal HSC function. CML LSC demonstrate increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) compared to low OXPHOS in normal HSC. However, mitochondria also play important roles in
metabolic processes besides OXPHOS, including fatty acid, glutamine and glucose oxidation, and generation of
biosynthetic intermediates. The rationale for our studies is that specific mitochondrial metabolic alterations that
contribute to altered LSC growth and TKI resistance are not known. Our preliminary studies show initial inhibition
of OXPHOS in CML LSC after TKI treatment, but subsequent restoration of OXPHOS, and increased fatty acid
oxidation (FAO), with continued treatment. A SIRT1, P53 and MYC regulatory network plays an important role
in LSC propagation. We show that SIRT1 and its target PGC-1α play an important role in increased OXPHOS in
CML LSC. PPARa, a PGC-1α-coactivated transcription factor and a key regulator of FAO, shows increased
expression in CML LSC after TKI treatment, and contributes to increased OXPHOS, proliferation and survival.
We will explore the hypothesis that increased FAO following BCR-ABL kinase inhibition, together with
maintenance of high levels of OXPHOS, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, contributes to TKI resistance in CML
LSC, and that metabolic regulatory mechanisms represent potential targets for elimination of TKI-treated CML
LSC. In Specific Aim 1 we will use a combination of gene expression, extracellular flux, metabolite profiling and
in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling to study effects of TKI treatment on mitochondrial metabolism in CML LSC,
examine the role of SIRT1, PGC1a and PPARa in metabolic alterations, and study interactions of MYC and p53
regulatory networks with mitochondrial metabolism. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate the role of increased
OXPHOS and FAO in promoting TKI resistance in CML LSC. Bone marrow microenvironment niches play a
critical role in maintaining quiescent, TKI-resistant LSC populations. However, the role of the microenvironment
in metabolic regulation of LSC growth is not known, and will be evaluated here . These studies are significant
since they are expected to identify mechanisms of metabolic regulation underlying TKI resistance in CML LSC,
establish connections between metabolism and other regulatory mechanisms in CML LSC, and identify new
targets for therapy. The concepts developed here will have broad implications for other malignancies."
10789933,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common pathogen that has infected a majority of the human population. While symptoms of HCMV are generally resolved in immunocompetent individuals, the virus remains for the lifetime within the host as a latent infection is established in the hematopoietic stem cells. HCMV has co- evolved with humans and as such, the virus as adapted to undermine host cell antiviral responses. How HCMV undermines these responses is not fully known. Our research has found that an understudied protein modification, S-nitrosylation, plays a role in how HCMV interacts with the antiviral response. We found that viral proteins critical for efficient lytic replication are post translationally modified with nitric oxide groups and that the resulting modifications alter the viral proteins ability to limit antiviral responses. We propose to mechanistically investigate how these modifications impact HCMV protein functions and to identify the impact of S-nitrosylation on HCMV replication. Completion of the aims above will contribute significantly to our knowledge the regulation of biological functions of critical viral factors as well as identify the mechanism by which viruses weaken host defenses against infection. This work will lay the foundation in identifying novel therapeutic targets for a pathogen that lacks a vaccine or a cure."

The United States is one of the world’s leading producers of chromium compounds. According to the National
Tap Water quality database and Environmental Working Group report, ~74 million people in the U.S in nearly
7,000 communities drink water contaminated with hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), and they are predisposed to
various health problems including infertility, pre-term labor, pre-mature abortion, intrauterine fetal growth
restriction, and cancers. A study was conducted using data released from the hospital records of newborn babies
and pregnant women from Willits, CA, exposed to Cr(VI). For the first time, the detrimental reproductive effects
from non-occupational Cr(VI) exposure in human females and their infants was reported in the U.S. Our study
involving the human placenta reported a positive correlation between Cr accumulation in the term placenta (from
Michigan women) and increased oxidative stress. However, how Cr(VI) causes abnormal placental development,
and pregnancy disorders is unknown. The uterine spiral artery is extensively remodeled to deliver a sufficient
supply of maternal blood and nutrients to the developing fetus. Abnormal uterine spiral artery remodeling
adversely affects pregnancy. The current study hypothesizes that Cr(VI) disrupts uterine spiral artery remodeling
by inhibiting trophoblast cell invasion and altering growth factor(s)-mediated signaling pathways. For the first
time, our preliminary study demonstrates Cr(VI)-induced thickness of uterine artery wall and narrowing of the
artery lumen. Cr(VI) inhibited trophoblast cell invasion into the uterine-fetal interface. To conduct the current
project, timed pregnant rats (8-10 wk of age) will be divided into four experimental groups: Control (n=10), Cr(VI)
- 0.1 ppm (n=10), Cr(VI) - 1.0 ppm (n=10), and Cr(VI) - 5.0 ppm (n=10), and exposed to respective doses of
potassium dichromate (Cr(VI)) from GD 9.5 to 12.5 and euthanized on GD18.5. AIM-1 will determine the
placental and fetal weight, resorption sites, the number of male and female pups, placentas shape, and live and
dead pups. Effects of Cr(VI) exposure on spatio-temporal expression of signaling molecules in regulating
trophoblast invasion. AIM-2 will identify the mechanism of Cr(VI) on the myogenic response of the uterine main
artery and its extracellular matrix. Uterine main arteries will be dissected from the pregnant rats treated with
Cr(VI). The contractile responses, endothelial-dependent relaxation responses, active pressure
responses, internal and external diameter, wall thickness, cross-sectional area, and wall strain will be calculated
using pressure and wire myographs. In Study 2b, the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins network of the uterine
artery will be determined. The current study is innovative to fill the gap in understanding the role of Cr(VI) in
altering uterine vascular adaptation during pregnancy. These findings will help regulate Cr(VI) exposure in
pregnant women since they are vulnerable to EDCs’ exposure."
10754950,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to understand how the tetraspanin family member CD53 protects hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) from inflammatory stress. While important for normal immune system function, inflammatory
signaling can impair HSC function and promote the development of hematopoietic malignancies. In preliminary
data, we identified CD53 as a critical regulator of HSC function in the context of inflammatory stress. CD53 is a
member of the tetraspanin family of transmembrane proteins that organize multi-protein networks to regulate a
wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival. While normally expressed at very
low levels in HSCs, CD53 is markedly upregulated in response to multiple stressors including inflammatory
cytokines, toll like receptor agonists and mobilizing agents. Using our newly-generated Cd53-/- mouse, we found
that loss of CD53 causes a significant reduction in HSC repopulating ability and increased cycling in the face of
inflammatory stress. RNA sequencing and proximity labeling studies suggest that CD53 promotes HSC
quiescence in response to inflammation via activation of “DREAM,” a transcriptional repressor complex involving
the Rb-like family members p107/Rbl1 and p130/Rbl2 that inhibits the expression of cell cycle genes in response
to p53 and p21 activation. Based on this data, we hypothesize that CD53 promotes DREAM complex-mediated
repression of cell cycle-related genes in HSCs in response to inflammatory stress, thereby promoting HSC
quiescence and protecting HSC function. Notably, CD53 expression is markedly increased in HSCs deficient for
Tet2 or Dnmt3a. Mutations in these epigenome regulators are commonly associated with age-related clonal
hematopoiesis (CH), which involves inflammation-driven expansion of mutant HSCs and increased risk of
leukemic transformation. We predict that CD53 may thus promote the clonal advantage of mutant HSCs in CH.
Using a combination of proteomic, transcriptomic and in vivo HSC functional tools, we will: 1) Determine the role
of CD53 in promoting HSC function in response to inflammatory stimuli; 2) Determine how CD53 regulates HSC
cycling and DREAM complex activity; and 3) Determine whether elevated CD53 promotes the clonal advantage
of mutant HSCs. We will perform overexpression studies to elucidate the effects of sustained CD53 expression
on HSC function, and DREAM knockout mice will be used to determine the role of this complex in mediating the
effects of CD53 on HSCs. We will determine the mechanisms by which CD53 regulates HSC cycling and DREAM
activation using proximity ligation assays to characterize CD53- interacting partners. Finally, we will perform
functional studies and chimeric modeling experiments using Cd53 and Dnmt3a knockout mice to determine
whether CD53 promotes the clonal expansion of mutant HSCs. Together, our proposed studies will describe a
novel mechanism that enables HSCs to resist inflammatory stress. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms
by which both normal and mutant HSCs resist inflammatory stress is essential to the development of therapeutic
strategies to promote healthy HSC function and to prevent the expansion of mutant HSCs in CH."

 Developmental defects in eye structure commonly account for visual impairment in newborns. Proper eye
structure is initially established via the process of optic cup morphogenesis, during which a series of complex
cell and tissue rearrangements transforms the optic vesicle into the optic cup, with neural retina and retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) enwrapping the newly formed lens.
 With advances in imaging and computational analysis, work from our lab and others has begun to reveal the
cellular events underlying optic cup morphogenesis, however, molecular control of these processes still remains
poorly understood. A compelling candidate to play a role in controlling optic cup morphogenesis is the
extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex, glycoprotein-rich layer that regulates cell survival, movement, signaling,
and polarity. Mutations in certain ECM components can lead to ocular pathologies, such as coloboma,
suggesting specific requirements during optic cup morphogenesis. Understanding extrinsic control of
morphogenesis also has implications for organoid approaches and strategies. Our previous data indicate that a
core molecule, laminin, elicits diverse cellular responses in different eye regions. We also found that separate
eye domains are exposed to distinct ECM microenvironments, some of which are assembled via tissue-tissue
interactions: specifically, neural crest is required to build basement membrane around the RPE. These data
suggest that unique ECM microenvironments may be a crucial driver of regional eye morphogenetic events.
 Zebrafish provide an ideal model system to study this process: optical transparency and rapid development
offer a unique opportunity to directly observe and molecularly dissect eye formation in vivo. We previously
developed 4-dimensional imaging and computational techniques to track and visualize cell movements
throughout optic cup morphogenesis, and recently, methods for automated quantitative analysis of retinal cell
size, shape and orientation. This puts us in a unique position to analyze specific morphogenetic defects arising
when particular matrix components are disrupted. In this proposal, we will dissect the region-specific roles of
ECM factors, including nidogens, tenascin-C, mmp2, and versican, during eye morphogenesis.
 We hypothesize that dynamic, region-specific ECM microenvironments elicit unique developmental and
morphogenetic responses from distinct eye progenitor domains to drive optic cup morphogenesis. Combining
molecular genetics with innovative 4-dimensional live imaging and computational methods, we will test this
hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1) determine how ECM microenvironment controls retina
morphogenesis and organization; (2) determine how ECM modulatory factors control RPE morphogenesis; and
(3) determine functional requirements for tissue contributions to specific ECM microenvironments. The
experiments proposed will define the spatiotemporal dynamics of ECM activity and distinct cellular functions
executed by region-specific ECM factors during crucial steps of eye formation."

10796816,"ABSTRACT:
All eukaryotic cells require cholesterol (Chol) for survival, and regulate their steady-state levels by balancing de
novo synthesis, uptake of Chol-containing lipoproteins, and Chol efflux (i.e., “Chol homeostasis”). Our current
understanding of Chol homeostasis in the retina remains rudimentary. Hereditary defects in Chol synthesis
comprise a family of severe, often lethal, metabolic disorders, e.g., Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS).
SLOS involves defective conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to Chol, which is catalyzed by DHCR7 (7-
dehydrocholesterol reductase). Treating rats with a DHCR7 inhibitor (e.g., AY9944) causes progressive,
irreversible retinal degeneration: the photoreceptors (PRs) preferentially degenerate and die, and RPE cells
also exhibit autophagy/heterophagy defects. However, off-target effects of DHCR7 inhibitors cannot be
obviated, and no viable genetic mouse models of SLOS are available. We have generated two novel, viable,
conditional allele models of SLOS, allowing targeted ablation of either Dhcr7 exon 8, or separately exon 9, to
partially or completely block DHCR7 in selective cell types and tissues. We hypothesize that de novo Chol
synthesis by retinal neurons alone is insufficient to maintain their viability and functionality; rather, they rely
upon Chol uptake from blood-borne (liver-derived) lipoproteins, Müller glia, and/or the RPE to meet their sterol
demands. Also, that disruption of normal Chol homeostasis provokes defective phagolysosomal biology in the
RPE and retina. We will test our hypothesis as follows: In Aim 1, we will selectively knock out Dhcr7 in rod
PRs and, separately, in Müller glia (or in tandem) and then assess the impact on sterol composition of outer
segments and optic nerve, as well as retinal structure/function; in Aim 2, we will generate panretinal knock-out
(KO) of Dhcr7 or, separately (and in tandem), in liver (hepatocytes) and then assess the impact on sterol
composition retina, liver, and blood. Using these resources, and a stable isotope approach, we will estimate
retinal sterol synthesis, uptake and turnover rates; and in Aim 3, we will use RPE and liver-specific Dhcr7 KO
mice to assess the effect of de novo 7DHC synthesis and its uptake on RPE phagocytic function. We will
model the observed SLOS RPE pathology using patient iPSC-derived RPE cells (multiple clones, with
appropriate controls), and screen for candidate drugs to improve the observed EMT and phagocytic defects.
We will use novel in vivo assays using a tandem-tagged autophagy reporter mouse model to systematically
elucidate the role of Chol synthesis in retinal phagolysosomal biology. The results obtained will significantly
advance both our fundamental understanding of Chol homeostasis in the vertebrate retina and mechanisms
underlying retinal pathology associated with Chol synthesis defects, and provide new tractable model systems
for future testing of more effective therapeutic interventions for SLOS and related orphan diseases."
10783762,"Project Summary
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major
contributor to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. We propose a 4-year renewal of the Longitudinal
Investigation of Thromboembolism Etiology (LITE), a prospective study of VTE over 3+ decades in the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). In the previous
five project periods, we successfully identified or clarified, in 127 publications, multiple genetic and non-genetic
risk factors for VTE. We plan to build upon these findings, by adding VTE cases, addressing new hypotheses
related to VTE proteomic risk markers, and using information from all project periods to improve understanding
of VTE occurrence and possible prevention.
 LITE's 3 renewal aims are to: Aim 1: Extend VTE event follow-up in ARIC for 4 more years, increasing the
total number of LITE VTE events by 140, to a total of 1,224. Aim 2: Leverage a large panel of aptamer-based,
plasma proteomics data (n~5,000 human proteins) available in ARIC to conduct a prospective study of
proteomic risk markers for incident non-cancer VTE (n=552 cases among 11,600 individuals), and add
identical proteomics data from the HUNT3 Study (n=200 incident non-cancer VTEs and 200 random sub-
cohort). We anticipate also being able to add identical proteomics data on 5,000 CHS participants who
developed 150 VTEs. We will independently replicate significant proteins in the MESA study (n=175 non-
cancer VTE cases among 6,500 participants) and an independent portion of HUNT3 (n=500 additional non-
cancer VTE cases and subcohort n=500). We will validate the top 5 novel, replicated, aptameric-based
proteins by either commercial assays or, where non-existent, by developing targeted quantitative protein
assays using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Aim 3: Conduct a GWAS in ARIC of the novel
proteins identified and replicated in Aim 2, and to replicate any significant genetic associations in MESA and
HUNT3. We will also conduct a Mendelian randomization study to elucidate the causal relation between
significant protein biomarkers and VTE, followed by a network analysis to integrate the genomic and proteomic
findings.
 LITE is one of the few and most productive US prospective studies on VTE. A 4-year renewal will offer
unprecedented opportunities to address several significant NHLBI strategic research priorities by relating
~5,000 aptamer-based protein markers to VTE risk in multiple cohorts. We expect to identify undiscovered
and potentially causal pathways leading to VTE, with the aim of providing critical new knowledge about VTE
etiology, methods to identify people at risk of unprovoked VTE, and potential paths to new interventions for the
prevention and treatment of VTE."
10778574,"While targeted therapy increases overall survival rates in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, most patients
will experience recurrence due to resistance to initially successful therapy (trastuzumab-based). Accordingly,
there is an unmet, patient-driven need to understand and circumvent breast cancer resistance, to even
targeted therapies. At the cellular level, cell-to-cell variation (heterogeneity) is a hallmark of cancer. Perhaps
surprisingly, molecular heterogeneity is also a hallmark of HER2+ breast cancer. Spanning the outer
membrane of a cancer cell, the large protein HER2 displays an extracellular domain, which is the target of
‘targeted therapies’ (vs. chemo- or radiation therapies). These HER2+ breast cancer targeted therapies include
the landmark drug Herceptin® (trastuzumab). But the HER2 protein manifests as a family of proteins (called
protein isoforms), not just a single molecular form. Regrettably, numerous of these HER2 isoforms lack the
extracellular domain of the full-length HER2 protein, making the cell non-responsive otherwise powerful anti-
HER2 targeted therapies. These smaller HER2 isoforms are known as ‘truncated isoforms’, with a 95 kDa form
‘P95HER2’ being especially potent in drug resistance. Until our previous R01 research, the ability to discern
full-length HER2 from the truncated P95HER2 isoform was not readily possible with same-cell resolution.
Consequently, to advance our knowledge of resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapies, we propose to build
on our team’s capacity to precisely distinguish P95HER2 from other HER2 protein forms to scrutinize the role
of P95HER2 in: (1) the potent, signal-activating HER2 dimers that reside on the surface of each breast cancer
cell and (2) potentially ultra-resistant breast cancer cell subpopulations that exhibit both the P95HER2 protein
isoform and the resistance-driving DNA mutation (PIK3CA). These are two cellular ‘modes’ (P95HER2
homo/heterodimers; co-expression of P95HER2 and PIK3CA mutation) that no other tools can directly and with
high-specificity concurrently measure in minute tissue samples, down to single-cell resolution. Our clinical,
biostatistics, and bioengineering team will conduct research to yield tools that can perform these isoform-
involved multimodal assays in tissues and cells from HER2-positive breast cancer patient biopsies (Stanford
Breast Tissue Bank), after performing early development on well-characterized breast cancer cell lines. The
ability to directly measure the truncated HER2 isoforms and interaction modes in sparingly available breast
biopsy tissues and with single-cell resolution should yield a tremendous advantage for understanding and then
assessing the potential for drug resistance. These studies will allow us to profile the cellular and molecular
heterogeneity of HER2 to advance understanding of persistent breast cancer resistance to anti-HER2
targeted treatment and, ultimately, to identify approaches to reduce or eliminate recurrence."
10793635,"Endothelial antigen presentation to T cells as a pathogenic mechanism in influenza-induced acute lung
injury.
ABSTRACT
Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of acute respiratory failure with
substantial mortality, characterized by massive loss of lung vascular barrier function due to excessive
inflammation, endothelial cell injury and death. Up to 20% of hospitalized patients with an influenza infection
develop ALI or ARDS and require mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, there are no targeted therapies available
to prevent death secondary to ALI/ARDS. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms by which
the influenza virus induces ALI and identify novel therapeutic targets. Lung epithelial injury has been well studied
in influenza infections, however the mechanisms of endothelial injury induced by influenza virus are still poorly
understood despite the fact that endothelial injury is a central feature of ALI/ARDS. Besides their role in
maintaining vascular barrier function, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) play an important role in regulating
inflammation. Our novel supporting data indicate that lung ECs consist of at least two major subpopulations –
pro-inflammatory ECs and pro-regenerative or developmental ECs during baseline conditions. Developmental
lung EC express the developmental transcription factor Sox17 which regenerates the injured endothelium during
infections. Inflammatory lung ECs, on the other hand, express low levels of Sox17 and instead express higher
levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. H1N1 infection significantly
upregulates the expression of MHC class I and II molecules in ECs. The infection also significantly increases the
number of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the lung. Therefore, we hypothesize that inflammatory ECs act as
antigen presenting cells and present antigens to T lymphocytes and thus promote acute lung injury. We will study
whether expression of developmental and regenerative transcription factor Sox17 prevents the activation of
inflammatory signaling and antigen presentation. We will also assess whether the lung ECs present antigens to
CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes by MHC class I and II molecules during H1N1-induced ALI. Finally, we will study
whether the activation of CD8 cytotoxic T cells induces EC death via the release of Granzyme B and cleavage
of its intracellular target Gasdermin E during H1N1-induced ALI. Here, we propose a novel mechanism of
endothelial cells as antigen presenting cells in influenza-induced ALI/ARDS. Unravelling this mechanism will
provide new insights and identify novel therapeutic targets into virus-induced ALI."
10812335,"Advent Therapeutics (Advent) is a biotech focusing on novel approaches to reformulate and optimize delivery
of legacy drugs with proven efficacy to address unmet medical needs of specific underserved and orphan patient
populations. Advent is developing an aerosol formulation of its proprietary, optimized water miscible vitamin A
(vitA) palmitate for non-invasive (inhaled) delivery to preterm infants to address vitA deficiency (VAD), and
prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), its most serious and costly complication. Prevention of BPD is the
focus of this Phase IIB/SMA application and a NHLBI topic of specific interest under this FOA, RFA-HL-23-008.
We will be building on the very significant data supported by our Phase I/II SBIR award with our innovative
inhaled vitA formulation that: 1) avoids the drawbacks of invasive intramuscular (IM) injections and absorption
limitations of current oral forms, overcoming significant hurdles for routine NICU utilization, and 2) provides direct-
to-target-organ delivery for increased efficacy- our in vivo data show significant benefit over IM dosing in
mitigating hyperoxic lung damage (in our BPD animal model), while providing adequate systemic delivery to also
treat VAD as discussed in the Research Strategy and in our recent publication (47).
 In collaboration with Dr. Virender Rehan at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, we have completed all Phase I
Specific Aims and are wrapping up Phase II Aims, demonstrating that inhaled vitA: 1) stimulates lung maturation
(assay of lung biomarkers showing upregulation of retinol receptors, surfactant protein and phospholipid
synthesis, as well as maturation biomarkers, while simultaneously raising serum vitA levels similar to IM dosing);
2) dramatically (vs IM) reduces hyperoxic lung tissue damage (assessment of lung tissue histomorphometry and
reduction of lung-injury biomarkers); and 3) preserves pulmonary function (preliminary longer-term PFT data).
 In Phase IIB, we will further refine inhaled vitA dosing strategies for mitigating hyperoxic lung damage (BPD
prevention) in a step-wise approach by studying the well characterized premature lamb BPD model and proceed
with IND-enabling activities to be ready to begin first-in-man clinical studies in preterm infants at risk for
development of BPD. Phase IIb Specific Aims are: 1: Optimization of the dosing regimen of aerosolized vitA
for mitigating hyperoxic lung damage in a premature lamb BPD model, focusing on both the “neonatal” (acute
phase) timeframe, and also over the longer term (chronic phase) into “adulthood”, assessing similar biomarkers,
morphologic, and PFT evaluation as per Phase I/II. Aim 2: proceeding with drug manufacturing development
and scale-up of our formulation under stringent GLP and GMP controls. Aim 3: conducting GLP toxicology
studies in both small (rat) and large (dog) species to support clinic-readiness. Measures of success will be
generation of data supporting further development of our novel non-invasive therapy for preventing BPD (and
treating VAD), including a vitA formulation that meets adequate CMC requirements to proceed into the clinic,
and completion of GLP toxicology showing adequate safety for first-in-man studies in at-risk preterm neonates."
10894125,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer driven by a small
population of self-renewing, highly tumorigenic cells termed GBM stem cells (GSCs). Our long-term goal is to
find improved therapeutics for GBM by better understanding the biology that drives this disease. GBM tumors
have a complex microenvironment including a relatively proliferative perivascular niche containing GSCs
enriched for the stem cell marker SOX2+, and a distinct hypoxic niche that regulates resident GSCs through
hypoxic signaling factors. Because the cells within distinct GBM tumor regions are remarkably different from
each other, we believe that individual tumor microenvironments must be targeted with unique niche-specific
therapies. However, current culture models fail to replicate the complex microenvironments of GSCs, limiting our
ability to study and therapeutically target GBM. We therefore developed patient-derived GBM organoids, a
controlled ex-vivo system that contains both proliferative and hypoxic niches, as well as gradients of stem and
non-stem cells similar to those observed in patient tumors. We developed methods to 3-dimensionally label the
separate niches of organoid cultures and used these techniques to perform the first spatially-resolved functional
screen in any solid tumor. Our results pinpointed the epigenetic effector protein WDR5 as being uniquely
essential to GSCs growing in the proliferative niche of GBM organoids. The objective of this application is to
illuminate the roles of WDR5 in glioblastoma and determine whether disruption of WDR5 activity may have
therapeutic efficacy. To achieve this, we will test the central hypothesis that GSCs require WDR5 to maintain
bivalent gene expression within proliferative tumor niches, and that WDR5 can be targeted to
compromise GBM growth in vivo. We will test this through execution of the following specific Aims: 1)
determine if WDR5 activity is required for niche-specific GSC growth in vivo, 2) determine if WDR5 creates
embryonic stem-cell-like bivalent gene regulation in GBM, and 3) determine if targeting of WDR5 function yields
a therapeutic benefit in GBM preclinical models. The proposed research is an innovative first-of-its-kind study
that will verify the feasibility and efficacy of niche-specific targeted screening and drug identification. This
represents a significant advancement by using novel methodology and feasible new approaches to overcome
an experimental barrier across many cancer types. This conceptual and experimental framework can be applied
to a wide range of cancers, can unmask unique microenvironmental biology, and can allow rationally designed
combination therapies against niche-specific targets. The expected outcome of this work is an understanding of
the roles of WDR5 in GBM niche biology and evaluation of a novel blood-brain-barrier penetrant WDR5 inhibitor
in orthotopic brain tumors. There is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies that significantly
improve the survival of GBM patients. This proposal will investigate the mechanistic role of WDR5 in GBM
biology, while simultaneously testing a promising potential therapeutic in highly accurate preclinical models."
10839937,"Project Summary/Abstract
Respiratory motor control deficit is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with spinal cord
injury. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a rehabilitation strategy for respiration in patients with
spinal cord injury as a standard of care. Our previous findings demonstrate that respiratory function in patients
with chronic spinal cord injury can be improved by using our original inspiratory-expiratory pressure threshold
respiratory training protocol. However, the effectiveness of this intervention is limited by the levels of functional
capacity preserved below the neurological level of injury. Our preliminary data obtained for this proposal
demonstrate that electrical spinal cord stimulation applied epidurally at the lumbar level in combination with
respiratory can activate and re-organize spinal motor networks for respiration. We propose to investigate
respiratory motor control-related responses to epidural spinal cord stimulation alone and in combination with
respiratory training. By characterization of respiratory muscle activation patterns using surface
electromyography in association with pulmonary functional and related cardiovascular measures, we expect to
determine specific stimulation parameters needed to increase spinal excitability below level of injury to
enhance responses to the input from supraspinal centers that remain after injury and to promote the neural
plasticity driven by the respiratory training. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Evaluate the acute effects of epidural spinal cord stimulation on respiratory functional and motor control
properties; and 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of epidural spinal cord stimulation combined with respiratory
training."
10769753,"Age is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the occurrence of this disease is
also affected by environmental factors, individual experience and genetic pre-deposition. Genetic factors are
well established to play an important role in risk of AD. CELF2, an RNA binding protein that regulates
alternative splicing and RNA stability, has been recently identified as a risk factor associated with AD.
Polymorphisms in CELF2 are significantly associated with high-risk alleles of APOE, and the “A” allele of SNP
rs2242451 is associated with reduced AD risk. CELF2 is highly expressed in the nervous system, and
enhanced neuronal CELF2 expression levels have been found in various neurodegeneration models and
human patients. We generated a conditional knockout mouse Celf2 allele. Our preliminary data suggest that
deleting Celf2 in adult brain has beneficial effects, including improved learning and memory. We identified
mRNA targets of mouse CELF2 (using CLIP-seq; cross-linking immunoprecipitation high-throughput
sequencing) and found that CELF2 binds to introns around the alternatively spliced exons of a set of AD-
regulated genes, including APP, MAPT (Tau), PSEN1, PSEN2, and BIN1, suggesting a key role of CELF2 in
regulating alternative splicing of AD-related genes. Alternative splicing of these AD-related genes is known to
regulate AD pathogenesis. For example, alternative splicing of exon 10 of the tau mRNA gives rise to protein
isoforms with three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule binding repeats. Imbalances in 4R: 3R ratio alone have been
reported sufficient to induce the pathogenesis of AD in a human-Tau mouse model. Taken together with the
genetic association between CELF2 SNP and reduced AD risk in humans, we hypothesize that CELF2
expression is up-regulated in AD brains and loss of CELF2 in adult brains is sufficient to rescue AD-related
phenotypes. In Specific Aim 1, we will test whether loss of CELF2 can suppress AD-related phenotypes in C.
elegans AD models. In Specific Aim 2, we will test whether loss of CELF2 in the adult brain is protective
through regulating alternative splicing using AD mouse models. In Specific Aim 3, we will test whether CELF2
expression is increased in AD brains using postmortem human samples and ask if the AD risk-reducing SNP
down regulates CELF2 expression or inhibits its function using human iPSC-derived neurons. We have
obtained postmortem brain samples and established a strong research team with expertise in genetics,
genomics, postmortem AD brains and iPSC. Data from the proposed work will provide important mechanistic
insights that go well beyond published human genetic analyses and ultimately yield new therapeutic targets for
the treatment of AD."
10762479,"ABSTRACT
Acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a serious threat to the survival and function of
transplanted organs. The current options for AMR prevention and treatment are limited by the incomplete
understanding of the mechanisms underlying donor specific alloantibody (DSA) generation and pathogenic
functions. Whereas the production of high affinity isotype-switched DSA is typically associated with germinal
center formation by follicular B cells, the contribution of marginal zone (MZ) B cells to anti-donor responses
following transplantation has not been previously addressed. Our preliminary studies identify MZ B cells as
important players in orchestrating DSA responses and warrant detailed investigation of this B cell subset with an
ultimate objective of reducing humoral alloimmunity in transplant recipients.
Prolonged cold ischemia storage (CIS) of donor allografts and ensuing ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) remain
among leading risk factors for poor transplant outcome. Using a mouse model of kidney transplantation in which
allografts are subjected to 6 h CIS, we found that posttransplant inflammation specifically augments generation
of class II-reactive DSA that mediate allograft glomerular injury. These findings are highly relevant to clinical
studies revealing correlations between longer cold ischemia time, anti-class II DSA and late AMR in renal
transplant patients. However, the mechanisms by which posttransplant inflammation affects generation of
pathogenic class II DSA and the very source of donor class II antigens for B cell activation are poorly defined.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IRI amplifies class II DSA production through the following
steps: 1) IRI up-regulates MHC class II expression on donor endothelial cells (EC) and EC release of class II
containing extracellular vesicles (EEVs); 2) spleen MZ B cells rapidly acquire circulating EEVs, produce early
DSA and facilitate further DSA production by FO B cells; and, 3) in addition to donor alloantigens, MZ B cell
activation is initiated and enhanced by DAMPs carried by graft-derived EVs as well as by systemic effects of IRI.
Therefore, targeting MZ B cell trafficking, activation and functions will inhibit generation of pathogenic class II
DSA and improve outcome of renal allografts subjected to prolonged CIS. We will test this hypothesis in three
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To test whether ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) augments class II DSA by enhancing endothelial
extracellular vesicles (EEV) generation. Aim 2. To test the role of MZ B cells in DSA production following renal
transplantation. Aim 3. To investigate the contribution of MZ B cells in the generation of pathogenic class II DSA
after prolonged cold ischemia storage of renal allografts.
The proposed studies will fill several gaps in current knowledge of humoral alloimmune responses to
vascularized organ transplants and identify potential targets of therapeutic intervention to inhibit antibody-
mediated rejection."
10995438,"Abstract
 The focus of research in my lab is to determine how physiological functions of Slo2 channels are
regulated by other proteins. Slo2 channels are a family of large-conductance potassium channels existing
in mammals as well as invertebrates. Human and mouse each have two such channels: Slo2.1/Slick and
Slo2.2/Slack, whereas the nematode C. elegans has only one, SLO-2. These channels are widely expressed
in the nervous system, and play important roles in shaping neuronal firing properties. Mutations of Slack
in humans often cause epilepsies and intellectual disability. Although physiological functions of Slo2
channels are expected to be dependent on many other regulatory proteins, molecular identities and their
mechanisms of action are only beginning to be recognized. In the past few years, we identified several
proteins required for SLO-2 physiological functions in C. elegans, including two RNA/DNA binding
proteins (HRPU-2 and a SAFB-like transcription modulator tentatively named SLTM-1), one RNA editing
modulator (ADR-1), one protein tyrosine phosphatase (tentatively named PTP-5), and one pseudokinase
(SCYL-1), which all have mammalian homologs. Our results suggest that HRPU-2 and SLTM-1 regulate
SLO-2 function through controlling the expression of PTP-5, whereas ADR-1 regulates SLO-2 function
through enhancing the expression of SCYL-1. We have demonstrated that SCYL-1 increases SLO-2
activity through direct interactions, and this regulation is conserved between mammalian SCYL1 and Slack.
In the next five years, our major goals are to determine how PTP-5 regulates SLO-2 function and whether
the regulatory mechanism is conserved with human Slo2 and a human PTP-5 homolog, to determine how
HRPU-2 and SLTM-1 regulate PTP-5 expression, and to identify putative proteins required for ADR-1-
dependent SCYL-1 expression using a forward genetics approach. We envision that results from the
proposed studies will not only provide important new knowledge about the regulation of worm SLO-2, but
also have the potential to reveal evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of Slo2 channel regulation."

Pneumonia, including both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated

Systems Biology Center, Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT), which we rename
Super-SCRIPT (SCRIPT2) for this renewal, leverages bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), nasal curettage, and blood
sampling paired with cutting-edge multi-omics technologies—including multiparameter flow cytometry, single-
cell RNA-sequencing, deep pathogen sequencing, DNA metagenomics, and deep clinical phenotyping—to
develop models of pneumonia pathogenesis. In SCRIPT, we generated a detailed systems biology model of
SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology that supported a novel therapy for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia that was
efficacious in a phase II clinical trial. In SCRIPT2, we will determine whether models generated using high-
dimension longitudinal data describing the host response, pathogen, microbiome, and clinical phenome in
patients with severe CAP (Project 1) and HAP/VAP (Project 2) can predict favorable or unfavorable clinical
transitions over the course of a pneumonia episode. We test the hypothesis that multi-omics inputs will
create actionable models that identify favorable and unfavorable clinical transitions/outcomes for both
severe CAP and severe HAP/VAP.
Aim 1/Project 1. To generate actionable models to improve the clinical course of patients with severe
CAP using multi-omics analysis of longitudinal samples from the distal lung and nasopharynx.
Aim 2/Project 2. To generate actionable models to improve the clinical course of patients with severe
HAP/VAP using a multi-omics analysis of longitudinal samples from the distal lung.
Three scientific cores support the projects. The Technology Core developed cutting edge multi-omics
approaches for the analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples collected as part of clinical care. The Data
Management and Bioinformatics Core weaves together clinical data extracted from our own EHR and those from
other centers. The Modeling Core works seamlessly with the Projects and Cores to integrate, validate and
iteratively improve latent space models of disease. Clinician scholars who provide direct care to patients with
pneumonia lead or contribute to each project and core, enhancing the translational impact of our findings."
10757320,"Project Summary/Abstract – Administrative Core
This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to further delineate the complex host/pathogen
interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia.
The SCRIPT2 Systems Biology Center is intentionally multidisciplinary, increasing the complexity of interactions
and mandating a centralized approach to facilitate accomplishing the goals of this Systems Biology Center. The
major premise of the SCRIPT2 Systems Biology Center research agenda is an iterative approach to
host/pathogen interactions based on results of high throughput omics approaches and mathematical modeling
of the results. We therefore expect that prior results will drive subsequent experiments. Integration and facilitation
of these subsequent experiments between the different Cores and investigators will be the primary responsibility
of the Administrative Core. The Administrative Core will also ensure that data generated by the Projects and Cores
are disseminated in formats that are useful to the larger community of pneumonia and infectious diseases
researchers. The Administrative Core will accomplish these objectives in four specific aims:
Aim 1. To support communication between Project Investigators, Core Leaders, other U19 Systems
Biology Center Investigators, and NIAID Program Staff. The Administrative Core will be responsible for
coordinating communication across the entire range of Center activities, including internal relationships with the
multidisciplinary SCRIPT2 investigators, with other U19 Centers, and with NIH/NIAID program staff.
Aim 2. To provide a structure for the distribution of common resources and the dissemination of
information, as well as regulatory oversight and budgetary and personnel resource management, to the
Project Investigators and Core Leaders. We expect that prior modeling results will drive subsequent analyses
or data/sample collection. Integration and facilitation of these subsequent analyses between the different Cores
and investigators will be the primary responsibility of the Administrative Core.
Aim 3. To disseminate the discoveries made by Project Investigators through publications,
presentations, and the sharing of materials and raw data to other institutions and investigators, including
via NIAID-directed public databases/repositories. We are committed to making our data Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).
Aim 4. To foster a local and external environment of collaborative interdisciplinary research and
mentoring of trainees to promote a systems biology approach to pneumonia, other infectious diseases,
and other critical illnesses. We believe that the SCRIPT2 Systems Biology multi-omics and mathematical
modeling approach to severe pneumonia is pertinent to other infections and other critical illnesses. The Admin
Core will organize a suite of local and outreach activities to foster this approach."
10763781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bidirectional transport of vesicles and organelles in cells involves a tug-of-war between the microtubule motors
kinesin and dynein. This transport is particularly important in the axons and dendrites of neurons and in cilia and
flagella, and transport defects are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and ALS, as well
as ciliopathies. Although many of the molecular players are known, the working mechanisms of these component
parts and how their activities combine to achieve the emergent property of bidirectional transport are not
sufficiently understood. The goal of this proposal is to bridge the gulf in understanding between the
mechanochemistry of single kinesin and dynein motors and the bidirectional transport dynamics of vesicles and
organelles observed in cells. Unresolved questions include: How does load affect the mechanochemistry and
detachment kinetics of different kinesins and dynein? How do opposing motors coordinate and compete to
achieve bidirectional transport? How do regulatory proteins, microtubule associated proteins and tubulin post-
translational modifications alter the balance of plus- and minus-end directed motility to achieve proper vectorial
transport? To address these questions, Interferometric Scattering (iSCAT) microscopy with nanometer spatial
precision and millisecond temporal resolution will be used to track individual motor domains, single motor
proteins, and multi-motor assemblies as they step along their microtubule tracks. These microscopy studies will
be complemented by stopped-flow kinetics investigations, in vitro reconstitution experiments, and computational
modeling to understand assemblies of increasing complexity. Specific motor mechanisms to be investigated
include the origin of the fast speed and superprocessivity of kinesin-3, the polymerase mechanism of kinesin-5,
and the molecular basis of dynein activation by its adapter proteins. A DNA tensiometer will be developed to
understand the influence of mechanical load on kinesin and dynein mechanochemistry, and statistical tools will
be developed to extract load-dependent detachment kinetics from these experiments. Finally, multi-motor
assemblies will be built using DNA origami, which allows for precise control of motor number and positioning,
and reconstituted lipid vesicles, which mimic the mechanical and diffusional properties of intracellular cargo. This
work will advance our understanding of how organelles are correctly positioned in cells and how specific
intracellular cargo are reliably targeted to their proper cellular locations."
10767793,"Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the veteran population.
In the United States, there are an estimated 5.3 million people living with a TBI-related disability. TBI
commonly leads to neurocognitive deficits, however, other systemic effects have also been associated with
TBI. Cardiovascular effects include stress-related cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, ECG repolarization changes,
and increased cardiac reactive oxygen species. These effects may be mediated by catecholamine surges,
although the mechanism(s) are unclear. In a clinical study of TBI in US veterans, TBI was strongly associated
with the severity of coronary artery calcification as measured by electron beam computed tomography,
suggesting TBI may promote processes involved in atherogenesis. Importantly, there was a marked
independent association of TBI with cardiovascular mortality with a relative risk of 2.89 compared to a non-TBI
control group, even after adjusting for typical cardiovascular risk factors. These observations indicate there
may be a chronic and potent effect of TBI on atherosclerosis. However, whether these findings represent a
direct link between TBI and systemic vascular changes or represent other confounding factors is unclear. The
goal of this application is to determine the impact of TBI on vascular disease and to uncover underlying
mechanisms responsible for these effects. Based on these results, therapeutic interventions will be tested in
attempts to block the vasculopathic effects of TBI.
Research Plan: To assess the effect of TBI in vascular disease processes, mouse models of TBI will be used
to determine the effects of brain injury on sympathetic activity, vascular function, leukocyte-endothelial
interactions and the development of atherosclerosis. Biomarkers and possible mediators will be measured
through a combination of flow cytometry, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, ELISA’s,
magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analyses. Therapies designed to block activation of candidate
adrenergic and downstream cytokine-triggered inflammatory pathways following TBI will be tested using
relevant vascular endpoints.
Methods: The strategy to accomplish the objectives will be to use in vivo mouse models, ex vivo, and in vitro
assays to explore mediators of inflammation and vascular disease associated with TBI. Aim 1 will determine
the effect of TBI on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and vascular function in atherosclerotic-prone
mice.These endpoints will shed light on mechanisms related to the increased vascular risk associated with TBI.
Aim 2 will explore mechanism(s) by which TBI promotes atherosclerosis by characterizing inflammatory
responses, measuring catecholamines, and testing effects of adrenergic antagonists on vascular endpoints.
Aim 3 will determine the role of downstream mediators, p-selecting glyocoprotein ligand-1, interleukin-1
receptor, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on myeloid activation and atherosclerosis induced by TBI,
as these factors could serve as therapeutic targets."
10767845,"The goal of this resubmitted application is to define signature exhaled breath volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) in veterans exposed to toxicants and to develop an effective portable exhaled
breath health monitoring system for soldiers at risk of developing respiratory disease. This project
will bring a suite of portable sensors forward into use with the aim of supporting large scale
epidemiological studies in military respiratory health. Specifically, our proposal responds to the
call for research on the causes, treatment and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, including identification and validation of biomarkers and disease phenotypes, as well as
employing personalized medicine approaches in clinical research and disease management.
While environmental triggers have long been recognized as key factors in respiratory disease, it
has been challenging to concurrently measure health metrics and environmental exposures and
associate the two. Also, a technology gap has existed for portable monitoring systems that can
perform these functions simultaneously while continuously logging data. Breath testing of exhaled
VOC biomarkers is a new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare for military and
civilian populations in the US. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis
sensor can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate this to ambient
field exposures as well as changes in lung function among exposed soldiers. This will allow
doctors and researchers to define field exposures that have adverse effects on respiratory health,
including worsening of asthma and the development of COPD. In aim #1, we propose to define
VOC biomarkers produced by the lung upon exposure to the toxicants. We have developed a
reliable method to measure the exceptionally small amount of VOCs emitted from well-
differentiated tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells in vitro. We will utilize this system to identify
the signature and cellular source of VOCs emitted from TBEs exposed to toxicants and traffic
related air pollutants. These experiments will be performed in primary cells from the lungs of
humans in order to correlate with in vivo studies. In aim#2, we plan to expand our inventory of
portable breath samplers for the clinical studies. In aim #3, we will perform a short-term, one-
week clinical study in 4 cohorts at the VANCHCS and UC Davis sites to define a signature of
breath biomarkers, including eicosanoids, that correlate with the presence of disease, namely
asthma. A total of 100 veteran and civilian subjects will be enrolled over 4 years. Together, data
from our tools will allow military doctors, researchers and others to more fully understand asthma
and other respiratory diseases in exposed field soldiers in ways that has never been possible
before."
10768573,"Although activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is involved in cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis,
induction in stem-like phenotype, and drug resistance, little is known about its dynamic control and plasticity.
Recent studies have suggested that the functional crosstalk between APC/Wnt/ß-catenin and RAS-ERK
pathways plays an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis. Our initial data
suggest that the MEK/ERK pathway and subsequently Wnt/ß-catenin signaling are activated by STRAP
(Serine Threonine Kinase Receptor Associated Protein) that we cloned several years ago. We have shown
that STRAP is upregulated in more than 70% of CRCs and induces cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, self-
renewal of cancer stem-like cells (CSC), and drug resistance. We have observed that conditional knockout of
Strap in mice decreases the number and size of intestinal tumors induced by genetically inactivated APC (Apc
Min). We showed that STRAP induces CRC metastasis in vivo in a spontaneous metastasis model. In CRC
patients, upregulation of STRAP is associated with worse survival following adjuvant therapy. In contrast,
patients carrying tumors with normal or low STRAP expression benefited from the treatment, suggesting its
potential role in chemoresistance. Interestingly, we showed that reduced expression of STRAP enhances drug
(5-FU and Oxaliplatin)-induced apoptosis and sensitizes cells to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Therefore,
these in vitro and in vivo studies provide the proof-of-concept that abrogating STRAP signaling in CRC will
decrease tumorigenicity and metastasis and will sensitize CRC tumors to chemotherapy. We already have
developed a nanocarrier PMBOx-PMPOy-PMEOz to achieve in vivo codelivery of STRAP siRNA and 5-FU-Oxp-
OA (oleic acid motif). We have observed that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of STRAP siRNA decreases cell
proliferation, migration and invasion. Based on the preliminary information, we have formulated the
hypothesis: Therapeutic targeting of pro-oncogenic functions of STRAP by siRNA-based nanoformulation will
be effective in treating CRC patients as well as sensitizing CRC patients with 5-FU and/or Oxaliplatin based
chemotherapy. The following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine how STRAP activates MEK/ERK
pathway and subsequently Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer. Aim 2: Characterize tumor-promoting
functions of STRAP in vivo and determine its role in the development and progression of spontaneous
intestinal tumors. Aim 3: Develop a novel therapy that is based on siRNA-mediated silencing of STRAP using
nanoparticles (NPs) alone and in combination with codelivery of 5-FU and Oxaliplatin.
 Impact: As 1) STRAP inhibits the tumor suppression function of TGF-ß; 2) it promotes CSC self-
renewal and drug resistance; 3) upregulation of STRAP exerts tumor promoting effects including invasion and
metastasis; 4) its upregulation in CRC patients contributes to worse survival with chemotherapy; 5) it induces
tumorigenicity through inactivated APC signaling, activated Wnt/ß-catenin, and MEK/ERK pathways; and 6) its
knockout in cells and mice have no effect on normal physiological functions; STRAP is a promising and unique
therapeutic target. Therefore, this first attempt of targeting STRAP by improved siRNA-mediated silencing
strategy using a multifunctional nanomicellar carrier alone and in combination with codelivery of 5-FU and
Oxaliplatin will provide strong translational potential to develop pre-therapeutic leads for colon cancer.
Smoking has been shown to have causal effects on colon and rectal cancers in significant percentage of
veteran men and women especially over 50 years of age. Therefore, this innovative and preclinical biomedical
research has the potential for significant advances in healthcare for veterans. This project will include two
priority research areas of specific interest to BLR&D, 1) risky behavior related to smoking and 2) women
veteran's health (RFA# BX-19-001)."
10894615,"HPV infections must persist for years to decades to cause cervical cancer. During this time, the host genome acquires
mutations that promote tumorigenesis. Do HPV oncogenes (HPV E6 and E7) play an active (causing mutations by
disrupting DNA repair) and/or a passive (via degradation of tumor suppressors like p53 and RB) role in the acquisition of
these mutations? While it is established that HPV oncogenes degrade tumor suppressors, there is evidence that they
may also actively promote genome destabilization. During the viral life cycle, HPV E6 and E7 induce a hyperactivation of
DNA damage signaling and recruit repair factors to sites of viral replication. Our group and others have shown that HPV
oncogenes also change how cells repair double stranded breaks in DNA (DSBs). Our published data and data presented
in this proposal provide further details that show that HPV oncogenes shift DSB repair from error free mechanisms
(homologous recombination or HR) to error prone (microhomology-mediated end joining or MMEJ) mechanisms. These
data suggest that HPV E6 and E7 makes DSB repair more mutagenic, but this has yet to be demonstrated. Other
substantial questions also remain. How do HPV oncogenes promote the shift towards repair by MMEJ? Do HPV
oncogenes promote canonical MMEJ or does the switch to MMEJ result after HPV oncogenes block completion of HR? If
HPV makes DSB repair more mutagenic, is the increase universal or does the presence of non-allelic homology (via
repetitive Alu elements) augment HPV-mediated mutagenesis? Similarly, if HPV oncogenes make DSB repair mutagenic
do they contribute equally to the process? Aim 1 will address mechanistic question regarding how HPV oncogenes
promote the use of MMEJ and how the pathway is initiated, using a combination of live and fixed cell microscopy. Aim 2
will define the extent that HPV oncogenes make DSB more mutagenic and the extent that their mutagenic properties are
further enhanced by the presence of Alu elements. Aim 2 will use a novel reporter construct and droplet digital PCR,
along with deep sequencing approaches and novel bioinformatic pipelines to accomplish these goals. These approaches
have been pioneered by our research team. These innovative approaches will facilitate an improved understanding of
the fundamental processes that drive cervical cancer development. Given that cervical cancers are the 4th most common
cancer in women and kill someone every 90 seconds, this information is important. The knowledge gaps addressed in
this proposal are also relevant to understanding why most HPV infections do not result in cervical cancer and for
developing methods to prevent those that do. Finally, given that cervical cancers are often treated with genotoxic
agents (e.g., cisplatin or radiotherapy), understanding how HPV changes DNA repair could lead to the identification of
ways to augment these interventions. For example, if HPV oncogenes promote MMEJ via a delayed entry into the
pathway, small molecule inhibitors of proteins involved in terminal MMEJ steps would likely result in a tumor-specific
enhancement of radiotoxicity."
10814308,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Malignant gliomas, specifically glioblastoma (GBM), are highly aggressive, incurable brain tumors. Even with
maximal surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation, tumor recurrence is absolute and median survival is
approximately 14 months. Immunotherapeutic strategies have had notable success in the management of
multiple solid malignancies. Unfortunately, immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint blockade, has had limited
success in the treatment of GBM due to its immunosuppressive microenvironment and multiple intrinsic immune
evasive mechanisms. Novel strategies to address local immunosuppression, augment the immune response
and enhance responsiveness to immunotherapies are warranted to improve patient outcome. The gut
microbiome is a well-established modulator of host immune responses. Microbiota-driven immunomodulation
has been demonstrated to impact responses to immunotherapy in multiple malignancies and interventions that
modulate the microbiome can enhance treatment response and improve patient outcome. In addition to the gut
microbiome, the intra-tumoral microbiome has also been demonstrated to impact patient response to
immunotherapy. The microbiome-gut-brain-axis is a known bidirectional pathway with extensive
immunomodulatory influence on the central nervous system (CNS) including a direct impact on the functionality
of microglia. Further the gut microbiome has also been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of a
variety of neurological conditions. In addition to the gut microbiome, our own work and others have demonstrated
the presence of bacterial signatures in GBM patient samples, however the clinical impact of the GBM tumor
microbiome is unknown. Despite its pervasive influence, the role of the microbiome in CNS malignancies has
not been evaluated. We propose to address this gap in knowledge with a systematic, multi-platform evaluation
of the microbial composition GBM using prospectively collected clinical samples (tumor and gut/stool). We will
correlate these microbial signatures with both the immune composition of the GBM tumor microenvironment and
patient outcome measures. Further, we will compliment our clinical finding with preclinical, immunocompetent
GBM mouse model examining the impact of gut microbiome depletion on tumor growth and the tumor immune
microenvironment. Our hypothesis is that differential gut and tumor microbial signatures are present in GBM
patients, contribute to the tumor microenvironment composition and impact patient outcome. We will study this
via the following aims: AIM 1: Determine the gut and tumor microbiome signatures associated with improved
outcomes in patients with GBM. AIM 2: Determine the immunomodulatory role of the microbiome in GBM. If
successful, we will be the first to describe the role of the gut and tumor microbiome in malignant glioma. Our
long-term goal is to develop novel strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve patient outcome."
10904635,"Abstract
Inflammasomes are multi-protein signaling scaffolds that form in the cytosol upon stimulation by
pathogen and damage signals to activate caspase-1. Canonical inflammasome sensors are
mainly nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins, such
as NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP6. Once inflammasome is activated, caspase-1 is recruited to the
platform and activated through proximity-induced autoproteolysis. Activated caspase-1 processes
pro-interleukin (IL)-1b, pro-IL-18, and the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), resulting
in the maturation and release of these cytokines, as well as pyroptotic cell death. NLRP6 plays
versatile roles in host defense. It is highly expressed in the intestine and the liver. The
inflammasome function of NLRP6 has been reported to protect the host from pathogen evasion
and injury-induced tissue damage. On the other hand, the excessive NLRP6 inflammasome
activation and the subsequent hyperactive IL-18 signaling may exacerbate the tissue damage
and cause chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whether
there is an intrinsic cellular signal that tunes the activity of NLRP6 inflammasome becomes an
intriguing question. The question is critical to understanding how our body maintains tissue
homeostasis by harnessing this important inflammasome and to provide targeted therapy for
certain diseases.
Nuclear import is an essential cellular process in innate immune defense by translocating
activated transcription factors into the nucleus for interferon production. Plant NLRs themselves
have been reported to enable host defense through pathogen effector-mediated nuclear
translocation. In our preliminary study, we found that importin-b1, a common nuclear import
receptor, inhibits dsRNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of NLRP6 in-vitro, which
implicates the potential link between nuclear import and NLRP6 inflammasome signaling.
In this application, we will investigate the potential role of importins in regulating the NLRP6
inflammasome by tackling two questions: 1) molecular basis of the importin-NLRP6 interaction
(cryo-electron microscopy and biochemistry), and 2) the roles of importin-b1 in negatively
regulating NLRP6 inflammasome upon viral infection (inflammasome cell biology)."
10757425,"Project Abstract
 RNA structure and function are intimately linked. To sort out what the myriad RNAs in transcriptomes are
doing, we need rigorous approaches that also infer structure. Many predictive algorithms already exist, but they
output models for any and every sequence, and different approaches often output different models for the
same sequence. This results in suboptimal models that permeate the field, and in ascribing structure to RNAs
that don't in fact have any conserved structure. What the field of RNA research needs now to go forward is a
computational tool that will evaluate the likelihood that a certain RNA sequence has a biological structure, and
propose that structure with the highest accuracy. The best approach to this issue has been for a long time the
comparison of homologous sequences from diverse organisms. This same approach is actually at the basis of
the most successful protein structure prediction tools. But a hindrance in the wide adoption of such approaches
for predicting RNA structure is that sequence comparison requires knowledge and expertise in computational
and structural biology as well as access to tools that are not mainstream. This proposal is about the
development of a freely available webserver for reliably predicting RNA secondary and eventually tertiary
structures using evolutionary information. This webserver will operate behind the scenes as a suite of tools (the
outputs of which will be available for interested users), from homologous sequences retrieval to evaluation of
the resulting model. First, this tool will automatically retrieve and align homologous sequences using
existing and novel algorithms. This aim will search for relevant homologs to any single sequence entered as
input, which represents an unmet challenge for most current programs. Second, the application using
covariation analysis will address the likeliness that the input RNA sequence has a conserved structure,
so not every sequence used as input will necessarily output a structure model. Subsequent modules in
the online tool will evaluate the quality of the alignment, and possibly improve this alignment, so that a model
with a confidence score could be proposed. Regardless of the outcome, the user will have a result that will take
into account evolutionary as well as up-to-date RNA structural information, so it will not be biased by the use of
a single set of parameters, as is often the case with existing predictive methods. A more holistic and
straightforward computational tool harnessing evolutionary information will help disseminate the use of those
methods to the larger RNA biology community, for maximum impact on experimental design in RNA research."
10784727,"Project Summary
The goal of this research is to inform the development of adolescent health programs through understanding
the development and trajectories of empowerment over the course of adolescence, among girls and boys, and
quantifying how this process influences sexual and reproductive health behaviors and outcomes. The
proposed project will use four waves of longitudinal data, collected annually from a sample of 2,842
adolescents, aged 10-14 years at enrollment, in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Learnings from this
research will inform interventions designed to improve empowerment and affect long-term health trajectories of
adolescents as they transition into adulthood.
The specific aims are:
 1. Establish how agency evolves over time for boys and girls. Using each sub-scale of agency
 (Freedom of Movement, Voice, Decision-Making) and a combined agency score across all domains, we
 will conduct latent growth curve modeling to assess how individual scores change over time and
 explore how these trajectories differ by gender.
 2. Identify significant socio-ecological factors (opportunity structures) that influence trajectories,
 by gender. We will use latent growth curve modeling to explore the effect of time varying socio-
 ecological factors (including individual, family, peer, and neighborhood factors) that predict changes in
 total agency and within each agency sub-scale to assess how opportunity structures influence the
 development of agency over time.
 3. Assess the association of agency in very young adolescence with sexual and reproductive
 health behaviors in later adolescence. We will use Cox Proportional Hazard models to assess the
 relationship of each domain of agency with age at sexual debut and logistic regression to evaluate
 contraceptive behavior, and volitional sex, assessing the effect of both baseline levels of agency and
 change over time in its impact on sexual and reproductive health behaviors.
The study is a secondary data analysis of longitudinal data from the Global Early Adolescent Study. Aims 1
and 2 will employ stratified latent growth curve models to explore how three previously validated measures of
agency change over time and by gender. Aim 3 will employ Cox Proportional Hazards models and
multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the relationship between empowerment and key sexual
and reproductive health behaviors and outcomes."
10755248,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprises a group of early-onset neurodegenerative diseases characterized by
widespread neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system leading to impairment of behavior, language
and cognition. As for other forms of dementias, mechanisms of neurodegeneration are only poorly understood
and curative treatment options still do not exist. There is growing evidence that non-cell-autonomous
mechanisms play an important role during disease development and that microglial cells significantly contribute
to pathologic changes in patients' brains. Microglial cells are strongly activated in the brains of patients with FTD
and their activation appears to be highest in areas of neuronal cell death. Also, imaging studies have
demonstrated that microglial activation begins early during disease development. Thus, it is very likely that
microglia directly contribute to neuronal degeneration in FTD, a role that has surprisingly been understudied in
the field. This K08 career development project sets out to elucidate such microglia-mediated, non-cell-
autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration by combining molecular analyses including single-nucleus RNA
sequencing in postmortem brain tissue with a dynamic human stem cell model of FTD using patient-derived
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The overall goal of this study is to characterize changes in cellular
programs in neurons and microglia in FTD and to understand if and how patient microglia influence the integrity
of adjacent neurons in this disease. Encouraged by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the neurotrophin
receptor p75NTR plays has an important role in this context by promoting death of neurons at risk. We also
propose that FTD-patient derived neurons carry an increased susceptibility to cell death that is further aggravated
by glia cells. This study will apply co-culture assays on iPSC-derived FTD and gene-corrected control neurons
in vitro (Specific Aim 1), transplantation of these cells into the brains of immunocompromised mice (Specific Aim
2) and single cell studies on postmortem brain tissue from FTD patients (Specific Aim 3). During the K08 Award
period, the applicant will also receive training in single-nucleus RNA sequencing on human cells and tissues
from patients with FTD. This project will advance our understanding of the role of microglia and neurotrophin
signaling in the pathogenesis of FTD with the long-term goal to better understand and potentially therapeutically
address the underlying mechanisms of this disease."
10810638,"Interventions promoting physical activity among cancer survivors improve their functioning, reduce fatigue and
offer other benefits in cancer recovery and risk reduction for future cancer. There is a need for interventions
that can be implemented on a wider-scale than in research settings. Our 12-week theory-based exercise
intervention that was delivered by research staff by telephone was efficacious in improving fitness, and
increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among breast, colorectal and endometrial cancer
survivors. To widen the intervention’s reach, we trained peer coaches in the American Cancer Society’s Reach
to Recovery program to deliver the same MVPA intervention called Moving Forward Together (MFT) to other
breast cancer survivors. In a randomized controlled trial, MFT significantly increased MVPA and provided
psychosocial benefits for these survivors (Pinto, Stein & Dunsiger, 2015). Now, our goal is to prepare for wider
implementation of MFT by automating key resource-intensive components such as matching survivors with
a coach by using a web-based peer mentoring platform and to collect key indices to prepare for large scale
implementation. InquistHealth’s web platform (Mentor1to1™) has demonstrated to be effective in peer
mentoring for chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes). We will partner with InquisitHealth to adapt their
web platform for MFT. The aim is to streamline intervention delivery, assure fidelity and improve survivor
outcomes. There will be two phases in this 4-year R01 application: in Phase 1, we will work with 6 peer
coaches who have already delivered MFT (our original evidence-based MVPA intervention) in prior work.
Using iterative user-centered design principles, we will modify the web platform for MFT, creating webMFT. In
Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which 10-12 peer coaches will deliver webMFT to 56
breast cancer survivors who will be randomized to receive either webMFT or MVPA Tracking. We will recruit
and train coaches naïve to MFT from three cancer care organizations with peer mentoring programs. We will
collect feasibility and acceptability data about webMFT from the coaches. We will examine survivor outcomes
(objectively measured MVPA and self-reported fatigue, quality of life, physical functioning and mood) by using
mixed effects regression models to compare groups at 12 weeks. We will obtain survivors’ feedback on their
experience with webMFT. Based on the RE-AIM framework and PRISM, we will collect data on
implementation indices at the organizational level by conducting key multi-level stakeholder interviews.
Using newer technologies for enhanced intervention delivery, program management and automated data
collection has the exciting promise of facilitating effective implementation by organizations with limited
resources. Adapting evidence-based MFT to a customized web platform and collecting data at multiple-levels
(coaches, survivors and organizations) along with costs will provide a strong foundation for a robust multi-site
implementation trial to increase MVPA (and its benefits) among many more breast cancer survivors."
10778570,"Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a high-affinity receptor for factor (F)VII and
FVIIa. The TF-FVIIa complex is the primary initiator of coagulation and plays an essential role in hemostasis.
However, aberrant TF expression underlies most forms of thrombosis. TF expression is also induced in response
to bacterial and viral infections as part of the innate immune response. This expression can be either protective
by limiting the spread of the pathogen or pathologic by triggering disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
TF-dependent generation of coagulation proteases also leads to activation of protease-activated receptors
(PARs). My lab has made major contributions to understanding the roles of TF, coagulation proteases and PARs
in hemostasis, thrombosis, endotoxemia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and viral infections. This
R35 OIA application is an extension of two NHLBI funded R01 grants: Mechanism of venous thrombosis in
pancreatic cancer; Role of the thrombin PAR1 pathway in viral infection. We have shown that levels of circulating
tumor-derived, TF+ extracellular vesicles (EVs) are associated with increased venous thromboembolism in
pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, we found that TF+ EVs enhance venous thrombosis in mice bearing
human pancreatic tumors. We have also shown that TF-dependent activation of coagulation and PAR1 signaling
is protective in response to Coxsackievirus B3 by boosting the antiviral IFNβ pathway in the heart. In contrast,
PAR1 suppresses the pathologic NF-κB response in the lung in response to influenza A H1N1 infection. The OIA
funding mechanism would provide stable funding and increased time for our group to pursue higher risk-higher
reward projects, such as performing proteomic analysis of plasma and EVs, establish new technologies, such
as the ExoView system, and following up on exciting discoveries. Our long-term goals are to further
understand the protective and pathologic roles of TF, coagulation proteases and PARs in cancer and
infections. There are two hypotheses for this proposal: 1/ TF enhances venous thrombosis and tumor growth
in pancreatic cancer, and 2/ TF-dependent activation of coagulation is both protective and pathologic in response
to viral infection. We will continue our studies on the identification of plasma biomarkers of thrombotic risk in
cancer patients using clinical samples. We will identify prothrombotic pathways that contribute to cancer-
associated thrombosis using mouse models. In addition, we will determine the roles of tumor and host derived
TF in the growth of pancreatic tumors in mice. We will identify the cellular sources of pathologic TF in mouse
models of viral infection that may lead to new treatments to prevent DIC. We will elucidate how PAR1 is protective
by both enhancing the IFNβ antiviral pathway in the heart and suppressing the pathologic NF-κB pathway in the
lung in response to viral infection. This knowledge may lead to the identification of new biomarkers of thrombotic
risk, treatments for pancreatic cancer and protection from viral infection."
10763789,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer immunotherapy with T-cells expressing a transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR) can generate sustained
clinical responses in a variety of malignancies. However, many patients do not respond, or eventually relapse.
The goals of this proposal are to classify how progressive epigenomic and transcriptomic changes experienced
by clinical transgenic TCR T-cells over time are associated with a gradual loss of function of these therapies,
and how these changes correlate with clinical response or non-response to therapy.
The proposed research focuses on the comparison of the epigenomic, transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional
characteristics of baseline transgenic TCR T-cells with samples recovered at later timepoints, utilizing a large
cohort of clinical samples from patients treated with these cell therapeutics. In doing so, the candidate will
address three main research aims: 1) Relate the epigenomic/transcriptomic changes experienced by transgenic
T-cells over time, and their T-cell-specific in silico ontological/functional associations, with clinical response to
therapy; 2) Define the transgenic T-cells’ progressive changes in phenotypic and cytokine secretion functionality
profiles associated with clinical response or non-response to therapy; and 3) Determine the impact of epigenetic
silencing on suppression of the expression of the transgenic TCR itself over time. The practical implications of
this work include the enabling of highly detailed epigenomic profiling of a given patient’s transgenic T-cell
therapeutics to help guide clinical decision-making, as well as provide novel targets for genetic engineering of
newer generations of transgenic cellular therapies.
The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational cellular immunotherapy research, and is strongly
supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his department/division at the University of
California, Los Angeles. He currently holds a position as a Clinical Instructor in the Department of Pediatrics,
Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, with 80% protected time for research. The current proposal builds
on the candidate’s previous research and clinical experience by including a comprehensive mentorship and
didactic plan to advance the candidate’s skills and knowledge in epigenomics and computational biology required
for developing expertise in this area of focus. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Antoni Ribas, and
his Scientific Advisory Committee members Dr. Theodore Moore, Dr. Matteo Pellegrini, and Dr. Yvonne Chen,
he will advance his bioinformatics skills, while learning epigenomic, T-cell phenotype profiling, and cytokinetic
functionality methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive
training and research plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a
successful independent investigator specializing in cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, with a
focus on the cells’ epigenomic changes over time and their correlates with clinical response to therapy."
10821375,"Project Summary
There is a growing appreciation for the importance of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in both normal human
development and disease. The dynamic regulation of chromatin architecture is a frequently studied and central
epigenetic process. Mutations in chromatin-associated proteins have been linked to neurological disorders such
as intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy, a variety of developmental syndromes, and detected in
approximately 50% of human cancers, many of which are recognized as driver mutations across multiple diverse
tumors. Nevertheless, many of the assays used to study chromatin biology remain cumbersome, expensive, or
lack experimental robustness, problems which have resulted in large gaps in our understanding of this critical
biological mechanism. Therefore, innovative new technologies that enable efficient and reproducible
interrogation of epigenetic mechanisms are badly needed.
We have invented a unique cavitation enhancement reagent that dramatically decreases the time and acoustic
energy required for genomic DNA fragmentation in a sonication device. This proposal aims to expand the
application of our cavitation enhancement technology to address the scientifically relevant challenge of extracting
high quality chromatin from archival tissues. Lengthy formaldehyde fixation (FF) followed by dehydration and
paraffin embedding (PE) is the standard method of archiving tissue samples. These FFPE tissue collections
contain a wealth of information on human disease. However, extraction of chromatin from these specimens has
proven virtually impossible because of the challenge of preserving relevant DNA-protein interactions. Preliminary
data suggest that our cavitation enhancement reagent has the potential to simplify and standardize chromatin
extraction from archived tissues, thereby greatly expanding the range of applications for FFPE-derived chromatin
in epigenetic-based biomedical research."
10806159,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our
understanding of macroscopic functional brain networks. However, inherent constraints of current fMRI
methodologies in humans limit our ability to probe the mechanisms underlying these networks. The
overarching goal of this project is to shed light on cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying the
functional organization of the default-mode network (DMN) – a large-scale brain network that is crucial
for a wide range of behaviors. While the new technologies in rodents allows us to experimentally reveal
causal control of DMN, rodent DMN topology has only been defined using resting-state fMRI, but not
functionally in terms of activation or suppression of brain activity in response to behaviorally relevant
salient stimuli. This represents a critical barrier preventing any straightforward translation between
rodent and human DMN research findings. To address this, we developed a novel silent zero-echo-
time (ZTE) fMRI technique, enabling awake rodent imaging and the use of an auditory oddball
paradigm, wherein deviant oddball stimuli presented amongst a sequence of repetitive control stimuli
can drive attention and suppress DMN. We also developed an MR-compatible, four-channel,
spectrally-resolved fiber-photometry system, allowing concurrent recording of ground-truth neuronal
activities during fMRI. To shed light on the circuit mechanisms governing the DMN, we proposed
two complementary research Aims building on our rigorous prior research. In Aim 1, we will determine
how attention to salient stimuli alters DMN activity and connectivity using the novel ZTE-photometry
platform. In Aim 2, we will introduce time-locked optogenetics on defined cell types to causally
manipulate the activity of anterior insula – the brain region assumed to be responsible for DMN dynamic
switching in numerous fMRI causal modeling studies. Functionally dissecting the rodent DMN
architecture is critical to the understanding of DMN transition mechanisms, which will enable us to
causally model, and make predictions about brain states, bringing insight into the network basis of
human behavior and neuropsychiatric/neurological disorders.

10786041,"Project Summary/Abstract
Microbial communities inhabit nearly all environments on earth, including the human body, where they can
influence health in myriad ways. These communities are often composed of hundreds or more species that form
networks of metabolic interactions. Because metabolic interactions are complex and difficult to study at a
molecular level, my research program focuses on interactions involving one family of metabolites – corrinoid
cofactors – as a model to understand metabolic interactions among bacteria. Corrinoids are the vitamin B12 family
of cobalt-containing metabolites that are used as enzyme cofactors for a variety of reactions. Corrinoids, like
many amino acids, nucleobases, and other cofactors, are synthesized by only a fraction of bacteria that use
them, and therefore are considered to be shared metabolites. Corrinoids are unique in their structural diversity,
with over a dozen different forms discovered and up to eight of these forms found in microbial community
samples, including the human gut. This structural diversity is a significant factor in microbial interactions because
most bacteria are selective in the corrinoids they can use. The hypothesis driving this work is that structurally
distinct corrinoids can be used as handles to manipulate microbial communities. Our previous NIGMS-funded
research has laid the groundwork for the proposed research by establishing experimental methods; discovering
and characterizing new genes; investigating corrinoid selectivity in enzymes, riboswitches, and bacteria; and
creating a bioinformatic pipeline to predict corrinoid metabolism in bacteria. Our long-term vision is to build on
this foundation to generate a newly detailed understanding of microbial community interactions through the study
of corrinoids across scales, from molecular mechanisms to whole community perturbations. We will achieve this
goal by (1) identifying genome sequence signatures predictive of bacterial corrinoid preferences in corrinoid-
dependent enzymes and riboswitches, with an emphasis on evolutionary approaches and (2) investigating the
molecular basis of corrinoid-dependent community dynamics by applying sequencing, culture-dependent, and
genetic approaches to a model human gut-derived enrichment culture. As a test of our ability to understand and
predict corrinoid-based metabolism and community dynamics, we will design and build bacterial strains with
corrinoid-dependent metabolic networks, as well as consortia of bacteria with predictable dynamics. This
research will be accomplished by using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, microbiology, and
bioinformatics, building upon the past research of my group. Our work on corrinoids will not only serve as a
model for microbial community interactions across systems, but may also lead to the development of new
methods to alter microbial communities for beneficial outcomes."
10791846,"Trachoma, caused by ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection, is the leading infectious cause of blindness
worldwide and been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2030. As we approach the
endgame, there is broad interest in the use of serologic surveys to support control programs. IgG antibody
responses to C. trachomatis in children enable accurate population-level assessments of trachoma endemicity
because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. After years of assay development,
a key gap in the field is to formalize the epidemiologic methods used for trachoma serology surveys.
Our overall objective is to advance the methods used for the design and analysis of trachoma serology
surveys. We will assemble a large, contemporary global dataset for trachoma serology across a gradient of
endemicity, paired with clinical signs and molecular measures of infection (>100,000 blood specimens tested in
19 studies from 2010-2024). Aim 1 will develop robust methods to translate antibody response into population-
level measures of transmission from endemic settings to post-elimination. We hypothesize that as populations
approach elimination age-seroprevalence curves will flatten and seroconversion rates, a measure of force of
infection, will approach zero. We will estimate age-seroprevalence curves semi-parametrically, and derive
summary measures from the curves (e.g., seroprevalence, force of infection). We will compare serologic
measures between populations of different endemicity. We further hypothesize that different serologic
summary measures (mean IgG levels, seroprevalence, force of infection) will provide similar information about
heterogeneity in transmission. We will compare serologic measures with one-another and with separate
measures of trachoma (PCR infection, clinical signs) across geographic scales from villages to districts. Aim 2
will determine if model-based geostatistics improve the efficiency of serological survey design and enable finer
scale targeting of control programs as populations approach elimination. We hypothesize that as trachoma
approaches elimination, it will become more focal with “hotspots” of elevated seroprevalence among children
that shrink in scale from districts down to individual villages. We hypothesize that if surveys account for this
spatial structure in their design they will more efficiently monitor trachoma than random samples alone, and
control programs that use spatial predictions to make treatment decisions at smaller spatial scales could more
narrowly target antibiotic distribution. In analyses of 11 georeferenced studies that span a range of endemicity,
we will apply recent advances in geospatial design to trachoma serology and compare prevalence estimates
using the new approach with the current standard, population-based random samples. We seek to identify the
most efficient sampling strategies to inform decision making as populations approach elimination, and to study
the impact of using spatial predictions to target azithromycin at finer spatial scales. Completion of these aims
will lead to significant advances in the seroepidemiologic methods used to support the trachoma endgame."
10819496,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and is incurable,
invariably recuring after standard therapy with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. GBM cell heterogeneity
allows it to thrive in varying adverse conditions in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including therapeutic
insults, hypoxic stress, and immune attack. Interactions with cells in the TME—including neurons, glia,
endothelium, and immune cells—support this heterogeneity and plasticity, contributing to the tumorigenicity,
resistance, and recurrence of this deadly disease. Given the limited efficacy of standard treatment approaches
in GBM, there is an urgent need to decipher and therapeutically target protumorigenic interactions in the TME.
There is evidence that glioma cells form an interconnected network that facilitates the exchange of mitochondria,
which are the main energy-producing organelle and regulate metabolism, proliferation, and epigenetics. There
is also early evidence that mitochondria can be transferred from non-malignant cells to cancer cells. However,
there is limited understanding of mitochondrial transfer dynamics from the TME to GBM; the
mechanisms that govern this transfer; and the downstream effects of transfer on recipient GBM cells.
Addressing this knowledge gap is vital for designing therapeutics that target this interaction. I hypothesize that
mitochondria are transferred from neural cells in the TME to GBM by the action of fusogenic proteins, and that
this transfer drives tumorigenicity by metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Specific Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that astrocytes are the predominant mitochondrial donors, and that transfer is mediated by fusogenic
proteins termed syncytins. I will investigate mitochondrial donor identity using transgenic mice and cell models
expressing lineage-specific mitochondrial fluorophores. I will test how knockdown and overexpression of
syncytins affects rate and protumorigenic effects of transfer from astrocytes to GBM cells. Specific Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes drives GBM proliferation and tumorigenicity by
metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. I will investigate how transfer of ATP-synthase with mitochondria
drives tumorigenicity; how mitochondrial transfer results in plasticity of GBM heterogeneity by global metabolic
reprogramming; and how mitochondrial transfer drives proliferation by epigenetic reprogramming and increased
chromatin accessibility. Career development and long-term objectives: I will receive training in cancer
metabolism and brain tumor research, and interact with a mentorship committee of experts from both fields. This
training and the proposed studies are invaluable for my career goal of establishing an independent research
program with the following long-term objectives: (a) elucidate molecular mechanisms of how mitochondrial
transfer reprograms metabolism and epigenetics, (b) develop therapeutics targeting mitochondrial transfer and
its downstream effects, (c) investigate how metabolic interactions in the TME impact other treatment modalities,
including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in GBM and other cancers."
10746457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Notwithstanding decades of work on the mechanisms and applications of transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS), the translation of tDCS to a broadly-used and meaningful therapy is halted. We propose that this is a
result of three factors that will be addressed in this proposal. First, the intensity of stimulation has remained
limited; Second, there is a lack of clarity as to whether stimulation should be paired with a specific behavioral
task; and third, there is a lack of consensus on the underlying mechanisms of action. We have shown in vitro
that electric field stimulation can polarize neurons in proportion to the applied field, which interacts with
concurrent induction of synaptic plasticity, and is thus functionally specific. In light of this, tDCS should inherit
the specificity of concurrent behavioral training and effects should scale with intensity. This hypothesis will be
tested here in parallel human and rat experiments in the context of motor learning. Aim 1 is to test the
prediction that stimulation has to be concurrent to behavioral motor learning, and effects scale with intensity
and reverse with polarity. In humans we will test this with a newly-developed electrode montage that achieves
the highest field-intensities on the motor cortex to-date, resulting in strong effect sizes for motor sequence
learning. For rats, we will use a new stimulation protocol with strong effects on learning in a pellet-reaching
task. Aim 2 is to test the prediction, in humans and rats, that effects are specific to the stimulated motor cortex
and, in humans, that effects are specific to the trained task. Outcome measures will be motor learning and
motor cortex excitability (motor-evoked potentials). Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis in rats that behavioral
benefits of tDCS are associated with spatially specific functional and structural changes in the motor cortex
(measured with 2D motor map and synaptic markers), and causally depends on modulation of motor cortex
activity (controlled with chemogenetic inactivation). The outcomes of these experiments, regardless of whether
they confirm or refute the basic hypothesis, will directly address the factors that are limiting progress. By
emphasizing rigor this project will yield robust go-to experiments that can serve as standard tools for future
exploration. By focusing on motor learning, the work is immediately applicable to motor rehabilitation."
10761756,"Urethral stricture disease (USD) in males can result from trauma such as blast or straddle injuries, infection,
inflammation, or iatrogenic/idiopathic etiologies. USD produces voiding and storage-related urinary
complications, which can damage the bladder and then ultimately impair renal function. In Veterans, a total of
92,448 procedures were performed for USD in 5 years. Of the transurethral and open surgical interventions, a
majority of Veterans (>95%) undergo non-surgical transurethral interventions for USD. These non-surgical
interventions are not often permanently successful. Thus, the currently used non-surgical interventions are not
only ineffective but also known to complicate surgical interventional outcomes. The analysis of urethral
scar tissue has shown increased fibrosis of the urethral epithelium and surrounding corpus spongiosum. Our
preliminary studies confirm these findings and further demonstrate that repeated transurethral interventions
such as transurethral dilation (TUD) increased scarring. As seen in urethral scar tissues from stricture
patients, scarring is mediated by upregulation of the fibrogenic network.
We hypothesize (i) urinary microbiomes may play a role by altering mucosal permeability and (ii) that increased
fibrosis after injury. A clear understanding of these molecular mechanisms involved in urethral fibrosis would
enable identification of novel targets for development of innovative strategies in order to eventually prevent/treat
this disorder. The specific aims of our studies are to determine: 1) mechanisms of increased tissue damage
after repeated transurethral interventions; 2) the role of microbiomes and 3) causality using in vitro co-culture
studies. We will use several novel approaches: 1) longitudinal measurement of stricture development in
Veterans using non-invasive imaging; 2) detailed analytical studies in urine/scar tissues from stricture patients
to identify cellular and molecular pathways. These evaluations will also include the role of microbiomes; 3) We
will isolate bacteria from clean catch urine specimens and perform co-culture experiments using human
urothelial cell culture (HUCC) model. The proposed studies will help to (i) identify the microbiomes that have
the ability to adhere to and invade urethral mucosal cells (urothelium), induce fibrosis or cell (mucosal)
damage and (ii) also to a test a mucosal barrier protection strategy. Mechanistic insights gained from these
studies will not only examine the topic from the molecular level, but also unravel novel targets for further
development of treatment strategies to prevent fibrosis. Thus, our proposal is both conceptually novel (role of
microbiomes) and innovative (uses novel approaches, interventions, and tools such as MR-UTE to study
fibrosis), paving the way for new therapies. This study has high potential for clinical translation (application of
novel diagnostic tools and development of anti-fibrotic interventions) to maximize functional recovery in the
aging Veteran population."
10837882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Opioid use in the United States has been at epidemic proportions for many years. Concerted efforts across
the spectrum of political, social awareness, clinical and research initiatives have so far been unable to curb the
rising rates of opioid use and opioid overdose deaths across the USA. From the treatment standpoint, a number
of novel therapies to alleviate the severe opioid withdrawal symptoms and/or reduce risk of relapse continue to
be proposed. A significant portion of research into potential therapies focuses on testing FDA-approved drugs
as potential treatments for opioid use. Such approach relies on the verified scientific rationale and clinically
validated drug targets to ensure that these studies will produce efficacious new drugs for opioid use disorder.
 One of such drugs is memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, that has shown encouraging results as an
adjunct to existing opioid use therapies. Therapeutics effects of memantine are due to the involvement of
glutamatergic pathways in the development and maintenance of opioid addiction, and its clinical tolerability likely
derives from preferential inhibition of NMDA receptors located outside the synapse, since broad spectrum NMDA
receptor antagonists are associated with serious clinical side effects. However, memantine concentrations must
be kept low to take advantage of its preferential antagonism, because at higher (and more therapeutically
relevant) concentrations, memantine may inhibit synaptic NMDA receptors and trigger side effects.
 To resolve this problem, NeurANO Bioscience created a nanoparticle-based (AuM) conjugate comprising
several memantine molecules. Due to its dimensions, AuM cannot access the synaptic cleft and synaptic NMDA
receptors, but allows activation of extrasynaptic NMDAR receptors with the potency greatly exceeding that of
free memantine. During Phase I studies, we discovered that AuM can drastically minimize the opioid withdrawal
symptoms, and demonstrated that AuM can be delivered into the brain at therapeutic concentrations using
intranasal administration. During proposed Phase II studies, we will proceed with efforts directed at establishing
the commercial manufacturability of AuM, determining optimal administration routes and AuM dosage for the
treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and exploring AuM therapeutic potential for the prevention of
acquisition of opioid dependence and/or relapse. Using the data acquired during Phase II studies, we will
develop the efficient strategy to pursue IND-enabling studies for use of exclusive antagonists of extrasynaptic
NMDARs in the treatment of OUD."
10766207,"In 2020, more than 38.5 million (10.5%) U.S. households were without reliable access to sufficient quantities of
affordable, nutritious food due to limited money or other resources. Food insecurity, poor nutrition, and economic
disadvantage are critical social determinants of health that contribute to disparities in type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), a serious diet-sensitive chronic disease affecting more than 20% of food insecure adults. Coping
strategies favor inexpensive, ultra-processed foods that substantially diminish diet quality and are associated
with increased incidence and severity of T2DM, including poorer glycemic control and excess body weight. Given
that numerous social factors and systems contribute to and perpetuate food insecurity and poor diabetes
outcomes, there is a demonstrable need for multilevel (individual, household, community) food-focused
interventions to effectively and sustainably address the diet quality of persons with, or at risk of, T2DM. To our
knowledge, no studies have rigorously tested whether intervention programs explicitly designed to improve both
food and nutrition security of low-income persons with T2DM are feasibly delivered by personnel at a Federally
Qualified Health Center (FQHC), acceptable to patients seeking care in their medical home, or are capable of
producing clinically relevant changes in T2DM endpoints. These are questions we will explore in our proposed
randomized wait-list controlled pilot study— Food and Resources Expanded to Support Health and Type
2 Diabetes (FRESH-T2DM)— in which our previously developed food and diabetes self-management education
(DSME) intervention (FRESH) will be delivered to 50 adult FQHC patients with T2DM and food insecurity
twice monthly, for 6 months. The FRESH intervention consists of bimonthly food provision; a series of recipes
that feature FRESH foods; diabetes self-management education (DSME) resources; and four, 30-minute visits
with an FQHC Registered Dietitian Nutritionist and Certified Diabetes Educator who will help participants utilize
FRESH resources to meet personalized treatment goals. We will build upon our prior work and existing
collaborations with colleagues at El Rio Community Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center serving
>110,000 underinsured, uninsured patients and the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona, a regional
food bank serving 180,000 Arizonans across 5 counties to: (Specific Aim 1) Assess the feasibility, acceptability,
and participant uptake of our FRESH intervention, delivered to 50 food insecure adults with T2DM at their medical
home, El Rio Community Health Center, and (Specific Aim 2) Explore changes in blood glucose control, diet
quality, food security, diabetes self-care behaviors, and health-related quality of life among participants at 3 and
6 months. Completion of our pilot study —submitted in response to NIDDK PAS-20-160 —will produce data to
inform the rationale and design of a future definitive randomized controlled clinical trial, including recruitment,
retention, adherence, and cost data. Our long-term goal is to produce a tested, efficacious model of coordinated
care capable of replication and scaling across other FQHCs and food bank networks."
10831015,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol misuse is rising in females. As females may experience worse health consequences then males and
female-specific risks associated with alcohol misuse, elucidating female-specific factors is essential to build a
better understanding of alcohol misuse in females and the development of prevention strategies for alcohol
misuse in females. A small literature implicates dimensional premenstrual dysphoric disorder (dPMDD)—a
mood disorder characterized by clinically significant emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms during the
late luteal that completely resolve by the mid follicular—as a critical female-specific risk factor for alcohol
misuse and luteal phase increases in alcohol use. However, no studies to date have evaluated the shared
physiological and emotional pathways of dPMDD and alcohol misuse. Emotion regulation encompasses the
awareness and identification of emotion, and strategies to modify the emotional response. Emotion regulation
may also be physiologically represented. Heart rate variability (HRV), an index of parasympathetic control over
heartrate, is considered a peripheral psychophysiological marker of emotion regulation. Reduced subjective
and objective (i.e., HRV) emotion regulation has been shown to associate with alcohol misuse. However,
studies have not investigated how cyclical changes in emotion regulation may act as a risk factor for alcohol
misuse and whether this differs between females with compared to without dPMDD. HRV shows the lowest
levels during the luteal phase and our pilot data shows greater luteal phase reductions in HRV map onto more
significant increases in luteal phase negative emotion. Our central hypothesis is that females with dPMDD
suffer from recurrent luteal phase increases in heavy drinking due to progesterone-related declines in HRV and
associated deficits in emotion regulation. The proposed study will recruit premenopausal females with heavy
alcohol use (50% dPMDD) who will complete 4 weeks of prospective screening; and 5 weeks of Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA) and HRV assessment. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that dPMDD will show larger
luteal phase increases in alcohol misuse relative to no dPMDD. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that cyclical deficits
in emotion regulation will predict cyclical increases in alcohol misuse. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that individual
differences in the degree of HRV reduction from the follicular to the luteal phase will predict greater luteal
phase increases in alcohol variables. The results of this study will importantly contribute to the NIH strategic
plan for research addressing sex/gender differences and female health. Specifically, this study will provide
information on cyclical emotion regulation associations with alcohol misuse, which will provide foundational
information regarding the influence of emotion regulation in the context of heavy drinking and the etiologic
overlap between female alcohol misuse and emotion regulation in dPMDD."
10772017,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer screening is an essential cancer control strategy for several cancer types, including colorectal, cervical,
and lung cancer screening. However, cancer screening utilization rates are suboptimal and disparities by race
and ethnicity persist. Observed disparities in cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening by race and ethnicity
likely contribute to the persistent and historic disparities in survival for these cancers. Prior research and
theoretical models indicate that multilevel (e.g., patient-, provider-, healthcare system-level) cancer screening
initiatives are the most effective for improving outcomes and understanding modifiable drivers of disparities.
However, such initiatives have been difficult to implement given the paucity of research on healthcare system-
level factors, including how factors at the healthcare system-level intersect with those at the other levels.
Improving utilization of cancer screening is critical to achieve population-level mortality reduction, but care must
be taken to tailor interventions to underserved populations in order to ensure that existing disparities are
narrowed, rather than widened. The objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the
synergistic effects of patient-, provider-, and healthcare system-level factors on cancer screening rates, and how
these multilevel factors modify racial and ethnic disparities. My specific aims are: 1) Assess cervical, colorectal,
and lung cancer screening rates by healthcare system-level factors (e.g., screening policies and programs), and
compare the magnitude of any observed disparities by race and ethnicity across different healthcare system-
level factors (K99), 2) Characterize patient and provider perspectives on multilevel factors throughout the lung
screening process using qualitative interviewing and thematic analysis (K99), and 3) Elucidate provider-level
drivers of cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening and employ a multilevel approach to examine
associations with cancer screening rates, including interactions with race and ethnicity (R00). To achieve these
aims, data from the National Cancer Institute’s Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process
(PROSPR II) consortium will be leveraged, which is unique, rich data comprised of a racially and ethnically
diverse population receiving care at community healthcare systems across the US. The results of this analysis
will provide evidence for the identification of potential targets for a multilevel intervention to improve screening
utilization and narrow disparities. In addition to this research, Dr. Del Vecchio’s comprehensive career
development plan includes structured mentorship from leaders in cancer screening research and additional
training in qualitative and mixed methods research, healthcare delivery research, health disparities research,
implementation science, and multilevel analysis. Throughout this award, Dr. Del Vecchio will acquire the
knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent
investigator studying factors contributing to suboptimal care throughout the cancer control continuum and
developing multilevel interventions to improve healthcare delivery and cancer outcomes."
10775807,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rising rate of antibiotic resistance is increasingly complicating treatment for infections that, not long ago,
were easily treated. Prominent among these are catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs),
which are the most common hospital-associated infection (HAI), and infections of ureteral stents. Over 15
million UTIs occur in the USA each year with accompanying deterioration in the quality of life and increased
health care costs. As a result, 15% of all antibiotics prescribed are for the treatment of UTIs, making these
infections a leading cause of antibiotic use. Complicating treatment decisions for CAUTI/stent-related infections
is that most of these infections are polymicrobial, with multiple bacterial species simultaneously colonizing the
implant. Current treatment guidelines typically focus on a single infecting organism and do not consider the
underlying polymicrobial foundation of the infection, as reflected by the fact that treatment is often ineffective,
requires the removal and replacement with a new catheter/stent, which typically then becomes infected by the
same consortia of bacterial species. There is a significant gap in knowledge of the specific composition of
these consortia, including fastidious species not amenable to detection by traditional approaches. Other
knowledge gaps include: i) the mechanisms that promote and sustain these polymicrobial infections; ii) which
communities/members are responsible for symptoms; iii) why certain consortia show resilience and reappear
even in the presence of antibiotic treatment; and iv) development of antibiotic and antibiotic-sparing strategies
that efficiently disrupt the cycle of polymicrobial infection on urinary catheters and stents. To address this
problem, experimental murine CAUTI models have been developed for several prominent Gram-negative and
Gram-positive uropathogens, including important multi-drug resistant (MDR) genera such as Enterococcus,
Staphylococcus, Klebsiella and Acinetobacter and cutting-edge small molecule therapeutics and
immunotherapies have been developed that are highly effective in murine monomicrobial CAUTI models. This
proposal will build upon this foundation to: i) characterize human samples from patients with long-term
indwelling catheters or stents using a third-generation metagenomic sequencing approach to determine (in <7
hours from sample collection) all members of the infecting consortia and their antibiotic resistance profiles; as
proof of concept same day diagnosis and antibiotic prescription in the clinical setting; ii) correlate measures of
UTI symptomatology and disease outcomes with specific community members; iii) use mouse and in vitro
biofilm models to investigate mechanisms of bacterial-bacterial interactions critical in catheter-associated
polymicrobial communities; and iv) investigate the ability of therapeutics, known to be efficacious against one
species, to treat polymicrobial CAUTIs. These studies will provide important insights into; i) polymicrobial
communities found in the clinic; ii) mechanisms by which polymicrobial communities persist; and iii)
development of new treatment strategies."
10751019,"Most women in the USA who have dense breasts at screening mammography receive a letter notifying them
that mammography is less effective for them and having dense breasts increases the risk of breast cancer.
The letter advises women to talk with their physician whether they should have additional screening with
ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The possible benefit of additional screening is detecting a
mammographically occult (MO) cancer. However, the likelihood that a woman has a missed cancer is not
known. Thus, women are left with a difficult decision, balancing the uncertain potential benefit of additional
screening against the known costs. These known costs are financial (as some states do not cover the
supplemental screen) and the risk of an unnecessary biopsy, as the specificity of ultrasound and MRI are lower
than mammography. We have developed a novel technique using a Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform
(RCDT) to detect MO cancers. The RCDT can highlight subtle suspicious signals by detecting asymmetries
between the left and right mammograms. Our technique achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.81 using
screening mammograms. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), a pseudo-3D imaging technique, is replacing
mammography in the USA, because of its higher sensitivity and specificity. However, MO cancers still exist in
DBT. The goal of our research is to develop imaging biomarkers for MO cancers on screening DBT of women
with dense breasts. This would allow women to know the likelihood that they have an MO cancer and, thereby,
allow them to make a more informed choice regarding supplemental screening. The key difference between
DBT and standard 2D mammography is the available information in the z-direction. Such additional information
provides advantages for cancer detection, but it also adds technical complexity when applying RCDT on DBT
images. There are three ways to process DBT exams for RCDT: 1) applying RCDT on 2D DBT slices, 2)
applying RCDT on synthetic mammograms from DBT, and 3) applying the 3D RCDT on DBT volumes. To
develop imaging biomarkers for MO cancer in screening DBT, we need to investigate the optimal method to
process DBT for RCDT. We will develop imaging biomarkers for the three methods using a developmental
dataset of 900 MO cancer cases (clinical cases read as normal, but the woman has breast cancer detected on
her next screening DBT) and 1800 cases (clinical cases read as normal and the woman does not have breast
cancer detected on her next two screening DBTs). We will utilize a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) and
a 3D CNN as robust classifiers to analyze the RCDT processed DBT for MO cancer detection. Using a 5-fold
cross-validation, we will train CNNs for each method and find the optimal method to process DBT for MO
cancer detection. Finally, we will use an independent dataset of 100 cases to validate the classifier. If we are
successful, then up to 15 million women each year who have dense breasts will have needed information upon
which to base their decision for getting supplemental screening."
10805413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Unfortunately, women have increased coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality risk after menopause. This
can be partially attributed to increases in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors that many women experience
after menopause, such as blood pressure, lipid levels, and adiposity, but the mechanisms behind these and
other changes are poorly understood. A reduction in circulating estrogen levels is one of the major changes with
menopause, and estrogen can transcriptionally regulate many genes, often in a tissue-specific manner. Prior
studies of changes in gene expression with menopause have been limited, and most have been focused on
breast, bone, and female reproductive tissues. We hypothesize that transcriptomic examination of
cardiometabolic tissues across the menopause transition will reveal insight into the molecular processes
responsible for the increased CVD risk. Though menopause status information is missing from most human
tissue gene expression datasets, we hypothesize that menopausal status can be inferred from gene expression
data. To accomplish this, in Aim 1A we will infer the menopausal status of hundreds of female Genotype-Tisssue
Expression (GTEx) subjects based on the gene expression profiles of their female reproductive tissues, using a
combination of dimensionality reduction approaches informed by known biology and more agnostic, clustering-
based methodology. Since the average GTEx subject contributed samples from over 18 tissues, we will have
inferred menopausal status information for non-reproductive tissues as well. In a preliminary analysis of uterus
gene expression data (withholding age as a covariate), we observed clear classification of individuals into an
inferred premenopausal and an inferred postmenopausal group. In Aim 1B, we will use the inferred menopausal
status information from Aim 1A to identify genes and pathways that are differentially expressed in tissues derived
from inferred premenopausal versus postmenopausal women, focusing on cardiometabolic tissues of relevance
to cardiovascular disease, such as liver, adipose, and blood vessels. Finally, since menopause status is
confounded by age, in Aim 2 we will identify sex-specific aging genes in cardiometabolic GTEx tissues and other
existing human tissue gene expression datasets with age and sex information from suitable numbers of younger
(age<50) and older (age >50) adults and examine the relationship of gene expression with chronological age in
each sex subset. Inferred menopause-related genes that do not exhibit similar correlations with chronological
age in male tissues are likely to be regulated by the female-specific hormonal changes during menopause rather
than more general aging processes. Overall, this will be the most comprehensive evaluation of the effects of
menopause on gene expression performed to date, and the findings could identify molecular pathways
underlying the increased disease burden in post-menopausal women."
10770549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome that substantially elevates lifetime risks for
multiple cancers in both men and women. Identifying people with LS enables more frequent and earlier cancer
surveillance and prevention, which can effectively reduce LS-related cancer morbidity and mortality. However,
most people with LS in the United States are not diagnosed. One cost-effective way to identify individuals with
LS is by conducting genetic testing on blood relatives of patients diagnosed with LS (or “cascade testing”), but
the testing rate is low. Pre-test genetic counseling is a promising means to address many of the barriers to testing
and to increase testing uptake. However, pre-test genetic counseling uptake is low in relatives at risk of LS, and
the barriers and facilitators have not been systematically studied. Although informational resources for LS genetic
counseling exist, they are unlikely to be sufficient for motivating behavior change. Aligned with the National
Cancer Institute’s focus on cancer research to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer,
healthier lives, the proposed research will address these critical gaps through three aims: 1) Identify barriers and
facilitators to pre-test genetic counseling among relatives with no personal history of cancer but at risk of LS; 2)
Develop a theory-based behavioral intervention to increase pre-test genetic counseling uptake in this population;
and 3) Evaluate and optimize feasibility of the trial methods and the behavioral intervention to prepare for a fully
powered randomized controlled trial and explore the intervention’s preliminary efficacy. I will apply the Behavior
Change Wheel, a well-established behavior change framework, and use mixed methods (i.e., focus groups,
usability testing, and a randomized controlled pilot trial) to develop a behavioral intervention to increase pre-test
genetic counseling uptake. The proposed research will lead to an R01 proposal to test the efficacy of the
intervention. My study team consists of outstanding mentors who have recognized expertise in the
methodologies and topic areas of the proposed research, and a genetic counselor who will ensure that the
research is clinically grounded. In coordination with my research activities, my career development plan includes
structured training and one-on-one mentoring in behavioral medicine and intervention design and development,
design and conduct of clinical trials, qualitative methods, and grant writing and management. Along with the
abundant research and training resources and the supportive environment for transitioning early-career

10808934,"ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most commonly occurring cardiac arrhythmia. It is associated with a lower
quality of life and a higher rate of morbidity and mortality primarily due to poor hemodynamic performance and
often stroke. One of the primary options to treat AF is cardiac ablation where the physician applies radiofrequency
energy via percutaneous catheters to form a series of lesions that directly destroys or isolates abnormal sources
of electrical activity. Specific to AF ablation, a series of lesions are created to encircle the pulmonary veins
forming an electrical barrier that isolates the arrhythmogenic foci inside the vein from the rest of the heart.
However, while attempting to form lesion sets, the physician inadvertently leaves viable gaps that can be
extremely difficult to detect, especially when the tissue is electrically stunned but remains metabolically viable.
When this happens, these gaps will heal over time and reconduct the abnormal electrical activity to the rest of
the heart, causing high post-procedural recurrence rates. As such, there is a strong clinical need to identify these
gaps. Unfortunately, to date there are limited means for real-time monitoring of tissue injury and gap detection
during ablation procedures and there are no means of directly detecting permanently damaged cardiac tissue.
Here we propose to commercialize a new generation of percutaneous catheters that can distinguish viable from
ablated cardiac tissue by sensing, in real time, spectral changes in tissue autofluorescence profiles caused by
thermal damage. During the Phase II we produced and tested in live animals two versions of catheters, one that
acquires an optical signature from a single fiber at the point where catheter tip touches the tissue, and a more
complex version capable of hyperspectral imaging. This Phase IIB proposal seeks NIH funding to help
commercialize the first optically enabled therapeutic ablation catheters under the trade name OmniView™. The
first major task of the proposal to do so will be to manufacture 270 catheters and 20 instruments to be used for
V&V testing and the subsequent clinical trial. These catheters and the instruments will undergo extensive V&V
safety testing based upon standards outlined in the proposal. GLP live animal testing will be conducted in the
large-animal porcine model. Following successful V&V testing, we will prepare an Investigational Device
Exemption document set for submission to the FDA in order to receive permission to begin the clinical trial. We
have identified five hospital sites with highly regarded electrophysiologists who are eager to participate. We have
also held initial meetings with the FDA to obtain feedback on clinical strategy and have identified a CRO for
clinical trial oversight. We will then perform the clinical trial as the key step towards commercialization. In
summary, there remains an unmet clinical need for a system that can distinguish, in real-time, healthy versus
ablated myocardial tissue with high resolution in order to identify and ablate gaps between lesions. Our new
generation of percutaneous catheters and instruments is capable of acquiring tissue autofluorescence profiles
during the ablation procedure therefore assisting physicians in providing better care."
10756989,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal requests funding for continuation and extension of a phase IIa clinical trial of rifampin, an FDA-
approved antibiotic, for safety and efficacy as a treatment for idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH) due to
mutations in the gene encoding CYP24A1 gene. IIH is an uncommon metabolic condition characterized by
elevated plasma levels of the activated form of vitamin D, calcitriol, and consequently increased intestinal
absorption of calcium and increased bone resorption that together cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.
Although IIH typically presents in infancy, patients manifest a life-long defect in vitamin D metabolism that results
in hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and renal insufficiency. CYP24A1 encodes the 24-hydroxylase enzyme that
represents the principal pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites, and biallelic mutations cause the most
common and severe form of IIH. Loss of this pathway allows plasma levels of calcitriol to rise excessively and
overcomes feedback mechanisms that should downregulate production of calcitriol. Patients who carry only one
defective CYP24A1 allele have a less severe phenotype. There is at present no specific long-term treatment for
patients with CYP24A1 mutations and conventional care consists of minimizing sunlight exposure, a low calcium
diet, and avoidance of vitamin D-rich foods and vitamin D supplements. This approach does not reduce the risk
of renal calcification and renal insufficiency, however, and may lead to low bone density. Thus, there is a
significant unmet medical need for safe and effective treatments for this disorder. We have compelling data
supporting a therapeutic approach in which the antibiotic rifampin is repurposed to induce expression of CYP3A4,
an enzyme that is expressed in the liver and intestine, to provide an alternative pathway for inactivation of vitamin
D metabolites. The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel strategies for medical treatment of patients
with IIH and other forms of hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis that are associated with elevated plasma levels of
calcitriol. The objective in this application is to determine the optimal safe and effective dose of rifampin that
normalizes serum and urine levels of calcium and reduces intestinal absorption of calcium (primary outcomes).
Our two complementary goals are to evaluate the extent to which these primary outcomes are related to plasma
levels of rifampin, induction of CYP3A4, polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene and other genes that influence
mineral metabolism, and changes in plasma levels of vitamin D metabolites and to determine the effect of
CYP24A1 mutations on bone health. Our central hypothesis is that induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin will reduce
levels of calcitriol and thereby decrease intestinal absorption of calcium and we expect that benefits will be related
to the extent of CYP3A4 induction. We have access to the necessary study subjects and the expertise and resources
to pursue these studies. Our approach is innovative because it proposes to repurpose a well-characterized and safe
medication to a new role as a primary therapy for a disorder that currently lacks an effective treatment."
10752687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemic heart disease, such as unstable coronary angina or myocardial infarction, often leads to systolic heart
failure due to the loss of contractile cardiomyocytes. Engineered heart tissue mediated transplantation of stem
cell derived cardiomyocytes holds the promise to regenerate the myocardium and improve cardiac function
post myocardial infarction in preclinical animal models. Despite these encouraging results, several critical
barriers limit the clinical application of engineered heart tissue-based therapy. For example, the poor perfusion
in the infarct area compromises the survival of transplanted cardiomyocytes. In addition, the procedure of
transplantation of engineered heart tissue typically requires open chest surgery which is a significant challenge
to the patients with severe heart failure. Data from our previous studies showed that promoting cell cycle and
proliferation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) constitutes a viable approach to enhance
engraftment and restore function in ischemic heart disease. We also generated a new type of nanoparticles
that enable myocardial protection via increased vasculogenesis in the ischemic heart. Furthermore, we
established an injectable and shape-recoverable tissue with GelMA-coated nanofiber scaffolds. In this project,
we aimed to develop novel approaches to enhance the engraftment of implanted hiPSC-CMs via integrating
nanomaterials, cell- and tissue-engineering technologies. Specifically, we will 1) develop a novel engineered
heart tissue which leverages the capacity of nanomaterials to release pro-vasculogenic molecules and promote
revascularization in these engineered heart tissues and in the infarct heart; 2) take the advantage of our
recently established protocol to induce the proliferation of survival cardiomyocytes inside the engineered heart
tissues; and 3) study if delivery of these novel engineered heart tissues to animals with acute or chronic
myocardial infarction leads to robust myocardial regeneration and repair."
10815767,"ABSTRACT
 Malignant melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer with an increasing incidence in the United
States. Unfortunately, no curative treatment exists for metastatic melanoma. Despite the significant advances
of molecularly targeted treatments (BRAF-, CTLA-4- and PD-1-targeted therapies) in treating metastatic
melanoma over the past decade, the 5-year survival is only 35% for metastatic melanoma patients. Thus, there
is an urgent need to develop alternative treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.
 Melanocortine-1 receptor (MC1R) is a distinct molecular target due to its high expression in >80% of
melanotic and amelanotic human metastatic melanoma. Our remarkable first-in-human results clearly
demonstrate the feasibility of using MC1R-targeted 68Ga-DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex for human melanoma
imaging. Recently, we have identified DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex(KD) peptide with 0.12 nM MC1R binding
affinity which is dramatically improved by 8.3-fold as compared to DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex. Moreover, the
replacement of -GG- with 8-Aminooctanoic acid (-Aoc-) linker further improves the MC1R binding affinity of
DOTA-AocNle-CycMSHhex(KD) peptide by 3.8-fold as compared to DOTA-GGNle-CycMSHhex(KD). Thus, we
propose to develop novel theranostic 203Pb/212Pb-DOTA-Linker-Nle-CycMSHhex(KD) peptides for imaging-
guided MC1R-targeted alpha radionuclide therapy (MC1R-TART), and combine them with immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) for melanoma treatment in this project. We hypothesize that novel theranostic 203Pb/212Pb-
DOTA-Linker-Nle-CycMSHhex(KD) peptides can be used for imaging-guided MC1R-TART, and the
combinations of MC1R-TART and ICIs can treat melanoma more effectively than MC1R-TART only.
 The objective of this project is to develop novel theranostic 203Pb/212Pb-DOTA-Linker-Nle-CycMSHhex(KD)
peptides imaging-guided MC1R-TART, and combine MC1R-TART with ICIs for melanoma treatment. Our
awarded US patents clearly demonstrate the originality and novelty of this project. Our positive preliminary
results strongly support our hypothesis and research design. Importantly, we have assembled a strong
research team with established expertise that is uniquely suited to carry out this exciting translational project.
The positive results of this project will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of combining MC1R-TART and
ICIs for melanoma treatment, and provide a new insight into the design of novel treatments for metastatic
melanoma. The success of this project will provide clinicians a novel valuable imaging tool (203Pb-peptide) to
identify MC1R-positive patients who will benefit from the treatments, determine patient-specific dosimetry for
safe and efficacious doses, and monitor patients’ responses to MC1R-TART and ICIs treatments. The success
of this project will pave the way for evaluating this novel treatment in future FDA-approved clinical trials,
provide patients with personalized diagnoses and treatments, enhancing the opportunity for cure to metastatic
melanoma patients."
10896902,"Research in the Hart Lab has focused on the central concepts of modular cell biology, as
put forward by Hartwell et al, 1999: how normal cells rely on an interconnected web of biological
processes for survival and proliferation, and how mutation rewires this web of dependencies into
disease states. We have developed experimental and computational tools for CRISPR-
mediated perturbation studies that provide an understanding of the hierarchical organization of
the mammalian cell and reveal context-specific genetic vulnerabilities.
 Our work can be reasonably divided into research on first-order effects of gene
perturbation, accurately measuring gene essentiality and differential essentiality, and second-
order effects including digenic interaction, functional buffering, and network approaches. We
developed the TKOv3 CRISPR/Cas9 genome-scale library for knockout screens in human and
mouse cells (Hart et al, 2017), as well as the BAGEL (Kim & Hart, 2021) and DrugZ (Colic et al,
2019) software packages for analysis of fitness and chemogenetic interaction screens. Our
integrative analysis of hundreds of cell-line screens from the Cancer Dependency Map initiative
yielded one of the first coessentiality maps describing functional linkages between human genes
(Kim et al, 2019); the first systematic survey of proliferation suppressor genes, discovering a
novel putative tumor suppressor role for saturated fatty acid synthesis in myeloid leukemia
(Lenoir et al, 2021); and one of the first integrated computational and experimental studies
confirming that functional buffering by, e.g., paralogs is systematically missed by monogenic
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens (Dede et al, 2020). These latter two works used the Cas12a
CRISPR endonuclease and its endogenous multiplexing capability to build efficient assays for
genetic interaction between targeted gene pairs.
 Our future work will deepen our understanding of how both first-order and second-order
effects shape modular biology, and improve our ability to decipher the natural complexity of the
cell by extending this work into higher-order effects from targeted polygenic perturbations. First-
generation network approaches integrate functional linkage across all contexts; future
computational work will decipher lineage-specific interactions to define more precise cellular
networks for functional genomics and tissue-specific disease modeling. On the experimental
side, we will continue to push the state of the art in genetic perturbation technology, developing
a highly multiplexed and multimodal perturbation platform that can go beyond digenic
interactions and provide deeper insight into the complexity of the mammalian cell."
10758613,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Mechanisms of mitotic regulation
 Defects in the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis underlie aneuploidy and other structural
rearrangements found in human cancers. The Stukenberg lab has studied mitotic regulation for 22 years and
recently shown human breast tumors dysregulate the transcription of a large numbers of mitotic regulators to
generate highly aneuploid tumors. Many of the most dysregulated transcripts were the Aurora B kinase, its
complex members and a signaling network that controls multiple mitotic events from the inner centromere of
every chromosome. The next phase of the Stukenberg lab will build on two recent breakthroughs that have
enabled new lines of experimentation to elucidate how these proteins ensure accurate chromosome segregation
and how dysregulation by tumors lowers this fidelity. First, we recently demonstrated that the Chromosome
Passenger Complex containing Aurora B kinase undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in vivo.
The insight that the kinase exists in a condensate enabled the reconstitution of a number of reactions in vitro.
For example, Aurora B kinase activates in condensates under physiological concentrations and conditions. It
has also elucidated surprising mechanisms for how Aurora phosphorylates kinetochores and activates
downstream kinases. Condensates also activate a microtubule bundling activity that is not seen with soluble
proteins. In fact, CPC rapidly generates microtubule parallel bundled structures that emanate from coacervates
with the opposite polarity of centrosomes representing a novel microtubule activity. Second, we have identified
new functions of the CPC in prophase including the generation of R-loops in the centromere. This new activity
was found by first purifying the complex from mitotic chromosomes where we identify 32 regulators of R-loops.
R-loops both direct the localization of the CPC and are required for cohesion of sister chromatids. The study of
Aurora B regulation of R-loops has suggested another exciting line of investigation of Aurora B in controlling
mitotic transcription. To increase the rigor and power of our experimentation the Stukenberg lab has developed
tools to combine in vitro reconstitution, in silico modeling and replacement of key point mutants in cell assays.
The result of these studies will provide important insight into how dysregulation of the chromosome passenger
complex drive aneuploidy in cancer cells and how to better combine Aurora inhibitors to effectively treat cancer."
10757321,"Project Summary/Abstract – Data Management and Bioinformatics Core
This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to further delineate the complex host/pathogen
interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia.
The SCRIPT2 Systems Biology Center is intentionally multidisciplinary, increasing the complexity of interactions
and mandating a centralized approach to facilitate accomplishing the goals of this Systems Biology Center.
The overall goal of the Data Management and Bioinformatics (DMBI) Core is to develop and implement new
and enhanced computational resources that support SCRIPT2, and to share those resources broadly. The
DMBI Core will sit at the nexus of SCRIPT2 where it will provide the tools, methods, skills and infrastructure to
collect, integrate, transform, analyze and distribute the diverse data generated by the projects. The design
and implementation of the DMBI Core is based on the premise that genome-centric approaches and phenome-
centric approaches are both inherently scientifically limiting. Rather, a systems biology approach that gives
equal weight to all data types is more likely to produce significant findings. For the first phase of SCRIPT, the
DMBI Core developed a rich data infrastructure to support the integrative analysis of clinical and multi-omic
data. We will build on this foundation for SCRIPT2. The DMBI Core will advance systems biology data
management in three areas. First, expanding beyond existing processes for data quality assessment,
automated real-time flagging of anomalies based on statistical properties of past data, external data, and
public knowledge will guide subsequent inspection toward technical rigor, biological novelty, the identification
of rare patient subgroups, and provide near-time identification of emerging changes in the pathologies present
by recent patients. Second, we will extend our existing SCRIPT infrastructure to allow rapid cohort
identification, hypothesis generation, and analytic dataset creation. We propose extending the open-source
Leaf query tool to perform both person-based and sample-based queries against both the Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model and study-specific datasets. Tracking of
specimens through the various stages of experimental and computational processing – and providing
estimates of future data availability – will assist project management and preparations toward future data
usage and modeling. Third, the combination of clinical data with multi-omic data with newer computational
tools that combine code and data creates unique data and security challenges. Expanding on our experiences
in SCRIPT to raise awareness of best practices for securely using and sharing data and models while ensuring
privacy, in SCRIPT2 we will streamline processes and develop novel tools and methods to ensure a rapid and
fair balance between privacy and data utility."

This innovative Systems Biology Center application seeks to model the complex host/pathogen interactions
occurring in patients with severe pneumonia. The overall goals of the Technology Core (TechCore) are to provide
sample processing, biobanking, and data generation support for all Projects and other Cores in the Super-
Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT2) Systems Biology Center. Our Technology Core
is uniquely poised to contribute to the success of the SCRIPT2 Study, as we possess expertise in flow cytometry,
cell sorting, cryopreservation, and various next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, including bulk and
single-cell technologies for gene expression (single-cell RNA-seq) and protein expression profiling (cellular
indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes [CITE]-seq), T and B cell receptor (TCR and BCR) clonotyping, genome-
wide DNA methylation analysis, metagenomics sequencing, and deep pathogen sequencing. The Technology
Core will process clinical samples, cryopreserve them, and then cryorecover them for pre-designated NGS
assays in close coordination with the Projects and other Cores. The data generated from the TechCore’s
activities will feed back to the DMBI and Modeling Cores to support the aims of Projects 1 and 2 as well as
iteratively inform sample selection to determine the most informative NGS assays to perform on a given sample.
The Technology Core has conceptualized its activities into two Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To immunophenotype and perform biobanking of BAL, nasal curettage, and blood samples
obtained from patients with severe pneumonia for subsequent NGS analysis. In Aim 1.1, we will use
multiparameter flow cytometry to immunophenotype subsets of epithelial and immune cells from samples
obtained from patients with severe pneumonia. In Aim 1.2, we will perform cryopreservation of all samples using
techniques that allow for downstream NGS assays on selected samples.
Aim 2. To perform NGS assays, including single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq, single-cell TCR and BCR
clonotyping, T cell subset DNA methylation analysis, metagenomics sequencing, and deep pathogen
sequencing on selected cryopreserved samples. We will cryorecover samples selected by the Projects in
conjunction with the DMBI and Modeling Cores to perform pre-designated NGS assays and subsequent
bioinformatics processing. We will also perform other assays, such as cytokine profiling, as directed by the
Projects."
10758529,"Previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, we assembled, under the same U19 mechanism, a multidisciplinary
team to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling
approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate host-virus networks that modulate
influenza A virus disease severity, biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and
novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. As a result, we have identified important host factors and
pathways involved in antiviral response and virus replication and disease, leading to potential treatments. The
sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted us to redirect our systems biology efforts to study
SARS-CoV-2 infections. We now propose to continue these studies under this U19 renewal application entitled
SARS-CoV adaptations through a Systems Biology Lens (SYBIL). Our underlying main hypothesis is that
host networks involved in SARS-CoV replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and
represent targets for therapeutic intervention. As these viruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, we will also
explore virus-host networks involved in human adaptation and responsible for changing the tropism from the
original bat host to humans. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in SARS-CoV replication,
pathogenesis and host tropism we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global
responses during infection in three systems 1) human blood and respiratory samples from human cohorts with
documented SARS-CoV infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) blood and tissues from
experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease
outcomes (Project 1) and 3) human and bat cells subjected to viral protein expression, genetic screens and
infection with diverse SARS-CoVs, including primary cells derived from iPSC precursors (Project 2). Samples
will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and
functional genomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to
generate specific hypothesis and network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify host and
virus key drivers of viral replication, host response, disease outcome and host tropism. Predicted network
regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to
identify new network models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management
and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover novel virus-host pathogenic networks,
blood biomarkers associated with them, determinants of human adaptation and specific therapeutic targets. In
summary, our modeling approaches will find associations between diverse experimental systems that will help
us define determinants associated with SARS-CoV bat-human host jumping COVID-19 severity, and link them
to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for risk assessment, companion diagnostics and personalized therapies."
10808862,"This project seeks to determine how voltage sensing domains control ion channel gating, a process
fundamental to all neuronal transmission, to control of endolysosomal delivery into cells, and recycling of
membrane proteins out to the plasma membrane. The aim is to determine the motion that is brought about
in voltage sensing domains upon activation based on the first atomic structures of a resting state and an
activated state in the same channel, an endolysosomal two-pore channel. The aim is to determine how this
structural change evoked upon voltage change is relayed to gate a central channel, by separating covalent
attachment by means of a direct protein sequence, from non-covalent interactions between the sensor and
the channel. The approach uses different two-pore channels, chemical cross linking, chemical trapping, and
mutations coupled to channel recordings, followed by atomic structural definition of intermediate states in
the process. With a related protein the aim is to visualize cellular complexes that associate with mucolipin in
the endolysosome. These partnerships impact many lysosomal and neuronal diseases and offer a map for
design of inhibitors of these processes that will lead the way to drugs that can be therapeutically
advantageous. The interactome of channels in the endolysosome offer an amazing network of connections
to disease that are a subject of this proposal. A second set of aims concerns how transmembrane
transporters, crucial to cell viability, transport essential nutrients into the cell, and function at the molecular
and structural level. By atomic structure determination of a transporter of essential phosphate, and others of
essential glucose, and of uric acid these transporters provide a roadmap to targeting these processes with
inhibitors and activators, that will be of therapeutic advantage in cancers, and are of use in regulating the
'master' regulators in the cell."

Cryptosporidiosis is a leading contributor to child morbidity and mortality worldwide, responsible
for over 200,000 deaths in children under two, and morbidity in over 7 million children. However,
we have limited treatment and no vaccine for use in young children. Our prior work in
Bangladesh has demonstrated that almost 80% of children in an urban slum cohort were
infected with Cryptosporidium spp. by age two and that infection, even without diarrhea, was
significantly associated with long-term growth faltering. Nitazoxanide is the only FDA-approved
drug for treatment of Cryptosporidium diarrheal disease. However, the drug has limited
widespread due to lack of large-scale, unbiased rigorous trials demonstrating its efficacy in
children under one and establishing its safety in this population. Furthermore, little is known
about how the drug could treat non-diarrheal infection and alleviate Cryptosporidium’s effect on
child growth.
Here we propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial aimed at treating children
ages 6-12 months with Cryptosporidium-diarrheal and non-diarrheal infection. The study will
evaluate the efficacy of treatment for both conditions and will also evaluate whether treatment
can improve growth in children for 6 months post-treatment.
This proposal leverages a longstanding collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and the
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease, Research, Bangladesh. This proposal is innovative,
as it will be the first randomized controlled trial aimed at treatment of non-diarrheal
Cryptosporidium infection and will evaluate impact on growth. The findings from this study will
inform treatment efforts aid to protect young children from this devastating infectious disease."
10740875,"SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACT
Five New World mammarenaviruses (NWMs) cause life-threatening viral hemorrhagic fever. NWM
transmission to humans most commonly occurs through inhalation of aerosolized viral particles or direct
contact with virus-containing rodent excreta or secreta. Pathogenic NWMs are considered priority pathogens
by federal and international public health agencies because they pose a significant public health risk and threat
to national security. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to treat NWM infection. A
distinguishing feature of the pathogenic NWMs is the ability to enter cells through human transferrin receptor 1
(TfR1), also known as CD71. Binding of NWMs to TfR1 occurs through the interaction of their envelope
glycoprotein GP1 subunit to the apical domain of TfR1, outside of the transferrin (Tf) binding site, which
presents a target for the development of broadly active therapeutics that disrupt viral GP1 attachment to TfR1
without interfering with cellular uptake of iron. We have developed a mouse/human chimeric antibody (Ab),
ch128.1/IgG1, targeting the apical domain of human TfR1 that effectively competes with pathogenic NWM
cellular entry in vitro and provides protection in a model of lethal JUNV disease that we developed using
transgenic mice expressing human TfR1 (huTfR1 Tg mice). Consistent with the competitive nature of the Ab
mechanism of action, protection was superior using a ch128.1/IgG1 mutant with impaired FcgR and C1q
binding, resulting in lack of Ab Fc receptor effector functions (Fc silent; Fc/s). Consistent with human data, we
also found that increased interferon-a (IFN-a) blood levels are important in the pathogenesis of severe NWM
infection. We have also recently developed a humanized version of ch128.1/IgG1 (hu128.1), which not only
increases the human content of the Ab variable regions for human use but also retains the chimeric Ab
properties and exhibits superior thermal stability, making it a better therapeutic candidate. We hypothesize
that TfR1 can be used as an effective target to neutralize NWM infection, not only using the anti-TfR1 Ab
ch128.1/IgG1 Fc/s but also using a new hu128.1 Fc/s as monomeric IgG1 and also as polymeric IgM-like IgG1
Ab. We also hypothesize that the use of an antagonistic Ab specific for IFN-a/b receptor IFNAR-1 (MAR1-5A3
Ab) would be effective in preventing severe NWM disease, used as a monotherapy or combined with anti-TfR1
Abs. To test our hypotheses, we have four Specific Aims. Aim 1: Define the ability of ch128.1 Fc/s and MAR1-
5A3 as monotherapy or combination therapy to inhibit/eliminate NWM infection in huTfR1 Tg mice; Aim 2:
Develop a hu128.1 Fc/s and an IgM-like hu128.1 IgG1 Fc/s as novel therapeutic Abs against NWM infection;
Aim 3: Define the antiviral activity of hu128.1 Fc/s and IgM-like hu128.1 IgG1 Fc/s in cell culture and huTfR1
Tg mice NWM infection models; and Aim 4: Define the properties of a selected anti-TfR1 Ab in non-human
primates (NHPs). This project will develop the scientific basis for the use of novel anti-TfR1 and anti-
IFNAR-1 Abs to treat NWM infection and result in a better understanding of the associated disease."

In this project, we will develop a new mouse model for quantitating gene therapy. To promote rigor and
reproducibility, we move away from single gene reporter systems and transition to multiplexed reporter
configurations that are amenable for a broad range of gene editing embodiments. Specifically, we have
designed an expression cassette composed of a monomeric near-infrared fluorescence protein suitable for
deep tissue measurements, a LacZ transgene that provides a rapid visible stain in whole organs and histology
sections, and laboratory evolved red-shifted luciferase that is designed for highly sensitive in vivo
measurements. This flexible configuration will benefit the research community, offering multiple readout
options for investigators.
The described mouse is engineered to detect a broad range of editing embodiments including Cytosine Base
Editors, Adenine Base Editors, Prime-Editors, CasFx, and perhaps others. This ‘all-in-one’ design will allow
researchers to minimize the number of animals needed, thus saving time and cost. It also promotes rigor and
reproducibility since different editing technologies that use the same animal can be more readily quantitatively
compared between research studies performed by different groups, using different delivery agents and
CRISPR embodiments. As of this writing, there are no such mouse models available, hence this project will
provide a novel and unique reagent for the gene therapy field.
We have assembled a strong team to tackle this project, guided by experts in base editors and prime editors
(David Liu and Jennifer Doudna) and mouse genetics (Michael McManus). The project also brings on board a
postdoc co-investigator with expertise in gene therapy in mouse models (Wilson Poon) who has developed a
mouse sensor designed for wtCas9 gene editing. Growing momentum and an ever-increasing body of
evidence indicates that base editors and prime editors will become front-runners in the race to clinical
therapeutics. The development of mouse models will greatly accelerate our goal to bring gene editing to the
clinic, helping to ensure a safer and more efficacious treatment."

There is an urgent need to develop new vaccination strategies that induce antibodies that
target relevant epitopes on complex microbes. Moreover, approaches that allow control of
the number and fine specificity repertoire of responding naïve or memory B cells would
fuel new vaccine designs for a variety of mutating viruses. This project centers on the
hypothesis that co-engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) for antigen with the Notch2
receptor will amplify responses by naïve and memory B cells. This hypothesis builds on
preliminary data showing that BCR+Notch2 co-stimulation increases both number of B
cells that respond and the number of proliferative events experienced by these cells. To
test our hypothesis, we will generate unique mosaic nanoparticles based on immunogenic
and sub-immunogenic variants of the HIV envelop (Env) antigen. We will answer the
following questions: 1) Does BCR+Notch2 co-engagement prime naïve clones to target
native-like Env variants?, and 2) Does BCR+Notch2 co-engagement on memory B cells
increase their contribution to GC and PC pools? These studies will provide unique and
needed insights into the potential exploitation of BCR signaling thresholds in emerging

Bipolar disorder (BD) is strongly associated with financial instability. Symptomatic periods in BD often
manifest in poor financial decision-making. For example, 70% individuals with BD have reported impulsive
spending during hypomania. Such problematic financial behaviors during symptomatic periods can lead to
serious long-term financial instability, which can severely impact the quality of life for individuals with BD and
their care partners. Maintaining financial stability is, thus, a critical challenge to ensure the long-term
wellbeing for individuals with BD. As such, there has been an increasing focus on understanding financial
behaviors of individuals with BD. However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding how idiosyncratic,
context-driven, and illness-specific factors impact financial decision-making in BD. Furthermore, the lack of
granular, in-situ assessment methods is a key challenge against developing just-in-time and personalized
interventions focusing on financial stability for this population. Given the importance of financial stability for
individuals with BD, this remains a serious knowledge gap with broad practical and societal implications.
In recent years, there has been a considerable progress toward more open and accessible financial data. We
argue that the granular and real-time access to financial activity data can lead to a paradigm shift in the domain
of financial wellbeing and BD. That is, it can provide a unique opportunity to explore the nuanced relationship
between financial behaviors and BD, uncover financial patterns indicative of early-warning signs, and develop
preemptive interventions to sustain financial stability and improve long-term quality of life for this population.
This project aims to advance this vision of using financial activity data as an objective behavioral marker in BD.
We will develop a prototype to collect privacy-preserving, customized financial data. The prototype will also
collect symptom and illness trajectory data. We will follow the Center for eHealth Research (CeHRes) roadmap
for implementation. We will use the prototype to retrieve financial data from individuals with BD (N=50) for
the last 24 months (i.e., 1200 months of financial data in total). We will use the data to develop and evaluate
privacy-preserving machine learning models to identify early-warning signs in BD. We will also conduct focus
group interviews to collect in-depth usability and acceptance data from individuals with BD.
This project will establish a preliminary evidence base regarding the feasibility and acceptability of using
financial activity data as an objective behavioral marker in BD. Given the association between BD and financial
instability, the project will provide crucial and urgent insights into assessment and intervention methods to
support financial stability and overall wellbeing in BD, including for those living in remote and rural areas."

Animal models are essential for understanding the mechanisms of development, and for
uncovering the early life origins of disease. The utility of these models depends on the effective
application of genetic methods to establish causal relationships between genes and phenotypes.
The goal of this proposal, targeted to the Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP), is
to build resources that dramatically improve the reproducibility, utility, and efficiency of research
in sea urchins - which are used by hundreds of researchers across numerous NIH-supported
projects. These resources include modular founder lines (“building blocks”) enabling myriad
approaches, from cell and stage-specific mutagenesis to combinatorial fluorescent reporter
expression, to active genetics. The Aims of this proposal utilize both traditional (transposon-
mediated transgenesis) and modern (CRISPR/Cas9) techniques to meet these diverse needs.
Further innovation of the work comes from application of this modular genetic design to a species
with the ideal biological features and background of knowledge for transgenesis and research-
scale culturing. This work will have transformative impact on research across the mandates of
NIH, including studies on reproduction, membrane transport, and gene regulation."
10796872,"Abstract
There is ample evidence that homelessness is associated with inadequate access to essential health services
and that African American, Hispanic/Latinx and rural populations are at high risk for homelessness and/or its
consequences. However, there is insufficient knowledge about gaps in use of specific types of healthcare
among homeless adults, whether such gaps are greater among minority and rural populations, and the
potential of permanent supportive housing (PSH) programs to mitigate the gaps. This study aims to: 1)
quantify the contribution of homelessness to gaps in essential health services use among Medicaid
beneficiaries by race/ethnicity and rural residential status; 2) evaluate the extent to which the gaps are
mitigated by placement in PSH programs; and 3) identify Medicaid and PSH policy and programmatic
strategies for improving access to essential health services and reducing associated racial/ethnic and rural
disparities. This study will overcome shortcomings in prior research by using novel large scale, population-
based, long-term data, combined with integrated quantitative-qualitative research methods. The study will
address the first two aims using 10 years (2011-2020) of linked homeless services and Medicaid administrative
data for New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The contribution of homelessness to healthcare gaps and disparities
will be measured by comparing utilization and spending for a broad spectrum of community-based and hospital
health services among adults experiencing homelessness to matched Medicaid beneficiaries who have not
been homeless. PSH will be evaluated by comparing trends in healthcare use and disparities by race/ethnic
and rural residential status among those receiving housing placements to adults in similar circumstances who
did not receive such placements. Specific actionable strategies for improving policy and practice will be
identified in focus groups with front-line PSH professionals during which quantitative findings will be shared
and discussed."
10828806,"ABSTRACT: Cholestatic fibrosis is the outcome of chronic liver diseases, including primary sclerosing
cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), secondary biliary cirrhosis (SBC). It is characterized by
extensive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagen Type I. Activated hepatic stellate cells
(aHSCs) and portal fibroblasts (aPFs) are the major source of the fibrous scar in the liver. aPFs have been
implicated in liver fibrosis caused by cholestatic liver injury. (AIM1) Here we propose to study the role of Msln-
Muc16-Thy-1 signaling in the pathogenesis of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2-/- mice. For this purpose, Mdr2-/- mice
are crossed to Msln-/- mice, Muc16-/- mice, or Thy-1-/- mice. To dissect the relationship between Msln-Muc16-
Thy-1, we generated Mdr2-/- mice devoid of both Msln and Muc16 (triple knockout Mdr2-/-Msln-/-Muc16-/- mice)
or Msln and Thy-1 (Mdr2-/-Msln-/-Thy-1-/- mice). The time course comparison of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2-/- and
BDL-injured mice will reveal similarities of aPF activation in both models. The paracrine signaling between
aPFs and cholangiocytes will be evaluated. (AIM2) We will investigate the unique mechanisms, common
mediators, and molecular factors that mediate activation of aPFs. We hypothesize that Msln induces a non-
canonical TGFb/TGFbRI-Smad2/3/4-activation of aPFs. Additional potential pathways of Msln signaling in aPFs
(such as FGFR-Msln-Akt/ERK and JAK2/STAT3) will also be evaluated. To dissect the mechanism by which
Msln-Thy-1 pathway regulates aPF functions, Col-GFP+Thy-1+Msln+ aPFs will be sort purified, and analyzed by
RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry. To elucidate novel signaling pathways, gene expression profiles and binding
partners of WT and KO aPFs will be compared. (AIM3) To translate our findings from mice to humans, the role
of human MSLN-THY-1 will be studied in human aPFs in vitro and in vivo. We have already isolated and
characterized human aPFs from 6 livers of patients with cholestasis. Human aPFs are identified by expression
of the “signature genes” MSLN, CA125, THY-1, BNC1, UPK1β, CALCA, GPC3. 2 selected human aPF cell
lines will be analyzed using shRNA-knockdown ± TGFb1, and RNA-Seq. Binding partners of human MSLN will
be identified by mass spectrometry using anti-human MSLN Ab. (AIM4) Our central hypothesis is that MSLN-
MUC16-THY-1 pathway plays an important role in activation of human aPFs in response to cholestatic injury,
and therefore serves as a target for anti-fibrotic therapy. We will test if ablation of MSLN with anti-MSLN Ab-
immunotoxins can suppress development of cholestatic fibrosis in “humanized” MSLN mice (in which mouse
msln gene was replaced with human MSLN gene) or liver xenograft Rag2-/-gc-/- mice (generated by adoptive
transplantation of GFP-labeled human MSLN+ aPFs into the livers of Rag2-/-gc-/- mice, this technique is
developed in our laboratory). Effectiveness of immunotherapy will be estimated in these mice by disappearance
of MSLN+ aPFs, and suppression of cholestatic fibrosis. We anticipate that anti-MSLN Ab-immunotoxins will
improve cholestatic fibrosis."
10821301,"OVERALL ABSTRACT
 The long-term goal of this Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) is to help grow the
burgeoning biomedical research industry in Maine by positioning the University of Maine (UMaine) as a
biomedical research and training hub that supports and recruits outstanding junior faculty while strengthening
our unique statewide graduate program. This COBRE is focused on Regulation of Cellular Behavior in
Response to Extracellular Cues. All cells interpret and respond to their environment, yet the mechanisms by
which cells process signaling inputs and parse them into discrete cell behaviors are not fully understood. How
does G protein coupled receptor signaling regulate polarity in different cell types? How does the extracellular
environment regulate muscle cell behaviors such as migration and regeneration? How do viruses modify cells
to cause disease? Five research projects led by early career investigators from UMaine and Mount Desert
Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) will address cell-microenvironmental signaling across three contexts :
mechanisms of viral infection in cultured cells and zebrafish; gradient tracking in yeast, and mechanisms of
muscle homeostasis in zebrafish. The five research projects are: Cellular reprogramming in Persistent versus
Lytic JC Viral Infections (Maginnis); Motility and Guidance Signals Control Migration of Muscle Precursors
(Talbot); Mechanisms of GPCR-induced Autophagy (Kelley); Apelin Signaling in Muscle Regeneration
(Madeleine), and Innate Immune Function in Influenza-Associated Myopathy (King).
 Each project leverages the unique expertise of research project leaders while advancing the theme of
extracellular impacts on cell behavior. Projects exploit existing IDeA resources and the proposed new core
facility in Microscopy and Image Analysis. This COBRE further enhances partnerships among biomedical
research institutions in Maine. As director of a state-wide graduate program with 54 graduate students and
>150 faculty, Dr. Henry has the leadership experience to guide this COBRE. This COBRE will accelerate the
careers of our Junior Investigators by adding: external senior scientists as mentors, state-of-the art live
imaging, image analytics, and an expanded zebrafish facility to strengthen the biomedical research
infrastructure.
 UMaine is the only institution in the state that grants doctoral degrees in biomedical science and
biomedical engineering. This COBRE, which will be UMaine’s first, will transform UMaine’s ability to serve as
the academic leader for biomedical research in Maine and feed the growing biomedical research industry in
Maine. This research will elucidate basic biological mechanisms underlying cell behavior, and also has the
potential to inform future treatment of infectious diseases, neuromuscular disorders, and muscle aging and
regeneration."
10821302,"ADMINISTRATIVE AND MENTORING CORE ABSTRACT
The Administrative and Mentoring Core will provide administrative leadership and direction for COBRE activities
across the two partner biomedical research institutions: the University of Maine (UMaine) and Mount Desert
Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL). Dr. Clarissa Henry, COBRE PI and UMaine Professor of Biological
Sciences, will serve as the Core Director. She will be supported by two Associate Directors, senior personnel
with extensive NIH funding and leadership: Dr. David Harder, University Research Professor of Medicine
(UMaine) and Dr. Iain Drummond, Professor and Director, Davis Center for Aging and Regenerative Medicine
(MDIBL). Administrative and Mentoring Core activities will include oversight of the mentoring and pilot project
programs, oversight of the Steering, External Advisory, and Mentoring Committees, preparation of progress
reports, and overall program evaluation. The committee structure of this core intentionally engages leading
scientists from other biomedical research institutions in Maine, including Maine Medical Center Research
Institute (MMCRI) and The Jackson Laboratories (Jax). The Administrative and Mentoring Core will also be
supported by staff from the Office of the Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School. This
core has four aims: (1) Provide administrative, scientific, and fiscal leadership, (2) Implement an effective career
development (mentoring) plan to facilitate the transition of junior faculty to independent RO1-funded
investigators, (3) Contribute to Maine’s interactive research network with regional research Institutions allowing
Center investigators to engage in collaborative research and enhance their COBRE experience, and (4) Evaluate
the proposed COBRE and establish a sustainable model. Taken together, these aims will ensure that the
research project leaders achieve independent RO1-level funding as well as transform the overall biomedical
research environment at the University of Maine."
10821303,"ABSTRACT: MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS CORE
The proposed COBRE will establish a center of excellence at the University of Maine (UMaine) focusing on
the impacts of extracellular signaling on cell behavior. The five interconnected projects in this proposal will
elucidate the intricacies of extracellular signaling, which will require sophisticated and dynamic analyses of
cellular structure in vivo. In addition, all five of the proposed research projects are structured around
longitudinal designs that require higher throughput imaging of live systems over a longer period of time. The
five projects will also incorporate novel, unbiased image analysis paradigms that will increase rigor and
reproducibility. To address these needs, the proposed COBRE Microscopy and Image Analysis Core (MIAC)
has two specific aims to provide training and access to (1) state-of-the art, high resolution live imaging services
and (2) experiment planning, image acquisition and image analysis services as well as data storage and
management. MIAC will provide training and access to state-of-the-art, high resolution live imaging
services, including a recently-acquired inverted Leica confocal/lightsheet microscope, an upright Zeiss
Airyscan2, and an Olympus FV-1000 confocal. In addition, funding through the NIH COBRE program will allow
UMaine to acquire an inverted Zeiss LSM900 with Airyscan2 confocal microscope designed for live imaging of
infectious disease, which will be a unique capacity in the state. MIAC will provide wraparound services from
experimental planning to expert data management and image analysis. These services are critical for
rigor, reproducibility and maximizing the impact of microscopy equipment on the proposed research projects
and for other users. The MIAC core will provide one-on-one mentorship of users in planning, executing,
analyzing, and storing their data. This will include instruction in the theory and practice of microscopy, as well
as ongoing support for microscope troubleshooting, image analysis with Zen, ImageJ, Matlab, Imaris and Aivia
software packages. The MIAC core is innovative in that it will leverage existing engineering, physics and
biochemistry expertise in imaging and analysis to guide projects and exploit the power of our microscopes and
analysis software from start to finish. The establishment of a Microscopy and Image Analysis Core at UMaine
will fulfill important gaps in biomedical infrastructure in the state and catalyze important new discoveries in how
cell behavior is governed by extracellular signaling in multiple contexts."
10794943,"Project Summary
In addition to motor and classical conditioning functions, the cerebellum contributes to motivation and reward
processes that underlie complex behaviors. To influence non-motor processes, such as feeding and food-
seeking behaviors, it is thought that the cerebellum modulates cortical and subcortical feeding centers. The only
path through which the cerebellum can influence feeding control is through cerebellar output circuits in the deep
cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Yet little is known about how DCN circuits are organized and whether distinct pathways
are dedicated to feeding and food-seeking behaviors. The recent identification of discrete subsets of DCN
neurons that project to thalamic, subthalamic and hypothalamic brain regions indicates the existence of neural
subtype organization to cerebellar output. Based on published and preliminary data, the primary hypotheses of
this proposal are that: 1) distinct DCN-mediated pathways project to known feeding centers to influence food
intake; and 2) these features identify distinct DCN circuits essential for feeding and/or metabolism; and finally,
3) dedicated DCN-mediated pathways are engaged during feeding, and influence the neural activity of specific
neuronal subtypes in key feeding centers. This proposal will test these hypotheses through three aims. Aim 1
delineates distinctions in target selectivity of specific DCN circuits. We will employ conditional viral tracing, and
genetic fate-mapping methods to define the output connectivity of DCN subpopulations to feeding centers
(paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus and zona incerta), which we hypothesize
influence feeding behavior. Additionally, we will determine if major subclasses of arcuate neurons (e.g. POMC
or AgRP) are linked to the DCN with specific Cre-lines and trans-synaptic rabies virus. In Aim 2, we will define
the role of DCN circuits in feeding control through optogenetic activation and silencing of discrete neuronal
subpopulations in the DCN. Specifically, we will examine how selective neural manipulation of anatomically-
defined DCN pathways influences food intake and metabolism, and dissociate output pathways for motor control.
Finally, the experiments in Aim 3 will determine the activity profile of discrete DCN neuronal subpopulations, and
how activity in these subpopulations changes neural activity of known feeding circuits in freely moving mice
during food intake using deep-brain imaging. By defining the anatomical and functional organization of cerebellar
output pathways, and their activity dynamics involved in feeding behavior, these aims provide insight into more
general mechanisms of how cerebellum controls motivation and reward circuits, and establish a framework for
exploring the more enigmatic cognitive roles of the cerebellum. A more comprehensive understanding of
cerebellar function will provide greater insight into how neurological disorders and injuries disrupt food intake,
and lay the groundwork for development of novel treatment strategies for obesity and eating disorders."
10767289,"There are over 350,000 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year in the United States, and the
success rates from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) average only about 10%. In addition, organ shortage
is the greatest challenge facing organ transplantation, with far fewer donors than needed, and many patients
dying awaiting transplant. Approaches that could enhance survival from cardiac arrest, and also increase the
number of organ donors, are, therefore, critically needed. One approach is implementing systems to enhance
blood flow during cardiac arrest, since enhanced flow increases survival. Even after 50 minutes of cardiac
arrest, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) can double survival rates over those from conventional
CPR. More than half of cardiac arrest victims treated with ECMO do not, however, have return of spontaneous
circulation (ROSC), and some patients with ROSC are brain dead. Patients with ongoing ECMO, but without
ROSC, or with brain death, represent a large pool of viable donors. Current ECMO systems, however, require
substantial special training for vascular access, and a perfusionist, limiting their widespread use. Newer ECMO
systems are being developed that allow more flow through shorter cannulas than with current systems. It is not
known, however, how much flow is needed for survival. If the critical amount of flow needed can be achieved
with the shorter cannulas used with the newer systems, then shorter, easier to place, and less morbid cannulas
can be used routinely, extending the use of ECMO to wider patient populations, including underserved areas.
We have developed an MRI compatible ECMO system and are using it while acquiring real-time magnetic
resonance derived cerebral flow, oxygen metabolism, and metabolite levels. Study of these brain parameters is
critical since brain function is the most important determinant of survival from cardiac arrest. The hypotheses
we are testing are that: 1) Metabolic parameters and cerebral blood flow will be preserved by critical amounts
of blood flow generated during resuscitation; 2) There are critical levels of blood flow that are needed during
resuscitation for neurologically intact survival; 3) There are critical levels of metabolic parameters, brain injury
biomarkers, inflammatory markers, and reactive oxygen species, measured during resuscitation, that predict
neurologically intact survival; 4) Adding CPR will reduce the amount of ECMO flow needed for survival; 5)
Intra-arrest hypothermia will reduce the amount of flow needed for survival; and 6) Reactive oxygen species
generated during resuscitation can be suppressed by critical levels of flow and hypothermia. One goal of this
program is to study the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of using an ECMO system that can be used without
a perfusionist, and that uses cannulas that can be inserted percutaneously by a markedly increased pool of
physicians. Another goal is to understand the determinants of survival and the minimum amount of ECMO flow
needed to improve survival. If successful, these systems should be able to deliver sufficient flow to increase
neurologically intact survival from cardiac arrest and increase the number of organs available for transplant."

Central venous catheters are indispensable healthcare devices used for a range of applications from
hemodialysis to critically ill patients. Unfortunately, central venous catheters provide a route for entry of
pathogens into the bloodstream, resulting in central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The
pathophysiology of CLABSI comprises two main routes of infection: the extraluminal route for short-term central
venous catheters, where microorganisms enter from the insertion site and colonize the catheter tip; and the
intraluminal route for long-term central venous catheters, where frequent line manipulation introduces
microorganisms into the lumen. While many approaches for CLABSI prevention focus on aseptic techniques to
mitigate extraluminal and, to some extent, intraluminal infections, intraluminal infections remain a major source
of CLABSI. Here, we propose to develop a non-antibiotic approach to prevent CLABSI using controlled
electrochemical reactions occurring in the catheter lumen to generate the biocide hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In
preliminary work, we showed antimicrobial activity of electrochemical HOCl generation on catheter surfaces, and
in a preliminary in vitro catheter model, demonstrated that this strategy may prevent CLABSI. We further showed
that HOCl concentrations and delivery rates are controllable by tuning electrochemical parameters. We term the
devices we propose to develop that will generate intraluminal HOCl as a CLABSI prevention strategy,
electrochemical intravascular catheters (e-catheters). eCatheters will use a novel intraluminal electrochemical
system designed to deliver HOCl at concentrations ‘tuned” to prevent microbial cell growth and biofilm formation
without causing host toxicity. The e-catheters will be controlled by custom-designed micropotentiostats for use
in animals (and, eventually, in humans). The developed devices will be tested against 12 species of bacteria and
yeast in vitro and evaluated in a rabbit model of intravascular catheter-associated infection to assess prevention
of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae CLABSI. The innovative e-catheter strategy provides an
original way to address CLABSI prevention, avoiding conventional antibiotics and therefore selective pressure
on commensal microbiota and emergence of antibiotic resistance."
10770441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is a subject of considerable scientific, clinical, and pharmaceutical
interest. High IOP is an established risk factor for glaucoma, an insidious disease that causes blindness by
killing retinal ganglion cells, so lowering IOP is a primary focus of all current treatments. The first approach
in clinical care is to prescribe patients medicines that alter the production and outflow of aqueous fluid in the
eye. Many of these medicines achieve a therapeutic effect by targeting signals from the autonomic nervous
system, which dynamically modulates aqueous humor dynamics for reasons that are not entirely known.
One of the strongest modulators is the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, which coordinates a circadian
rhythm in mean IOP. Other autonomic neuromodulators include stress and intracranial pressure (ICP). Their
collective actions cause IOP to fluctuate continually, sometimes reaching levels that would cause glaucoma
in some individuals if maintained for extended periods. Involvement of ICP in IOP modulation is particularly
intriguing because ICP contributes to the translaminar pressure gradient across the optic nerve head, which
determines the mechanical stress and strain profiles experienced by retinal ganglion cell axons as they exit
the eye to the brain. ICP could therefore factor into glaucoma pathophysiology as well.
The proposed research is directed at advancing our understanding of circadian and autonomic mechanisms
of IOP modulation and the potential involvement of these mechanisms in disease onset and progression. To
do this, one-of-a-kind technologies are used that provide researchers the ability to record or control IOP or
ICP round-the-clock in rats. IOP, ICP, body temperature, locomotor activity, aqueous outflow facility, and
ocular compliance will be concurrently recorded in various combinations as ambient light-dark cycle is
altered, sympathetic nerve agonists and antagonists are administered, and variable pressure loads are
transiently applied to the eye. In so doing, new insights will be gained about the origin and control of ocular
rhythms, about efferent control of IOP by ICP, and about possible roles of circadian and autonomic systems
in glaucoma. These insights could lead to new approaches and targets for disease treatment."
10796946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Immunotherapy has been celebrated as a breakthrough cancer treatment, but despite this success, most
patients fail to respond to treatment. Growing evidence indicates that the intestinal microbiota can contribute to
responsiveness to immunotherapy. The gut represents a key site for immune regulation, and the delicate balance
between immune surveillance and tolerance can fluctuate in response to changes in the microbiota,
subsequently influencing systemic immunity and affecting extra-intestinal diseases (21). We and others have
found that colonization with specific bacterial species in mice was sufficient to enhance anti-tumor immunity and
augment immunotherapy (2, 22). We observed that oral administration of a Bifidobacterium cocktail alone was
sufficient to improve tumor control and enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy anti-PD-L1 (2). The benefit
derived from Bifidobacterium appears to be connected to augmented dendritic cell function and CD8+ T cell
priming. While this prior study identified key characters orchestrating this microbiota-based effect, the link
connecting specific commensals in the gut to improved tumor control at distant sites is unclear, and whether
extensions can be made to human health and cancer patients was previously unknown.
 My objective during my Ph.D. is to determine whether we can observe similar phenomenon in cancer
patients, and to identify how intestinal commensals distantly affect the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with
our preclinical data, we and others have found certain taxa associated with response to immune checkpoint
blockade in cancer patients (1, 19, 20). Provocatively, we also observed that germ-free mice colonized with
responder patient fecal material exhibited more robust anti-tumor immunity and derived greater benefit from anti-
PD-L1 therapy compared to mice colonized by a non-responder. These data support a causal role for the gut
microbiota in improved immunotherapy efficacy. I hypothesize that microbiota-dependent differences in anti-
tumor immunity can be attributed to 1) microbially-derived or -induced circulating factors, 2) cells under local
microbial influence at the intestine that migrate to the tumor, or 3) a combination of systemic and cellular factors.
 Methods to engineer model bacterial systems are rapidly evolving (13-16). These tools enable us to test
hypothesis generated from mining databases with patient stool metagenomics data. The microbiome of cancer
patients has not yet been interrogated to discover microbial compounds linked to patient response. In my post-
doctoral work, I plan to focus on computational and synthetic biology approaches to find bacterial biosynthetic
gene clusters and evaluate these gene products anti-tumor immune potentiating properties. I hypothesize that
gene clusters overrepresented in the microbiome of patients that respond to immunotherapy can be expressed
in heterologous bacterial systems to identify anti-cancer or immune-potentiating small molecules. My overarching
goal is to continue building on the advances in this rapidly advancing field of the microbiome and cancer that will
translate into clinical action."
10794411,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The interplay between metabolic pathways and cell signaling networks that contribute to the “metabolic
reprogramming” in cancer cells remains largely unknown. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxiPPP)
plays a crucial role in the metabolic coordination of glycolysis, biosynthesis and redox homeostasis in cells by
producing precursors for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis, as well as antioxidant NADPH that quenches the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during rapid proliferation of cancer cells. There are three key enzymes
along the oxiPPP. The first enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) converts glycolytic
intermediate glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to 6-phosphogluconolactone (6PGL) and produces NADPH. The
second enzyme 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGLS) converts 6PGL to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG). The third
enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) converts 6PG to ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru-5-P) and also
produces NADPH. We recently reported that 6PGD is commonly activated by lysine acetylation in cancer cells
and activates lipogenesis through controlling its product Ru-5-P, which inhibits the LKB1-AMPK pathway by
disrupting the active LKB1 complex (Shan et al., 2014 Mol Cell; Lin et al., 2015, Nat Cell Biol.). Interestingly, we
found that knockdown of G6PD did not alter AMPK activation despite decreased Ru-5-P and subsequent LKB1
activation, due to enhanced activity of PP2A, the upstream phosphatase of AMPK. In contrast, knockdown of
6PGD or PGLS reduced PP2A activity. Mechanistically, knockdown of G6PD or PGLS decreased or increased
6PGL level, respectively, which enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of PP2A by Src. There are two forms of
6PGL, γ-6-phosphogluconolactone (γ-6PGL) is an oxiPPP byproduct with unknown function that is generated
through intramolecular rearrangement of δ-6-phosphogluconolactone (δ-6GL), while δ-6PGL is the only
substrate of PGLS and can undergo quick spontaneous hydrolysis. Thus, γ-6PGL is relatively stable compared
to δ-6GL but does not participate in oxiPPP. Further studies revealed that γ-6PGL, but not δ-6GL, promotes
Src-PP2A association, probably by binding to Src but not PP2A and enhancing PP2A recruitment.
 Thus, we hypothesize that G6PD, PGLS and 6PGD play differential roles in regulation of AMPK
homeostasis by balancing the opposing LKB1 and PP2A, through the oxiPPP intermediate Ru-5-P and an
oxiPPP “byproduct” γ-6PGL, respectively; and γ-6PGL, previously considered as a “dead end” byproduct of the
oxiPPP with unknown physiological function, functions as a signaling molecule that links the metabolic oxiPPP
with the Src-PP2A-AMPK signaling pathway. The specific aims are proposed: (1) To elucidate the molecular and
signaling basis underlying γ-6PGL-dependent contribution to AMPK activation through inhibition of PP2A by Src;
(2) To determine the differential effects of G6PD and PGLS on AMPK activation, redox homeostasis and tumor
growth; and (3) To evaluate combined therapy with oxiPPP inhibitors and AMPK activator in the treatment of
human leukemia and lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo."

The serious unmet need to address the excessive mortality observed in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS) has been brought sharply into focus by the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this R-44
application, Aqualung Therapeutics will address this therapeutic gap by utilizing a novel, humanized monoclonal
antibody, ALT-100 mAb, which binds/neutralizes a novel ARDS target, eNAMPT (extracellular nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase), to reduce ARDS/VILI severity. We have shown that eNAMPT functions as a DAMP
(tissue damage-associated molecular pattern) that binds Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to elicit profound NFkB-
driven inflammation, processes we have shown to be involved in pathobiology of ARDS and mechanical
ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Importantly, we demonstrated that eNAMPT is a highly druggable
ARDS target with the ALT-100 mAb profoundly attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammatory lung injury in
preclinical models of ARDS/VILI including a porcine model of septic shock-induced ARDS/VILI. We completed
GLP IND-enabling pharmacokinetic (PK) studies (T1/2 half-life of 12-14 days) and toxicity studies (rats/pigs)
which failed to identify any discernable level of toxicity even up to 50 mg/kg of ALT-100 mAb (28 day study).
Importantly, we have completed CMC and a 200L cGMP Bioreactor run (expression 6 gms/L) generating
sufficient mAb for completion of a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1A safety ascending dose study clinical trial in
healthy volunteers (beginning June 2022) and the Phase 2 A safety/efficacy study called PUERTA (Pioneering
the Utility of eNAMPT-Reducing Therapies in ARDS/VILI) in ARDS subjects with sepsis, septic shock, trauma,
bacterial or viral pneumonia, or COVID-19 infection. We anticipate FDA Investigational New Drug approval in
Q2 2022 for the ALT-100 mAb as an ARDS therapeutic intervention. This R-44 award will support the PUERTA
P2A trial of ALT-100 mAb in 90 severely hypoxemic subjects (2:1, ALT-100:placebo) with the diagnosis of
moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F <200) who are immediately treated with mechanical ventilation (MV), with high
flow nasal O2 (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV i.e. BIPAP/CPAP). SA #1 will assess safety, tolerability,
and PK of ALT-100 mAb at 2 dose levels (1mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) compared to placebo. SA #2 will assess the
capacity for ALT-100 mAb to reduce ventilator requirements (# ventilator-free days), the incidence of multi-organ
failure (MOF), the need for MV in HFNO/NIV-treated ARDS subjects, and reductions in plasma cytokines i.e.
pharmacodynamic effects [PD] SA #3 will assess predictive capacity of plasma eNAMPT levels and NAMPT
SNPs in identifying PUERTA subjects who respond to single dose treatment with ALT-100. The R-44 PUERTA
trial, overseen by our CRO, Prevail Infoworks and conducted at 5 academic clinical sites, will directly address
the unmet need for novel ARDS therapies and confirm eNAMPT as a highly druggable therapeutic target for
ARDS. Successful achievement of R-44 milestones will lead to further investigation of ALT-100 mAb in larger
pivotal P2b/P3 studies to determine efficacy of treatment with ALT-100 mAb to reduce ARDS/VILI mortality."

Anemia is characterized by low blood hemoglobin levels and has a high prevalence, affecting over one-third of
the world's population of about 2.5 billion people. More than 7% of the world’s population carry hemoglobin gene
mutations that result in hemoglobin variants, one of which is Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). SCD impacts about
100,000 Americans. The trait form of SCD is the Sickle Cell Trait, which results from inheriting a single copy of
the gene that causes the disease. Sickle cell trait affects up to 3 million Americans and 8 to 10 percent of African
Americans. 100 million people worldwide have sickle cell trait. Another major hemoglobin variant is β-
thalassemia, which affects approximately 1.5% of the world population. Optimal management of anemias, beta-
thalassemia, and SCD requires early diagnosis and monitoring of the patients using blood tests that measure
hemoglobin level and type. For example, in the United States, more than half of patients living with SCD are
treated with Hydroxyurea (HU). Regular blood transfusions are commonly performed in SCD. Efficacy in both
HU and transfusions is reflected in changes in hemoglobin (Hb) composition; HU increases the proportion of
fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and transfusions reduce the proportion of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). However, current
methods to monitor Hb composition require that samples be sent to a central lab, resulting in delays in patient
feedback, provider decision-making, and treatment modification. Treatment monitoring and management would
benefit from POC testing with immediate results. There is no FDA-approved point-of-care (POC) diagnostic
device for sickle cell or beta-thalassemia in the United States. We present Gazelle as the first and only POC
diagnostic platform for screening and treatment monitoring for SCD, beta-thalassemia, and anemias in the US.
In the SBIR Phase I/II Fast Track project phase, we established manufacturing and distribution partners overseas
and commercialized Gazelle for SCD and thalassemia testing outside the US with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa
and India. Our commercialization strategy for Gazelle has been focused on low-income Global markets, and we
have successfully achieved this goal with growing sales in 13 countries to date. The next step is to commercialize
Gazelle in the US market. The Phase II Bridge award is timely and critical for us to achieve this goal.
In this SBIR Phase IIB Bridge project, we plan to carry out and complete US-centric analytical and clinical
validation studies for FDA 510(k) applications and commercialize Gazelle in the US as the first and only
integrated POC diagnostic platform for SCD, beta-thalassemia, and anemia, as well as treatment monitoring of
HU and transfusion therapies. We will create a distribution strategy, develop partners, commercialize, and start
marketing the Gazelle diagnostic platform in the US."
10821322,"This study proposes to refine, integrate and disseminate the NeuroImaging Brain Chart (NIBCh) software
toolbox and machine learning (ML) model library, an ecosystem of software components enabling
constructive integration, statistical harmonization, and ML-centric data analyses across studies. NIBCh
enables large-scale analyses of multi-modal brain MRI data by mapping such data into a compact coordinate
system of informative neuroimaging signatures implemented by our library of ML models. The axes of this
coordinate system represent two types of information: 1) a variety of structural (sMRI and dMRI) and
functional connectomic (rsfMRI) imaging derived phenotypes (IDPs), such as multi-scale brain parcelations
and brain networks; 2) complex ML-based imaging signatures (ML-IDPs), which capture multi-variate
imaging patterns that reflect the heterogeneity of brain aging, neurodegeneration, as well as of
neuropsychiatic disorders and have been previously derived from carefully processed and curated data of
over 65,000 individuals. Using our software toolboxes (Tbx), researchers will be able to map new data into
NIBCh, and hence to use ML-IDP models trained in NIBCh, as well as perform statistical tests against NIBCh
normative ranges and compare their results with those of other studies using the same Tbx. The software
suite will include a set of containerized pre-processing and analysis pipelines, as well as statistical
harmonization and ML inference toolboxes, which will be accessible via a standalone python front-end
visualization, as cloud-based containers, and via a web-interface supported by our high-performance
computing cluster. Several dissemination plans are discussed, including a github user community, tutorials
at major technical and clinical meetings, and support of both standalone pipelines locally or on the cloud,
and web-based access of harmonization and ML inference modules.
 The over-arching primary goal of our program is to provide the software tools that will allow users to
contribute to an actively growing community-based dimensional neuroimaging system that will utilize
machine learning models to provide rich, yet precise, compact, concise, and informative representations of
brain structure, function and connectivity."

Pancreatic cancer (PCa) is one of the deadliest forms of cancers and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths
in the United States. Combination of gemcitabine (GEM) and paclitaxel (PTX) or Nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle
(NP) albumin-bound PTX, Abraxane®) is one of the first-line treatments for locally recurrent or metastatic PCa.
However, only limited benefits have been shown in clinic. In addition, this treatment is associated with significant
toxicity. PCa is characterized by the presence of dense stroma that may limit effective penetration of relatively
large-sized NPs. On the other hand, free GEM is rapidly eliminated from the blood circulation and is also
subjected to rapid inactivation by deaminase. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop small NPs that are
capable of protecting the drugs and are effective in tumor accumulation and penetration. We have recently shown
that conjugation of GEM to POEG-co-PVD polymer led to a significant decrease in the particle size from 160 to
13 nm. The resulting nanocarrier, named PGEM, was highly effective in tumor accumulation and penetration.
As a GEM prodrug, PGEM showed significantly improved antitumor activity in vivo. In addition, PGEM is highly
effective in codelivery of GEM and another hydrophobic drug such as PF-04136309 (PF), a CCR2 antagonist.
Flow study showed that PGEM treatment also led to increased CD8+ T cell response. However, we also observed
increased numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Mechanistic study showed upregulation of
CCL2 and CCL7 following treatment with PGEM. CCL2 and CCL7 are known to act on CCR2 on tumor cells and
immune cells and promote tumor invasion and metastasis through both direct impact on tumor cells and
recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. Our preliminary data showed that incorporation of PF into PGEM NPs
led to significant improvement in PANC02 model. More importantly this treatment resulted in a drastic
improvement in tumor immune microenvironment, which boded well with combination with anti-PD-1 treatment.
This application is focused on further improvement and characterization of PF/PGEM-based therapy. An
improved PGEM (PGEMi) will also be developed to improve the bioavailability of both PF and PGEM in tumor
tissues. Three specific aims will be pursued in this application: Aim 1 will develop and characterize PGEMi and
PF/PGEMi with respect to biophysical and in vitro biological properties. Aim 2 will define the tumor penetration
efficiency of PGEMi, and the PK and biodistribution of PF/PGEMi in murine and human PCa models including
PDX model.Aim 3 will investigate the toxicity profile and the therapeutic efficacy of PF/PGEMi in various PCa
models. Completion of this study may lead to the development of a new and improved combination therapy that
will advance the treatment of PCa."

This project is a small grant program R03 application for Dr. Eric Allenspach, an Assistant Professor in the
Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington (UW). He is a recipient of an NIH Mentored Clinical
Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) from the NIDDK and is currently in year four. Dr.
Allenspach is an attending physician in both the divisions of Pediatric Rheumatology and Immunology and has
a clinical and research interest in the treatment of pediatric autoimmune conditions. Dr. Allenspach’s specific
research interest is understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating autoimmunity including rare variants
and risk alleles. His long-term career goal is to become an independently funded principal investigator studying
genetic mechanisms of autoimmunity in both animal models and using human samples using basic and
translational approaches.
In the present application, Dr. Allenspach is requesting NIH R03 funding to support a new area of research
related, yet distinct, to his K08. Dr. Allenspach proposes studying the biologic role of an identified autoimmune
risk variant in the adaptor protein SH2B3 on the function of T cells in mouse models of type 1 diabetes (T1D).
A strong association has been found between a genetic allele (rs3184504) in the SH2B3 gene and T1D. In this
proposal, we utilize murine modeling to understand how reduced SH2B3 function affects T cells. The K08
proposal focused on the role of SH2B3 in shaping myeloid development, function and antigen presentation as
linked to T1D. Now, preliminary data from our group has identified a clear T cell-intrinsic role for SH2B3 in
regulating the IL-2 receptor pathway. A strong association has been found between the genetic risk allele
(rs3184504*T) and T1D and this allele encodes for a hypomorphic SH2B3 protein. Deficiency of Sh2b3 in
murine CD8 T cells renders them refractory to tolerance mechanisms in vivo as demonstrated in a murine
diabetes model. The mechanism driving this autoimmunity is not clear.
In this proposal, we will test whether deficiency in SH2B3 alters the TCR signaling threshold required for
proliferation and differentiation. We will leverage a well-established murine TCR-transgenic models coupled
with TCR signaling reporters and test this in vitro and in vivo. We will explore whether SH2B3 regulates all of
the common gamma chain receptors and how this signaling intersects with TCR signaling. We will also test
whether SH2B3 deficiency skews toward terminal effector memory cells, a known pathogenic phenotype of
CD8 cells associated with T1D progression. These basic studies will help inform the mechanistic
understanding of the SH2B3 genetic risk variant in promoting diabetes and can guide future human studies. It
is anticipated these studies would provide the publications and preliminary data needed to develop an
independent research direction and apply for R01 funding at the end of the career development support."
10770507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uveitis involving the posterior segment has the highest rate of vision impairment and development of ocular
complications among patients with uveitis. Clinical grading of vitreous inflammation utilizes the widely accepted
Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group criteria. However, several limitations exist with
the SUN criteria because it is a subjective, semi-quantitative, stepwise grading system. A rapid, reproducible,
and quantitative technique to evaluate inflammation is of paramount importance. The NEI-funded First-line
Antimetabolites as Steroid-sparing Treatment (FAST) Uveitis Trial was a multicenter, randomized, parallel,
observer-masked clinical trial where 216 participants were randomized to receive oral methotrexate 25 mg
weekly or oral mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily. All participants were at least 16 years of age and had
active non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis in at least one eye and had justification for starting
corticosteroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy. Participants in this trial were followed up over a period of 12
months. As part of the FAST Trial, all participants underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging at
baseline and at monthly intervals during the 12-month follow-up period. The robust and detailed nature of this
randomized clinical trial combined with standardized OCT imaging at every visit will allow us to evaluate
objective imaging biomarkers of vitreous inflammation, compare these biomarkers with clinical grading, and
correlate these biomarkers with clinical outcomes and development of ocular complications. This proposal is
for a secondary analysis of the FAST Trial OCT dataset and we will pursue the following specific aims: 1)
develop a standardized, reproducible technique using OCT to quantify vitreous cells, 2) evaluate a
reproducible technique using OCT to quantify vitreous haze, and 3) create a predictive risk stratification model
based on objective measures of intraocular inflammation. The long-term goal is that these results would
support the use of objective measures in routine clinical practice and as endpoints in clinical trials.
The aims of this study will address the NEI strategic plan for the area of emphasis relating to the “Immune
System and Eye Health”. This study will identify imaging biomarkers of ocular inflammation that will help in
disease detection and surveillance. Ultimately, earlier detection and improved monitoring of uveitis can prevent
permanent vision loss and disability."
10914763,"Project Summary
DNA replication is performed by numerous proteins that act as a dynamic machine, termed a replisome. The
core components of the eukaryotic replisome consist of 1) an 11 subunit “CMG” helicase that separates the
parental DNA strands, 2) The leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases (Pol), Pol d and Pol e,
respectively,3) The PCNA sliding clamp that encircles DNA and tethers both Pols to DNA for high processivity,
4) the RFC clamp loader pentamer that loads PCNA onto DNA and 5) Pol a-primase that makes a hybrid RNA-
DNA primed site for the Pols to initiate DNA synthesis. In addition to these “core” components, there are
several ancillary proteins including RPA, Tof1, Mec1, Csm3, FACT, Mcm10, Ctf4, Ctf18-RFC. There are a host
of proteins that assemble two CMGs around duplex DNA at origins. The CMG dimer unwinds the closed
duplex in an unknown reaction and scaffolds enzymes to assemble replisomes. We have purified these
proteins in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; S.c.) system. In this proposal, we will extend our studies on
the structure/function of the eukaryotic replisome. We will use biochemical and single-molecule methods to
determine if PCNA accumulates on the lagging strand as expected, and whether PCNA may periodically be left
on the leading strand for mismatch repair and assembly of naïve nucleosomes. We have solved numerous
structures with our collaborator, Huilin Li (VanAndel Institute, MI), and have many more structures in progress
and planned. We have purified the several factors of the ATR DNA damage checkpoint signaling system of
which many replisome proteins are targets of this pathway. We plan biochemical studies that will clarify targets
and their effect on replisomes. We will determine the mechanism of nucleosome inheritance during replication.
In metazoans, epigenetic inheritance of nucleosomes, gone awry, can lead to cancer and other diseases. In
yeast, cell studies have shown that a Mcm2 histone binding mutant prevents epigenetic transfer to lagging
strands, and Pol e lacking the Dpb3/4 subunits does not transfer epigenetic marks to the leading strand. We
plan to visualize nucleosome transfer during replication in real time using single-molecule studies with our
newly acquired Q trap) in collaboration with Dr. Shixin Liu (Rockefeller University)). We have various
nucleosome mobility factors and yeast nucleosomes having different fluorescently tagged histones for these
studies. Replication occurs in nuclear foci, having “replication factories” with many DNA replication forks. Our
recent biochemical and structural studies have defined the composition and atomic structure of the most basic
unit of a replication factory, a dimeric replisome. We will employ super resolution microscopy to validate if our
reconstituted factory is the same as that inside cells. We have insight into how duplex DNA at origins is opened
into single strands from our recent finding that the twin CMG helicases encircling duplex DNA at an origin are
directed inward, opposite the “outward” direction thought for a decade. We find that two inward directed CMG
can shear DNA apart. We have plans to further this line of investigation."

 The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), a heteromeric six-subunit protein
complex, is essential for DNA replication. ORC's functions also extend beyond DNA
replication. The smallest of ORC subunits, Orc6 protein, is important for DNA
replication in all eukaryotes. We have shown that in Drosophila Orc6 has an additional
role in cytokinesis through interaction with the septin complex, a highly conserved
polymerizing protein assembly that is critical for cytokinesis in many species and is
recognized as important component of the cytoskeleton. In preliminary studies we
solved the structure of human Orc6 and identified its structural features that contribute
directly to the functions of the protein in replication and cytokinesis. We characterized
the mutations in different domains of Orc6 leading to Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) in
humans, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by primordial dwarfism and
developmental abnormalities. We showed that despite different underlying molecular
mechanisms these mutations resulted in similar phenotypes, defects in pre-RC
formation and impaired DNA replication. Thus, the diverse molecular functions of Orc6
can be experimentally dissected to obtain a complete understanding of its discrete
roles in the cell. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the distinct mechanisms
of metazoan Orc6 function in DNA replication and in cytokinesis using Drosophila as a
model system. We established a humanized Orc6-based Drosophila model system
which will be used to analyze the effects of naturally occurring and structure-guided
targeted mutations of human Orc6 in protein functions. Regulatory insights into
replicative and non-replicative functions of ORC in metazoans are limited, despite
decades of research. Our completion of this project will help to fill this gap in our
understanding of diverse ORC's functions in metazoans and provide clues as to how a
specific mutation or mis-regulation would lead to growth and developmental defects."
10904636,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is the most common etiologic agent of bacteremia and hematogenous sequelae.
In methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) bacteremia, up to 35% of patients succumb even on gold-standard antibiotic therapy,
equating to nearly 20,000 deaths/year in the U.S. alone. In many cases of MRSA bacteremia, isolates are susceptible
to antibiotics in vitro but not cleared from the bloodstream even on appropriate therapy. Survival of MRSA in vivo despite
antibiotic susceptibility in vitro is termed antibiotic persistence. Persistent MRSA bacteremia (PB) is a life-threatening
emergency correlating with worsened outcomes and escalation of antibiotic use. This vicious cycle of persistence
driving antibiotic escalation driving antibiotic resistance is an NIH high–priority concern.
 A long-standing mystery is central to PB infections: the MRSA isolate is susceptible to antibiotics in laboratory
testing—but not in the human being. Importantly, persistence reflects a unique type of treatment-refractory infections
distinct from biofilm-mediated or classical antibiotic tolerance or resistance. Rather, persistent MRSA are elusive: they
adapt to host immune responses and antibiotic stresses in vivo and then revert quickly in vitro. Presently, there are few
therapeutic options for PB due to MRSA. Further, despite several meritorious attempts, vaccines targeting MRSA have
not achieved efficacy in clinical trials to date. Thus, there is a critical, unmet need to define the interactions of the human,
MRSA pathogen and antibiotic factors driving persistence outcomes.
 To address these challenges, we have designed independent Specific Aims that are highly synergistic with those
of other Projects & Cores to: 1) specify the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by which MRSA adaptively persists in
vivo; 2) discern how persistent MRSA subvert immune memory; and 3) define protective vs. non-protective immune
contexts that differentiate MRSA persistence vs. resolving outcomes. We will apply state-of-the-art technologies to
comprehensively analyze dynamic host-pathogen relationships leading to PB outcomes in context of antibiotic, host sex
and time in vitro and in experimental models. In turn, these data will be analyzed using powerful bioinformatics and
computational methods to detect hidden patterns within large complex datasets. Beyond new mechanistic insights, our
innovative studies are designed to discover translatable interventions that overcome MRSA persistence. This knowledge
will accelerate new strategies to predict, prevent and treat PB infections to improve and save lives. Strategies successful
in addressing MRSA persistence may also be applied to infections caused by other high-priority MDR pathogens. Our
systems-based approach to achieving these goals is ideally aligned with priorities of the National Institutes of Health."

In hospitalized patients, the fungus Candida albicans invades the bloodstream and causes hematogenously
disseminated candidiasis (HDC). The mortality associated with this infection approaches 40%, even with
antifungal current antifungal therapy. Because Candida spp. constitute the third most common cause of
nosocomial blood stream infections, HDC is a serious public health challenge of increasing medical and
socioeconomic importance. A better understanding of both the fungus and the host is required to develop new
approaches to diagnose, prevent, and treat HDC. Characteristics of both the fungus and the host determine
which patients develop HDC, and among those, which ones develop persistent candidemia and/or succumb to
infection. However, these characteristics are incompletely understood. To address this fundamental gap in
knowledge, we propose to analyze an existing biorepository of host and fungal samples selected from a cohort
of 300 patients with candidemia. We will compare samples from 35 patients with candidemia who died with those
from 35 matched candidemic patients who survived. We will also analyze serial isolates from selected patients
with persistent candidemia. Using this biorepository and associated clinical information, we will link fungal
genotype/phenotype, and host epigenetics, immune responses, and signaling pathways to patient outcome.
Specifically, we will 1) determine C. albicans genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic signatures
associated with lethality and persistence during candidemia and 2) determine the host response to lethal vs.
non-lethal and persisting vs. resolving C. albicans clinical isolates, with a focus on signal transducer and activator
of transcription (STAT) molecules. The data generated by the project will be compiled by the Bioinformatics and
Data Monitoring (BDM) core and analyzed by the Computation and Predictive Modeling (CPM) core to identify
both fungal and host signatures that are associated with persistent and lethal candidemia. These signatures will
then be tested by mutational and gene silencing approaches to refine the models and generate new hypotheses
that will be tested in an iterative fashion. The results of this comprehensive analysis hold promise to lead to new
approaches to predict, prevent, and treat HDC."

With the recent revolution in artificial intelligence for molecular design and protein structure
prediction, we were motivated to apply these new tools to address bottlenecks in our research
focusing on retroviral entry, integration, and drug design. Viral entry and receptor usage has
become a major focus with the emergence of new viruses with expanded host and tissue
specificities. Our research focuses on the ability of retroviral Envelopes to select and utilize novel
host cell receptors. In this proposal, we are utilizing new approaches to identify and study two
novel retroviral Env proteins and their host cell receptors. These include the binding of the A5/A9a
Env protein to the host membrane protein SLC35F2 and the identification of the cognate
receptor(s) for the L1 Env. Applying AlphaFold2, Phyre2 and Evolutionary Covariance structure
prediction programs, we have a first generation model for SLC35F2, which serves as the
foundation for a broad number of questions relating to the function of this orphan receptor. The
second area of focus builds on the gammaretroviral Integrase (IN) protein binding to the host BET
proteins. Through our structural studies of both the Murine Leukemia Leukemia (MLV) IN protein
and the host NSD3 protein binding to the ET domain of the Brd3 BET protein, we are now able to
apply our knowledge of the common binding pocket to advance approaches for studies of
alternative binding substrates and small molecule inhibitors. The ET domain of the BET family of
proteins serves as a node for multi-protein assemblies. Understanding the affinity of different
proteins and small molecules to this ET binding pocket can have profound effects of
gammaretroviral pathogenesis as well as gene and oncogene regulation. Using computer-aided
drug discovery approaches, we have identified first-in-class lead compounds targeting the ET
domain. These studies build on our cohesive collaborative research team with expertise in
virology, NMR structural studies, and bioinformatics."
10768597,"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the most common etiology of dementia in the elderly
including veterans. Since proportion of the elderly population is progressively increasing, VCID has become a
significant problem for elderly citizens, especially veterans. Therefore, the study of this disease is relevant to
veterans’ health and thus the mission of the Veterans Administration. VCID involves multiple risk factors, such
as hypertension, cardiac disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Over 40 million Americans
aged 70 years or older have at least one of these metabolic risk factors, yet we know relatively little about how
these risk factors contribute to VCID.
Recently, elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in blood has gained attention as a biomarker and
a risk factor for vascular disease. ADMA catabolism is reduced by decreased expression/activity of its catabolic
enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) under conditions of vascular disease. Secondly,
DDAH dysfunction and ADMA elevation contribute to dysfunction of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase
(eNOS) leading to vascular and endothelial disease. ADMA uncouples eNOS leading to dysfunction of redox-
based NO metabolism with excessive production of peroxynitrite (ONOOˉ). ADMA is also reported to reduce
cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. While decreased CBF and BBB disruption
have been highly implicated in the pathogenesis of VCID, the role of ADMA in VCID-related pathogenesis, as
well as underlying endothelial/vascular mechanisms are not well understood at present. Therefore, the goal of
proposed study is to investigate ADMA as an intermediary mechanism between the known risk factors and
VCID-related brain pathologies and to evaluate the therapeutic strategies targeting the ADMA-induced
endothelial eNOS/NO dysregulation for VCID associated brain disease.
To understand ADMA-mediated mechanisms in VCID, we have recently investigated the role of ADMA in
vascular and neurocognitive-pathologies in a mouse model of early-onset cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA:
Tg-SwDI). CAA is known to promote VCID through a number of mechanisms including inflammation,
hypoperfusion, and loss of BBB function and integrity. From these initial investigations, we discovered that
ADMA overburden during the course of CAA causes an increased BBB dysfunction, loss of brain microvessels,
neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline with increased endothelial nitrosative stress. These findings led us
to hypothesize that overburden of blood or brain ADMA levels, as a result of defective DDAH activity, drives
VCID-related microvascular pathogenesis in the brain by disturbing the vascular/endothelial NO homeostasis.
VCID is a multifactorial and complex disease. At present, therefore, there is no specific animal model that is
considered as the gold standard for assessing VCID pathology and therapeutics. We propose to investigate
the role of ADMA in VICD pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms using two mouse models of CAA and
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) which are the most relevant to VCID pathogenesis.
Specific Aim 1: To investigate the role of impaired ADMA catabolism in VCID-related pathologies: Studies
are proposed to assess the role of ADMA overburden and DDAH dysfunction as disease modifying factors and
thus therapeutic targets for VCID-associated vascular and neurocognitive pathologies using the pharmacological
(exogenous ADMA treatment) and genetic (use of DDAH1-Tg and DDAH1-Ko mice) approaches.
Specific Aim 2: To investigate the role of imbalanced NO metabolism (ONOOˉ > GSNO) in ADMA-
induced cerebro-microvascular dysfunction: Studies are designed to investigate the mechanism(s)
underlying ADMA-induced dysregulation of eNOS activity in brain microvessels and associated vascular
disease, specifically, the role of ADMA in imbalance of NO metabolism to ONOOˉ vs. S-nitrosoglutathione
(GSNO), which play opposing roles in maintenance of brain microvessel endothelial barrier integrity."
10768566,"ABSTRACT
As one of the most common pregnancy complications, nearly 600,000 women in the United States suffer from
postpartum depression annually. Consequences of postpartum depression are far-reaching and include
maternal suicide, functional impairment, and impaired development and psychiatric illness in offspring. Despite
the high prevalence and significant consequences, under current treatment paradigms less than 16% of
women with postpartum depression receive treatment and only 3.2% in total achieve remission. Treatment
uptake in this population is influenced by concerns regarding pharmacotherapy during lactation and caregiving
demands for a newborn. Novel treatments that remove the significant obstacles to accessing care inherent to
the postpartum period, such as non-pharmacological therapies delivered in-home, are urgently needed. Within
the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain of arousal/regulatory systems, the circadian timing system and
its alignment with the sleep-wake cycle—called the phase angle difference—represents a promising novel
treatment target. Morning bright light therapy advances circadian timing, and is an effective antidepressant for
seasonal and non-seasonal depression. Importantly, bright light therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention
that is administered in-home. However, its efficacy in postpartum depression, and mechanism of action, have
not been confirmed. Further, traditional light therapy delivered via light box has limited utility for postpartum
women, as the user must remain stationary during the treatment and it may expose the infant to light. Through
recent technological innovations, wearable bright light therapy devices (i.e., Re-Timer®) are now available;
advantages for postpartum women include freedom of movement during treatment and targeted light exposure
limited to the user’s ocular area, so infants are not exposed to the light. The proposed study is a randomized
controlled trial of Re-Timer® bright light therapy relative to dim (credible and biologically inactive) placebo light
for postpartum depression with the following specific aims: AIM 1: Establish the effect of a wearable morning
bright light therapy (n = 60) vs. dim light placebo (n = 60) on clinician-rated postpartum depression symptoms.
AIM 2: Establish changes in phase angle difference (relationship between sleep and circadian timing) as a
predictor of improvement in postpartum depression. AIM 3: Test the effect of morning bright light therapy on
secondary outcomes (self-reported depression and maternal functioning). Treatment adherence will be
objectively assessed, and objective assessment of sleep and circadian timing will allow for mechanistic testing.
This project will be the first to test the efficacy of wearable bright light therapy for postpartum depression and to
establish sleep-circadian alignment as a mechanism of treatment. It will lay the foundation for integration of
morning bright light therapy into standard care for postpartum depression, and for personalized applications of
the therapy. This proposal addresses NIMH’s high priority area for perinatal mental health—testing innovative
non-pharmacological interventions as alternatives to traditional interventions—within the RDoC framework."

An estimated 1.6 million persons in the US suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD), which costs society $787
billion a year resulting from excess healthcare expenditures and societal resources. Evidence-based treatments
for OUD have been shown to improve health and attenuate healthcare costs, but utilization continues to be low.
Models of hospital-inpatient addiction consultation and linkage to community-based treatment following
discharge have preliminarily demonstrated effectiveness; however, little is known about the economic value or
sustainability of such models in public hospital settings. In 2018, to improve post-discharge utilization of
evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD, New York City Health & Hospitals, the largest municipal hospital
system in the US, introduced the Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH) intervention.
CATCH is an addiction consult model which evaluates individuals with an opioid-related hospitalization for OUD,
initiates pharmacotherapy when indicated, and directly links patients to post-discharge treatment. An ongoing
NIDA-funded hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial is evaluating CATCH with regard to increased treatment
engagement, acute care utilization, and collecting implementation outcomes within the Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, the most widely applied framework for
measuring the impact of an intervention in real world environments. The study’s economic component focuses
on estimating the intervention costs and potential cost-offsets resulting from reductions in acute care utilization
and premature mortality. However, the participant population is primary composed of Medicaid beneficiaries and
key stakeholders will benefit from expanded economic information (additional healthcare paid by Medicaid, social
safety-net expenditures funded via state budgets) and tools to evaluate the viability of CATCH in a representative
setting. This project will leverage the research infrastructure of the aforementioned study to substantially increase
the economic information available to stakeholders, most specifically those who are largely responsible for
making treatment-access decisions on behalf of the study population, i.e., policymakers. This project will
estimate the costs required to implement and sustain the CATCH intervention utilizing data already collected as
part of the parent study to build a customizable budget impact tool that allows costs to be calculated for each
component of the RE-AIM framework for stakeholders (e.g., other public hospitals). The project will also estimate
the economic value of CATCH relative to treatment-as-usual from a state policymaker perspective by
incorporating: 1) nationally representative Medicaid unit costs of healthcare services 2) Medicaid claims data on
ambulatory care services, dispensed pharmaceuticals, and subsequent treatment for OUD in community and
outpatient settings as part of the total cost of the CATCH intervention; and 3) additional non-healthcare social
safety-net expenditures to support comparative assessment and resource allocation decisions by stakeholders."

impairs health-related quality of life, has no FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments available. Current trials
include only a narrow subset of SjD patients who are anti-SSA antibody positive (SSA+), excluding 25% of SjD
patients who are anti-SSA antibody negative (SSA-). SSA- SjD patients have distinct clinical phenotypes from
SSA+ patients. Recently, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been implicated in SjD salivary gland
pathobiology and represent a novel targetable cell type in this disease. Thus, there is a critical need to develop
new targeted therapy that takes into account the heterogeneity of SSA+ and SSA- SjD patients and to further
define the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of SjD. Our long-term goal is to use SjD pathogenic insights to
create new cell-targeted therapy. The goal of this project is to define the transcriptomics of MSCs within salivary
gland tissue. We also will determine the lymphocyte subsets in proximity to salivary gland MSCs and determine
how these subsets differ between control and SjD glands and, within SjD, between SSA+ and SSA- glands. We
hypothesize that SjD has unique MSC subtypes and they will promote differential local cellular milieu from
controls and between SSA+ and SSA- subjects. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on our data showing
IFN𝛾-treated MSCs are capable of acting as antigen-presenting cells and promoting T-cell chemotaxis. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific Aims. Aim 1 will provide an integral understanding of
the SjD transcriptional phenotype of a novel cell type, the MSC, compared to controls. Aim 2 will define how the
cellular molecular framework of MSCs and overall inflammatory cell composition differs between SSA+ and SSA-
subjects. To accomplish these Aims, FISH combined with Hybridization Chain Reaction based signal
amplification will be used to perform spatial genomics and rapid multiplexed immunofluorescence protein
profiling of salivary gland tissue. MSC subtypes, lymphocyte interactions with MSCs, and differential lymphocyte
composition between control, SSA+ and SSA- subjects will be determined using a series of spatially resolved
cell state and interaction analyses. This project builds an interdisciplinary team integrating experts from single
cell biotechnology, SjD and rheumatology, stem cell biology, pathology, and bioinformatics to create an atlas of
MSC phenotypes that can be used to enhance SjD’s stem cell therapies. The proposed application is innovative
because it uses cutting-edge technology to define spatial genomics and proteomics of salivary gland tissue and
shifts from the traditional focus on SSA+ subjects alone, toward differences between SSA+ and SSA- salivary
glands. This research is significant because it defines SjD MSCs, a potential novel therapeutic target, and
because it details spatial profiling differences between SSA+ and SSA- gland tissue, a critical step toward
understanding the difference between these clinically distinct phenotypes."

While neuro-oncologists rely heavily on medical imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
detection and sizing of brain tumors, they do not have access to a robust method that shows the active
metabolism of tumor lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) detection of the radioactive glucose analog
18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) is widely used for metabolic imaging of many solid cancers outside of the brain. FDG-
PET detects high glucose uptake, which is often a sign of active and growing tissue, such as in proliferating
tumors. However, when used for scanning tumors in the brain FDG-PET has shown to be often inconclusive.
This is not due to any technical limitation, but merely the consequence of the high glucose uptake of normal
brain, leading to high background signal and thus low metabolic image contrast between brain and tumor.
 Choline is an essential nutrient, and proliferating cells need choline for phospholipid and membrane
synthesis. As a result, many types of cancer have evolved with a high capacity for choline uptake and
metabolism. In contrast, choline uptake in normal brain is in comparison very low. Our preliminary data indicate
that the detection of deuterated choline uptake and metabolism using the novel technique Deuterium Metabolic
Imaging (DMI) can provide high brain tumor-specific image contrast with surrounding brain. DMI of deuterium
(2H)-labeled choline allows detection of choline uptake and/or choline metabolism, simply by varying the timing
of the scan in relation to the start of the choline administration. These features make choline DMI a very promising
metabolic imaging technique for use in brain tumors.
 The overall objective is to investigate the potential of choline DMI as a metabolic imaging method for brain
cancer. In this R03 research project we propose to investigate the value of mapping choline uptake and
metabolism with DMI as correlate for brain tumor grade and prognosis (Aim 1), and evaluating treatment effect
(Aim 2). We will use two established mouse models of brain tumor grade 3, and grade 4 glioma, and test the
effect of temozolomide, the standard of care chemotherapeutic, on tumor choline uptake and metabolism.
 Choline is an essential nutrient and used as a nutritional supplement within and outside of clinical settings,
at very high but safe doses. Deuterium is a stable isotope and commonly used as a tracer for metabolic studies.
Finally, DMI is a highly translatable imaging technique, already applied in clinical research settings. Therefore, if
the potential of mapping of choline uptake and metabolism is established in these rodent models, rapid
translation of DMI for detection of deuterium-labeled choline in human patients is relatively straightforward."

The overarching objective of this project is to develop and establish the diagnostic accuracy of a telemedicine-
based delirium assessment tool, the TELE-CAM.
Delirium, an acute change in cognition and attention is associated with a variety of undesirable outcomes
including increased in-hospital mortality, long-term cognitive decline that mimics dementia, and increased risk
for institutionalization. Delirium is prevalent in the post-operative population, and prevalence increases with
age. Recent work performed by Dr. Austin and his research team demonstrated that many subjects were
discharged home with active delirium. Patients discharged with active delirium to a nursing facility have worse
outcomes than non-delirious patients. Despite the known negative effects of delirium in the post-acute care
institution population, little is known about the impact of persistent delirium on functional recovery after
discharge to the home setting. Current clinical diagnosis of delirium requires a face-to-face encounter, which
limits the ability to feasibly perform frequent delirium assessments in the post-discharge setting.
Over the past few years, devices that support videoconferencing, such as smart phones, have become
commonplace. Concurrently, interest in telemedicine and remote diagnoses of cognitive disorders has grown.
This interest has become even more acute due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that
currently available videoconferencing capabilities can be easily and quickly utilized to perform reliable delirium
assessments in older adults in the home setting. This project will refine and assess the diagnostic accuracy of
a telemedicine-based delirium assessment tool based on the CAM (the TELE-CAM) that can be utilized in the
home setting and assessed by remote researchers.
We propose a prospective cohort study that will develop and refine this tool as well as demonstrate the
feasibility of conducting in-home delirium assessments (Aim 1). We will also establish the diagnostic accuracy
of our remote delirium assessment tool compared to a reference standard face-to-face assessment (Aim 2).
We will enroll 400 older participants either hospitalized for an acute medical problem or major surgery for this
project. The ability to perform in-home delirium assessments will prove invaluable to researchers investigating
the appropriateness of discharging actively delirious patients’ home versus keeping them in the hospital until
resolution of their delirium. Further, it will provide a method for clinicians to perform quick, remote delirium
assessments of their patients."
10764945,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autistic people are vulnerable to traumatic social experiences such as relational bullying and sexual violence
by peers. Social anxiety and unhappiness with the quality of peer relationships are impairing problems for
many. There are too few social skills interventions for autistic adults that have been tested through randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). This project will test mechanism engagement and feasibility of Healthy Relationships
on the Autism Spectrum (HEARTS). The HEARTS intervention was developed through a NIMH K18 (2020-
2022) and feasibility tested with a sample of N=55 autistic adults ages 18-40 years old from across the US.
HEARTS is a six-session class delivered in real time online. HEARTS is novel because it was developed
through a community-based participatory process with autistic adults, the class sessions are co-delivered by
one autistic and one non-autistic facilitator who work as a team, and the curriculum uses a neurodiversity-
embracing stance instead of a deficit model approach. Specifically, HEARTS does not teach social skills such
as small talk, making eye contact, practice at conversational turn-taking, or other skills that may contribute to
autistic “masking” or camouflaging. Instead, HEARTS draws on evidence-based violence prevention
programming and teaches autistic participants to recognize the differences between healthy and unhealthy
relationships, how to meet people and start new friendships or romantic relationships, how to negotiate sexual
consent, recognize boundaries, and end friendships or dating relationships when needed—while respecting,
rather than seeking to minimize or eliminate, autistic differences. The goal of the proposed clinical trial is to
demonstrate that the target mechanism can be engaged and to pilot all methods (e.g., randomization, facilitator
training) in preparation for a fully powered trial to test HEARTS’ effectiveness. HEARTS is highly scalable in
that it was intentionally created for online delivery. In the HEARTS K18 non-experimental feasibility test,
participation was associated with positive changes in outcomes including social motivation. In the proposed
RCT we will test HEARTS acceptability and participant engagement; fidelity of the facilitators to the original
manual; and provider satisfaction with HEARTS (N=160). We will also test mechanism engagement. We
hypothesize that HEARTS participants will demonstrate significant decreases in hostile automatic thoughts,
decreased rejection sensitivity, and increased social motivation, relative to participating completing the active
control condition (ACC). We will also test clinical impact. We hypothesize that participants who complete
HEARTS will demonstrate statistically significant improvement in satisfaction with quality of peer relationships
(clinical outcome), relative to ACC participants. We will recruit 160 research participants in partnership with the
Asperger/Autism Network (AANE) organization, and benefit from a 5-person autistic Advisory Board.
Consistent with stated priorities in the IACC Strategic Plan for autism research, the proposed research
constitutes a new and innovative approach to promoting wellness and health for autistic adults."
10828342,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a highly effective treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung
cancer, but its accuracy can be compromised by multiple factors. There is an interval between simulation and
the first day of treatment, the size and position of targets and organs at risk can shift over a course of
treatment, and the thorax is in constant multidimensional motion. Adaptive radiation can improve the accuracy
of SBRT, but implementing it within the workflow of a busy radiation oncology clinic currently requires re-
simulation and re-planning, costing valuable departmental time and resources. Cone beam computed
tomography (CBCT) scans are obtained daily prior to the delivery of each fraction, but their utility for adaptive
radiation therapy has been limited by their image quality. Processing time also remains a significant barrier for
real-time deep learning-based methodologies. The objective of our proposed research is therefore to develop,
validate, and test in an early clinical trial the feasibility of using our two-part cone-beam computed tomography-
based deep learning method for dose verification based on rapid and accurate generation of high quality
synthetic CTs and multi-organ segmentation. In this project, we will pursue two Specific Aims: 1) to develop
and refine CBCT-based synthetic CTs for CBCT quality improvement, and 2) to evaluate the clinical feasibility
of our synthetic CT-based dose verification. The early clinical trial will prospectively enroll patients with early-
stage non-small cell lung cancer receiving definitive SBRT. Validation of the feasibility of this method is a
necessary intermediate step towards our longer-term goal of the implementation of real-time lung cancer
adaptive radiation, which will allow for increased accuracy of higher dose to target volumes and lower doses to
organs at risk, thereby improving local control and decreasing radiation-related risks and toxicities for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer."
10772077,"Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles, extending from the surface of vascular endothelial cells to sense
extracellular signaling cues and fluid-shear stress. Cilia dysfunctions (ciliopathies) have been linked to numerous
genetic disorders, and manifest a broad range of symptoms, including hypertension (HTN) and cognitive and
memory dysfunction. We demonstrated that the inability of primary endothelial cilia to sense and transmit fluid
shear stress can lead to nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and cause vascular HTN. HTN can cause brain microvascular
endothelial mechanical stress, damage the neurovascular unit, and ultimately induce cognitive impairment,
contributing to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition, decreased biosynthesis of NO
contributes to CAA in AD patients through increased deposition of beta amyloid (Aβ). However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HTN and AD are incompletely understood thereby limiting our
ability to prevent initiation and progression of this disease. Recent studies have identified specific mAChR-
regulated pathways as novel therapeutic targets for AD. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are also
expressed throughout the cardiovascular system and can regulate BP and NO biosynthesis. However, the
connection between cilia, mAChR signaling, and HTN in the pathogenesis of AD has never been investigated
before. Supported primarily by our recent discovery of the AChM3R localization to primary cilia, we propose a
bold idea to look at the pathophysiological roles of cerebrovascular ciliary receptors in BP and
in AD in vivo. This application is designed to advance the concept that in early stages of AD, diminished cilia-
mediated NO biosynthesis and deposition of endothelium-derived Aβ in cerebral blood vessel wall is an
important mechanism contributing to pathogenesis HTN and AD. We generated vascular-specific AChM3R and
Tg737 KO mice, in which AChM3R and Tg737 (important for ciliogenesis) were specifically deleted from the
vascular endothelia. Interestingly, these mice developed high BP, associated with attenuated NO production, and
altered cognitive function. These studies demonstrated the physiological significance of primary cilia-derived
NO in the long-term control of vascular and cognitive function. In this proposal, we formulated the hypothesis
that endothelial ciliary AChM3R contributes to AD progression through diminished NO biosynthesis. In Aim
1, we will study the effect of AChM3R or cilia deletion from vascular endothelia in 3xTgAD model on Aß
accumulation, vascular reactivity, and brain vascular integrity/function. We will also test the effect of novel
pharmacological modulators on enhancing ciliary AChM3R-mediated NO biosynthesis. In Aim 2, we will
examine the role of cerebrovascular cilia and AChM3R KO in BP and AD manifestations in the 3xTgAD model.
We anticipate that successful completion of this project will offer new opportunities to utilize endothelial
mAChRs as molecular targets for therapeutic interventions designed to prevent detrimental effects of HTN on
cerebrovascular and cognitive function."
10752652,"Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) have high prevalence of mental disorders, however,
they face unique access barriers to mental health services combined with low recognition of mental health
symptoms, leading to low rates of mental health service utilization. The point of transition from
homelessness to housing presents a period of opportunity to identify mental health symptoms and connect
and engage YAEH into mental health services to reduce symptoms and promote housing stability. The
COVID-19 pandemic has heightened mental health symptoms and increased the need for services among
YAEH, but it has also resulted in recovery funds to increase housing supports in many communities.
There is a critical need to develop interventions that can support YAEH with mental health challenges as
they make the transition from homelessness to housing as more supported housing becomes available.
Critical Time Intervention (CTI), a structured, time limited case management intervention has
demonstrated success with adults with serious mental illness in multiple randomized controlled trials but it
has not been tested in YAEH. The goal of this study is to adapt CTI for the context of transition from
homelessness to supported housing within the rapid rehousing program, integrating mental health specific
content from a young adult treatment model, C4, to develop CTI-YAMH (young adult mental health), and
then test the new intervention in a feasibility pilot. Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1: Refine the draft CTI-
YAMH intervention (treatment, training and assessment protocols) to ensure the target mechanisms are
adequately addressed for stabilizing housing and mental health, utilizing an iterative stakeholder feedback
process to finalize the manuals for pilot testing, then Aim 2: Conduct an open trial of the adapted CTI-
YAMH intervention to assess the feasibility of randomization procedures, refine outcome measures,
assess acceptability, and examine the preliminary signal of impact of the intervention. This innovative
study targets a critical point of intervention, the transition from homelessness to housing, for an extremely
marginalized group (YAEH), utilizing an innovative adaptation framework, ADAPT-ITT, to systematically
adapt CTI in partnership with youth with lived expertise and community providers. The CTI-YAMH
intervention aims to support a population with high unmet need for mental health services through a model
that can be paired with rapid rehousing, a supportive housing model widely used in communities across
the U.S. Results from this R34 study lay the foundation for a fully powered RCT of the CTI-YAMH
intervention in a future R01 study."

The ultimate goal in the field of proteomics is single-molecule, high-accuracy, de novo protein sequencing.
Unfortunately, current proteomics technologies are costly, and lack the sensitivity, dynamic range, throughput,
scale, and accuracy needed to meet this goal. During this project, we will begin examining the technological
components and methods required to enable state-of-the-art protein sequencing and characterization. More
specifically, we will develop methods for controllably translocating a protein through a nanopore reader such that
the protein can be sequenced. Nanopore-based sequencing provides a path to characterizing both high- and
low-abundance proteins by sequencing proteins one molecule at a time, but with high accuracy, sensitivity and
throughput needed to cover the wide dynamic range in protein abundance in the proteome. During this project,
we will develop a completely new nanopore-based technology for de novo protein sequencing. We will develop
and build a novel protein sequencing system prototype, fully assess and optimize the associated
workflow/methodology for highly controlled and versatile protein/peptide characterization, and demonstrate initial
sequencing for various proteins and peptides. At the conclusion of this project, we will have successfully
demonstrated feasibility for a practical nanopore-based protein sequencing concept."
10798306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advancing causal implementation theory is critical for designing tailored implementation strategies to facilitate
clinician behavior change that target specific mechanisms associated with evidence-based practice (EBP) use.
Such strategies may be more successful and more efficient than general implementation strategies. The
overall goal of this study is to test the generalizability of a conceptual model that posits the causal relationship
among variables from organizational and social psychology to predict clinician evidence-based practice (EBP)
use. Broadly, the model proposes that organizational factors like climate and culture influence attitudes, norms
and self-efficacy, while other organizational factors like workload, resources and organizational friction
moderate the pathway between intentions and the use of an EBP. Our recently completed NIMH-funded R21
demonstrated that this model accounted for up to 75% of variance in implementation of three EBPs in
community settings. While promising, we were limited by a small sample, and a focus on special education
teachers' use of autism interventions. This R01 will test the generalizability of the causal model in a much
larger sample from a new group of practitioners, for a different and more widely-used EBP, cognitive-
behavioral therapy (CBT). Successful completion would further validate the model, advancing our
understanding of the causal pathways in EBP implementation. We will leverage ongoing CBT implementation
efforts to recruit approximately 300 mental health clinicians across 40 organizations in two large public health
systems (Philadelphia and Texas). After completing training in CBT, clinicians will complete measures of all
constructs delineated in the model. Clinicians also will be observed via audio recording delivering CBT with a
client on their caseload on two occasions. Following each observation, data on theorized moderators of the
intention to behavior gap will be collected via survey. A subset of clinicians who report high intentions and
demonstrate low EBP use will be purposively recruited to complete brief semi-structured interviews further
assessing reasons for the intention to behavior gap. Our primary dependent variables and implementation
outcomes of interest are clinician intentions to use CBT and direct observation of clinician use of CBT.
However, as CBT comprises many discrete components that vary in complexity, each discrete component of
CBT use will be measured separately. Data will be analyzed via multilevel modeling to test the extent to which
intentions and determinants of intention predict each discrete CBT component (Aim 1) and the extent to which
organizational and other contextual factors highlighted in the implementation literature predict factors related to
intention formation and moderate the association between intentions and CBT use (Aim 2). Results will inform
the development of implementation strategies that target modifiable factors explaining substantial variance in
intention and in implementation that can be applied broadly across EBPs."
10795097,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer vaccines are a promising immuno-oncology approach that can elicit highly tumor-specific
responses from the immune system, resulting in prolonged anti-cancer protection. Peptide-based
vaccines are especially attractive because they have low toxicity risk and can be produced easily
at large scale with good storage stability. However, peptide antigens are inherently poorly
immunogenic and susceptible to rapid degradation and excretion after administration. Thus, the
success of peptide-based cancer vaccines are critically tied to their effective formulation and
delivery. The ideal peptide vaccine formulation would replicate each of these critical aspects:
recognition and internalization by dendritic cells, activation of these dendritic cells, and antigen
delivery to both MHC I (called cross-presentation) and MHC II molecules. In this application, we
propose to develop a polymer-based peptide antigen carrier that uniquely addresses all of the
aforementioned delivery needs in a well-controlled, scalable system through the integration of
targeting ligands, controlled release adjuvants, and cytosolic and lysosomal antigen delivery
mechanisms. Our main objectives are to 1) optimize polymer structure and synthesis through
material engineering, 2) assess peptide and adjuvant delivery and characterize in vitro and in vivo
trafficking and delivery, 3) optimize formulations for vaccine efficacy in a murine melanoma model
and 4) evaluate efficacy and safety in a murine breast cancer model for cancer prevention and
therapy. Successful completion of these aims will lead to a formulation poised for GMP
manufacturing and the IND pathway toward clinical testing."
10795788,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Compared to heterosexual women, sexual minority women (i.e., those with same-sex attractions,
same-sex behavior, and/or a lesbian/gay/bisexual identity) are vulnerable to poor gynecological health; for ex-
ample, they are more likely to experience sexual assault and to encounter barriers to care. Yet, despite the
mounting evidence of these gynecological disparities, little is known about the extent to which obstetrical and
perinatal health differ across sexual orientation groups. This gap is especially troubling since sexual minorities
have more risk factors (e.g., depression, substance use, obesity) for adverse obstetrical and perinatal out-
comes compared to heterosexuals. Few data are available to adequately quantify sexual orientation-related
obstetrical and perinatal health disparities, but preliminary results from small, cross-sectional datasets reveal
striking disparities: sexual minority women experience twice the number of pregnancies ending in miscarriage
and stillbirth and twice the number of children born extremely preterm and low birthweight compared to hetero-
sexual women. Quantifying such disparities necessitates the use of large, longitudinal datasets to better inform
interventions. This project's objective is to address the knowledge gaps in sexual orientation-related obstetrical
and perinatal health by collecting and analyzing national data from three unique, longitudinal, intergenerational
cohorts. The Nurses' Health Study 2 (NHS2) began in 1989 when our research group enrolled female nurses
aged 25–42 years (now 56–73 years). In 1996 and 2004, our research group enrolled NHS2 offspring aged 9–
16 years (now 25–39 years) into the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS). These cohorts comprise almost
150,000 participants with nearly as many pregnancies, including >30,000 pregnancies among sexual minori-
ties. The proposed project will leverage existing data—including nuanced sexual orientation data—to identify
new pregnancies among GUTS participants during the height of their reproductive years and collect data about
a third generation: the offspring of GUTS participants. Combining these new and existing data will enable us to
fill critical gaps, for example by detailing outcomes across different generations and sexual orientation sub-
groups (e.g., bisexuals, lesbians). This study will quantify the obstetrical health of sexual minority and hetero-
sexual women as well as the perinatal health of children born to sexual minority and heterosexual women.
Drawing on the Minority Stress Model, the study will also identify mediators and moderators of sexual orienta-
tion-related differences in obstetrical and perinatal health. By collecting detailed, longitudinal data across three
generations with data on obstetrical/perinatal outcomes as well as mediators and moderators, the proposed
research is a substantive, innovative departure from the status quo. This project will produce the first thorough
evaluation of obstetrical and perinatal health of a neglected population—sexual minority women and their off-
spring—and will have a positive impact by revealing the needs of these vulnerable groups, informing targeted
interventions and improving the health of subsequent generations."

Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are disorders of the immune system which are individually rare but collectively
affect 1 in 10,000 individuals. Definitive genetic diagnosis is of essence for timely genetic counseling and clinical
care. Such care may involve bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy or precision pharmacotherapeutics, all
of which can be curative. The recent advancement of genome sequencing in quality and price has led to an
increased rate of discovery of what are now over 400 causal genes underlying IEIs. However, about three
quarters of IEI sequencing yields either variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in one of the 400+ genes or
require discovery of novel causes. This leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment, especially since most of
these VUSs cannot be validated using clinically available assays. As sequencing panels are increasingly utilized
and being covered by insurance, the rate of genetic data production outpaces indiividuals’ capacity to interpret
it. The primary purpose of this proposal is to build a regional resource which would formalize case review
process, match providers and their patients carrying VUSs with research laboratories capable of targeted
functional evaluation and/or bioinformatic assessment, thereby leading to VUS reclassification, diagnosis and
treatment. It also will infuse research enterprises with clinically significant biological questions. We propose to
streamline this process in the NY region by building a 1) patient referral platform and database where
providers will be able to input deidentified patient clinical information alongside the associated genetic data (IEI
gene panels, WES, and WGS sequencing), 2) a multidisciplinary review process where submitted data will
be evaluated by an expert review panel at the forefront of IEI gene discovery and functional validation on a
regular basis who will work to disposition relevant VUSs for 3) functional characterization by a collaborating
expert team followed by 4) result reporting, VUS reclassification and its inclusion in the national clinically relevant
genetic variation database. This multidisciplinary diagnostic NY regional immunology resource is key to
supporting the discovery and functional characterization of novel IEI associated genetic variants. This resource
will serve future, more broadly applied integration of genomics, artificial intelligence/machine learning, rapid
functional assessment and precision medicine."
10823749,"PROJECT SUMMARY ─ OVERALL
Boise State University is an emerging research institution in the Mountain West. In the past 5 years, annual
research awards have increased 58% to more than $65 million. The objective for the proposed COBRE in
Convergent Engineering and Biomolecular Science (CEBS) is to enhance Boise State’s ability to contribute to
solving the nation’s healthcare needs by increasing convergence between engineering and biomolecular
science research. Advancements in healthcare will continue to rely on more evolved and complex devices,
sensors, and integrated systems. The global medical devices market is expected to grow to $603.5 billion by
2023. For this advancement, engineers and biomolecular scientists must collaborate closely and create new
transdisciplinary research areas. Researchers trained in outside disciplines often bring fresh perspectives, new
approaches, and new technologies to the discipline. The overall program aims are to (1) support investigators
in multidisciplinary collaborative research in devices, sensors, and systems; (2) establish an administrative
core to support convergent research; and (3) form a consolidated Fabrication, Characterization, and Testing
(FaCT) core. This COBRE will strengthen the professional development of junior investigators and CEBS
related researchers through training workshops in grant writing and scientific publication. Importantly,
convergent training workshops in the Science of Team Science will be utilized to improve communication
across disciplines to build stronger research teams. Four existing service centers in the College of Engineering
will be consolidated into the FaCT core to reduce redundancy, improve fiscal sustainability, and promote a
biomedical engineering focus. The FaCT core is innovative because it is an engineering-based research core
that is complementary to traditional biomedical research cores. The COBRE will support Pilot Projects and
FaCT core vouchers to stimulate CEBS related research and use of the FaCT core. In summary, the CEBS
COBRE provides a framework to sponsor strong convergent research among engineers and biomolecular
scientists through training workshops, mentoring, networking, and access to a novel engineering core facility."

Collaborative Center in Children’s Environmental Health Research and Translation (CEHRT). It will lead and
organize four thematic Research Working Groups that will fuel work of the Translation and Development Cores
in collaboration with other CEHRTs and the broader CEH research community. The Administrative Core will
also provide centralized management and coordination of all administrative, dissemination, and financial
aspects of the NYU CEHRT. The AC will handle all interactions between NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s
(NYUGSOM’s) Sponsored Programs Administration, its Institutional Review Board, and other research support
institutions at NYU. It will facilitate communication among the core leaders, institutional resources, the broader
CEH community and NIEHS program staff. In addition, the AC will support multidirectional communication
among the NYU CEHRT members and external stakeholders at local, national and international levels to
ensure that translation efforts promote meaningful and consistent exchange and reflect stakeholder
priorities and concerns. The AC will also manage an Internal Advisory Committee and an Independent
Advisory Committee to assist in evaluating the merit, value, and ongoing relevance and importance of
individual organizational elements to accomplish the overall goals of the NYU CEHRT. The Administrative
Core will also centralize evaluation of Center as well as individual pilot projects across the Development and
Translation Cores. It will measure the impact of NYU CEHRT-sponsored pilot project awards on the following
domains: a) influence on the field of children’s environmental health; b) development and sustainability of
transdisciplinary research collaborations; c) investigator development competencies in translational
environmental health research and population science methods; d) productivity as measured in peer-reviewed
and high impact publications and research funding; and e) reach and utility of dissemination products. The
Administrative Core will prepare translation stories and tabulate the aggregate NYU CEHRT effort to support
Independent Advisory Board and Program Office evaluation."
10748302,"PROJECT SUMMARY (DEVELOPMENT CORE)
The goal of the NYU Collaborative Center in Children’s Environmental Health Research and Translation
(CEHRT) Development Core is to stimulate promising research early in the translational phases that generate
preliminary data (T1–T2), and develop and test new interventions, prevention strategies and communication
strategies (T3–T4). The Development Core will launch a “Catalyst Program” to provide catalytic support for
innovative pilots that will generate new and emerging children’s environmental health (CEH) research projects,
facilitate local and national collaborations in CEH, and support mentored investigator development pilot project
and enrichment opportunities for junior scientists at NYU and nationally. The Catalyst Program will center on
nurturing the career development of early stage investigators from across the country through strong
mentorship and interactive, virtual platforms our team has successfully used, especially with junior scientists
from communities underrepresented in health research. The Development Core will also work in tandem with
the Translation Core to prepare promising Development Core Catalyst pilot awardees to further “real-life”
application with additional opportunities for pilot funds and other support from the Translation Core. The Core’s
Specific Aims are to: 1) Stimulate promising and innovative interventions to reduce hazardous exposures in
children from pregnancy, early childhood, and adolescence. 2) Provide tailored mentorship using a spectrum
approach to mentoring for early stage investigators and support pilot project monitoring and progress. 3)
Design and conduct a translation plan to disseminate Catalyst Program pilot study findings and best practices
in investigator development. The Development Core will apply the Reach Effectiveness Adoption
Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to identify best practices to develop investigators and
their research, and support mentees’ capacity to translate research findings into action. Through these efforts,
the Development Core will cultivate a cadre of the next generation of CEH research leaders, trained in
translational research methods that can substantially improve population health. These funds will catalyze
timely and innovative translational research; enabling investigators to both gather preliminary data for larger,
extramurally funded studies and, through mentored experiences, contribute to the research independence of
junior scientists and their understanding of research translation. The Core will also establish reinforcing
mechanisms to support a national peer and senior mentor resource to stimulate translational CEH research,
fostering collaborations across NIEHS networks."
10748305,"PROJECT SUMMARY (TRANSLATION CORE)
While some progress has been made in translating children’s environmental health (CEH) research from basic
research to successful interventions, the pace of uptake and adoption of interventions for widescale impact
remains slow, and few interventions have been adapted for minority populations or low-income settings with
disproportionate exposure. To achieve higher population-wide impact, CEH researchers require training,
mentoring, and collaboration with experts from diverse disciplines to cross the translational bridge and
successfully scale evidence-based interventions for maximum impact. The goal of the NYU CEHRT
Translation Core is to advance research translation and implementation of evidence-based interventions and
policies to prevent and mitigate harms associated with environmental exposures on child development. Our
strategy focuses on providing CEH scientists with opportunities to envision and build out translation agendas
relevant to their CEH research focus, foster new collaborations, obtain pilot funding to support moving their
environmental health research along a translational spectrum as outlined in the NIEHS Translational Research
Framework, and receive ongoing technical support and mentoring. Our broad base of members span
traditional environmental health disciplines of exposure science, toxicology, environmental medicine and
engineering, as well as broader translational fields of community engagement, epidemiology, implementation
science, health economics, health communications and health policy. Together, we have built an extremely
strong track record of moving across the five rings of research described in the NIEHS translational framework.
The Translation Core’s specific aims are to: (1) support new collaborations between CEH researchers,
scientists from other fields, practitioners, and community stakeholders; (2) solicit, review, and select 4 one-year
pilot projects annually; provide continuous mentorship and technical support to pilot program awardees; (3)
disseminate CEH research findings using a repository of translation tools and products (interventions, tools,
methods, messages, etc.) for multiple communication channels and multi-sector use; (4) compare cost-
effectiveness of different interventions to protect children, and quantify health and economic benefits of
reductions in exposure to hazards. Overall, the Translation Core advances environmental health research from
discovery to public health practice by fostering important dialogue and collaborations between multiple
disciplines, as well as building capacity and expertise among CEH researchers in performing multidisciplinary
translational research."

Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized
this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare
information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical
information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites.
We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming
increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart
speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather
information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any
guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio.
The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text
sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to
identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and
style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In
addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed
and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in
listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with
user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine
learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on
discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information
comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using
controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to
generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to
components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at
a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best
practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium.
If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional
method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate
audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily
integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from
working with consumers relevant for clinical practice."

This proposal aims to leverage basic discoveries in interdisciplinary fields to develop a novel and safer therapy
for pandemic type 2 diabetes (T2D). Obesity-linked insulin resistance is the key driving force for T2D and other
metabolic disorders. Despite the wide use of commonly used anti-diabetic drugs for T2D treatment, the
prevalence of T2D continues to soar with an annual cost over $300 billion in the US. The transcription factor
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is an important therapeutic target for insulin
sensitization and its full agonist TZD drugs are by far the most potent insulin-sensitizing drugs. However, TZD
drugs are associated with adverse side effects including heart failure and weight gain, as TZD-induced full
agonism of PPARγ activates not only the expression of genes responsible for insulin sensitizing but also of
those genes associated with side effects, thereby severely hampering the clinical use of TZDs. Recent studies
have indicated that PPARγ posttranslational modifications (PTMs) may lead to the selective activation of
PPARγ target genes that results in the decoupling of the beneficial effects on insulin sensitizing from the TZD-
related adverse effects. Our team recently discovered that deacetylation at K268 and K293 in PPARγ by the
NAD+-dependent deacetylase SirT1 plays a key role in such decoupling. Excitingly, the PIs have developed a
novel class of PPARγ agonist, TPMD, that bound to PPARγ to specifically inhibit PPAR acetylation. Importantly,
TPMD improved insulin sensitivity and increased white-to-brown adipocyte conversion (browning) and energy
expenditure without causing TZD-associated side effects in both genetic and diary obesity mouse models. In this
application, the team led by the two PIs with complementary expertise in diabetes drug discovery and PPARγ
biology will use TPMD as the starting molecule to identify the first-in-class inhibitor of PPARγ acetylation that
exert potent insulin-sensitizing and browning activities and better safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.
In Aim 1, they will employ structure-based design through iterative and parallel medicinal chemistry to identify
TPMD analogs with improved potency of inhibiting PPARγ acetylation. In Aim 2, the lead analogs will be
proceeded to the standardized core in vitro ADMET assays and in vivo pharmacokinetics studies to select those
with the most favorable pharmacological properties. In Aim 3, the lead candidates will be tested rigorously for
their in vivo efficacy and safety in obesity and genetic mouse models. The PIs will adopt their “standardized”
metabolic characterizations and assessments of TZD-associated adverse side effects. The proposed studies will
produce first-in-class PPARγ acetylation inhibitors that have improved insulin-sensitizing potency, safety, and
PK profiles. Thus, completion of this research will be well-poised for further clinical development to curtail the
current epidemics of insulin resistance and T2D."

 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, carries a lifetime risk of 25-33%,
and cost the US healthcare system > 6 Billion dollars a year. Morbidities from AF include congestive heart failure,
dementia, symptoms due to decreased cardiac output, and most importantly an elevated thrombotic stroke risk
due to blood stasis. Recent advances in wearable technology have increased the capacity and accuracy of AF
diagnosis through monitoring heart rate variability in an ambulatory setting. However, there remains no
available ambulatory technologies that permit continuous assessment of the hemodynamic effects of
AF nor measurements of cardiac repolarization that determine the proarrhythmic effects of
antiarrhythmic drugs. Some treatment aspects of AF have remained controversial due to limited efficacy of
rhythm control interventions including cardiac ablation and pharmacologic therapy, both of which have significant
risks. Pharmacologic interventions using Class III antiarrhythmics are especially risky due to the proarrhythmic
effects on ventricular repolarization which can lead to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as
torsades de pointes. As a result of these issues, careful assessment of ventricular repolarization, as represented
by the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), is required during drug initiation. This requires lengthy and
costly inpatient monitoring during drug loading and difficulties in maintaining the narrow therapeutic window after
discharge. Having a reliable method to quantify measures of hemodynamic instability that leads to some AF-
related symptoms, as well as continuously monitoring the QT interval and other clinically important parameters
in an ambulatory setting would allow clinicians to tailor their care to the individual. This proposal aims to refine
a flexible, non-obtrusive wearable system to continuously monitor these key clinical parameters, help in
predicting heart rhythm complications and regulate medication intervention for both rhythm control and
rate control of AF. A sensor suite consisting of a small, wireless and flexible chest-worn patch that measures
both ECG and accelerometer based seismocardiography (SCG) and a wirelessly time synchronized flexible limb
unit capable of monitoring photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals will be used. Aim 1 will quantitatively define the
optimal location for QT interval monitoring on the surface of the chest. Aim 2 will combine the ECG, SCG, and
PPG data streams and extract both unique and time-relational parameters from the signal streams known to be
related to cardiac function and hemodynamics, using machine learning to obtain predictions of hemodynamic
instability from these complex relationships. Aim 3 will address the use and compliance of this wearable system
in a clinical setting against the standard of care during Class III antiarrhythmic drug loading and pharmacologic
cardioversion. The results from this study will provide the first ambulatory measures of AF symptoms and
responses to treatment, informing future studies and clinical care teams of the dominant bioelectrical and
biomechanical parameters that are the most important in the care of the growing, aging population with AF."
10773170,"Project Description
 Patients with congenital cardiac diseases undergoing surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
are at risk for impaired neurodevelopmental progression due to time-related ischemia and exposure to toxic
levels of brain metabolites. Two competing CPB methodologies are currently practiced for certain
commonly occurring cardiac defects: 1) Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest (DHCA), in which the pump is
turned off to provide a bloodless surgical field at the expense of no cerebral perfusion, and 2) Antegrade
Cerebral Perfusion (ACP), whereby selective perfusion of the brain is maintained throughout surgery.
Importantly, DHCA in cardiac surgery is strongly associated with long-term neurocognitive deficits in a
manner proportional to length of the circulatory arrest time. The alternative use of ACP for CPB, designed
as a strategy to protect the cerebral cortex, has become a common approach, though the value of ACP
over DHCA remains hotly debated, with well-designed and objective comparative studies lacking.
 Here we propose preclinical studies of a piglet model using MRI and dynamic proton magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) which measures metabolite activity in real time, to quantify alterations in
the brain’s metabolic state continuously over time during all phases of these CPB strategies. Preliminary
data reveal that DHCA causes marked alterations in brain energy metabolism, (e.g., a > 10-fold buildup in
brain lactate and a reduction in glucose), while no such derangement is seen with ACP. Importantly, post-
surgery quantitative spatial learning assessments will be used to identify metabolic markers most strongly
associated with poor clinical outcomes. Success of this project will demonstrate for the first time the
advantages of ACP over DHCA in preventing brain cellular injury-inducing metabolite derangements that
may hinder normal cognitive development. The real time continuous measurements used in this study will
also provide insights into underlying causes of the correlation between DHCA duration and neurological
injury. Data from these studies are expected to establish a benchmark for safety when DHCA or ACP is
required in the clinical setting. We anticipate that the results of this objective study in the piglet will be
directly and rapidly translatable to clinical practice. The Specific Aims are: 1) Using a CPB piglet model
we will image the brain metabolic state continuously in real time using MRS. The CPB model will
utilize the two commonly used forms of CPB, DHCA and ACP. Both DHCA and ACP will be
performed under varying conditions of temperature, flow and time, to determine the most effective
methodology to preserve a healthy brain metabolic state., and 2) To evaluate neurocognitive
outcomes and correlate with observed alterations in brain metabolism."
10800685,"Project Summary
Gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS) remains a significant clinical problem with no effective treatment. Radiotherapy
and chemotherapy lead to bleeding and cell death resulting in release of hemoglobin and/or free heme.
Accumulating data suggest that free heme stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acts
as a pro-inflammatory danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) through its binding to Toll-Like Receptor 4
(TLR4).
In this study, we will focus on understanding how free heme regulates inflammation through gene regulation
in myeloid or epithelial cells in the gut in the GIS models. Our data indicate there are high numbers of
infiltrating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-positive macrophages (Mø) in colonic biopsies from patients after
radiotherapy versus non-irradiated controls or in the ischemic intestine compared to matched normal tissues.
Further, we showed that myeloid cell-specific deletion of HO-1 resulted in abnormal epithelial cell proliferation
and increased DNA damage (phosphorylated histone H2AX (H2AXg)) in the intestine upon irradiation. We
propose that removal of free heme by the heme scavenger, hemopexin (Hx), and/or by the activity of HO-1 (or
biological products) may be potential therapeutic option for patients with GIS. Our new preliminary data showed
heightened levels of colonic damage and inflammation in Hx-/- mice in response to phenylhydrazine-induced
hemolysis. We also demonstrated that heme affects gene expression through binding to G-quadruplex (G4)
secondary structures in genomic DNA, which are key regulators of genomic stability, transcription and replication.
Our state-of-the-art experimental approaches will allow us to dissect functions of free heme in myeloid and
colonic epithelial cells during treatment-induced inflammation and tissue damage. Moreover, we will assess the
impact of the gut microbiota in the protective effects of HO-1/Hx against GIS. Specifically, in this proposal we
intend to:
1. Characterize the role of free heme in colonic epithelial and myeloid cells in vitro.
2. Determine the role of myeloid cell-expressed HO-1 and heme-regulated gut microbiota diversity in
 the GIS models.
3. Assess the therapeutic potential of recombinant Hx in the GIS models.
4. Characterize the staining of HO-1, Hx, DNA damage and proliferation markers and G4 in biopsies
 from patients with GIS and correlate immunostaining with clinical parameters.
In summary, this study will pursue the definition of a novel role and mechanisms by which free heme acts as a
key player in regulating gene expression upon tissues injury and gut inflammation such as observed in patients
with GIS and/or colitis. This study will not only have high impact on the field of heme biology but will also
contribute to developing much needed treatment strategies for GIS patients."

Up to 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime, with 70-80% of cases
being estrogen receptor positive (ER+). These cancers rely on hormonal signaling, allowing for treatment with
endocrine therapy (ET), including inhibitors of the aromatase enzyme, lowering estrogen levels, or targeting of
the ER itself using modulators and degraders. While these therapies reduce mortality by up to 40%, the disease
often recurs and progresses to metastasis as a result of ET resistance. The main mechanism of resistance is
the acquisition of estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) mutations. These mutations confer constitutive activation to
ER, exhibiting reduced sensitivity to endocrine therapies, and are found in up to 38% of metastases. There is
currently no approved therapy specific to patients harboring these mutations, which should be a clinical priority
given their prevalence in metastatic disease. The Fuqua laboratory has identified distinct transcriptional changes
between primary and metastatic site tumors, and between therapy-resistant ESR1 mutants and wild type ER
cells. In a study of 900 metastatic breast cancer patients, ESR1 mutations were mutually exclusive with other
ER+ breast cancer mutations including Myc and MAPK pathways at the DNA level, but current data in the Fuqua
laboratory and others indicates ESR1 mutations activate these same growth and proliferation pathways at the
transcriptional level. Given the ESR1 mutant’s proclivity for metastasis and therapy-resistance, this proposal’s
central hypothesis is ESR1 mutations generate a transcriptionally reprogrammed phenotype promoting
both metastasis and ET resistance in breast cancer. The rationale for this proposal is that identifying
transcriptional changes in ESR1 metastases and resistant tumors, improves understanding of ESR1 mutant
disease evolution. By targeting transcriptional changes occurring during this evolution, patients can remain on
ET longer and extend metastasis-free survival. To test this central hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims.
Aim 1: What clonal and transcriptional changes accompany metastasis in ESR1 mutant-containing tumors
subjected to ET pressure? This Aim uses computational methods to identify clonal evolution and transcriptional
drivers of metastasis using single cell RNA/DNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Transcriptional drivers will be validated using
FDA-approved inhibitors of these candidates in combination with ET using ex vivo assays. Aim 2: Does ET
enhance the acquisition of ESR1 mutations, promoting subclonal evolution to drive therapy resistance? This Aim
is addressed by developing models with ESR1 mutations acquired during long-term ET and utilizing
computational biology via a combination of single cell DNA-seq and RNA-seq to determine the clonal evolution
and transcriptional driver candidates of ET resistance. Driver candidates will be validated using selective
inhibitors in combination with ET in vitro and in vivo. The results of this proposal will have a positive impact on
the field as they lay the groundwork for mutant-specific therapeutic targets to slow the progression of disease by
prolonging metastasis-free survival and ET sensitivity by enhancing the durability of treatment."

There is a significant unmet medical need to develop pharmacotherapeutics for auditory disorders. Yet, few
academic centers in the world are dedicated to these efforts. With a strong focus on pharmacotherapeutics for
such disorders in the Translational Hearing Center (THC), our Drug Discovery & Delivery Core (DDDC) aims to
establish a state-of-the-art drug development pipeline to facilitate individual research projects in THC. We will
leverage projects developed by Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and allied Center Investigators to significantly
advance the field of pharmacotherapeutics for auditory disorders. Our DDDC will mentor and train the next
generation of hearing researchers and attract new investigators to contribute to this fast advancing field. During
Phase 1, DDDC will: 1) develop in silico, in vitro and in vivo high-throughput screens to discover and validate
novel therapeutics for auditory disorders; 2) establish a medicinal chemistry pipeline to optimize chemical entities
used in research projects or discovered in 1 or in RPLs); 3) establish drug delivery and
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) methodologies; 4) develop a sustainability plan for DDDC services.
With strong commitment from Creighton University and neighboring institutes (Boys Town National Laboratory
and University of Nebraska Medical Center), the DDDC has already established nearly all necessary equipment
and expert personnel. The Director and Co-Directors of DDDC have extensive experience in drug development
for auditory disorders, medicinal chemistry and computational structural studies. The sustained impact of the
DDDC will be to build a state-of-the-art and highly collaborative center so that additional extramural grants and
sponsored programs will gradually cover the main cost of DDDC. We will also emphasize the educational
component so that new investigators will become familiar with this fast-moving field of ototherapeutics and
maintain the momentum for years to come."

Auditory Vestibular Technology Core
 Core facilities are centralized shared research resources that provide access to instruments, technologies,
as well as expert consultation and other services to scientific and clinical investigators. Core facilities are crucial
for competitive multidisciplinary science and have become an integral part of biomedical research. The Auditory-
Vestibular Technology (AVT) Core will be established to provide infrastructure to support Research Project
Leaders and principal investigators associated with the Translational Hearing Center at Creighton University to
conduct multidisciplinary auditory and vestibular research. We will achieve this goal by: 1) Providing state-of-
the-art methodologies and instrumentation to faculty conducting auditory and vestibular studies in animal models.
The AVT Core will provide state-of-the-art technical and scientific support for COBRE-supported translational
auditory and vestibular researchers in the area of auditory and vestibular electrophysiology, molecular biology,
imaging and mass spectrometry. The AVT Core will also provide the infrastructure necessary to capitalize on
emerging technological developments. 2) Mentoring Core users in multidisciplinary research to successfully
compete for research funding. To promote an interdisciplinary scientific environment within the Core itself, and
among investigators in the region generally, the Core is dedicated to an intensive outreach program designed to
encourage inter-investigator communication and introduce junior investigators to interdisciplinary methodologies
available in the AVT Core. 3) Developing a sustainability plan to provide Core services for new and established
investigators beyond COBRE funding. To meet this goal, an active outreach program will be implemented and a
fee-for-service structure will be developed. The AVT Core will play an essential role to the establishment of
multidisciplinary Translational Hearing Center by providing services to research projects that validate
ototherapeutics. The core will also augment the intellectual and scientific atmosphere of the local and Midwest
auditory research community, now and beyond COBRE support."

This proposal outlines a five-year research and career development program aimed at building computational
frameworks for understanding the phenotypic effects of perturbations and somatic alterations in cancer. The
application is heavily based on the candidate’s extensive PhD training in Carnegie Mellon University’s world-
renowned Computer Science Department. It is also grounded in the candidate’s rich prior experience working
as an Associate Computational Biologist at the Broad Institute, and his large network of top-level physicians
and scientists in the cancer field. It also leverages his current postdoctoral appointment under Dr. Gad Getz at
the Broad Institute, and the unique set of resources, facilities, collaborations and expertise in this institute.
Along with a series of relevant didactics and career building activities, these studies will form the basis of his
transition to an independent tenure track position as a scientist guided by the goal of enabling long-term
modeling and understanding of cancer as a disease. The large-scale availability of next-generation sequencing
data for cancer has offered an unprecedented characterization of somatic changes that happen in this disease.
Understanding their combinatorial phenotypic effects is still an open problem, and powerful in vitro perturbation
protocols have been designed to experimentally probe these effects. However, the search space for possible
combinations of perturbations to screen is prohibitively large. The objective of this work is to provide principled
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven methodology for inferring the effects of perturbations and observed somatic
alterations in cancer, a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms. The proposed work draws on recent
development in the technical fields of machine learning and causal discovery. In particular, two Specific Aims
will be evaluated: (Aim 1) inferring causal graphs from single-cell RNA-seq (with the option of pairing it with
whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing); (Aim 2) using a deep generative model, along with paired whole-
exome/whole-genome sequencing, to learn latent underlying factors of variation in single-cell RNA-seq. The
proposed work also includes steps to validate these computational aims. When completed, this work will
advance the field via algorithms/resources that can be used to: (1) use causal knowledge to computationally
select combinations of targets to test in the lab; and (2) computationally infer the effects of somatic DNA
alterations of interest on expression, leading to improved downstream experiment design. Therefore, put
together, the proposed aims are a crucial step in understanding mechanisms in cancer, and will lead to
significant progress towards efficiently discovering drugs for this disease."

ErythroMer (EM) is a novel biosynthetic blood substitute developed to address the critically unmet need for
emergency transfusion in situations where the use of banked red blood cells (RBCs) are either not available or
undesirable. EM is a self-assembled lipid-oligomeric hybrid nanoparticle with a high per particle payload of
hemoglobin (Hb) and the allosteric modifier, RSR13. EM is specifically designed to rectify failures of previous
hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, which do not preserve RBC physiology. The bio-inspired EM design
surmounts previous obstacles by emulating RBC features: long term stability, precise dynamically-responsive
allosteric effector control of Hb oxygen affinity, control of Hb interaction with nitric oxide (NO), preventing
vasospasm, and mitigation of hemoglobin oxidation by containment in the vascular compartment. EM is designed
for sterile lyophilization enabling extended shelf life at ambient conditions and offers cost-effective production at
scale. KaloCyte has developed a pragmatic yet robust step-wise goal oriented development plan for
commercialization including meticulous evaluation of preclinical safety to support FIH dosing. A systematic and
rigorous in vitro, ex vivo and animal model based pre-clinical proof-of-concept strategy provides strong evidence
supporting the premise for and feasibility of this proposal. Further, our commitment to characterize a
comprehensive non-GLP pharmacokinetic and exploratory toxicology as well as an FDA vetted GLP toxicology
plan for EM is elucidated. To meet these milestones in a timely fashion, non-GLP dose dependent
pharmacokinetic studies of EM that probe tissue distribution, metabolism, and elimination and exploratory
toxicology studies will be conducted. Successful completion of these experimental studies will inform on
pharmacokinetic behavior, potential dose dependent safety signals and product quantity needs, moving forward
into GLP toxicology studies and eventually FIH dosing. The described, comprehensive dose dependent
toxicology studies are tailored to meet FDA expectations that allows for dosing of EM in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
This process requires, escalating single dose toxicology study in rabbits expanded to 14 days for post dose
recovery. Parallel studies investigating cardiac electrophysiology, pulmonary hemodynamics, and systemic
hemodynamics in a dog safety pharmacology study with an added toxicokinetic arm. Completion of these IND-
enabling studies provides necessary pre-clinical animal data qualifying KaloCyte to submit an IND package for
EM. EM has the capability to dramatically transform care in situations where the adverse effects of stored RBCs
exceed benefit and may enable novel efficacies. However, the most compelling use will be in settings where
stored RBCs are unavailable or undesirable.

 This project aims to generate super-resolution time-resolved phase-contrast MRI (4D flow MRI) for improved
quantification of cerebral hemodynamics. Our team has collected extensive in vivo 4D Flow data in several other
funded projects. That data was processed with conventional manual methods and was limited by the relatively
modest acquisition resolution. We have data of three levels of complexity. The first is extremely high-quality data
in very carefully controlled flow models created with patient-specific geometries and flow conditions. Second, is
in vivo data from the intracranial venous outflow tract, collected from 58 patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT). In
these territories, the flow has relatively little pulsatility but is geometrically complex with pronounced vorticity.
Finally, we have 4D Flow data from 148 patients with intracranial aneurysms (IA). Using these existing datasets,
we propose an incremental progression to develop advanced methods for improving 4D flow resolution.
 There is compelling evidence that hemodynamic parameters are of major importance in determining the
evolution of vascular disease progression, and response to therapy. In principle, 4D Flow MRI can be used to
determine the velocity field in three-dimensions and through the cardiac cycle. However, using acceptable
acquisition times, the resolution is insufficient for reliable velocity mapping given the small caliber of the
intracranial vessels. Patient-specific computational and experimental models can provide superior resolution, but
their accuracy depends on modeling simplifications and assumptions. We propose to address the current
limitations of 4D flow images by developing a deep learning based, super-resolution approach. In this approach,
the flow in cerebral vessels will be imaged with 4D Flow MRI and simulated with patient-specific Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
 In this study, we will first generate 3D CFD simulation of hemodynamics in patient-specific data. Then, we will
develop a super-resolution neural network using CFD data to provide higher resolution 4D flow data. Successful
accomplishment of this project will provide an evaluation tool that is validated for improved quantification of
cerebral hemodynamics. A tool such as this could be used to stage interventional treatments and improve patient
outcomes, in direct support of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute mission."
10772039,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer related mortality in the United States. Despite advances in
surgical approaches and treatment regimens, overall survival has improved only marginally over the past thirty
years. Although nearly 80% of ovarian cancer patients will achieve complete clinical remission through surgery
and systemic therapy at their initial diagnosis, more than 50% will experience a recurrence by five years after
diagnosis. However, little is known about factors contributing to risk of ovarian cancer recurrence. Ovarian
cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct histotypes that inform prognosis. High grade serous carcinoma
is the most common histotype, comprising ~70% of all ovarian cancer diagnoses. Recently, three robust gene
expression signatures have been developed that have the potential to inform patient prognosis and biomarker-
driven therapeutic approaches. These tumor gene expression signatures include: a) the Milstein prognostic
score that distinguishes individuals with high and low probability of survival; b) the PrOTYPE classifier, which
categorizes four biologic subtypes; and c) the Oxford classifier, which identifies a poor prognosis epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition score. Each signature correlates to differential with survival, suggesting that the
signatures may have clinical utility in informing patient prognosis; however, the scores have yet to be evaluated
in a population-based setting. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to understand patient
demographic, clinicopathologic, and molecular features associated with patterns of ovarian cancer recurrence
and mortality. To do this, I will leverage the robust resources through the Utah Population Database to achieve
the following study aims: (1) Characterize patterns of ovarian recurrence and mortality by patient and
clinicopathologic characteristics; and (2) Compare the performance of three prognostic tumor gene expression
signatures with (a) mortality and (b) recurrence among high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. The primary
training experience will focus on three areas: first, to develop expertise in the development and validation of an
algorithm to identify recurrence using multiple data streams; second, to develop expertise in transcriptomics
and data analysis pipelines for gene expression profiling; and third, to foster professional and career
development through leadership, scientific communication, and then transitioning to independence. The
research and training will be supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship team led by Dr. Jennifer Doherty,
and comprised of experts in ovarian cancer and genetic epidemiology, computational biology, and biostatistics.
The results from these aims will expand our understanding of factors contributing to risk and timing of ovarian
cancer recurrence and provide evidence on how gene expression signatures of high-grade serous ovarian
cancer can be incorporated into clinical risk assessment. Cumulatively, information gleaned from this work
could lead to a personalized approach to ovarian cancer disease management through inclusion of prognostic
markers in clinical care and the development of biomarker-driven therapies."

 4 report (CFFPR) demonstrated a near-doubling of pregnancies in people with CF from 310 in 2019 to 619 in 2020.
 5 Greater understanding of the health impacts of parenthood is critical to inform reproductive decisions and provide
 6 effective interventions for those with CF who decide to become parents.
 7 This co-funded application with the National Institutes of Health and the CF Foundation (CFF) will seek
 8 to determine the health impact of parenthood on men and women with CF in the era of CFTR modulators. To
 9 provide relatively immediate evidence on parenthood’s effect on pulmonary health and the influence of the intro-
10 duction and use of all available CFTR modulators, in Aim 1 we will assess changes in pre- vs. intra-parenthood
11 percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) in a retrospective longitudinal cohort study
12 linking CFFPR data with cross-sectional surveys collected from 249 new parents attending participating US CF
13 centers between 2011-2020. We will identify predictors and timing of lung function loss using 747 non-parents
14 from participating centers as a comparison group and examine the impact of CFTR modulators on parental
15 health. In Aim 2, we will prospectively collect physical and mental health data to comprehensively evaluate the
16 impact of parenthood in CF with widespread highly effective CFTR modulator use. We will follow 146 new parents
17 of children <5 years of age over 5 years to assess the primary outcome of ppFEV1 change. To model potential
18 confounding/effect modification on the association between parenthood and outcomes, we will combine objective
19 physical health data and survey assessments of mental health, parental responsibility/stress, quality of life, and
20 adherence. We will conduct dyadic interviews with a subset of parents and their key supports to explore the
21 parenthood experience and identify future interventions. This study of the CF population would be the first, large-
22 scale epidemiologic data collection of how becoming a parent interplays with having a chronic disease.
23 Dr. Kazmerski, the principal investigator, is a pulmonologist and health services researcher with exper-
24 tise in sexual and reproductive healthcare for people with pediatric-onset chronic disease. The results of this
25 long-term, observational study will determine whether parenthood adversely impacts the health of people with
26 CF and the ability of CFTR modulators to mitigate such effects. Healthcare providers can use the data to pro-
27 vide evidence-based guidance to help those with CF make informed parenthood decisions. Future interven-
28 tions targeted to identified modifiable risk factors and high-risk time periods can be developed and tested to
29 prevent poor parental health outcomes. This work is aligned with the missions of the National Heart, Lung, and
30 Blood Institute and CFF as it improves the comprehensive care and quality of life for people with CF."

10817887,"PROJECT SUMMARY – MORPHOLOGY CORE
The Morphology Core Facility provides instrumentation and technical expertise for the preparation, acquisition
and analysis of images of cells and tissues at both the light and electron microscopic level. Given the cost of
such instrumentation and the high level of technical expertise required to perform these investigational
techniques, this Core was established to ensure the availability of these techniques for Center members. In
recognition of the broad usefulness of this Core facility, the School of Medicine has partnered with the Liver
Center by making ongoing, major investments to ensure that the facility remains state-of-the-art. The
Morphology Core offers the following specific activities and services, plus associated training and technical
support: (1) confocal microscopy, (2) multiphoton microscopy, (3) super-resolution microscopy, (4) swept field
microscopy, (5) light sheet microscopy, (6) electron microscopy, (7) image analysis, and (8) other microscopy
tools, including widefield and brightfield microscopy and cryo-sectioning. More than two-thirds of the members
of the Liver Center used this core facility and the core was used in over one hundred forty publications during
the current award period, reflecting the continued usefulness and importance of this resource for the mission of
the Center."
10817890,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CELLULAR MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY CORE
The Cellular and Molecular Physiology Core is the “work horse” of this Center, but it also continues to serve as
an innovation hub to provide liver investigators with the most up-to-date experimental models. The core is
organized to provide technical expertise, equipment and personnel to Liver Center Investigators in order to
provide them with state of the art cell and molecular research resources in an efficient, quality-controlled and
cost-effective manner. The Core has a long history of developing new cell and animal models for liver research.
Currently, the Core is divided into two Components: (1) The Cell Isolation and Cell Culture Component and (2)
The Molecular Component. These are subdivided into: (a) Isolated cell preparations, including: hepatocytes,
cholangiocytes, endothelial cells, stellate cells, portal fibroblasts and hepatic lymphocytes, primarily from mice
and rats. Human hepatocytes are also utilized when available. Over 3,400 separate cell isolations were
performed during the current award period; (b) Cell culture facilities for short and long-term cultures and cell
lines; (c) Protein and gene expression using Quantitative RT-PCR and Infrared imaging detection; (d) Altering
gene expression in liver-related cells, cell lines and tissues using siRNA transfection, adenovirus infection, and
CRISPR technologies; (e) providing a variety of animal models of liver disease and (f) disease-specific mouse
and human liver organoids, derived from iPSC’s, bile, and primary liver tissue. By centralizing these procedures
in a Core facility, cost and effort are dramatically reduced, investigators are assured of a high degree of rigor,
reproducibility, and quality control, and preparations can often be used simultaneously by more than one
investigator. Mario Strazzabosco, MD, PhD, who has more than 25 years of relevant experience, directs this
core with the collaboration of the Emeritus Director, James L. Boyer, MD, who has more than 4 decades of
experience working with these preparations and procedures. They are assisted by Romina Fiorotto, PhD, and
Shi-Ying Cai, PhD, which assures daily supervision, availability, and advice to investigators for many of these
services."

 Caring for the critically ill accounts for 5-10% of all U.S. healthcare spending, while in-hospital mortality
remains high (20-40%). Yet, there are currently no effective therapeutic interventions beyond supportive care
and antibiotics. The development of new therapeutic strategies requires filling important gaps in our knowledge
of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction in the critically ill. Hemorrhagic shock
induces a systemic response that results in immune dysfunction, rendering the host susceptible to severe
secondary infections that are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital ICUs. The focus of the
research program outlined in this MIRA renewal is in understanding how hemorrhagic shock alters the
response of neutrophils, the essential mediators of acute host defense against bacteria/fungi. When
dysregulated, neutrophils prematurely deploy their antimicrobial arsenal of cytotoxic proteases and reactive
oxidants, directly injuring host tissue. Following hemorrhagic shock, neutrophils become “primed” and
subsequently induce acute lung injury, coupled with a significant deficit in their capacity to find and fight
infection. Our long-term goals are to understand the mechanisms of neutrophil dysfunction that occurs as a
result of hemorrhagic shock and to identify targets for correcting aberrant neutrophil function. Our studies will
interrogate three aspects of the neutrophil response: priming, trafficking, and antimicrobial function. We have
established an innovative approach for the rapid generation of neutrophil-specific chimeric mice by
transplantation of conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitor cell lines. Importantly, this technique does
not require animal irradiation and yields robust chimerism of donor-derived neutrophils (>40%) that are
functionally equivalent to endogenous neutrophils. This system is genetically tractable, enabling in vivo studies
into the mechanistic aspects of neutrophil dysfunction following hemorrhagic shock. In Project 1, we will
continue using our clinically relevant “two-hit” mouse model of critical illness through hemorrhagic shock and
secondary respiratory infection. We will determine the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of specific
subset of neutrophil effector functions (e.g., reactive oxidant generation, degranulation) in response to
hemorrhagic shock, evaluating the role of novel genes in acute lung injury and bacterial clearance. In Project 2,
we will employ our microfluidic platform to investigate the mechanisms of neutrophil sequestration in model
pulmonary capillaries. As the lungs are particularly susceptible to neutrophil-mediated injury, this model
provides a means to evaluate new strategies for modulating aberrant neutrophil trafficking that contributes to
acute lung injury. In Project 3, we will pursue several targets for enhancing the antimicrobial function of
neutrophils without exacerbating injury to host tissue, focusing on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Together, these integrated approaches will address major knowledge gaps in neutrophil pathobiology by
spanning the molecular, cellular, and organism/disease levels of experimentation."
10768562,"Agencies that fund medical research are under increasing pressure to translate funded research
projects to commercial entities. These commercial entities can obtain the necessary external capital
needed to advance the technology to a point where it will change health care. The VA is no different in
encountering these problems as a funding agency, and the problems are compounded by the VA's
unique mission to address the health care needs of Veterans. But this translational research process is
long, complicated, and expensive. Further, translational researchers are not trained in the skills
needed to identify and address these challenges. Finally, these problems are typically faced only after
significant research progress has been made, meaning that any required changes require costly delays
for revisions or new studies. The VA has made tangible progress in advancing translational research,
but now needs a way to embed the knowledge required for efficient technology transfer in the culture of
VA researchers to increase efficiency, improve quality, and have a greater effect on the health care of
Veterans. To accomplish this, the VA Translational Education and Mentoring (VA-TEAM) Center
proposes a two-phase approach to educate VA's translational research community and identify VA's
most promising translational research projects for experienced project management, advising, and
mentoring. The long-term objective is to create a lasting culture of translational focus for the VA
research network. When investigators are taught about the translational pathway from beginning to
end, it changes how they think about their research and their role in the translational ecosystem. With
this knowledge, they change how they approach all aspects of the research endeavor, from funding
sources, grant writing, hiring students and staff, approaching mentors, and even the conferences where
they choose to present their work. Underlying these changes is an understanding of the fundamental
necessity of all successful translational work: developing a valuable solution to a robust clinical need.
The immediate objective is to identify the VA's most promising research technologies across all four
research services, and provide them with focused expertise to identify the critical work remaining to
make their projects attractive for investment. To realize these objectives, VA-TEAM brings two things
to the VA: first, a soup-to-nuts online curriculum through a series of existing modules and workshops.
These modules walk research teams through the fundamentals of translational research from finding
product-market fit to financing, all within the context of their own research projects, and with special
emphasis on Veteran health and VA's strategic priorities. The second piece is an advanced, more
intensive program designed to drive selected late-stage translational research to the point where it is
attractive for outside investment. This is done through active project management and regular
meetings with business advisors. The advisors also teach the teams in-depth lectures to increase the
understanding gained in the first phase. VA-TEAM Center programming will advance VA's translational
research more quickly and efficiently through the translational process, ultimately leading to increased
license activity and impact on Veteran health."
10906738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of children receive general anesthetics (GAs) for surgical procedures. Emerging evidence from human
epidemiologic and animal studies suggest that short acting general anesthetic drugs can cause acute brain
injury, leading to long-term cognitive defects and behavioral problems. In 2016, the US Food and Drug
Administration issued a warning about the potential neurotoxic effects of GA exposure in children under age
three. As GA use is necessary for many surgeries, avoidance is often impossible. Thus, understanding how
anesthetics induce neurotoxicity is of critical importance in public health, especially so that effective
neuroprotective strategies can be developed. One promising area of investigation is mitochondria -- as
neurons have high energy requirements, they are especially vulnerable to injury and death from dysfunctional
mitochondria. However, despite the extensive research of anesthetic-induced developmental neurotoxicity
(AIDN) done during the last decades, mechanisms by which mitochondrial impairment leads to neuronal
signaling deregulation and cell death remain unclear. Causative relationship between mitochondrial injury and
anesthetic-induced long-term behavioral abnormalities has not been explored. To address the aforementioned
gap, in our preliminary studies we investigated and found that anesthetics were toxic to mitochondria in
developing mouse and human brain cells. Our data also suggest the regulative function of dysregulated non-
coding RNAs in anesthetic-induced impaired mitochondrial function. Thus, the overarching goal of this program
is to continue to fill the gap of mitochondrial knowledge in anesthetic nontoxicity by investigating the functions
and novel regulatory molecular mechanisms of mitochondria in AIDN as well as developing neuroprotective
approaches targeting mitochondria. Extending upon our lab's recent research and preliminary findings, our
proposed program will focus on the following three independent research areas: 1) Determine functions and
brain cell type-specific mechanisms of mitochondrial signaling in anesthetic-induced cognitive dysfunction and
abnormal behaviors. 2) Delineate novel posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms by which mitochondrial
signaling and functions are regulated in AIDN. 3) Investigate neuroprotective effect of small molecules in AIDN.
We will conduct these investigations using both transgenic mouse models and similar human induced
pluripotent stem cell models obtained via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Furthermore, this program will use
innovative, cutting-edge experimental neuroscience tools, unbiased multi-omic approaches (e.g., gene gain-
and loss-of function, multiphoton real time imaging, single-cell RNA sequencing, and high-throughput analysis
of neuronal activities). The proposed studies will facilitate a better understanding of GA-driven mitochondrial
dysfunction, which may lead to effective therapeutics for preventing AIDN in young children."
10768559,"Project Abstract
 Sleep is essential for brain health, and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with substantial
sleep disruptions. Disrupted sleep is now thought to not just be a symptom of neurodegeneration, but
potentially to also contribute to the onset of the disease. Notably, Alzheimer’s disease pathology is associated
with loss of EEG slow waves during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep is thought to be important
for clearance of proteins such as amyloid-beta and tau from the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and
the human brain exhibits waves of CSF flow during NREM sleep, suggesting that CSF flow during sleep may
play a role in its effects on brain health. This proposal aims to understand the link between neural slow waves
during sleep and CSF flow in healthy aging and in individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. We hypothesize
that neural activity can induce CSF flow through its effects on cerebral blood volume. We in turn predict that
loss of neural slow waves during sleep in the aging brain may lead to loss of sleep-dependent CSF flow, and
that this decline is associated with Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk factors. To test our hypothesis, we will use
multimodal imaging to simultaneously measure neural activity, hemodynamics, and CSF flow. We will test the
link between neural activity and CSF flow, and will identify whether the decline in sleep slow waves in older
adults is associated with less CSF flow. We will further examine whether this process is more severely
disrupted in healthy older adults with genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Together, these studies will establish
a biological mechanism for how altered sleep in aging leads to altered fluid flow dynamics, and this knowledge
will form an essential foundation for the development of future biomarkers and interventions to evaluate and
modulate CSF flow in the aging brain."
10766691,"Morphogenesis of the inner ear epithelium requires coordinated deployment of several signaling pathways and
disruptions cause abnormalities of hearing and/or balance. With the advent of cochlear implantation to treat
hearing loss even in cases of inner ear malformation, it is critical to understand exactly how such malformations
affect the auditory ganglia and innervation. Also, in light of the intense focus on in vitro generation of inner ear
cell types for transplantation and in vivo manipulation of developmental signaling molecules to promote
differentiation of various inner ear cells for hearing restoration, elucidating the roles and regulation of such
signals and their effectors governing otic differentiation and morphogenesis are necessary to advance treatment.
 The genes encoding FGF3 and FGF10, ligands that signal through FGFR2b and FGFR1b, are expressed
dynamically throughout otic development in both epithelial and ganglion domains. Studies conducted by the
Mansour Lab of both conventional Fgf3 and Fgf10 conditional knockout mice and those expressing a
doxycycline-inducible ligand trap (dnFGFR2b) that rapidly inhibits signaling through both FGFR1b and
FGFR2b, showed that Fgf3 and Fgf10 are not required in the placode lineage for otocyst formation, but are
required subsequently for otocyst patterning, neuroblast maintenance, epithelial proliferation and both
vestibular and cochlear morphogenesis. Furthermore, the first genome wide analyses of otocyst mRNA revealed
FGFR2b/1b signaling targets that define novel candidates for genes involved in otic morphogenesis and function.
 This proposal has two Aims addressing the hypotheses that 1) FGFR2b/1b signaling is required continuously
for both otic neuroblast specification and maintenance, and that at later stages, mesenchymal signaling, as well
as that in the epithelial and ganglion domains, is required for cochlear epithelial differentiation and ganglion
maintenance and 2) FGFR2b/1b downstream target genes mediate some or all of the effects of FGFR2b/1b
signaling on otic morphogenesis and gangliogenesis. To determine the early role of FGFR2b/1b signaling in otic
ganglion formation and its later role in epithelial differentiation and ganglion maintenance, DOX-induced
ubiquitous and CRE-limited expression of dnFGFR2b will be employed and morphology and molecular markers
of otic patterning, proliferation and survival in both tissues will be assessed. To determine the roles of
downstream targets of FGFR2b/1b signaling, two genes encoding transcription factors that are activated by
FGFR2b/1b signaling and one gene encoding a BMP signaling regulator that is repressed by FGFR2b/1b
signaling will be studied. Otic conditional mutants will be generated for each gene, and their morphologic and
functional development will be assessed. In addition, the extent to which the BMP regulator contributes to the
dnFGFR2b phenotypes and the effects of overexpressing the BMP regulator will be assessed.
 The results will contribute new knowledge that will facilitate future efforts to manipulate the FGF signaling
system for hearing restoration."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an obesity-associated liver disease that affects an
estimated 7 million children in the United States. It is the most common reason for liver
transplantation in adults and increases long term risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
NAFLD disproportionately affects Hispanic children and is an exceptionally important health
disparity. The proposed studies will address prevention of NAFLD in children because current
treatments are only partially effective, and no cure exists for the disease. A unique physiologic
opportunity exists in children in that NAFLD appears to have a narrow time of onset in children,
during early puberty. In a recently completed randomized clinical diet provision trial comparing
a very low free sugar diet to usual care, we demonstrated improved hepatic steatosis, liver
inflammation and rate of de novo lipogenesis in children who already have NAFLD. However, it
is unknown if providing a low free sugar diet (LFSD) in pre-pubertal children can help prevent
hepatic steatosis and NAFLD onset as they age into puberty. The central study supporting the 3
aims is a 1 year randomized prevention trial with a 1 year follow-up observational study in children
who are pre-pubertal at baseline and who are known to be in a high-risk group for developing
NAFLD because of Hispanic ethnicity and a first degree relative with NAFLD or type 2 diabetes.
The intervention will replace typical drinks and food high in (non-dairy) sugars with low or no
sugar foods using our established methods including 1) provision of food for the entire family 2)
facilitated grocery shopping 3) home visits 4) behavior change counseling and, 5) frequent
monitoring. Hispanic children age 7-9 years, Tanner stage 1, who are at high risk of NAFLD by
family history will be randomized to LFSD intervention or usual care with matching for contact
hours. The primary outcome is hepatic steatosis by MRI-PDFF at 1 year. Aim 1 tests whether the
intervention protects against increase in hepatic steatosis at 1 year and NAFLD onset at 2 years.
Aim 2 tests gene variants associated with NAFLD, baseline anthropometrics and insulin
sensitivity modifiers of the impact of LFSD on change in hepatic steatosis at 1 year. Aim 3 explores
biochemical and lipid metabolism mechanisms underlying hepatic steatosis and LFSD. In
summary, this trial will generate evidence regarding the potential for using free sugar restriction
as a NAFLD prevention strategy for children at increased risk of NAFLD. The findings will have
sustained and significant implications for health promotion in Hispanic children, reduce health
disparities, and inform future prevention efforts for children at increased risk of NAFLD."

MesoAmerican Nephropathy (MeN) is a leading cause of death in Central America, resulting in more than
20,000 deaths in the last 20 years. Despite a decade of research on risk factors, including heat and
subsequent dehydration, infectious diseases, chemical exposures, medications and diet, the causes of this
devastating disease remain unclear. The majority of affected individuals are young men working in agricultural
industries, notably sugarcane. Unlike chronic kidney disease (CKD) in other parts of the world, MeN is
characterized by early onset, with patients diagnosed in the 20s or younger. Our Boston University research
team, which has led MeN research in Central America since 2009, has identified evidence of kidney injury and
renal function decline among youth in the region, including elevated prevalence of low eGFR and evidence of
hyperfiltration and urinary biomarkers of kidney injury, both of which may indicate early kidney disease. Our
preliminary data leads us to hypothesize that early life, nephrotoxic exposures contribute to kidney injury and
renal function decline, and that these exposures increase susceptibility to MeN following occupational
exposures later in life. In 2016 (baseline), our team recruited and enrolled over 800 youth in Nicaragua, ages
7-18 years, to set the foundation for a longitudinal cohort of children, adolescents and young adults (the
“NIÑOS” cohort). In this R01, we propose to initiate follow up with these youth, who will be 12-28 years of age
at the start of the study, for a 36-month period. The goals of this study are to: 1) characterize renal function
during youth and young adulthood (annualized change in eGFR) in Nicaragua, a region of high-risk for MeN; 2)
use high-throughput proteomic analysis, including >180 proteins, to develop a predictive biomarker of elevated
annualized decline in eGFR over time; 3) establish the association between a broad spectrum of chemicals
and heavy metals with annualized change in eGFR, using standard and “mixtures” analytic techniques; 4)
conduct a multichemical exposome analysis, including >1500 chemicals, using silicone wristbands to broadly
evaluate the association between personal chemical exposure and renal function; and 4) assess the
association between exposure to heat and renal function in youth using personal heat exposure monitoring.
This project would provide the most comprehensive account to date of renal function and environmental
exposures among a population at high risk of MeN before disease onset, providing critically important etiologic
inferences. Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin is a global public health crisis, with concurrent epidemics
in Sri Lanka, Egypt, and India, as well as throughout Central America. This study will inform international
efforts to understand this phenomenon and reduce incidence."
10767771,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 15% of adults in the United
States, over 30 million Americans have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Podocytes are epithelial cells in the
glomerulus whose major function is the maintenance of the kidney filtration barrier to prevent CKD.
Furthermore, the prevalence of CKD in the Veteran population is a third higher than in the general population.
Podocyte injury is implicated in diseases such as Focal Segmental Glomerular Sclerosis (FSGS). In these
diseases, the podocyte loses characteristic morphologic features and the functional capacity to maintain the
glomerular filtration barrier. In several recent studies, we reported the essential role of Krüppel-Like Factor 15
(KLF15), a kidney-enriched transcription factor, in maintaining podocyte actin cytoskeleton under cell stress.
For instance, loss of function studies in preclinical proteinuric murine models demonstrated that KLF15 is
required to prevent podocyte injury and the salutary benefits of glucocorticoids (GCs), the most common
treatment for primary glomerulopathies, are mediated by KLF15. As well, the responsiveness to GCs in human
primary glomerulopathies is associated with podocyte-specific expression of KLF15. Furthermore, induction of
human KLF15 in podocytes attenuated kidney injury in proteinuric murine models, without the adverse
sequelae of GCs. Collectively, these preclinical and clinical studies on the renoprotective effects of KLF15
induction motivated us to identify novel small molecule KLF15 agonists for kidney disease.
 We initially generated and conducted a cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) to screen small
molecules that induce KLF15 activity. Subsequent dose-escalating studies identified novel lead compounds
with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50), in the optimal therapeutic window, required to induce KLF15
activity. Based on EC50 and druggability, we conducted Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) on the lead
compound K-7 and generated 16 lead analogues, of which BT501, BT502, BT503, BT514, and BT412 induced
KLF15 promoter activity with or without cell stress. We also performed intial pharmacokinetic studies for K-7 in
mice and also showed that human podocytes treated with K-7 and lead analogues attenuated podocyte injury
in the setting of cell stress. Furthemore, RNA-seq of K-7 treated human podocytes shows inhibition of pathway
IL-17RA-mediated actin cytoskeleton destabilization, thereby providing the rationale to utilize a mechanistic
approach to optimize selectivity of KLF15 agonists. Finally, we observed that K-7 attenuated albuminuria and
restored podocyte markers in a preclinical proteinuric murine model. Based on these compelling preliminary
data and strong scientific rigor of prior research, we hypothesize that optimization of lead KLF15 agonists in
preclinical studies will serve as a key therapeutic in proteinuric kidney diseases. We propose to test our
hypothesis by (1) improving the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of lead KLF15 agonists, (2)
utilizing a mechanistic approach to optimize selectivity of KLF15 agonists, and (3) testing the therapeutic role
of lead KLF15 agonists in mitigating and/or reversing kidney injury in preclinical proteinuric models.
 This proposal will address a current gap in the field by developing an integrated framework to optimize
lead novel KLF15 agonists and test their therapeutic role in preclinical proteinuric models. The long-term goal
of our project is to identify the optimal KLF15 agonist that can be advanced for IND studies for the treatment of
primary glomerulopathies. Identification of novel targets for the treatment of proteinuric diseases is of major
interest to the VA, given the high burden of CKD among U.S. Veterans. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies
that mitigate the long-term use of GCs will have a tremendous impact on the complications associated with
GCs in U.S. Veterans. Finally, the therapeutic role of KLF15 induction might extend beyond kidney disease, as
other laboratories have demonstrated the beneficial effects of KLF15 in cardiac hypertrophy,
neurodegenerative disease, and adipogenesis."
10754959,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 The propagation of tau pathology along synaptically connected brain circuits is considered a
major driver of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying
proteopathic tau seed entry and amplification within human neurons remain unclear. Given the putative
role of brain circuits in tau propagation, axons/axon terminals or dendrites may be involved in tau seed
uptake. However, this has never been determined in neuronal models, and typical methods to study
these events, such as light microscopy and immunofluorescence alone, have critical resolution limits.
Thus, we cannot yet hypothesize where in a neuron that the tau seeds access the cytoplasm and
replicate. To answer these questions, we will apply high-resolution correlative light and electron
microscopic imaging (3D-CLEM), combined with advanced cell-based fluorescent biosensors and novel
conformational antibodies with live cell imaging in human neurons derived from inducible pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) available here in our center. Our strategy should enable determining where tau seed
uptake occurs, and the localization and sub-cellular components and/or molecular machinery involved
in tau seed amplification, while bypassing protein aggregate extraction techniques that introduce
experimental artifact. By exploring these mechanisms using high-resolution correlative imaging within
human neurons, we will address how proteopathic seeds access the cytoplasm and replicate, which
may have broader implications for other related neurodegenerative diseases."
10804709,"Project Summary
It is crucial to understand how infants learn to progress from spontaneous movements into goal-directed, refined
motor skills. Infant learning is the focus of early intervention programs, and the need for effective early
intervention is great. Until we understand the mechanisms of development and what promotes or inhibits
successful infant learning, we cannot design optimal early intervention. Our specific objective is to longitudinally
study infant experience (infant and environmental factors) and underlying neural substrates
(electroencephalography (EEG)) as infants learn arm reaching, an early, foundational motor skill.
Current theories suggest that infants learn through a repeated perception-action process and that experiencing
error is the key mechanism for successful infant learning. Thus, Aim 1 will measure error rate longitudinally
across the emergence and refinement of reaching. In Aim 1 we will determine the relationship between error rate
and the development of reaching skill. We hypothesize that infants will demonstrate a high error rate
(errors/attempts) near reaching onset that decreases as they refine the skill, supporting the idea that making
errors is a key experience in order for learning to occur. Aim 2 will focus on individual infant and environmental
factors that predict age of onset of reaching. In Aim 2 we will identify infant and environmental factors related to
the age of reaching onset. Infant factors are motor experience (amount and type (unilateral or bilateral) of daily
arm movement experience) and cognitive development status. Environmental factors are level of maternal
education, quality of caregiver-infant interactions, nutrition, and sleep. We hypothesize that these factors are
related to the age at which infants are observed to begin to reach, and we will determine the strength of the
associations and characteristics of infants reaching at different ages. The results will identify targets for
intervention that are most likely to be successful. Aim 3 will use EEG to determine how brain function changes
as reaching is refined from an unstable skill to a successful, lateralized (typically right arm preference) movement.
Using EEG will allow us to collect data in the home, both resting state and during arm movements. In Aim 3 we
will identify patterns of concurrent brain activity that differentiate between spontaneous arm movements, early
reaching attempts, and skilled reaches in infants with typical development. Based on our pilot data, we
hypothesize that frontal-parietal connectivity increases, interhemispheric connectivity decreases, and sources of
EEG activity shift from bilateral to unilateral as reaches become more goal directed, successful, and lateralized.
Aims 1–3 focus on infants with typical development; exploratory Aim 4 contrasts our findings with a population
likely to show impairment in learning to reach: infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. In exploratory Aim 4 we will
describe patterns of concurrent brain activity during spontaneous arm movements, early reaching attempts, and
skilled reaches in infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. Our results will determine the most relevant factors
related to an infant’s ability to refine his brain function and neuromotor control as he learns to reach."
10757731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a balloon-like bulge in a weakened area of a blood vessel in the brain.
Rupture of an IA leads to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a major cause of death and disability in stroke
patients. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to IA development are poorly
understood, which greatly impedes attempts to identify novel therapeutic targets for the disease.
Cerebrovascular integrity plays a pivotal role in IA development. In particular, focal adhesion (FA), a
property that enables endothelial cells to adhere to their extracellular matrix, is required for
cerebrovascular integrity. Recently, we named FA-phagy for “selective autophagy of FA” which can
regulate FA stability. Moreover, we identified p62 as the major cargo receptor for FA-phagy in endothelial
cells. Our central hypothesis is that p62-mediated endothelial FA-phagy impairs cerebrovascular integrity
and thus contributes to IA development. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) determine
the role of p62-mediated endothelial FA-phagy in cerebrovascular integrity and intracranial aneurysm
development; and 2) define the cargo recognition mechanisms in p62-mediated endothelial FA-phagy.
These proposed experiments may provide a firm scientific foundation for further treating IA disease by
targeting p62-mediated cargo recognition mechanisms. Importantly, this targeting cargo recognition
mechanism may precisely interfere with a specific type of autophagy and thus shift the current paradigm
on autophagy manipulation in vascular diseases, since most inhibitors in clinical trials block autophagic
core machinery that is shared in all types of autophagy, thus leading to unwanted consequences. Our
project's aims may collectively establish anti-FA-phagy strategy as a novel therapy for IA and potentially
for many other diseases due to the loss of vascular integrity."

Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The applicant's goal is to become an independent cardiovascular
investigator studying the thrombotic mechanisms underlying peripheral artery disease (PAD) development.
This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award describes a
focused plan for the applicant to acquire the research skills and expertise required to transition into an
independent investigator under the primary mentorship of Joshua A. Beckman, MD. The proposal centers on
the study of thrombosis and antithrombotic therapy in PAD.
PAD is a highly prevalent atherosclerotic disease associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. However, there remain notable gaps in our knowledge of the biologic pathways involved in PAD
development. Recent data suggest important contributions of thrombosis, through both coagulation cascade
activation and platelet activation, to the development of PAD. However, the mechanisms of thrombosis and
platelet activation contributing to PAD in humans are not fully known. The specific aims of the proposed
research are: (Aim 1) to quantify the risk conferred by activation of thrombotic pathways, in addition to
traditional cardiovascular risk factors, on PAD using Mendelian randomization; (Aim 2a) to test the hypothesis
that low-dose rivaroxaban, a clotting factor Xa inhibitor, improves macro- and microvascular endothelial
function in humans with PAD; and (Aim 2b) to test the hypothesis that low-dose rivaroxaban reduces PAR-1-
mediated platelet activation while also facilitating thrombolysis and reducing inflammation via downstream
signaling.
The candidate has a strong background in both clinical vascular genetics as well as epidemiology of PAD. The
proposed project will afford him new expertise in several key domains, including (1) genetic epidemiology and
Mendelian randomization methods, (2) design and implementation of clinical trials, (3) patient-oriented vascular
physiologic studies, and (4) translational investigations of thrombosis and platelet function. Vanderbilt
University Medical Center has an ideal environment to support the candidate's investigational career. He will
be supported by an outstanding mentorship team with extensive experience in clinical and translational
cardiovascular research. However, the proposal will also provide Dr. Aday the opportunity to develop into a
leading investigator with unique expertise in genetic epidemiology as well as mechanistic clinical trials focusing
on PAD. Data from the proposed studies will also serve as the basis for future mechanistic and interventional
studies (i.e. R01) of thrombosis in PAD. The support of this Career Development Award will provide Dr. Aday
with the tools necessary to lead his own independent clinical and translational research program."

Heart failure is a major cause of death in the US, contributing significantly to the burden of the healthcare
system every year. Despite the heterogeneity of the causes of heart failure, the heart undergoes gene
expression changes during failure resulting in structural and functional defects. Our long-term goal is to
understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that sustain the structure and function of the heart in
homeostasis and that can induce cardiac protective effects or promote cardiac repair upon injury.
In this application, we will use the transcription regulator Rtf1 as a point of entry to address this critical question
in cardiac biology.
Critical roles for transcription elongation in cellular RNA biogenesis have gained increasing attention in recent
years, but how they contribute to the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis and how modulating transcription
elongation might promote cardiac repair in damaged hearts remain elusive. Using both zebrafish and mouse
genetics, we have previously shown that Rtf1 activity is essential for myocardial development. Rtf1 depletion
destabilizes promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Pol II, blocks activation of the myocardial gene program and
prevents myocardial progenitor cell formation resulting in a heartless embryo. In preliminary data leading to
this proposal, we have found that Rtf1 plays important roles in normal and stressed adult hearts. Ablation of
Rtf1 activity in adult cardiomyocytes leads to rapid heart failure with dysregulated cardiac gene expression
and a loss of contractility. In stressed hearts, we observed elevated Rtf1 expression within cardiomyocytes
after injury, suggesting a role for Rtf1 in the cardiac stress response. Overexpression of Rtf1 also promotes
cardiomyocyte proliferation in a zebrafish ventricular resection model. The dysregulated cardiac gene
expression and reduction of epigenetic marks of active transcription in Rtf1-deficient failing hearts suggest
that Rtf1 functions as a key transcriptional regulator for cardiomyocytes. These findings lead to our central
hypothesis that Rtf1 modulates transcriptional pausing and co-transcriptional histone modification to facilitate
efficient mRNA synthesis in cardiomyocytes and thereby sustains cardiac structure and function in normal
and stressed hearts. We have delineated three Aims to interrogate this hypothesis. Specifically, we will
investigate Rtf1-dependent gene expression in cardiomyocytes and decipher the progressive molecular,
cellular, physiological and metabolomic changes occurring during heart failure (Aim 1). We will use an array
of molecular approaches to uncover the molecular basis by which Rtf1 impacts the transcriptome in
cardiomyocytes (Aim 2). We will also investigate how Rtf1 responds to cardiac damage and the potential of
manipulating Rtf1 activity to promote cardiac repair (Aim 3). Accomplishing these aims will not only provide
significant new insights into the regulatory network of cardiac gene expression but also a possible therapeutic
target to promote cardiac health and post-injury repair."
10767294,"Defining the genetic landscape of nanophthalmos and the role of MYRF
ABSTRACT:
Nanophthalmos is part of a spectrum of disorders characterized by a small eye and resultant high hyperopia. It
is frequently complicated by angle closure glaucoma, strabismus, amblyopia, and serous retinal and choroidal
detachments. The pathogenesis of this condition is poorly understood, but genetic factors are thought to be a
strong contributor. I have identified a novel human disease gene for familial nanophthalmos, myelin regulatory
factor (MYRF), which also leads to retinal degeneration and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) disruption in mice.
This gene encodes a pleiotropic transcription factor and has been implicated in a multi-system disorder
featuring cardiac, urogenital defects, and high hyperopia. The primary goals of my proposal are to: (i) identify
the molecular targets of MYRF in the eye; (ii) define the mechanism by which disruption of MYRF leads to
human disease and RPE dysfunction; and (iii) identify novel genetic contributors to the pathogenesis of high
hyperopia. My over-arching hypothesis is that MYRF serves as a master regulator of RPE differentiation,
and that disruption of key downstream targets of MYRF also leads to nanophthalmos by disrupting RPE
structure and/or function. This hypothesis will be tested by: (i) determining the molecular targets of MYRF
through single-cell RNA sequencing and CUT&RUN sequencing; and (ii) defining the clinical and genetic
heterogeneity in families with high hyperopia and nanophthalmos. My long-term goal is to become an
independent clinician investigator who focuses on identifying and treating inherited ocular disorders, and
understanding molecular pathogenesis. To facilitate this goal, I have assembled a team of mentors and
collaborators with relevant expertise; this team includes a developmental geneticist, an ophthalmology
clinician-scientist, a medical geneticist, and an expert in genomics and bioinformatics. My mentors and I have
developed a structured training plan focused on didactic and hands-on experience. Together with this team
and a strong institutional environment, I will train in developmental biology, bioinformatics, and genomics,
which are all required for my professional development and completion of this proposal. This career
development trajectory will allow me to develop into a leading clinician-scientist in ophthalmic genetics, and
provide a direct link between my clinical practice and my basic science research. It also will provide me with
the skills to complete full cycles of gene discovery, which can have direct implications on patient care. This
proposal will lead to insights into a novel pathway regulating RPE development and identify novel genes that
regulate eye growth, which will establish a critical new area of future investigation."

 What are the aberrant brain processes that lead to symptoms of schizophrenia—to the distressing and
disabling hallucinations, delusions, disorganization, and loss of motivation? Answering this question is central
to developing targeted and effective treatments. Prominent mechanistic accounts of schizophrenia hinge on
the notion of the brain as a “prediction machine” that maintains and updates a mental model of the probabilistic
structure of the environment, which it uses in concert with sensory input to make sense of the world.
Schizophrenia has been associated with an abnormality in this interpretative process, leading to abnormal
perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. What is currently lacking, however, is an empirical basis for delineating the
specific nature of prediction abnormalities in schizophrenia, at the level of both behavior and brain.
 The general aim of the current project is to understand how visual perception is influenced by
experience-based predictions in the schizophrenia. The visual system is a uniquely suited system for
understanding prediction abnormalities in clinical populations for several reasons. First, robust behavioral
paradigms can quantify the influence of predictions on visual perception. Second, parallel neurophysiology and
neuroimaging work provides a basis for interpretation at the level of neuronal populations. Understanding these
abnormalities in vision, then, may provide a scalable framework for understanding symptoms more generally.
Furthermore, visual distortions are observed in schizophrenia before illness onset, and they relate to important
clinical factors. Understanding prediction in the visual system can help explain specific clinical phenomenology.
 The current project proposes to investigate the influence of prior experience on visual processing by
measuring visual aftereffects and their neural concomitants. Aftereffects are illusory perception of the
“opposite” that arises after prolonged viewing of a image. Characterizing visual aftereffects in the
schizophrenia spectrum can provide important insights into the computational and biological underpinnings of
abnormal prediction. The substantial existing literature on the neural and computational origins of aftereffects
means that different aftereffects can reveal at what level of the sensory hierarchy, and in which specific
component processes, prediction abnormalities emerge. Specific study goals are to 1) characterize visual
aftereffects in the schizophrenia spectrum; 2) determine whether they are present across illness stages and in
individuals at-risk for the disorder; 3) evaluate the clinical relevance of altered visual aftereffects; and 4) to
measure neuroimaging concomitants of altered aftereffects and link them to computational model components.
Visual aftereffects can provide a tool with which to empirically test a canonical computational mechanism as
the basis for both altered visual experience and symptom genesis generally, namely an inappropriate use of
prior experience in generating the contents of consciousness."

As pain is often the first sign of injury or illness, individual differences in pain perception or communication can
impact diagnosis and treatment of dangerous health conditions. In this proposal, we will investigate differences
in pain perception for autistic adults who may have difficulty communicating about pain due to autism-related
communication difficulties. Emerging evidence suggests autistic adults experience pain differently than non-
autistic adults. Autistic adults report higher pain intensity and more pain-related anxiety compared to non-autistic
adults. Additionally, the pattern of neural responses to pain in autistic adults suggests altered central processing
of pain. However, most of these studies have been conducted in younger autistic adults (<40yrs). This is
concerning as many painful chronic medical conditions become prevalent in mid-adulthood (e.g., back pain,
arthritis, diabetes) and reports suggest autistic adults experience these conditions are an even greater rate,
increasing the potential for disparate pain management in this population. In non-autistic populations, older age
is consistently associated with decreased pain sensitivity. Endogenous modulation of pain in aging is associated
with increased central sensitization (facilitation of pain), and less efficient descending pain modulation (inhibition
of pain). Our preliminary data suggests that autistic adults are affected with persistent pain in adulthood and that
this increases with age. Our conceptual framework suggests that autistic adults may experience persistent pain
in adulthood due to 3 factors: 1) increased pain sensitivity, 2) altered endogenous pain modulation, and 3)
difficulty in pain assessment.
The overall goal of this cross-sectional study is to investigate how pain differs in autistic adults (n=40, ages 30-
70 yrs) compared to age, race, and sex matched non-autistic adults (n=40). To examine how pain perception
may differ for autistic adults, this exploratory R21 will address two targeted knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we will
use a standard battery of multi-modality (heat and pressure) quantitative sensory testing to address both sensory
and affective pain sensitivity. In Aim 2, we will examine differences in endogenous pain modulatory systems in
autistic adults using both temporal summation (to address pain facilitation) and conditioned pain modulation (to
address pain inhibition). At the end of this study, we will better understand critical differences in pain perception
that may place autistic adults at risk for persistent pain in adulthood. For autistic adults, differences in pain
processing and endogenous pain modulation, coupled with difficulty in social communication and healthcare
access, could lead to poor pain outcomes. The knowledge gained from this study on mechanistic differences in
pain sensitivity and endogenous pain modulation will help build a framework for development of new pain
assessment tools and targeted pain management interventions for autistic adults."
10840361,"It is a nearly ubiquitous phenomenon – teens have a difficult time going to sleep early enough to get a
full night of sleep. The resulting sleep curtailment is associated with a variety of negative consequences
including depression, substance abuse, fatigue, poor academic or work performance, poor socialization,
increased risk-taking behavior, and an increased risk for the development of diabetes and obesity. According to
the Department of Health and Human Services in Healthy People 2020, fewer than one-third of all students in
grades 9-12 get sufficient sleep – a number that has remained unchanged since 2009. This pervasive loss of
sleep in adolescence is often debilitating for both the teen and the family. There are both biological (natural
delay in circadian timing) and social causes, which are mutually reinforcing, for this delay in sleep timing.
 As a treatment for the biological component, bright light “phototherapy” is often prescribed for teens
who wish to go to sleep earlier. This treatment often consists of 1-2 hours of bright light administered every day
prior to desired wake time; this treatment is meant to advance the timing of the circadian clock to an earlier
hour. This means that an adolescent who needs to wake up at 7AM for school would need instead to wake up at
5 or 6 AM and sit in front of bright lights for hours every day (the changes in circadian timing would revert
without the daily light exposure), a difficult if not impossible set of instructions to follow. We have recently
demonstrated that: (1) sequences of brief, millisecond light flashes are more potent than continuous light at
changing the timing of the circadian clock, (2) exposure to such sequences of light during sleep impacts
circadian timing without significantly interfering with sleep, and (3) at-home exposure to such sequences to
teens increases self-reported nightly sleep by nearly one-hour per night. We hypothesize that such a light
sequence can increase objective measures of sleep length, as well as improve mood and cognition in teens.
 In order to examine these hypotheses, adolescents enrolled full-time in high school will be recruited to
take part in a 10-week, at-home placebo-controlled parallel group study, followed by a 10-week open-label
study. For 8 of the 10 weeks of the parallel group study and during all 10 weeks of the open-label study,
adolescents will be exposed to a sequence of flashes while they sleep. The quality and quantity of their
objectively-determined sleep, measurements of mood from both the adolescent’s and the parent’s perspectives,
and executive function, will be captured before, during, and at the end of the protocol.
 Results from this experiment could fundamentally change the manner in which delayed sleep is treated,
significantly improving sleep in adolescents and simultaneously improving mood, academic performance, and
family life. Results from this study will also be useful in understanding how light administration during sleep
could be useful in the treatment of circadian-based sleep disorders, such as jet lag, shift work sleep disorder,
and Advanced Sleep Wake Phase Disorder."

Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."

Children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) may have worse neurodevelopmental outcomes
compared to their HIV-unexposed and uninfected (HUU) peers. However, the etiology of this potential
association is unclear. With a growing population of children who are HIV-exposed, making up over 15% of
children in some countries, there is a critical need to identify evidence-based risk factors associated with poor
neurodevelopment to appropriately target interventions. The specific objectives of this application are: (1): to
evaluate potential risk factors longitudinally over the first 2 years of life in children who are HEU and HUU and
define those associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months, and (2) to create a risk
assessment tool to predict which children will have worse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The central
hypothesis is that children who are HEU and HUU will have different neurodevelopmental outcomes; and that
we can use risk factors to predict which children are at risk for worse outcomes before 2 years of age. The
rationale for developing this tool is to identify children at risk for worse neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier to
allow for targeted intervention. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the potential risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in
young children. In Aim 2, we will compare neurodevelopmental outcomes between 24-month-old children who
are HEU and those who are HUU in Kenya. In Aim 3, we will create a risk assessment tool to predict which
children are at risk for worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months of age. This study will leverage an
existing cohort to prospectively enroll 500 children who are HEU and 500 who are HUU and longitudinally
follow them from birth to 24 months of age. Within the first aim, the following factors will be measured every 6
months: infectious morbidity, biological risk factors, and social risk factors (both sociodemographic and
psychosocial). We will then compare these factors between children who are HEU and HUU. Within the
second aim, we will measure neurodevelopment (cognition, language, motor, and behavior) in children at 24
months of age using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development,
3rd edition, which our team has culturally-adapted and internally validated for use in Kenya. We will then
compare neurodevelopmental outcomes between children who are HEU and HUU, providing well-powered
data to determine whether differences truly exist between the groups. Finally, within the third aim, we will use
generalized linear mixed modeling to quantify associations among multiple factors on child neurodevelopment
and create a risk assessment tool for use in children <24 months. The proposed study is significant, as we will
determine interconnected factors associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children who are
HEU and HUU in Kenya. The resulting risk assessment tool will allow clinical providers to institute interventions
for children at risk for worse neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. This work will also create a longitudinal
cohort of children exposed to antiretroviral therapy and HIV that may be monitored for future studies."

millions of US dollars, research is ongoing to determine whether proton therapy improves treatment outcomes.
A sensitive diagnostic tool for the evaluation of alveoli architecture in this active research area would not only
enable early targeted treatment to slow down progression of radiation-induced lung fibrosis but also
significantly benefit the ongoing preclinical evaluation. The imaging tools currently in use have a poor to
moderate sensitivity that is insufficient for detecting early changes in the lungs and/or are proving impractical
with respect to radiation dose and logistical complexity for longitudinal preclinical studies. To address this critical
need, we introduce an imaging tool for early detection of lung microstructural changes by advancing the
emerging field of x-ray darkfield imaging. In conventional x-ray, image contrast is formed by attenuation based
on the interpretation of x-rays as particles. If sensing x-rays as electromagnetic waves, additional x-ray contrast
mechanisms such as diffraction, phase-shift and small-angle scattering can be accessed. X-ray scattering on
healthy, gas-filled pulmonary alveoli generates a strong darkfield signal, and the signal decreases when
the integrity of the alveoli is affected. Preliminary in-vivo small animal experiments successfully demonstrated
an on average ten-weeks-earlier detection of early onset of radiation-induced lung fibrosis from
conventional photon therapy. A number of methods for acquiring x-ray darkfield images have been investigated
in recent years. However, current solutions require complicated, shock-sensitive and expensive hardware
implementations. A more practical method involves the use of filters consisting of random structures (so-called
diffusers) to generate near-field interference speckle patterns for acquiring darkfield images. Our long-term
goal is translating x-ray dark-field imaging from physics research laboratories into the preclinical imaging arena
to provide the needed tool for longitudinal lung assessment. Our solution includes the design of novel deep-
learning based speckle tracking in combination with a diffuser design based on nanoparticles which is
inexpensive to fabricate compared to gratings. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1) to develop a
software infrastructure for in-vivo small animal x-ray darkfield imaging, (2) to implement an x-ray darkfield
prototype for detection of early pulmonary toxicity from radiotherapy, and (3) to evaluate x-ray darkfield prototype
performance in phantoms and in-vivo longitudinal animal studies. This proposal will advance the field of speckle-
based x-ray dark-field imaging by deepening the basic understanding and by translating it from physics
research laboratories into the preclinical arena. Toward this end, we anticipate that our x-ray dark-field
imaging concept will serve as a low-dose tool for longitudinal in-vivo small animal studies. The proposed
solutions have the potential to drive the translation of x-ray dark-field imaging forward into the clinical routine."

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been
challenging to acquire consistent MRI measurements of MS disease burden. Spectral domain optical
coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina has emerged as a complementary source of imaging biomarkers,
wherein retinal thickness measurements have been shown to correlate well with MS disease burden. As well,
OCT angiography (OCTA)—a new imaging modality acquired with the same OCT scanner—yields multiple
new biomarkers among which macular vessel density has been shown to correlate with MS disability. There is
strong evidence that OCT and OCTA may provide much needed imaging biomarkers for MS, but there are
remaining technical challenges to overcome. Many algorithms for computation of retinal layer thicknesses
from OCT images have been developed, but measurement of longitudinal changes in individual MS subjects
remains highly challenging, especially in MS where yearly changes are small relative to intrinsic measurement
variations. We propose a novel iterative registration and deep learning segmentation algorithm for longitudinal
OCT retinal image segmentation. Development of automatic algorithms for analysis of OCTA images is in an
early stage and there are opportunities for significant improvements. We will develop a deep network for OCTA
vessel segmentation and biomarker computation that both suppresses artifacts that are common in OCTA and
provides consistent results across different scanners. As both OCT and OCTA become more widely used in
the characterization and management of MS, it is becoming increasingly important to jointly characterize these
biomarkers and relate them to disease status, which is currently characterized largely by clinical evaluations.
We will address the central question of whether OCT and OCTA can be used to predict disease progression by
developing a new disease progression score for MS based on multiple OCT and OCTA measurements as well
as clinical and MRI biomarkers, acquired in both single and multiple imaging visits. The proposed research will:
1) Develop a fast, topologically-correct longitudinal segmentation method for the macula; 2) Develop a method
for artifact-suppressed and consistent computation of OCTA features in the macula; 3) Develop a disease
progression score to jointly characterize longitudinal retinal OCT and OCTA measurements in MS; and
4) Carry out longitudinal studies of healthy controls and people with MS using OCT and OCTA measurements.
We will assess whether average features within the macula or features averaged over smaller segments yield
better estimates of progression. We will also assess whether OCT alone or OCT together with OCTA provide
better estimates of progression. Image processing and disease progression algorithms will be made freely
available to the research community. The proposed research will greatly advance the use of OCT and OCTA
in characterizing longitudinal changes in the retina, potentially leading to standard eye measurements for
monitoring and managing MS and other neurological and eye diseases."

Covalent post-translational protein modifications (PTMs) contribute to all aspects of cell physiology and are a
major source of protein functional diversity in mammalian cells. Aberrant regulation of PTMs is a common
feature of human diseases. Our research focuses on two important PTMs: protein methylation at lysine and
histidine residues. Our overarching goal is to elucidate at a molecular level the physiologic roles for lysine and
histidine methylation signaling in the regulation of chromatin biology, epigenetics and other fundamental
biological processes, and to understand how disruption in these mechanisms contributes to human disease.
Within this research framework we will investigate the biology and function of enzymes that regulate histone
methylation dynamics, with a focus on methylation at histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36). Beyond histone
methylation, there is a growing appreciation that a number of non-histone proteins, including several with clear
roles in gene expression and signal transduction are lysine methylated. Indeed, there are likely far greater than
one hundred lysine methyltransferases in the human genome, and an increasing number of examples of
mutation or translocation of these genes being linked to human disorders. Thus, it is likely that deregulation in
non-histone protein methylation homeostasis plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis. We will explore the
biology and function of new enzymes and non-histone protein methylation signaling pathways. In addition to
lysine methylation, other residues like histidine are also methylated; though relatively little is known about the
histidine methylation modification network. We will explore the hypothesis that protein histidine methylation has
an underappreciated and significant role in signal transduction, cell biology, and disease pathogenesis. For our
studies, we will use a multi-disciplinary strategy that include biochemical, molecular, proteomic, genomic,
cellular and mouse modeling approaches."
10814945,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by diseased arteries to the limbs, affects 200 million people
worldwide and 9 million people in the U.S. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the U.S.
and confers a markedly higher risk for PAD. Yet patients with CKD are less likely to have revascularization
procedures and are more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation than patients without CKD. In addition
to a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients with CKD
have other unique risk factors such as chronic inflammation or uremia, which in turn can lead to more
aggressive PAD at a younger age. Therefore, patients with CKD need dedicated study. Our overarching goal is
to help close these evidence gaps and address these limitations by harnessing the power of Optum
Clinformatics Data Mart, which includes over 7 billion claims records on over 83 million unique lives from all 50
states spanning 2005-2019. Our secondary goal is to facilitate future PAD studies using real-world data by
leveraging the power of natural language processing to improve our ability to accurately and automatically
ascertain PAD from large electronic health record databases. Our innovative algorithm will be of particular
importance among subgroups where clinical trial evidence is limited, such as in advanced CKD. Our proposal
has the Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis-
requiring CKD. We hypothesize that patients with CKD undergoing surgical versus endovascular
revascularization will have longer initial hospitalization, but fewer subsequent major adverse limb events. AIM
2: To evaluate antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after lower extremity revascularization in patients
with non-dialysis-requiring CKD. We hypothesize that real-world patients with CKD treated with antiplatelet
medications or direct oral anticoagulants after lower extremity revascularization will have higher rates of
bleeding but lower rates of major adverse limb events. AIM 3: To develop an algorithm that accurately and
automatically ascertains PAD from electronic health record databases. We hypothesize that a natural language
processing-approach applied to diagnostic vascular testing reports will have better test performance (i.e.
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) for identifying PAD than a traditional approach
that uses administrative billing codes. Manual chart review will serve as the gold standard."

 by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.
 2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning

 also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from
 6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.

 Specifically, we will:
 1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle
 and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine
 learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used
 by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.
 2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning
 models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-
 series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s
gait).
 3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify
 kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will
 also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from
 6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.
 Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation
outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral
palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and
treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive

10817894,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE
The Clinical/Translational Core provides an infrastructure and resources for human translational and patient-
oriented research. This is accomplished in part by providing translational resources for liver investigators who
are basic scientists, such as making bio-specimens available and offering iPSC’s/liver organoids derived from
patients with specific diseases. The Core is useful for clinical researchers as well, who also make use of bio-
specimens and our patient registry, plus the services of our research coordinator and statisticians. Therefore,
the Clinical/Translational Core advances the science and practice of Hepatology through the following specific
aims: (1) Provide resources necessary to support clinical and translational research, specifically: (a)
biostatistical support, including study design and data analysis, with plans to increase expertise in database
research, (b) bioinformatic support, including analysis and interpretation of whole-exome and whole-genome
sequencing, RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, microRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and 16S/18S and shotgun
metagenomics, (c) patient registry and biospecimen repository, with recent extension of this repository to include
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that can be transformed into iPSCs, as well as human bile, both of
which can be used in the creation of liver organoids, and (d) staff support, including a research coordinator who
can help locate/retrieve biospecimens from the liver center repository or from other relevant repositories at our
institution, and a liver pathologist, who is available for consultation, retrieval and review of archived clinical
specimens, and interpretation of other tissue specimens, such as from animal models. (2) Provide the
environment in which high-quality clinical and translational research will be centered, thereby translating
knowledge from basic science to clinical research, contributing to the development of young clinical investigators
and creating collaborations among center members and other members of the scientific community interested
in research relevant to liver. As a result of these efforts, half of the members who now use this core are laboratory-
based investigators, and all center members who currently use this core collaborate with other center members."
10817899,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM
The Pilot Feasibility Program seeks to introduce new investigators and ideas to the Liver Center, to promote
novel ideas that may advance the field of hepatology, and to enable investigators to obtain data for future grant
submissions, such as R01 applications. Candidates for funding in order of priority consist of: (1) senior
postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty; (2) established University investigators in other fields who wish to apply
their areas of expertise to subjects of Center interest; and (3) Center members who wish to pursue a project
that is different from their current focus of interest and who need to develop preliminary data to apply for new
R01-type funding. Despite limited and essentially level funding for this program during the past 31 years, this
component of the Center has provided us with an annual opportunity to solicit applications for pilot project
awards from throughout the Yale community. This has enabled the Center to continually revitalize its
membership and to capitalize on new technologies and research opportunities of importance to the continued
development of the Center's research base. For example, during the past 6 years this program has enabled
the Center to bring new investigators into the Center with expertise in diverse but cutting-edge areas. Pilot
Feasibility projects also were pivotal for the development of novel technologies such as iPSC-derived
cholangiocytes, as well as biliary organoids derived from liver tissue or bile. The program has been successful
by a variety of other metrics: awardees over the past 11 years published 66 manuscripts as a direct result of
their funding and competed successfully for 36 new grants, representing a 17-fold return on investment. In
addition, 45 of the 46 awardees (including those who left Yale) remain involved in digestive diseases-related
research. Moreover, in the last 12 years (including grants that were just awarded September 2019), 73% of the
37 Pilot/Feasibility awardees who are still at Yale remain active Center members."
10817901,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ENRICHMENT PROGRAM
The Enrichment Program provides opportunities for education and networking for the Liver Center in four related
ways. First, the Program provides Center members with the latest information about their specific areas of
interest. Second, the Program seeks to broaden the appreciation that Center members have for related areas of
research in liver biology and pathobiology. Third, the Program seeks to enhance collaboration among Center
members; in part because of the enrichment program, nearly all Center members collaborate with at least one
other Center member and half of all Center-related publications are co-authored by multiple Center members.
Finally, the Program serves as an outreach mechanism to non-liver physicians, scientists and lay people to
enhance their understanding of liver disease. We have established several mechanisms to achieve these goals.
These include (1) a monthly seminar series, (2) an annual retreat, (3) a quarterly newsletter, (4) certain special
scientific and educational programs and symposia, (5) an annual visiting professorship program “reverse mini-
sabbatical”, and (6) a website. All Center seminars, conferences, symposia, and newsletters are posted on the
Center’s website, which is updated weekly, and advertised via poster and e-mail notification. Through these
activities, the Enrichment Program creates opportunities for open discussions of the latest developments in the
fields of liver pathophysiology and treatment. The Enrichment Program fosters collaborations, publications and
grants by bringing leaders in the most advanced areas of hepatology research to Yale. This represents a
particularly valuable opportunity for junior investigators to develop networking, establish relevant collaborations,
and obtain access to important and unique reagents and technologies."
10758546,"Mechanosensitive (MS) channels sense and respond to mechanical forces by opening an ion-conducting
pathway. MS channels are found in all kingdoms of life, and in humans play essential roles in a number of
sensory processes, including hearing, the sense of touch, balance and regulation of blood pressure. The first
MS channels likely evolved in early prokaryotes as protection from hypoosmotic stress. Because bacterial MS
channels are ubiquitously expressed in bacteria, but not in humans, and because their uncontrolled opening has
a deleterious and often lethal effect on the bacteria, presumably due to the loss of important metabolites, bacterial
MS channels are intriguing targets for developing novel antibiotics. Bacteria express two types of MS channels,
MS channels of large conductance (MscL) and MS channels of small conductance (MscS). Members of the MscL
family are highly conserved and MscL has become a paradigm for the understanding of MS channels because
of its simplicity and amenability to different experimental approaches. MscS channels are more diverse, and
bacteria often express more than one paralog. Both bacterial MS channels are gated based on the ‘force-from-
lipids’ principle and respond to the transmembrane pressure profile of the surrounding membrane. However,
even though structures are available for MscL and MscS in different functional states, the mechanism by which
membrane tension opens these channels has remained enigmatic. We have recently determined cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of MscS in different membrane environments, provided by nanodiscs, including
one mimicking a membrane under tension. The structures, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and electrophysiological studies, allowed us to visualize the channel in different functional states and
to deduce what roles lipids associated with MscS play in mechanosensation. We will continue to use a
combination of single-particle cryo-EM, patch-clamp electrophysiology and MD simulations to study the structure
and gating of bacterial MS channels. In Aim 1, we will continue to explore the function of lipids in MscS function,
in particular whether it adopts a defined open conformation in a native lipid environment, how modulators affect
MscS by changing its lipid environment, and whether 16-carbon acyl chains play a specific role in MscS gating.
In Aim 2, we will expand our studies to bacterial cyclic nucleotide-gated (bCNG) channels to elucidate how the
MscS fold was adapted to make the channel respond to cAMP binding rather than membrane tension. Aim 3 will
focus on MscL. We will determine the structure of MscL in a native lipid environment to confirm (or disprove) the
existence of lipid-filled nano-pockets that were suggested to play a critical role in gating. Finally, we will determine
the structure of MscL opened by different effectors to visualize the structure of this channel in the open state and
to test our hypothesis that different effectors result in open conformations with different pore diameters. The
results of these studies will not only provide new insights into the gating mechanism of bacterial MS channels,
but also help in exploiting these channels for biomedical applications."

In 2020, breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women.
Compared to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, ER-negative (ER-) breast cancers have worse
prognoses and no effective prevention strategies. In this study, we will explore new strategies for
immunoprevention of ER- breast cancer. Inducing potent anti-tumor immunity for prevention of poorly
immunogenic breast cancers has been highly challenging. Engagement and expansion of activated dendritic
cells (DCs) could facilitate broad and efficient anti-tumor immunities. However, certain existing DC stimulators
(e.g., agonists of toll-like receptors and STING) also triggered adverse immune responses. For cancer
prevention, it is imperative to develop safe and effective approaches to boost DC immunity. To this end, we
screened for dietary supplements that increase DC activities and identified natural vitamin E (VitE) as a stimulator
of DC functions. Excitingly, we found that breast cancer patients who took VitE during immunotherapies had a
significantly better survival rate and improved therapeutic response than patients who didn’t take VitE,
suggesting that VitE administration may potentiate anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, systemic (oral) administration
and local (at injection site together with cancer vaccines) delivery of VitE significantly prolonged tumor-free
survival in ER- mammary tumor mouse models that didn’t respond to cancer vaccines alone. These data led us
to hypothesize that VitE administration, via reinforcing DC activation and antigen presentation, enhances
immunoprevention of ER- breast cancer by cancer vaccines. We will test whether VitE could enhance cancer
vaccine-induced immune surveillance and prevent/delay tumor initiation/progression in genetic engineered
mouse models of (HER2+ and basal-like subtypes) ER- mammary tumors and the CD34+ humanized mouse
models (for prevention of human ER- breast cancers) (Aim1). As a proof of concept, we will primarily use a triple-
antigen (tumor associated antigens neu/IGFBP-2/IGF-IR) peptide vaccine (TAVac) for proposed studies since
TAVac has shown partial efficacy in delaying tumor progression in ER- mammary tumor mouse models.
Importantly, corresponding DNA vaccines against human HER2/IGFBP-2/IGF-IR are currently under phase I/II
clinical studies for prevention of HER2+ and HER2- breast cancer recurrence. To gain mechanistic insights into
how VitE potentiates anti-tumor immunity, we will investigate i) the global effect of VitE on the immune cell
landscape by mass cytometry (CyTOF); ii) the impact of VitE on DC and T-cell subset compositions, functionality
and signaling networks; iii) major immunophenotype changes critical for VitE-enhanced immunoprevention; iv)
how VitE prompts antigen processing/presentation in DCs and whether VitE functions through SHP1, a critical
DC checkpoint (Aim2). Finally, we will test novel strategies to further improve the immunoprevention efficacy
against ER- mammary tumors (Aim3). If successful, our strategies could be readily tested in future clinic trials
for immunoprevention of breast cancer, particularly, for women at high risk for ER- breast cancer."

According to the World Health Organization, age-related lens pathologies are the leading cause of visual
impairment in the world. Cataracts, defined as any opacity in the eye lens, remain the leading cause of
blindness in the world. Presbyopia is caused by a reduction in the lens’ ability to change shape during focusing
(accommodation), and, by extension, the need for reading glasses. Unaddressed presbyopia is the leading
cause of visual impairment globally. Decades of study have focused on congenital lens pathologies, and thus,
very little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that facilitate lifelong lens
homeostasis. Recent studies have reported that mutations of the EphA2 receptor or the ephrin-A5 ligand are
associated with variable congenital and age-related cataracts in humans and mice, and these bidirectional
signaling molecules are key components for regulating lens cell organization and stability.
 Our mouse models reveal that loss of EphA2 leads to age-related cortical cataracts similar to human
patients with EphA2 dysfunction. We will evaluate cataract progression in our mouse line to study the cellular
and molecular changes that occur during cortical cataract formation. We hypothesize that loss of EphA2 results
in changes in cytoskeletal structures or cell-cell adhesion of peripheral fiber cells leading to optical
discontinuities in the lens cortex.
 Our new data show that the lens utilizes both canonical ligand-mediated EphA2 bidirectional signaling and
non-canonical ligand-independent EphA2 signaling pathways. We hypothesize that canonical EphA2 signaling
is required in equatorial epithelial cells while non-canonical EphA2 activation is required for fiber cell
differentiation and maturation and that this segregation of receptor activity may explain the large variety of
human congenital and age-related cataracts caused by EphA2 mutations. We will evaluate the activation
pattern of EphA2 spatially and temporally and determine the activity of known downstream pathways in
different lens cell populations. We will apply EphA2 agonist and antagonist peptides to primary culture mouse
lens epithelial cells to generate mini lenses as an in vitro model for lens development.
 Increased size and stiffness of the lens center or nucleus has been hypothesized to be a key factor for not
only age-related increases in overall lens stiffness and presbyopia, but also poor nutrient and waste transport
leading to age-related nuclear cataracts. Our new preliminary data shows that loss of EphA2 leads to softer,
smaller lens nuclei. We hypothesize that Eph-ephrin signaling is required for normal cell-cell adhesion and
cytoskeleton rearrangement that drives nuclear fiber cell membrane re-organization and compaction. This data
will provide a better understanding of coordinated signaling mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis during
normal aging and in lenses with changes in transparency and biomechanical properties, which may lead to the
development of new non-surgical approaches to delay or prevent age-related lens pathologies."

Previously, we carried out large-scale analysis of mucosal cytokines and HIV acquisition in high-risk women from
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, enrolled as part of the CAPRISA 004 TFV 1% gel study (n = 774). Using a
prospective cohort design, we validated our previous finding that inflammatory cytokines increase the risk of HIV
acquisition. Of the cytokines associated with increased risk, one of the strongest associations was observed for
the key type I IFN, IFN2 (p = 10E-6). Women in upper quartile for IFN2 were at 4-fold greater risk of acquiring
HIV, compared to women in the lowest quartile (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-9.1). On the surface this seems counter-
intuitive, as type I IFN have strong anti-HIV effects both in vitro and when given in vivo as a therapeutic or
prophylactic in non-human primate model. To reconcile these observations, we hypothesize that chronic type
I IFN upregulation in the female reproductive tract (FRT) leads to dysregulation of IFN signaling, resulting
in downregulation of antiviral genes, increase in generalized inflammation and increase in susceptibility
of target cells at the site of infection. This hypothesis would provide an explanation as to why a classical anti-
viral program that should be protective actually leads to higher rates of HIV acquisition. Utilizing samples from
the ongoing CAPRISA 018 tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) sub-dermal implant trial, we will determine whether
prolonged IFN2 upregulation in the FRT leads to decreased IFN responsiveness and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG)
expression in genital immune cells. Next, we will formally test if the chronic increase in IFN2 expression and
ISG downregulation correspond to breakthrough HIV infections in young women enrolled in CAPRISA 018.
Finally, we will use an in vitro PBMC model to determine the mechanism by which prolonged IFN upregulation
leads to ISG downregulation and subsequent increase in HIV risk."
10867260,"We are developing a visual prosthesis that can restore vision to the blind. Finding a treatment for blindness is
significant as it is projected to impact 1 in 28 individuals over the age of 45 by the year 2030 (~3.5% of the
population), including over 100,000 Veterans. Further, blindness is associated with increased levels of
depression, obesity, diabetes, and accidental falls, and estimates suggest two-thirds of the blind are
unemployed. Potential treatments are under development, including pharmaceutical, genetic, stem cell,
optogenetic and prosthetic approaches, but almost all target the retina and thus offer little hope to a large
portion of the blind population. This includes battlefield soldiers, returning from combat with bilateral traumatic
eye injury, and other members of the general population with similar afflictions. It also includes those with
glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, the 3 most common cause of blindness
in aging Veterans (and the general population). The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus is an
attractive site for implantation of a prosthesis as it is beyond the disease/trauma associated with most causes
of blindness and thus a working device would offer a treatment to large portions of the blind population. In
addition, the LGN is more spatially expansive than the retina and thus allows for a larger number of stimulation
sites and higher acuity. At the same time, the neural signaling patterns used by LGN neurons are much less
abstract than those of the visual cortex, thereby allowing for more straightforward encoding schemes (than
those required by cortical prostheses). While it has been challenging to develop a high-count, multi-channel
device that can safely be implanted into a deep brain structure, our colleagues have recently developed such a
device and much effort is underway to advance this technology. However, little is known about how to
effectively stimulate the LGN with a prosthesis and this lack of understanding will impede progress towards a
clinical device. Here, we propose 4 Aims focused on learning how to effectively drive LGN neurons with a
prosthesis. Our initial testing shows that stimulation from of the LGN can indeed drive downstream visual
circuits and further, that primary visual cortex (V1) is activated as well (secondary to the activation of the LGN).
Thus, our Aims will focus on determining how to most effectively activate the LGN and we will explore whether
the same conditions that maximize LGN activation also produce robust activation of visual cortex. As part of
this investigation, we will also explore whether individual cell types in LGN have different sensitivities to electric
stimulation as is the case in many other regions of the CNS. This will be quite useful as the different layers of
LGN are comprised of different cell types and understanding how to optimally activate each may lead to better
outcomes. Finally, we will evaluate the stability of performance for implanted devices for chronic implantation.
We believe that the comprehensive evaluation proposed here will provide a foundation from which to
systematically advance future pre-clinical and clinical studies."

Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrate that cancer progression depends on the interactions of
malignant cells with other elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functions of cancer-associated
fibroblasts, endothelial cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells and other stromal elements in regulating tumor
growth and progression have been intensively investigated. Peripheral neurons are now also recognized as
important constituents of the tumor milieu. The degree of tumor innervation is directly correlated with cancer
progression and metastasis, and inversely correlated with patient survival. Several mechanisms responsible
for nerve-mediated cancer progression have been proposed, including regulatory activity of neurotransmitters
and neuropeptides on tumor-associated vasculature and immune infiltrate. Thus far, work in this area largely
focused on the role of the autonomic nervous system in promoting cancer, with several reports also implicating
the somatic afferent innervation. However, the role of the neuroglia of the peripheral nervous system in
promoting cancer progression remains unclear. Specifically, excluding the process of perineural invasion, the
extent to which Schwann cells (SCs), principal glia of the peripheral nervous system, modulate TME and
facilitate cancer progression has not been investigated. We demonstrated that SCs are present in human
melanoma tissue, and that they accelerate tumor growth and metastasis in several melanoma mouse models.
We discovered that this effect is due to the activation of repair SCs, and their inhibition of tertiary lymphoid
structure (TLS) formation and protective anti-tumor immune responses. However, the mechanism of SC
immunomodulation in TME remains unknown. We hypothesize that melanoma-associated repair SCs
promote immune tolerance to melanoma, and their targeting is a novel immunotherapy approach against
cancer. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue two Specific Aims: 1) determine the mechanism of
immunomodulation by repair SCs in melanoma, and 2) target repair SCs in melanoma as a novel approach
to therapy. In Aim 1, we will examine how SCs promote immune tolerance of cancer and impede TLS
formation in tumors, focusing on Slit2, MAG, and p75NTR signaling mechanisms. Transgenic
immunocompetent autochthonous BrafCA melanoma and slow Wallerian degeneration WldS mouse models
will be utilized. In Aim 2, we will test whether targeting melanoma-associated repair SCs to break immune
tolerance synergizes with current anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 therapies. The primary impact of the proposal
will be mechanistic verification of SC-dependent maintenance of the immune tolerance – a major challenge
in the current treatment of advanced malignancies. We expect that our results will validate a novel
immunotherapy approach for melanoma based on targeting tumor-associated glia – an approach which will
likely be applicable to other types of cancer."

medical illnesses including cancer, diabetes mellitus, heart or renal failure, and acute or chronic infections. It is
linked to increased disability, morbidity, as well as mortality, afflicts millions of Americans, and accounts for tens
of billions of dollars in annual healthcare costs. Moreover, veterans are projected to have an increased
prevalence of muscle atrophy compared to the general population because of military service-related injuries
and medical conditions as well as their older age. Yet, there are no currently approved medical therapies for
muscle atrophy, and the molecular determinants that control muscle mass remain incompletely defined. Using
conditional genetic engineering, we have identified a surprising new role for the B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6)
transcriptional repressor to maintain muscle mass. Herein, we propose to comprehensively dissect the function
of BCL6 in muscle and its epigenomic regulation. In Aim 1, we will test the impact of BCL6 on muscle protein
synthesis and degradation, muscle mass, myofiber specification and metabolism, strength, and whole body
energy homeostasis. In Aim 2, we will define the genome-wide gene regulatory network for BCL6 and its
epigenomic, molecular, and biochemical mechanisms for controlling proteostasis. Together, these studies will
reveal new molecular insights and a potential therapeutic pathway to reduce the burden of skeletal muscle loss."

Coordination with Collaborators and Consultants by the ANC further amplifies the programmatic strengths of the Center. The
ANC will provide a supportive infrastructure to ensure accomplishment of all Center goals: 1) managing the project
financial and personnel resources; 2) facilitating coordination and integration of research Projects, Cores and Advisors;
3) ensuring quality improvement by monitoring of benchmark metrics and logistical optimization; 4) overseeing the

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central pathway regulating fertility.
Properly patterned GnRH release is required for fertility and is often disrupted in women with polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS). Hyperandrogenic PCOS affects ~8-10% of women. In these women, there is a persistent
high frequency of luteinizing hormone (LH), and likely GnRH, release. Prenatally androgenized (PNA) mice
have neuroendocrine phenotypes similar to women with PCOS, including high LH pulse frequency, and can be
used to study mechanisms of this increase. Pathophysiology similar to PCOS is being detected at younger
ages, suggesting the antecedents of this disorder may be developmentally programmed. In the previous work
from a different funding mechanism (NCTRI), we characterized the development of GnRH neuron activity and
GABA transmission to these cells, showing that PNA disrupts both parameters before puberty, and that PNA-
induced changes before and after puberty are different. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these
observations are largely unknown. Our working model to explain these findings is that 1) PNA alters the
biophysical properties of GnRH neurons and their afferents; 2) altered epigenetic programing at least in part
underlies these changes; 3) PNA increases excitatory GABA synaptic drive to GnRH neurons before puberty
and this increase continues in adults; 4) before puberty in PNA mice, GnRH neurons initiate intrinsic changes
to adapt to the increased GABA drive, and firing output is reduced; 5) developmental changes in PNA mice
lead to failure of these GnRH neuron adaptations, so that in PNA adults, increased GABA drive contributes to
increased GnRH neuron firing; 6) the increased neuroendocrine drive increases androgens, which are critical
to maintain neuroendocrine PNA phenotypes in adults. We will test this model in two aims. Aim 1 will identify
the mechanisms underlying prepubertal adaptation of GnRH neurons in PNA mice to increased GABA drive.
Aim 2 will characterize the epigenetic landscape in GnRH neurons during development, and changes induced
by PNA. The role of the ovary and androgen replacement in establishing and maintaining epigenetic changes
will also be assessed. Preliminary data indicate that GnRH neuron action potential firing, calcium currents and
potassium currents are all differentially regulated in prepubertal vs adult PNA mice compared to controls. To
complement the electrophysiology studies, we have adapted epigenetic profiling to libraries made from a few
hundred neurons and established fluorescent cell sorting protocols that yield sufficient numbers of enriched
GnRH neurons for these analyses. We are thus positioned to examine the molecular and biophysical
underpinnings of the functional changes of GnRH neurons observed in PNA mice. This work will provide
mechanistic insight currently lacking on the typical functional development of GnRH neurons through the
pubertal process, associated epigenetic changes, and how these parameters may be altered in
hyperandrogenic disorders; is not possible to obtain these insights from human studies."

other pathogens, possesses a peculiar host response pathobiology that explains its propensity to cause
prolonged critical illness. Importantly, SCRIPT’s model predicted the efficacy of an experimental pharmacologic
intervention in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia – the CRAC channel inhibitor Auxora. In this renewal, Super-SCRIPT
(SCRIPT2) will continue to leverage serial sampling of biological materials (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal
epithelium, blood) paired with cutting-edge multi-omics technologies and deep clinical phenotyping to develop
models of pneumonia pathogenesis which could augment clinical decision making. We used clinical and -omics
data collected and generated during the first cycle of this award to generate preliminary data for the renewal. We
discretized time in the ICU and related physiological measures on a per-day basis, similar to how physicians
view and treat patients with severe pneumonia in the ICU. Our novel approach overcomes a critical limitation in
the application of machine learning approaches to clinical data, which often do not take into account interventions
that can change the course of the disease and typically focus only on clinical state at presentation and ultimate
outcome, analogous to drawing a line between two points. We generated a low-dimensional interpretable latent
space model of clinical states in patients with severe pneumonia. We show that transitions between these clinical
states are different in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and other types of pneumonia. By projecting results
of -omics assays onto this clinical latent space, we propose to identify biomarkers associated with favorable and
unfavorable clinical transitions. We will use this latent space model of severe pneumonia to test the hypothesis
that machine learning approaches can identify interpretable cellular and molecular biomarkers of
favorable and unfavorable clinical transitions during the clinical course of severe pneumonia. We will
test this hypothesis in three interrelated Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To generate an interpretable latent space model of clinical states and transitions (disease
trajectories) in patients with severe pneumonia using data collected within SCRIPT2.
Aim 2: To identify cellular and molecular biomarkers and clinical interventions predictive of transitions
between unfavorable and favorable clinical states in patients with severe pneumonia using data
collected within SCRIPT2.
Aim 3: To generalize models generated using SCRIPT2 to external datasets."
10757687,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 20%–30% of persons with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) use opioids for pain
management. In recent years, the prevalence of long-term opioid treatment (LTOT) has increased in patients
with musculoskeletal pain. Particularly concerning are the significant LTOT-related risks (e.g., opioid-related
abuse, overdose, and death). Physical therapy (PT) is a common nonpharmacologic management strategy
recommended for CMP. The majority of patients in outpatient PT clinics have musculoskeletal pain, and at
least one in three use prescription opioids. Combining exercise-based interventions with mindfulness practices
is effective for patients with CMP, and engaging in mindfulness practices leads to a reduction in opioid dose in
patients with chronic pain and LTOT. However, the impact of physical therapist-led mindfulness-based
interventions integrated with evidence-based PT (I-EPT) to manage patients with CMP and LTOT has not been
elucidated. Our overall goal is to develop effective, scalable strategies to manage patients with CMP and LTOT
in the PT setting. In response to the FOA PAR-21-241 for multisite feasibility clinical trials of mind and body
interventions, this proposal focuses on evaluating the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered clinical trial that
tests I-EPT. In preparation for a fully-powered trial, we propose a before and after multi-site feasibility clinical
trial conducted in PT clinics located in an academic health care system in the Intermountain West and PT
clinics that are part of a rehabilitation system in the Southeast. We will evaluate the feasibility of providing I-
EPT to patients with CMP and LTOT by carrying 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1: Refine and manualize the I-EPT
treatment protocol for patients with CMP and LTOT. Our approach will use semi-structured interviews of
patients and physical therapists to refine I-EPT. Using the results of the semi-structured interviews, we will
manualize the I-EPT treatment protocol. Aim 2: Evaluate different intensities of a physical therapist training
programs for the refined I-EPT treatment protocol. Our approach will be to randomize physical therapists 2:1 to
training and no training groups. The training group will include a high intensity training (HighIT) program and a
low intensity training program (LowIT). Following the training programs, we will examine immediate post-
training competency in providing I-EPT using a standardized patient simulation. Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility
of the I-EPT intervention across domains of the RE-AIM framework. Our approach will be to pilot test the
refined I-EPT treatment protocol in patients managed by physical therapists randomized to training and no
training arms. We will use mixed-methods to assess feasibility outcomes. The results of this feasibility study
will inform the design and execution of our planned fully powered clinical trial and could lead to improved
management of patients with CPM and LTOT."
10744241,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial pathogens modulate the physiology of human cells by secreting effector proteins that assist pathogen
immune evasion and proliferation. The diverse repertoire of secreted pathogenic effectors re-wire an array of
cellular signaling pathways that are at the core of host cell function. One class of these effector proteins enter
the human cell nucleus and directly modulate transcriptional programs of the host by altering our epigenetic
code. These so-called epigenetic “nucleomodulins” represent an important aspect of host-pathogen interaction,
however very little is understood about how these effectors might interact with and sense the epigenetic
landscape of the host cell during infection. One of the most well-studied epigenetic nucleomodulins is RomA, a
histone lysine methyltransferase from Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires Disease.
RomA mono-, di- and tri-methylates histone H3K14, silences the expression of host cell immune response
genes and enables efficient replication of L. pneumophila inside the host cytoplasm. RomA contains several
domains that are conserved in eukaryotic chromatin-binding proteins, suggesting that its H3K14 methylation
activity may be regulated by interacting with histone modifications of the host. In eukaryotes, the phenomenon
where an existing histone modification controls the recognition or deposition of another is called histone
modification crosstalk. These histone crosstalk mechanisms underlie the complex regulation of transcription
and genome architecture in eukaryotes. However, there are no known examples of a bacterial pathogen that
can interpret human histone modifications through histone crosstalk and alter the human epigenome. Such an
observation would greatly expand our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during infection. In this R21
proposal, we will use the L. pneumophila effector RomA as a model to establish if pathogenic bacteria can
interact with and interpret existing histone modifications through crosstalk mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will
subject RomA and individual RomA domains to a comprehensive three-part screen to establish if any human
histone modifications can bind to RomA or regulate its catalytic activity. Then, in Aim 2 we will establish a cryo-
EM screening workflow to identify optimal substrates and freezing conditions that will be necessary to
determine a structure of RomA bound to its preferred substrate nucleosome."
10739815,"Abstract: Clostridioides difficile is the most prevalent cause of hospital associated infections
(HAIs). As an obligately anaerobic pathogen, C. difficile can consume diverse carbon sources to
support gut colonization and infection. In particular, glycolytic and Stickland amino acid
fermentation pathways have been shown to support rapid growth, a finding that also occurs after
antibiotic treatment elevates availability of these nutrient sources by removing competitive
commensal species. However, the metabolic pathways of obligately anaerobic bacteria remain
ill-defined, limiting capacity to identify preventive and therapeutic interventions that target C.
difficile’s core physiology. To address these limitations, we will employ carbon-13 (13C) NMR of
C. difficile’s dynamic metabolism to inform a genome-scale metabolic model and clearly define
metabolic integration points among energy-generating glycolytic and amino acid fermentation
pathways. Findings will be evaluated in targeted genetic mutants and with combinations of
fermentable carbon sources to evaluate their impact on pathogen growth and virulence."
10864923,"This is a competitive renewal for a multidisciplinary CardioVascular Surgery Training Program (CVSTP) that
is currently in its 20th year. The number of cardiovascular surgeons conducting research is diminishing,
and there is a need to provide quality research training for aspiring academic cardiovascular surgeons.
Thus, the goal of the CVSTP is to provide surgery residents with training in basic, translational or clinical
research to foster their development into independent surgeon-scientists. The Department of Surgery, together
with the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center and other departments within the School of
Medicine, propose to continue and enhance a rigorous and successful research training program in the
disciplines of vascular or end-organ function following transplantation or surgery. NIH support is requested
for six MD postdocs (surgery residents) per year, each for a 2-year period. Trainees will choose between a
basic research track or a clinical research track, which provide clear, defined options available to meet
their interests and training needs. Administratively, the program will be led by PD team comprised of a senior
surgeon-scientist and a senior basic scientist. Program oversight will be provided by a Steering Committee (for
overall program function), individual Mentoring Committees (function like a thesis committee for each trainee),
and an External Advisory Board. The program is composed of four areas: 1) A mentor-guided research
experience is at the heart of the program where trainees work on a broad range of basic or clinical research
topics in a collaborative atmosphere. Trainees learn to use a variety of approaches to rigorously test
hypotheses. 2) Didactic training is provided in life skills, responsible conduct of research, epidemiology and
vascular biology. Trainees in the basic research track can pursue a Certificate in Public Health Sciences or a
PhD degree. Trainees in the clinical research track can matriculate in either a Master of Public Health
(MPH) or a Master of Science in Clinical Research (MS-CR) program. 3) Required activities for trainees
include a research seminar series, presentations at monthly research-in-progress meetings, an annual
Department of Surgery “Resident Research Day”, presentations at national conferences, and publications. 4)
Evaluation of trainee progress, essential to meet the evolving needs of future trainees, will be performed using
a multi-layered mechanism, including individual development plans, to ensure the success of the training
experience. Trainees will also evaluate both mentors and the CVSTP. Strengths of the program include:
a) a team of 21 experienced, multidisciplinary faculty preceptors with extramural funding, b) strong
collaborative links among faculty conducting basic and/or clinical research in thoracic and cardiovascular
medicine, c) comprehensive course offerings and degree options, and d) a wide variety of research
opportunities available to trainees such as the Surgery Innovation Center and data sciences. Our CVSTP aims
to continue to produce the next generation of highly trained academic cardiovascular surgeon-scientists
devoted to understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of cardiovascular injury and disease."
10821318,"CAPES OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Significance: Recently, we have seen massive growth in availability of empirically supported technologies
enabling suicide risk identification, monitoring, and prevention in healthcare settings. However, our knowledge
of effective, efficient strategies to translate these technologies into clinical practice is weak. As a result, these
technologies are not being optimally deployed to prevent suicides. The Center for Accelerating Practices
to End Suicide through Technology Translation (
CAPES
) will bridge this research-to-practice gap.
 Investigators: CAPES transdisciplinary Faculty, Advisors, and Consultants have extensive expertise in the
disciplines required to successfully support the CAPES mission and its individual projects, producing synergistic
insights and discovery. Combined, the team has over 1,000 high-impact publications in fields relevant to or
directly studying the intersection of suicide prevention, implementation science, digital health technology
development and translation to practice, health disparities, study design and analysis, and healthcare systems-
based change. This scientific depth will be accompanied by longitudinal engagement of diverse stakeholders.
 Innovation: CAPES will be the first NIMH center focused on accelerating evidence-based suicide care by
leveraging technology solutions across multiple healthcare settings. Further, it will leverage innovations in
implementation science, person-centered design, hybrid clinical trial design, technology-related economics
evaluations, business development, and ethics to maximize scientific and public health impact.
 Approach: The CAPES Administrative Core will collaborate with the Methods Core to maximize the Center’s
impact by creating synergy; prioritizing evidence-based, scalable technologies for study; creating relevance
across multiple settings and diverse patient populations; leveraging the Zero Suicide framework to align with
priorities of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and NIMH; and fostering business development
and technology transfer to help ensure successful public dissemination, adoption, and sustainability.
 Environment: UMass and Worcester Polytechnic Institute have an established history of successfully
carrying out collaborative studies and are perfectly situated to support this Center. Their networked capabilities,
combined with other academic, health system, business, and community partners, provide layered,
complementary resource access for clinical care improvement, technology development, technology transfer
from research settings to clinical use, and widespread dissemination of CAPES resources.
 Impact: Led by accomplished investigators with access to powerful resources, CAPES will be ideally situated
to answer the critical research questions posed in this proposal and reach many diverse settings and patient
populations. CAPES innovative embrace of evidence-based suicide care technologies, combined with a strong
focus on Zero Suicide alignment, implementation science advances, technology transfer, and multi-channel
dissemination, position it for transformational impact on suicide prevention in healthcare settings."

10809580,"ABSTRACT
Genetic differences among individuals ultimately trace to single nucleotide polymorphisms, the majority of
which affect traits, including disease susceptibility, by influencing the expression of nearby genes. Over the
past decade, tens of thousands of loci of this type have been mapped to what are called credible intervals,
namely sets of anywhere from a handful to over one hundred polymorphisms that have similar statistical
signals. The next step is to resolve the identities of the causal variant(s) within these credible intervals.
Similarly, there is a parallel pressing need to validate that de novo and ultra-rare variants in the promoter of
a gene thought to contribute to a congenital abnormality actually disrupt expression of the gene. This project
proposes a systematic effort to fine map causal variants for hundreds of genes that influence autoimmune
and other immune conditions. It utilizes a combination of genome engineering and single cell genomics, in
a recently developed assay called expression CROP-seq, or eCROPseq. The idea is to knock out each of
the variants in a credible interval with a pool of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs, each targeting one SNP for
microdeletion of mutation, and taken up by about 100 cells. The expression of the gene in those cells is then
compared with the expression in all other cells that receive different guide RNAs in the same experiment.
Aim 1 is to use eCROPseq to identify causal variants in up to 600 credible intervals associated with 350
immune loci, measured in both a myeloid (HL60) and lymphoid (Jurkat) cell line. Aim 2 is to perform a similar
analysis of up to 500 rare variants in the promoter regions of these genes to evaluate whether new mutations
can cause extreme levels of aberrant gene expression. With these results in hand, Aim 3 utilizes a more
precise genome editing tool, search-and-replace CRISPR (also known as prime editing) to substitute one
allele for another instead of just evaluating mutations. Then Aim 4 asks whether the effects observed in the
cell lines are also seen in primary T cells from eight different people, and whether the magnitude of effect
differs among people. Collectively the proposed experiments will systematically map the causal regulatory
variants for hundreds of autoimmune genes, and establish a tool that should be readily adapted by even
small labs to test the function of new genome-wide associations."
10763369,"ABSTRACT
The aim of the project is to determine the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of HNF1a-AS1 and
HNF4a-AS1 in the regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene expression. Drug-metabolizing CYP
enzymes are responsible for therapeutic outcomes of 60-70% drugs. Understanding all key factors in
the regulation of expression of the CYP enzymes is critical to predict outcomes of drug therapy.
Transcription factors (TFs) of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (HNF1a), 4a (HNF4a), pregnane X receptor
(PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) are the key factors. After binding to their response
elements, the TFs facilitate transcriptional regulation through alterations of histone modification status
of the CYP genes, the major epigenetic mechanism. A remaining question is how the TFs trigger
alterations of histone modifications to facilitate the regulation of CYP expression. lncRNAs may be the
key components. Increasing evidence has shown that antisense lncRNAs next to TFs on chromosomal
locations are involved in the functions of the TFs in regulation of gene expression. We identified two
lncRNAs next to the TFs of HNF1a and HNF4a, which are HNF1a-AS1 and HNF4a-AS1. Several
fundamental challenge questions need to be addressed. (1) Whether HNF1a-AS1 and HNF4a-AS1 are
the two key factors in maintaining homeostasis of P450 enzymes in liver in a dynamic process, such as
drug induction, through enhancing by HNF1a-AS1 or repressing by HNF4a-AS1 in the transcriptional
regulation of P450 gene expression? (2) Whether HNF1a-AS1 and HNF4a-AS1 are the two key factors
in sensitizing susceptibility of drug induced liver injury (DILI) and following process of liver regeneration?
(3) How HNF1a-AS1 and HNF4a-AS1 participate in the regulation of P450 gene expression, directly or
indirectly through the regulation of PXR or CAR by alteration of histone modifications? These
fundamental questions are so critical for deeply understanding molecular mechanisms in the regulation
of CYP-mediated drug metabolism and DILI. In the past five years, we have determined the role of
lncRNAs in drug metabolism. Our recent progress has placed us into an appropriate position to provide
answers to these fundamental questions. We have developed a comprehensive plan to address these
challenge questions with both in vitro and in vivo models in the next five years. After completion of the
proposed studies, we expect to provide answers to address the challenge questions. The proposed
work will elucidate the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by lncRNAs that control homeostasis of drug-
metabolizing CYP expression in a positive and negative feedback loop after exposure to drugs. The
proposed work will determine the roles of lncRNAs in P450-mediated drug metabolism and susceptibility
to DILI. The generated knowledge will help to identify novel key factors for predicting therapeutic efficacy
and DILI."
10927195,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 4 (SCHEUERMANN)
Smoking is one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States. Pregnant women who smoke expose
themselves and their babies to a myriad of known carcinogens and are at risk for poor pregnancy outcomes.
Currently, smoking rates among pregnant women are 8% with even higher smoking prevalence among low-
income women. Twelve percent of pregnant women enrolled in The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) smoke. Low-income pregnant women are also less likely to quit. Even
though guidelines recommend treating tobacco use among pregnant women, most pregnant smokers do not
receive smoking cessation counseling and only one in 10 receive referrals to cessation services or follow-up
care. WIC clinics are an ideal venue for initiating smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women. WIC
serves approximately 40% of pregnant women and clinics have existing data systems to routinely document
tobacco use. Effective smoking cessation interventions have been developed for pregnant women but quit
rates are modest. Only a few intervention studies have focused on pregnant women enrolled in WIC, and one
achieved significant, biochemically verified quit rates. Efforts to implement smoking cessation interventions
programs in WIC show low sustainment and barriers such as time constraints among WIC staff and lack of
referral resources and educational materials. The goal of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel
smoking cessation intervention for initiation in WIC clinics that enhances text message cessation support with
remotely delivered incentives. Developing an effective and scalable intervention for the WIC context could
improve health equity for low-income women. We will use implementation science in planning our intervention
by conducting formative studies to ensure feasibility and acceptability among WIC stakeholders. First, we will
conduct interviews to determine end-user perspectives on the intervention and implementation strategies and
identify adaptations to the intervention prior to implementation, using the FRAME framework to catalogue
adaptations. In Aim 1, we will interview 15 pregnant current and recent smokers including both English and
Spanish-speaking women enrolled in WIC. In Aim 2, we will conduct 12- 15 interviews with WIC staff key
informants to elicit suggestions and feedback for modifications to the intervention and implementation plan.
Based on stakeholder input (Aims 1 and 2), we will adapt our intervention and finalize our implementation plan
and toolkit for our pilot trial (Aim 3). In our pilot trial we will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary effectiveness of the text message + incentives intervention with a sample of 50 pregnant smokers
enrolled in WIC. We will employ a randomized controlled trial design with a text-message only control. This
research program will impact the field by developing a scalable intervention for widely used programs reaching
a large proportion of low-income pregnant women."

Background: The U.S. has the highest rate of maternal deaths in the developed world and over 60% of
maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable. Preeclampsia, a disorder of pregnancy characterized by
hypertension and proteinuria, is a top preventable cause of maternal death and an important driver of health
disparities in the U.S. Chronic hypertension, a major risk factor for preeclampsia, is estimated to be present in
3% to 5% of all pregnancies but is 60% more prevalent in Black women. Black women carry a 3- to 4-fold
greater risk, compared to Whites, of dying from preeclampsia. Research suggest that women at high-risk for
preeclampsia recieve 81 to 150 mg of aspirin and counseling on and self-monitor their high blood pressure
between 11-16 until 36 weeks of gestation. The brief duration of typical prenatal visits (10 minutes on average)
hinders the provider’s ability to deliver evidence-based preeclampsia education and counseling. To date,
current research does not, moreover, take advantage of innovative and evidence-based models of prenatal
care and hypertension control that have proven feasible for providers and patients. Thus, there is a critical
need to implement and deliver guideline-consistent preeclampsia prevention in a sustainable model that
removes barriers to care for at-risk Black women. Study Design: The long-term goal of this project is to reduce
needless preeclampsia and preeclampsia-related deaths among Black pregnant women by increasing access
to evidence-based care. The objective of this study is to refine and pilot test a novel intervention that is
designed to address patient and provider barriers to preeclampsia prevention. The intervention, Centering HER
(Health, Empowerment, and Reproduction), combines a well-established and effective group prenatal care
model—Centering Pregnancy—with a promising telemedicine-based hypertension control program—Take
Control of Your Blood Pressure. To meet our study objective, the study proposes the following specific aims: 1)
To gain end-user input on the feasibility and acceptability of Centering HER, 2) To pilot the revised Centering
HER and collect feasibility and intermediate outcome data, and 3) To determine the effectiveness of Centering
HER to improve blood pressure monitoring, aspirin adherence, and implementation measures. Potential
Impact: The successful completion of the aims will be important to address the cornerstones of preeclampsia
prevention –prenatal care, medication adherence, and blood pressure monitoring and reduce maternal health
disparities. If efficacious, Centering HER may be a low cost, sustainable, translatable option ot prevent
preeclampsia in at-risk populations."
10841476,"Central nervous system (CNS) metabolism and neuronal excitability are interdependent, and so CNS
metabolism is the biochemical basis of cognition, memory, and behavior. Dysregulation of CNS is implicated in
numerous disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and brain injury, but the
mechanistic connections between CNS metabolism and disease are poorly understood. The University of
Kentucky (UK) College of Medicine has made significant investments over the last few years in investigators
with metabolic and metabolomics expertise and instrumentation to support their research efforts, which has
enhanced existing strengths in neuroscience, cancer, cardiovascular, and diabetes and obesity research.
Thus, UK proposes to establish a unique multidisciplinary Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)
on CNS Metabolism (CNS-Met) as a strategically designed, sustainable framework that promotes leading-edge
research focused on the role of metabolic mediators of brain function and disease. The proposed
interdisciplinary center leverages highly specialized expertise in glucose biology, neuronal signaling,
mitochondrial metabolism, systems neuroscience, and data sciences as well as the presence of advanced
metabolomics and imaging capabilities to create an integrated research framework focused on CNS
metabolism. The overarching goals are to strengthen UK’s neuroscience research enterprise by providing a
thematically focused and sustainable multidisciplinary infrastructure dedicated to defining the contribution of
metabolism to CNS function and neurological diseases and to use this novel platform to develop promising and
highly-skilled, early-stage investigators in an exciting and impactful area of CNS research. To accomplish
these goals, we will meet four specific aims: (1) Develop a critical mass of funded investigators with research
programs directly related to the COBRE’s unifying theme; (2) provide strong team-based mentoring combining
basic and clinical expertise; (3) recruit new investigators to the COBRE in multidisciplinary areas of neurologic
dysfunction through pilot project grant and recruitment of junior Research Project Leaders; and (4) create
synergy among research projects via critical links to strong research centers and core facilities at UK, including
existing COBREs. Emerging synergies will be developed through three research projects, an Administrative
Core, a critical research core in Metabolomics, all linked by strong biostatistics/bioinformatics support, all of
which are critical to the proposed studies and will contribute to the development of institutional resources. The
scientific focus of the three research projects are brain metabolism interactions with neurological disease,
spanning basic and translational perspectives. This concentration of multidisciplinary expertise focused on
widely recognized yet understudied metabolic mechanisms of neurological diseases promises significant new
understandings of CNS metabolism overall. The CNS-Met will create a critical mass of skilled scientists who
are well equipped to lead a sustainable research center focused on CNS metabolism into the future."
10672455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States, heat is responsible for more fatalities than any other type of weather and the burden of
morbidity and mortality attributable to heat is growing. Southern communities, in particular, are expected to
suffer some of the greatest consequences of extreme heat in the coming decades. New Orleans, Louisiana,
with over a quarter of its population living in poverty, is uniquely sensitive to the health risks from rising
temperatures. Quantifying the public health burden of heat is critical to dedicating public health and
infrastructure resources that are desperately needed to curb this growing societal problem in New Orleans.
However, little is known about the relationship between heat exposure and health outcomes (i.e., the heat
metric or threshold that is most predictive of morbidity and mortality) within New Orleans. Further, because this
relationship can be modified by local microclimate, population and housing characteristics, individual behavior
patterns, and other neighborhood-level factors, locally-specific data and analysis is needed to inform policy
action. In the proposed project, we will (1) determine which exposure metrics, thresholds, and duration predict
heat-related morbidity and mortality within New Orleans and use this to estimate the current public health
burden of heat exposure to children, adults, and the elderly; (2) identify individual and neighborhood
characteristics that increase vulnerability to heat-related morbidity and mortality and create an empirically-
based heat-health vulnerability index for New Orleans; (3) collect and analyze citizen-sourced measurements
of indoor and outdoor thermal environments, social media observations, and “real time” assessments of heat,
risk perceptions, and health symptoms through ecological momentary assessment to further characterize
microclimates and human behaviors that may lead to increased heat vulnerability; and (4) in collaboration with
a community advisory panel, develop city-wide recommendations for improved heat-health preparedness in
New Orleans and translate our findings to other communities with the production of a toolkit on heat-health
preparedness. Key innovations of this project include the use of novel data sources and methods, such as fine-
scale gridded climate data and citizen-sourced measurements of temperature and humidity, to more accurately
characterize personal heat exposure; a comprehensive assessment of the burden of heat across the life
course to include symptoms of heat stress, sleep quality, hospitalizations, and mortality ascertained through a
combination of healthcare claims analysis and ecological momentary assessment; and a dedication to
community engagement and research translation throughout the life of the project to ensure that research
results lead to policy action and public health improvements."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, affecting 33.5 million people globally with a
growing prevalence. AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including 20% of all
strokes, 33% of hospitalizations related to cardiac arrhythmias, and a two-fold increase in risk of
death. To reduce AF-associated risks such as stroke, it is important to be able to diagnose AF early in
the AF trajectory when it is asymptomatic and paroxysmal in order to initiate effective stroke
prevention interventions including anticoagulation. Unfortunately, it is estimated that 700,000 people
in the USA may have previously unknown AF, and newly detected AF at the time of stroke was found
among 18% of AF-associated stroke incidents. Plethysmography (PPG) measures pulsatile blood
volume changes and is available in up to 71% of consumer wearables. Because of this unmatched
availability, PPG-based AF detection is ideally poised to enable low-cost, long-term, and continuous
AF monitoring at scale. However, modest performance of PPG-based AF detection when PPG
signals do not have perfect signal quality remains a critical impediment to fully realize its potential as
an AF-monitoring tool at scale. The proposed study aims to overcome this challenge by pursuing the
following aims: 1) design, develop, and validate a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture that
integrate PPG signal quality assessment with AF detection to accurately detect AF even for signals
with imperfect signal quality; 2) validate and test further personalization of the proposed DNN using
prospective data from post stroke patients to be collected in ambulatory settings; 3) develop and
validate interpretable EHR-data driven machine learning approaches to identify patients with elevated
risk of AF for whom PPG-based AF monitoring can be most likely beneficial."

The major goals of this proposal are to: 1) Determine whether hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a risk factor for
developing inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 2) Evaluate whether
preexisting hip OA progresses more quickly in patients exposed to ICIs as compared to other patients with
cancer. ICIs have improved outcomes for a variety of malignancies, but also cause immune related adverse
events (irAEs). ICI-induced IA is the irAE most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA
causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. Despite its impact
on patients, clinical risk factors for ICI-induced IA are not well defined. The proposed project will utilize a cohort
of well characterized patients treated with ICIs and CT imaging already obtained as a part of cancer clinical
care to address the question of whether hip OA is a risk factor for development of ICI-induced IA. This project
tests the hypothesis that an abnormality in the microenvironment of one joint can lead to a systemic
inflammatory response that in turn affects other joints in the setting of immune activation by ICIs.
Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy,
differential monitoring, and potentially allow for trials of preventive therapies. The proposal will also evaluate
progression of hip OA with serial CT scans in patients treated with ICIs and other cancer patients treated with
different therapies. Patients on ICI therapy can experience an increase of symptoms of preexisting OA
sometimes termed “activated OA”. Whether this increase in symptoms is related to increased progression on
imaging is unknown. This study will determine if progressive OA is likely to be a major cause of morbidity and
functional limitation in long-term survivors from cancer treated with ICIs. In sum, the proposal will answer
important questions about the relationship between ICI therapy and OA using radiographic data from CT scans
obtained through routine clinical care, thereby generating no additional cost or radiation exposure for patients."

Reductive-oxidative (redox) imbalance in nigrostriatal neurons has been indicated as an important cause of
nigrostriatal degeneration in familial and idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). While it is generally assumed that
the oxidative damage seen in PD derives from dysfunctional mitochondrial electron transport chain, there is
growing consensus that NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (NOX2) may be important and, in some cellular systems, the
two appear intimately related in a redox regulatory pathway recently termed “ROS-induced ROS production”
(RIRP). However, the relevance of NOX2 in PD pathogenesis remains underexplored. Additionally, the in-situ
detection of NOX2 activity state has been difficult to assess. Using a novel histological proximity ligation (PL)
assay to detect NOX2 activation state with excellent cellular resolution, our preliminary findings address the
relevance of NOX2 activity, in idiopathic PD and in PD animal models of parkinsonism.
Our preliminary studies reveal that NOX2 can be activated by mitochondrially-derived ROS in a RIRP manner,
which serves to greatly amplify ROS production. The resultant NOX2 activity is necessary and sufficient to both
activate wildtype LRRK2 and to cause accumulation and oxidative post-translational modifications of α-synuclein
(4-HNE-α-syn and NO-α-syn). The NOX2-activated LRRK2 kinase activity leads to endo-lysosomal and
autophagic defects and decreased degradation of toxic species of α-synuclein, such as pSer129-α-synuclein. In
this way, NOX2 activity both drives the formation and inhibits the disposal of toxic forms of α-synuclein. In turn,
as shown in previous work, these forms of α-synuclein bind to mitochondrial TOM20, blocking protein import and
leading to mitochondrial functional alterations and relative increased ROS production. Thus, there appears to be
a feedforward cycle, in which NOX2 plays an essential amplification role in PD pathogenesis.
However, other NOXs, including isoforms 1 and 4 – also highly expressed in brain - might contribute somehow
to this pathogenic process. In this context, the current proposal is designed to further explore and define the
exclusive role of NOX2 in PD.
Positive outcomes demonstrating the relevance of NOX2 in PD pathogenesis and the efficacy of NOX2-directed
therapies using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), will reveal potential therapeutic strategies for
neuroprotection and ameliorate the PD-related movement disorder. As such, this project has compelling practical
significance for PD therapeutics."

The cell and tissue tropism of viruses is defined as the capacity of a virus to infect
specific cells and tissues and is determined by both viral and cellular factors. An
important factor for initiation of infection is cell entry, which is dependent on the ability of
the virus to dock with its cognitive receptor. A growing understanding of species
differences in ACE2 structure and, perhaps more importantly, in tissue specific patterns
of expression has underscored the potential limitations in the use of mouse models for
the study of disease pathogenesis of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 that rely on
ACE2 for cellular entry. We propose to implement a strategy for the rapid generation of
mouse models in which human ACE2 expression is limited to individual or multiple
airway epithelial populations. Using these lines, we will examine the impact of the
cellular pattern of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract on the sequence of events
following exposure to SARS-CoV2 coronavirus."
10884160,"The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism by which mortalin is upregulated in thyroid cancer,
determine the role of mortalin for tumor cell metabolism, and evaluate the potential of the metabolic
processes that mortalin regulates as a therapeutic target. Metabolic reprogramming in the processes of
energy and building block production is critical for tumor development and maintenance, but is associated
with the risk of a lethal metabolic stress. It is therefore conceivable that malignant tumor cells might have
successfully developed a protective mechanism in this context. If identified, such a mechanism may be
targeted to unleash a death signal in tumor cells. We previously demonstrated that depletion of mortalin
(GRP75/HSPA9), a molecular chaperone in the HSP70 family, causes lethal bioenergetic and oxidative
stress in tumor cells, proposing that mortalin upregulation is a mechanism to protect tumor cells from a
metabolic stress. Current understanding of the role of mortalin and its regulation is very limited in thyroid
cancer, which is a metabolically active tumor. Our analysis of the TCGA RNAseq dataset revealed that a
thyroid cancer-specific correlation exists between mortalin and ESRRA, an orphan transcription factor that
regulates metabolic reprogramming. In our preliminary study, ESRRA depletion downregulated mortalin
expression and induced cell death in different thyroid tumor cell lines, while this lethality was substantially
abrogated by mortalin overexpression. These data led us to hypothesize that ESRRA is a tumor type-
specific transcription factor that mediates mortalin overexpression in thyroid cancer and that mortalin is
necessary for ESRRA to regulate thyroid tumor cell metabolism. Our metabolome analysis suggests that
mortalin knockdown markedly depletes acetyl-CoA and its precursors in the context of the reductive TCA
cycle, while increasing lactate and glucose. Moreover, depletion of ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), the enzyme
that synthesizes cytosolic acetyl-CoA from citrate produced through the reductive TCA cycle, induced
similar lethal effects as mortalin depletion whereas overexpression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the
enzyme that produces pyruvate to often facilitate the Warburg effect, conferred tolerance to mortalin
depletion. Based upon these data, we further hypothesize that mortalin regulates the interplay between the
Warburg effect and the reductive TCA cycle to facilitate cytosolic acetyl-CoA production. By extension, we
predict that ACL inhibition is a promising strategy to suppress mortalin-dependent thyroid tumor cells and
can be effectively combined with glycolysis inhibition. To test these hypotheses, Aim 1 will determine how
ESRRA regulates mortalin transcription and examine their correlated expression and functional relationship
in different thyroid tumor subtypes. Aim 2 will determine how mortalin regulates the interplay between
glycolysis and the reductive TCA cycle to facilitate cytosolic acetyl-CoA production. Aim 3 will determine
whether ACL is an effective target to suppress mortalin-dependent thyroid tumor cells in vitro and in vivo."
10788319,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is a leading cause of death in young adults, especially among those with borderline personality disorder
(BPD), of whom up to 10% of whom die by suicide. BPD is hallmarked by relationship threat sensitivity (e.g.,
hyperreactivity to perceived rejection) which predicts conflict in romantic relationships, and often immediately
precedes suicide-related events (SREs; suicide ideation, suicide-related communication, preparatory behaviors,
attempts). While most theories of suicide explicitly underscore the importance of relationship factors however,
suicide research has focused almost exclusively on the suicidal individual and failed to consider the dyadic
context in which the suicidal individual exists. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to identify dyadic
interpersonal mechanisms within romantic relationships of high-suicide-risk young adults that exacerbate and
maintain suicide risk. We will test a dyadic model of suicide risk whereby multimodal indices of emotional
reactivity and problematic communication during dyadic conflict function to increase and maintain risk for SREs
over time. To achieve this goal, we will recruit 168 romantic couples (ages 18-35) in which at least one member
has had recent SREs and is thus at high risk for suicide. We will stratify the sample to ensure a full range of
relationship threat sensitivity and BPD severity, and these distal risk factors will be examined as predictors and
moderators of all hypothesized effects. Participants will complete a baseline laboratory assessment including a
laboratory-based dyadic conflict discussion task and a 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol
with continuous ambulatory psychophysiology and brief samples of audio recordings. Additionally, dyads will
complete three follow-up assessments of SREs and psychosocial functioning at 4-, 8- and 12-months post-
baseline. Our specific aims are to: 1) Examine interdependent associations between emotional reactivity and
problematic communication in romantic dyads with suicide risk; 2) Investigate whether within-individual and
dyadic patterns of emotional reactivity and problematic communication predict proximal increases (over hours,
days) in SREs; and 3) Assess whether emotional reactivity and problematic communication following SREs
functions to reinforce future SREs and predict worsening trajectories of suicide risk and psychosocial functioning.
Findings from this study will lead to improved assessment tools, identify novel couples-based intervention
targets, and inform the development of evidence-based strategies to reduce suicide risk and psychosocial
impairment in vulnerable individuals."
10915406,"Addiction to smoked tobacco and its many comorbid diseases – from cancer to COPD – have a massive
global impact. Although we have deep insights into brain circuits that influence addiction, we understand much
less about the genetic variants responsible for the high level of individual variability in the risk for addiction to
smoked tobacco and its principal psychoactive agent, nicotine. A large fraction of the vulnerability to initially
smoke cigarettes in adolescence and to relapse in adults is due to heritable genetic differences. In response to
NIDA PAR-21-244, this U01 is focused on discovering and understanding these complex genetic and molecular
factors, using a powerful new resource – the hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP). The HRDP is unique in that it
integrates: 1. A very high level of genetic diversity similar to that of admixed human populations; 2. Ways to
control and change drug exposures and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug inter-
actions; 3. Ways to integrate a full quantitative ""addictome"" of genetic, genomic, and molecular data that can
be used to promote the mechanistic development of Precision Medicine. The HRDP consists of 91 different,
fully isogenic rats, both inbred and F1 hybrids (used for diallel crosses): all are ""open access"" and available to
study facets of addiction. We have 3 aims: Aim 1. Beginning in adolescence, we will collect behavioral data
from the HRDP using our established limited access operant model of nicotine intravenous self-administration
(IVSA), which will be followed by an extended access model. By juxtaposing these two models, we emulate the
initial phase of limited, episodic smoking during adolescence, and the subsequent persistent, habitual smoking,
which leads to nicotine dependence. Our experimental design is sex-balanced and interleaved to minimize batch
effects; we quantify nicotine intake, motivation for nicotine, withdrawal severity, prolongation of seeking despite
lack of reinforcement, and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking; Aim 2. We generate telomere-to-telomere
(T2T) genome assemblies of key strains of the HRDP and construct a rat pangenome. We use the sequencing
methods established for the human T2T assembly, based on the highly accurate Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)
HiFi long-read (20kb) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) ultralong (>100 kb) data; Aim 3. We use the pangenome for
improved genotyping and QTL mapping. Human genomic studies have shown that pangenomes reduce genomic
""dark matter"" – greatly improving genotyping. We will map gene loci for each nicotine-dependent behavior and
associated phenome networks and evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes by comparison to hu-
man GWAS. Combining rat models of human smoking, advanced long read genome sequencing, T2T assemblies
and pangenomics, we will accurately define high impact genetic variants and molecular networks associated with
nicotine motivated behavior that models the key stages of human smoking."

We recently demonstrated that dorsolateral striatum fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are necessary for
compulsive alcohol drinking, which is a cardinal feature of alcohol use disorder. This proposal seeks to
understand the impact of ethanol on this critical interneuron population at molecular, neural circuit, and
behavioral levels to advance novel therapeutic strategies targeting compulsive alcohol use. While chronic
intermittent ethanol exposure exerts little effect on excitatory inputs to FSIs and FSI intrinsic excitability, it
dramatically downregulates inhibitory synaptic control of FSIs – positioning FSIs to activate without regulation
to underlie pathological compulsive drinking behavior. Our substantial preliminary data points to a framework
wherein ethanol acutely potentiates GABAergic input to FSIs and, following repeated intermittent exposure to
ethanol, GABAergic inputs are homeostatically downregulated by a degradation of the extracellular matrix that
surrounds FSIs, the so-called perineuronal nets that stabilize inhibitory input onto FSIs. Thus, we herein
hypothesize that this dramatic loss of GABAergic input to FSIs is mediated by a degradation of perineuronal
nets. This will be tested with three interrelated yet fully independent experimental aims using cutting-edge
approaches. Aim 1 will examine circuit-specific synaptic mechanisms governing the acute ethanol potentiation
of GABAergic input to FSIs using molecular tools and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Aim 2 will
determine the fate of GABAergic inputs to FSIs that are downregulated by chronic intermittent ethanol using a
suite of advance cellular and molecular imaging techniques. Aim 3 will explore the causal interaction of acute
ethanol potentiation of GABAergic input and the perineuronal net-mediated downregulation of these inputs
following chronic intermittent ethanol exposure using a powerful combination of slice electrophysiology,
perineuronal net imaging, in vivo chemogenetics, and compulsive alcohol drinking analyses. This multilevel,
orthogonal experimental approach positions this project to yield vertical advances toward novel therapeutics
targeting compulsive alcohol consumption and insight to myriad neuropsychiatric disorders involving dorsal
striatal dysfunction."
10773164,"Project Abstract
The paradigmatic approach to chemotherapy has been to identify and target driver mutations. However, after
initial response to therapy, many patients develop a recurrent drug-resistant disease leading to high mortality
rates. This resistance may be encoded, driven by somatic mutations, or adaptive, where changes in the
epigenetic programs result in phenotypic plasticity. Critically, the relative contribution of encoded versus
adaptive mechanisms of drug resistance and how these impact therapeutic response is poorly
understood. Advances in single cell multiomics have been crucial for the detection of rare genetic and epigenetic
events that may drive resistance and cannot be observed by bulk sequencing. However, progress has been
limited as most experiments only profile either the encoded (via genome sequencing) or adaptive (via
transcriptome or epigenome profiles) states. Only recently have new techniques made it possible to measure
these modalities from the same cell, or population of cells. This project proposes the development of a new class
of scalable statistical models that will help identify causal determinants of treatment failure in small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and metastasis in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and gastric adenocarcinoma
(GAC) — all diseases with significant morbidity and low cure rates. These cancers each exemplify components
of intratumoral heterogeneity and its interplay with the tumor microenvironment. Each translational study in this
project generates datasets comprising high-dimensional covariates that require scalable computational methods
to analyze. Machine learning methods are highly scalable but have difficulty with actionable interventional and
counterfactual queries, and do not account for confounding factors — covariates that affect both intervention and
its target. Causal models on the other hand, are designed to account for confounding factors, but do not scale
well. Here, we address these two needs by developing novel computational methods at the intersection of
multiview learning and causal inference. In the K99 phase, the focus will be on developing a causal inference
framework and software to identify the impact of cell intrinsic processes on patient response to therapy, inferred
from high dimensional multiomic single cell data. In the R00 phase, this framework will be extended to focus on
cell extrinsic processes, including profiling the tumor microenvironment and cell-cell interactions. The methods
developed here will be applicable to any type of cancer. Thus, we anticipate that this project will not only improve
our understanding of SCLC, GAC, and HGSOC progression, but have a broader impact on cancer research as
major consortia release similar data to the public. I have put together an interdisciplinary mentorship group with
expertise in genomics, phenotypic plasticity, and causal machine learning. This proposal also details a training
program that will help me successfully achieve the goals of this proposal and transition to a tenure track scientific
career in cancer research."
10755737,"The tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), is considered
a major contributor to the induction of lung cancer in smokers. The metabolism of NNK is complex with its
carcinogenic effects likely via the formation of its major pro-carcinogenic metabolite, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-
(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). Two enantiomers of NNAL are formed: (R)- and (S)-NNAL, both of which are
extensively detoxified by glucuronidation in humans. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate a strong and
statistically significant inverse association between the ratio of urinary (R)-NNAL-glucuronide (Gluc)/(S)-NNAL-
Gluc and lung cancer risk in two independent prospective cohort studies. Furthermore, smokers homozygous
for the deletion polymorphism of the major NNAL-glucuronidating enzyme, UGT2B17, had a significant 3-fold
higher risk for lung cancer than those with at least one functional UGT2B17 allele in both cohorts. These data
strongly support our hypothesis that (R)-NNAL plays a key role in tobacco-induced lung carcinogenesis and
suggests that we have identified novel important phenotypic and genetic markers of lung cancer risk. The goal
of this proposal is to evaluate the importance of NNAL enantiomers and glucuronides in lung cancer
carcinogenesis, and to elucidate novel phenotypic and genetic markers of NNAL formation and elimination
pathways and lung cancer risk in multiple populations. Our goals are to prospectively evaluate whether the
levels or ratios of specific urinary NNAL isomers or glucuronides are associated with lung cancer risk in: (1)
Chinese smokers from three cohort studies from Shanghai and Singapore, and (2) White and Black smokers
from the Southern Community Cohort Study, and to subsequently screen and validate genetic variants
associated with the variability in NNAL enantiomer and glucuronide formation. These studies should provide
crucial insight for understanding variability and establishing phenotypes and genotypes important in lung
cancer risk and will assist in identifying smokers at high risk for lung cancer for the development of
chemopreventive strategies targeting the NNK metabolism pathway."

Effective interventions with strong dissemination potential are critical for addressing the obesity epidemic.
Internet-delivered weight loss (IDWL) programs overcome many of the barriers common to face-to-face
interventions (e.g., geographical constraints, lack of childcare, high cost), but weight losses are approximately
half of that observed within in-person treatment. Novel approaches for improving long-term weight loss (WL)
within IDWL programs are needed. Yoga has been found to be an effective strategy for treating a variety of
health conditions (e.g., CVD risk factors, depression, pain syndromes), but has been largely overlooked within
the context of obesity management. Yoga has also been shown to strengthen self-regulatory skills (e.g.,
emotion regulation, cognitive regulation, and self-related processes) which are important for keeping WL off
long-term. Nonetheless, only two randomized trials to date have combined yoga and behavioral WL treatment.
While findings are initially promising, significant limitations include a lack of a control group and small sample
size in one study and a short follow-up (12 weeks) in the other. Also, mechanisms through which yoga impacts
WL within a weight management program have not been explored. In our pilot study, we found that providing
yoga following three months of behavioral WL treatment led to favorable effects on dietary lapses (i.e., discrete
episodes of dietary non-adherence which threaten WL), improved affect, and increased ability to resist dietary
temptations compared to a contact-matched control. Further, yoga had a significant effect on WL and
measures of self-regulation (distress tolerance, mindfulness, and self-compassion) among individuals who lost
more weight within the first three months of treatment. Adherence to the yoga intervention, retention, and
program satisfaction ratings were high. The proposed trial expands upon these promising preliminary findings
by increasing the length of yoga treatment (3 to 9 months), assessing participants over a longer, 18-month
period, broadening participant characteristics (including men and increasing racial/ethnic diversity), and
increasing the sample size, so that it is sufficiently powered to examine primary (WL) and secondary outcomes
(dietary lapses and other uncomfortable experiences which could trigger a dietary lapse) at 12 months.
Further, it seeks to fill an important gap in the literature by formally assessing the mechanisms through which
yoga impacts WL. All individuals will receive a 12-month Internet-delivered WL program and will be
randomized at the end of month 3 to a 9-month yoga program (delivered via videoconference) or 9-month
health and wellness program (contact-matched control). Participants will be followed for 6 months beyond the
end of treatment (final assessment at 18 months). This fully remote trial has great potential to impact both the
yoga and weight control fields and is particularly relevant given emerging research indicating that many
individuals now prefer online healthcare programs vs. in-person programs."
10808866,"Despite recent efforts to curb use, nicotine use is at an all time high, is responsible for millions of deaths each year
and remains one of the most difficult drugs to stop using. While there are many reports of opioid receptor, specifically
Kappa-opioid receptor dependent regulation of drug-seeking, there are are still few studies examining the circuit
mechanisms of stress-induced endogenous opioid peptide/receptor activity on natural reward and nicotine
reinstatement. In our first R01 cycle we determined that KORs within the basolateral amgydala, the CA1 of
hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens neurons are involved in nicotine place preference and reinstatement. In the
recent R37 cycle, we built substantially on our prior work, developing nicotine self-administration in mice so that we
can use several cutting-edge methods to assess circuit function. Here we proposed and determined that while our
lead candidate, BNST KORs were not required to reinstate nicotine seeking. We then in parallel turned to
methodically examining, other stress-sensitive, opioid peptide and receptor expressing regions including the dorsal
and ventral striatum, the BLA, the parabrachial nucleus, and the claustrum in order to determine where
dynorphin/KOR circuits are engaged to regulate, potentiate and reinstate reward seeking behaviors. Evidence from
our prior cycle, strongly suggests that amygdalar (BLA), dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens and claustrum are
among the likely critical loci mediating the effects of opioids, including KOR on stress induced reward seeking.
However, while we isolated these regions as important for a variety of stress and reward seeking behavioral
components, the specific cell types, circuit dynamics, plasticity, and the temporal role of these circuits in reward
regulation, and nicotine IVSA is still not known. In this cycle we propose to methodically dissect how activation of
KOR, either by stress-induced endogenous opioid release, optogenetic/chemogenetic modulation of opioid peptide
release, viral CRISPR, or systemic administration of a selective opioid receptor agonists, results in altered natural
reward seeking (action-outcome) models and in reinstatement of nicotine seeking in IVSA mouse models in an
excitatory BLA to BNST circuit. We propose the following Aims: 1) determine the role of dynorphin/KOR activity in
BLA-Striatal/Accumbens circuits as necessary - sufficient for regulating stress-induced reward seeking and
reinstatement of nicotine self-administration using retrograde viral rescue (“gain of function”), in vivo pharmacology,
and conditional mouse genetics; 2) Use optogenetics and in vivo 1p/2p calcium imaging, to determine the how
dynorphin and KOR in these circuits are activated by stress and regulate reward seeking behaviors 3) Using a mouse
model of nicotine self-administration (IVSA), determine if KOR/Dynorphin in the BLA-striatal circuits are required for
stress-induced reinstatement of nicotine IVSA. These studies test our central hypothesis that stress-induced
reinstatement of nicotine seeking is mediated via dynamic dynorphin-KOR activation within discrete cells, receptors,
and circuits.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Stress has protective and motivational components yet repeated uncontrollable stress exposure increases the risks
for mood disorders and drug abuse, including opioids and nicotine. Tobacco related deaths top 400,000 in US
annually and the biological mechanisms underlying these effects need to be explored in order to provide treatments
for nicotine addiction. Activation of the opioid systems in brain has been shown to encode the dysphoric and
anxiogenic effects of stress, regulates reward and causes relapse, so the outcomes of the proposed studies would
have direct impact on determining how stress modulates reward and offer novel therapeutic strategies for nicotine
addiction."

Pandemic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) secondary to infection with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) brought the public health importance of CAP into sharp focus.
Investigators in the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) systems biology center
developed a robust research infrastructure to prospectively collect 1,567 serial distal respiratory samples from
595 patients with severe CAP and hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) requiring mechanical ventilation and
analyze these clinical samples using state-of-the art multi-omics approaches. We leveraged these data to
generate a systems model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and applied it toward a successful clinical trial of
Auxora, a calcium release activated channel inhibitor, that resulted in a 53% reduction in 30-day mortality in a
phase II trial. In Super-SCRIPT (SCRIPT2), we propose to leverage and expand the longitudinal clinical and
molecular data in SCRIPT. By applying machine learning to clinical data, we observe that patients with severe
pneumonia undergo transitions between distinct, clinically recognizable states over the course of their
hospitalization that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. These transitions will serve as the
foundation for a model incorporating preliminary data generated from BAL and serum analysis that includes
single-cell RNA-sequencing of more than 500,000 bronchoalveolar lavage cells, cytokine levels, proteomic, T
cell epigenomic, and microbiome analyses. We will use these clinical and molecular data to test the hypothesis
that machine learning approaches applied to a latent space model of disease pathogenesis can identify
molecular predictors of favorable and unfavorable clinical transitions/outcomes during the clinical
course of CAP. A corollary hypothesis is that perturbations of these determinants during controlled clinical trials
of pharmacologic interventions will allow iteration of the models’ predictive capabilities. We will address these
hypotheses in three Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. To identify clinical predictors of favorable and unfavorable clinical transitions/outcomes over
 the course of CAP in patients requiring hospitalization.
 Aim 2. To determine distinct host or pathogen genomic features that predict favorable or unfavorable
 clinical transitions/outcomes in patients with severe CAP.
 Aim 3. To identify pathways that can be targeted for therapy with existing or newly developed
therapeutics.
SCRIPT2 draws on successful collaborations between clinicians, biologists and data scientists to organize clinical
data, process distal lung samples and integrate disparate datasets into latent space models to develop large
scale models of pneumonia that can be rapidly translated into care pathways and novel therapies."

Mechanical ventilation has saved the lives of countless patients with respiratory failure but may lead to the
dreaded complication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a form of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
HAP/VAP are associated with particularly high mortality rates despite the administration of appropriate and highly
potent antibiotics. Recent work suggests that the host inflammatory response, the specific pathogenic strain
causing the infection, and the pulmonary microbiome all contribute to the pathogenesis of HAP/VAP. However,
to our knowledge these three contributing factors have not been comprehensively examined together. To better
understand HAP/VAP, we established the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT)
Systems Biology Center to enroll pneumonia patients, collect bronchoalveolar lavage samples from them, and
apply multi-omic approaches to these samples. We hypothesize that these approaches will identify specific host
response patterns, pathogen genetic biosignatures, and pulmonary microbiome consortia that define and predict
the clinical trajectory of patients with HAP/VAP and define the pathogenesis of these infections. To test this
hypothesis, we will perform the following aims: (1) Identify host response biosignatures, (2) features of bacterial
pathogens, and (3) patterns of pulmonary microbiome consortia that inform pathogenesis and are associated
with clinical improvement or deterioration in HAP/VAP. (4) Integrate host response, pathogen, and microbiome
features with clinical metadata to generate a comprehensive computational model that predicts clinical outcomes
and favorable/unfavorable transitions in HAP/VAP. The data we generate will be useful clinically in identifying
those patients who require aggressive management and scientifically in providing a deeper understanding of the
pathogenesis of HAP/VAP."
10765738,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neonates have dampened expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and difficulty clearing pathogens, making
them uniquely susceptible to infections. This is a worldwide health problem, with neonatal infections
contributing to nearly one million deaths each year. The factors controlling neonatal specific immune
responses and how and when they transition to more mature responses are poorly understood. Neonates rely
heavily on innate immune responses to fight infections due to major defects in their adaptive immune system.
Monocytes and macrophages are central to innate immune responses by sensing pathogens and initiating an
inflammatory cascade that directs their clearance. Although both neonatal and adult monocytes/macrophages
contain the same genetic code, they exhibit dramatic differences in pathogen-induced gene expression. Post-
translational histone modifications can regulate gene transcription by influencing chromatin structure and
accessibility, and likely play a role in this. Monocytes/macrophages demonstrate a developmental stage-
specific increase in the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 with an associated gain in the activating histone
modification histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at promoter sites of immunologically important genes
as development progresses from extremely preterm neonate to adult. This gain allows for increasingly robust
inflammatory responses as development advances. Microbial colonization of the skin and gastrointestinal tract
occurs after birth and is associated with type 1 interferon expression, which is believed to guide immune
system maturation and prevent detrimental pathogen responses. Chorioamnionitis is an inflammatory process
affecting neonates around the time of birth, which negatively impacts immune system development and
predisposes exposed neonates to long-term immune-related complications. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that neonatal monocytes/macrophages are largely un-patterned with H3K4me3 due to lack
of in utero microbial exposure, and that postnatal microbial exposure stimulates low grade type 1 IFN
expression which drives MLL1 expression and directs macrophage H3K4me3 deposition in a
developmental stage-specific manner. Chorioamnionitis exposure stimulates a developmentally
inappropriate level of type 1 interferon expression, which results in dysregulated MLL1 expression and
global remodeling of the neonatal monocyte/macrophage landscape with subsequent dysfunctional
monocyte/macrophage responses. This hypothesis will be investigated via the following specific aims: 1)
Characterize normal human monocyte H3K4me3 patterning during infancy and early childhood and determine
how developmental stage-specific H3K4me3 monocyte patterning impacts chromatin accessibility and gene
expression, 2) Determine the requirement and sufficiency of type 1 interferons in MLL1-driven H3K4me3
placement in murine macrophage development and function, and 3) Determine the roles of type 1 interferons
and MLL1 in chorioamnionitis-induced murine macrophage H3K4me3 remodeling and subsequent function."

forces encoding a MP embedded in a lipid bilayer must be distinct from that of soluble
proteins in water.
 Our research efforts contribute to filling this key gap in the understanding the physical
chemistry of membrane proteins. We will experimentally determine of energetic forces
stabilizing membrane proteins along the steeply changing polarity gradient of the
phospholipid bilayer interface, quantify backbone hydrogen bond strengths, and expand
our repertoire of membrane protein folding models to include those with an a-helical
secondary structure. These efforts will be complemented by molecular simulations and
other solution biophysics interrogations as needed.
 Our results have broad ranging impact in the field at large through contributions to
information databases used in training computational algorithms and by their
incorporation in physically realistic mechanisms for protein folding catalysis by cellular
machines."

The public health impact of TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa) proteinopathy is estimated to be on
the same order of magnitude as that of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TDP-43 was first associated with
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the second most common cause of dementia in patients under 65.
TDP-43 was later shown to be present in up to 60% of brains with AD, the most common cause of dementia.
TDP-43 pathology is heterogeneous in FTLD-TDP and is associated with multiple dementia syndromes, which
complicates FTLD-TDP diagnosis in living patients. These patients, who present with a wide range of associated
clinical symptoms, are underserved, as their complex clinicopathologic heterogeneity leads to uncertainty
surrounding their diagnosis. A major hurdle in elucidating the clinicopathologic relationships between dementia
syndromes and specific markers of FTLD-TDP is the heterogeneous molecular species of the TDP-43 inclusions.
More specifically, some TDP-43 species are pathologic, while some are not. Similarly, TDP-43 pathology in AD
is heterogeneous, and the AD TDP types’ associations with the different molecular species of TDP-43 and
neurodegeneration are unknown. Thus, producing an antibody that is specific for the pathologic TDP-43 species
will be crucial for elucidating the clinicopathologic relationship in FTLD-TDP and AD. After screening over 5,000
monoclonal antibody (MAb) clones in our lab, we have successfully produced the novel, home-made MAb #9,
which is specific for the pathologic TDP-43 species. This antibody can strongly recognize a 35 kDa TDP-43
species rarely reported in humans and can reveal additional dense TDP-43 inclusions in brain areas showing
neurodegeneration. The goals of this study are to elucidate this novel, MAb #9-recognized pathologic TDP-43
species and its association with TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration in FTLD-TDP and AD. We
hypothesize that MAb #9 binds the previously undescribed TDP-43 species present in unique inclusions that
localize to brain regions with local neurodegeneration. We will test this hypothesis via three aims. In Aim 1, we
will elucidate the amino acid sequence of this novel MAb#9-detected TDP-43 species using tandem mass
spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine the relationships between MAb #9-
positive inclusions, pathology types, and local neurodegeneration in FTLD-TDP and AD using
immunohistochemical and neuropathological approaches. Findings from this study will significantly improve our
understanding of a novel toxic TDP-43 species and its association with pathology and neurodegeneration. The
findings will be a key step toward developing a biomarker that can predict the presence of TDP-43 in living FTLD
and AD patients. Given that TDP-43 is a potential therapeutic target in treating FTLD and now AD, the knowledge
will likely also have a significant impact on future therapies for both diseases."

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and a chronic mental illness. There are currently only two FDA-approved medications for the treatment of PTSD, both of which may take weeks to months to reach full clinical effects. The rates of nonresponse to these selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are high. Therefore, there is a tremendous need to test novel pharmacological approaches to PTSD. Trauma focus psychotherapies on the other hand require a high level of commitment by attending weekly visits for a substantial amount to time. An average course of Prolonged Exposures therapy (PE) or Trauma focus CBT usually lasts about 3 months until completion with high dropout rate and about 50% of completers being classified as non-responders. Recent studies demonstrated the effectiveness of intensive exposure therapy for PTSD which is being delivered within 1-2 weeks period that are as affective as a 3-month full course treatment but have a lower dropout rate.

There are evidences to suggest that fear extinction may be further enhanced with the use of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist mostly used as anesthetic. Interest in ketamine as a possible treatment for PTSD began when it was found to alleviate depressive symptoms. Two recent studies have reported that ketamine reduces PTSD symptoms during the course of drug administration period and up to 7-day post treatment, but all participants convert to PTSD soon after drug discontinuation.

Using a biomarker-informed, double blind placebo-controlled design, the present proposal aims to examine the efficacy of ketamine infusion (0.5mg/kg vs 0.2mg/kg in the R61 phase to established dose; selected superior dose will advance to the R33), as compared to an active placebo (midazolam 0.045mg/kg) in enhancing postretrieval extinction of Criterion A original trauma memory. Pharmacological intervention will be combined with an intensive 4-day exposure therapy, utilizing elevated BDNF levels and increased neuroplasticity, to potentially produce a rapid and sustained reduction in PTSD symptomatology. In addition, we propose use of state-of-the-art neuroimaging assessments at baseline and at the end of treatment trial to gain insight into the neurobiology of PTSD and the neural mechanisms dictating treatment response or resistance."
10898550,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of retroviruses occupying 8% of human genome.
Transcription of HERVs is generally suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms; but recent studies, including ours,
have provided evidence that LTR5_Hs, the human-specific HERV species, is specifically reactivated in human
Primordial Germ Cells as well as its human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cell culture model hPGCLCs
(human Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells). Currently available evidence obtained from our preliminary studies
as well as presented in very recent literature supports that LTR5_Hs is required for conversion of hPSCs to
hPGCLCs and that hPGCLCs (but not hPSCs) release Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) from plasma membrane.
Taking advantage of our recent success in Long-Term Culture hPGCLCs (LTC-hPGCLCs), this project will
examine (1) whether the reactivation of LTR5_Hs creates new, hPGCLC-specific boundaries of the
topologically associated domains (TADs), which may support germline differentiation of hPSCs; and (2)
whether VLPs released from hPGCLCs can convey viral and/or non-viral molecules, including the retroviral
reverse transcriptase, from LTC-hPGCLCs to other human cells. Our Specific Aim 1 will use the CARGO
(chimeric array of gRNA oligos)-CRISPRi and the piggyBac vector for comprehensive suppression of the 697
known copies of LTR5_Hs and random insertion of exogenous copies of LTR5_Hs from/to the genome of
hPSCs and LTC-hPGCLCs. The engineered cells will be subjected to deep sequencing analyses of TADs (Hi-
C seq), transcriptomes (RNA-seq), and epigenomes (ChIP-seq). Efficiencies of (A) in vitro conversion of
hPSCs to hPGCLCs or cells representing the three germ layers, and (B) male LTC-hPGCLC differentiation to
gonocytes in the xrTestis xenogeneic reconstituted testis organoid culture system, will be evaluated by single
cell RNA-seq as well as immunofluorescence staining. Specific Aim 2 will attempt to establish the LTR5_Hs
origin of VLPs released from LTC-hPGCLCs by immunogold staining and enrich the VLPs for further analyses
of their components such as RNA species, proteins, and enzymatic activities derived from viral or host cells.
Attempts will be further made to label the VLPs with peptide antigen tags and/or fluorescence proteins to
determine whether the VLPs can fuse into, and possibly internalized in, other human cells surrounding
hPGCLCs in human embryoids generated in a microfluidics system as well as other types of hiPSC-derived
embryonic cells. If the proposed experiments are successfully completed, we expect to obtain important
mechanistic insights into how retrovirus-derived, human-specific genomic elements contribute to development
of germline cells, potentially creating a novel paradigm that highlights the physiological importance of exapted
HERVs in human reproduction. Our experiments may also support the novel concept that VLPs function as an
intercellular conveyer of viral and/or host cell molecules, potentially revolutionize our knowledge about
physiological roles of HERVs in human development and health."

Kidney transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage renal disease. Tacrolimus is utilized
to prevent rejection of the kidney transplant but has a narrow therapeutic window with subtherapeutic tacrolimus
levels associated with acute rejection and supratherapeutic levels associated with nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity. Importantly, kidney transplant recipients with tacrolimus trough variability, i.e. marked intra-patient
variation in tacrolimus trough levels, are at increased risk for acute rejection and kidney transplant loss. The
factors predicting intra-patient tacrolimus trough variability, however, are not well understood. Our preliminary
studies support a relationship between gut bacterial metabolism of tacrolimus and tacrolimus trough variability.
The overall objective of this study is to define the relationship between the gut microbiota and tacrolimus
trough variability in kidney transplant recipients. Our central hypothesis is that specific gut microbial species
are associated with metabolism of tacrolimus and intra-patient tacrolimus trough variability. The hypothesis is
based upon and inspired by our pilot studies: (1) Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and other commensal organisms
directly metabolize tacrolimus into M1, a lesser active tacrolimus metabolite (2) M1 production is present in the
fecal specimens of kidney transplant recipients (3) blood M1 is detected in kidney transplant recipients after oral
administration of tacrolimus (Guo et al., Drug Metabo Dispos 47(3):194-202, 2019; Guo et al., Transplant Direct
6(10):e601, 2020).
In this study, we will recruit 80 kidney transplant recipients for serial collection of fecal specimens during the first
3 months following transplantation and will profile the gut microbiome using metagenomic sequencing. As in vivo
biomarkers of bacterial tacrolimus metabolism, we will profile blood M1 (the bacterial tacrolimus metabolite)
levels and quantitative fecal M1 production to assess their relationships with intra-patient tacrolimus trough
variability as well as acute rejection and de novo donor specific antibody development against the kidney
transplant. In Aim 1, we will identify the gut bacterial species associated with tacrolimus metabolism. In Aim 2,
we will determine the gut bacterial and blood profiles associated with intra-patient tacrolimus trough variability.
Significance. Our study will enable development of gut-based and blood-based biomarkers to identify kidney
transplant recipients at high risk for tacrolimus trough variability. Our study will provide the framework for
providing improved precision delivery of immunosuppressive therapies in kidney transplant recipients."
10904668,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen. C. trachomatis infections
can ascend to the female upper genital tract (UGT) leading to acute and chronic infections than cause pelvic
inflammatory disease and fallopian tube scarring. These inflammatory pathologies have a large negative
impact on women’s reproductive health. We know remarkably little as to the cellular and molecular processes
underlying acute and chronic infections of the UGT, and how they promote permanent tissue damage even
long after the pathogen has been cleared. Similarly, what role Chlamydia virulence factors play in this process
is largely unknown. In this application we propose to apply emerging transcriptional profiling technologies to
catalogue the cellular and gene expression events from initial infection, to resolution, to fibrotic damage post
bacterial clearance at single cell resolution in the female UGT following a challenge with Chlamydia
muridarum, a mouse adapted Chlamydia sp. In addition, to understand the mechanisms underlying the
emergence of fibrosis and how long-lasting tissue damage that can lead to infertility, we will compare cellular
responses in the UGT and their corresponding single-cell gene expression profiles upon challenges with
Chlamydia mutants that cause altered pathologies. These longitudinal studies will define the types of cells that
drive Chlamydia-dependent inflammatory damage and provide new insight as to how the spatial distribution of
these cells correlate with pathogen clearance and pathology. Furthermore, the proposed studies will provide a
unique resource for the characterization of inflammatory processes and fibrotic damage in an organ of
significant importance for reproductive health."
10876238,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The SaeR/S two component system is a central regulator of virulence in Staphylococcus aureus. It is
composed of an intramembrane sensor kinase SaeS and a response regulator DNA binding protein
SaeR. During a screen for factors that modulate SaeR/S activity, we discovered insertions in two
genes that encode putative oligoendopeptidase F (PepF) enzymes (hereafter referred to as PepF1
and PepF2 due to homology with Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis PepFs). PepFs are
members of the M3 family of zinc metallopeptidases. Unlike eukaryotic M3 peptidases, prokaryotic
M3 peptidases are understudied and have been enigmatic since their discovery. B. subtilis PepF is
the only functionally characterized M3 peptidase to date, and when overproduced cleaves a short
peptide, inhibiting a key sporulation signaling cascade in that organism. S. aureus pepF1 and pepF2
mutants reduced SaeR/S activity individually and additively. While S. aureus pepF null mutants are
unaffected for growth in laboratory media, including one rich in peptides, pepF mutants show defects
in expression of Sae-dependent genes, and survival in whole human blood. Notably, a pepF1 pepF2
double mutant is attenuated for virulence in a systemic infection model. Altogether, our preliminary
data suggest a role in regulation and not nutrition or general protein turnover. Despite the
characterization of eukaryotic M3 peptidases to date and only a small number of studies with
prokaryotic M3 peptidases – all with test substrates – there is a major knowledge gap for these
important peptidases. In this proposal, we will unravel the role of PepFs in promoting pathogenesis in
this important human pathogen and, more broadly, explore PepF biology and M3 peptidase activity.
We will do this using two specific aims. First, we will use an unbiased and cutting-edge mass
spectrometry-based peptidomics approach to identify substrates of PepF1 and PepF2 and perform
functional studies on confirmed substrates. Second, we will reveal the regulatory cascade leading to
gene regulation by PepFs. To do so, we will use RNA-Sequencing to delineate the set of S. aureus
genes affected by S. aureus PepFs, and then use mutagenesis to identify factors that control pepF
gene expression. In the end, by collaborating with an expert in the field of mass spectrometry-based
proteomics, we will generate data that, for the first time, will identify cleavage preference and
substrate specificity determinants for the M3 family. At the same time, we will gain a deeper
understanding how one of the most important virulence regulators in S. aureus is controlled and
reveal how environmental and physiological signals are integrated into the virulence regulatory
network to precisely upregulate pathogenic potential of this human pathogen."
10821329,"JASPR (SIGNATURE PROJECT): ABSTRACT
 Significance: The significance of this Signature Project is derived from its powerful combination of (1)
targeting a high-risk population -- adult patients at risk for suicide presenting to emergency departments (EDs);
(2) addressing trenchant barriers that have prevented delivery of suicide-related evidence-based practices
(EBPs) in the ED through an innovative, multi-component, NIMH-funded technology called Jaspr; and (3)
evaluating Jaspr’s efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation, all in the same highly efficient study.
 Investigators: Jaspr’s project team has pioneered ED systems-based suicide prevention using continuous
quality improvement implementation strategies (Boudreaux, Kiefe, Larkin, Johnson, Volturo); digital behavioral
health technology development and deployment (Boudreaux, Dimeff, Gerber); using multi-method approaches,
including patient-reported measures, electronic health record (EHR) data, and death registries, for outcome and
intervention target ascertainment (Boudreaux, Kiefe, Gerber); implementation science research design and
analytic methodologies (Kiefe, Yang, Larkin); and healthcare economics (Singh, Clements).
 Innovation: This will be the first study to comprehensively evaluate a multi-component suicide prevention
technology that facilitates delivery of suicided-related EBPs while replacing wasted waiting time with productive
time. Its multi-component nature satisfies several key performance elements for systems adopting Zero Suicide.
A novel, award-winning hybrid study design called Complementary Randomized Controlled Trial and Real-World
Study for Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Implementation Design (CREID) will be used.
 Approach: CREID comprises two separate but related components or parts. Part A, Randomized Controlled
Trial (RCT), will be a patient-level, randomized, parallel-arm, single-blind trial (n=670) comparing Jaspr
(Intervention) to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU; Active Comparator Control). Consistent with NIMH’s
experimental therapeutics paradigm, Part A’s primary aim is to determine Jaspr’s efficacy in improving suicide-
related outcomes in the 12 months after the index ED visit and to explore its potential mechanisms of action
through engaging patient intervention targets and EBP delivery. In Part B, Real-World Study, four diverse EDs
will implement Jaspr as part of routine care. Part B’s primary aim will be to evaluate Jaspr’s effectiveness when
used in a real-world setting. Finally, both Parts will be used to explore Jaspr’s implementation, including
establishing system, clinician, and patient factors anticipated to affect Jaspr adoption and implementation.
 Environment: The UMass Chan Medical School (UMass), Jaspr Health, and partnering organizations have
proven their ability to support this ambitious study by their success with numerous NIMH-funded, systems-based
suicide prevention studies and SBIR/STTRs technology grants, including the SBIR that created Jaspr.
 Impact: Accelerated translation of Jaspr and advancing knowledge pertaining to the implementation of
suicide care technologies in the ED setting has the potential to help thousands of suicidal individuals annually."
10821338,"CATS (EXPLORATORY PROJECT): ABSTRACT
 Significance: Approximately 45% of individuals who die by suicide had a visit with their primary care provider
(PCP) in the month prior to their death and 77% in the year prior, making primary care clinics a crucial
environment for identifying suicide risk. However, consistency and quality of screening for suicide risk in this
setting vary widely by provider and clinic because of differences in providers’ comfort with assessing, discussing,
and managing suicide, the need to consider broader symptoms and risks factors in addition to suicidal ideation,
and the burden of competing medical demands and myriad mandated screenings. Computerized adaptive tests
(CATs) have transformative potential for addressing these barriers and identifying and tracking mental health
conditions, including suicide risk in primary care.
 Investigators: Our multi-disciplinary team comprised of specialists in suicide prevention and primary care
(Davis-Martin, Mullin); EHR integration, health informatics and user-centered design (Tulu); user experience
(Djamasbi); healthcare workflow redesign (Johnson); implementation science (Davis-Martin, Johnson);
economics (Singh); privacy/ethics (Nebeker); and CATs (Gibbons) will work together to accomplish the Aims.
 Innovation: Using CATs to address initial detection, quantification, and longitudinal monitoring of suicide
risk embedded in a range of mental health indicators in primary care is novel. We will create a package for
downstream system-wide deployment for primary care clinics that enables easy patient access to complete CATs
through multiple modalities and optimizes CATs results presentation for maximum clinical utility.
 Approach: We will study existing implementations of CAT-MHTM in three care settings, using key informant
interviews with clinical administrators and providers, to identify variations in clinical workflows, barriers to
deployment, and strategies for achieving effective EHR integration, HIPAA compliance, user acceptance, and
clinical utility. We will integrate CAT-MHTM into the UMass EHR test environment, reflecting various workflows
and result displays identified. A sample of primary care medical and behavioral health clinicians (n~10) will test
alternatives, in the UMass iCELS, with standardized patients. We will capture CAT-MHTM result display utilization
with eye tracking technology and identify strengths/weaknesses of designs using talk-through techniques. We
will test the feasibility of deploying CAT-MHTM with clinicians and actual patients in one primary care clinic using
the EPIS framework to guide implementation and a CQI approach to determine the best fitting clinical workflow.
Implementation measures will include acceptability, usability, feasibility, reach, fidelity and simple costing.
 Environment: UMass, WPI, and ATT have successfully collaborated on numerous federally funded projects
(R44MH118780, R44DA049448, NSF-IIS-1065298).
 Impact: This study will be used as pilot data for the subsequent implementation trial R01 that will study the
implementation of the updated CAT-MHTM and workflows into the remaining primary care practices at UMass."
10821343,"ADAPT (EXPLORATORY PROJECT): SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Significance: Machine learning-based risk algorithms have transformational potential to improve suicide risk
identification. However, the lack of large-scale validations, transfer guidance, and automated learning-based
adaptation impedes adoption in clinical practice. This project aims to address this translation gap by
systematically assessing and improving a suicide risk algorithm’s generalizability and adaptability from an
original development setting to a new healthcare system.
 Investigators: The transdisciplinary team has comprehensive expertise in applying advanced machine
learning techniques on electronic health record (EHR) data for predictive modeling and prevention analytics (Liu,
Aseltine, Simon), studying clinical diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of serious mood disorders and suicide
(Rothschild), identifying and assessing suicide risk (Simon), and promoting health services delivery redesign
through technology and implementing informatics tools in clinical settings (Gerber).
 Innovation: This pioneering study will comprehensively evaluate and improve the generalizability and
adaptability of an evidence-based suicide risk algorithm in different contexts. The team will build a unified pipeline
of Automated, Data-driven, AdaPtable, and Transferable learning for suicide risk prediction (ADAPT). The
versatile ADAPT tool will be accessible to non-expert users and compatible with EHR common data model
standards, providing a scalable, interpretable and sustainable solution to risk algorithm translation across
different clinical contexts. Moreover, we will design an advanced deep learning approach for suicide risk
prediction and evaluate its effectiveness on generalizability and adaptability.
 Approach: The proposed study aims to assess the generalizability of the Mental Health Research Network
(MHRN) risk algorithm and explore transfer and ensemble learning to adapt a previously learned model from
original data sources into a tailored one optimized for a new health system (Aim 1); develop a unified pipeline,
ADAPT, to integrate data preprocessing, model assessment and adaptation, model interpretation, and
automated learning; explore how ADAPT’s results can be used to help match individuals to a range of
intervention approaches where specialized or intensive treatment is reserved for those with the highest risk
(Aim 2); design an innovative deep learning approach and test its effectiveness using ADAPT (Aim 3a); engage
stakeholders to better understand potential barriers and facilitators to implementation, iteratively improve
ADAPT’s usability, acceptability, and feasibility through their feedback using validated scales (Aim 3b).
 Environment: The UMass Chan Medical School (UMass) has proven its ability to support this ambitious
study by its success with numerous NIMH-funded systems-based suicide prevention studies.
 Impact: The study holds great potential for promoting the implementation of an evidence-based EHR suicide
risk algorithm in clinical practice. Paired with effective interventions, it will enable improved suicide prevention."

barriers to traditional suicide risk screenings: (1) high student health center burden,9 (2) provider discomfort,10,11
(3) infrequent visits, and (4) poor patient recall.9 This project aims to establish the needs, acceptability, usability,

computational modeling (Project Co-Lead: Rundensteiner); implementation science (Lemon); data analysis
(Yang); machine learning (Agu); business development (Dunlap); economics (Singh); and ethics (Nebeker).
 Innovation: This study extends our team’s pioneering mobile health app Early Mental Health Uncovering
(EMU12–16), which uses passively-obtained data streams from students’ smartphones (e.g., GPS, number/type
of contacts, etc.) to screen for depression and suicidal ideation.13,14 Leveraging CAPES resources, we will assess
an automated smartphone-powered strategy to increase the adoption and effectiveness of suicide risk screening,
with resource needs assessment and stakeholder co-development for translation into practice.
 Approach: This project, Leveraging Early Mental Health Uncovering Risk for Suicide (LEMURS), extends
our work on EMU, which uses passively-obtained data from participants’ smartphones to screen for distress and
suicide ideation13,14 and extends this to LEMURS which will activate risk alerts in health provider-facing
dashboards, and applies implementation science principles for integration and uptake in college health centers.
The project has several aims to: (1) understand stakeholder needs and concerns for this technology via
interviews with students, clinicians, and staff; (2) co-develop a provider-facing dashboard responsive to student
preferences and clinician workflow needs via iterative interviews and prototype evaluations; (3) explore how
LEMURS can integrate with suicide risk interventions; and (4) evaluate feasibility/barriers by deploying LEMURS
in a college healthcare setting in 40 students (n=20 with high suicide risk) alongside daily surveys evaluating
self-reported suicide risk. This project will explore system, clinician, and patient influences on implementation.
 Environment: UMass Amherst and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), along with CAPES collaborators,
have proven their ability to support this bold study in their success with developing health-enabling technologies

the potential to ease the burden on health systems and reach thousands of at-risk students annually."
10773174,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The intersection of tuberculosis (TB) with non-communicable diseases, including diabetes mellitus, has emerged
as a critical clinical and public health obstacle. Rapidly expanding diabetes epidemics threaten TB control in low-
and middle-income countries, including the country of Georgia, where preventing and treating TB disease remains
a great burden. However, to date, the notion that TB disease may increase the risk of metabolic diseases like
diabetes has not been well explored. This study will determine the extent to which TB-induced stress hyperglycemia
impacts the risk of poor TB treatment outcomes. We will also assess whether stress hyperglycemia or adipose
tissue inflammation during TB increase the risk of diabetes post-TB. This research will advance understanding of
dual burdens of TB-diabetes and inform treatment guidelines for management of stress hyperglycemia during TB.
The long-term objective of this research is to develop an evidence base to help identify which patients with TB
are likely to benefit most from adjunctive anti-inflammatory glucose-lowering agents. The specific aims of this
proposal are to: (1) determine the relationship between stress hyperglycemia and TB outcomes, including TB cure
rate and time to sputum culture conversion; (2) determine the extent that stress hyperglycemia during TB increases
the risk of diabetes 1-year after TB treatment; and (3) explore the relationship between plasma and subcutaneous
tissue biomarkers of adipose tissue inflammation with stress hyperglycemia and diabetes risk. The aims of this
project will be achieved by enrolling a cohort of patients at the time of TB diagnosis and following them prospectively
during treatment and for 1-year post-TB treatment. At multiple time points during this study we will measure
glucose, insulin resistance, lipids, adipokines, and anthropometry among participants with diabetes, stress
hyperglycemia, and euglycemia. In a subset of the cohort we will perform adipose tissue biopsies and measure
adipose tissue inflammation. The analyses will include multiple modeling strategies to assess the relationship
between patient and host factors and the risk of post-TB metabolic disease.
This proposal will directly address clinical uncertainties related to the growing global concern of intersecting TB
and diabetes epidemics. The study will help to characterize the extent to which TB contributes to diabetes
incidence and will identify which patients with hyperglycemia are at greatest risk of poor TB outcomes. In addition,
this R01 will explore novel biomarkers of adipose tissue inflammation to determine whether TB alters immune
activity or metabolic function within human adipose tissue. A long-term goal of the proposed work is to prepare for
prospective interventional studies that will evaluate glucose-lowering agents during active TB as adjunctive therapy
to improve TB outcomes and reduce risk of diabetes after TB."
10791923,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Patients diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15-39y have not seen the same improvement in survival
when compared with patients diagnosed as children (<15y). These patients have received special designation
by the NCI as adolescents and young adults (AYA), accompanied by a mandate to address these outcome
disparities. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) epitomizes this phenomenon, where survival rates in AYA
continue to lag behind children (5y overall survival: 1-14y: 86%; 15-21: 56%; 22-29: 42%; 30-39: 35%). Across
pediatric-inspired and adult-style therapy regimens, ALL therapy includes a prolonged (~2y) maintenance phase
of chemotherapy requiring daily oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP). A large investigation recently confirmed that
inadequate systemic exposure to 6MP is associated with an increased risk of relapse; to measure systemic 6MP
exposure, this comprehensive approach assessed the levels of a 6MP metabolite (thioguanine nucleotide [TG])
incorporated into DNA (DNA-TG). Several AYA-specific factors likely contribute to systemic 6MP exposure and
have not been examined systematically. These factors are likely related to both the AYA patient (6MP adherence)
and healthcare (disease management, reflected by the provider-prescribed 6MP dose intensity [DI]), as well as
the barriers and facilitators within these domains. We hypothesize that systemic exposure to 6MP will correlate
with both 6MP adherence (in the patient domain) and disease management, as represented by provider-
prescribed 6MP DI (in the healthcare domain). We will examine these associations between DNA-TG levels and
both 6MP adherence and 6MP DI, adjusting for pharmacogenetics. We will then identify barriers/ facilitators to
both 6MP adherence and disease management, using a mixed methods convergent parallel study design, both
quantitatively determining the predictors of adherence and 6MP DI, and qualitatively describing the perspectives
of both the patients and healthcare providers. We will conduct this study using a prospective cohort of AYA
patients in ALL maintenance therapy across a national 14-site consortium of multiple types of facilities and
oncology practices. For 6 months per patient, 6MP adherence will be monitored electronically and monthly DNA-
TG levels will be followed (peripheral blood). Patient questionnaires will capture self-reported barriers and
facilitators of adherence as well as sociodemographics; institution-level questionnaires will capture healthcare
factors. Findings from this study have the potential to identify both patient-related and healthcare-related targets
amenable to interventions with the potential to mitigate AYA outcome disparities in AYA patients with ALL.
Furthermore, this study establishes the infrastructure to continue to follow this cohort for relapse, and conduct
intervention(s) informed by this proposed trial within a novel AYA-focused consortium."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the immune destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. The
disease cannot be prevented, and the only treatment available is a life-long use of insulin injected multiple
times a day. Insulin-producing beta cells can now be generated from pluripotent stem cells in the laboratory.
This recent achievement has raised the prospect of restoring insulin production in patients by beta cell
transplantation. However, the autoimmunity underlying T1D is long-lasting and will destroy new beta cells if
they are transplanted without immunosuppression. A new therapy that protects beta cells is urgently needed
not only enable curative beta cell replacement in patients but also to prevent diabetes in individuals at risk of
developing the disease. To discover genetic targets for such a therapy, we performed a genome-wide search
using CRIPSR-Cas9 genome editing in a mouse model for T1D. This broad unbiased search identified the
gene Renalase (RNLS). Significantly, RNLS had previously been associated with the overall risk and the age-
of-onset of T1D by human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting a role for RNLS in diabetes
pathogenesis. We went on to confirm that deleting RNLS protected mouse beta cells against cellular stress
and autoimmunity. We corroborated the protective effect of RNLS deletion in human stem cell-derived beta
cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that a small molecule inhibitor of RNLS would also protect.
Using structure-based molecular modeling, we identified the FDA-approved drug pargyline as a potential RNLS
inhibitor. We showed that pargyline treatment replicated the protective effects of RNLS deletion, making this
drug a potential candidate for a preventive treatment for T1D. Now, we aim to better understand how RNLS
deficiency protects beta cells against cellular stress and autoimmunity. Further, we aim to more extensively
test the therapeutic potential of pargyline. To these ends, we will pursue three Specific Aims. First, we will
evaluate metabolic plasticity as a possible mechanistic basis for the protection of RNLS deficient cells. Second,
we will quantify and delineate the immunogenicity of Rnls deficient beta cells in vitro and in mouse models for
T1D. Third, we will evaluate the therapeutic utility of pargyline as a mimic of Rnls deletion, both at the cellular
level and in the context of autoimmune diabetes in mice. Completing the first two Aims will help explain the
mechanism by which RNLS modifies beta cell vulnerability and the risk of type 1 diabetes. The third Aim will
support the translation of our discoveries into a clinical application by testing the therapeutic value of drug we
identified as a RNLS inhibitor. Our research team is composed of experts in immunology, beta cell biology and
stem cell differentiation. We are ideally positioned to explore the role of RNLS in T1D from perspectives that
range from cellular biology to systemic autoimmunity, with the prospect of improving our understanding of
disease pathology and developing a preventive drug. Our research will utilize both a well characterized mouse
model for T1D and human beta cells to ascertain the relevance of our findings for human disease."

Latino caregivers of individuals with dementia (IWDs) experience disproportionate levels of stress, depression,
and poor access to caregiver community resources. Caregiver support interventions can reduce caregiver
stress by providing knowledge and skills regarding dementia, caregiving, available community resources, and
coping with stress. Unfortunately, most primary care clinics offer little in terms of caregiver support for their
patients with dementia. Community health workers (CHWs) are being used in many primary care clinics to
provide culturally tailored health education and connections with community resources, but to our knowledge
have not been specifically engaged in providing support for caregivers of IWDs. There is a unique opportunity
to engage CHWs in efforts to implement caregiver support interventions among Latinos in primary care. The
overall objective of this project is to inform the development of an implementation strategy in which CHWs
deliver ¡Unidos Podemos! among Latinos in primary care. ¡Unidos Podemos! is a culturally tailored evidence-
based caregiver support intervention for Latinos. We propose an implementation strategy that leverages CHWs
already working in primary care and provides them with the training, resources and ongoing support needed to
implement ¡Unidos Podemos!. On Aim 1 we will identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of
¡Unidos Podemos! by CHWs among Latinos in primary care. On Aim 2 we will test the feasibility of a CHW-
support strategy for implementing ¡Unidos Podemos! among Latino caregivers in two primary care clinics."
10841477,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE 
 Research in CNS metabolism has garnered interest from many fields, including Alzheimer’s Disease, brain 
injury (including traumatic injury, stroke, etc), epilepsy, and Parkinson’s Disease, and likely involves all areas of 
CNS-related research. The University of Kentucky College of Medicine has made significant investments over 
the last few years in both metabolomics instrumentation and investigators with metabolomics expertise that 
enhanced existing UK strengths in neuroscience, cancer, cardiovascular, and diabetes & obesity research. The 
objective of this application is to create an NIH Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in CNS 
Metabolism (CNS-Met). This proposal builds on existing strengths at UK as well as strengths of both the senior 
and junior investigators in brain physiology, neuropathology, and CNS metabolism. The CNS-Met 
Administrative Core (Admin Core) will coordinate communication and access among the CNS-Met groups, the 
above-mentioned metabolism-centric research programs, and other existing UK strengths as well as core 
facilities established by other UK COBREs to support a multidisciplinary, team-based program that trains the 
next generation of faculty focused on brain metabolism. The CNS-Met Administrative Core is directed by Dr. 
Matthew Gentry and co-directed by Dr. Patrick Sullivan, senior scientists with complementary expertise in CNS 
metabolism and demonstrated leadership skills. The Core will ensure and provide effective coordination and 
oversight of research projects, research cores usage and service, general infrastructure, administrative, and 
fiscal matters. It will provide robust and timely financial management and will facilitate internal communication 
between CNS-Met constituents. It will be responsible for coordinating the recruitment of future research project 
leaders and mentors and for managing and implementing pilot program funding. The Admin Core will do all of 
these activities while ensuring that CNS-Met activities are in compliance with federal regulations. The 
overarching goal of the CNS-Met Administrative Core is to deliver administrative, fiscal, and scientific 
leadership and center-wide coordination to COBRE Research Project Leaders, their mentors, research 
core, and other COBRE-supported investigators. To achieve these goals, the core will: 1) Coordinate 
operational and fiscal management, infrastructure and program planning, and communication processes 
across all COBRE components.; and 2) Facilitate and coordinate research training, mentoring, and career 
development activities for early-stage investigators in brain metabolism research; 3) Implement a pilot studies 
program to seed new research across neuroscience research thrusts; and 4) Provide effective formative and 
summative assessment of COBRE projects and activities of the CNS-Met group."
10841478,"Neurological disorders and central nervous system (CNS) injuries show clear metabolic defects, which in
turn disrupts bioenergetics balances, redox status, and neurotransmitter biosynthesis that are required for
maintaining, synaptic activity, neuronal homeostasis, and neuroinflammation. For these reasons, CNS
metabolism research has generated interest from those studying Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury,
epilepsy, spinal cord injury, Parkinson’s disease, and others. Modern metabolomics allows for the profiles of
hundreds of metabolites from a single sample. It is both informative and transformative, supports both
hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-driven research. Current applications of metabolomics include,
molecular basis of metabolic diseases, biomarker discovery, disease prediction, drug responses, and
personalized medicine.
 The overarching goal of the CNS-Met Metabolomics Core is to make cutting-edge metabolomics and
mitochondrial energetics techniques and analyses available to CNS-Met Research Project Leaders (RPL) and
pilot project PIs. The available expertise and instrumentation are well-aligned with the RPL proposals. The core
directors have worked with each RPL to generate exciting preliminary data. The core will engage with, assist in
experimental design, run samples, train personnel, and analyze brain metabolism data. The CNS-Met
Metabolomics Core will support the talented RPLs in the area of CNS metabolism and enhance their success
in competing for NIH R-level grants.
 To achieve these goals, the core will Aim 1: Provide experimental design consultation and project-specific
study planning. The core has worked closely with the RPLs, and will continue to do so, on experimental design,
data processing, and biostatistical analyses. Proper experimental design and sample preparation will lay the
foundation for a successful metabolomics experiment. Aim 2: Provide metabolomics expertise and training.
The core will house an Agilent 5977B GCMS, 2) Agilent 6545 quadrupole time of flight LC/CE-QTOF, and 3) a
Seahorse Biosciences XF24e and XFe96 Flux Analyzers as well as Oroboros O2KFluorometer. The core will
run samples, assist, train, and/or supervise data analysis from basic data reduction, incorporating procedural
control, normalization, pathway ontology matching, data interpretation, and offer possible next steps. Aim 3:
Perform sample processing, technical analyses, and data reduction-interpretation-presentation. The core will
assist users by performing sample preparation, instrument operation, mass spectrometry peak matching to
metabolites with a known compound library, sample normalization, and statistical analyses.
 The core will utilize integrated processes established by core leadership from experimental design though
rapid and consistent sample acquisition, sample fixation, sample extraction, data reduction, statistical analysis,
data analysis, and biological interpretation to ensure the success of the CNS-Met RPLs and pilot project PIs."
10922668,"Despite Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL), motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of death and
injury for US adolescents. GDL typically applies to those <18 and restricts initial driving experience to lower
risk conditions; however, these drivers <18 years enter licensure underprepared and have the highest crash
rates. New evidence from our R21 showed an association between decreased crash rates and man-
dated driver education and training in the context of GDL in Ohio, but few states require such training.
In Ohio, which requires GDL and professional behind-the-wheel (BTW) training for licensure before 18 (those
>18, exempt from GDL and training), those licensed <18 years demonstrate lower crash rates, higher licensing
exam pass rates, and safer performance on a validated virtual driving assessment (VDA) than those licensed
at 18. By contrast, Pennsylvania and most other states have no professional training requirements for young
drivers, which can largely be attributed to the negative results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of pre-
licensure training in DeKalb in 1983. Our Ohio results and major safety advances since DeKalb (GDL,
stronger national driver training standards, and online training to address novice driver errors) moti-
vated our proposed RCT of training (the 1st RCT in 3 decades). We propose a Phase III 3-arm RCT involv-
ing 1000 adolescent novice drivers balanced by ages 16-18 years. With usual care in PA (GDL) as control, we
will test 2 training interventions: Arm 2, ACCEL, an online training in hazard anticipation/response and atten-
tion maintenance and Arm 3, 8 hours of state-of-the-art BTW training. We will examine 3 outcomes: (1)
Smartphone-monitored driving from start of intervention period through 6 months post-licensure, (2) PA license
exam result; and (3) VDA performance at licensure. Participants will be recruited from 5 Philadelphia-area
practice sites (2 urban, 2 suburban, 1 rural) as part of routine adolescent care. All participants will undergo
baseline assessment of driving performance (VDA) and a neurocognitive and personality battery. Aim 1: De-
termine the effect of ACCEL or BTW training versus usual care on driving crash risk (e.g., rates of hard brak-
ing) during the first 6 months post-licensure. Hypotheses: (1) Both ACCEL and BTW will reduce early licensure
crash risk. (2) ACCEL will produce greater reduction in crash risk than BTW training because ACCEL targets
skills that reduce crash risk. Aim 2: Determine the effect of ACCEL or BTW training versus usual care on skill
acquisition. Hypotheses: (1) Both ACCEL and BTW will improve skill acquisition. (2) ACCEL will produce fewer
errors on the VDA measure of skills than BTW; however, BTW may produce better license exam performance
(e.g., parallel parking). Aim 3: Identify age-related risk factors for crashes that are resistant to training. Hypoth-
eses: ACCEL and BTW will mitigate cognitive skills but will be less successful for impulse/personality differ-
ences related to risky driving practices. The expected R01 results will directly inform policy and provide guid-
ance for future clinical practice."
10800680,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI) is a traumatic perinatal neuromuscular injury causing muscle paralysis and
lifelong arm impairment. Muscle paralysis in these children also leads to bone and joint consequences, including
deformed growth of the scapula and humerus. BPBI occurs during a critical period of rapid musculoskeletal
growth, but the parallel postnatal interactions of muscle and bone that drive these persistent deformities are not
understood. Clinical reports and preliminary work suggest that short, contracted muscles after injury can alter
mechanical loading of the shoulder consistent with observed bone deformity at macro- and microstructural levels.
Altered active limb function with reduced range of motion and load bearing is also present; disuse is known to
alter tissue growth and maturation. Finally, nerve injury in other conditions also affects bone growth directly, and
direct effects in the postnatal period are not clear. Identifying appropriate targets for future treatment requires
understanding which factors associated with altered bone and muscle development are most critical for driving
altered growth. Almost nothing is known about the timing and progression of changes in underlying bone and
muscle structure or metabolism following nerve injury occurring at birth to provide a foundation for clinical
decision-making. Our primary hypothesis is that the bone deformity following BPBI is driven primarily by the
mechanical environment, derived from impaired longitudinal growth of paralyzed muscle and altered active
functional loading beginning shortly after injury. We will apply our unique rodent and computational models of
BPBI that probe the separate contributions of nerve injury and muscle contracture to perform complementary
assessments of the relative contributions of nerve injury, passive muscle loading, and active functional loading
following BPBI to bone deformity. We will do so using 1) previously validated rat neurectomy models of brachial
plexus injury and our unique disarticulation model of altered loading and 2) an integrated computational model
to determine which specific features of bone deformity following BPBI are driven primarily by each potential
driver. This R01 project, conducted by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in orthopedic surgery and
biomechanical engineering, has high potential to elucidate the role of denervation in the parallel development of
bone and muscle that occurs postnatally. Our innovative study design permits us to isolate both direct neural
effects and indirect effects from altered passive and active mechanical loading on bone development in a way
that has not previously been possible. Ultimately, this work has the potential to shift current research and
treatment paradigms from an isolated focus on muscle as a treatment target to an integrated muscle and bone
approach based on driving factors of deformity and loss of function. We anticipate our results will provide new
candidates for improved treatment of BPBI and other neuromuscular injuries."
10769874,"ABSTRACT
Proper control of stem cell division is critical for tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. When dysregulated, it
can lead to hypoplasia and stem cell exhaustion on the one hand, or tissue overgrowth and cancer on the other.
But mitosis is more than simple proliferation, as cell division can be controlled not only in time but also in space.
Oriented cell divisions (OCDs) are an example of the latter, and for stem and progenitor cells, choices between
division axes can dictate cell fate outcomes and impact tissue architecture. In stratified epithelia such as the
epidermis, basal progenitors divide either within the plane of the epithelium, or perpendicular to it. Evidence
suggests that planar divisions are generally self-renewing symmetric cell divisions (SCDs) while perpendicular
divisions are differentiative asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs). Previous work from our lab has shown that ACDs
are directed by a complex of polarity and spindle orientation proteins—converging on the critical scaffolding
protein LGN (Gpsm2)—which localize asymmetrically at the apical cell cortex. More recently, we have found that
the paralog AGS3 (Gpsm1) seems to oppose LGN, and functions in promoting SCDs through an unknown
mechanism. In addition, we recently made the surprising discovery that division orientation is not fixed during
metaphase, as previously thought, but can be further refined during late stages of mitosis. In this process, which
we term “telophase correction,” roughly one-third of basal cells enter anaphase at oblique angles, but then
reorient to either planar or perpendicular. We have learned that cell-cell adhesions—specifically, the
mechanosensing components of the adherens junction—are important for telophase correction to occur, and
can operate independently of LGN. This demonstrates that in addition to intrinsic cues such as the LGN complex,
extrinsic factors such as the local tissue microenvironment influence the final division axis. Despite what we and
others have learned about the molecular control of ACDs, major knowledge gaps exist in understanding how
oriented divisions shape tissue architecture both during normal development and in congenital skin diseases
such as epidermolysis bullosa and ectodermal dysplasia. Specifically, the objectives of this proposal are to
develop a better understanding of 1) what regulates SCDs and how the choice between SCD/ACD is made
(SA1), 2) how cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix, and local cell density impact division orientation and fate decisions
(SA2). To achieve these goals, we will leverage a combination of innovative approaches, centered on our rapid,
high-throughput technique—lentiviral ultrasound-guided gene inactivation and gene expression (LUGGIGE)—
which we will utilize to generate mouse models of both gene loss and of specific mutations found in human
diseases. Combined with ex vivo imaging of skin explants and in vivo proteomic approaches to characterize the
LGN and AGS3 interactomes using TurboID, these comprehensive studies will provide insights into the cell-
intrinsic and extrinsic cues that determine division orientation, and how they operate during normal epidermal
growth and in blistering and dysplastic skin diseases."

 Immunotherapy has made an enormous impact in the treatment of multiple types of cancer, however
most patients fail to benefit and methods to monitor response are lacking. To bridge this gap, we have developed
non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to interrogate immune activity in the tumor
microenvironment. Immune cell release of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a hallmark of CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) and
Th1-mediated immune activity, both of which contribute to anti-tumor immunity. Our results thus far show that
antibody-based immunoPET tracers targeting IFN-γ can detect anti-tumor immunity after administration of
immunotherapy, which correlates to treatment outcomes in preclinical tumor models. The current proposal will
advance these studies by examining the potential of IFN-γ PET as a pre-treatment predictor of immunotherapy
response. We will utilize novel Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred mouse models developed during the
course of this project, which exhibit a wide range of response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) due to
select variants in their genetic background. These models mimic the diversity of the human population, yet limit
tumor heterogeneity as a variable by utilizing genetically identical tumor lines, allowing us to focus on the role of
host immunity. We find pre-existing intratumoral IFN-γ expression correlates to ICI outcomes in these models,
and we will now test whether IFN-γ PET imaging prior to therapy is predictive of ICI response. Positive results
will support the use of IFN-γ PET as part of the formulation of patient treatment strategy. In a necessary step for
clinical translation, we will also prepare to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application. Dosimetry,
stability studies, and toxicology will be performed. Collectively, the proposed studies will support the clinical use
of IFN-γ PET to address critical unmet needs, including predictive biomarker discovery and treatment monitoring
technology for cancer immunotherapy. While this proposal focuses on oncology, immune monitoring
technologies may also have additional application in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune conditions."

Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) can affect up to 80% of PD patients and lead to
enormous societal cost. These symptoms involve impaired executive functions such as working memory,
attention, behavioral flexibility, and timing, and can progress to psychosis, hallucinations, and dementia.
There are few therapies that improve cognitive function in PD. Thus, there is a critical need to better
understand the fundamental mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction that occurs in PD. Our long-term goal
is to elucidate the mechanisms by which cognitive dysfunction occurs in PD patients in order to develop
new targeted treatments.
PD involves death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA). These neurons
send mesocortical projections to key cognitive cortical areas such as the prefrontal cortex. It is unknown
how VTA dopamine neurons are involved in cognitive processes that malfunction in human PD patients.
Our goal in this proposal is to harness cell-type specific rodent models to characterize VTA dopamine
neuronal function in cognitive processes relevant to PD. Our preliminary data demonstrates interval-
timing variability correlates with PD-related cognitive dysfunction. Our rodent research demonstrates that
VTA dopamine is necessary for interval timing, prefrontal timing-related modulations and prefrontal 4 Hz
rhythms. Here, we will combine optogenetics, fiber photometry, and neuronal ensemble recordings in
transgenic mice to interrogate VTA dopamine projections with cell-type-specificity and millisecond
resolution. We will test the overall hypothesis that VTA dopamine neurons engage cognitive processing
in the prefrontal cortex. In Aim 1 we will determine how silencing VTA dopamine neurons impacts
cognitive processing. In Aim 2 we will define how VTA dopamine neuron dynamics predict cognitive
processing. In Aim 3 we will determine how stimulating VTA dopamine neurons impacts cognitive
processing.
This proposal is broadly significant in determining when and how VTA dopamine engages prefrontal
cognitive processing. Although this is a basic-science proposal focused on VTA dopamine neurons, our
results will guide new therapies for human PD. This work could contribute to biomarkers for PD and for
other Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)."
10795111,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The immune system remarkably distinguishes between self and non-self/self-aberrant antigens, affording
exquisite anti-tumor specificity and inhibition of tumorigenesis. However, tumor immunosurveillance is
unfortunately opposed by tumor cell evasion of the immune response. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
targeting PD-1, PD-L1, CD40 and others, as well as adoptive cell transfer (CAR-T, bulk TILs) favorably modulate
this equilibrium for therapeutic benefit. However, response rates are often incomplete, progressive disease is
common, and predictive biomarkers are suboptimal.
 The development of next-generation immunotherapies has been hindered by a lack of in vitro models
that functionally recapitulate syngeneic interactions between tumor and infiltrating immune cells. In response,
we have developed organoid methods that culture primary human tumor biopsies together with their infiltrating
immune components as a cohesive unit without reconstitution. These “patient-derived tumor organoids” (PDO)
preserve tumor cells alongside endogenous T, B, NK cells and macrophages, robustly recapitulate the T cell
receptor clonotype repertoire of the original tumor, and crucially, manifest tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)
expansion, activation and tumor cell killing in response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies (Cell, 2018).
The PDO system thus represents a holistic organoid model of human tumor-immune interactions.
 Here, we leverage the PDO technique to investigate immunotherapeutic mechanisms and
treatments in PD-1-responsive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma, exploiting
pre- and post-treatment human biopsies and mouse models. Aim 1 hypothesizes that checkpoint inhibition
induces a complex and sequential network response involving immune-tumor and immune-immune crosstalk.
Thus, Aim 1 employs the ability to perform serial time-course sampling of PDOs to define a single cell RNA-seq
network cellular crosstalk model of the early anti-PD-1-stimulated anti-tumor immune response over multiple
acute time points typically inaccessible to clinical biopsies performed after months. Importantly, comparison of
this immune propagation in responding versus non-responding mouse and human organoids will define nodal
points conferring resistance. Aim 2 improves bulk TIL adoptive transfer immunotherapy by using PDOs as living
bioreactors to enrich tumor-reactive mouse and human melanoma TILs by anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition,
followed by testing of enhanced anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, Aim 3 performs a co-treatment
trial comparing anti-PD-1 responses of pre-treatment biopsy cSCC PDOs to clinical outcomes. Further, post-
treatment biopsy PDOs are re-challenged with anti-PD-1 and a novel agent inactivating PD-1 by
dephosphorylation. We thus utilize the holistic PDO model preserving endogenous tumor epithelial and immune
components en bloc to investigate and improve cancer immunotherapy via our team of Calvin Kuo (organoids),
Mark Davis and Chris Garcia (tumor immunology) and Anne Chang and Dimitri Colevas (cSCC clinicians)."

Myofibroblasts are differentiated mesenchymal cells with identified roles in development, cancer, tissue
repair/remodeling. Regulation of myofibroblast differentiation involves multiple signaling pathways and
respective downstream transcription factors as well as significant modulation by epigenetic factors such as
DNA methylation. Abundant studies focused on identification of transcription factors and their role in regulation
of the α-smooth muscle actin (Acta2) gene as a marker of differentiation, but the mechanism of epigenetic
regulation is not as well understood. Select CpG islands in the Acta2 gene are differentially methylated in
myofibroblasts vs. fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Impairment of DNA methylation enhances differentiation
while the converse inhibits differentiation. Active demethylation by the Tet (Ten-eleven translocation) proteins,
which are methylcytosine dioxygenases, is implicated in cell differentiation. Their importance in cell
differentiation is suggested in studies of embryonal and other stem cells, but their significance in regulation of
myofibroblast differentiation is unknown. Preliminary data showed selective induction of Tet1 and not the other
2 isoforms (Tet2 and Tet3) in myofibroblast differentiation, while Tet1 deficiency caused impaired differentiation
both in vivo and in vitro. Thus the selective importance of the Tet1 isoform is suggested in differentiation. While
Tet1 does not globally regulate all genes by demethylation, the identity of at least one Tet1 regulated target
gene, Acta2 could be inferred from the preliminary data. Based on the previous findings and preliminary data
we hypothesized that Tet1 importantly regulates myofibroblast differentiation by demethylation of regulatory
DNA sequences in select target genes essential for the differentiation process. Select recruitment to the
relevant target DNA sequences is mediated by Tet1 binding proteins/transcription factors with binding
specificity for these DNA regions. To test this hypothesis the Specific Aims are as follows, 1) to screen for and
identify Tet1 target genes important in myofibroblast differentiation in fibroblasts, 2) to study the mechanism of
Tet1 regulation of key target genes essential for myofibroblast differentiation, and 3) to assess the in vivo
significance of Tet1 regulation of myofibroblast differentiation. The studies will use epigenomic approaches to
assess differentially methylated genes and transgenic mice to evaluate the biological importance of Tet1 and
select differentiation relevant genes in specific cell types in vivo. Achievement of the goals will shed new light
on the epigenetic regulation of myofibroblast differentiation of relevance to development, cancer and tissue
repair/remodeling."

Coccidioidomycosis is a re-emerging infection that NIH has prioritized for vaccine prevention. An experimental
vaccine of live attenuated spores is highly protective after intranasal delivery. We propose to study this vaccine
to define mechanisms by which lung epithelium regulates durable mucosal T cell immunity. Resistance against
inhaled microbes is thought to reside within tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but little is known about how this
intranasal vaccine induces lung TRM. Our preliminary data reveal that the vaccine elicits protective, Coccidioides
endoglucanase 2 (C-Eng2) specific CD4+ T cells and that bronchiolar club cells and Ca++ calcineurin signaling in
the cells are needed to mobilize inflammatory and T cells in response to vaccine. We also find that Microfold (M)
cells descend from the bronchiolar club cells and facilitate T cell priming in response to the vaccine.
 From these preliminary data, we hypothesize that bronchiolar club cells and M cells regulate mucosal
cellular immunity in response to intranasal vaccine. To test this hypothesis, we have created innovative tools: (i)
transgenic mice to deplete epithelial cell subsets or their products to further define their role in inducing immunity;
(ii) C-Eng2 specific tetramers to track and analyze protective CD4+ T cells and TRM in C57BL6 mice; and (iii)
methods to isolate and culture human lung epithelial cells to translate results from mice to humans. We propose
three aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will elucidate early stages of the inflammatory response to
intranasal vaccine regulated by bronchiolar club cells and M cells; in Aim 2, we will identify lung epithelial cell
receptors - dectin-1, DUOX1 and DUOXA1 - and downstream PLCG2 that may sense intranasal vaccine and
signal via Ca++ and calcineurin to mobilize mucosal immunity; and in Aim 3, we will define mechanisms of
vaccine-induced durable mucosal immunity by studying lung TRM and the regulatory role of lung epithelium.
 In sum, we address the unmet need of vaccination against coccidioidomycosis. Our work is significant as
it will define mechanisms by which a promising vaccine establishes T cell immunity at the lung mucosa. Results
will identify tactics useful for other vaccine immunogens given intranasally, including subunit vaccines. The work
will define correlates of immunity needed to advance this attenuated vaccine or next generation subunit vaccines
against this high priority pathogen. The work will be done with state-of-the-art, cutting-edge tools. Our team of
PI and Co-I’s will let us translate results from mouse to human, with tools and reagents for human lung epithelium."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of a few cancers with more than double the mortality for black men, making this
one of the greatest racial disparities in cancer. Although there are documented disparities in PCa incidence
and mortality related to where people live, it is unclear how residential histories of patients contribute to their
PCa outcomes. Residential environments vary greatly by race and socioeconomics (SES). Still little is known
about how longitudinal exposures to neighborhood risk factors and structural racism captured years before a
cancer diagnosis and into survivorship contribute to PCa disparities along the cancer care continuum.
Additionally, disease outcomes and disparities in PCa are moderated by patient age. Residential history
during midlife is one of the factors that likely influences PCa incidence, progression, mortality, and overall care
of survivors. We propose an innovative linkage of PA cancer registry data to hospital billing records from the
PA Healthcare Cost Containment Council and ~30 years of LexisNexis address data to provide characteristics
of census tracts where patients live. We will use Pennsylvania (PA) Cancer Registry data (N~20,000 patients
in Southeastern PA) to determine the relationship between longitudinal neighborhood characteristics (poverty
trajectories, historical redlining, lending bias, and gentrification) and PCa outcomes at critical points along the
cancer care continuum in a diverse and historic region. These various characteristics will be used to determine
best practices to examine residential histories in risk modeling for PCa outcomes. We will take a novel life
course approach to addressing the role of residential history on
PCa disparities. We hypothesize that cumulative exposures as well
as exposures to neighborhood risk factors during critical periods in
the PCa care trajectory influence disease characteristics at
diagnosis and PCa-mortality. Multilevel regression models will be
conducted to evaluate independent associations of multi-level
factors with PCa outcomes. We will also examine modification by
age. The information that we learn from this study will help us to
understand ways to integrate residential history in cancer research
and strategize about effective interventions to promote prostate
health among high-risk adult populations
We propose a longitudinal, ambidirectional study to address the
following aims: Aim 1: To examine the relationships between PCa
disparities and residential characteristics at diagnosis; Aim 2: To We will employ a life-course framework in this
examine relationships between PCa disparities and accumulated cancer disparities research (based on Ory, et al.
residential history; Aim 3: To examine how residential exposures 2014, AJPM). Disparities occur within an

disparities; Aim 4: Conduct a community needs assessment in particular life stages provide unique opportunities

Chromatin remodeling and protein synthesis are tightly regulated processes that impact gene expression and
cellular phenotypes. However, it is unknown to what extent these two regulatory mechanisms may be linked or
independent in controlling normal epithelial physiology and disease states. We have uncovered a new functional
relationship between the chromatin remodeler ARID1A and mRNA translation elongation. This link is involved in
maintaining cellular fitness in the context of bladder carcinogenesis and represents a new tumor suppressive
mechanism we call transcriptional-translational conflict. Loss of ARID1A triggers a simultaneous increase in
oncogenic transcripts, but also inhibition of the translation elongation factor eEF2, which results in a reduction in
protein synthesis and prevents cancer pathogenesis. However, this process can be reversed by restoring
translation elongation, which enables the efficient synthesis of oncogenic mRNAs and cancer progression. This
finding provides a unified gene expression model which explains why ARID1A is a context specific tumor
suppressor. Importantly, ARID1A deficient tumors retain a sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of translation
elongation initiation. Recently, our laboratory has developed and characterized new in vitro and in vivo models
of both human and murine ARID1A deficient bladder cancer where we can also toggle translation elongation.
We have used these models to discover a critical link between ARID1A and the process of mRNA translation
elongation that is vital for urothelial homeostasis and bladder cancer progression. We hypothesize that
transcriptional-translational conflict in urothelium lacking ARID1A is mediated through decreased eukaryotic
elongation factor 2 (eEF2) activity, which when reversed unleashes a poised druggable oncogenic program
sufficient to drive cancer progression. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models and
primary organoid systems, whole transcriptome polysome profiling, and patient derived xenografts to definitively
investigate the fundamental link between ARID1A and protein synthesis regulation in a highly relevant population
of bladder cancer patients. To do so, we will address the following aims: 1) Determine the relevance and
mechanism of transcriptional-translational conflict in urothelial cell transformation and carcinogenesis; and 2)
Elucidate how gene expression parity enables cancer progression and represents a context specific therapeutic
vulnerability. This research will help us gain a deeper understanding of the biology of bladder cancer and open
a new paradigm for treating patients with lethal disease. Our work is particularly important for the progress of
precision medicine because it seeks to mechanistically tie a highly prevalent bladder cancer genotype (ARID1A
loss) to a new treatment modality that holds therapeutic promise for bladder cancer patients."
10798203,"Summary
This project helps address challenges neurobiologists face when trying to interpret the results of
genomics and genetics studies, in which a typical aim is to identify candidate genes and
regulatory pathways relevant to normal or disease processes. A common approach is to use
gene network analysis to position findings in a systems biology context. However, identification
of relevant patterns in complex data remains difficult. Our past work resulted in a large database
of expression profiling data, “Gemma” (now over 10,000 studies, including 3,200 relating to the
nervous system) and an extensive series of analyses. This work led to the identification of
specific biases and confounds affecting gene network analysis and gene annotations, and the
development of improved approaches and tools for gene function prediction, gene set
enrichment and cellular composition analysis. Recently we have shown that much of the
variance of expression in brain data sets comes from differences in cellular composition among
samples. Building on this and other work, we propose to extend our research to further the
interpretability of gene expression patterns in the nervous system. Our first aim is to continue
the development of our transcriptomic re-analysis databases, with the expected addition of
approximately 2,500 additional brain-related studies, and an expansion into single-cell
transcriptomics. Our second aim is to assemble and evaluate a high-quality dataset of
transcription factor regulatory targets in brain using a combination of manual curation of the
literature and integration of chromatin immunoprecipitation with transcription factor perturbation
studies along with third-party sources. The third aim brings these topics together to further the
extent to which transcriptomic data can be used to infer changes in regulatory influences in both
single-cell and bulk-tissue data. We hypothesize that our approaches will allow increased
resolution of transcription-factor regulated patterns of co-expression and differential expression.
We will then apply these interpretational tools to re-analyze bulk and single-cell data sets in
neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, and to study candidate genes identified
via genetic association of rare or common variants. All of our data and software will be freely
disseminated via web applications, programmatic interfaces and downloadable data sets."
10810732,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an asymptomatic disease of high mortality rate (65% to 85%) if rupture
occurs. Surgical repair is the only effective treatment, but limited to eligible patients (about 10% of total). No
effective pharmacological approach has been identified to limit AAA progression and rupture. Male sex is an
important risk factor for AAA, with about 4-6:1 male to female prevalence ratio. The reasons for this sex
disparity are unknown, but the delayed onset of AAA in women suggests that estrogen and its receptors (ERs)
may play a role in reducing the prevalence of AAA. Administration of estrogen has protective effects in AAA
animal models through reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators and the proteolytic pathway. However, long-
term estrogen therapy cannot be widely applied to treat AAA patients due to undesirable side-effects. Human
genetic studies uncovered that Kruppel-like factor 14 (KLF14) is robustly associated with chronic metabolic
diseases with a sex difference. We previously reported the biological function of KLF14 and its activator,
perhexiline, clinically used to treat angina and heart failure, in lipid metabolism and demonstrate the strong
anti-inflammatory effect of KLF14. Our preliminary data described herein established that macrophage-
selective Klf14 knockout mice showed significantly increased AAA incidence rates in females, comparable to
those in males, suggesting impaired protective effects of estrogen/ERα/β pathway. Besides the inhibitory
effects of KLF14 on the inflammatory response and MMP-9 activity, we further found that estrogen upregulates
the expression of KLF14 while KLF14, in turn, is a critical transcription factor upregulating the expression of
ERα/β in macrophages, uncovering a feedforward loop that may contribute to the observed sex disparity.
Perhexiline increased the levels of ERα/β in a KLF14-dependent manner. A cholesterol metabolite, 24-
hydroxycholesterol (24HC), functioned as an endogenous ERα/β agonistic molecule and enhanced the anti-
inflammatory effect of perhexiline in macrophages. Most importantly, administration of perhexiline significantly
reduced AAA dissection/rupture and increased survival rate in male mice. Based on our preliminary findings,
the proposed project will test the central hypothesis that KLF14 protects against AAA development/dissection
/rupture by suppressing inflammation and enhancing ERα/β-dependent protective roles in macrophages. The
specific aims will 1) define that macrophage KLF14 is an important regulator of sex differences in AAA mouse
models; 2) determine how KLF14 regulates the estrogen/ERs pathway which contributes to sex-dimorphic
protective effects on AAA; and 3) determine that activation of KLF14 inhibits development/dissection/rupture in
AAA mouse models. Based on the sex-specific functions of KLF14 in AAA, this mechanistic research will
establish KLF14 as a novel therapeutic target and will set a solid foundation towards clinical utilization of
KLF14 activators, like perhexiline, as a viable drug therapy for AAA, with the potential to change current
treatment paradigms for AAA."
10927206,"A growing number of patients with advanced heart failure are undergoing HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott, Abbott
Park, IL) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation around the world. Despite contemporary durable
mechanical support of the heart, LVAD recipients continue to demonstrate low levels of physical activity and
functional capacity, characterized by daily steps and six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance, even 1-year after
surgery. In addition, LVAD recipients frequently meet criteria for prefrailty/frailty and associated sarcopenia,
including low muscle strength and muscle quantity. These deficits may contribute to increased healthcare
utilization in this high-risk population.
 Walking and strengthening exercises can help to improve muscle strength and quantity as well as
physical activity and capacity, but exercise interventions in LVAD recipients are not well established. A large
proportion of LVAD recipients do not participate in center-based, supervised cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and
patients participating in CR initiate therapy a mean of 3 months after hospital discharge. A home-based exercise
program using mobile technology may allow patients to begin exercise rehabilitation at an earlier time after LVAD
implantation. We are conducting a randomized, controlled pilot study of a home-based exercise program
including walking and strengthening exercises with a standardized protocol to guide exercise prescription and
exercise progression based on data obtained from an activity tracking watch and smartphone app. Our pilot data
suggest that our innovative home-based exercise program is feasible, safe, and may be associated with a greater
increase in daily physical activity in patients newly implanted with a HM3 LVAD.
 The effects of a home-based exercise program using mobile technology on daily physical activity and
capacity, frailty and sarcopenia, and quality of life in LVAD recipients have not been previously studied in a
multicenter study. We propose a randomized study of 80 newly implanted HM3 LVAD patients at 4 LVAD centers.
Following index hospital discharge after LVAD implantation, patients will be enrolled and randomized to a 6-
month novel exercise program using mobile technology or usual care (UC). We will evaluate the following specific
aims: Specific Aim #1 is to compare the effects of the exercise intervention vs. UC on physical activity and
capacity measured by a) daily steps (captured by the activity monitor) and b) 6MWT distance. Specific Aim #2
is to compare the effects of the exercise intervention vs. UC on frailty and sarcopenia, by evaluating a) frailty
status and b) muscle quantity. Specific Aim #3 is to compare the effects of the exercise intervention vs. UC on
quality of life (measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12). Specific Aim #4 is to evaluate
the cost-benefit of the exercise intervention vs. UC. Findings from this study have the potential to improve low
physical activity and capacity, frailty and sarcopenia, quality of life, and increased rates of healthcare utilization
in the growing population of LVAD recipients."
10792612,"The prevalence of alcohol use disorders and consequent tissue injury, primarily alcoholic liver disease (ALD)
continue to increase. Skeletal muscle loss or sarcopenia is a consistent abnormality in patients with ALD and is
associated with adverse clinical outcomes that include increased mortality, other complications of liver disease
and poor post-liver transplant outcomes. We have recently reported more severe muscle loss and a greater
rate of muscle loss in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis compared with those in other causes of cirrhosis. Despite
the high clinical significance of sarcopenia in ALD there are no effective therapeutic options because the
underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We also reported that ethanol, directly and indirectly via
impaired hepatic ammonia disposal and consequent hyperammonemia, results in a sarcopenic phenotype with
dysregulated protein homeostasis (proteostasis). In preliminary studies, we have shown mitochondrial
dysfunction in response to ethanol and hyperammonemia. We also noted that ethanol results in cataplerosis or
loss of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, specifically α-ketoglutarate (αKG) an inhibitor of HIF1α.
Consistently, unbiased approaches (assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing), and targeted
experiments showed oxygen independent stabilization of muscle hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) with
ammonia. In pilot studies, we observed an increased expression of REDD1, a transcriptional target of HIF1α
and a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that maintains skeletal
muscle proteostasis with functional responses. We also noted relative preservation of muscle mass during
hyperammonemia in muscle specific deletion of HIF1α mice. These observations formed the basis for our
hypothesis that ethanol induced hyperammonemia causes cataplerosis of αKG with oxygen independent
stabilization and impaired proteostasis and sarcopenia. We will test this hypothesis by testing if ethanol
stabilizes HIF1α in skeletal muscle, and determine the mechanisms of stabilization of muscle HIF1α. Ethanol
treatment in vitro in myotubes and in vivo in mice with loss and gain of function of HIF1α and its regulatory
molecules will be used for these studies We will also test how metabolic perturbations regulate HIF1α
stabilization and consequent molecular and functional responses in our preclinical models. Validation of key
observations will be done in human muscle tissue from our biorepository. The proposed studies will enhance
our understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia in ALD and lay the foundation for targeted therapeutics.
This award will provide the support and time for the applicant for a supervised research career development in
translational research. The applicant works with NIAAA funded independent investigators in the Northern Ohio
Alcohol Center and her mentor developed the field of sarcopenia in liver disease. The institutional environment
is highly supportive of her career path towards becoming an independent physician scientist focusing on
mechanistic approaches to address unmet clinical needs in patients with alcohol use disorders."
10788402,"Project Summary/Abstract
Myalgic enchephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disorder affecting numerous organ
systems and biological processes. Published data seems to suggest that ME/CFS may be preceded by infection,
and the chronic manifestation of illness may represent an altered host response to infection, or an inability to
resolve inflammation. Previous studies focused on perturbation in cytokines and metabolism have also shown
that CD8 T responses are decreased in ME/CFS. In preliminary studies we examined the frequency, functional
and phenotypic status of CD8 T cells to determine whether they were altered in chronic ME/CFS donors as
compared to healthy donors. We observed an increased CD4:CD8 ratio, altered expression of
exhaustion/activation markers like CTLA4 and 2B4 on CD8 T cells, and decreased production of IFN, TNF
and CD107a/b upregulation following PMA stimulation, all suggesting CD8 T cell exhaustion. This was
associated with a, perhaps compensatory increased frequency of activated CD4+CD8+ T cells in the ME/CFS
donors as compared to healthy controls. Notably, a subset of the CD8 and the CD4+CD8+ T cell populations
were spontaneously producing atypical cytokines, subdividing ME/CFS donors into two subsets: type 1 had an
increased frequency of FoxP3+helios+ Treg-like cells producing IL9 (female donors); type 2 had FoxP3+helios-
cells producing IL17 (male donors). When we examined the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of the CD4+CD8+ T
cell population we found evidence of antigen driven clonal expansions to an unknown antigen at this time,
whether it will be a viral or auto-antigen. We hypothesize that the common theme in ME/CFS is an aberrant
response to an immunological trigger like infection, which results in a permanently dysregulated immune system
as a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion. These studies will identify potential biomarkers and mechanisms driving
the immunopathogenesis of ME/CFS leading to future therapies. We will explore this hypothesis in the following
Aims. Aim 1 we will examine altered CD8 and CD4+CD8+ T-cell responses in ME/CFS: 1) we will determine if
the level of CD8 T cell exhaustion varies with ME/CFS type 1 (female) and Type 2 (male) response and with the
severity of ME/CFS symptoms using a larger ME/CFS cohort; 2) we will examine EBV antigen-specific responses
in ME/CFS donors to determine if a common persistent virus response is altered by the immunosuppressive
state of CD8 T cell exhaustion and further contributing to the disease state of ME/CFS; 3) microarray analyses
will be done on sorted activated T cell subsets to assist in understanding the alterations in the functionality of the
exhausted and activated CD8 and CD4+CD8+ T cell subsets in ME/CFS donors. In Aim 2 we will examine TCR
repertoire of CD8 and CD4+CD8+ T-cell subsets for evidence of antigen driven clonal expansion. Defining the
characteristics of the activated clonally expanded CD8 and CD4+CD8+ T cells would be a major step in the field
potentially leading to the identification a specific infectious or auto-antigen response that could be the main driver
of CD8 T cell exhaustion and the immunological basis of ME/CFS."
10795874,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Basic and clinical research over the past decade is shedding new light on the major role played
by the nervous system in respiratory pathophysiology, in particular in the “hypertussivity”
associated with chronic unproductive cough, in the “airways hyperresponsiveness””
associated with of asthma, and in the airway narrowing and secretions associated with
COPD. The evidence supports the hypothesis that these hyperactive disorders are in part
secondary to dysregulation of vagal afferent C-fibers that comprise some 75% of the nerves
within the respiratory tract. This grant aims to advance our understanding of the nature of the
inflammatory mediators (autacoids and cytokines) responsible for activating airway C-fibers and
the specific ionic mechanisms underlying this activity. This R35 will replace my two active R01
grants: R01 HL137807 “Mechanisms of Inflammatory Activation of Vagal C-Fibers in the
Respiratory Tract” and R01HL122228 “Control of Airway Sensory Nerve Function by Voltage-
Gated Sodium Channel Subtypes.” The R35 funding will allow us to go beyond the aims of the
R01 grants that focus on healthy animals, and delve into the mechanisms that lead to the
neuroplasticity associated with airway inflammation. In particular, we propose to evaluate the
neuroplasticity in the afferent nervous system that accompanies viral infection during early life
“critical periods” with the hypothesis that such infections cause persistent neuroplastic changes.
These changes lead to a hyperreactive neurophysiological state that can last into adulthood.
This grant will also allow us to continue to advance more user-friendly technologies for studying
airway nerves by taking advantage of modern imaging methodologies. These methods will not
only serve to advance our own studies, they will also likely be exported to other laboratories
interested in visceral neuroscience in general, and airway neuroscience in particular. We will
also continue to advance our techniques and studies into the study of human bronchial
innervation. Finally, the award will help keep the path paved for continued mentoring of young
investigators interested in pursuing airway neuroscience research."
10796854,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Targeting the Genus Leishmania with Small Molecules
 Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Leishmania sp. It
is transmitted by the sandfly vector and manifests in different clinical forms including skin ulcers, mucosa
destruction, damage to visceral organs such as the liver and spleen, and bone marrow damage. The clinical
outcome is determined primarily by the species of the parasite and the immune system of the host. There are
98 countries affected by leishmaniasis with more than 2 million people currently infected and 350 million people
at risk. The spread of leishmaniasis is of particular concern to US citizens in southern states such as Texas and
Oklahoma, where cases have recently been reported, as well as to US military troops stationed abroad in
geopolitically unstable regions where the disease tends to thrive.
 Chemotherapy options for leishmaniasis are limited. Antimonials have been the first line drug for decades
in most endemic countries, despite antimony’s notorious adverse effects, hospitalization requirements and
increasing cases of antimony-resistant parasites. Amphotericin B, the main alternative treatment, also causes
significant harmful side effects. Liposomal formulations are better tolerated, but are prohibitively expensive for
most affected populations. Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, was recently repurposed to treat leishmaniasis and
is the only oral treatment available and approved for use in the US. Miltefosine also has toxicity limitations,
teratogenicity and lack of efficacy against certain Leishmania species. The development of new chemotherapies
to treat the different clinical forms of leishmaniasis is in urgent demand, and is clearly an unmet medical need.
 To address this unmet medical need, Scott Schaus and Lauren Brown from Boston University (BU) will
lead a collaborative project with Jair Lage Siqueira-Neto at the UC San Diego Center for Discovery and
Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (CDIPD), Camila Indiani de Oliveira at FIOCRUZ and Mark Grinstaff at BU to
characterize the activity of antileishmanial small molecules and develop them as systemic and topical
therapeutics. Preliminary work by the team has led to the identification of a chemotype with nanomolar in vitro
efficacy against both visceral- and cutaneous-causative species of the parasite, a suitable pharmacokinetic
profile for in vivo studies, and demonstrated in vivo efficacy in a cutaneous leishmaniasis infection model.
 This grant outlines a proposal to further develop the chemotype and address specific challenges in
antileishmanial drug discovery, including drug target identification, options for dosing and administration, and
most importantly the applicability of the chemotype to treat multiple manifestations of the disease, including those
that are most relevant and endemic to the American continents. Our end goal is to develop at least one pre-
clinical candidate for the treatment of either visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis."
10766771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise or movement therapies, to prevent falls in older
adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been effective. Our long-term goal is to establish a safe
and efficacious mind-body exercise intervention that can be made widely available in community settings and
for clinical practice to prevent falls in a rapidly growing, at-risk population of community-dwelling older adults
with MCI. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate a novel intervention—dual-task Tai Ji Quan: Moving for
Better Balance (Dual-TJQMBB)—that is specifically tailored for older adults with MCI to prevent falls. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that by integrating cognitive exercises with physical (tai ji quan)
movements we address the impaired balance and concomitant attention (dual-tasking) deficits associated with
the increased risk of falling in this population. The central hypothesis is that our therapeutically tailored and
dual-task augmented tai ji quan training approach will be more efficacious than traditional tai ji quan training in
preventing falls. The central hypothesis, with its premise established from our prior work and promising pilot
data, will be tested by pursuing our Primary Aim in which we will determine the efficacy of a 6-month Dual-
TJQMBB intervention in reducing the incidence of falls among older adults with MCI. We will address our
Primary Aim using an innovative e-health (online) intervention delivery approach with a 3-arm, single-blind,
randomized controlled trial involving a test of the comparative efficacy of the two tai ji quan fall prevention
interventions (Dual-TJQMBB, standard TJQMBB) relative to a stretching control. We hypothesize that, by
month 6, participants assigned to the Dual-TJQMBB intervention will show a significant reduction in the
incidence of falls (primary outcome) and improvement in dual-task walking and physical and cognitive
performances (secondary outcomes) compared to those assigned to the stretching control. The project has two
secondary aims: (1) to determine how well the benefits of our Dual-TJQMBB intervention persist over a 6-
month post-intervention follow-up, and (2) to examine whether the impact of Dual-TJQMBB training on
reducing the incidence of falls is mediated by change in dual-task walking performance. Our proposed
research is significant because it will fill a vital gap in clinical practice by providing efficacy evidence about a
tailored fall prevention intervention that combines tai ji quan with cognitive task training, for the first time, for
older adults with MCI who are at risk of falling and continuing cognitive decline. If the evidence supports the
Dual-TJQMBB hypothesis, the proposed study can (a) make a rapid impact on clinical practice guidelines in
the field of fall prevention and (b) have a widespread positive impact very quickly because it can be coupled
with the standard TJQMBB program, which has been broadly disseminated across the country."
10754280,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric solid tumor of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for 15%
of childhood cancer deaths. Tumor cell amplification of the MYCN transcription factor is seen in half of patients
with high-risk disease, where it functions as an oncogenic driver associated with metastatic disease and poor
survival. Amplified MYCN functions as a regulator of cell growth by stimulating the expression of genes that
function in ribosome biogenesis and regulatory elements of protein translation. We have identified the
translation initiation factor eIF4A, an RNA-helicase responsible for overcoming blocks to translation of 5′
untranslated regions (UTRs) to be the predominant regulator of transcript-specific mRNA recruitment in
MYCN-overexpressing NB cells. eIF4A is the primary target of the rocaglate class of protein synthesis
inhibitors, which inhibit translation initiation in a transcript-specific manner by clamping eIF4A onto
polypurine-rich (PP-rich) 5′ UTRs and preventing ribosome scanning. This unique mode of action provides
selectivity for highly proliferative cancer cells in which pro-survival transcripts are preferentially enriched in PP-
rich leaders. MYCN-associated transcripts rank highly in PP-rich 5′ UTR sequences, the majority of which
have critical roles in cell proliferation. From a library screen of amidino-rocaglates (ADRs), novel synthetic
rocaglate analogs developed by co-Investigator, Dr John Porco at Boston University, we identified a
promising candidate, CMLD012824 that disrupts eIF4A activity, thereby inhibiting translation and inducing
selective, dose-dependent cytotoxicity in MYCN-amplified NB cells. We hypothesize that ADR-mediated
inhibition of eIF4A would induce robust and selective cytotoxicity in MYCN-amplified NB cells and
would prove to be a valid therapeutic strategy in this aggressive cancer. In Aim 1, we will develop
potent, highly selective ADRs and newer guanidino-rocaglates (GDRs) that have activity against MYCN-
amplified NB cells and exhibit pharmacological properties that enable in vivo efficacy studies. In Aim 2, we
will investigate the effects of ADR/GDR inhibition in MYCN-amplified NB cell line and tumor models. The
results of these studies will provide preclinical validation of this new class of translation inhibitors for the
treatment of MYCN-amplified NB patients, and propel their development towards clinical application. Our
findings may also be relevant to other cancers that rely on transcriptional addiction and non-canonical
translation initiation mechanisms, thereby broadening the scope of this therapeutic strategy."
10740885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to understand how cellular membrane trafficking machinery controls the packaging
and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes from synapses in vivo. EVs are small membrane-bound
vesicles released by numerous cell types, including neurons, carrying cargoes critical for signaling and
disease. However, we understand very little about how EV cargo traffic is spatially and temporally regulated
within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. We have developed tools to track and manipulate EV
traffic at Drosophila presynaptic terminals in vivo, and discovered that flux of cargoes through a plasma
membrane-recycling endosome route determines whether they are locally sorted for packaging and release in
EVs, rather than depleted from synapses by retrograde transport. Recycling endosomes have primarily been
studied in non-neuronal cells, and very little is known about their lifetime, functions, or dynamics at presynaptic
terminals. We do know that recycling endosomes play critical roles in signaling, neuronal morphogenesis, EV
traffic, and synaptic transmission. Understanding and therapeutically intervening in these important processes
will require a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of neuronal recycling endosome function. In this proposal,
we will elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic EV cargo and recycling endosome traffic in vivo. To achieve
these goals, we will use Drosophila genetics, biochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging.
1) We will determine the functions, dynamics, and regulation of different types of synaptic recycling
endosomes. To this end, we will develop new tools and approaches to define and control functionally distinct
recycling compartments at synapses. Using these tools, we will test novel mechanistic hypotheses for how
membrane traffic machinery sorts cargoes at synaptic recycling compartments. 2) We will determine how EV
cargo traffic depends on distinct modes of synaptic endocytosis: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which operates
under low neuronal activity and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, which operates during intense neuronal
activity. These experiments will ascertain if EV fate is determined by different modes of internalization, how
recycling endosomes contribute to these functions, and provide new mechanisms to link activity, endosomal
traffic, and EV release. Given the conserved nature of synaptic membrane trafficking machinery, our findings
and tools will lay the foundation for new insights into EV traffic in many aspects of nervous system function,
including in human neurological disease."

Acute brain injury causes over 163,000 deaths in the US annually and leaves many more patients with long-
term disability. Preventing secondary brain injury is critical to improving neurologic outcomes in these patients.
Pathological brain electrical activity (measured via EEG) following acute brain injury contributes to long-term
disability via seizures in the acute phase and epilepsy in the chronic phase. EEG is the primary tool for
monitoring aberrant brain activity, yet it is underutilized due to uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of
EEG findings and the high workload associated with interpreting high volumes of EEG data.
Our group has made progress toward addressing these short-comings by developing three novel machine
learning algorithms: 1) a seizure forecasting model for hospitalized patients (“2HELPS2B”); 2) a model that
measures the Burden of Epileptiform Activity (EA—seizures and highly epileptiform patterns such as lateralized
periodic discharges) to predict neurologic outcomes (“BEACON”); and 3) A model that uses EA in the acute
phase of brain injury to predict the risk of developing epilepsy.
This proposal is the culminating step required to translate preliminary studies into actionable clinical tools. In
this prospective multicenter observational study, we will collect clinical and EEG data on 3000 patients with
acute brain injury to further develop and validate these models. Our study leverages an existing multicenter
bioinformatics infrastructure and established collaborations between Yale University, University of Wisconsin,
and Massachusetts General Hospital, to create the scale and quality of data needed to address three specific
aims: SA1: Develop and prospectively validate an automated in-hospital seizure-forecasting model for use in
acute brain injury, based on our previously developed 2HELPS2B score—termed auto-2HELPS2B; SA2:
Prospectively validate the BEACON model for the impact of prolonged epileptiform activity on functional and
clinical outcomes in critical illness at discharge, 3 months, 6 months, 1-year, and 2-years, and estimate the
optimal anti-seizure drug administration strategy (indications and intensity of drugs) to mitigate detrimental
effects of EA on functional and clinical outcomes; SA3: Prospectively validate EAs as a biomarker of 1- and 2-
year epilepsy risk after acute brain injury, evaluate effects of anti-seizure drugs on acute phase EAs and
subsequent development of epilepsy, and combine EEG with radiographic and clinical information to further
improve our current epilepsy forecasting risk model.
Upon completing these aims, we will have 1. A large and representative database of high-quality EEG and
clinical data on brain-injured patients with 2-year of outcomes data. 2. Validated EEG tools to guide care in
determining acute seizure risk, prognosis for neurological recovery, and the likelihood of developing epilepsy."
10918056,"The discovery of safe and effective analgesics is an urgent societal need and a centerpiece of NIH’s HEAL initiative. Here, we test the hypothesis that the enzyme N-Acylethanolamine Acid Amidase (NAAA) offers a novel target for analgesic medications devoid of abuse potential. NAAA hydrolyzes palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a lipid messenger that suppresses nociception by engaging the nuclear receptor PPAR-α. The substantial antinociceptive properties of NAAA inhibitors have been recently recognized by a meta-analysis of the preclinical literature conducted by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), but the cellular substrates underlying such properties are still unknown. We found that Naaa-knock out (ko) mice (i) have markedly reduced nocifensive responses to formalin, compared to wild-type littermates; and (ii) fail to develop persistent sensory abnormalities in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. Conversely, Naaa- overexpressing and Ppara-ko mice exhibit robust nocifensive behavior even when given a subthreshold formalin dose. The reduced sensitivity of Naaa-ko mice to pain does not result from developmental compensation, because it can be phenocopied by administration of the NAAA inhibitor ARN19702. Importantly, ARN19702 does not exert positive motivational effects in the mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) test, which is suggestive of a lack of rewarding properties. These data point to NAAA as a promising target for the discovery of non-addictive analgesics. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims: Aim 1. Validate NAAA as a molecular target for analgesic drug discovery. Three questions will be addressed: (1) What cell types are directly targeted by NAAA inhibitors? We will generate cell-specific NAAA-ko mouse lines and evaluate, in the formalin and CCI models, pain-related behaviors and sensitivity to NAAA blockade. In parallel, we will determine the impact of pathological pain on NAAA-regulated signaling in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord (SC) of wild-type mice. (2) What cell types mediate NAAA-regulated antinociceptive signaling? We will identify PPAR-α-expressing cells involved in NAAA-dependent signaling by creating cell-specific PPAR-α-ko mouse lines and evaluating their pain-related responses and their sensitivity to NAAA inhibitors in the formalin and CCI tests. (3) Is the pharmacodynamic profile of NAAA inhibitors compatible with safe and effective use in pain therapy? We will determine whether ARN19702 (i) alleviates spontaneous nociception, (ii) produces tolerance after repeated administration, and (iii) exhibits rewarding and/or addicting potential. Aim 2. Develop improved NAAA inhibitors and examine their efficacy as analgesic agents. Better NAAA inhibitors are needed to assess NAAA’s possible role in pain therapy. We will combine computational structure-based drug and structure-activity relationship studies to discover novel agents with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, robust analgesic activity, and no addictive potential."

The overall goal of this project is to collect pilot feasibility and early efficacy data showing improvements
in cognition and wellbeing in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through a combination
treatment of non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)) and a
novel form of closed-loop digital meditation (Meditrain). MCI is a transitional stage between normal
aging and dementia, and patients with MCI are at high risk of progressing onto Alzheimer’s disease
and other dementias. Non-invasive brain stimulation and focused-attention meditation are two
approaches that hold great promise for boosting cognitive abilities and enhancing wellbeing in OA at
risk of Alzheimer’s disease. While a handful of studies have combined neural stimulation with meditation
in healthy young adults, none have employed digital closed loop meditation nor examined this question
in a population at high risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the goal of this proposed research is to collect
pilot data to test the hypothesis that coupling MediTrain with frequency-specific (i.e., theta) tACS
targeting frontal attention networks will lead to faster and/or greater magnitude of gains in cognitive
abilities, real-world indices of stress and sleep, and key blood biomarkers of aging in aMCI patients. To
accomplish these aims, we will conduction an RCT on 90 OA with aMCI who will be assigned to one of
three intervention groups: MediTrain + 6Hz tACS (n = 30), MediTrain + sham tACS (n = 30), or a
placebo (Worder app + sham tACS) intervention (n = 30). Theta (6Hz) or sham (i.e., none) stimulation
will be applied to the forehead using Humm patches during 30min of training in participants’ homes, 4
days per week, for 4 weeks. Outcome measures will consist of cognitive/attention tasks, physiological
indices of sleep and stress (both in lab and at home via wearable sensors), and blood biomarkers of
aging (telomere length). This research will provide an important contribution toward understanding the
combination of tACS and meditation as a therapeutic tool for bolstering cognitive reserve and increasing
overall wellbeing in patients with MCI."

Molecularly diverse gliomas may leverage convergent metabolic survival pathways that can be therapeutically targetable. Microdialysis enables sampling of the extracellular microenvironment and represents a previously underutilized opportunity to characterize and pharmacodynamically monitor living human gliomas, in situ. Our preliminary data from intraoperatively acquired glioma microdialysate reveal strong enrichment for methionine-associated pathways of cancer resiliency, including polyamine synthesis. Specifically, results to date have identified guanidinoacetate (GAA) as the most highly upregulated metabolite in glioma microdialysate, which we hypothesize results from upregulated polyamine synthesis within the tumor. This study will determine the reproducibility and potential therapeutic implications of our findings across a larger cohort of gliomas, asking if microdialysis could be leveraged to obtain mechanistic feedback during early phase clinical evaluation of candidate therapies. To interrogate methionine metabolism human gliomas in situ, we will perform intra-operative microdialysis and methionine tracing, comparing the metabolome of microdialysate and tissue from tumor and adjacent brain. Resected tissue will be used to determine the cellular source of methionine-associated metabolites. Recent studies have demonstrated that diverse tumors can escape DMFO-mediated polyamine metabolism by upregulation of polyamine transporters. Dual blockade of polyamine synthesis and polyamine transports with  DMFO+AMXT 1501 has been shown to improve outcomes in preclinical models. To mechanistically interrogate polyamine metabolism we will perform a combination of preclinical and clinical studies leveraging microdialysis. In a phase 0 study, patients will be randomized to vehicle, DMFO, or DMFO+AMXT 1501, prior to dual administration of DMFO+AMXT to determine the extracellular pharmacodynamic changes induced by early therapeutic stress. Collectively, these studies will test how microdialysis can be used to perform biochemical reconnaissance within the live human glioma, with and without therapeutic challenge, to gain “glioma intelligence from behind enemy lines.”"

Filoviruses are important emerging and biodefense pathogens with potential to impact global health. The
overarching goal of this renewal Program Project Grant (PPG) application is to characterize host-viral
interactions that contribute to filoviral infection, identify molecular interactions, and develop insights into
molecular mechanisms. This interdisciplinary project will provide insight into host interactions that drive filoviral
infections and identify new therapeutic targets. This multi-investigator collaborative effort will be conducted at
several sites and the Administrative Core (Core A) will provide administrative oversight and coordinate
interactions among sites to ensure that progress of this integrated research program will be maximized. Core
A will: 1. Coordinate communication by virtual meetings and teleconferences among the PIs of the Research
Projects and Scientific Cores, monthly web-based research-in-progress meetings, and an annual meeting
among members of all participating groups. These meetings will facilitate reagent and scientific exchange
among the different sites. 2. Coordinate annual meetings between the investigators and the External Advisory
Board (EAB) to assess scientific progress and to facilitate the distribution of critical evaluations on the
performance of the PPG. 3. Manage conflicts of interest and facilitate conflict resolution. 4. Coordinate fiscal
administration and Scientific Core usage to ensure that the research projects are well supported. 5. Facilitate
secure data sharing and access to inventory of reagents developed by Cores by implementing a cloud-based
commercial database platform. 6. Assist investigators with preparation and submission of annual progress
reports to the NIH and maintain a website for data dissemination. 7. Identify opportunities for training and
professional development for trainees within the PPG group and facilitate their participation and promote cross
training and expertise sharing. Through these collective actions, Core A will promote scientific interactions and
provide support for seamless functioning of the overall scientific mission to discover and characterize key host-
viral interactions that are critical for filoviral infections."
10904616,"Core B - Project Summary/Abstract
Filoviruses, which are NIAID category A priority pathogens, can subvert host immune systems to facilitate viral
replication, resulting in human case fatality rates as high as 90%. The filoviral genome encodes for seven to nine
proteins. Despite the small number of genes, limited information is available on the specific mechanisms by
which different viral-viral and viral-host interactions contribute to filoviral replication and pathogenesis, hindering
the development of antivirals or vaccines. The Antibody and Reagent Development Core (Core B) will provide
critical reagents and support for the overall scientific mission and facilitate the characterization of these
interactions. Specifically, Core B will provide a unique set of standardized antibodies, cell-lines, and mouse
models that will be disseminated amongst the Research Projects (RPs) and Cores of the PPG. In consultation
with the Administrative Core (Core A) and the PPG leadership, Core B will prioritize experiments to ensure that
reagents will be readily available to the RPs and Cores for use, validation, and characterization of interfaces
between viral proteins and host factors that impact steps in the filoviral replication cycle. Core B will develop
mouse monoclonal and synthetic antibodies against Ebola and Marburg viral proteins, generate knockout cell
lines of host factors, and generate conditional knockout mouse models of select host factors identified by RP01,
RP02, RP03, and Core C when such reagents are not commercially available. Given the need for a unified
reagent development pipeline, the scientific core activity for Core B is justified."
10904617,"Core C – Project Summary/Abstract
Core C provides support for high biocontainment work to Research Projects 1 (RP01), RP02, RP03 and Core
B. Work is prioritized through Core A. Core personnel bring unique expertise in molecular biology, cell biology
and animal disease modeling for Ebola and Marburg viruses. The core maintains virus stocks, makes
recombinant viruses, provides cell lysates and RNA from infected cells and ensures they are free of infectious
material, evaluates effects of host factor loss or overexpression on infection and performs work with transgenic
rodents. These core activities provide needed protein material and an understanding of subcellular structures
made after virus infection for RP01, are required for evaluation of virus protein function and genome stem loop
structures in controlling transcription for RP02, and provide detailed analysis of infection kinetics and host-virus
co-association for RP03. To directly address impact of host factors on virus protein production, virus RNA
transcription and the substructures formed by each, we have developed a novel protein-antibody + vRNA-FISH
based staining technique that is quantitatively assessed by automated microscopy image analysis. This
approach is expected to provide important information for the needs of each project and Core B. Core C also
works closely with Core B in production and evaluation of novel antibodies by providing purified virus lysates
and performing microscopy evaluation of staining of infected cells. The project distinguishes itself in providing
high-level molecular biology ability at BSL4 that will be used to produce recombinant viruses predicted to have
altered replication kinetics. Furthermore, use of transgenic animals, provided through Core B, will be used to
evaluate roles in controlling disease. In so doing, Core C provides the necessary processes to evaluate host
factor roles from cells through to disease that enables identification of potential targets for therapy development."
10904618,"RP01 Project Summary/Abstract for Biochemical and structural mechanisms at the filoviral-host
interface
The recent filoviral outbreaks, including the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa that
introduced the virus to other continents, highlight the imminent threat to global health posed by filoviruses and
the urgent need for basic and translational efforts. The current COVID-19 pandemic further illustrates the
significance of understanding infectious diseases. While recent efforts to develop countermeasures have
resulted in vaccine candidates and some therapeutics, filoviruses remain a considerable threat to human
health and key questions are still outstanding. There are substantial gaps in our understanding of host-viral
interactions that contribute to disease, including how viral proteins limit host responses and assemble into
infectious particles. Work in Research Project 1 (RP01) will use proteomic, biochemical, and structural
methods to identify and validate molecular mechanisms at the host-viral interface in cellular networks to
address this gap. We will address these longstanding mechanistic questions using biochemical and hybrid
structural methods, including mass spectrometry, NMR, X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS), and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), cryoelectron tomography (cryo-TM) to characterize filoviral
nucleocapsid (NC) interactions and to define high impact filoviral-host factor interactions modulating PTMs that
impact the viral replication cycle, viral NC assembly, and egress. Our strong publication record, preliminary
results from ongoing studies, and access to unique facilities and resources support these efforts. We are
uniquely positioned due to our highly productive and collaborative team with complementary expertise and a
prior record of co-authored studies with investigators in RP02, RP03, Core B, and Core C. Our Aims are: Aim
1. Determine the structural basis and dynamics of the filoviral nucleocapsid (NC) and define NC-host
interactions; Aim 2. Develop Protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps that include post-translational modifications
(PTMs) from virally infected cells for EBOV and MARV; and Aim 3. Define the molecular mechanisms for PPIs
that contribute to filoviral infection defined by this project, RP02 and RP03. At the completion, we expect to
define filoviral interaction with host factors that contribute to filoviral infection. Our arsenal of tools from mass
spectrometry, biochemistry, and structural biology, together with work from the Research Projects and
Scientific Cores within the PPG, enable us to clearly define each contribution to filoviral infection and identify
new targets for antivirals."
10904622,"RP02 Project Summary/Abstract for Contributions of Ebola and Marburg virus VP30 and VP24 proteins
to viral RNA synthesis, assembly and egress
Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are deadly emerging viruses of the filovirus family. Major gaps
remain in our understanding as to how filoviral-filoviral and filoviral-host interactions promote replication and
severe disease. Contributing to these limitations in knowledge is the requirement to study replicating filoviruses
under biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment. To overcome the BSL4 limitation, we have produced replication
cycle modeling assays, called transcription-replication competent virus-like particle (trVLP) assays, that
recapitulate each of the major steps in the EBOV and MARV replication cycles at BSL2. These tools enable
the efficient analysis of filoviral and host proteins in the context of a replicating system. These systems also
permit the study of manipulations such as lethal mutations or elimination of key host factors that are not
compatible with replication of live virus. With these assays, we have explored the role of MARV VP30 (mVP30)
and MARV VP24 (mVP24) that exhibit distinct functional properties compared to their EBOV homologues.
EBOV VP30 is required for transcription initiation of the EBOV nucleoprotein (eNP) gene and is regulated by
host proteins with PPxPxY motifs. In contrast, mVP30 is reported to not be required for viral transcription in
minigenome assays, yet it is essential for virus growth. Why it is essential has been unclear. EBOV VP24 binds
importin alpha proteins to block interferon signaling and also participates in the maturation of nucleocapsid
formation, modulates viral RNA synthesis, and is critical for filoviral infectivity. In contrast, mVP24 interacts with
host protein Keap1, a regulator of cellular antioxidant responses. Our MARV trVLP data suggests that mVP30
is essential for efficient production of viable virus, due to its requirement for transcription of the mGP gene, and
that mutations disrupting mVP24-Keap1 interaction substantially decrease infectivity. Given these findings, we
will test the hypothesis that mVP30 plays a critical role in mGP transcription initiation; we will characterize
secondary structures that we hypothesize confer mVP30 dependence on the mGP gene; and we will evaluate
how interacting host proteins modulate mVP30 function. We will also test the hypothesis that mVP24
interaction with Keap1 is required for viral growth and define specific replication steps for which mVP24-Keap1
interaction is required. Finally, with our trVLP assays, we will define the mechanisms by which other filovirus-
host interactions identified in Research Projects 1 and 3 affect virus growth. Together, these studies will
substantially enhance the understanding of interactions that play key roles in filovirus replication and
pathogenesis."

The knowledge gaps this application addresses are how precancerous lesions (i.e. metaplasia) arise and
subsequently fuel adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and
autoimmune gastritis both cause chronic inflammation and increase the risk of gastric cancer. This application
includes numerous mouse models and human tissue samples to investigate the importance of immune cells
(mast cells and Th2 T cells) and cytokines (IL4 and IL13) in inducing gastric metaplasia and promoting the
development of gastric metaplasia and tumorigenesis. Identifying inflammatory cells and signals that initiate
metaplasia and drive tumor development could improve the ability to identify individuals at an increased risk of
disease progression, and new immune based strategies to prevent and treat preneoplastic lesions associated
with gastric diseases, including gastric cancer."

 The cellular makeup of tumors can radically influence response to treatment, and
survival outcomes. Biomarkers derived from tumor biopsies have had modest success in
their clinical utility for prognosis or guiding treatment decisions, being confounded by
factors such as cellular composition of tissues Moreover, different biomarkers may be
needed in female vs male patients. In prior work we showed how meta-analysis of large
clinically annotated public cancer datasets with clinical annotations can robustly identify
specific genes and processes associated with survival for patients in both pan-cancer and
cancer-specific ways. Here we still systematically investigate cancer-specific prognostic
cell types through integration of single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) with bulk RNA-seq and
methylation data. We will validate selected findings in tissue microarrays.
 First, we will identify cancer-specific cell transcriptional states and ecosystems
associated with survival and treatment response, extending prior work that identified 10
different “ecotypes” of co-occurring cell states across carcinomas. Second, we will extend
our framework to isolate cancer-specific cell-type-specific methylation profiles and their
correlation with imputed gene expression across populations using paired bulk RNA-seq
and methylation from TCGA. Third, we will validate survival associations of cancer-
specific cell states by staining human tissue microarrays. We will focus on high grade
serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), which has dire prognosis, and non small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) for which we have extensive information on immunotherapy response.
We will use CODEX imaging on large tissue sections to assess the spatial organization
of outcome-related cell states in NSCLC and HGSOC. Overall, we will comprehensively
map cancer-specific cell states and ecotypes across malignancies, identifying potential
biomarkers and possible new therapeutic targets."
10918042,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) exacts a major personal, economical, and societal toll. Given its high lifetime
prevalence, there is an urgent need to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying AUD pathophysiology
to develop effective therapeutic strategies. Dysfunction of stress-related neuroendocrine and autonomic arousal
pathways are highly associated with alcohol-related behaviors. Repeated alcohol use increases arousal.
Moreover, higher arousal levels in treatment-seeking AUD patients correlates with higher rates of relapse. These
findings suggest reciprocal interactions between arousal and alcohol use, such that higher basal arousal
promotes alcohol drinking, which further exacerbates arousal. A challenge in understanding the neurobiological
mechanisms mediating interactions between arousal and drinking is the lack of preclinical animal models that
allow quantification of drinking together with longitudinal measurements of arousal and neuronal activity. We
addressed this by designing a voluntary ethanol consumption paradigm for head-fixed mice combined with two-
photon calcium imaging for neuronal activity recordings and pupillometry for measuring arousal. Our preliminary
experiments show that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) subdivision of the prefrontal cortex potently increases
arousal. Basal levels of arousal and arousal-related ACC activity are correlated with the amount of ethanol
consumption, suggesting that the ACC contributes to arousal modulation of drinking. Cortical activity is critically
shaped by inhibition from local interneurons. The vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) expressing interneurons
are particularly important as they inhibit other interneurons, leading to disinhibitory excitation of the ACC. We
hypothesize that ACC VIP neurons are a key node for reciprocal interactions between arousal and ethanol
consumption. In Aims 1 and 2, we test the hypothesis that VIP neuron-mediated disinhibition increases arousal
and ethanol consumption. In Aim 3, we will determine if repeated ethanol consumption increases VIP-mediated
disinhibition, leading to hyperarousal that further promotes drinking. We will test these hypotheses using a
combination of advanced approaches including multicolor two-photon calcium imaging, multicolor optogenetics,
machine vision-assisted closed-loop optogenetics, and ex-vivo slice electrophysiology. Together, these
mechanistic studies will determine how VIP neurons both contribute to and are affected by drinking, establishing
them as a key therapeutic target for modulating drinking driven by aberrant arousal."

Among patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of their mortality.
Reducing CVD risk is a critical clinical goal for treating diabetic patients. Diabetes exacerbates atherosclerosis
development and progression, which is the major cause of many CVD, including heart attacks, strokes, and
peripheral vascular disease. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis
of atherosclerosis throughout all the stages. The genetic relationship between diabetes and CVD provides the
promise for the prevention and treatment of both disorders. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that the
specific variants at the coiled-coil domain containing 92 (CCDC92) locus are associated with both type 2
diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD). The biological function and detailed mechanisms by which
CCDC92 regulates these diseases, a necessary step towards the ultimate goal of targeting CCDC92, remain
unclear. Our preliminary data demonstrated that Ccdc92 knockout inhibits high-fat diet-induced insulin
resistance and atherosclerosis in mice. We further present extensive preliminary studies showing that CCDC92
induces proatherogenic phenotypes, contributing to atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Here we hypothesize that
VSMC CCDC92 promotes atherosclerosis development and progression by regulating the lysosomal pathway.
By taking advantage of our unique animal models combined with molecular, cellular, histological approaches,
we will define the role of CCDC92 in proatherogenic phenotypes in VSMCs in vitro (Aim 1); Determine the role
of CCDC92 in atherosclerosis under diabetic and euglycemic conditions in vivo (Aim 2). Successful completion
of the proposed study would provide a deep understanding of how CCDC92 elicits atherosclerosis and will
likely set a profound foundation to define CCDC92 as a novel therapeutic target to treat atherosclerosis and
diabetes-associated CVD."

Molecular testing and targeted therapies have revolutionized cancer care resulting in better outcomes for
patients. The number of biomarker-selective clinical trials continues to increase presenting challenges for
cancer centers to adapt processes for efficient identification and enrollment of patients to these clinical trials.
Furthermore, there is a gap in uptake of molecular testing and clinical trial enrollment for minority and
underserved populations. Addressing these challenges plays an important role in ensuring equitable and
effective care for all patients. The Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center is an NCI-
designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and one of eight with lead roles in both the NCI Experimental
Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) and NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Biomarker-
selective studies are a major focus of these two networks. In this R50 Project, Dr. Gaillard will focus on
addressing challenges in patient enrollment to biomarker-selective trials. The work will focus on three
approaches: (i) development of a molecular registry to improve process of patient identification and
determination of patient eligibility at the Center level, (ii) facilitate timely referrals to biomarker-selective trials
using an electronic medical record clinical trials alert for eligible patients at the Physician level, and (iii) provide
study-eligible patients with timely education on the role of biomarkers in treatment decision making (Patient
level). The long term goal of this program is to develop a streamlined conduit for identifying, referring and
enrolling patients for personalized medicine trials. Successful development will enhance accrual to NCI-
sponsored clinical trials and be translatable to other cancer centers."
10783050,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) is the 2nd leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide with ~1.5 million deaths in
2020. A hallmark of pulmonary TB is the propensity to form cavitary lesions in ~30-85% of patients. Cavities
provide an ideal environment for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replication, are associated with decreased
penetration of antibiotics, and can lead to irreversible lung damage. Importantly, they are associated with poor
clinical outcomes including acquired drug resistance and treatment failure. Cavities develop from progression
of necrotic lung granulomas; however, mechanisms underlying their formation are not clear. Improved
understanding of the inflammatory responses that drive tissue necrosis and the ability of antibiotics to achieve
therapeutic concentrations within necrotic granulomas are needed to 1) identify targets for host directed
therapies (HDT) that can limit tissue damage and 2) to optimize antibiotic regimens. Utilizing innovative
methods in imaging and spatial multiomics, we will map the distribution of transcriptional pathways and
biomediators associated with human necrotic granulomas and cavities and of newly implemented anti-TB
drugs in such lesions with an overall goal of providing critical new data to improve TB treatment
The long term objective of this research is to provide data to guide development of a tandem therapeutic
approach of optimizing anti-TB drug regimens based on their ability to reach bactericidal concentrations in all
lesion areas combined with host-targeted therapies to limit pathologic inflammation. The specific aims of this
proposal are to (1) identify the host metabolic and lipid phenotypes associated with each tissue region of
human necrotic lung granulomas; (2) utilize spatial transcriptomics and targeted imaging to identify
pathological programs associated with tissue necrosis in necrotic granulomas; and (3) utilize target site
pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK modeling to enhance understanding of newly implemented anti-TB drugs. The
aims of this project will be achieved by enrolling a unique cohort of patients with pulmonary TB undergoing
adjunctive surgery and subsequent study of their resected lung lesions. Scientific methods employed to carry
out our aims include the use of enhanced MALDI-2 mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), laser capture
microdissection (LCM) to isolate targeted granulomas regions for high-resolution metabolomics, lipidomics and
drug concentration assays, and novel spatial transcriptomics and advanced data analytic methods to integrate
spatially resolved multi-omics data sets and model target site PK data.
This proposal will directly address key priories in the TB research agenda including attaining a better
understanding of the determinants of M. tuberculosis control in granulomas and how anti-TB drugs localize and
penetrate into granulomas and cavities. Specific goals of the proposed work are to identify host inflammatory
pathways that can be exploited for host-directed therapy and to define tissue penetrating properties of key
drugs used for drug-resistant TB to optimize drug regimen design for clinical trial testing and treatment."
10953675,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROTEOMICS AND METABOLOMICS SHARED RESOURCE
The primary goal of the Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource (PMSR) is to provide comprehensive
proteomics and metabolomics services to Cancer Center members as well as other regional NCI-designated
Cancer Centers (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University Cancer Center), and secondarily to
investigators in other academic institutions. Prior to December 2017, major mass spectrometry (MS)
instruments in the PMSR included a Thermo Q Exactive HF, a Thermo Q Exactive Plus, and a Sciex QTRAP
5500 hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. These instruments have nano-UHPLCs (ultra-high pressure
liquid chromatography) with cooled-autosamplers on the front end for proteomic analyses. A conventional flow
UHPLC is used for metabolite analyses. These LC-MS systems represent some of the highest performing,
most sensitive instruments currently available. The PMSR will continue to offer routine proteomic services such
as LC-MS/MS protein identifications from gel bands or pull-down assays, and intact protein analysis by
electrospray ionization. Over the last budget cycle, the PMSR has increasingly engaged in more challenging
proteomics problems, particularly global quantitative comparisons of proteomes or sub-proteomes using label-
free quantitation (integrated MS ion currents), quantitation using stable isotopes such as SILAC or isobaric tags
(TMT or iTRAQ), and in-depth global analysis of phosphoproteome, ubiquitomes, and acetylomes. The PMSR
will continue to improve its analytical capabilities for in-depth comprehensive analysis of global proteome and
posttranslational modifications. The PMSR has also responded to the growing need of Cancer Center
members in the field of cancer metabolism by establishing targeted relative quantitation of approximately 180
polar metabolites. To further increase its capacity in metabolomics analysis, the PMSR applied for and was
recently awarded an S10 shared instrumentation grant (S10 OD023586). This grant together with Cancer
Center funds were used to purchase a high-resolution Thermo Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer and a
Vanquish UHPLC system. This instrument was installed in December 2017 and will be dedicated to untargeted
(global) metabolomics, targeted metabolomics, untargeted lipidomics, targeted lipidomics and metabolic flux
analysis using stable isotope tracers. The PMSR also recently purchased a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer funded
by another S10 grant (S10 OD023658). This instrument can quantify mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic
activity, endogenous and exogenous fatty acid oxidation, substrate oxidation, and metabolic phenotype,
providing complementary analytical capacity to the new metabolomics LC-MS/MS system. The availability of
these new instruments will ensure that the PMSR remains state-of-the-art in providing proteomics,
metabolomics, and lipidomics services to Cancer Center members. The major emphasis of the PMSR will be to
provide expert consultation and state-of-the-art proteomics and metabolomics technologies operating at
maximum performance and affordable costs to address complex cancer biology questions."

Cushing’s syndrome occurs when the adrenal glands release too much of the stress hormone cortisol. This
endocrine disorder is naturally caused by adrenal or pituitary tumors and afflicts women five times more
frequently than men. Chronic exposure to cortisol also increases blood glucose and elevates blood pressure.
This proposal investigates the molecular pathogenesis of adrenal Cushing’s syndrome. This disease is often an
outcome of defective cAMP signaling in the adrenal cortex. Advances in precision medicine have identified point
mutations and insertions in protein kinase A catalytic subunits (PKAc) as drivers of this disease. The most
prevalent mutant is PKAc-L205R, which is found in ~45% of Cushing’s patients. Other genetic lesions include
PKAc-W196R. Both disease-causing mutations reside within a region of the kinase domain that interfaces with
its regulatory subunits. This protein-protein interface is necessary for autoinhibition of kinase activity, but also
directs the subcellular targeting of PKA holoenzymes through association with A kinase anchoring proteins
(AKAPs). Our biochemical, cell-based, and clinical analyses infer that carrying a mutant allele of PKAc-L205R
or W196R is sufficient to displace the kinase from normal subcellular sites of action in Cushing’s patients. This
has led to a working hypothesis that losing spatiotemporal control of protein kinase A underlies adrenal Cushing’s
syndrome. Aim 1 will test if i) restoration of PKA anchoring amends cortisol release, ii) identify which AKAPs
coordinate cortisol biosynthesis and iii) considers an opposing premise that “substrate rewiring” of PKAc variants
or altered enzyme stability drives Cushing’s syndrome. At first glance, the PKAc-L205R and PKAc-W196R
mutants look virtually identical. Yet we have discovered that these are physiochemically distinct kinases that
engage different cell signaling pathways. Analyses of patient tissue reveal that PKAc-L205R mobilizes the Hippo
signaling pathway to control organ size. Conversely phenotypic profiling of adrenal-specific knock-in mice indicate
that PKAc-W196R activates the ERK mitogenic kinase cascade. Aim 2 will evaluate i) if female PKAcWT/W196R
mice are more prone to Cushing’s comorbidities, ii) test if PKAc-L205R engages the Hippo signaling cascade to
drive cortisol hyperproduction and iii) ascertain if PKAc-W196R coordinates ERK signaling events to promote
adrenal hyperplasia. This proposal explores two transformative ideas that will change how we think about
Cushing’s syndrome. 1) Losing spatiotemporal control of protein kinase A underlies adrenal Cushing’s
pathologies. 2) Adjacent and identical mutations in PKAc drive adrenal hyperplasia and cortisol hypersecretion
in Cushing’s patients."

and in DCT structure with optical tissue clearing and 3-D imaging. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia are
commonly seen together clinically e.g. following cisplatin chemotherapy. Hypokalemia is often refractory to K+
supplementation unless hypomagnesemia is resolved, but the underlying mechanisms have not been
determined. Aim 2 will test two proposed mechanisms that promote K+ secretion along the connecting segment

increased Na+ delivery from DCT. We will determine NCC, ENaC, and ROMK activities in hypomagnesemic
mice and a new mouse model of hypomagnesemia/hypokalemia by performing diuretic response tests. We will
also test whether Mg2+ supplementation can mitigate K+ losses in mouse models with inducible NCC inhibition.
The apical K+ channel Kv1.1 has been proposed to generate the membrane potential that provides the drive for
Mg2+ entry along the DCT, since human Kv1.1 mutations cause hypomagnesemia. However, experimental
evidence is lacking. To test this, In Aim 3 we will phenotype a novel renal tubule-specific Kv1.1 knockout mouse,

10793513,"Optimal expression of endothelial-enriched tunica interna endothelial cell kinase (Tie2) and vascular endothelial
cadherin (VE-cad) in endothelial cells (ECs) is required to form restrictive endothelial barrier and to maintain
vascular homeostasis. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex inflammatory disease associated with increased lung
vascular permeability. Rapid reduction in the expression of Tie2 and VE-cad in ECs contributes to ALI. Studies
proposed in this application will test the central hypothesis that the calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent
kinase CaMKKβ-mediated expression of the transcription factor Elf2 promotes the resolution of inflammatory
lung injury through the expression of Tie2 and VE-cad in ECs. This project was inspired by our seminal
observations that Camkkβ deficient (Camkkβ─/─) mice are unusually susceptible to LPS-induced lung injury and
that expression of both CaMKKβ and Elf2 is downregulated in lung endothelia from septic patients. We
discovered that CaMKKβ signaling downstream of TLR4 and PAR-1 (a GPCR) mediates EC expression of Elf2,
which in turn induces EC-specific transcription of the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, and VE-cad. In Camkkβ─/─
mice, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine or expression of wild type (WT) but not kinase-defective
CaMKKβ, restored the expression of Tie2 and VE-cad. Genome-wide methylation analysis showed that the
gene encoding the transcription factor Elf2 was hyper-methylated in ECs of Camkkβ─/─ mice. Further, methyl-
CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which binds methylated-CpG and thereby represses transcription, was
associated with regulatory regions of the Elf2 gene in Camkkβ─/─ mice. Consistent with these findings, Elf2
expression was markedly reduced in ECs of Camkkβ─/─ mice. Interestingly, EC-specific deletion of either DNA
methyltransferase Dnmt3b (Dnmt3bEC─/─) or Mecp2 (Mecp2EC─/─) in mice, augmented Elf2 expression in ECs.
Importantly, in EC-specific Elf2 knockout (Elf2EC─/─) mice, expression of Tie2 and VE-cad was dramatically
reduced. Based on these novel findings, in Aim 1a, we will test the hypothesis that DNA methyl transferase
DNMT3b mediates methylation of Elf2-gene promoter in quiescent ECs and in Aim 1b, we will test the
hypothesis that the methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2, binds methylated-CpG in the promoter regions of the
Elf2 gene and inactivates Elf2 transcription. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CaMKKβ activated
downstream of TLR4 and/or PAR-1 mediates phosphorylation of MeCP2 residue S421, which in turn induces the
expression of Elf2 in ECs. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that Elf2 activation is required for the optimal
expression of Tie2 and VE-cad in ECs and thus repair of the lung endothelial barrier. We will employ
biochemical, molecular, and imaging approaches to define the underlying mechanisms. Importantly, we will use
EC-restricted knockout mouse models (Dnmt3bEC─/─, Mecp2EC─/─, CamkkβEC─/─ and Elf2EC─/─) created by us to
accomplish the goals. Our hope is that these studies will identify therapeutic targets to reverse sepsis-induced
acute lung injury based on a deeper understanding of endogenous EC repair programs."

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people age 14–24, and rates in this age group are
increasing. Most suicide risk factors are distal (i.e., long-standing, static), thus informative regarding who is at
risk, but not when. As such, our ability to reliably predict near-term suicide risk among vulnerable populations
remains grossly inadequate.
Studies consistently demonstrate a link between subjective sleep disturbances and the continuum of suicidality.
Yet, sleep is a complex behavior that can be measured along multiple dimensions and at varying levels of
analysis. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the role of normative biological and psychosocial
developmental processes that further contribute to dynamic changes in risk related to sleep disturbance. Such
changes in sleep are particularly dramatic during adolescence. Studies also have not examined how sleep
interacts with other known pathways, such as dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems,
to lead to suicidality in vulnerable youth.
We thus propose to conduct an 8-week prospective multi-method study of sleep health and suicidal thoughts
and behavior in a transdiagnostic sample of ultra-high risk adolescents (14-18) who have recently enrolled in an
Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Program. We will capitalize on the extant clinical and research
infrastructures to compare sleep-suicide associations and plausible affective, cognitive and arousal-related
mechanisms using self-report, behavioral, lab task paradigms and physiology in adolescents at ultra-high risk
for suicide."
10773186,"Project summary: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in childhood is the leading cause of pediatric emergency room
visits, with over 800,000 children visiting the ER each year according to the CDC. Pediatric TBI can have
lifelong consequences for behavioral health, increases rates of ADHD, drug and alcohol abuse, long-term
cognitive and social deficits, depression and anxiety. This suggests that early childhood is a period of particular
vulnerability to long-term, deleterious neurological outcomes after TBI. Despite the clear evidence of a
significant public health problem, the proximal mechanisms leading up to those long term TBI-related
outcomes are poorly understood. TBI induces robust neuroinflammation and brain-resident innate immune
cells, such as microglia, regulate normal brain development, including synaptic patterning. The impact of TBI
on microglia-synaptic interactions is poorly understood. We have demonstrated dramatic developmental biases
in activation and sex differences in the profile of neuroimmune cells in the immature rat brain, both microglia
and the less studied mast cells. Mast cells are abundant in the developing brain and sparse in adults,
suggesting that mast cells could contribute uniquely to the neuroimmune milieu after pediatric TBI. Mast cells
are ‘first responders’ to immune insults and coordinate subsequent immune cell (microglia and astrocyte)
activation as well as vascular permeability but their role in TBI has not been well studied. In our project, we will
use lateral fluid percussion injury on juvenile rats to model pediatric TBI, which our preliminary data suggest
elicits robust mast cell activation in the hippocampus, acute gliosis, and long-term, sex-dependent shifts in
social behavior and stress hormones. Because so little is known about the unique pediatric response to injury,
we will compare the pediatric versus adult injury response of male and female rats via RNAseq and Nanostring
profiling of isolated immune cells in a comprehensive time course study (Aim 1). To test for a contribution of
mast cells to pediatric TBI, we will use an acute mast cell inhibition using an FDA-approved pharmacological
agent and comprehensively profile neuroinflammatory responses, alterations in blood brain barrier (BBB)
permeability to narrow in on a potential mechanism through which mast cells are acting after TBI, and correlate
BBB changes with social and stress-related behavior outcomes (Aim 2). To determine whether microglia are
important for long-term neurodevelopmental programming of behavioral outcomes and sculpting neural circuits
after pediatric TBI, we will perform microglia depletion/forced turnover experiments post-TBI (Aim 3). We will
compare sexes in all studies, and we predict that males more robust basal neuroimmune tone in the
developing brain may render them more vulnerable to TBI-related outcomes. Our studies have the potential to
improving long-term outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury and uncover potential new therapeutic
options targeted to the unique neuroimmune environment of the developing brain."

10816989,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Food insecurity is paradoxically associated with elevated risk of adolescent obesity in the United States. The
mechanisms underlying this excess risk are not well understood, and such knowledge is essential for informing
obesity prevention efforts for adolescents from under-resourced backgrounds. Thus, aligned with the need
emphasized by the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research to identify the reasons contributing to increased risk
for obesity among economically marginalized populations, research is critically needed to elucidate modifiable
mechanisms to target in obesity prevention efforts among food-insecure adolescents. In the proposed project,
Dr. Hazzard, a registered dietitian and public health researcher, will examine binge eating as a potential
mechanism to explain the association between food insecurity and elevated risk for adolescent obesity. With the
exceptional mentorship team she has assembled and the resources available to her through the University of
Minnesota, this Pathway to Independence Award will support Dr. Hazzard in filling critical training gaps and
conducting the research necessary to launch her career as an independent investigator conducting intervention
work to promote food security and healthy weight among adolescents experiencing food insecurity. To prepare
her for this role, a multifaceted training plan including coursework, mentorship, and research is proposed in: (1)
qualitative and mixed methods, (2) advanced statistical methods, with a focus on machine learning and causal
mediation analysis, and (3) intervention design, development, and dissemination, with an emphasis on human-
centered design. The expertise Dr. Hazzard develops through this training plan will be essential for conducting
the proposed research. During the mentored K99 phase, she will elucidate the etiology of binge eating in the
context of food insecurity during adolescence using a mixed-methods approach that involves (a) conducting
qualitative interviews in food-insecure adolescents who report binge eating and (b) leveraging existing data from
an NIH-funded observational cohort to employ tree-based machine learning techniques (Aim 1). In the
independent R00 phase, Dr. Hazzard will recruit 175 adolescents into a new, independent cohort that she will
follow for 18 months to quantify the extent to which binge eating mediates the longitudinal association between
food insecurity and weight gain during adolescence (Aim 2). Finally, using a human-centered design approach,
she will develop vignettes describing potential school-based interventions to improve food security and prevent
excess weight gain among food-insecure adolescents and assess perceived acceptability of the potential
interventions using these vignettes in semi-structured interviews with adolescents who have experienced food
insecurity (Aim 3). Findings from this project will lay the groundwork for the development and implementation of
a school-based intervention to promote food security and healthy weight among adolescents experiencing food
insecurity and, in turn, promote Dr. Hazzard’s successful transition to an independent research career.

10823317,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to enhance the capabilities of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(dMRI)for neonatal and pediatric subjects. Currently, dMRI is the only viable non-invasive method for probing
brain microstructure. The past two decades have witnessed development of more powerful and more complex
modelsof brain microstructure based on dMRI signal. Unfortunately, accurate and reliable estimation of these
models require large numbers of high-quality measurements, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain in
neonatal and pediatric subjects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for methods that can accurately and
robustly estimatethe micro-structural biomarkers from reduced and low-quality measurements. To address this
need, this researchwill develop and validate data-driven and machine learning (ML) techniques methods for
estimating dMRI biomarkers for neonatal and pediatric subjects. The potential of these methods has greatly
increased by the availability of large high-quality dMRI datasets such as the Human Connectome Project
(HCP) data. Recent works, including our own studies, have demonstrated that ML techniques have a great
potential to overcome limitations of the existing analysis tools and to achieve superior estimation accuracy.
This research will substantially extend our preliminary work and generate important new capabilities that
currently do not exist. Specifically, we will develop and validate novel methods for estimating important micro-
structural models and biomarkers, ranging from diffusion tensor to advanced multi-compartment models, with
far fewer measurements.In this regard, the two main novel aspects of our work will include 1) the use of spatio-
temporal atlases to improvethe accuracy of subject-level analysis and 2) development of new deep neural
network architectures based on self-attention. Furthermore, we will develop new techniques for enhancing the
reliability, robustness, and explainability of ML methods for dMRI analysis. This will include techniques for
computing well-calibrated uncertainty estimations, techniques that can detect corrupt, noisy, and out-of-
distribution measurements, and techniques that enable interpretation and explanation of the predictions of
these ML methods. We will evaluate the new methods using test-retest and bootstrapping methods and via
assessment by experts in brain anatomyand micro-structure. The methods developed in this research will
enable quantitative assessment of neonatal and pediatric brain micro-structure and the impact of
developmental factors and neurological disorders at thesecritical stages in brain development with accuracy,
detail, and reproducibility that is currently beyond reach."
10754974,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a leading cause of morbidity in premature infants. PHH is triggered
by germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that results in accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in
the brain compression of surrounding brain tissue, and permanent neurological deficits. While PHH is clearly
caused by an altered balance of CSF production and removal, the mechanisms are poorly understood, limiting
our ability to guide rational therapies. Here, we propose to examine two processes that could be manipulated
therapeutically to alleviate PHH: (1) ion and fluid transport by the choroid plexus (ChP), and (2) ventricular blood
clearance by macrophages. In adults under normal physiological conditions, sheets of specialized ChP epithelial
cells secrete CSF via an incompletely understood set of membrane proteins including NKCC1, a phosphorylation
activated bi-directional Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Strikingly, we recently discovered that NKCC1 participates in CSF
removal rather than CSF secretion during early stages of brain development. CSF-K+ levels are significantly
higher in embryos than adults, likely explaining this opposite direction of NKCC1 water transport8. Experimental
introduction of blood into the ventricles during development appears to further elevate CSF-K levels, and to drive
intracellular calcium activity in ChP epithelial cells, expression of the immediate early gene c-fos, and increased
expression/phosphorylation of NKCC1. Our findings suggest a novel counter-regulatory response to IVH in
premature infants: ChP absorption of CSF via NKCC1, driven by K+. We will test this hypothesis by determining
if NKCC1 activation either worsens or mitigates hydrocephalus in our mouse IVH model (Aim 1; preliminary data
suggests the latter). We also found that following IVH, blood products linger in the developing ventricles and may
account for the persistence of PHH. The brain's ventricles and the apical surface of the ChP are home to specific
macrophages known as Kolmer cells. While Kolmer cells have been implicated as responders to brain
hemorrhage, their scavenging and other functions have remained elusive. Our data suggest that during early
stages of brain development, ventricular macrophages/Kolmer cells are activated and recruited to the site of
blood leakage within the ventricle (Aim 2A) and that these macrophages are necessary and sufficient to clear
blood and/or inflammatory signals from the ventricles (Aim 2B, C). Collectively, our data suggest that the ultimate
severity of PHH depends on a developmental stage-specific interplay between blood products, ion
concentrations (e.g. [K]), immune and inflammatory reactions, and NKCC1 expression levels. An estimated 20%
of infants that experience intraventricular bleeds develop PHH. We suspect this is due to insufficient endogenous
compensatory responses. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve outcomes by laying the groundwork
for development of clinical treatments that boost endogenous removal of CSF and blood that drive the pathogenic
processes that lead to PHH. This proposal should also guide therapies for adult IVH and other conditions with
disrupted extracellular ionic homeostasis."

Although IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) cells are a major pathogenic contributor to autoimmune diseases,
functional diversity undermines their potential as a prospective target for treating autoimmunity. Th17 cells are
currently classified into homeostatic and inflammatory subpopulations. It was noted that inflammatory Th17 cells
can be beneficial (anti-infection) and pathogenic (pro-autoimmunity). The distinction between homeostatic and
inflammatory Th17 cells has been extensively studied. However, how to dissect the anti-infection and pro-
autoimmunity functions of inflammatory Th17 cells is largely unknown. There is a critical need for this knowledge
given serious infections and fatal outcomes observed in patients receiving general inhibitors of inflammatory
Th17 cells (e.g. antibodies against IL-23). Herein, autoimmune and anti-infection subsets of inflammatory Th17
cells are for the first time distinguished experimentally. The objective of this grant is to elucidate the metabolic
regulation discriminating autoimmune and anti-infection Th17 cells derived from murine models and human
patients. The central hypothesis is that autoimmune and anti-infection Th17 subsets adopt distinct serine
metabolic programming. The rationale is that determining the differences between autoimmune and anti-infection
Th17 subsets will offer opportunities for novel therapeutics with substantially improved selectivity than the current
regimens. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to determine the mechanism
for regulating serine metabolism in the autoimmune Th17 subset; 2) to determine the mechanism by which serine
regulates pathogenicity of the autoimmune Th17 subset; and 3) to determine the transcriptional and metabolic
programming of Th17 cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Under the first aim, autoimmune
Th17 cells recovered from murine models will be used to measure intracellular serine and indicators of
autoimmune pathogenicity with modulation of serine metabolic enzymes. For the second aim, biochemical
approaches and murine models will be employed to evaluate the relationship between serine-induced
intracellular methylation and pathogenic potential of Th17 cells. In the third aim, RNA-seq analysis will be
performed to evaluate transcription profiles of Th17 cells from IBD patients. The research proposed in this
application is innovative, because it focuses on the immunometabolic regulation discriminating anti-infection
and autoimmune Th17 subsets, a heretofore-unexamined mechanism. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to provide novel opportunities to develop autoimmune Th17-selective therapeutics for
autoimmune diseases. This would be extraordinarily important for patients that have been infected or exposed
to certain pathogens, such as tuberculosis, since existing Th17 inhibitors cannot be used due to the risks of
decreasing the patients’ control of the infection."

In the United States, nearly 10% of the population (more than 30 million) has type 2 diabetes (T2D) and this number is growing not only in older adults but also in children, teens, and young adults. The alarming and continued increase of T2D incidence, especially among young Americans, creates an urgent need for new therapeutics and interventions. One of the underlying conditions leading to T2D is the dysfunction of beta cells. While discovering the molecular changes in beta cells leading to their dysfunction has been a focused effort in the field, less is known about how the microenvironment, such as secreted factors from exocrine pancreas, may also contribute to pathogenesis. Trefoil factor family peptides (TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3) are unique secreted proteins in that they contain six cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bridges, which makes them more stable and resistant to proteases and other harsh conditions. Trefoil factors have been shown to play essential roles in maintaining the integrity of gut and lung epithelium, and in repairing epithelial cells after injury. Trefoil factors are expressed in the pancreas, but their roles are not well understood. We have preliminary data revealing that Tff2 is expressed by the exocrine pancreas and the knockout of this gene in the pancreas leads to beta cell dysfunction in adult mice. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Tff2 exerts on beta cells are unknown. Our central hypothesis is that Tff2 protects against the damaging effects of diabetogenic stress. We will use our pancreas-specific knockout mouse model of Tff2 and primary human tissues/cells for our studies. In Aim 1, we will examine how the lack of Tff2 in the murine pancreas affects beta cell dysfunction in aged mice and under diabetogenic conditions. In Aim 2, we will clarify the distribution patterns of trefoil factor family proteins and their receptors in human pancreatic tissues and study the crosstalk between exocrine and islet cells via TFF2 by using in vitro model systems. We will use innovative tools to test novel hypotheses on the actions about trefoil factors within a translation-focused institutional environment at City of Hope. This work will positively impact diabetes research by addressing a promising candidate secretory factor for diabetes prevention/treatment."
10904623,"RP03 Project Summary/Abstract
Filoviruses critically depend on cellular proteins to facilitate replication and are susceptible to inhibition by cellular
antiviral systems. Research Project 3 (RP03) tests the roles of host protein complexes in virus replication and
establishes an approach to evaluate large datasets for biological importance in virus infection. The work builds
on our genome-wide siRNA, CRISPR-Cas9, BioID, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), and co-affinity purification plus mass
spectrometry screening data that has identified 100s of host factors that play roles in EBOV and MARV
replication. Traditionally, follow up on such large hit sets has been slow, hampered by assays of sufficient
throughput and informative read-out to provide needed prioritization. Additionally, hits tend to addressed in
isolation, disregarding the relatedness of each hit by function or cellular association. Here, we apply an advanced
computer algorithm, the Prize Collecting Steiner Forest (PCSF) algorithm to associate hit proteins by known,
high confidence, published, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Overlaying virus protein interactions
detected in Y2H and proteomics work revealed clusters of host proteins that interact with a common virus protein.
Furthermore, overlaying highest probability protein function using Gene Ontology (GO) terms from different
databases, revealed clusters of host proteins related by likely cellular function, with actin regulation and RNA
processing being the most over-represented but also pathways related to protein modifications through
ubiquitinylation, sumoylation or phosphorylation being evident (as seen in RP01 and RP02). Based on these
novel findings, we propose the hypothesis that the host factors residing in subnetworks related by common virus
proteins, function or both play the same role in a specific virus replication step. Here, we test this hypothesis by
applying a novel, statistically high powered optical pooled screening platform that phenotypically evaluates
infection outcome by measuring both virus protein and virus RNA expression levels together with subcellular
staining patterns to associate viral functional relatedness to relatedness by known host PPI. This approach
allows efficient prioritization of groups of factors for evaluation by mechanistic assays that identify affected steps
in virus infection and then defining regions of the host and virus proteins responsible for the infection outcome.
The work starts with high priority validated leads representing the actin and RNA processing networks, then
evaluates our existing high stringency network, which is then expanded and enriched through new data fed from
RP01 and RP02. Our team consists of experts with strong track records in performing and analyzing large host
factor genetic and proteomic screens, and performing virus mechanistic analysis. Through extensive interaction
between each group, we expect to gain mechanistic insight into roles for identified host factor protein
subnetworks, which will provide knowledge-based choices for design of interventions targeting these
interactions, for both EBOV and MARV."
10767849,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Islet amyloid is a pathological characteristic of type 2 diabetes, contributing to the β-cell loss and secretory
dysfunction that characterize the disease. The unique peptide constituent of these amyloid deposits is the β-
cell secretory product islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which aggregates to form amyloid resulting in β-cell
apoptosis. Human IAPP (hIAPP) aggregation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress,
but the mechanism by which formation of islet amyloid results in mitochondrial dysfunction remains unclear.
Cholesterol accumulation in the β-cell is also associated with cellular loss and secretory dysfunction; however,
the mechanism by which cholesterol accumulation is deleterious also remains elusive.
 Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein (StAR) transports cholesterol from the outer to the inner
mitochondrial membrane for subsequent metabolism. In classical steroidogenic tissues, cholesterol
metabolism by cleavage enzymes (CYPs) results in production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex
steroids. In non-classical steroidogenic tissues, StAR is vital to the production of bile acids, glucocorticoids,
neurosteroids and oxysterols that either protect or harm the cell.
 We have established StAR to be present in β-cells and specifically upregulated under conditions of amyloid
formation. This upregulation of StAR in β-cells resulted in increased mitochondrial cholesterol, decreased
mitochondrial function and reduced cell viability. We also found that CYP27A1, which is involved in oxysterol
production, was down regulated with islet amyloid formation, while CYP11A1 and other downstream CYPs
responsible for steroid production were not present in islets. Finally, while expression of StAR is known to be
regulated acutely by the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein), we found CREB
activity to be increased chronically along with StAR under amyloid forming conditions.
 Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that islet amyloid formation induces StAR expression in a
CREB-dependent manner, resulting in increased transport of cholesterol into mitochondria that in turn leads to
mitochondrial dysfunction, β-cell dysfunction and β-cell loss.
 This hypothesis will be addressed in the following three specific aims, each of which is intended to answer
important questions.
Specific Aim 1: To determine the role of StAR in mediating the toxic effects of increased β-cell cholesterol in
vitro. This aim will answer the following questions: a) Does StAR knockdown under conditions of cholesterol
loading protect hIAPP islets from amyloid-induced toxicity? b) Does StAR overexpression impair mitochondrial
function and result in β-cell dysfunction and loss? c) Can overexpression of CYP27A1 protect islets from the
detrimental effects of StAR on mitochondrial function under amyloid-forming conditions?
Specific Aim 2: To determine whether long-term reduction of StAR expression in vivo ameliorates the
detrimental effects of islet amyloid deposition on β-cell mass and function. This aim will answer the following
question: Does selective β-cell StAR deficiency decrease β-cell loss and dysfunction under amyloid forming
conditions in vivo?
Specific Aim 3: To determine whether sustained activation of CREB and CRTC2 is required for islet amyloid-
induced upregulation of StAR. This aim will answer the following questions: a) Is CREB required for amyloid-
induced upregulation of StAR? b) Is CRTC2 necessary and/or sufficient for CREB’s action to increase StAR
expression in islets? c) Does CREB directly bind the StAR promoter under amyloid forming conditions?
 These studies will provide novel data regarding the role of StAR in amyloid-induced mitochondrial
dysfunction and β-cell toxicity, and thereby potentially identify new β-cell targets for treating type 2 diabetes."

Helicobacter pylori infection can serve as a highly relevant, rigorous and tractable model to investigate an
understudied area within the host-pathogen interactions, bacterial-driven carcinogenesis infection. Helicobacter
pylori infection is the number one risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Interestingly, while
Helicobacter pylori colonization is very common, only a small percentage of infected people will go on to develop
gastric cancer as a result of colonization. Nevertheless, this equates to a significant number of gastric cancer
patients. Current estimates provided by the American Cancer Society, are that there will be 27,600 new cases
of gastric cancer diagnosed and an estimated 11,010 deaths attributed to the disease in 2020. Differences in
how a host responds to the infection can impact the level of inflammation and chronic oxidative stress which
contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. This proposal is based on the following scientific premise: 1. The interleukin
17 signaling pathway has been implicated in driving inflammation due to its ‘pro-inflammatory’ activities;
contributing to immunopathology through signaling epithelial cells to recruit neutrophils and potentiate oxidative
stress and 2. IL-17 receptor signaling also contributes to limiting chronic inflammation within the gastric mucosa
during H. pylori infection – which directly challenges the basic understanding of the IL-17 pathway. In this
application, we propose an experimental strategy that will identify the cell-specific mechanisms by which IL-17RA
and IL-17RC regulate the adaptive immune response during H. pylori colonization. We hypothesize that H. pylori-
mediated chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis is controlled by cell-specific, TRAF-dependent IL-17
signaling. Further, that IL-17R signaling through either RA or RC is necessary for a pro-inflammatory response
in some cell types (i.e. epithelial cells) but plays an underappreciated, anti-inflammatory role in CD4+ T
lymphocyte activation. Further, we propose a strategy that will investigate how other factors in the gastric
microenvironment might impact IL-17 signaling through modulating IL-17R signaling complexes and TNF
receptor associated factors (TRAFs) which orchestrate signaling and subsequent transcription and proliferation.
Our research approach will determine if these dichotomous roles of IL-17R contribute to the host’s ability to
control H. pylori infection and inflammation without the development of gastric cancer. This project will provide
an understanding of how IL-17 receptor signaling affects the development of carcinogenesis in both a mouse
model, as well as in human specimens using an existing tissue array. These studies will help create tools which
can be leveraged for future studies to identify biomarkers of cancer progression, investigate how immune-
therapies or vaccines might affect outcomes of H. pylori colonization. Ultimately, these tools could help to
determine how supplemental immunotherapies might enhance bacterial clearance, reduce development of
antimicrobial resistance and reduce the risk of gastric cancer."
10768629,"Chronic lung or neuromuscular diseases impair gas exchange leading to chronic hypercapnia (CH). CH is
unfortunately common in the Veteran’s Affairs patient population, and is associated with poor long-term
prognoses, higher mortality rates and reduced cognitive function. While systemic physiologic adaptations may
limit the negative consequences of CH, patients with CH may be predisposed to pathological maladaptive
responses to acute-on-chronic exacerbations thereof, especially within CNS networks that control breathing.
However, very little is known about these adaptive and/or maladaptive mechanisms elicited by varying degrees
of CH. Our proposed studies are focused on testing the overall hypothesis that CH induces compensatory
shifts in gene expression within key cell populations controlling breathing and/or cognitive function, where further
exacerbation of hypercapnia cause maladaptive changes in gene expression and physiologic function.
We recently established the time-dependent physiologic adaptions to mild CH over 30 days (d) of chronic
exposure to 6% inspired CO2 (InCO2; PaCO2 ~55 mmHg) in our freely behaving adult goat model. Among others,
mild CH induced time-dependent adaptive changes in steady state ventilation, ventilatory CO2/H+ sensitivity,
heart rate, blood pressure, renal bicarbonate and potassium reclamation and metabolic rate, but impaired
cognitive function. Ventilation dramatically increased within 1-3 hours (h) but by 24h decreased to a steady-state
above normal. In contrast, the ventilatory CO2/H+ chemoreflex decreased within 1-2d but normalized by 7d.
Steady-state ventilation was greater than predicted throughout the 30d CH, indicative of a yet-to-be-identified
“missing stimulus” to breathe which we hypothesize represents a CH-induced respiratory neuroplasticity.
To gain insight into mild CH-induced neuroplasticity, we identified time-dependent shifts in select markers of
neuroplasticity within brainstem and cortical sites important in respiratory control and cognition. We found
transient changes in interleukin 1-ß (IL-1ß), glutamate receptor subunit expression/phosphorylation, and
serotonergic system markers. However, these correlative changes in markers of neuroplasticity failed to
adequately explain the mechanisms of neuroadaption during CH. Accordingly, we propose to apply bulk tissue
(bt) and/or single nuclear (sn)RNA sequencing technologies to query the molecular underpinnings of the
physiologic respiratory adaptations and cognitive decline induced by CH in goats. Our team has previously and
successfully applied these cutting-edge approaches in rats to identify differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in
brainstem regions (btRNA-Seq) or within specific cell types (snRNA-seq), and are thus poised to apply these
technologies to our goat model of CH. Preliminary physiologic studies simulating acute-on-chronic hypercapnia
(by further chronically increasing inspired CO2 from 6% to 8% to induce moderate hypercapnia) showed a
pathological depression of cardiorespiratory variables during acute and severe hypercapnia. Thus, our
published and preliminary data support our overall hypothesis, which will be further tested by applying cutting-
edge, established methodologies to fill existing gaps in knowledge regarding the fundamental neurobiological
effects of CH. We will achieve our goal through four Specific Aims: Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that 3 to 24h
of mild CH induces dynamic, adaptive shifts in gene expression/cellular signaling pathways within CNS regions
controlling cardiorespiratory and cognitive functions. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that 7d of mild CH induces
cell type-specific changes in gene expression/signaling pathways that underlie adaptive CH-induced respiratory
neuroplasticity. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that moderate CH predisposes goats to pathophysiological
responses to severe hypercapnia (acute-on-chronic exacerbation) due to maladaptive shifts in gene expression
profiles/cellular signaling pathways within CNS regions controlling cardiorespiratory and cognitive functions."

Ewing sarcoma, a cancer of the bone and soft tissue of children and young adults, remains a highly lethal cancer
despite the use of aggressive chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. The tumor is dependent on the development
of a hybrid gene that brings together parts of two different genes, EWSR1 and FLI1, through chromosomal
translocation or chromoplexy. The resulting EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein acts as a transcriptional and chromatin
regulator. Building from the work of our lab and others demonstrating that EWS-FLI1 gains neomorphic activity
to regulates chromatin state at microsatellite coopted to become enhancers in tumor cells. However, we have
shown that the activity and genomic targeting of EWS-FLI1 is influenced by the underlying epigenomic state of
the cell. We demonstrated that primary and in vitro differentiated mesenchymal stem cells offer a chromatin state
similar to that of Ewing sarcoma. We hypothesize that during stem cell differentiation a unique permissive
chromatin state develops that enables EWS-FLI1. Further, we hypothesize that this permissive state is made
up of chromatin regulators, characteristically modified histones and specific RNAs. In this project we will
employ cancer cell (Aim 1) and stem cell developmental approaches (Aim 2) to identify the protein and RNA
interactors and the posttranslational modifications of histones that create a favorable environment. We predict
that critical features will be shared between both model systems. We will test the impact of these factors by
evaluating the activity of EWS-FLI1 on chromatin states and transcription when these factors are modulated.
The generation of Ewing sarcoma patient derived stem cells will enable us to evaluate the impact of EWS-FLI1
across the process of cellular differentiation. Integrated single cell analytics of chromatin accessibility and the
transcriptome will enable direct evaluation of the impact of EWS-FLI1 on chromatin and, reciprocally, chromatin
on EWS-FLI1. We will specifically study the biochemical interaction and functional relationship between
EWS-FLI1 and the transcriptional regulator PAX7, one of the interactors identified during pilot
experimentation."
10748390,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) cause life-
threatening infections that are associated with unacceptably high mortality rates. CR-Kp is particularly
challenging to treat since it often possesses a myriad of molecular resistance determinants that enable it to grow
in the presence of most antibiotics. New β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), such as ceftazidime-
avibactam, are not a sustainable therapeutic solution for CR-Kp as monotherapy since there is potential for
development of resistance and clinical failure rates remain remarkably high when used alone. Up to 95% of CR-
Kp still remain susceptible to at least one of the aminoglycosides (AMG). However, nearly all CR-Kp isolates
harbor at least one of the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AME), which inactivate a subset of the AMGs.
Thus, selecting an AMG that is tailored to the AMEs and other AMG-resistance determinants (strain-specific
AMG) is innovative and provides the foundation for this application, which is focused on development of
molecularly precise AMG-based combinations for CR-Kp. Our central hypothesis is that novel combination
regimens including short-courses of an optimally dosed, strain-specific AMG and a BL/BLI can maximize killing
and resistance suppression of CR-Kp. Our promising preliminary data are highly supportive of our innovative
and mechanistic approach. We developed a preliminary model to predict the strain-specific AMG based on an
isolate’s AMG-resistance genes. We generated the first data for the combination of the strain-specific AMG with
a BL/BLI (ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam) against CR-Kp in both
the hollow fiber infection model (HFIM) and the mouse pneumonia model, where the combination was highly
synergistic. We have also developed a novel assay to quantify intracellular AMG concentrations. Leveraging our
latest assays, we will elucidate the mechanisms responsible for synergy of the combination between a strain-
specific AMG and BL/BLI in CR-Kp to rationally optimize them for future clinical trials. In Aim 1, the precise
influence of each AMG-resistance determinant on AMG activity will be defined and novel predictors of AMG-
resistance will be elucidated. In Aim 2, we will design novel short-course AMG treatment regimens that are
efficacious. We will define the time-course of AMG-tolerance and resistance emergence using systems
pharmacology and protein synthesis assays. In Aim 3, we will rationally optimize AMG and BL/BLI combinations
by identifying mechanisms of synergy and assessing antibiotic target site concentrations. The HFIM will be used
to define the pharmacodynamics of combinations and determine optimal timing of antibiotic administration. In
Aim 4, we will develop quantitative and systems pharmacology (QSP) models that integrate our mechanistic
data and rationally optimize AMG-based combination dosing strategies based on AMG-resistance determinants
in CR-Kp. QSP-optimized combinations will be prospectively validated in mouse pneumonia models. This project
will develop novel, molecularly precise AMG-based combinations to combat the urgent threat of CR-Kp."

 Neonatal seizures occur once per 1000 live births and are associated with subsequent development of
epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and intellectual disability. Most (85%) are acute symptomatic seizures (i.e., due to an
acute injury). Roughly one-quarter of survivors will subsequently develop epilepsy (i.e., chronic unprovoked
seizures) after a months-to-years delay. We propose to address three questions in the management of acute
symptomatic neonatal seizures. Our central hypothesis is that optimizing the clinical management of this
vulnerable population will reduce the development of epilepsy. First, what is the best second-line anti-seizure
medication (ASM) for acute neonatal seizures? Our preliminary data suggest the two most used ASMs,
levetiracetam (LEV) and phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT), have roughly equivalent effectiveness. We will conduct
in-depth chart abstraction (780 neonates at 18 centers) and apply modern statistical techniques to compare
their effectiveness for short-term (seizure cessation) and long-term (epilepsy by age 2) outcomes.
Demonstration of equivalence would favor the use of LEV, given its tolerability and safety profile. Second, if
neonates with seizures (age 0-28 days) continue ASM therapy in infancy (age 1-12 months), does ASM
selection alter the risk to develop infantile spasms syndrome (ISS)? Our preliminary analyses found an
association of oxcarbazepine (OXC) use with ISS, in alignment with recent work demonstrating that voltage-
gated sodium channel blockade can induce epileptic spasms in mice (using tetrodotoxin) and may increase the
risk for ISS in human infants (case reports and single-center data). This finding needs confirmation before
recommending avoidance of OXC in infants, particularly given the effectiveness of OXC and other voltage-
gated sodium channel blockers for some monogenetic epilepsies that begin in the first year of life. We will
confirm this finding in 587 infants. Third, after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, which infants will
develop epilepsy? We propose to validate our published epilepsy prediction rule in 1800 neonates for
subsequent use as enrollment criteria for epilepsy prevention trials. We will conduct this work using the
Pediatric Epilepsy Learning Health System (PELHS), a consortium of US academic pediatric epilepsy
programs that work collaboratively to improve outcomes for children with epilepsy through cycles of electronic
health record (EHR) collection and analysis. This rigorous set of studies will generate much-needed evidence
to support treatment decisions in a vulnerable population, in alignment with the 2020 Epilepsy Research
Benchmarks, including II-3 (biomarkers), II-5 (interventions to prevent epileptogenesis), and III-4 (predict,
prevent seizures). The proposal is aligned with a long-standing goal of clinical neuroscience research: to
predict and prevent epilepsy in high-risk individuals. The results will directly inform clinical care for neonates
with acute symptomatic seizures as well as lay the foundation for epilepsy prevention trials."

Persistent, intractable challenges with reading acquisition present critical educational and health concerns as
reading is a known indicator of lifetime earnings, general health, and overall wellbeing (OECD, 2012). Decades
of educational research has contributed to the development and testing of supplemental reading interventions
that provide intensive, targeted support to promote achievement for students with or at-risk for reading
disability (RD). However, to date, there has been no comprehensive exploration of racial differences in reading
intervention effectiveness. National data indicate that only 18% of Black students read at or above proficient
levels in fourth grade, compared to 45% of their White peers (NAEP, 2019). This gap does not narrow with age
(15% and 42% at eighth grade), nor has it narrowed over time (NAEP, 2019). Furthering our understanding of
these disparities in reading achievement requires scientific inquiry that disentangles the role of race in
determining intervention effectiveness. The exploration of racial differences has been dissuaded in part by a
lack of representation of Black students in educational and psychological research (e.g., Graham, 1992;
Graves et al., 2021; Lindo, 2006), and a predominantly race neutral approach to intervention development and
testing. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed project is to aggregate data from rigorous studies of
supplemental reading interventions for students with or at-risk for RD to investigate the presence of differential
intervention effects between Black and White students. We use a cross-disciplinary framework that integrates
bioecological systems theory, which recognizes sources of individual difference that stem from dynamic
interactions within and between our social environments, with QuantCrit, a methodological subfield of critical
race theory. Taken together, this framework recognizes that our interventions are likely not race neutral and
complex systems may differentially affect the effectiveness of these interventions for certain groups of
students. The proposed integrated dataset, representing more than 39 million dollars in federal research
investment, will be archived and shared on the LDbase data repository. By leveraging the existing
infrastructure of LDbase and making use of previously committed NIH resources, we are uniquely situated to
address the overall goal of the research project through three specific aims (SA). First, we will assemble an
integrated dataset with data from rigorous reading intervention studies (SA1). Second, we use the integrated
data to determine whether there are differential intervention effects for Black students compared to their White
peers (SA2). And finally, we identify characteristics of students, interventions, and outcomes that explain
differential response to reading intervention for Black students as compared to their White peers (SA3)."
10733457,"Project Summary/Abstract
Events in early life, particularly those altering the gut microbiota and immune development, can have an
important role in determining future risk of immune related disorders. For example, it has been reported that the
how substances are encountered by the immune system, the timing of feeding practices, hygiene, and the use
of antibiotics, in early life can modify the risk of immune driven disorders later in life. A common theme amongst
many of these studies is that these risk factors likely affect the developing microbiota. However, the biologic
basis for how early life microbial changes can affect the risk of immune disorders later in life is incompletely
understood. Previous data from our laboratories have suggested that during this preweaning period, specific live
gut bacteria are selectively delivered to the immune system and that interaction of these live bacteria with cellular
immune populations locally in the colonic lamina propria or in distant lymphoid tissues establishes a durable (life-
long) and balanced immune system. In preliminary studies, we observed substantial variance in the amount of
bacterial translocation in this preweaning period, which was corroborated with studies of antigen-specific T cell
responses to a translocating bacterial spp. We therefore hypothesize that the magnitude and quality of the
immune response to these translocating bacteria species during the preweaning period is a stochastic event
during normal ontogeny which represents an important variable in determining whether an individual establishes
a balanced immune system and prevents immune mediated pathologies in later life. However, the nature of
these translocating bacteria and methods to quantify the antigen-specific responses to these bacteria remain a
gap in our knowledge. We will address this question by identifying and characterizing how the translocating
bacteria are encountered by the immune system (Aim 1) and generate reagents to track bacterial antigen
presentation via T cell responses in vivo (Aim 2). We will use these reagents to integrate the immune response
over the preweaning period to translocating bacterial spp. during physiologic development and correlate it with
intestinal immune challenges including infection and experimental colitis in later life (Aim 3). If successful, this
project may reveal that preweaning translocation is an important stochastic developmental variable involved in
generating intestinal immune health and homeostasis."

Much work has been done to characterize the structural underpinnings of neuromodulatory systems and how
these architectural features shape neuromodulator action. Yet, although, neuromodulators primarily signal
through volume transmission which requires them to traverse the extracellular space (ECS) from release site to
target receptor, neuromodulatory diffusion through the ECS has received little attention. We know from
computational models that ECS diffusion is dependent on factors such as volume fraction, tissue tortuosity and
ECS geometry. Simulations so far have mainly focused on synaptic diffusion and synaptic spillover
mechanisms whereas neuromodulation functions at much larger spatiotemporal scales than that: even
neuromodulator diffusion through just layer IV in macaque cortex, for example, requires molecules to travel
distances up to 0.5 mm from release site to target receptor. Factors related to tissue porosity become
increasingly more important at such distances but current computer models like the common simulation engine
MCell are only equipped to study molecular diffusion at the nanometer scale. Consequently, we need updated
computational models capable of simulating the diffusion of neuromodulators across greater spatial and
temporal ranges capable of incorporating measures that become relevant at that macroscale. For this, I
propose to develop a hybrid model which will achieve this critical functionality by combining existing MCell
capabilities with large-scale algorithms from models of bulk diffusion. Because ECS diffusion is thought to vary
with brain regions which to date has not been systematically evaluated, I will then, with this multiscale model,
simulate diffusion of acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and dopamine across different regions of macaque cortex to
test how factors such as tissue granularity or tissue anisotropy affect common diffusion metrics (e.g.,
concentrations, diffusion rates, effective diffusion coefficients, and diffusion tensor). Since neuromodulatory
networks have been linked to virtually every brain function, understanding the dynamics of neuromodulator
diffusion across the brain is an important step in understanding normal brain function. Furthermore, because
changes in ECS dynamics and in neuromodulatory systems have been observed throughout development and
normal aging or with neuropathology like stroke-related ischemia and dementia, identifying key parameters that
determine signaling outcomes, but also the active processes by which they can be modified, may be key for
the advancement in diagnostics and therapeutics."
10778557,"It is a pivotal time for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) research to harness data sharing and
accelerate therapeutic discovery. Data sharing is important to advance research because it supports large data
sets that are more representative of the population, increasing the ability to detect generalizable contributors to
disease. Sharing data increases efficiency by allowing investigators to build upon each other’s work and prevents
redundant data generation. For of these reasons, the National Institutes of Health has committed to promoting
data sharing to accelerate research in the biosciences since 1997. Nevertheless, our preliminary data indicate
that in ADRD individual, institutional, and system-level barriers are impeding optimal data sharing. Furthermore,
the policies of institutions, publishers, and funders may be incompatible with one another, preventing or
discouraging investigators from sharing data. Efforts to exponentially expand ADRD research achievement
through data repositories and research consortia will fail to meet therapeutic discovery goals if investigators
cannot or will not share data. To address this risk and identify effective interventions to improve the prevalence
and quality of data sharing, current gaps in knowledge regarding ADRD investigators’ sharing practices,
perceptions of policies, and navigation of barriers must be closed. We propose to further explore these
provocative preliminary findings, collecting generalizable data to better understand ADRD investigators’
practices and perceptions of data sharing responsibilities. Such data would support development of interventions
that mitigate barriers considering unique challenges associated with conducting ADRD research and the
distinctive subculture of the field. Our goal is to provide ADRD investigators with tools that promote data sharing
and facilitate adherence to data sharing policies, including the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy
(effective 2023). We will conduct surveys with ADRD investigators to better understand the prevalence of data
sharing and withholding practices and gain clarity about barriers to data sharing. Following surveys, we will
conduct in-depth interviews with a subset of subjects to collect and analyze their narrative descriptions of barriers
to data sharing and how they navigate such barriers. This will provide rich understanding of investigators’ unique
experiences. Finally, we will compare investigators’ reported experiences with various policies that guide ADRD
scientific practices. This will include policies from journals, academic/research centers, repositories, consortia,
and others. We will make recommendations of interventions which might mitigate barriers to data sharing. This
study is critical to promoting optimal data sharing behaviors that are needed to advance therapeutic research in
ADRD."
10766761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The US health care system leads the world in administrative complexity and its associated costs. Research on
administrative costs has primarily focused on costs to the health care system and rarely includes patients,
though patients often perform a lot of administrative work, meaning the time, effort, and stress of navigating the
health system to obtain, pay for, and coordinate care. Cancer is a complex and often high-acuity condition with
persistent disparities in health outcomes, making cancer care delivery a priority setting for assessing patient
administrative burdens and identifying solutions. This program of research harnesses multiple methods to
define, measure, and describe the impact of patient administrative burden in cancer care delivery on quality
and care outcomes including oral anticancer agent adherence and guideline-recommended supportive care.
This early K99/R00 will establish Michael Anne Kyle, PhD, RN as an independent investigator focused on
improving the quality and value of cancer care delivery by reducing nonfinancial costs. Training goals in
advanced survey and psychometric methods and cancer care delivery will support Dr. Kyle’s success in her
research aims and transition to independence. An outstanding team of mentors will guide her training and
career development. The K99 phase focuses on defining patient administrative burden in cancer care delivery
and developing a survey instrument to measure it. It will engage patients or patient proxies in focus groups
elucidating the patient-facing nonclinical tasks involved in managing cancer care (Aim 1a). Qualitative insights
will inform the development and validation of a novel survey instrument measuring patient administrative
burden and its psychometric properties (Aim 1b). The R00 phase, will administer the validated patient
administrative burden survey to patients with cancer across a large NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center (Aim
2a). It will then link patient survey data with data on practice characteristics to examine the relationship
between organizational characteristics and administrative burden. (Aim 2b). Finally, it will link the survey with
patient-level utilization data burden to examine the relationship between administrative burden and cancer care
quality, including adherence to oral anticancer agents and adherence to guideline-recommended supportive
care (Aim 2c). Together, these results will enable the measurement and diagnosis of administrative burden
across cancer care settings and produce evidence identifying and motivating actionable organizational or
policy targets for clinical leaders and policymakers."

The overarching goal of this R21 Grant proposal is to identify the optimal timing of prehospital advance life
support (ALS) interventions for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The ALS interventions
include advanced airway management (AAM: i.e., endotracheal intubation and supraglottic airway placement)
and epinephrine administration. OHCA is a major public health problem worldwide, annually affecting over
356,000 Americans with substantially high rates of mortality and functional disability. Emergency medical
services (EMS) play an important role for patients with OHCA by providing initial prehospital care, including the
ALS interventions in the field. However, the optimal timing of the ALS interventions remains unclear. The 2019
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) Summary Statement, International Consensus on
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment
Recommendations identified the optimal time of both AAM and epinephrine administration as key knowledge
gaps. We recently found that, for adults with both shockable and nonshockable rhythms, benefit of epinephrine
decreased as the administration was delayed, using the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) registry, a
large multicenter OHCA registry in the United States and Canada. This R21 Grant project proposes to further
expand our research into AAM and pediatric population, analyzing the ROC data. Specific research Aims
include identifying the optimal timing of AAM (Aim 1A) and endotracheal intubation (Aim 1B) for adult patients
with OHCA, the optimal timing of AAM (Aim 2A) and endotracheal intubation (Aim 2B) for pediatric patients
with OHCA, and the optimal timing of epinephrine (Aim3) for pediatric patients with OHCA. This R21 Grant
application will provide the Principal Investigator (PI) with protected time to achieve research aims to improve
outcomes for patients with OHCA. The results of this R21 proposal will provide crucial information on the timing
of ALS interventions for OHCA and inform future national and international resuscitation guidelines."

Heteroresistance (HR) is a phenomenon in which minority populations of antibiotic resistant bacteria are maintained in
populations dominated by cells susceptible to that antibiotic. We have shown that HR is often undetected by clinical
diagnostics, but that the subpopulations of resistant cells present in HR can lead to in vivo treatment failure. It is critical to
gain a thorough understanding of HR in order to design more effective and sensitive diagnostics for its detection, and to
guide clinical treatment. One major unaddressed area of investigation is which parameters control the dynamics of the
resistant subpopulations in HR. The goal of Project 3 is to elucidate the dynamics of resistant subpopulations through
experimental testing, supported by quantitative modeling of the pharmaco-, population- and evolutionary dynamics of
heteroresistant bacteria. Importantly, this will include studies of both their dynamics upon antibiotic treatment as well as
the reversion of the population toward susceptibility upon removal of the drug. Toward this end we will develop and
analyze the properties of mathematical models of HR based on the mechanisms of heteroresistance derived from
molecular, genetic and single-cell microfluidic studies in Projects 1 and 2. The parameters used for the numerical analyses
of the properties of these models will be estimated with clinical isolates of HR Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter,
Escherichia, Klebsiella) and Acinetobacter baumannii obtained from Core B and studied in depth in Projects 1 and 2. For
each subpopulation we will estimate: (i) parameters of comprehensive pharmacodynamic functions, (ii) the rates of
transition between susceptible and resistant states, and (iii) the fitness costs of these resistant states. Using Hollow Fiber
Bioreactors, batch culture, and microfluidics, we will evaluate how well the models, with independent estimates of their
parameters, fit the pharmacodynamic of HR-bacteria confronted with antibiotics and, with continuous culture devices,
how well these models account for the dynamics of drug treatment of heteroresistant infections. In serial transfer culture
we will estimate the rates of transition to baseline susceptible states following the removal of the antibiotics. Based on the
results of these experiments, and in an iterative process, the models will be modified to make them more accurate and
predictive analogs of the pharmacodynamics of HR. For each HR isolate studied, we will also perform experiments to
determine if the frequency of the resistant subpopulations change as a consequence of antibiotic-mediated selection (i.e. if
the baseline frequency of the resistant cells increases), and elucidate if there are conditions under which HR will be
replaced by permanent resistance. The results from this research will for the first time, provide a broad and detailed
understanding of the dynamics of HR, facilitating an understanding of the parameters that control the frequency
of the resistant subpopulations. These studies will have a major impact on the development of diagnostic procedures to
detect HR and the design of protocols for treating infections with bacteria that exhibit HR to the treating antibiotic."

established leadership and scientific expertise in AD, tauopathy, aging, lysosomal biology, proteomics, and
metabolomics. The Core will consult with the SAB for overall program management and scientific direction.
The Core has also recruited individuals from BCM and WU who will offer support on institutional resources and
advice on conflict resolution if needed. The specific aims of the Administration and Data Integration Core are

Lysosomes are highly specialized and dynamic cellular organelles that help maintain protein homeostasis.
Lysosomes also act as a signaling center of the cell. Many of these signals are transduced to the nucleus and
ultimately modulate transcription of genes and the expression of protein products. This includes genes and
proteins that are essential to lysosome function and biogenesis. Dysregulation of lysosomal genes and the
dysfunction of the lysosome system are associated with aging and age-associated diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease. The Proteomics and Quantitative Post-translational Modification core (proteomics
core) (Core B) will support all three research projects in this PPG proposal to elucidate changes in the
proteome and the mechanisms by which protein expression is altered during aging and Alzheimer’s disease.
We will use methods as described in our preliminary data to measure changes in (1) the lysosomal
proteome, including isoforms and post-translational modifications, (2) post translational modifications in
lysosome-associated signaling events upstream of transcription, and (3) histone post-translational
modifications in lysosomal gene regulatory mechanisms. The proteomics core will leverage our expertise
and current capacity in the proteomic analysis of subcellular organelles, targeted proteomic characterization
and quantitation of protein modification state (proteoforms), as well as extensive expertise in signal
transduction and histone modifications. The focus of Core B is to provide reproducible quantitation and detailed
characterization of the lysosome and crucial proteins that are essential to the regulation of lysosomal biology in
aging and tauopathy. This level of molecular detail is important because protein attributes, such as isoforms,
proteolysis, and post-translational modifications, often function in concert or in specific hierarchies to execute
their core function. Together, these studies will provide unparalleled detailed characterization that reveal
molecular mechanisms of lysosome function, regulation, and biogenesis in aging biology, and Alzheimer’s
disease pathophysiology. Core B will also actively collaborate with other Cores and Projects to create a first-in-
class Aging- and Tauopathy-associated Lysosomal atlas (ATLas) of the lysosomal proteome and metabolome
for mouse cortex and hippocampus to be shared with the general research community."

Tauopathies consist of a group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementias and the most common form
Alzheimer’s disease, and are characterized by the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
composed of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and extensive neurodegeneration. Accumulating
evidence has implicated impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway in neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer’s disease. The Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) was discovered as a master regulator of cellular
clearance through coordinated expression of autophagy and lysosomal target genes. We have found that
TFEB is highly efficacious in ameliorating Tau/NFT pathology and behavioral deficits in Tau transgenic mice
while exhibiting no adverse effect on wild-type mice, supporting the premise that TFEB may serve as potential
therapeutic target. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate a Tau-induced TFEB lysosome-to-
nucleus signaling pathway regulating lysosomal homeostasis and cellular clearance in physiological and
tauopathy conditions and to identify strategies to augment this pathway for enhanced cellular clearance.
Specifically, through proteomics analysis of tauopathy mouse models, we will identify how Tau pathology
induces unique TFEB post-translational modifications and nuclear signaling. By leveraging the powerful
lysosomal purification and profiling system made available by the Program Project Grant investigators, we will
test how Tau pathology alters the lysosomal proteome, metabolome, and pH, the latter is essential for
lysosomal function and critically controlled by the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase). Accordingly, we will test the
specific TFEB/V-ATPase signaling in Tau pathogenesis and downstream glia and immune response. This
project is an integral component of the Program Project Grant aimed at understanding how lysosomal function
is regulated through lysosome-to-nucleus signaling pathways, how these pathways are changed in aging and
Alzheimer’s disease, and how to harness these regulatory pathways to promote brain health, combat age-
associated functional decline, and delay neurodegenerative diseases. This project, together with the
collaborative efforts of the Program Project Grant, will create a first-in-class Aging- and Tauopathy-associated
Lysosomal atlas (ATLas) of the lysosomal proteome and metabolome for mouse cortex and hippocampus
which will be made broadly available to the research community."

TMEM106B first came to the attention of the neurodegeneration community as a modifier of disease risk in
FTLD-TDP, where the protective haplotype was significantly less common in subjects than in healthy controls.
Since this discovery, TMEM106B's protective influence has been extended to hippocampal sclerosis in aging,
cognitive symptoms in ALS and PD, transcriptional indicators of brain aging, and functional resilience against
neuropathological burden. Given its impact, we know surprisingly little about TMEM106B function. TMEM106B
is localized to the late endosome and lysosome where past work suggests it regulates vesicle size and enzyme
content, but has been much less definitive about its effect on lysosomal function. The protective TMEM106B
haplotype is less transcriptionally active than the common (risk) variant and the only coding SNP identified
appears to increase protein turnover, together suggesting that mild reduction of TMEM106B levels may be
optimal for cognitive health. Based on past studies, we hypothesize that TMEM106B regulates lysosomal
homeostasis through both local protein interactions at the lysosome and through nuclear signaling via TFEB.
We further propose that this role becomes more critical with aging and disease, where lysosomal function must
be maintained under cellular stress. As a platform for testing how TMEM106B levels or isoform impact
lysosome composition and function in the healthy brain and under stress of aging or neuropathology, we have
generated an allelic series of mice in which TMEM106B levels have been constitutively reduced, deleted, or
substituted with a coding variant. In our first aim, we will test how TMEM106B levels affect lysosome pH, size,
and catabolic function in the healthy brain and under conditions of aging and tauopathy. In our second aim, we
will test whether TMEM106B influences lysosomal composition through local protein interactions, nuclear
transcription, or both. In our final aim, we will test how the lone coding variant affects TMEM106B localization
and lysosomal properties to determine whether this variant partially phenocopies TMEM106B loss of function.
In each aim, we will leverage the technical capabilities of our Metabolomics and Proteomics Cores and the
power of lysosomal immunoprecipitation to obtain an unbiased and up-close view of how lysosome
composition and catabolism is influenced by TMEM106B. The role of TMEM106B has yet to be clarified and
the existing literature is conflicted about its impact on the cell. But by tackling this protein in vivo under native
expression conditions using the tools and technologies afforded by our Program, we have an unparalleled
opportunity to conclusively determine how this protein influences lysosomal function in cells relevant to
Alzheimer's disease and under conditions of aging and tauopathy that attend dementia. Ultimately, we hope
that our work will offer mechanistic insight into the outsized influence held by this non-descript lysosomal
protein across a growing swath of neurodegenerative conditions."
10806944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multi-parameter hemodynamic monitoring is needed to manage surgical and intensive care patients.
Monitoring blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (CO), and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), in
particular, permits detection of frequent hypotension and hemodynamic instability, diagnosis of the
cause for selecting appropriate therapy, and titration of interventions (e.g., goal-directed therapy).
However, measurement of these three hemodynamic variables currently requires multiple devices
that are invasive, manual, or specialized. While the oscillometric arm cuff device is non-invasive,
automated, and standard, it only estimates BP from the measured cuff pressure waveform via a
population average algorithm that does not maintain accuracy over the clinical range. The overall
goal of this project is to extend the ubiquitous arm cuff device for accurate and convenient multi-
parameter hemodynamic monitoring via smart algorithms. The specific aims are: (1) to build an arm
cuff device for recording cuff pressure waveforms; (2) to simultaneously acquire patient data with this
and reference devices for algorithm training; (3) to develop and incorporate algorithms for accurately
computing BP, CO, and EF from the cuff pressure waveform based on the training data; and (4) to
validate the real-time Smart Cuff against reliable reference measurements in patients. The device will
be developed to control the cuff pressure and incorporate custom algorithms. The cuff pressure
waveform via the device and reference BP, CO, and EF via arterial and pulmonary artery catheters
and echocardiography will be recorded before and after clinical interventions in many surgical and
intensive care patients. These training data will be analyzed to refine or adapt previous physiologic
algorithms and to investigate potentially superior machine learning algorithms for best estimation of
the three hemodynamic variables. The final algorithms will be implemented for a real-time device,
and the integrated system will be tested against the same reference measurements during clinical
interventions but from new patients. Achievement of the specific aims will be followed by a
translational project to bring the Smart Cuff to patient care and a research project to extend the
device capabilities including addition of automated clinical decision support. Ultimately, these efforts
may help in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs in the near-term."
10832480,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating illness with a poor prognosis, and
both the incidence and prevalence of IPF among U.S. Veterans has increased during the last 10
years. In addition, the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis developing following acute lung injury
has been prominent in survivors of COVID-19. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the
development of fibrosis are not completely understood. The fundamental processes develop
due to genetic abnormalities and/or environmental factors that lead to repetitive injury to the
alveolar epithelium, dysregulated epithelial repair mechanisms, and an increase in fibroblasts
and (apoptosis-resistant) myofibroblasts that produce excessive extracellular matrix. IPF is
more prevalent in men than in women, but the reasons for the differences are not well
understood. Apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen activated protein kinase
kinase kinase (MAP3K5) that is activated by oxidative stress and causes stimulation of MAPK
pathways, but the downstream signaling pathways are highly tissue dependent and have not
been investigated in the context of pulmonary fibrosis. The overall objective of this application
is to establish that ASK1 is a central mediator of the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that ASK1 promotes pulmonary fibrosis by p38-mediated
inflammation and stimulation of ERK1/2-mediated pathways, and that these pathways are
regulated in part by sex hormones. The rationale for the proposed research is that the
identification of ASK1 as a central regulator in the development of fibrosis will advance our
fundamental understanding and lead to new therapeutic options for the treatment of IPF
patients. These mechanisms will be investigated using both ASK1-deficient mice and an ASK1
inhibitor in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model. In addition, primary cultures of alveolar
type II epithelial cell and fibroblasts, as well as cell lines with knockdown of ASK1 and other key
mediators, will be used to define specific ASK1-dependent pathways. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that fibrosis is exacerbated by repetitive oxidative stress that activates p38 signaling
via ASK1, and that these pathways are regulated by sex hormones. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that sex-dependent differences in ASK1 and ERK1/2 activation stimulate pro-fibrotic
pathways. These studies will advance our fundamental understanding of fibrosis and sex
differences and establish ASK1 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce the progression of
IPF."
10806948,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Numerous studies indicate that adult stem cells exert their functional benefits mainly through paracrine
effects, i.e., secreted factors from stem cells promote cardiac regeneration and inhibit fibrosis and
inflammation. However, two major challenges remain to efficiently delivery stem cell factors to the injured
myocardium: 1) injected growth factors are quickly diffused, therefore sustained release is needed; 2) local
injection is effective but requires open chest procedure, systemic injection is safe but cannot get sufficient
dosage to the heart, therefore targeted delivery is needed. To overcome those challenges, we designed a
platelet-inspired nano-cell (PINC) that has a core containing stem cell factors and a platelet membrane shell for
injury binding. The core consists of therapeutic CSC-secreted factors encapsulated in a biodegradable poly
(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle for sustained release. The platelet membrane is conjugated with
PGE2 which is expected to have targetability to cardiovascular cells and facilitate the endogenous repair
through PGE2/EP receptor signaling after I/R injury. As a novel biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticle, PINC
offers the following advantages compared to natural stem cells: (i) PINC is small enough for systemic
administration: the nano size of PINC enables intravenous application; unlike stem cells, PINCs are less likely
to be blocked by the lungs; (ii) PINC has dual targeting ability: the platelet membrane on PINCs targets injured
blood vessels while the PGE2 targets injured cardiomyocytes in MI; (iii) PINC is stable during storage: unlike
real stem cells, PINCs can be readily manipulated and cryopreserved since there are no living components.
The Specific Aims are: AIM 1. Fabricate PINC particles functionalized with PGE2 and CSC secretome; Test the
in vitro potency and cytotoxicity of PINC; AIM 2. Determine the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of PINC
therapy in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury; AIM 3. Translate the findings into a clinically-relevant
porcine model of IR injury. Our study will form the foundation for an innovative and “off the shelf” therapy based
on secreted factors and targeted nanomedicine that can be standardized from donor stem cell lines and
xenogeneic cardiac tissues. The cell-free nature of our approach is more readily translatable to the clinic.
Although this particular grant application targets the heart and cardiac stem cells, our approach represents a
platform technology that can be applied to the creation of multiple types of synthetic stem cell and organ
matrices for the repair of various other organs."
10809042,"Project Summary and Abstract
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an increasingly prevalent chronic disease marked by aberrant immune
responses and intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation. IBD is comorbid with cardiovascular disease and
associated with decreased blood flow to the intestines, with a critical but poorly-studied role for the mesenteric
(MAs) arteries that regulate intestinal perfusion. Perivascular sensory nerves (PSNs) continuously innervate the
MA adventitia and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), regulating vasomotor function and facilitating blood flow
by dilating MAs and inhibiting sympathetic vasoconstriction. With IBD, these PSN functions are severely
impaired, and the PVAT that is normally anticontractile becomes procontractile through an unknown mechanism,
further impairing MA dilation. The sensory neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance
P (SP) may also be important in these IBD-related vascular dysfunctions, as they are linked to disease severity
and can mediate perivascular neuro-immune and neuro-adipose signaling through activation of local immune
cells. Previous work demonstrates that macrophages accumulate in both the MA adventitia and PVAT during
IBD, and macrophage depletion restores the ability of PSNs to dilate MAs and inhibit sympathetic constriction.
This suggests that perivascular macrophages can modulate arterial function with IBD, likely through a
mechanism involving sensory neurotransmitters in the adventitia and PVAT. What remains unclear is how
macrophages participate in PSN, PVAT, and blood flow dysfunction and when these changes occur in IBD
development. This project will test the overall hypothesis that PSN neurotransmitter released in adventitia and
PVAT of MAs promotes macrophage activation, accumulation, and inflammatory mediator release, leading to
vasomotor defects and impaired blood flow early in IBD pathogenesis. To investigate these relationships, the
immune-driven, Helicobacter hepaticus-induced IL10-/- mouse model of IBD will be used to address 3 research
Aims. Aim 1 will use confocal imaging, flow cytometry, and in vivo blood flow measurements at timepoints
throughout IBD development to determine when macrophage infiltration causes PSN and PVAT dysfunction and
impairs blood flow compared to the development of colon inflammation. Aim 2 will use sensory denervation and
transgenic mice lacking PVAT in conjunction with isolated artery preparations to determine whether the presence
and activity of PSNs and/or PVAT drive macrophage infiltration around MAs with IBD. Aim 3 will use advanced
imaging, primary adventitial and PVAT macrophages, and biochemical assays to test whether sensory
neuropeptides can activate macrophages from the MA adventitia and PVAT to release inflammatory mediators.
This project will uniquely define the role of PSNs and their signaling pathways in neuro-immune-adipose
interactions mediating vasomotor function, and it will determine how these pathways are affected during the
pathogenesis of IBD. Results will provide new insight towards developing selective therapeutic strategies for
treating vascular dysfunction and impaired intestinal blood flow to improve quality of life for IBD patients."
10795093,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biology is undergoing a revolution, where biomolecular condensates are upending our understanding in much
of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. These condensates, formed through phase separation, mediate
crucial cellular functions and are linked with neurodegeneration and cancer. Yet we are only starting to gain a
glimpse of physical understanding of the properties and complex behaviors of biomolecular condensates. A main
goal of this project is to bridge the widening gap in understanding between the biology and physics of phase
separation. Building on the strong foundations laid in the previous funding period, we will integrate theoretical,
computational, and experimental approaches to tackle the enormous challenges in interpreting microscale
biological phenomena in terms of the conformations and interactions of the constituent macromolecules.
Questions to be addressed include: (1) computing the effects of point mutations and posttranslational
modifications on phase equilibrium; (2) quantifying nonspecific interactions in condensates; (3) measuring
molecular and material properties of condensates; and (4) modeling condensate aging. Some of the challenges
arise from intrinsically disordered regions ubiquitously present in macromolecules that drive phase separation.
We will therefore carry out comprehensive studies into the conformational and dynamic properties of intrinsically
disordered proteins and their pathways when forming specific complexes with partners. While the latter specific,
bimolecular interactions represent the traditional paradigm of molecular recognition, phase separation defines a
paradigm of molecular recognition at the microscale, mediated by weak, nonspecific interactions among an
ensemble of molecules. A third paradigm of molecular recognition is semi-specific association of proteins with
membranes, where the conformation and pose of the bound protein and the composition of the proximal lipids
are all highly dynamic. We will deeply probe the semi-specific association of WASP and synaptogamins with
acidic membranes to fill in critical gaps in their functional mechanisms. The planned research will not only
advance fundamental understanding in biology but also yield new opportunities for designing therapies."

Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a major global pathogen, with 1.7 million new infections in 2019.
The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole virus-surface antigen. Env, a trimer of gp120/gp41 dimer
subunits, is densely glycosylated by N-glycans. For the gp120 subunit, N-glycans contribute over 50% of its
molecular mass and form a protective surface, the so-called “glycan shield”, that interacts with cellular receptors
and the immune system and protects the virus from neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Recently, the concept of an
“evolving glycan shield” has been proposed, based on the sequence analysis of immune-escape variants that
have lost some potential N-glycosylation sites (NGS) and gained others. Despite significant strides in
understanding the biology of HIV-1 Env, the complexity and function of N-glycans at a molecular level are poorly
understood. Based on our bioinformatics and experimental studies, we recently proposed that the Env glycan
shield may be defined, and analyzed, as distinct structural glycan-microdomains. Using naturally occurring Env
variants of a clade B virus, we analyzed the glycans surrounding the highly conserved N262 glycan, in the so-
called high-mannose patch (HMP) near the apex of the Env trimer. These HMP glycans, comprised of different
combinations of 4 to 6 NGS in the proximity of N262, appear to form a glycan working unit. Based on our
published results and preliminary data, we hypothesize that Env outer domain, gp120 glycan shield, has
structural components that can be defined as distinct structural glycan-microdomains. We propose to
test our hypothesis in different clades of HIV-1 and their immune-escape variants by assessing structural and
functional impacts of a range of N-glycan combinations that comprise Env glycan-microdomains. Specifically,
we propose to determine how different NGS combinations of the N262-anchored HMP-microdomain across
variants and clades influence Env functions (Aim 1), to probe the structural arrangement of different N262-glycan
cluster NGS combinations in the context of functional recombinant Env trimers (Aim 2), and to assess the
functional impacts of other potential glycan-clusters of the HIV-1 Env glycan shield (Aim 3). To accomplish these
goals, we will use a combination of functional, bioanalytical, structural bioinformatics, and molecular dynamics
simulation approaches. The results of these studies will test our proposed hypothesis on the functional impact
of the structural components of the glycan shield, glycan-microdomains, and will determine how the varied
compositions of these microdomains affect the function of the glycan shield. These data will advance our
understanding of the molecular biology of HIV-1 and the factors that impact viral transmission and persistence.
Ultimately, these studies will generate new information about Env vulnerabilities that can be exploited to develop
future therapeutic approaches."

Coronary microvascular dysfunction or disease (CMD) may lead to angina pectoris or acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), which is considered as one of major
mechanisms of ischemia heart disease (IHD). However, the pathogenesis of CMD remains unclear. Based on
literature and our previous studies, we wondered whether exosomes or other microvesicles-mediated signaling
from endothelial cells (ECs) serve as a crucial mechanism mediating CMD because much thinner endothelium-
smooth muscle (EC-SM) space in small coronary arteries (CAs) or arterioles than large arteries may limit the
development of typical atherogenic pathology, but the exosome-carrying molecules may result in functional
abnormality in these small coronary arteries. Our preliminary studies indeed demonstrated that exosomes were
increasingly secreted into subendothelial space in small coronary arteries in mice fed the Western diet (WD)
and that deletion of lysosomal acid ceramidase (AC) in coronary ECs from Asah1fl/fl/ECcre mice, a strain of EC-
specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1 is mouse gene code of AC) resulted in accumulation or trapping of
exosomes in the EC-SM space, leading to CMD-mediated myocardial ischemia without atherosclerosis and
obstructive CAD. The present grant proposal will test a central hypothesis that endothelium-derived exosomes
regulated by lysosomal AC-mediated sphingolipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the control of small CA
function and that subendothelial exosome accumulation is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of CMD. To
test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether exosome
secretion from coronary arterial ECs is fine controlled by lysosomal AC activity and whether the deficiency of
this AC regulation causes subendothelial accumulation of exosomes in small CAs of Asah1fl/fl/ECcre mice,
leading to CMD and myocardial ischemia without atherosclerosis and obstructive CAD. Specific Aim 2
attempts to test whether lysosomal AC-mediated sphingolipid signaling regulates lysosome trafficking to and
fusion with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to limit exosome secretion from ECs and whether pathologically
released exosomes from ECs with gene deletion from Asah1fl/fl/ECcre mice induce dysfunction of coronary
arterial SMCs. In Specific Aim 3, we will address whether the AC regulation of lysosome trafficking and
exosome secretion from coronary ECs are attributed to its action on lysosomal TRPML1 channel activity and
associated Ca2+ release and whether the deficiency of this regulatory mechanism leads to subendothelial
exosome accumulation and CMD. To our knowledge, these proposed studies will represent the first effort to
investigate the pathogenic role of subendothelial exosomes in CMD and consequent myocardial ischemia and
the findings will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CMD and IHD without atherosclerosis or
obstructive CAD."
10757684,"Abstract: Compared to hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer (BC), basal or triple negative BC (TNBC)
suffers a poor prognosis and limited treatment options because of the lack of understanding of its driver signaling
pathways. Mitochondrial retrograde signaling is a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus.
We have previously published that TNBC has energy dependency to mitochondrial FA β-oxidation (FAO). FAO
induces tumor and metastatic potential of TNBC. Src oncopathway is one of the most frequently upregulated
pathways in TNBC and a critical player of TNBC metastasis. Like most protein kinases, Src family kinases (SFKs)
require phosphorylation within a segment of the kinase for its full catalytic activity. Src is mainly phosphorylated
(pSrc) at either Y419 (active state) or Y530 (inactive state). Compared to most BC subgroups, pSrc (Y419) is
significantly upregulated in TNBC subgroups. However, how pSrc oncopathway is activated in TNBC was largely
unknown. In this context, our lab made a breakthrough discovery that in TNBC, FAO regulates the
phosphorylation of Src at Y419 without any major impact on the phosphorylation of Y530. Though we have
shown that FAO inhibition decreases the pSrc (Y419), so far, the mechanism of this critical regulation is not fully
understood. Only very fewer proteins have been proposed for the removal of phosphorylation from pSrc (Y419).
Disabled-2 (DAB2), is known to bind at SH3 domain of Src and directly suppress the Y419 phosphorylation. This
dephosphorylation results in the inactivation for Src without affecting the phosphorylation at Y530. Previous
studies have suggested that the epigenetic transcriptional downregulation of DAB2 is a major determinant of
cancer progression and clinical outcome. FA and FAO metabolites are known to epigenetically modify nuclear
genes. Our strong preliminary data using different models suggest that the FAO downregulate the DAB2 mRNA
in TNBC. Moreover, HDAC inhibitors activate DAB2 mRNA in TNBC cells. All these suggest that FAO may be
epigenetically regulating DAB2. Thus, in this project we will evaluate how FAO-mediated retrograde signaling
epigenetically modify the tumor suppressor DAB2. We will also analyze if such regulation of DAB2 is critical in
the FAO-mediated activation of Src oncopathway in TNBC. In Aim-1, FAO-mediated transcriptional regulation of
DAB2 will be confirmed using TNBC cell lines and already available tumor tissues collected after long-term
treatment with FAO inhibitors in mice bearing TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. We also have
TNBC cells after stably knocking down FAO rate-limiting enzymes. Aim-2 will analyze the epigenetic
modifications of DAB2 promoter after metabolic modulation. Overall, this will be one of the first mechanical
studies in TNBC to show how the mitochondrial retrograde regulation modulate a tumor suppressor gene to
control a major oncopathway via its post-translational regulation. The investigator team is well experienced in
the proposed studies and supported by other core facilities. Strong preliminary data and previous publications
support the feasibility of this project."
10764956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A single toxicant exposure during development can produce negative outcomes in adulthood and subsequent
generations, presenting a major hurdle in the prevention and treatment of disease. In addition, given the
susceptibility to toxicants amid degenerative biological and genetic processes, exposure during old age is a
critical sensitive window. Despite their significance, however, the mechanisms that mediate both processes are
poorly understood. Lead (Pb) remains one of ten World Health Organization-identified toxicants of major public
health concern, even though there have been decades-long efforts to manage the routes of environmental
exposure. Numerous studies have demonstrated potent neurotoxic effects of lead exposure on gene
expression and the epigenome, resulting in outcomes such as impaired I.Q., behavioral dysregulation, and
speech and learning deficits. Our long-term goal is to determine how environmental toxicants interfere with
neurobehavior during critical windows so that evidence-based strategies to prevent and treat adult-onset and
transgenerational disease can be developed. The overall objective for this NIEHS R01 Award (PA-20-185)
application is to determine genome function alterations and epigenetic regulation of environmentally-influenced
neurobehavioral phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that environmentally relevant Pb exposure during
critical sensitive windows (early development and old age) lead to genomic and epigenetic dysregulation that
alters neurogenesis pathway function in the exposed and subsequent generations. The rationale for the
proposed research is that investigation of the mechanisms underlying Pb-induced outcomes will advance
prevention, risk-assessment, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. Guided by strong preliminary data, this
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine life stage-specific transcriptomic
changes in neurogenesis pathways following developmental and geriatric exposure to environmentally relevant
Pb levels; 2) Determine emergent changes in the epigenome related to phenotypic and genetic endpoints; 3)
Determine multigenerational and transgenerational transcriptomic and epigenetic changes induced by
ancestral exposure. Ultimately, these results will identify critical windows for biomarkers of effect, and inform
the interplay among pathways mediating toxic endpoints."

 The overarching goal of my proposal is to acquire technical and professional skills to become an
independent investigator at a leading academic institution and develop a research program deciphering the
molecular mechanism of inflammation induced prostatic tissue remodeling and fibrosis. This will be pursued
through a scientific project that will determine whether osteopontin, a pro-fibrotic secreted phosphoprotein,
stimulates prostatic inflammation, fibrosis, and lower urinary tract dysfunction.
 My training is focused on four key areas: 1) functional testing of mouse urinary function, 2) developing
biomedical engineering technologies to study prostatic fibrosis in vitro, 3) testing and further developing animal
models to study inflammation-induced prostatic fibrosis and its consequences on urinary function and, 4)
gaining essential training in immune-regulated tissue remodeling. UW-Madison and the UW O`Brien Center for
Benign Urology Research presents a unique environment for the proposed research and career development
activities. This includes seminars presented by local and national leaders of the field, career development
activities of several institutes across campus, clinical training of the Department of Urology, and specific
training in immunopathology and tissue engineering.
 Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic diseases deteriorate the quality of
life as men age. The treatment of male LUTS costs $4 billion annually and presents an economic burden on
our healthcare system. It has been recently identified that prostatic inflammation and fibrosis are associated
with LUTS, but the exact contribution of these mechanism to urinary dysfunction is unknown. Medical therapies
targeting inflammation and fibrosis could enhance drug development and provide novel molecular targets for
LUTS. Based on my preliminary studies, I hypothesize that inflammation-induced osteopontin levels stimulate
prostatic fibrosis and lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). The hypothesis will be tested by the following
aims:
 1) Test the hypothesis that OPN is required for inflammation-induced prostatic collagen accumulation
 and LUTD,
 2) Test the hypothesis that OPN induces prostatic fibrosis.
 The proposal will provide novel detection of collagen deposition, 3D in vitro and in vivo models of
prostatic fibrosis. It will also decipher the specific role of inflammation-induced prostatic fibrosis in lower urinary
tract dysfunction. This will be achieved by capitalizing on recently established prostatic inflammation models
and state-of-the-art urinary physiological tests uniquely available at the UW-Madison."

Understanding and mitigating the health impacts of climate change and other environmental exposures requires
information on population and agricultural characteristics at the community level—a key scale for decision-
making and action. Population and housing censuses and agricultural censuses provide in-depth, community-
scale data on demographics, education, employment, and living conditions as well as on farming inputs,
practices, and productivity. Currently, these data are difficult to access and use for research and decision-
making. While nearly every country conducts regular censuses, the results are published independently by
hundreds of statistical agencies, often in reports designed for reading rather than for analysis. The proposed
project—the IPUMS International Historical Geographic Information System (IPUMS IHGIS)—will assemble
these data in an analysis-ready, standardized, and fully documented collection and make them freely available
via a user-friendly web-based interface. These data will allow researchers to better answer a wide range of
environmental health questions, such as what population-level factors contribute to the spread of vector-borne
disease or where people are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. The project has four Aims: (1) Ingest
population and agricultural census data. Using software developed with NSF funding, data and boundaries for
approximately 25,000 additional tables from 250 censuses will be added to the IHGIS database, a ten-fold
increase to the current collection. Data from countries most vulnerable to health impacts from climate change
and providing the finest geographic detail available will be prioritized. (2) Enable linkages between census data
and health data, allowing users to attach community-level census data to individual-level health survey data from
the Demographic and Health Surveys, Performance Monitoring for Action surveys, and Multiple Indicator Cluster
Surveys. The project will also develop a utility to provide geographic unit codes for user-uploaded coordinates,
so researchers can link their own health data to IHGIS contextual data. (3) Improve standardization and
integration across datasets to support comparisons across time and between countries. Enhancements to the
software will enable filtering and selection based on topics and level of geographical detail, standardize units of
measurement, and create integrated versions of selected data tables. (4) Support and expand the IHGIS user
base through online tutorials, virtual and in-person workshops, webinars, and one-to-one user support to develop
a broad community of new and established environmental-health researchers using IHGIS data. Outreach efforts
will focus on reaching, training, and supporting a diverse—in background, discipline, and career stage—
community of environmental health researchers. By providing rich, detailed, and expansive information on
characteristics of populations around the world, IHGIS data will also further the NIEHS goals of developing a
program in global environmental health and understanding health disparities and risks for vulnerable populations."

 One of the most fundamental properties of cells is the ability to transduce signals to other
cells and the surrounding environment. Well recognized modes of cellular signaling include direct
cell-cell interactions via membrane receptors and ligands and the release of soluble factors, such
as growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. The more recently described extracellular vesicle
(EV) is now also considered as an important mediator of cell signaling, allowing cells to exchange
proteins, lipids and genetic material. EVs are secreted from nearly all cell types and EV-based
communication relies on the ability of vesicles to deliver bioactive molecules to other cells. The
field of EV biology is rapidly evolving and expanding, affecting almost all biomedical disciplines,
from oncology and obstetrics to infectious diseases and stem cell biology. Cells release EVs not
only in culture but also in vivo, and diverse types of vesicles have been isolated and analyzed
from almost all bodily fluids, leading to the postulation that EV-based liquid biopsies can be used
for diagnostics. However, despite the excitement and hundreds of new publications on EVs in
recent past, several basic hypotheses regarding their function remain experimentally untested. A
major challenge in EV research is the huge and often underappreciated diversity in shed vesicles.
Many of the impediments to advance EV biology and application, stem from the inability to
separate a complex population of vesicles into subclasses of particular sizes, compositions, and
biogenesis pathways. Microvesicles (MVs) are an EV subtype which are shed by the direct
outward budding of the plasma membrane. They are present in biological fluids and appear to be
involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, much remains unknown
regarding the biogenesis and role of these vesicles as signaling mediators. Here we propose
strategies to catalog molecular cargoes targeted specifically to MVs and identify new regulators
of cargo loading. We also aim to interrogate GTPase-regulated cell signaling pathways that
regulate MV release. Finally, we will examine the interactions of MVs with receptors on endothelial
cells and consequent signaling pathways activated in the recipient cell. These studies will provide
new insights into a rapidly evolving frontier in signal transduction, as well as the molecular basis
of various diseases."
10762985,"Project Summary
Invasive fungal infection has high occurrence and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Most of
the currently available antifungal agents targeting the cell membrane have limited efficacy, relatively high
toxicity, and an observed increase in drug resistance. The cell wall of fungal pathogens is a promising target
for antifungal drugs due to its absence in humans. Still, such efforts have been hindered by our inadequate
knowledge of the cell wall organization. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the structures
of cell walls of prevalent fungal pathogens at the molecular level to promote the development of wall-
targeting therapeutics against infections. This project aims to develop solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (ssNMR) technology that allows understanding the nanoscale remodeling of fungal cell wall
structures involved in fungal virulence and drug resistance. The central hypothesis is that the fungal cell
walls’ structural dynamics and mechanical properties are major factors contributing to virulence and drug
resistance. This central hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims. We will interrogate the polymorphic
structure of major structural polysaccharides and their supramolecular packing in the cell walls of three major
fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans.
Second, we will determine the structural dynamics of the cell wall and the remodeling process of the
biopolymer composite induced by antifungal echinocandins and nikkomycin that target, respectively, β-
glucan and chitin, two of the major cell wall components. Third, we will examine cell wall structures of
naturally occurring mutant strains of A. fumigatus and C. albicans showing modulated susceptibility to
antifungal agents and the superbug Candida auris to identify the structural mechanisms underlying altered
drug responses. We will pursue these aims by establishing an innovative approach that combines ssNMR
and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) techniques to enable high-resolution and non-destructive
characterization of intact and living fungal cells. The project is significant because it will identify the essential
carbohydrate components and their structures or packing interfaces that serve as the potential targets for
discovering novel antifungal compounds with broad spectrums and improved efficacy. Our efforts will yield
a collection of structural diagrams of cell walls across three major fungal pathogens and their responses to
antifungal agents and mutations. The research will define a new biophysical direction bridging the long-
standing gap between biomedical observations of fungal phenotypes and the fundamental understanding of
structures and interactions of biomolecules at atomic levels. The methodology established here will also
permit the high-resolution assessment of structural effects of antifungal agents that are available or being
developed, which will revolutionize antifungal drug design."
10778623,"Recent large-scale clinical studies report that women with a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) have abnormally
high rates of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy, despite clinical evidence of renal
recovery prior to conception as defined by measurement of serum creatinine. We established a pregnancy
post-AKI model in Sprague Dawley rats using ischemia reperfusion (IR) as an experimental model of AKI which
recapitulates many of the clinical findings, including fetal growth restriction. The goal of this proposal is to
address a critical gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which AKI predisposes females to adverse
outcomes in pregnancy. Our central hypothesis is that AKI prior to conception impairs the renal, hemodynamic
and immune adaptations required for a healthy pregnancy by decreasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Normal
pregnancy is characterized by profound adaptations in almost every organ system to meet the demands of the
fetus while maintaining the physiological needs of the mother. NO is a central mediator of the renal and
cardiovascular adaptations in healthy pregnancy, and decreases in NO bioavailability lead to adverse maternal
and fetal outcomes, including low birth weight. We have also shown that NO synthase (NOS) is required for
females to increase T regulatory cells (Tregs), and failure to expand Tregs in pregnancy induces renal and
vascular dysfunction in the mother and promotes fetal growth restriction. There is growing evidence that the
renal NOS system is impaired following AKI in males. The impact of AKI on NO/NOS in females is unknown.
The impact of AKI on physiological adaptations to pregnancy, including increases in NO bioavailability are
unknown. Our hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data showing AKI prior to pregnancy 1)
decreases renal NOS expression prior to conception and in pregnancy, 2) results in subclinical injury prior to
pregnancy and renal injury in pregnancy, 3) impairs plasma volume expansion, 4) impairs vascular function in
pregnancy, and 5) decreases Treg expansion in pregnancy. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that AKI induces
reductions in NO bioavailability that are exacerbated in pregnancy resulting in renal and vascular dysfunction.
We propose that AKI results in the failure to appropriately increase NO-mediated hemodynamic adaptations and
loss of NO-mediated plasma volume expansion leading to poor maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy. Aim
2 will test the hypothesis that failure to upregulate Tregs in pregnancy contributes to adverse pregnancy
outcomes post-AKI. We will determine how AKI prior to pregnancy impacts Tregs and if increasing Tregs during
pregnancy improves fetal growth and maternal outcomes. We propose that AKI results in the failure to increase
NO which is required for Treg expansion, contributing to further decreases in NO. Results will provide a critically
needed pre-clinical foundation to elucidate the mechanisms underlying poor pregnancy outcomes after AKI, give
evidence for improved pre- and perinatal care guidelines, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for
clinical trials."

Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive, incurable disease that affects over 2 million individuals in the United States
alone and over 60 million worldwide. Sensitive detection of early glaucoma damage is not only essential for
vision preservation, but also can facilitate new neuroprotective therapy developments. In this proposal, we focus
on two novel imaging markers enabled by visible light optical coherence tomography (VIS-OCT), namely the
reflectance spectral marker from retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular oxygen consumption. We showed
in our recent cross-sectional clinical study that peripapillary RNFL reflectance spectral marker and arteriovenous
oxygen saturation difference in the macular region better separated early stage of glaucoma suspect/pre-
perimetric glaucoma eyes from normal ones than circumpapillary RNFL and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC)
thickness. These promising results lead to three specific goals in the project. First, we will develop a second-
generation dual channel VIS-OCT device to improve the resolution, total imaging range, and image quality to
achieve near shot-noise limit performance. Second, we propose to characterize the macular oxygen
consumption by combining blood oxygen saturation and flow and correlated with glaucoma severity. Macular
region contains >30% of total RGCs in retina and is involved in early events in glaucoma. The macular visual
damage impacts the quality of life the most since it is at the center of our vision. For the first time, we will provide
quantitative assessment of macular oxygen consumption in a spectrum of glaucoma severity and shed light in
the pathological role of vascular function in the early-stage glaucoma. Finally, we propose a prospective study
to correlate VIS-OCT imaging markers, including RNFL reflectance spectral markers and macular oxygen
markers, with the glaucoma worsening. We will evaluate whether VIS-OCT markers can detect the early
damages proceeding to vision functional loss at a later point. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH: The successful
completion of this program will rigorously evaluate the clinical performances of new VIS-OCT markers for early
glaucoma detection, which is highly impactful in clinical care and blindness prevention."

10754270,"Uterine leiomyomas (LM, fibroids) disrupt uterine function and cause recurrent pregnancy loss, excessive uterine
bleeding, and anemia in 15-30% of reproductive-age women. No long-term medical treatment is available.
Understanding how a LM develops is essential for identifying new non-surgical treatments. MED12 mutations
(mut-MED12) occur in 70% of all LM and drive LM growth in a steroid hormone-dependent manner. Pre- and
peri-menopausal women are widely exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), e.g., phthalates, which
are found in many consumer products and associated with a number of reproductive diseases. How a mut-
MED12 influences LM growth and whether this process is enhanced by exposure to EDCs remain unknown. We
recently found that tryptophan (Trp) 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) gene expression is strikingly upregulated in mut-
but not wild-type (wt)-MED12 LM. TDO2 catalyzes a critical step in Trp breakdown to kynurenine (Kyn), an
endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) whose activation stimulates the expression of pro-
growth genes to promote cell survival and proliferation in various tissues. Kyn levels are markedly higher in LM
vs myometrium, particularly in mut-MED12 LM. Trp and Kyn treatments of LM cells activated AHR and increased
cell survival; blocking the Trp-Kyn-AHR pathway by siRNA knockdown or inhibitors of TDO2 or AHR abolished
these effects, with mutant LM cells showing higher sensitivity to the treatments. Epidemiological studies have
shown positive associations between LM and exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). In vitro, mono(2-
ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), a major metabolite of DEHP, stimulated the expression of Trp
transporters (LAT1 and LAT2), increased Trp uptake and Kyn production, activated AHR, and promoted LM cell
survival. In addition, progesterone receptor is crucial for the expression of AHR and its nuclear translocator
ARNT. Thus, the Trp-Kyn-AHR pathway appears to be a hub at which mut-MED12, steroid hormone action, and
EDC effects converge enabling LM growth. Our overall hypothesis is that increased Trp uptake and metabolism,
Kyn production, and AHR pathway activation, as a result of mut-MED12 or high exposure to the environmental
pollutant DEHP, promote cell survival and proliferation and lead to LM growth. Using a xenograft mouse model
and genome-wide studies, we will test our hypothesis in the following Aims: (1) Define the functional role of the
Trp-Kyn-AHR pathway in LM tumorigenesis. Hypothesis: elevated expression of the TDO2 enzyme in mut-
MED12 LM causes Kyn overproduction that activates AHR and promotes proliferation and survival of smooth
muscle cells and tumor growth. (2) Determine whether DEHP stimulates LM growth via activation of the Trp-
Kyn-AHR pathway. Hypothesis: exposure to DEHP and its metabolite MEHHP upregulates the expression of Trp
transporters to increase its uptake, resulting in increased Kyn production and AHR activation leading to LM cell
survival and tumor growth. The study will link, for the first time, abnormal amino acid metabolism and LM growth,
opening a new avenue for translational research and the development of novel therapeutics for LM."
10868424,"Project Summary
Approximately 12 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with a visual impairment. These
individuals face unique challenges in our modern environment, where much critical information related to
education, employment, entertainment, and community is presented in the form of digital videos. Inaccessible
information can result in social exclusion or become life threatening if individuals require access to it in order to
make decisions related to their health and safety. For example, in a personal or global health crisis, individuals
may need to access the mass amounts of information conveyed via videos or dynamic infographics in order to
make informed decisions. To address this need, the online platform YouDescribe allows blind and low vision
(BLV) users to request amateur volunteers to create video descriptions, also referred to as audio descriptions
(AD), of YouTube videos. However, the platform has been unable to keep up with the overwhelming demand,
and 92.5% of videos on the YouDescribe user wish list remain undescribed. The overall objective of this proposal
is to build an AI-driven system, suitable for use on a wide-scale, to automatically generate descriptions of online
videos, as well as answer questions asked by BLV users about the content of videos. The rationale for this
project is that AI-based tools are necessary to facilitate timely access to the deluge of new videos appearing on
the Internet every day. The proposed work encompasses three specific aims: 1) develop an AI-based tool in
collaboration with sighted describers that more efficiently produces video descriptions and increases the
availability of accessible videos. The goal is to create an AI-driven NarrationBot that will decrease the time
required for novice volunteers to produce video descriptions by 80%; 2) develop an AI-based tool in collaboration
with BLV individuals that offers user-driven access to visual information in online videos. The goal is to develop
an AI-driven QABot that allows users to pause a video, ask questions about content, and receive immediate
answers (e.g., “What breed is the dog?”, “German shepherd”) that are accurate 80% of the time; and 3) develop
and publicly release large-scale datasets to improve machine learning for video accessibility. These novel
datasets will be used to increase the quality and accuracy of NarrationBot and QABot until AI-generated
descriptions and answers need minimal intervention from human volunteers and can serve BLV users directly.
The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on videos, whereas existing AI-driven efforts to address
this problem have focused primarily on static photos or images. It is also one of only a few efforts to directly
partner with BLV individuals to develop AI-driven systems that produce visual descriptions or answer visual
questions. The proposed research is significant because it will result in open-source, AI-driven tools that will give
BLV individuals unprecedented control over their ability to independently navigate the information-rich world of
online videos, thus improving their health and wellbeing."
10818557,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified between a handful to hundreds of risk loci
for each major type of neuropsychiatric disorders. One of the main challenges for the post-GWAS era is to
determine the causal variants and dissect the regulatory mechanism in each of the risk loci. The analysis of
causal genetic mechanisms for psychiatric diseases is confounded by the highly heterogeneous brain structures
and cell types. We hypothesize that brain regions and cell types are selectively vulnerable to mental disorders
and cell-type-specific gene regulation underlies such selectivity. In this proposed project, we aim to determine
the causal probability of individual genetic variants with high spatial resolution with respect to brain regions and
cell types. To this end, we will generate a unique dataset of single-nucleus joint profiling of chromatin
conformation and DNA methylation (sn-m3C-seq) for 10 adult brain regions, allowing the cell-type-specific
identification of regulatory elements, enhancer-gene looping and linking non-coding variants to their regulatory
target. To further identify the genetic mechanisms for cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression, we will
develop and apply cutting-edge statistical methods to existing and newly generated population single-nucleus
RNA-seq datasets for the human brain cortex and hippocampus. We will develop CONtexT spEcific geNeTics
(CONTENT) to distinguish tissue- or cell-type-specific from the tissue-shared genetic component of gene
expression regulation. We will also apply the recently developed PopuLation Allele-Specific MApping (PLASMA)
that integrates QTL and allele-specific QTL for regulatory variant fine-mapping. To validate our findings, we will
experimentally determine the function of non-coding variants using both high-throughput CRISPR interference
and precise variant replacement experiments, as well as apply orthogonal statistical approaches to link the
functional properties of variants to disease causality. Our proposed project integrates diverse approaches
including single-cell multi-omics, statistical fine-mapping, and genetic engineering and will likely provide new
insights into the genetic mechanism of mental disorders."
10773185,"Project Abstract
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing illness in which alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AW) are
associated with greater treatment failure risk and higher rates of relapse and alcohol intake. Efficacy of current
approved medications in AUD are modest, and none have been shown to be efficacious in those with AW.
Thus, there is great need to develop and evaluate treatments to address specific prognostic indicators of high
relapse and treatment failure to reduce the associated burden of AUD. Based on this previous clinical
research, we hypothesized that in AUD patients with AW (AUD+AW), PR (16 mg/day) compared to PBO will
significantly improve alcohol use outcomes, craving and also reduce associated anxiety and depression
symptoms and improve physical health (SBP and liver enzymes) functioning and patient-related outcomes
during the course of the trial and with enduring effects during over a 3 month follow up period, thereby
validating AW as a prognostic indicator both of Prazosin efficacy and in AUD treatment outcome. A 12-week
Phase II, single site, randomized clinical trial of Prazosin (PR: 16 mg/day, t.i.d dosing) is proposed in 150
treatment seeking men and women with AUD+ AW (3 or more symptoms) to address the following specific
aims: Aim #1: To evaluate the effects of PR vs PBO on the primary alcohol use outcome of percent of
subjects with no heavy drinking day (PSNHDD) and secondary drinking outcomes of %heavy drinking day
(HDD%), any drinking day (DD%) and average drinks/day (AvgD) in AUD+AW patients. Aim #2: To assess the
effects of PR vs PBO on other secondary stress-related outcomes of alcohol craving, depression and anxiety
symptoms during the trial. Aim #3: To assess enduring short-term treatment effects of PR versus PBO on
primary and other secondary outcomes at 1- and 3- month post-treatment follow-up time points. Exploratory Aim
1: To assess the effects of PR vs PBO treatment during the trial and at follow up on secondary physical health
(SBP/DBP and liver enzymes) and patient-reported functioning outcomes. Exploratory Aim 2: To explore
whether pre-treatment patient characteristics (gender, adversity/trauma history and lifetime PTSD) influence
Prazosin effects on primary and secondary alcohol use and related outcomes. Prazosin is a commonly
prescribed medication that most clinicians feel comfortable using. If successful, findings will provide important
efficacy data on Prazosin’s role in AUD+AW treatment and in related secondary psychological and physical
health outcomes. It will further validate AW at outpatient treatment entry as a prognostic indicator for AUD
treatment and for Prazosin use among AUD+AW subgroup of patients. It will also support development of the
precision medicine goal of providing specific treatment options for AUD patients with AW and stress-related
pathophysiology to improve their AUD treatment outcomes."
10788446,"Project Summary/Abstract: Adolescent alcohol use is a known risk factor for the development
of alcohol use disorders (AUDs); latent maladaptive plasticity associated with adolescent use
likely underlies this increased risk in adults. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a
sexually dimorphic brain region and critically involved in stress and negative affect-associated
relapse in AUDs, and therefore is a prime target for this maladaptive plasticity. Using a model of
adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) in male and female mice, we find disrupted
BNST glutamatergic transmission and plasticity, but the mechanisms differ across sex (GluN2B-
NMDAR-mediated in males and mGluR1/5-mediated in females). When tested during
adulthood, both forms of BNST plasticity return to control levels but exposure to restraint stress
produced a re-emergence of AIE-induced that were sex-specific. AIE also increased glutamate
release in the BNST and this effect appears be mitigated through modulation of presynaptic
CRFR1. AIE and adult stress also produce sex-specific negative affect behavioral phenotypes
(novelty-induced hypophagia test in females, foot shock-induce freezing in males). As the BNST
sits at the intersection between cortical inputs and downstream amygdalar and hypothalamic
targets, this enhanced drive to the BNST and subsequent inter BNST plasticity likely sensitize
the stress response and the expression of negative affect behaviors. Using a combination of
molecular, electrophysiological, genetic, and behavioral approaches, we will evaluate the ability
of AIE to prime the BNST to adult stress sex-specific manner. I hypothesize that that AIE and
adult stress act to synergistically enhance glutamate release in the BNST via activation of
CRFR1 in male mice but not female mice (Aim 1). Modulation of CRFR1 transmission will be
examined for its ability to block the effects of stress on glutamate release and plasticity and
evaluate stress sensitive inputs. Next, I propose that the sex difference in BNST plasticity occur
in distinct projection regions (CeA, LH, or VTA). Finally, BNST-specific deletion, BNST
DREADD activation, and pharmacological antagonism of GluN2B-NMDARs and mGluR5s
(depending on the sex) will be used to assess the role of these receptors in the development of
sex-specific negative affect phenotypes. The goal of this work is to identify potential
pharmacotherapies to treat AUDs and our work suggest that these likely need to be distinct for
males and females."

The main goal of our proposal is to investigate the role of astrocytes in the dorsal striatum (DS), which
regulates goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking behaviors in mice. The DS has a critical role in
shaping goal-directed and habitual actions, which are the main determinants for the reward-dependent
decision-making process. Astrocytic processes in close proximity to the synaptic milieu clear glutamate,
which protects neurons from excitotoxicity. Our recent studies revealed that chemogenetic activation of
dorsomedial striatum (DMS) astrocyte enhances the activities of indirect medium spiny neurons (iMSNs),
but not dMSNs in the DMS. The DMS is known to regulate goal-directed actions as lesions or inactivation
of DMS render actions habitual instead of goal-directed. Conversely, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is
necessary for habitual actions as lesions or temporary inactivation of DLS bias behavior towards goal-
directed actions. Since GABAergic iMSNs project to external globus pallidus (GPe), we also examined the
role of astrocyte in the GPe. Interestingly, both chemogenetic astrocyte activation of DMS and GPe
promotes transition from habitual to goal-directed ethanol-seeking behaviors. However, the precise role of
astrocytes in the DMS-GPe or DLS-GPe circuits in regulating habitual ethanol seeking behavior has not
been explored. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that astrocyte activities differentially regulate MSNs
activities in the DMS and DLS, thereby determine goal-directed and habitual ethanol-seeking behaviors. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose three aims. First, we will determine how activation of astrocyte
activities differentially regulates the alcohol-induced changes in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling of
the DMS and DLS. Second, we plan to examine the role of DMS and DLS astrocyte activation in goal-
directed or habitual ethanol-seeking behaviors. Finally, we will investigate the effect of ablation of DMS-
GPe and DLS-GPe circuits in goal-directed or habitual ethanol-seeking behaviors. Our study will elucidate
the neural mechanisms encoding goal-directed and habitual ethanol-containing reward-seeking behaviors.
We will provide a rational path for the development of new therapeutic methods for the treatment of AUD."

Iron is vital for many physiological processes, but excessive iron causes toxicity. Dysregulated iron homeostasis
(either iron deficiency or overload) is a harbinger of pathological conditions. The liver stores iron in hepatocytes
and is the major organ that controls systemic iron homeostasis. Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), is highly lethal with limited treatment options and no biomarkers to predict therapy response. Leukemia
inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) is frequently downregulated in human HCC; however, in vivo and genetic studies
of LIFR’s functions in liver cancer development and therapy response were lacking. Recently, by constructing
and characterizing hepatocyte-specific and inducible Lifr-knockout mice, we found that loss of Lifr promoted liver
tumorigenesis and conferred resistance to sorafenib-induced ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic type of cell death
characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides. Our data also pointed to a role for
LIFR in inhibiting NF-κB signaling in the liver, which in turn downregulates lipocalin 2 (LCN2), an iron-
sequestering cytokine. In parallel, our data revealed that in oncogene-induced liver tumors, overexpression of
LIFR increased, while knockout of Lifr decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration, which may be mediated by LCN2-
dependent downregulation of iron levels, viability, and proliferation of T cells. Altogether, these data support a
hypothesis that loss or downregulation of LIFR in liver cancer leads to upregulation of LCN2, which on one hand
confers resistance to ferroptosis on liver tumor cells, and on the other hand, deprives T cells of iron that is
essential for T cell viability, proliferation, and effector function; both mechanisms contribute to liver cancer
progression and therapy resistance. In the proposed work, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
LIFR inhibits NF-κB signaling in liver cells (Specific Aim 1). Further, we will investigate whether LCN2 can serve
as a therapeutic target for enhancing sorafenib efficacy in HCC (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will study whether
LIFR or therapeutic LCN2 neutralization can sensitize HCC to immunotherapy (Specific Aim 3). Genetically
engineered mouse models, Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated oncogene-induced liver cancer models, and
HCC patient-derived xenograft models will be used to study the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action
of two novel drug combinations, which will illuminate how to improve liver cancer therapy by targeting an iron-
sequestering pathway. We envision that low LIFR expression and high LCN2 expression could be used to select
HCC patients who will likely benefit from the combination therapy with the LCN2-neutralizing antibody plus
sorafenib or immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are integral membrane proteins that selectively conduct Na+ ions across
cell membranes. They are associated with cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric disorders and are the
molecular targets of widely used antiarrhythmic, anticonvulsant drugs. The human Nav1.5 channel generates
cardiac action potentials and is associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. The atomic structure of Navs was
first obtained from a prokaryotic NavAb channel in 2011, and then more eukaryotic Nav structures were solved
by cryo-EM in recent years, including the human cardiac Nav1.5 channel. Both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic
Nav channels are very similar in structure, including their selectivity filters, ion permeation pores, voltage
sensors, and pharmacological profiles. Most recently, the resting and activating conformations of NavAb
channels were obtained by combining the function-dependent cross-linking and cryo-EM, which provided basic
molecular frameworks to further investigate the mechanisms of voltage gating and drug modulation. My project
aims to reveal dynamic behaviors of the selectivity filter pores and voltage sensors in NavAb and Nav1.5
channels and the effects of permeant/blocking ions, gating voltages, and drug molecules on them. We will
implement the cutting-edge single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) approach to
achieve these proposed studies. Specifically, we will use both the model NavAb and human Nav1.5 channels
to (a) uncover the conformational flexibilities and dynamics of the Na selectivity filter and elucidate how it can
selectively conduct Na+ over cations such as K+ and Ca2+; (b) define the roles of selectivity filters in slow
inactivation, and understand how antiarrhythmic drugs like lidocaine and flecainide alter them to inhibit channel
function; (c) reveal the real time conformational transitions and dynamics of the voltage sensor and channel
gate in NavAb and Nav1.5 channels that is directly driven by the electrical potential to elucidate the mechanism
underlying voltage sensing and gating. We have obtained very exciting preliminary data on the NavAb channel,
which strongly justified the significance and feasibility of the proposed studies. In the resubmission, we further
made the key technical advances by establishing the unnatural amino acid incorporation method, which allows
us to label the human Nav1.5 channel with fluorophores for smFRET studies. With the Nav1.5 channel, we will
validate the key findings made on the NavAb channel and reveal the dynamic properties that are unique for
eukaryotic Navs. My studies will provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the ion selectivity, voltage
gating, and drug modulation of Nav channels, which will have broad implications on other channels and
transporters by providing both conceptual advances and novel methodologies."

We study neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve tumors characteristic of patients with the common dominantly
inherited disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). In the 30-year history of this project we have developed cell
and animal models and studied many of the cell types that are recruited to neurofibromas: neurofibroma cells
include Schwann cells (SC), which we now know are outnumbered by a combination of fibroblasts,
macrophages, and other immune cells. We use a neurofibroma mouse model in which, in the peripheral nervous
system, biallelic Nf1 mutations are present only in Schwann cell precursors (SCP) and Schwann cells; other wild
type stromal and immune cells are recruited to neurofibromas as they form. We showed that neurofibroma SC
and SCP express CXCL10, whose receptor, CXCR3, is expressed on immune cells-- T cells and dendritic cells
(DC)-- and that CXCR3 is required for neurofibroma formation. Further, we observed a strong interferon
signature in SC and neurofibroma macrophages; interferons are known to stimulate the production of CXCL10
and of CXCL9, chemokines that signal through CXCR3. Our striking Preliminary Data show that neurofibromas
require T cells to form, that transfer of T cells back to mice lacking them is sufficient to promote neurofibromas.
Mice deficient in a key type of APC, dendritic cells (DCs), also show reduced neurofibroma numbers. Finally,
immune cells are known to secrete factors that influence appear to promote Nf1-/- SCP self-renewal and
neurofibroma formation. Based on these observations we propose that: (i) Schwann cells/SCP require type I IFN
signaling to produce CXCL10 to recruit DCs and T cells. (ii) subset(s) of DCs stimulate tumor-specific T cells to
produce IFN-g, which induces Cxcl9 expression by macrophages. (iii) Cxcl9/10 act redundantly to sustain T cell
recruitment; and (iv) cytokines produced by immune cells themselves promote SC de-differentiation and
neurofibroma development, in a feed-forward loop."

This proposal harnesses statistical theory and applications underlying mechanistic models to
study mediation pathways involving high-dimensional omics markers on the children growth and

improve the understanding of mechanistic effects of environmental perturbations and
socioeconomic stressors on biological processes related to children’s health outcomes such as
adolescent obesity, cognitive function, and sexual maturation. This project is the first to
systematically study the foundation of an emerging best-subset statistical estimation and
inference in high-dimensional structural equation models (SEMs), and the resulting analytic
toolboxes allow practitioners to simultaneously cluster, estimate, and validate key mediation
pathways of clinical importance. (i) We develop a new analytic paradigm that can jointly
process a large number of mediators (e.g. metabolites or DNA methylation CpG sites) to unveil
mechanistic mediation pathways with well-controlled false discovery rate. The methodology
innovation lies in a simultaneous operation of high-dimensional pathway clustering, parameter
estimation and inference in the high-dimensional SEMs with little estimation bias and no
compromise on false discovery. (ii) We develop an adaptive hypothesis testing methodology in
high-dimensional SEMs to perform statistical inference for mediation pathways with a proper
type I error control. This new method is deemed for significant power improvement over existing
methods. (iii) We investigate mediation effects of the maternal blood lipidome and DNA
methylation markers for the relationship of gestational environmental and socioeconomic
exposures on children’s health outcomes. Moreover, discovered mechanistic mediation
pathways will help develop potential interventions for better children’s health. (iv) We develop,
test, distribute, and support freely available implementations of the proposed methods in this

Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YT2D) has emerged as one of the most important clinical and public health
consequences of the current obesity epidemic. Not only have the rates of YT2D been increasing over the
years, achieving and maintaining optimal glycemic control in this population poses unique challenges.
Furthermore, disease progression in youth is faster than in adults, with a higher risk of developing diabetes
complications earlier in the disease process than adults. Importantly, there are profound disparities in the
burden of YT2D, with racial/ethnic minorities the most at risk. Despite these facts, the pathophysiology that
leads to the development of YT2D is not well understood and even less is known about the social determinants
of health (SDOH) associated with YT2D risk. Given that SDOH are major drivers of disease among
racial/ethnic minorities, there is a critical need to assess the intersection of SDOH and biological factors in
shaping the risk of developing YT2D. In response to RFA-DK-21-002, we propose to establish a cohort of
children at risk of YT2D by recruiting from the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center (CHAM)
pediatric primary care practices (the largest provider of children’s health services in the Bronx). The Bronx is
one of the most racially and ethnically diverse counties in the country; children in the Bronx have a high burden
of obesity-related metabolic disorders and of social and economic adversities (e.g. food insecurity). Thus, our
site is very well positioned to contribute to a better understanding of the factors that lead to inequities in YT2D
risk and to inform development of more effective prevention and glycemic control strategies. Our overall
objectives are to: (1) Develop more precise and clinically feasible prediction of which individuals are truly at risk
for developing YT2D, by assessing the combined impact of metabolic and lifestyle factors, socio-economic
status (SES), sociocultural factors, and other SDoH; (2) Increase understanding of the physiologic drivers of
YT2D; (3) Provide a platform and supportive infrastructure for in-depth ancillary studies on critical aspects
related to YT2D using cohort data and banked specimens"

Despite the prevalence of SWI/SNF mutations, the contributions of these alterations to tumorigenesis remain
unclear. SMARCB1, a core subunit of the complex, was the first subunit linked to cancer when it was found to
be recurrently mutated in almost all cases of malignant rhabdoid tumors (RT). While studies using genetically
engineered mouse models have firmly established SMARCB1 as a tumor suppressor, the epigenetic mechanism
by which SMARCB1 mutation drives tumorigenesis remains elusive. The central hypothesis is that the
biochemical diversity of the SWI/SNF complex composition determines its function in proper chromatin targeting
to maintain discrete chromatin landscapes and transcriptional programs. Mutation of SMARCB1 leads to
aberrant intra- and inter-complex protein-protein interactions that influence chromatin targeting, which
consequently alters chromatin landscapes and higher-order structures, and promote an oncogenic epigenome
and transcriptome. The objective is to determine the role of SMARCB1 in SWI/SNF subcomplex formation and
the impact of these dynamics on chromatin targeting and higher-order chromatin structure. Our ultimate goal is
to determine the fundamental epigenetic mechanism(s) by which loss of this chromatin regulatory subunit drives
rhabdoid tumor development. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of cutting edge biochemical,
molecular, and high-throughput sequencing technologies to move forward the program through the following
specific aims: Aim 1, Determine SMARCB1 regulated SWI/SNF subcomplex assembly dynamics and identify
SWI/SNF interactome in rhabdoid tumors; Aim 2, Determine the chromatin targeting activities of SWI/SNF
subcomplexes and their relationship with other epigenetic regulators in rhabdoid tumors; Aim 3, Define higher-
order chromatin structures regulated by the SWI/SNF complex in rhabdoid tumors."

The overall objective of the proposed project is to investigate brain mechanisms during learning in individuals
with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with and without clinical depression. Such knowledge can help guide rehabilita-
tion strategies and reduce the burden of TBI. Feedback about the accuracy of one’s actions can improve learn-
ing by informing individuals whether their action is correct or not. Individuals with depression have been shown
to have learning deficits and altered brain activity during learning compared to healthy individuals when feed-
back is presented immediately. Impaired learning through immediate feedback has also been observed in Par-
kinson’s disease (PD) patients. However, PD patients are able to learn from feedback when it is presented af-
ter a delay through engagement of separate neural mechanisms. We show that individuals with TBI exhibit def-
icits in learning through immediate feedback that are likely exacerbated by depressive symptoms. Deficits in
learning through immediate feedback can lead to perseveration of incorrect actions and decreased strategy
use during rehabilitation. However, there is no evidence directly examining the neural mechanisms of learning
in individuals with TBI with and without depression. The proposed research fills this gap. The identification of
the neural mechanisms associated with learning in individuals with TBI with and without clinical depression will
inform 1) scientific knowledge about the effect of depression on the injured brain, 2) TBI interventions about the
effectiveness of feedback and its timing, and 3) the development of generalized interventions for other clinical
populations that require rehabilitation and have high occurrence of depression. These objectives lie at the
heart of the mission of the NINDS as they will broaden “fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous
system” associated with learning in TBI. The knowledge gained from fulfilling the above objectives will “reduce
the burden” of learning deficits after TBI. To test our hypotheses, TBI participants will be recruited based on
structured clinical interview. Qualified participants will perform an experiment where they study word pairs out-
side of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Then, in the MRI, participants will see word
pairs in multiple-choice format, along with novel distractors, and select the correct paired-associate. After each
choice, feedback will be experimentally manipulated to be presented either immediately or after a 25-minute
delay. During the final phase outside of the MRI, participants complete a second diagnostic paired-associate
multiple-choice assessment to evaluate the influence of immediate vs. delayed feedback on learning. We hy-
pothesize that depressed individuals with TBI will show improvements in learning from delayed compared to
immediate feedback. This learning dissociation will occur because learning through delayed feedback relies on
neurocircuitry that is not negatively affected by TBI and depression. Non-depressed individuals without TBI
and clinically depressed individuals without TBI will also be recruited to differentiate the influences of depres-
sion from the impact of TBI on the brain."

 Fracture is the leading musculoskeletal injury affecting over 9.4 million Americans annually. Approximately
~10% of fractures are complicated by delayed healing or non-union, resulting chronic pain, impaired mobility and
poor quality of life. Pathophysiological and habitual risk factors, including fracture site instability, concurrent
diseases (e.g., diabetes), chronic exposure to certain medications (e.g., glucocorticoids or GCs) and
tobacco/alcohol use are also major contributing causes, which may interfere with the fracture healing biology
and lead to delayed healing or non-union. GCs are widely used in treating hospitalized COVID patients. Given
the scale of the current pandemic and the significant COVID infection rate among the US population, a post
pandemic surge of fracture risk and delayed fracture healing cases may be anticipated. Currently, orthopaedic
surgery and autologous bone grafts are still the gold standard in clinical management of delayed fracture healing.
There are few FDA approved non-invasive therapeutic interventions for the treatment of GC-induced delayed
fracture healing. To address this significant unmet clinical need, we have developed a N-(2-
hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA)-based water-soluble thermoresponsive polymeric prodrug (P-TAN) of
Tanshinone IIA (TAN, a potent bone anabolic agent). The aqueous solution of P-TAN is free-flowing at room
temperature and transitions into a hydrogel (ProGel-TAN) at ≥ 27°C, which provide a unique mechanism for
sustained local delivery of TAN. When tested in a prednisone-induced delayed fracture healing mouse model,
two consecutive monthly ProGel-TAN treatments were found to accelerate the fracture healing by 5 weeks
without any side effects observed. The biomechanical properties of the bone were also fully restored. While
two monthly ProGel-TAN treatment seems to be very promising, the current orthopaedic practice favors a single
dose treatment at the time of the fracture stabilization procedure for pragmatic reasons as well as less infection
risk. Therefore, we hypothesize that with further structural and formulation optimization, we will be able to identify
an optimized single dose ProGel-TAN formulation that is highly effective and safe in treating the GC-induced
delayed fracture union. To test this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims in this project: 1. To characterize
the impact of different structural and formulation parameters of ProGel-TAN; 2. To identify single dose ProGel-
TAN formulations that provide optimal fracture healing efficacy; 3. To understand ProGel-TAN’s unique
pharmacology and putative mechanisms of action. At the successful completion of the proposed research, we
anticipate the identification of at least one optimal ProGel-TAN formulation that would satisfy the demand for a
single dose treatment to accelerate the healing of the GC-induced delayed fracture union by ~ 5 weeks and
normalize biomechanical properties of the injured bone in mice. It will then be subjected to further pre-clinical
studies on large animal models in preparation for clinical translation."

Endothelial cells regulate a wide variety of vascular functions, including contractility, which modulates organ
blood flow and systemic blood pressure. A hallmark of virtually all cardiovascular diseases is dysfunctional
endothelial cells, but pathological mechanisms involved are uncertain. Several cation channels are expressed
in ECs that modulate arterial contractility, including small- (SK) and intermediate (IK)-conductance calcium
(Ca2+)-activated potassium channels and transient receptor potential channels, including TRPV4. In contrast,
physiological functions of anion channels in ECs are poorly understood. ECs express TMEM16A, a Ca2+-
activated Cl- channel, but whether this anion channel regulates arterial contractility is unclear. Similarly
uncertain is the pathological involvement of endothelial cell TMEM16A channels in the vascular dysfunction
that occurs during hypertension. Using a broad range of approaches, including tamoxifen-inducible endothelial
cell-specific knockout mice, we provide evidence that vasodilator stimuli activate TMEM16A channels in
endothelial cells to induce vasodilation. Preliminary data also suggest that endothelial cell TMEM16A channels
are dysfunctional during hypertension. In this proposal, we will investigate three specific aims. Aim 1 will
investigate the signaling mechanisms by which physiological vasodilators activate TMEM16A channels in ECs
to induce vasorelaxation. Aim 2 will examine the mechanisms by which the activation of TMEM16A channels in
endothelial cells elicits vasodilation. Aim 3 will study the hypothesis that hypertension is associated with
pathological alterations in TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells which inhibits vasodilation by these proteins.
Methods used will include molecular biology and biochemistry techniques, super-resolution
immunofluorescence microscopy, high-speed dual-inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (diSPIM),
two-photon confocal microscopy, patch-clamp and conventional electrophysiology, arterial myography and
radiotelemetry. This project will provide significant novel information regarding physiological and pathological
vasoregulation by TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells."

 Since its outbreak in China in December 2019, the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection
has been extraordinary, with over 350 million cases and more than 5.5 million lives lost (WHO
Coronavirus Dashboard, Jan 2022). Despite various public health measures, such as social
distancing, handwashing, face masking, and vaccination, infections in the US and the world
continue in waves driven by new variants of concern (WHO). While the pandemic landscape
has been constantly shifting, epidemiologists and public health experts increasingly project that
the virus could eventually become endemic, especially with emerging zoological reservoirs.
While information is still emerging, the full picture of neurological consequences of COVID-19 to
broad sensory functions remains unclear, especially in the context of new variants, vaccination,
prior infection, and ongoing treatment. For example, smell loss has been a hallmark symptom of
COVID-19 (>80%) and can present in isolation (the only symptom of COVID-19) or precede the
occurrence of other symptoms. Epidemiology studies have shown that smell loss is the most
predictive symptom for COVID-19, better in identifying COVID-19 patients than cough, fever,
headache, or other typical symptoms used to screen for COVID-19 in workplaces, schools, and
health care settings. But with the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants and vaccination, it is
unclear whether olfaction function is still severely impacted as in the early stage of the
pandemic. Similarly, taste and chemesthesis (trigeminal) losses have been implicated but not
fully differentiated from the flavor loss caused by retronasal smell losses. Sudden onset of
hearing loss and dizziness have also been self-reported among COVID-19 patients, but current
evidence for these are still limited, despite being in the 3rd year of the pandemic. In this study,
Aim 1 will apply multidisciplinary methodologies to extensively capture and quantify the full
impact of COVID-19 on broad sensory functions (smell, taste, chemesthesis, hearing,
balance/vestibular function), with endemic viral upper respiratory infection (URI: cold, flu, etc.)
as a comparison group. These tests will allow us to extensively explore and differentiate the
impact of COVID-19 on multiple sensory functions and their association with the disease profile,
such as severity, dominant variant at the time of infection, vaccination status, prior infections,
and treatment received, with potential to characterize common and distinct factors to that of
URI. Aim 2 will broadly assess the longitudinal time course of sensory loss and recovery among
COVID-19 patients, with the expectation that recovery can vary depending on the system
affected and the disease profile. Aim 3 will specifically focus on COVID-19 “long haulers”,
patients who have persistent symptoms (>90 days), to examine the different characteristics in
sensory losses and recovery during the prolonged disease phase. The outcomes of this study
could importantly expand our understanding of the characteristics of broad sensory losses and
their recovery among COVID-19 patients."

 This proposal will develop Bayesian machine learning approaches via Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP) to handle
nonignorable missingness (in outcomes and covariates) and conduct causal inference for electronic health records
(EHRs), to address missingness in multivariate longitudinal data, and for causal mediation problems. Missing
data remains a problem in clinical studies and in particular, for studies using EHRs. In clinical studies, more
e↵ort is spent to try to minimize the amount of missingness, but it still remains a problem and missingness is
a constant issue (and less controllable) in studies based on EHRs. In addition, there has been limited work on
the use of auxiliary information in EHRs that can enhance the ability to deal with missing data. Approaches for
missingness in multivariate longitudinal data is underdeveloped and relevant across many clinical trials settings
from cost e↵ectiveness analysis to incomplete time-varying auxiliary covariates (or confounders) to causal mediation
to multiple outcomes of interest. The mechanisms of treatment e↵ectiveness are of particular interest in behavioral
trials. Speciﬁcally, how do di↵erent processes mediate the e↵ect of an intervention? This can facilitate constructing
future interventions. However, determining the causal e↵ect of such 'mediators' on outcomes is di""cult. We will
develop new approaches to identify these e↵ects in the complex setting of cluster randomized trials for which
little work has been done. For all these settings, a Bayesian approach is ideal as it allows one to appropriately
characterize uncertainty about unveriﬁable assumptions (which are present in all these problems) and allows the
ﬂexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. MCMC algorithms for BNP can sometimes converge slowly and can
be untenable for large n. We will extend existing approaches to address both these complications which will be
important for all the applications considered and in general, given the increasing size and complexity of data.
 The methods are motivated by several NHLBI funded studies, whose PI's are co-investigators on this proposal,
and will be developed to help answer numerous important clinical questions including the mechanisms of behavior
change in weight management and the impact of linkage (and engagement) to care on treatment e↵ectiveness
for blood pressure outcomes. The methods will also help us evaluate potentially synergistic e↵ects when drugs
with potential diabetogenic e↵ects are used concomitantly and whether the impact on cancer outcomes varies by
di↵erent bariatric surgeries.
 The history of the the collaborations among the entire study team will help produce the best science and
facilitate dissemination of our methodological and clinical ﬁndings. We will disseminate code for these methods
(via the PI's github page and software papers) to ensure the methods will be readily usable by investigators
involved in cardiovascular, obesity, diabetes, and cancer studies."
10763875,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of death among American men. Nearly all of these deaths are due to the
evolution of therapy resistance and metastatic spread. As such, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop new agents
to treat therapy-resistant, metastatic PCa. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Second Chromosome Locus Associated
with Prostate 1 (SChLAP1) has been identified as the top RNA associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality and
metastasis from multiple datasets with long-term follow up. Knockdown/overexpression of SChLAP1 is associated
with changes to pro-metastatic phenotypes, such as invasion and colony formation. Targeting this critical cellular
regulator has been elusive, however, and its mechanism of action in promoting PCa therapy resistance and metastasis
has not been fully elucidated. For example, an interaction between SChLAP1 and the SWI/SNF complex has been
implicated in PCa progression in some studies, but not in others. This gap in knowledge regarding the molecular
function of SChLAP1 prevents effective therapeutic targeting of SChLAP1. Recent work by our team and others has
revealed a complex RNA architecture within SChLAP1 as well as protein binding regions localized to highly structured
and primate-conserved regions of the transcript. This compelling evidence for functional RNA structures, combined
with the availability of SChLAP1 as a biomarker in urine and blood, renders targeting of lncRNA SChLAP1 a promising
precision medicine-based treatment approach for men with aggressive PCa.
 The overall objectives of the proposed work are to: 1) identify and characterize protein interactors and
chromatin-binding sites critical to SChLAP1 oncogenic activity and 2) validate drug-like ligands identified in recent
screens as tool molecules for targeting structured regions of SChLAP1, including inhibition of these interactions and
SChLAP1-driven phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism of SChLAP1 involves interactions with
both protein and chromatin, and that targeting these interactions will inhibit SChLAP1-driven phenotypes and reveal
novel therapeutic avenues to treat metastatic, treatment-resistant PCa. In Aim 1, unbiased sequencing and mass
spectrometry-based approaches will identify chromatin regions and proteins bound by SChLAP1 in cells, and these
interactions will be interrogated in an array of phenotypic assays to evaluate their role in proliferation, cancer cell
survival, migration/invasion, and resistance to standard-of-care hormone therapy. In Aim 2, ligands of conserved
SChLAP1 substructures will be validated in phenotypic assays, and their effects on molecular interactions will be
interrogated. Expected outcomes of this work will be as follows: 1) comprehensive biological insight into targetable
intermolecular interactions for SChLAP1 and 2) identification of small molecules that inhibit SChLAP1:protein
interactions and subsequent phenotypes in PCa. This work will set the stage for a future R01 proposal focused on in
vivo validation studies for small molecules targeting SChLAP1 and the development of an exosome-based liquid
biopsy for SChLAP1, with the ultimate goal of yielding a precision medicine-based strategy for aggressive and
treatment-resistant PCa while also helping to establish lncRNA targeting as a therapeutic paradigm in oncology."

Survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells is largely due to B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and to the
anti-apoptotic function of BCL-2 family proteins. The BCR pathway is critical for the proliferation, maintenance,
and survival of B-cells. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is pivotal in the BCR axis and is activated when BCR is
stimulated. Due to its critical role in BCR axis signaling and importance of the BCR pathway in B-cells, BTK is
an attractive therapeutic target and ibrutinib (IBR) was approved for CLL. The dependency of CLL cells on BCL-
2 protein for survival makes BCL-2 antagonists such as venetoclax (VEN) optimal combination partners for BTK
inhibitors. Acalabrutinib (ACA) is a second-generation more selective BTK inhibitor that irreversibly binds to
Cys-481 in the BTK kinase domain and potently blocks its enzymatic activity. ACA demonstrated compelling
activity in the clinic and during Phase I trials, and it became clear that this oral drug is highly effective with greater
selectivity than first-generation inhibitor IBR. However, clinically, patients rarely achieve complete remissions
(CR) or cures, and continuous use of the drug or combination strategies are needed. Similar to BCR targeting,
BCL-2 inhibitor, VEN, was effective in the clinic but with limited CRs. Based on our preclinical investigations and
three distinct rationales, we designed and initiated a clinical trial combining IBR and VEN in CLL. Rationales
included decline in MCL-1 survival protein in CLL cells following IBR treatment, mobilization of CLL cells from
lymph nodes to circulating blood after IBR, and potential decreased incidence of VEN-induced tumor lysis
syndrome due to debulking of tumor by IBR. Data demonstrated a dramatic increase in CR rates compared with
IBR or VEN monotherapy as well as achievement of undetectable measurable residual disease in 2/3 of
previously untreated patients. Based on this data we hypothesized that more selective BTK inhibitor ACA
combined with VEN may be more effective strategy for CLL with greater response rates. A clinical protocol
(NCT04169737) has been established and initiated to evaluate the efficacy of the combination treatment with or
without obinutuzumab treatment-naïve and previously treated cohorts. In this proposal, we will focus only on the
ACA+VEN combination (i.e. without obinutuzumab). Through this trial, we will obtain samples during treatment
to evaluate the components that contribute to response to therapy. In Aim 1, we will conduct pharmacodynamic
analyses during therapy to determine the impact of VEN addition to ACA. Plasma pharmacokinetics of each
drug will be measured, and molecular endpoints will be compared using RNAseq and proteomics analyses. For
Aim 2, we will compare the combination of ACA/VEN combination against IBR/VEN for non-inferiority. These
analyses will include pharmacodynamic analysis, -omics and biomarker comparisons using retrospective data
from IBR/VEN combination with the ongoing ACA/VEN clinical trial. We have prior data from untreated (n=120)
and previously treated (n=80) CLL patients on IBR/VEN trial. Ultimately, the goals of this proposal are to identify
hallmarks and biomarkers of response and resistance that may lead to more effective treatment of CLL."

Few risk-eligible women agree to standard endocrine interventions for breast cancer risk reduction due to fear
of side effects combined with incomplete efficacy and lack of a reliable marker of response. Worry about
initiation or worsening vasomotor symptoms is a common barrier. The Tissue Selective Estrogen Complex of
bazedoxifene (BZA) 20 mg and conjugated estrogen (CE) 0.45 mg marketed as Duavee® is FDA-approved for
relief of hot flashes and prevention of osteoporosis. Duavee® is promising for breast cancer risk reduction
given the estrogen antagonist effects in the breast and uterus, and estrogen agonist properties in bone. The
bazedoxifene component does not antagonize CE's favorable effects on vasomotor symptoms despite anti-
tumor efficacy observed for the combination. In our pilot, 6 months of Duavee® given to symptomatic women
at increased risk for breast cancer alleviated hot flashes and favorably modulated risk biomarkers of
mammographic fibroglandular volume (Volpara™ fully automated assessments), benign breast tissue
proliferation (Ki-67), and serum progesterone, IGF-1, and bioavailable testosterone. A phase IIB multi-
institutional trial of 6 months of Duavee® vs placebo is proposed in high-risk women with vasomotor
symptoms. Blood, mammogram, and benign breast tissue, and anthropomorphic and quality of life measures
will be obtained at baseline. Subjects will be stratified by enrollment site, fibroglandular volume, and Ki-67; and
randomized to blinded Duavee® or matched placebo for 6 months, followed by repeat assessments. The
primary endpoint is change in mammographic fibroglandular volume. Secondary endpoints are change in
benign breast tissue Ki-67, estrogen and progesterone receptor protein, ER and PgR target gene expression
(RT-qPCR), serum IGF-1: IGFBP3, bioavailable hormones, the ratio of soluble receptor activator of nuclear
factor kappa-Β ligand (sRANKL) to osteoprotegerin, and patient reported outcome measures related to
vasomotor symptoms, quality of life, and cognition. Reverse phase protein array and RNA-seq are performed
on benign tissue to aid in elucidation of mechanisms of action. The possible influence of BZA levels, body fat,
visceral fat, insulin resistance, and inflammatory cytokines on biomarker modulation will be examined.
Favorable biomarker modulation would provide evidence that Duavee® is likely to reduce risk for breast cancer
and establish potential markers to predict response in a Phase III chemoprevention trial."

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. Overall,
survival rates for RMS are approximately 65-70%. However, despite intensification of chemotherapeutic
regimens, long-term outcomes for patients with metastatic or relapsed rhabdomyosarcoma remain extremely
poor, with overall survival rates between 20-30%. Thus, alternative targeted therapies are essential for improving
patient outcomes. Our proposal will address a significant gap in the knowledge and treatment of high-risk
rhabdomyosarcoma. RMS tumors have frequent mutations in the RAS/NF1 pathway and perturbations in the
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)/RAS/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling axis, which are associated with
high-risk conditions. The p21-activated kinases (PAK) family of serine/threonine kinases intersects the oncogenic
signaling by RTK and RAS-activated pathways. Downstream PAK signaling regulates metastatic phenotypes
and resistance to therapeutics, thus making them attractive targets for advanced cancers. Based upon extensive
informatic, functional genomic, biochemical interactome and pharmacological data we have evidence that PAK4
regulates intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, including alternative splicing(AS) and immune modulatory signals,
that contributes to RMS progression. In addition, using high-throughput combination drug screens we identified
mechanistically rational and clinically applicable synergistic therapeutic regimens with PAK4 inhibition. The
overarching goals of our proposal are to gain critical molecular insights into novel PAK4-mediated mechanisms
and further investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting PAK4 in RMS. We will examine PAK4’s role as a
novel regulator of AS and PAK4-mediated downstream transcriptomic and proteomic signatures that contribute
to RMS progression through the use of our extensive inventory of highly relevant human and syngeneic murine
pre-clinical models. We hypothesize PAK4 regulates critical intrinsic and extrinsic molecular signatures vital for
RMS progression, and PAK4 inhibitors in combination with rational targeted agents can provide effective novel
therapeutic regimens for these high-risk patients. We propose three independent, yet innovative and novel
complementary aims to address this hypothesis. Aim1. Evaluation of PAK4 as a novel splicing regulating protein
kinase and its direct effects on downstream signaling in RMS. Aim 2. Role of PAK4 in modulating the tumor
microenvironment and identification of therapeutic applications using relevant murine pre-clinical models of RMS
developed in our lab. Aim3. Investigate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting PAK4 in combination with
mechanistically rational targeted agents using innovative ex vivo 3D lung metastasis models and in vivo
orthotopic and metastatic RMS models. Completion of these studies will provide novel molecular insights into
RMS biology and impact RMS therapy by providing new therapeutic strategies that can be quickly moved towards
clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or metastatic RMS."
10817921,"Rett syndrome (RTT), is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of function mutations in the X-
linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding Protein 2 (MECP2) and characterized by loss of speech and hand skills,
problems walking, and repetitive hand movements. Genetic restoration of MECP2 in symptomatic mice can
reverse symptoms providing hope that disease-modifying therapies can be created. Impeding the development
of transformative therapies are a lack of biomarkers of treatment-response. Ideally, a biomarker can be applied
in mice and humans to enhance effective translation of preclinical treatment studies and improve human trial
design and execution. Neurophysiological assessments have potential as biomarkers as they are non-invasive,
measure neurological changes, and are translatable between humans and animal models. Recent work in RTT,
from our group, has found differences in neurophysiological measures in both affected humans and mouse
models that correlate with disease severity, but an urgent need exists to identify well-validated and translatable
treatment-response biomarkers in RTT.
 To address this need, we propose here to develop neurophysiological biomarkers that can fulfil a specific
primary Context of Use (COU), an early treatment response biomarker, to facilitate and speed both preclinical
and clinical trials of novel therapies in RTT. The primary goal of the R61 phase of the proposal is to identify
candidate neurophysiological biomarkers of disease improvement in a mouse model of RTT and establish human
multi-site standard operating procedures and normative data. These parallel projects will be foundational to
identify a true treatment responsive biomarker in RTT. To do this we will first determine if potential biomarkers,
quantitative EEG and evoked potentials will change predictively in a mouse model of RTT that allows for genetic
rescue of the RTT phenotype. Simultaneously, we will develop and optimize standard operating procedures to
enable multi-site evaluation of candidate human neurophysiological biomarkers. Additionally, we will evaluate
test-retest reliability of the biomarkers we are developing. Finally, we will determine if the putative
neurophysiological biomarkers change during active clinical change in RTT. For the R33 phase, we will
demonstrate that our human proof-of-concept of candidate neurophysiological biomarkers are stable over the
time frame relevant to clinical trials in RTT and that these biomarkers correlate with RTT clinical severity.
 Overall, this proposal takes advantage of the ability to use mouse models to identify and validate robust
human neurophysiological features as putative biomarkers. These neurophysiological measures will allow for
accelerated therapy development via the replacement of subjective clinical findings with quantitative measures
of early treatment-response. Together, this work will facilitate biomarker development to be employed in
interventional therapy development."

Maximal surgical resection of the most common primary brain cancer, glioblastoma (GBM), has been shown to
improve overall survival in a highly morbid disease. However, delineation of residual tumor at the margins of
surgical resections can be challenging using conventional techniques, and therefore the use of fluorescence
guided surgery (FGS) has emerged as an adjuvant tool for tumor detection. At present, only one agent, 5-
aminoleveulinic acid (5-ALA), is approved for detection of GBM during surgery. Metabolism of 5-ALA into
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is detected qualitatively by wide-field fluorescence imaging through the surgical
microscope. This intensity-based detection is non-quantitative and background light-sensitive, requiring the
surgeon to work in a dark field. We have developed a fiber-based pulse-excitation time-resolved method for
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) to detect quantitative PpIX fluorescence in real-time under full
illumination conditions. Our goal in this study is to integrate the point-scanning FLIm technology with an
existing intraoperative stereotactic neuronavigation system produced by BrainLab to spatially co-register FLIm
data across the surgical field for applicable surgical guidance. We aim to develop new software and tissue
classifiers based on primary patient data, and to apply the integrated technology in a prospective clinical study
to demonstrate the benefits for surgical navigation.
To achieve the overall goal of developing a new integrated technology which is immediately applicable for
routine use in brain tumor resections, we will undertake the following aims: Aim 1) To develop new software for
integration of the FLIm device with the BrainLab neuronavigation system for real-time acquisition of spatial
positioning of FLIm data and display of the data overlaid on the patient’s imaging in the navigation space. Aim
2) To develop classifiers for surgically resectable tumor based on PpIX fluorescence lifetime thresholds
determined through a prospective study correlating FLIm data to tissue biopsies. Aim 3) To validate the
accuracy of integrated FLIm-based navigation in identifying residual tumor tissue to facilitate a greater extent of
resection in a prospective clinical study."
10896140,"Prior to clinical evidence of fibrosis, microvascular injury occurs, presenting as an altered functional state of the
endothelium, increased permeability, enhanced vasoreactivity, increased expression of adhesion molecules,
excessive inflammation, and altered vascular wall growth. Microvascular rarefaction, or capillary dropout, is
coincident with chronic fibrosis, and considered an accelerator of the disease. However little is known about the
microvascular contribution to fibrotic diseases in which microvasculature are key to tissue health and
homeostasis. Given the central role of the vasculature in barrier function, inflammatory regulation and interstitial
tissue necrosis, it is likely that the microvasculature, specifically, mural perivascular cells (pericytes), are key
contributors to fibrotic development and progression. Recent evidence suggests that microvascular dysfunction
may be more directly influential to tissue remodeling than epithelial cells. Limited availability of human pericytes
from a readily available human source has led to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying
pericyte to myofibroblast transition that facilitate both microvascular and interstitial matrix remodeling. Our work,
supported by that of others in this area, has led us to the hypothesis that pericytes cease homeostatic
maintenance of the microvasculature by transition into a myofibroblast through the process of
dedifferentiation and re-differentiation known as cellular reprogramming. As myofibroblasts, cells of
pericyte lineage contribute to interstitial tissue fibrosis. Through three distinct aims we will show that, in
response to growth factor, pericytes deposit extracellular matrix proteins to alternatively support vascular stability
and fibrosis as they undergo phenotypic transition from microvascular pericytes to interstitial myofibroblasts. We
also determine points in pericyte transition that may be key for therapeutic intervention. We utilize traditional
molecular biology methods and biomaterials technology to determine the profibrotic mediators promote
functional and phenotypic shifts in pericytes. Using 2- and 3-D bioengineered mechanically and biochemically
tunable polymer based extracellular matrices, we decouple the role of biochemical and mechanical signals in
regulation of PC to myofibroblast transition through the process of reprogramming. Results acquired through use
of human cells in bioengineered structures will be validated with animal models of pulmonary fibrosis."
10769792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The opioid crisis has driven home the need for new, non-addictive analgesics to treat both severe acute and
chronic pain. Over the past 25 years, the search for such novel analgesics has had only a few successes and
many failures. There are two drawbacks of modern analgesic screening that we aim to correct with our screening
assay. First, screening for novel analgesics typically relies on a biochemical readout that is readily amenable to
high throughput screening (HTS). While such an approach has advantages (e.g., speed), it does not account for
the complexity and heterogeneity of nociceptor sensory neuron biology. Second, many new analgesic targets
and efficacy studies from HTS rely on rodent behavior and cellular physiology. For clear ethical reasons, rodent
efficacy studies have made complete sense, and yet, the differences between homo sapiens and murine
organisms have led to a failure to translate exciting preclinical targets to human pain. The mechanisms for these
failures are now being illuminated as multiple research groups, including our own, have begun to study sensory
neuron physiology and pharmacology in primary human dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Differences in expression of
“standard” nociceptor markers between mice, rats, and humans illustrate the importance of moving into human
cells as early as possible in the development of novel analgesics. In this proposal, we address both issues above
by performing screening of natural product fractions for their ability to reduce hyperexcitability in human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived nociceptors. In the past, the promise of derived nociceptors has fallen short of true
human nociceptor replication. Based on our preliminary and published data, we believe that our cells, RealDRGs,
truly are “nociceptors.” In this proposal, we will combine this abundant, replicable, and reliable source of human
“nociceptors” with cutting-edge multi-electrode array (MEA) technology to screen natural product fractions for
analgesic-like effects. Over the last several years, we have used mouse DRGs with MEAs to show proof-of-
concept (PoC) analgesic screening including documenting and validating a Z’-factor assay quality assessment
process. We will use the R61 portion to determine (1) the optimal stable baseline after plating of RealDRGs to
estimate the active electrode yield, (2) the stability in firing rate after exogenous sensitization, (3) the Z’ factor,
and (4) PoC screening of known nociceptor inhibitors. Upon reaching our quantitative milestones, we will then
progress in the R33 phase to (1) screen natural product fractions from the National Cancer Institute with (2) final
testing of subfractions in RealDRGs and in human primary DRGs."
10760262,"CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-associated genes)
loci are present in almost all archaea and half of eubacteria. They protect prokaryotes from foreign
genetic elements. While highly diverse, all CRISPR-Cas systems function through three common steps:
1) adaptation, i.e., acquisition of short foreign DNA sequences (spacers) into CRISPR arrays; 2)
production of mature protective CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and 3) interference, when Cas nucleases
guided by crRNAs destroy nucleic acids containing complementary targets. Studies of the interference
part of CRISPR response have revolutionized the field of genomic editing. The less-studied adaptation
part limits global horizontal gene transfer and can be harnessed for creation of DNA-based recording
devices and control of the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Initial CRISPR immunity is built in the
course of “naïve”, non-discriminate acquisition of short intracellular DNA molecules – prespacers - as
spacers into CRISPR arrays. It occurs very infrequently and can lead to suicidal self-interference. A
remarkable mechanism called “priming” operates in type I CRISPR-Cas systems: acquisition of spacers
from DNA with sequences matching pre-existing spacers is dramatically stimulated compared to naïve
acquisition from DNA devoid of such sequences. Primed adaptation is highly beneficial to the host: it
rapidly leads to specific acquisition of additional interference-proficient spacers from genetic parasites
and ensures that no self-targeting spacers are selected. The mechanistic relationship between
interference and adaptation during priming is not fully clear. The goal of this proposal is to dissect
interrelationships between interference and adaptation during priming and to identify cellular processes
that feed the adaptation machinery during naïve and primed adaptation. We will use FragSeq - an
innovative high-throughput approach that identifies short intracellular DNA fragments and that was
developed during the previous funding period - to determine the structure of prespacers and of other in
vivo adaptation intermediates generated during naïve and primed adaptation in diverse CRISPR-Cas
systems classes and types, and identify non-Cas cellular proteins essential for prespacer generation and
spacer acquisition. The understanding of CRISPR adaptation that will result from our work will allow us
and others to optimize the efficiency of the adaptation process, facilitating construction of strains with
desired spacer content/immunity profiles and, by revealing processes that limit adaptation, may help
control viability of bacterial populations by inducing adaptation from cell’s own DNA and self-interference."
10769765,"X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of inheritable rickets characterized by
mutations in PHEX. These mutations result in elevated serum levels of FGF23, which leads to
hypophosphatemia, rickets, and osteomalacia. FGF23 also inhibits vitamin D 1-a-hydroxylase (Cyp27b1), thus
blocking 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) production. Pathologic mineralization of the enthesis (tendon-bone
attachment site), referred to as enthesopathy, is a debilitating complication of XLH that causes significant pain
and impaired mobility in affected individuals. Common sites affected include the patellar and Achilles entheses.
The pathogenesis of XLH enthesopathy is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that Achilles
entheses from mice with XLH (Hyp) have an expansion of hypertrophic appearing cells (HECs) that exhibit an
aberrant chondrogenic phenotype with enhanced BMP/IHH signaling by P14. Treatment of Hyp mice with
1,25D or a FGF23 blocking antibody (FGF23Ab) early in development (P2) similarly prevented enthesopathy
despite the dramatic increase in FGF23 expression in bone, suggesting impaired 1,25D action underlies the
enhanced BMP/IHH signaling observed in Hyp enthesopathy. In both mice and humans with XLH, 1,25D
therapy cannot reverse enthesopathy, supporting the hypothesis that early restoration of 1,25D is needed to
prevent enthesopathy. The increase in serum 1,25D levels wane post-initiation of FGF23Ab in both mice and
humans with XLH, suggesting FGF23Ab may not be effective in preventing enthesopathy in XLH patients.
There is no data on the effects of optimized 1,25D monotherapy or FGF23Ab on enthesopathy in XLH patients.
Therefore, given the similar responses of mice and humans to 1,25D and FGF23Ab, studies on the hormonal
regulation of XLH enthesopathy are essential to guiding future clinical studies on enthesopathy prevention.
 Preliminary data show that XLH enthesopathy results from impaired 1,25D action, not actions specific
to FGF23 or consequences of the Hyp mutation. Studies in Aim I will examine mice with global deletions of
Cyp27b1, FGF23, or both with or without the Hyp mutation to address the hypothesis that impaired 1,25D
action leads to enhanced BMP/IHH signaling and enthesopathy. Studies will also elucidate if decreased local
1,25D action leads to enthesopathy. Since our data demonstrates increased BMP signaling is accompanied by
enhanced GDF5 expression in Hyp entheses, studies in Aim II will identify a pathogenic role for GDF5/BMP
signaling in Hyp enthesopathy development. Studies will determine the time course of GDF5 expression in WT
and Hyp entheses. Ablation of GDF5 in Hyp entheses will define the role of GDF5 in the activation of BMP/IHH
signaling in XLH enthesopathy. Inhibition of BMP signaling in Hyp mice will show that IHH signaling is activated
by BMP signaling in entheses and enhanced BMP/IHH signaling directly leads to enthesopathy. Taken
together, these studies will identify novel hormonal and molecular regulators of XLH enthesopathy and normal
enthesis development. They will also identify targets for the design of new therapies to prevent enthesopathy."
10792585,"Dissociation is a multifaceted, transdiagnostic, and disabling phenomenon that involves
detachment from the self or surroundings. It is prevalent in traumatized people with
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), occurs in other disorders including depression, anxiety,
and schizophrenia, and is a barrier to recovery in first-line treatments. Dissociation is
characterized by attentional impairments and disruptions in body awareness, or interoception.
Mindfulness-based meditative practices, including breath-focused mindfulness meditation
(BFM), are designed to enhance attentional control through focused awareness on interoceptive
cues (breath). However, this is a nearly impossible task for dissociative people, who experience
disruptions in body agency and are unable to access or trust body signals. Exteroceptive
feedback enhances interoceptive awareness and body agency in experimental studies and may
similarly enhance attentional control with minimal cognitive effort. As such, the goal of this study
is to address deficits in interoception and attentional control in dissociative traumatized patients
via BFM augmented with exteroceptive feedback. This is delivered by a unique device that
vibrates in concert with respiration, yielding non-ignorable mechanoreceptor reactivity to
breathing. Using a stimulus-driven mechanism, our device is expected to enhance body agency
and efficiently engage attention and interoception networks. We will recruit 200 traumatized
people with clinically significant dissociation symptoms, divided in four equal groups to yield a
2x2 (breath-focused meditation or rest x with or without vibroacoustic stimulation) design. All
participants will attend 8 sessions of their assigned intervention. We will administer attentional
control and interoception tasks during fMRI pre- and post-intervention to examine: Aim 1)
whether BFM with exteroceptive feedback engages attentional control and interoceptive
networks to a significantly greater degree than the other treatment conditions from pre- to post-
intervention. We will also examine: Aim 2) whether changes in neural network response
correspond with changes in dissociation (and secondarily, other trauma-related problems) to a
greater degree in BFM with exteroceptive feedback as compared to the other treatment
conditions. The immediate impact of this research is to overcome neurobiological barriers to
treatment response in dissociation using novel technology. The long-term impact will be to
inform the development of publicly-disseminable devices that can augment current
interventi ons."
10775696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical probes to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with
epigenetic-complexes and transcriptional regulation. Establishing detailed mechanisms for the dynamic
regulation of gene expression remains a significant challenge for the field of epigenetics. Our research
program is addressing these challenges by developing selective chemical probes, discovery of new protein-
protein interactions, and improving structural biology and biophysical approaches to quantify these dynamic
multivalent interactions. These approaches are helping to create a detailed picture of diverse molecular
assemblies of epigenetic complexes and facilitating development of new epigenetic therapies.
 Bromodomain-containing proteins are a subset of epigenetic reader protein, and are an emerging protein-
drug class for epigenome therapy. My research program is developing chemical biology approaches to study
two specific bromodomain-containing proteins, BPTF and BRD4. One innovation behind our approach uses a
19F NMR protein-based methodology for the discovery of isoform selective bromodomain inhibitors. Due to the
hyper-responsive nature of fluorine to ligand binding and simplified spectra, this structural biology tool is ideally
suited to rapidly screen small molecules, characterize the transient interactions associated with native
transcription factor-protein interactions, and to quantify the dynamics of the interactions from micro to
millisecond timescales. Over the next five years, we will further develop this approach for enabling small
molecule discovery, characterizing large (> 50 kDa) proteins, and quantifying the affinity and dynamics of
multidomain proteins associated with synthetic nucleosomes. With their discovery enabled by 19F NMR, our
new chemical probes for BPTF reader domains have potential for high impact as chemical tools for inhibiting
cancer progression and regulating autophagy, while more specific BRD4 chemical probes will help uncover
new biology in cancer and inflammation obscured by less specific tool compounds. We will use these tools to
dissect the functional roles of these bromodomains on transcription, including gene regulation, chromatin
engagement, and novel-protein-protein interactions. Next generation chemical probes will be further
developed including bifunctional molecules as inhibitors of multi-domain proteins, PROTACs with improved
selectivity profiles, and synthetic transcription factors through conjugation to DNA-targeting polyamides.
 This proposal has broad biomedical significance for early lead discovery and studies of epigenetic reader
domains important in human health and disease. Given that epigenetic proteins represent a major class of
potential drug targets, our new 19F NMR small molecule discovery method and cell-based approaches for
epigenetic reader domains described here could significantly increase the repertoire of targets and thereby
open up new avenues for drug discovery."
10789861,"Summary
 Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), an autoimmune exocrinopathy of the salivary and lacrimal glands, affects ~ 4
million Americans, 90% of whom are women. SS is characterized by sialadenitis and dacryoadenitis,
decreased saliva (i.e., xerostomia) and tear production (i.e., xerophthalmia) and the presence in blood serum
of autoantibodies against Ro/SSA and La/SSB. Xerostomia and xerophthalmia in SS patients can lead to
periodontitis, yeast and bacterial infections, digestive disorders and vision deterioration that severely reduce
the quality of life for patients. Ultimately, chronic inflammation in SS leads to secondary autoimmune diseases,
tissue fibrosis and lymphoma. Therapy for SS is limited to symptom management through external hydration,
artificial saliva and tears and muscarinic receptor agonists that induce fluid secretion from residual exocrine
acinar cells. Such remedies are universally judged to be inadequate and thus, development of more effective
SS treatments is essential. Our research focuses on cell surface P2X7 and P2Y2 receptors for extracellular
ATP, the intracellular chemical form of energy that when released from damaged salivary glands initiate
inflammatory responses. Our studies show that P2X7R and P2Y2R antagonists enhance saliva secretion and
reduce lymphocytic foci in salivary glands of two different mouse models of SS. Antagonism of the P2X7R also
reduces lymphocytic accumulation in the lacrimal glands and increases tear secretion. These antagonists have
not been used to treat human SS, although P2X7R is upregulated in salivary glands of SS patients compared
to non-SS controls. P2X7R activation in salivary glands also induces maturation and release of IL-1β, an SS-
related cytokine that upregulates P2Y2R in immune and epithelial cells, suggesting that P2X7R and P2Y2R
contribute together to SS development. This project will investigate the ability of P2X7R and/or P2Y2R
antagonists to increase saliva and/or tear secretion and reduce sialadenitis and/or dacryoadenitis in mouse
models of SS. These findings will be validated by assessing P2X7R and P2Y2R expression in archived human
SS and control minor salivary gland biopsies and evaluating effects of P2X7R and/or P2Y2R antagonism in
freshly isolated human salivary and lacrimal gland cells. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the hypothesis that
P2X7R and P2Y2R play sequential roles in chronic sialadenitis and glandular dysfunction in SS mouse models
and can be antagonized to treat SS in vivo. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the hypothesis that P2X7R and
P2Y2R activation in lacrimal gland epithelial cells promotes dry eye disease in mouse models of SS. Specific
Aim 3 will investigate P2X7R and P2Y2R-mediated proinflammatory responses in human primary salivary and
lacrimal gland cells and human SS minor salivary gland biopsies. Successful completion of this proposal will
represent a critical step towards realization of the ultimate goal of targeting the P2X7R and/or P2Y2R to treat
SS in humans."

The long-term goal of this grant is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the intercellular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of organismal heme homeostasis. In mammals, heme, an iron-containing cofactor and signaling molecule, is synthesized in all nucleated cells and is essential for a diverse array of fundamental biological processes. As a hydrophobic and cytotoxic molecule, heme must be transported in a highly controlled manner through membranes via specific cellular pathways. The current paradigm posits that mammalian cellular heme homeostasis is maintained solely by the balance between heme biosynthesis, driven by 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS), and heme degradation. While the discovery of eukaryotic heme transporters has given rise to the emerging notion that inter- and intra-cellular heme trafficking pathways also contribute to the maintenance of heme homeostasis, the pathways and mechanisms that mediate heme homeostasis outside of the context of heme biosynthesis and heme degradation remain poorly understood. Our recent unpublished studies using a newly generated hepatocyte-specific ALAS knockout mouse model (Alas1/2KO mice) strongly suggest that hepatocytes acquire “on demand” heme from reticuloendothelial macrophages through a currently unexplored intercellular heme homeostatic pathway. In this proposal, we will test our paradigm-shifting hypothesis that hepatocytes maintain cellular heme homeostasis by acquiring a substantial portion of their heme from macrophages using the Alas1/2KO mice. To this end, Specific Aim 1 will identify the cell types that are directly involved in heme transfer from macrophages to hepatocytes by establishing an in vitro primary liver cell co-culture system. Specific Aim 2 will employ in vivo approaches to identify key molecules involved in the hepatocyte heme acquisition pathway and to investigate the mechanisms by which the acquisition system is activated. Specific Aim 3 will identify additional candidate genes and pathways that drive hepatocyte heme acquisition using single cell RNA sequencing. These studies will advance our understanding of how liver maintains heme homeostasis in health and disease and may aid in improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of the life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks that occur in the acute hepatic porphyrias."
10807093,"The cell wall of many species of Lactobacillales consists of multiple peptidoglycan layers
decorated with serotype-specific polysaccharides that are characterized by the presence of
rhamnose. Streptococcus mutans is a key etiological agent of human dental caries, and has
also been implicated in bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Based on the chemical structures
of serotype-specific carbohydrates, S. mutans is classified into serotypes c, e, f and k with
approximately 70-80% of strains found in the oral cavity classified as serotype c. The serotype
c-specific carbohydrate (SCC) of S. mutans is composed of a polyrhamnose backbone with α-
linked glucose side-chains. Although carbohydrate structures have been reported for all
S. mutans serotypes, our recent insights into the structure of these glycopolymers indicate that
the functionally important modification, glycerol phosphate, was overlooked, possibly due to its
loss during the purification steps. This new finding justifies a re-examination of the chemical
structures of serotype-specific carbohydrates. One of the goals of the proposed study is to
determine the molecular structure of SCC isolated from S. mutans using mild, non-destructive
methods. Moreover, little is known about the multienzyme processes involved in attachment of
the glucose side-chains to the polyrhamnose backbone of SCC and the function of the glycerol
phosphate modification in S. mutans. Our preliminary findings revealed that the glycerol
phosphate modification plays important roles in S. mutans morphology, autolysis, resistance to
antimicrobials and biofilm formation. We propose to identify and functionally characterize the
enzymes involved in glucose side-chain attachment to polyrhamnose, and investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of glycerol phosphate modification in
morphology, autolysis and biofilm formation. To accomplish our goals, we will employ
streptococcal genetics, in vitro enzymology, NMR spectroscopy of polysaccharides, analytical
chemistry, mass spectrometric analysis of phospholipids, and various methods of microscopy
including AFM-based nanomechanics. The cell wall biosynthetic machinery is an historically
preferred target for the development of novel antimicrobials. In order to validate the pathway of
SCC decoration with glycerol phosphate as a potential drug target, we will determine the role of
this modification in a rat caries model. Successful outcomes will guide future studies of cell wall
biogenesis in other important Gram-positive bacteria and the development of novel strategies to
treat S. mutans infections."
10745918,"Reciprocal interactions between axons and Schwann cells (SCs) drive the formation, function, and maintenance
of myelinated nerves, which are essential for effective saltatory conduction and neurologic function. Extrinsic
signals from the axon and the basal lamina (BL) cooperatively drive expression of a series of SC transcription
factors (TFs), culminating in the expression of Egr2, the master regulator of PNS myelination. Egr2 is required
for SCs to advance from the promyelinating stage, when they wrap axons once, to myelination, when they
upregulate myelin components and form the multilamellar myelin sheath. Myelinating SCs in turn re-organize
axons into distinct domains, in particular the node of Ranvier, and increase axon size. These collective changes
enable and optimize action potential propagation by saltatory conduction. The importance of this regulation of
axon biology by SCs is underscored by the disability associated with acquired and inherited (e.g., Charcot Marie
Tooth (CMT) disorders of myelinating SCs (mSCs). CMTs that result from various SC mutations cause
de/dysmyelination characterized by slow nerve conduction velocity (NCV), often with nerve conduction block
(NCB). Pathologic features of CMTs typically include inflammation, hypertrophic changes, reduced axon
diameters and (distal) axon loss. The resulting neurological disability can range from minor to severe. How SC
defects drive this array of cellular pathologies and what mechanisms underlie the clinical spectrum of CMTs are
key questions with important translational implications. To interrogate how SC pathology impacts axon biology
and leads to clinical defects, we are characterizing mice in which two key SC proteins, Egr2 and the G coupled
protein receptor, Gpr126 have been deleted. Conditional knockouts (cKOs) of either of these proteins arrest SCs
at the promyelinating stage and blocks their ability to form myelin. Yet these mice have very different phenotypes:
Gpr126 cKOs are mildly affected and have a normal life span whereas Egr2 cKOs are progressively paralyzed
and moribund by 3-4 months of age. As expected, NCV is markedly slow in both mutants. However, only the
Egr2 cKOs exhibit frank NCB, a likely driver of their severe disability. Correspondingly, these mutants have very
distinct nerve pathologies. Egr2 cKOs nerves are markedly inflamed, hypertrophic, and their axons are
significantly smaller as compared to Gpr126 cKOs. To further elucidate differences between these mutants, we
will investigate: i) the role of inflammation in their respective phenotypes and why these dysmyelinating SCs
differentially activate inflammation, ii) examine the mechanisms by which these SC mutations regulate axon
diameter and iii) use single nuclei RNAseq to characterize changes in the transcriptomes of SCs that impact
axon biology and function in nerve conduction. These studies should provide important new insights into how
SC pathology impacts axon biology and function and may lead to new therapeutic strategies to ameliorate
disability in disorders of myelinated fibers."
10747433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 GABAergic interneurons are central to the normal development and function of neocortical circuits. In
particular, cells that express the peptide somatostatin (SST-INs) are thought to play critical roles in both
spontaneous and sensory-evoked neuronal activity, primarily via their robust inhibition of the dendrites of
excitatory pyramidal neurons. However, the functional roles of the diverse classes of SST-INs in deep
cortical layers remain unknown. Furthermore, whereas the role of SST-INs in superficial cortical layers of
adult animals has been well characterized, their function in developing cortical circuits is unknown. Indeed,
the organization of synaptic connectivity of SST-INs at various developmental time points remains
unexplored. Our preliminary data suggest the surprising finding that the circuit-level influence of SST-INs is
not yet present at eye opening in juvenile mice, potentially revealing a critical developmental trajectory for
the influence of these interneurons and their contribution to visual processing. To further explore this
observation, we propose to combine a number of methodological approaches, including optogenetic
manipulations, 2-photon and electrophysiological monitoring of neuronal signaling, and in vivo
pharmacological manipulations. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) The extensive inputs to SST-INs
and their influence on local and large-scale cortical circuits develop during the postnatal period. (2) SST-IN
populations in superficial and deep layers of visual cortex are functionally distinct and differentially regulated
by behavioral state. (3) The activity of SST-INs and their underlying excitatory and neuromodulatory synaptic
drivers are strongly regulated by developmental age. Our results will provide an unprecedented level of
insight into the development and function of SST-INs and their relationship to visual processing in the
neocortex."
10928082,"Patients with prior coronary revascularization have a high risk of major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE) after major surgery, up to more than 2-fold when compared to patients without
prior coronary revascularization. The pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulable states induced by
surgery and the hemodynamic changes caused by fluid shifts and anesthesia are all important
triggers of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Indeed, peri-operative systemic inflammation is
associated with a nearly 4-fold increase in the risk of perioperative MACE. Neutrophils, the most
abundant of inflammatory cells, adhere to inflamed or injured endothelium, migrate into the
vessel wall, release proteolytic enzymes that can lead to erosion or rupture of plaque. Peri-
operative cytokine generation may also activate the inflammasome and, thereby, macrophage-
mediated synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1β, a known target for therapy for secondary prevention of
MACE, particularly in the setting of high C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.
Colchicine is a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent that preferentially accumulates in
neutrophils compared with other inflammatory cells. Colchicine inhibits chemotaxis, endothelial
adhesion, and extravasation of neutrophils at sites of endothelial injury or inflammation;
suppresses the inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1β by macrophages; and reduces
inflammation and MACE in patients with cardiovascular disease. The Colchicine Cardiovascular
Outcomes Trial and Low Dose Colchicine 2 Trial demonstrated a reduction in MACE with
colchicine in about 4000 patients with prior myocardial infarction and about 5000 patients with
stable coronary artery disease, respectively. My VA CDA-funded Colchicine-PCI trial
demonstrated for the first time that administration of colchicine prior to injury dampens the
inflammatory response measured by CRP. The effects of colchicine on peri-operative MACE in
patients with prior coronary revascularization undergoing major surgery, remains unknown.
The aims of this proposal are to 1) assess the effect of colchicine on peri-operative MACE in
response to intermediate- or high-risk non-cardiac surgery in patients with prior coronary
revascularization; 2) characterize the level of systemic inflammation and profile of peri-operative
neutrophils in this population; and 3) determine the clinical and genetic predictors of peri-
operative MACE and examine factors that determine heterogeneity of treatment response in this
population. This proposal offers the opportunity to use colchicine to delineate the role of
inflammation in the development of post-operative inflammation, as well as test this potentially
cost-effective therapy in the reduction of peri-operative MACE with minimal systemic
immunosuppression. The proposal also aims to foster a personalized medicine approach to
peri-operative cardiovascular optimization based on use of inflammatory markers and
pharmacogenetics to identify factors that predict patients who are at risk of peri-operative MACE
despite the use of colchicine and may, therefore, require alternative anti-inflammatory or anti-
thrombotic therapy. Finally, findings from this study may also open a door to novel therapeutic
strategies in other settings of cardiovascular inflammation and injury (e.g., peripheral artery
disease, stroke) and other disease states in which neutrophils play a pivotal role (e.g., vasculitis,
wound healing)."
10786091,"Abstract
Lysosomes are highly specialized and dynamic cellular organelles, which constitute an acidic environment in
the cell and are metabolic active by receiving and degrading macromolecules from the secretory, endocytic,
autophagic and phagocytic trafficking pathways. At the same time, lysosomes act as the signaling center of the
cell, and the metabolic status of the lysosome actively regulates nuclear transcription to govern various cellular
activities, such as cell growth, metabolism and quality control. Misregulation of lysosomal activity has been
associated with aging and age-associated diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Lysosomal
Metabolomics and pH Core (Core C) will support three Research Projects in this PPG proposal to assess
changes in lysosomal pH and metabolic activity through harnessing the power of high-throughput, high
accuracy Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics and high-resolution fluorescence lifetime imaging
microscopy (FLIM). We will 1) perform lysosome-specific metabolomic profiling in aging and tauopathy mouse
models, 2) assess lysosomal pH changes using FLIM. In addition, Core C will carry both technological and
conceptual innovations by developing new technological platforms and by creating the first-in-class Aging- and
Tauopathy-associated Lysosomal atlas (ATLas) of the lysosomal proteome and metabolome for mouse cortex
and hippocampus in collaboration with Core A and Core B. Together, these studies will advance our current
knowledge regarding the association between lysosomal functions and aging and AD tauopathy and provide
powerful techniques and valuable resources to the fields of lysosomal biology, aging biology, and AD
pathology."
10786093,"Abstract
Aging is characterized by the progressive inability of cells, tissues, and organs to maintain their functional
integrity and is accompanied by an increased susceptibility to morbidity—the odds to develop
neurodegeneration, cancer, or cardiovascular disease increase continuously with age. There is currently no
general, actionable strategy to slow down dysregulation of cell and tissue homeostasis in the aging organism.
As a result, advances in healthcare in the modern era have paradoxically increased frailty and morbidity
among the elderly by increasing lifespan without significantly impacting on age-related homeostasis
dysregulation. Owing to a continuously aging world population, there is therefore an urgent and unmet need to
identify actionable cellular and molecular targets for the development of treatments aimed at increasing
healthspan along with lifespan. Hallmarks of aging are a decline in lysosome-mediated degradation pathways
and chromatin dysregulation. This proposal focuses on a transcription factor EB-mediated lysosome-to-nucleus
signaling pathway, the modulation of which extends mouse lifespan by 30% in males. We will systematically
and mechanistically investigate the three components of this signaling pathway—namely the lysosome, the
signaling transducers, and chromatin regulators—during aging by leveraging unique tools that we have
developed to study lysosomal content and signaling components. Results from this study will provide the first
age-associated atlas of the lysosomal content in the mammalian brain and will pioneer the investigation of
lysosome-to-nucleus signaling in aging. Knowledge resulting from this study could lay the foundation for future
translational investigations of clinical treatment of aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease."
10754292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Since 2010, we have observed steep increases in geographic inequality in mortality that have been
strongly tied to stalled mortality declines at the prime adult ages (i.e., 25-64). To date, researchers have
analyzed the effects of unemployment, prescription drug monitoring programs, changes in cardiometabolic risk,
cigarette smoking, education, health care access, state policies, and a number of other factors thought to
influence geographic disparities in mortality. One process that has not been examined in relation to rising
geographic inequality in mid-life mortality is migration. Migration has enormous potential to impact geographic
inequalities in mortality since it not only configures the makeup of an area, but also influences the properties of
a place that themselves may impinge on mortality. Thus, this project examines the contribution of international
and domestic migration to levels of and trends in mortality and geographic inequality in mortality. Our analyses
focus on both inequality within the United States and inequality between the U.S. and other high-income
countries. We use vital statistics and census microdata linked to mortality follow-up to assess how international
and domestic migration have direct impacts on mortality inequality by concentrating healthy, low-mortality
migrants in specific parts of the country, and indirect impacts on non-migrant mortality by reshaping the
characteristics of places that have been shown to influence mortality levels. We provide the first subnational
estimates of mortality by nativity and the first estimates for the U.S. of the effects of domestic migration on
geographic inequality in mid-life mortality. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we identify the causal
effect of migration on non-migrants, constituting the first demonstration of the magnitude of spillover effects on
U.S. mortality. While countries differ in their proportions foreign-born and in their migration streams, it is not yet
known how immigration impacts cross-national inequality in mortality. We investigate how international
migration contributes to the U.S. life expectancy shortfall and to variation in mortality across high-income
countries, including in measures of life expectancy, mid-life mortality, and lifespan inequality. An important
byproduct of this project is that we will release a public database of high-quality life tables for the native-born
and foreign-born populations of the U.S. and other high-income countries, as well as a public database of life
tables for the native- and foreign-born populations of geographic areas within the United States. This project
provides new theoretical knowledge of how people and places respond to migration, and of the multiplicity of
dynamic responses of mortality to migration trends. Methodologically, this project builds out a new set of
demographic methods that allow model-based heterogeneous mortality rates to be linked to counties on the
basis of individual and county-level characteristics. It also applies a set of causal methods that have not
previously been used to study mortality in order to model the geographically differentiated spillover effects of
migration on mortality."
10757050,"Both neural crest progenitors and ectodermal placode cells arise from the neural plate border (NPB).
While the neural crest gives rise to the craniofacial skeleton, the placodes form the lens, ear and olfactory system;
both contribute to cranial sensory ganglia. However, rather than being fixed to a neural crest or placodal fate,
our results show that cells in the neural plate border appear to coexpress transcription factors characteristic of
multiple lineages, ranging from neural crest to neural to placodal. Moreover, we find there is a stem cell niche
within the dorsal neural tube that expresses pluripotency factors including Sall4, Nanog, Oct4, Klf4, and cMyc
as confirmed in our single cell RNA-seq data. Thus, the question of what maintains stem cells with the potential
to form neural crest, placode and neural tube derivatives at the neural plate border remains open. Our preliminary
data suggest that Sall4 may form a feed-back loop with other multipotency genes, including Pou5f3/Oct4 and
Sall1. Moreover, overexpression of Sall4 prevents neural crest specification and upregulates Oct4. To test the
hypothesis that these pluripotency factors maintain multipotency of the neural plate border and that
their downregulation is necessary for neural crest and/or placode specification, we will explore the effects
of their gain and loss of function, identify enhancers that mediate their expression and examine dynamic changes
in their gene expression during neural plate border maturation. To this end, the following aims will be performed.
Aim 1: Effects of ectopic maintenance or loss of pluripotency factors on neural crest and placode
development. We will test the role of pluripotency factors Sall4, Oct4, Nanog and Klf4 in vivo in neural plate
border development using gain and loss of function approaches coupled with single cell RNA-seq. In particular,
we will test the hypothesis that these pluripotency factors maintain the multipotency of the neural plate border
and their downregulation is necessary for completion of neural crest specification. We will also examine other
transcription factors to test their role in driving lineage specification at the neural plate border.
Aim 2: Identification and cis-regulatory analysis of putative enhancers mediating expression of
pluripotency factors and neural plate border transcriptional regulators. Detailed cis-regulatory analysis
allows identification of active enhancers and their direct inputs, both positive and negative, thus informing upon
gene regulatory network connections. We propose to use single cell ATAC-seq to identify putative regulatory
elements active at the forming neural plate border, particularly those mediating expression of pluripotency factors
and transcriptional regulators. Putative enhancers will be tested for inputs and their ability to drive expression.
Aim 3: Dynamic analysis of enhancer-mediated expression during maturation of the neural plate border.
By coupling live imaging with enhancer driven reporter expression, we propose to test dynamic changes in gene
expression mediated by pluripotency genes and transcription factors. We will initially focus on enhancers that
mediate expression of Pax7, Sox2 and Six1, characteristic of neural crest, neural and placodes, respectively."

Protein misfolding underpins several neurodegenerative disorders including frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In
FTD the misfolding of several different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with prion-like domains, including TDP-43
and FUS, are implicated. Prion-like domains are intrinsically disordered, making these proteins highly
aggregation-prone. RBPs are also known to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS is a
physiological response that allows sequestration and protection of essential cellular components, and for RBPs,
RNA is a key modulator of this process. However, the localized concentration of proteins can be quite high upon
LLPS, further increasing aggregation propensity. Indeed, pathological inclusions of TDP-43 are found in over
half of FTD patients. Further, many other proteins are known to co-aggregate with TDP-43, and synergistic
corruption of protein homeostasis may underpin FTD. Recently Matrin-3 (MATR3) aggregation was implicated
in FTD, and MATR3 has several key similarities and differences as compared to TDP-43 and FUS. However,
MATR3 remains poorly understood, and conflicting results have been reported in different studies. We therefore
aim to leverage our unique skillset to delineate the properties of MATR3 with respect to LLPS, RNA binding, and
interactions with other FTD-linked proteins. Understanding these mechanisms will provide fundamental
knowledge to inform new therapeutic development, particularly for new RNA therapeutics that might restore
physiological LLPS. We hypothesize that corrupted binding of MATR3 to RNA and other FTD-linked proteins can
synergize, driving FTD pathogenesis. In this proposal, we will investigate the specific mechanisms by which
MATR3 undergoes LLPS and how its LLPS is perturbed in FTD. Further, we will investigate the specific
mechanism by which LLPS leads to quality control malfunction in cells. We will also investigate how interactions
of MATR3 with RNA and other FTD-associated proteins synergize in FTD. To test these ideas, my lab has
developed a genetically tractable yeast system to probe the drivers of MATR3 toxicity and aberrant LLPS. We
have also pioneered purification of full-length MATR3, which will allow us to reconstitute its putative interactions
with RNA and other FTD-associated RBPs. Key findings will be validated in mammalian cells. In sum, we will
meet the following aims: 1) Define the molecular determinants of Matrin-3 liquid-liquid phase separation, and
how liquid-liquid phase separation is perturbed in ALS/FTD and 2) Elucidate the interactions of Matrin-3 with
RNA and other ALS/FTD-associated proteins. Successful completion of this project will provide us with new
fundamental knowledge of the factors modulating MATR3 LLPS, how MATR3 LLPS is corrupted in FTD, and
how LLPS might be therapeutically modulated."

The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities
Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non-
Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable
populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the
effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those
measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered
nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions
from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to
study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve
American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity
community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are
related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native
populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and
movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs
and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and
facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource
and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long-
term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary
datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI
populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of
COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the
secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care,
would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis
of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future
effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on
tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI
tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the
C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because
it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and
recommendations for future policy implementation."

The Cell Biology/Morphology Core provides BADERC investigators with technical support, equipment, advice
and expertise for cell biological, immunocytochemical and morphological studies related to cell/membrane
biology and signal transduction; cellular immunology and islet cell biology; and vascular and endothelial cell
biology. The Core is located within the MGH Program in Membrane Biology facility on the 8th floor of the Simches
Research Center, which is adjacent to the MGH main campus. The Core Director, Dr. Brown, is an expert in the
area of membrane biology, membrane proteins, and intracellular trafficking. He has a long and well-documented
track record of operating Core facilities at MGH over the past 25 years, including this BADERC Core for over 20
years. The goal of this Core is to provide access to integrated cellular imaging solutions and related expertize for
problems in Diabetes and other BADERC-targeted research areas that few or no isolated laboratories have the
resources to develop individually. The Cell Biology Core is designed, therefore, to maximize the use and
availability of specialized pieces of equipment, that are not only prohibitively expensive for many laboratories,
but that also require expensive and regular maintenance, and appropriate technical expertise to use. The Core
performs all aspects of microscopy from routine immunofluorescence imaging, confocal microscopy, and
(immuno)electron microscopy. The Core is especially proud of its record in successfully attracting NIH Shared
Instrumentation Grants (SIGs) and institutional support over the years. With support of Core users, we have
obtained 6 SIGs in little more than 12 years, the most recent of which was a $450K award in 2016 for a new
Zeiss LSM800 Airyscan confocal platform that offers high sensitivity/high resolution imaging and analysis
capabilities to BADERC users. Our other major confocal platform, a Nikon A1R confocal system, offers real time
imaging in a temperature controlled chamber, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and a SIG (for $300K) that was submitted in May 2021 to request major
upgrades received an outstanding score of 20 and should be funded. We also offer laser cut microdissection
and total internal reflection imaging. We also offer routine embedding and sectioning, and basic
immunofluorescence incubation expertize. A major and important objective of the Core is to provide training of
key personnel from participating laboratories, a strategy that has worked very successfully over the prior funding
periods. Dr. Brown and his highly-qualified technical support staff have well-established and proven procedures
for maximizing Core use in the context of varied projects and specific experimental requirements. We pay special
attention to quality control procedures for image capture and analysis, and we have protocols for antibody
verification to comply with current Rigor and Reproducibility standards. The bottom line is that this Core continues
to work smoothly, as in the past. Its use has resulted in several hundred publications over that time that contain
images taken by Core staff, or by trained users, including over 90 in the previous BADERC funding period. We
expect this to continue and increase based on the usage proposed in this application."
10802428,"The gram-negative bacterial outer membrane glycolipid lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized by both
the cell surface TLR4 complex and cytosolic sensors. Recognition of bacterial LPS in the cytosol induces the
activation of the caspase-4/caspase-5 (CASP4/5, human) or CASP11 (mouse) inflammasome, signaling
platforms that trigger pyroptotic cell death. The dogma for recognition of bacterial LPS, based on the simplest
interpretation of non-physiological data showing that CASP4/11 bind bacterial LPS in vitro, is that cytosolic
bacterial LPS is directly sensed by CASP4/11 rather than by a pattern recognition receptor. We recently found
that NLRP11, a poorly characterized primate-specific member of a family of pattern recognition receptors, is a
pattern recognition receptor for cytosolic bacterial LPS.
 We found that efficient cell death induced by cytosolic bacterial LPS in human macrophages depends on
NLRP11 function in the CASP4 inflammasome pathway. We initially identified NLRP11 in a genome-wide
screen of human myeloid-derived cells for factors that promote cell death during infection with the gram-
negative bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri. We propose to leverage our findings to uncover mechanisms of
NLRP11 function in cytosolic bacterial LPS-triggered activation of the human CASP4 inflammasome, including
the role of variants of S. flexneri LPS in this process.
1. Define determinants of host-pathogen interaction of NLRP11 with bacterial LPS and caspase(s)
and of NLRP11 specificity for caspase(s). We will define the molecular domains and sequences that
mediate bacterial LPS interaction with NLRP11 and NLRP11 with CASP4.
2. Determine mechanisms of host NLRP11-mediated activation of CASP4 in response to cytosolic
bacterial pathogens and cytosolic bacterial LPS. We will test our hypothesis that resting state NLRP11 is
autoinhibited and activated NLRP11 triggers CASP4 activation by proximity-induced dimerization and will test
the requirements for bacterial LPS in NLRP11 activation.
3. Test whether host NLRP11 recognition is modulated by specific LPS modifications or modes of
LPS delivery by gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We will determine the role of selected modifications of
LPS from S. flexneri on its recognition by NLRP11 and on NLRP11-dependent CASP4 activation and will test
our hypothesis that NLRP11 is most critical to CASP4 responses when S. flexneri LPS is in micelle-reducing
conditions.
 Our focus is to determine mechanisms of cytosolic bacterial LPS-triggered NLRP11-mediated activation of
the human CASP4 inflammasome. We are uniquely positioned to accomplish these goals. Our insights are
likely to have broad implications for gram-negative pathogenesis and thus be of great interest to the
pathogenesis community."

Clean drinking water is crucial to human health and longevity. Despite enormous improvements in water
treatment over the early 20th century, drinking water pollution remains a critical threat to US public health,
particularly for older people and individuals with chronic conditions. In an effort to protect public health, federal
regulations set drinking water quality standards and regulate the public water purification systems and pipes that
carry treated water to households for human consumption. An estimated $473 billion in current national
construction funding is needed to achieve compliance with drinking water standards, even as much remains
unknown about how polluted drinking water affects health, especially among older Americans. Policy debates
about drinking water regulations highlight the need for an improved understanding of the benefits and costs of
drinking water regulations, including determining whether drinking water investments should be increased and
ensuring that safe drinking water remains accessible and affordable to vulnerable communities. This project
seeks to add substantially to the existing stock of knowledge about the health effects of drinking water pollution
by studying the effects of large federal loans intended to upgrade drinking water treatment plants that service
residential communities. By harnessing quasi-experimental variation in loan receipt, the project will examine how
these loans affect drinking water pollution and how they shape short- and long-run mortality and disease burdens
among older Americans. Because some loans target specific pollutants, like arsenic or pathogens, the analysis
will examine the extent to which these loans specifically affect the pollutants they target and the health conditions
associated with those pollutants. To enable this research, the project will compile the most complete set of
records on drinking water systems linked to pollution measures based on Freedom of Information Act requests
made to each of the 50 states. These data will be posted online to catalyze broader research on drinking water
pollution and health. This project will combine these drinking water records with the most comprehensive
individual-level health dataset—Medicare administrative data for 100% of beneficiaries—allowing for rigor,
accuracy, and generalizability of findings. Beneficiary identifiers will allow us to follow individuals over time
regardless of whether and where they relocate, with minimal attrition. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit zip
code of residence, allowing the analysis to pinpoint the location of individuals more precisely than prior research.
In addition, the analysis will examine the extent to which low-income communities and communities of color
benefit equally from drinking water improvement policies, both in spending and health terms, and it will
summarize the distribution of drinking water quality by household race, income, and other important
demographics."

Efforts to amplify the body’s immune system against cancer has faced a barrier due to the body’s own
immunosuppressive tumor-promoting mechanisms, as commonly present for many cancers. We are dissecting
these shared mechanisms by focusing on specific immunosuppressive cells in the tumor with the goal of
developing effective therapeutic approaches by targeting these cells to treat cancer. In this proposal, we
investigate the potential tumor-promoting role of a specific regulatory T (Treg) cell subset, called follicular
regulatory T (TFR) cells. TFR cells are known to regulate follicular helper T (TFH) cells, B-cells and germinal center
(GC) antibody responses, while the intensity of TFH cells, B-cells and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in many
cancers predict improved clinical outcomes and responses to cancer immunotherapy. However, the contribution
of TFR cells and humoral antibody responses to the regulation of anti-tumor immunity and tumor progression
remains to be largely unexplored. Our recent study of TFR cells has revealed that these cells accumulate in
murine and human melanoma. The functional stability and suppressive activity of TFR cells in the tumor require
the expression of the transcription factor Blimp1. Deletion of Blimp1 in Treg cells not only results in impaired
suppressive activity, but also leads to the expansion of TIL TFH cells and GC B-cells, and enhanced tumoral IgE
deposition secondary to TFR dysregulation. Further analysis revealed that higher tumoral TFR signatures along
with PRDM1 expression indicated increased malignancy and risk of metastasis in various cancers. Increased
IgE was associated with the activation and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via the IgE
high affinity receptor FcεRIα, potentially remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME). These unexpected
findings lead us to hypothesize that intratumoral TFR cells negatively impact the TME and promote tumor
progression by repressing IgE-mediated anti-tumor immunity, and disrupting intratumoral TFR suppressive
activity improves tumor control. Using genetically-modified mice and various tumor models, we will define the
functional capacity and mechanistic action of TFR cells in the regulation of tumor progression, define the
contribution of IgE to anti-tumor immunity and the TME remodeling. Finally, we will validate the TFR-IgE/FCERIA
axis in human tumors. Completion of this study will reveal the previously unappreciated cell type, TFR cells, as a
cancer prognostic biomarker and the IgE response as a predictor to the TIL TFR cell function. Insights gained
from this project will facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets and predictive markers to therapeutic
outcome, and the development of effective approaches to treat a broad spectrum of cancers."
10791929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer is a prevalent disease and consume many lives every year. Disease relapse, invasion and
metastases are the main causes of death. Recent discoveries provide compelling evidence that at least some
types of cancer are initiated and maintained by a small population of malignant cells called cancer-initiating
stem cells (CICs). Relapse, invasion, and metastases are explained by the fact that CICs have a different
biology than all the other tumor cells and, importantly, are resistant to chemotherapies and radiation. Lung
CICs have been shown to represent about 1–15% of all tumor cells and can form tumors with injections as low
as 100 cells. Evidence from published studies have demonstrated that human, as well as rodent, cancers
contain populations of cells that express embryonic stem (ES) cell antigens. Cells containing these proteins
also express markers used to identify lung CICs; therefore, we hypothesized that ES cells and CICs share
several common molecular traits. To test this hypothesis, we vaccinated mice with exosomes derived from ES
cells expressing GM-CSF and investigated whether an anti-tumor immune response was elicited. We
discovered that ES cell-derived exosome-based vaccination strategy (ES-exo vaccine) is very effective in
preventing both implantable and carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinoma development without any
detectable toxicity or signs of autoimmunity. Recently published results from our laboratory reveal that
splenocytes from ES cell-immunized mice are preferentially cytotoxic to lung CICs. Experiments proposed in
this application seek to expand these novel findings to convincingly demonstrate that ES-exo vaccine
immunize against lung cancer-associated CICs and that anti-CIC immunity is responsible for preventing lung
adenocarcinoma development. The anti-tumor activities of ES-exo vaccine as well as their immunostimulatory
properties will be investigated in in vitro and in vivo lung cancer mouse models. Experiments proposed in this
study will address the translational potential of our novel ES-exo vaccine as a cell-free prophylactic vaccine
modality in implantable, transgenic and xenograft mouse models of lung cancer. One of the major goals of this
application is to identify tumor antigens important for anti-lung cancer efficacy of ES-exo vaccine using a
proteomics-based screening methodology. To fulfill the stated objectives, the following aims are proposed: 1)
Investigate whether lung cancer-initiating cells are targets of ES cell-derived exosomes (ES-exo) vaccination-
induced anti-tumor immunity, and 2) Evaluate the translational potential of ES cell-derived exosomes (ES-exo)
as a novel cell-free vaccine for lung cancer. Our proposed study will provide important insights towards
developing a safe prophylactic vaccine for lung cancer onset and/or recurrence."

Adolescent use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, or e-cigarettes) has increased rapidly and can
lead to nicotine addiction and adversely affect brain development. Conversely, ENDS products can help adults
quit smoking, decreasing their cancer risk. This creates a major tradeoff in risks and benefits that must be
considered when evaluating ENDS control policies, in addition to other aspects such as costs and political
feasibility. State public health administrators are at the forefront of ENDS control policy efforts. Public health
research could guide their decision making, but research evidence is often inaccessible to decision makers or
not synthesized concisely and meaningfully. Without strategies to disseminate evidence in an accessible way it
is of limited public health impact. Existing dissemination strategies have been largely untested and have not
accounted for the inherent complexity of policy decisions (e.g., tradeoffs). The goal of this proposal is to
develop and evaluate a potential dissemination strategy: a decision support tool. Such tools can help manage
decision complexity by systematically presenting information on relevant attributes of specific policies that are
important to administrators (e.g., reach of policy, potential harms and benefits, costs to implement), and
improve research accessibility by synthesizing evidence for each attribute. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr.
Smith, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School, will quantify the relative importance of key attributes
of policies that administrators consider in their decision making using a discrete choice experiment. In the R00
phase, she will build a decision support tool for administrators using principles of multi-criteria decision
analysis, peer-reviewed research evidence, and quantitative results from the K99 phase. She will then conduct
a pilot study with administrators to evaluate the potential for the decision support tool to improve research
dissemination by assessing the tool’s acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, three key preconditions for
success. This research will provide much-needed evidence on the use of decision support tools to advance
evidence-informed policymaking. Further, this award will enable Dr. Smith to achieve her long-term career goal
of becoming an independent investigator focused on evidence-informed public health policies for cancer
prevention. Dr. Smith has a strong foundation in simulation modeling and economic evaluation; this award will
build on this foundation by providing advanced training in decision science methods and develop her expertise
in tobacco control policy. Her K99 training plan draws on the unique strengths of her transdisciplinary
mentorship team and educational and professional resources available through the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health. Overall, the research and training activities in this proposal will provide Dr. Smith with the
experience necessary to launch her career as an independent scientist working at the intersection of decision
science, policy implementation and dissemination science, and cancer prevention and control policies."

The malignant brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable with little improvement in patient outcomes
over many decades. The success of immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in other
cancers has not been replicated so far in GBM. Effective application of immunotherapy for GBM may need
combination therapies based on detailed understanding of molecular biology and immunosuppressive
mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), as well as preclinical studies of rational synergistic
therapeutic combinations to inform and develop effective future clinical trials. In this resubmitted R21 proposal
we will build on preliminary data showing inhibition of expression of IDO1 and altered TME in GBM by the drug
PPRX-1701, a newly developed bioavailable formulation of the indirubin derivative 6-bromoindirubin-3'-
acetoxime (BiA), to understand its mechanism of action and provide preclinical data which may support its use
in human GBM patients. BiA is a chemically modified form of indirubin, a natural product derived from the indigo
plant which is an active component of anti-inflammatory Traditional Chinese Medicines, which has been used to
treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and psoriasis. Our previously published studies showed that BiA could
prolong survival of human GBM xenografts in mice via effects on invasion, proliferation and angiogenesis.
However, we did not examine the potential immunological effects of BiA, and the further development of this
concept was hampered by poor solubility which limits applicability in patients.
PPRX-1701 is a BiA/copolymer nanoparticle suspension that can be efficiently systemically delivered safely by
intravenous injection, where it increases survival in GBM-bearing immunocompetent mice. Our initial studies of
PPRX-1701 in murine GBM show targeting of intracranial tumors and alterations in TME composition including
increased CD8+ T cells, and decreased tumor promoting macrophages. We have also shown that BiA/PPRX-
1701 potently blocks induction of the immunosuppressive enzyme IDO1 by interferon- We therefore
hypothesize that BiA/PPRX-1701 promotes alterations in the TME as a result of inhibition of immunosuppressive
pathways, increasing animal survival and anti-tumor immunity. Here we propose in Aim 1 to determine optimal
dosing, biodistribution, toxicity and efficacy in multiple murine GBM models. In Aim 2 we will characterize in
detail the molecular and cellular alterations associated with PPRX-1701 treatment in vivo, and test combination
immunotherapies with a view to clinical translation if data supports.
The experiments described here will rapidly establish mechanism and applicability of PPRX-1701 for GBM
treatment, and provide a platform for future detailed studies and informed clinical trials."

Our goal is to advance our current intravitreal gene therapy platform consisting of DNA nanoparticles (DNA-
NPs)/hyaluronic acid nanospheres (HA-NSs) to deliver large genes in order to develop safe/effective therapies
for visual loss in Usher Syndrome type 2A (USH2A). Currently, there are no treatments for USH2A. Our
complementary expertise in nanoformulation and in molecular biology/physiology of the visual and auditory
systems will facilitate the advancement of our non-viral therapy to rescue vision loss associated with the most
common USH2A mutation in usherin, c.2299delG. Our platform consists of: 1) CK30PEG DNA-NPs that
efficiently transfect photoreceptors (PRs), exert no toxic effects after multiple injections, and are distributed
throughout the subretinal space in both mouse and baboon models. Critically, these DNA-NPs provide
structural/functional rescue in multiple mouse retinal disease models. 2) HA-NS made of hyaluronic acid which
house DNA or DNA-NPs for controlled long-term DNA release. HA-NSs are capable of reaching the PRs after
intravitreal delivery. 3) Sulfotyrosine (ST), which is a non-toxic small molecule that enhances retinal penetration
of intravitreally delivered HA-NS. 4) Engineered DNA vectors with genomic elements to carry and promote
expression of large therapeutic genes. Developing an effective treatment for USH2A has been challenging due
to its large coding sequence (15.8 kb) that has precluded its delivery using standard approaches and the
presence of multiple isoforms with functions that are not fully understood. We have already cloned two usherin
isoforms to be tested with our innovative platform (DNA-NP/HA-NS/ST) to safely advance gene therapy for
USH2A. We will use three previously generated knockin mouse models to learn more about usherin transcripts,
isoforms, and their role in PRs to help develop well-designed therapies for USH2A. The models are: 1) UNYFP,
where YFP with a 3XFlag tag was inserted after the secretory sequence at the N-terminus of Ush2a; 2)
UCmKate, where mKATE2 with a 3XMyc tag was inserted at the C-terminus before the transmembrane domain
of Ush2a; and 3) ush2aG/G, where the mouse-equivalent of human c.2299delG mutation was introduced followed
by the human 20 aa extension followed by 3XFlag tag. In aim 1, we will evaluate Ush2a isoforms in the retina
vs cochlea, the mechanism of auditory and visual defects in the ush2aG/G model, and in vitro testing of the most
suitable Ush2a isoform(s) for gene therapy. In aim 2, we will investigate the transduction efficiency and
therapeutic efficacy of Ush2a-containing intravitreally delivered DNA-NPs/HA-NSs/ST in the ush2aG/G model.
First, we will perform short-term studies to evaluate the ability of intravitreal vs subretinally delivered usherin to
generate gene expression in PRs in the ush2aG/G retina. Second, we will longitudinally assess long-term

10815695,"Project Summary/Abstract 
Research proposed in this grant application builds on extensive genetic, biochemical and animal studies
designed to further characterize and validate biliverdin IXβ reductase (BLVRB) as a novel cellular target
regulating human platelet production in situations of stress hematopoiesis, with concomitant effects on
erythroid development and repopulation. Although heme degradation is largely studied as a processing
pathway designed to clear pro-oxidant (free) heme generated during cellular senescence (or metabolism),
heme catabolic enzymes are also known to maintain function(s) in cellular signaling and cytoprotection, and
tetrapyrrole byproducts biliverdin (BV) and bilirubin (BR) function in redox reactions as potent buffer(s) against
oxidant stress. We now challenge existing dogma, hypothesizing that redox-regulated activity involving heme
catabolism functions in a unique metabolic pathway controlling hematopoietic lineage fate with divergent
effects on erythroid/megakaryocyte balance. Research goals are accomplished through two synergistic
specific aims, designed to (1) delineate cellular mechanisms of BLVRB-regulated Mk/Erythroid redox coupling
and cytoprotection in vitro, and (2) define and expand upon mechanisms of lineage-restricted speciation and
cytoprotection in vivo, collectively designed to dissect Blvrb-regulated perturbed pathways controlling E/Meg
lineage speciation from MEPs during stress hematopoiesis. Basic science implications are broadly relevant to
(1) metabolic and bioenergetic consequences of hematopoiesis, (2) heme-regulated redox chemistry, and (3)
novel cellular target validation. Clinical/translational implications are designed to enhance our understanding
of mechanisms of disease pertaining to stem cell metabolism, aging, anemia and platelet production. Unique
reagents and cell lines generated and characterized include (1) murine models of Blvrb- and Blvra-deficiency,
(2) iPSC models with targeted BLVRB knock-outs, (3) biliverdin IXβ (and IXγ, IXδ) isomer detection and
production methodologies. All proposed studies are formulated on pre-existing studies in subject cohorts, and
proposed experiments are predicated on reagents and expertise currently available or in advanced
development among the research team."

10905983,"The goal of this renewal application is to maintain and further develop the world's most comprehensive
research resource specializing in the use of the amphibian Xenopus laevis as a multi-faceted
experimental platform for biomedical and immunological research and for the benefit of the whole
scientific community. Interests and medical relevance of X. laevis are due to the remarkable similarity of its
immune system with that of human, the accessibility to experimentation at all developmental stages, as well as
the availability of large genetic and genomic resources, invaluable MHC-defined inbred strains, clones and
transgenic (Tg) lines of frogs, as well as tools such as cell lines, monoclonal antibodies, MHC tetramers,
tagged recombinant reagents and batteries of validated PCR primers for immune-relevant genes. These
animals and reagents that are not commercially available need to be preserved, enriched, and made available
to the scientific community. As in previous proposals, two major main aims are proposed:
(1)
Preserving and promoting the X. laevis research resource for immunobiology
by keeping on
producing, managing and distributing animal stocks and reagents to laboratories in the US and abroad. We will
maintain the quality, productivity and welfare of our inbred and Tg animals. We will assist, train and inform
scientists, students and educators interested in using X. laevis for research. We will foster the information,
accessibility, networking and public awareness of the resource using our web site, and by interacting with other
Xenopus resources nationally and internationally.
(2)
Developing new methodologies and generating new experimental animals and reagents
by
leveraging X. laevis to advance research in 3 main areas: (1) Genetically modified X. laevis lines of frogs: to
improve genome annotation, generate new CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inbred Tg knockout (KO) lines and lines
with traceable immune cell types by knocking-in long single stranded donor templates (lssDNA). (2) X. laevis
cell culture systems and reagents: to produce transfected and deficient cell lines, recombinant tagged immune
reagents and MHC tetramers as well as to develop VSV-lentiviral transducing vectors for in vitro and in vivo
studies in Xenopus. (3) X. laevis experimental platforms for infectious disease and developmental
immunotoxicology: to develop cost-effective and reliable experimental platforms to study infection and
pathogenicity of emerging human non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) pathogens (e.g., M. abscessus); and
assess overlooked risk for immunity and human health of water pollutants with endocrine disruption activity. In
addition to maintaining a research resource that is crucial for the Xenopus scientific community, this project will
develop new approaches and technologies broadly applicable for gathering innovative insights into tissue and
organ physiology, immunology and developmental biology. This will contribute to the efforts of the scientific
community assisted by the NIH to establish Xenopus as a relevant model for biomedical research."
10738286,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aging often manifests as physiological decline at an organismal level. However, the aging process has
its roots at the level of cells; changes to molecules and cellular compartments ultimately underlie
physiological decline and age-related disease pathology. Clarifying cellular causes of aging has the
potential to inform strategies to promote longer, healthier lives, and may also reveal unexpected
elements of cell biology relevant to animal health and disease.
My lab has begun analysis of a new aspect of cell biology in aging: degradation of peroxisomes by
autophagy. Peroxisomes are membrane-bound eukaryotic organelles that are critical to cell health and
organismal viability; they carry out essential oxidative reactions, and they also eradicate toxins.
Remarkably, we have found that peroxisome degradation by autophagy (‘pexophagy’) specifically
occurs in young-adult animals during early aging, signifying that this may be one of a collection of
initiating events in the aging process. Indeed, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model
organism, we have discovered that the rate of pexophagy may scale with aging. Animals that show
accelerated peroxisome degradation in early age die prematurely, whereas animals in which
pexophagy is inhibited live long. Moreover, turnover of this organelle may entail unique regulation, as
we have found that pexophagy during aging, as during starvation, occurs at non-canonical autophagic
lysosomes, which are tubular in structure and morphologically dynamic.
We are now poised to make significant advancements in understanding the regulation of pexophagy,
particularly in a live-animal system, and its role in aging and longevity. In the proposed research project,
we will perform unbiased genetic screens to uncover regulators and effectors of pexophagy in live
animals during starvation and aging. To date, we know of only a handful of regulatory genes. An
expectation is that we may identify factors involved in the signaling of this event, or adapters that
potentially link peroxisomes to tubular lysosomes in these contexts. In addition, we will perform detailed
analysis of gene knockdowns that we have already described to feed into the regulation of age-
dependent pexophagy, with the goal of determining mechanisms that contribute to lifespan extension
upon pexophagy inhibition. In sum, these studies will provide information on a previously unexplored
cellular aspect of aging possibly relevant to novel longevity mechanisms."
10796779,"The endothelium of the cerebral microcirculation is a critical component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
which protects neural tissue through the presence of tight junctions between endothelial cells and efflux
transporters that extrude many compounds back into the bloodstream. When developing drug delivery strategies
for brain pathologies, these efflux transporters [e.g. multi drug resistance 1 (MDR1)] present a considerable
challenge to effective drug delivery, as they limit the exposure of central nervous system (CNS) pathologies to
many systemically administered agents. Meanwhile, nutrient transporters [e.g. glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)]
are critical for maintaining normal brain function. Indeed, genetic mutation(s) of GLUT1 can cause recurrent
epileptic seizures, microcephaly, intellectual disability, spasticity, ataxia, and dysarthria.
 Given this central role in health and disease in the brain, the endothelium of the BBB represents a rich
target for therapeutic genomic manipulation. In this proposal, we will engineer a platform technology capable of
genome editing the BBB in a safe, endothelial cell-selective, and non-invasive manner, with precise loco-regional
targeting provided by MR image-guidance. We call this approach, wherein very low pressure focused ultrasound
is used to activate plasmid-coated microbubbles, “sonoselective” gene delivery. This is because, instead of
employing a cell-specific promoter, ultrasound (i.e. “sono”) alone “selects” which cell type is transfected. Since
endothelial cell-specific promoters are unnecessary, a vast array of genetic manipulations may be employed.
 In Aim 1, we will engineer acoustically-activated delivery agents that sonoselectively edit the genome of
blood-brain barrier endothelium. This will entail testing CRISPR-Cas9 “nickase” plasmids with varying guide RNA
(gRNA) pair sequences for their ability to sonoselectively delete GLUT1 and MDR1 from BBB endothelium. We
will also test whether efficiency can be improved by incorporating plasmids into non-viral polymer nanoparticles
(NPs) that are coupled covalently to MBs with non-immunogenic linkers. The most promising compositions will
then be examined functionally using positron emission tomography (PET) [i.e. 18F-FDG for brain metabolism
changes after GLUT1 deletion and (R)-[11C]verapamil for drug efflux changes after MDR1a deletion]. Further,
single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) will be used to assess the cell selectivity and efficacy of gene deletion.
In Aim 2, we will augment the efficiency and control of sonoselective genome editing by rationally manipulating
focused ultrasound parameters. We will test whether increasing FUS burst duration improves plasmid delivery
and subsequent gene (GLUT1 and MDR1) deletion efficiency. We will also test whether we can control
sonoselective genome editing using a feedback control system based on acoustic emissions. Once completed,
we will have established a safe, non-invasive, MR image-guided, platform for genome editing of endothelium in
the BBB. We submit that such an approach will have multiple applications in pre-clinical neuroscience research
and considerable potential as a therapeutic approach to treating many diseases of the CNS."
10769775,"Abstract
Myosin molecular motors play crucial, dynamic roles in most cellular processes, including contraction,
movement, and shape change. A variety of diseases owe their origins to defects in the myosin family of
molecular motors. A prime example is inherited familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which leads to
hyper-contractility of the heart. HCM results from mutations in various cardiac muscle proteins, with mutations
in β-cardiac myosin and its associated thick filament protein myosin binding protein C (MyBPC) accounting for
about 80% of these cases. HCM is not rare, affecting as many as 1 in 200 people.  Current therapeutic
interventions for cardiomyopathies are limited to symptomatic relief, in large part because the molecular
underpinnings of the disease – how mutations affect the biomechanical interaction of myosin with its
sarcomeric partners, and thus sarcomeric force, velocity, and power output – are not well understood. Studies
using human β-cardiac myosin have shown that mutation-induced changes in the basic biochemical and
biomechanical parameters of the myosin motor do not adequately account for the cardiac hypercontractility
that is a clinical hallmark of HCM. Rather, it has recently been shown that HCM-causing mutations in the
myosin motor domain disrupt intramolecular interactions that stabilize a folded-back, off state of myosin. This
results in an increase in the number of heads functionally accessible to interact with actin, which in turn may
lead to hypercontractility. In this proposal, the effects of HCM-causing point mutations in different regions of
human β-cardiac myosin will be explored, including the motor domain and both the proximal and distal portions
of the alpha-helical coiled coil tail that allows myosin to form bipolar thick filaments. The interaction of myosin
with MyBPC has also been implicated in regulation of the folded-back state of myosin. The effects of potential
physiological regulators of this interaction, including phosphorylation and calcium binding, will be assessed
using binding and functional assays. The effects of point mutations in different regions of myosin and in
different domains of MyBPC will also be determined. Finally, a variety of structural approaches will be
employed to determine the structure of the folded-back state of myosin in the absence and presence of
MyBPC. Both negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to study the folded-back form of myosin
and the myosin-MyBPC complex, and this work will be supplemented by cross-linking mass spectrometry to
define interfacial residues. FRET probes will be placed on the human β-cardiac myosin to observe its transition
between the on-and-off states. This measurement will be critical in the HCM mutant myosins which have been
shown to disrupt the off-state of myosin. Transient time-resolved FRET measurements will enable us to
measure the nanosecond dynamics of myosin as it undergoes the on-to-off transition. Thus, we will use this
more complex reconstituted system and an array of assays to determine the role of β-cardiac myosin and
MyBPC on the sequestration of myosin heads under physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
10767856,"Like many states across the country, COVID-19 cases and deaths have impacted communities of color in
Michigan at disproportionately higher rates than whites. A staggering reality is that while African Americans
(AA) represent only 13.6% of Michigan’s population, they represent 40% of the deaths from COVID-19. Half of
the cases and deaths in Michigan occurred in Wayne County. Other Counties in the lower half of Michigan
have similar disparities including Genesee, Washtenaw, and Kent. In Genesee County, where African
Americans represent 20.3% of the population, they represent 35% of COVID-19 cases and 45% of deaths. In
Washtenaw County, nearly half of the cases to date are located in two majority low-income zip codes in the city
of Ypsilanti. African American residents, who make up 12% of the Washtenaw population, disproportionately
constitute more than a quarter of the cases. And in Kent County, while 10.8% of the population is Latinx (LX),
this ethnic group makes up 32.4% of COVID-19 cases. It is unquestionable that this crisis has exacerbated
existing racial/ethnic inequity and health disparities in Michigan. Preliminary data from the state reveal that
these disparities will likely worsen due to significant hesitancy, fear, mistrust and misinformation regarding the
COVID-19 vaccine if nothing is done to change current trends. This proposal, entitled Community-Centered
Interventions for Improved Vaccine Uptake for COVID (CIVIC), is designed to directly address and decrease
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake among populations that experience COVID-19
related disparities. We will focus on the four counties within Michigan where a disproportionate burden of
COVID-19 is within AA and LX communities, i.e., Wayne, Genesee, Kent and Washtenaw Counties. Using a
community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, CIVIC will leverage: its long term relationships
with the communities involved, an established CBPR Steering Committee developed and the knowledge
gained as a Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) grant recipient, the resources and networks of the
University of Michigan CTSA (MICHR), and the expertise of our academic partners to identify and understand
factors that contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in AA and LX communities in Michigan. We will develop
and test interventions based on community-centered approaches to achieve a primary goal of increased
vaccine uptake. We will achieve this goal with the following aims: 1: Increase understanding of the barriers
and drivers of vaccine uptake and hesitancy; 2: Increase vaccine uptake and decrease vaccine hesitancy
through the implementation and evaluation of a multilevel intervention; 3: Increase vaccine uptake and
decrease vaccine hesitancy through the implementation and evaluation of an individual level tailored
intervention; and 4: Maintain, enhance, and evaluate the effectiveness of the CIVIC partnership to equitably
engage all partners."
10792466,"ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy, the predominant treatment for head and neck cancers, causes irreversible damage to
the salivary glands, due to the loss of secretory acinar cells. Recent data from our laboratory
demonstrates that human and murine salivary glands initiate acinar cell regeneration after radiation
treatment, but in contrast to injury by duct ligation, the salivary glands do not fully recover function.
However, the regenerative potential exhibited in irradiated glands implies that therapeutic strategies may
be developed to stimulate repair of radiation-induced damage. Emerging evidence suggests that cell
plasticity, defined as the ability of differentiated cells to re-enter the cell cycle, is a means of supplying
precursors for tissue regeneration. Evidence of cell plasticity has only recently been reported in salivary
glands. In studies of glands injured by duct ligation or ionizing radiation, we have identified three specific
cell populations that display plasticity. These include surviving regenerative cells that can repopulate
duct-ligated glands, a heterogeneous population of cells co-expressing duct and acinar cell markers with
unknown fate, and duct cells that can undergo lineage conversion to generate secretory acinar cells in
irradiated glands. Cellular plasticity, and the ability to convert cells from another lineage in vivo, offer
considerable potential for replacement of lost acinar cells. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms
that induce, regulate, and constrain this process is limited. We propose to compare different injury
models, for the response of salivary gland cells, and to define the conditions that induce plasticity.
Lineage tracing, which heritably labels cells and their descendants, will be used to investigate how cells
exhibiting plasticity contribute to regeneration, and the requirements for those cells to undergo lineage
conversion. Single cell RNA sequencing will be used to characterize the cell types involved in
regeneration, and gain insight into participating molecular pathways. The feasibility of stimulating
regeneration of endogenous cells through the introduction of exogenous factors will be explored. These
studies will determine how cellular plasticity and lineage conversion are involved in the response to injury
and regeneration of the salivary glands. Identification of the cells involved and the conditions driving
these processes may yield critical information for development of regenerative approaches to treat
xerostomia."

Support for developmental research projects are a key SPORE element and are vital for
fostering pioneering initiatives. As such, we will support 3 developmental research projects with
budgets of approximately $50,000 each per year. The principal goal of the Developmental
Research Program (DRP) is to support highly innovative radiation therapy related cancer
research with high potential for translational impact, allowing investigators the ability to
obtain key preliminary data for submission of an R01 application or an equivalent
proposal (e.g. project in future SPORE application). A maximum of two years of support will be
possible; however, the expectation is that funds will support most projects for one year, with
10-15 new projects supported during the five-year period of the grant. Projects will be solicited
from University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center investigators and other University of Michigan
faculty by campus-wide announcements and a standing advertisement for the Program at the
Cancer Center and institutional websites listing other developmental research opportunities.
Applications will utilize an NIH format, with a 5-page limit on the body of the application (e.g.
excluding references, detailed protocol information, appendix materials). Drs. Eric Fearon and
Theodore Lawrence will serve as Co-Directors of the DRP. The Cancer Research
Committee of the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center will undertake initial review,
evaluating each proposal’s scientific merit, innovation, relevance to the theme of
radiosensitization of locally advanced cancers and potential for translational impact. Given
the Cancer Research Committee’s rapid and successful annual review of more than 100 pilot
research proposals yearly in laboratory, clinical, and population-based research, the
Committee is well-suited for the initial review process. After initial review, the SPORE’s
Operations Committee will utilize assigned merit scores as a principal, but not sole, criterion in the
selection of proposals for support. Developmental research project investigators will take part in
all SPORE activities. Drs. Fearon or Lawrence will join mentoring committees set up for each
project PI to offer in-depth review and mentorship."
10768571,"There is a notably high incidence of breast cancer among younger military women (20% to 40% higher).
The incident rate of breast cancer for active duty women is seven times higher than the average incident
rate of fifteen other cancer types across all service members. An estimated 90% of deaths due to breast
cancer are a consequence of metastatic disease. Thus, metastasis is a formidable and clearly an unmet
challenge. We identified that NMI (N-Myc Interactor) protein is undetectable in more than 60% of primary
breast tumors that had undergone metastatic dissemination. To recapitulate this clinical scenario, we
generated a mammary specific-NMI knockout (Nmi-KO) mouse. In this model, we deciphered that loss of
NMI allows for unrestrained signaling through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and enables mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of mammary tumors cells leading to increased metastasis. We found that NMI protein loss
is observed predominantly in triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). TNBC is inherently highly invasive and
metastatic and is recognized for aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. While investigating cellular
adaptations of TNBC to low doses of a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, iCRT14, we observed that iCRT14 clearly
decreased the number of nucleoli per TNBC cell.
The nucleolus is the primary site of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) synthesis and assembly with ribosomal
proteins. It is a vital component in the ability of a cancer cell to meet the dynamic metabolic demands of
tumor progression. Classical pathologic diagnosis of tumor tissue has revealed that nucleolar hypertrophy
and increased nucleolar number are predictive and prognostic parameters of increased mortality. Our
observations reveal that TNBCs show increased number of nucleoli per cell compared to non-TNBC
specimens. Despite the importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, there is a clear gap in knowledge about the
relevance of this pathway to nucleolar functions, specifically in TNBCs. We hypothesize that TNBCs are
`addicted to' elevated ribosome biogenesis. Our proposed investigations are designed to test if inhibition of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling will be an effective approach to disable ribosome biogenesis of TNBCs, specifically
in those that lack NMI expression.
While Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been one of the major factors driving TNBC metastases, therapeutic
strategies are still evolving. Our research efforts will advance this field and unravel critical information that
identifies the novel drug targets. Overall our efforts are congruent with the mission of the VA women's
health initiative."
10767841,"Discharged members of the US Armed Services are at an increased risk of metabolic disease which is
exemplified by the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affecting an estimated 1/3 of all VHA
patients. A key defect in the etiology of T2DM is the inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production,
or hepatic insulin resistance. Alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism precede hepatic insulin resistance and are
regulated largely by mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (β-oxidation) and, in particular, the ability to maintain
effective metabolic flexibility under different dietary states. Previous work has implicated mechanistic target of
rapamycin (mTOR) as a mediator of this process through the regulation of β-oxidation. However, our
preliminary work found an interesting dichotomy; inhibition of mTOR promotes β-oxidation of fatty acids when
there is a prevalence of saturated fatty acids substrates available but in contrast impairs β-oxidation when
unsaturated fatty acids are the primary dietary lipid sources. That is, unsaturated fatty acid catabolism by β-
oxidation is not complete in the context of low mTOR singaling. β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids requires
accessory enzymes to desaturate for use as mitochondrial substrates. Because the development of insulin
resistance is linked to dysregulation in metabolic flexibility, we propose that mTOR-mediated regulation of this
process is a key to maintaining hepatic insulin sensitivity and preventing metabolic disease.
 The long-term goal of this proposal is define a relationship that could be central to the development of
hepatic insulin resistance. This metabolic dysfunction is highly prevalent among Veterans and is a significant
long-term healthcare issue due to increased risk of developing additional pathologies associated with this
condition, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment and prevention
options will significantly reduce the health burden of Veteran patients as well as Veterans Health
Administration costs associated with treatment. Our overall hypothesis is that mTOR regulates the response to
dietary fatty acids through its regulation of β-oxidation accessory enzymes and that dysfunction in this pathway
leads to hepatic insulin resistance. Our rationale for this study is that understanding how this pathway
regulates nutrient usage under metabolic stress will serve as a means to define new therapeutic targets to be
utilized for treatment and prevention of metabolic disease in Veterans.
 We test this hypothesis using both pharmaceutical and genetic manipulation of mTOR signaling and the
rate limiting β-oxidation accessory enzyme 2,4 Dieonyl-CoA reductase (DECR1) in primary hepatocytes and
mouse models in experimental aims that link this pathway with mitochondrial energetic function and
metabolism. In aim 1, we test whether mTOR signaling has direct impact on the activity of DECR1 with a
functional outcome on fat oxidation. In aim 2, we then test whether β-oxidation accessory enzymes in mice
play a significant role in the development of hepatic insulin signaling under metabolic stress using a novel
DECR1 knockout mouse model. In particular, we test the metabolic and mitochondrial response to metabolic
stress from changing dietary sources of fat. In aim 3, we address remodeling of the hepatic mitochondria as a
homeostatic mechanism to maintain metabolic flexibility and the potential role of β-oxidation accessory
enzymes in this process.
 Hepatic insulin resistance is promoted by several factors including diet, genetics and liver pathology. By
clarifying a central pathway in the process through mTOR and β-oxidation accessory enzymes, our approach
will lead to breakthrough discoveries that will significantly enhance health research to help our Veterans."
10912442,"Trauma is responsible for 180,000 deaths annually in the United States and accounts for 59% of deaths in the
population younger than 45 years. 86% of preventable deaths are related to sequalae of massive torso
hemorrhage. Rapid precision diagnostic tools are needed to triage patients for early activation of massive
transfusion protocols and urgent surgical or angiographic hemostatic intervention to circumvent the vicious
cycle of acidosis, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and death resulting from exsanguination. Whole-body CT
angiography (WBCTA) is the workhorse screening and surgical planning modality for torso hemorrhage. Lethal
but preventable hemorrhage typically arises from pelvic fractures and solid organ lacerations, manifesting on
WBCTA as foci of contrast extravasation and pooled cavitary hemorrhage (e.g., pelvic hematoma, hemothorax,
or hemoperitoneum). Rapid assessment of WBCTA can result in earlier intervention, with associated survival
benefit, but reader fatigue, study volume, reading room distractions, and injuries involving multiple body
regions remain sources of diagnostic error and interpretation delays. Assessment of organ injury severity,
pelvic fracture severity, and overall hemorrhage burden remains reader dependent and subjective. Clinical
tools including the Shock Index have many confounders that impede forecasting of actionable hemorrhage-
related outcomes. Automated WBCTA computer aided diagnosis (CADx) tools that detect bleeding pelvic
fractures and organ lacerations, classify severity grade, and deliver precise voxelwise volumetric
measurements of multicavitary hemorrhage burden will greatly accelerate and standardize image analysis,
reduce turnaround time for reporting of critical results, improve the accuracy and objectivity of clinical decision
making, and ultimately reduce time to life-saving hemorrhage control interventions. To capitalize on the
benefits of automated point-of-care CT-based CADx tools in the fast-paced, and safety critical trauma care
setting, such tools must be rapid, accurate, generalizable, and elicit a high level of end-user trust. To minimize
bias, ensure clinical utility, and maximize robustness for turn-key deployment in future multicenter clinical trials,
the tools must scale to large diverse populations, and achieve human factors engineering goals established
through expert target user input. Our team will bring to bear combined technical and clinical expertise in trauma
radiology, medical image processing, and human-centered software design to create an orchestrated suite of
rapid, accurate, clinically relevant, and user-centered CADx tools for torso hemorrhage. In Aim 1, we will curate
and annotate a uniquely large dataset of consecutively selected admission trauma WBCTAs. In Aim 2, we will
use this big data approach and human-centered design principles to develop a suite of interactive high-trust
CADx tools. In Aim 3, we will assess generalizability with a large out-of-sample dataset and assess user
acceptance with simulated deployment. The work will result in rapid, robust, and human-centered CADx tools
for detection, precision diagnostics, and personalized decision support for hemorrhage-control interventions."
10805374,"Neuromodulatory nuclei detect and transform brain network activity into simpler signals, then send
neurotransmitters back out to large-scale brain networks to change their function. Such nuclei are centrally
implicated in mental disorders and adaptive resilience, and their regulation remains an untapped resource for
interventions. The purpose of this grant is to understand how neuromodulatory nuclei detect and in turn
influence distributed patterns of brain activity to impact behavior. To understand their regulation and effects on
brain function, the investigative team has developed novel neuroimaging, behavioral, and analytic methods.
These methods include: training participants to endogenously self-regulate dopaminergic midbrain, isolating
distinct streams of information in the midbrain over multiple timescales, distinguishing behavioral contexts and
network effects associated with univariate activation in neuromodulatory nuclei, and finally relating midbrain
activation to memory-conducive states in medial temporal lobe memory systems. Our team has recently
developed whole-brain analyses of real-time fMRI during midbrain neurofeedback and machine-learning tools
for characterizing nonlinear latent dynamics from high-dimensional data. Now, with these tools, we can relate
midbrain activation to whole brain states. We hypothesize 1) that distinct distributed spatiotemporal patterns
precede and follow midbrain univariate activation, specify it uniquely among neuromodulatory nuclei, and
distinguish sustained from transient midbrain responses; 2) that the evolution of these patterns over the
training session will predict learning to upregulate midbrain, and 3) that endogenous midbrain regulation will
predict brain and behavioral effects we and others have previously shown to be associated with midbrain
activation and dopamine function. If the aims of this project are achieved, we will have introduced a multi-level
model of the neural states that support midbrain activation, a complement of methods for regulating midbrain
noninvasively, and an improved understanding of its impact on learning and motivated behavior. Reliable
cognitive strategies for dynamically and selectively fine-tuning neural networks to suit behavioral contexts will
lay the foundation for a wide array of interventions across educational and clinical applications."
10799716,"Abstract
Derangements in airway branching morphogenesis caused by prenatal exposures can have lifelong adverse
impact on lung function and increase risks for many major respiratory diseases. Adverse effects of prenatal
exposures to alcohol and nicotine are well demonstrated, but the impact of environmental exposures on fetal
airway development is less understood. Exposures to heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As)
are linked to compromised lung health in children and adults. Cd and As cross the placental barrier and are
detected ubiquitously in pregnant women, newborns, and children. They are a major public health concern at
the US population level, punctuated by alarmingly high exposures in specific communities. Because prenatal
exposures to Cd and As are widespread and can have long-term effects on respiratory function, disease risks
and prognosis, studies addressing the mechanisms of Cd and As impacting airway development are of urgent
and fundamental importance. This application focuses on a novel yet central metabolic pathway, pyrimidine
synthesis, found to drive defects in airway branching morphogenesis by our prior research. Pyrimidines are
precursors for DNA and RNA synthesis, protein modification and lipid production, and play major regulatory
roles in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. We hypothesize that dysregulation of de novo
biosynthesis of pyrimidines is a critical factor contributing to abnormal airway development and
growth. Pyrimidine synthesis is directed by multiple regulatory mechanisms, many susceptible to disruption by
heavy metals; the tight control of this pathway is essential to balance between compromised lung development
and cancer risk. We will capitalize on established experimental models and use a quantitative and systematic
approach, leveraging metabolomics and fluxomics for quantification of affected metabolic flux, linking single-
cell transcriptional network variations to the metabolic impact, and evaluating pathological phenotypes with
quantitative assessment of airway structure and function. Aim 1 will focus on Cd and As effects on DNA and
RNA synthesis as direct output of pyrimidine synthesis and establish a quantitative foundation for studying cell
proliferation controlled by nucleic acid precursor availabilities. Aim 2 will focus on proteoglycans, an important
mediator of growth factor signaling, which require the pyrimidine, uracil and its products, UDP-sugars for
biosynthesis. We will take an innovative approach to investigate the interactions of cell-type specific
transcriptional activities and metabolic signals in the form of complex and dynamic networks. Aim 3 will focus
on synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in early airway development, the most important component of cell
membrane bilayers, which require CTP, and its product CDP-choline as the precursors. Finally, Aim 4 will
determine early postnatal lung structure and function to provide information for future translational research on
early indicators of Cd and As induced airway developmental abnormalities."
10772067,"Our laboratory has been engaged in elucidating mechanisms of asthma pathogenesis for over two decades.
These efforts resulted in the discovery of GATA-3 as the key molecular regulator of development of Th2 cells
that promote allergic airway disease. Since our initial discovery, GATA-3 was successfully targeted in allergen-
induced mild asthma in humans. While Th2-driven mild asthma is well recognized and therapeutically
manageable with inhaled corticosteroids (CS), 5-10% of asthma is clinically deemed severe and these patients
poorly respond to CS, even when used in large doses. To address this issue of disease heterogeneity and
identify the underlying mechanisms, we have studied the airway immune cells of severe asthma (SA) patients
using various tools of immunology and molecular biology including a high dimensional multi-omics approach.
Side-by-side we have used new mouse models of SA established in our laboratory to validate potential targets
for therapeutic intervention in vivo. These studies have led to another original and unexpected finding of a high
IFN-g response (Type 1/T1 response) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) T cells in a subset of SA patients, a
large fraction of these T cells having features of tissue resident memory T cells (TRMs). A T1high immune
response is increasingly being appreciated in SA in both children and adults in independent studies
challenging the belief that IFN-g is always protective in asthma since it cross-regulates a T2 immune response.
We have also identified a deleterious feed forward positive loop induced by CS due to co-operation between
STAT1, downstream of IFN-g, and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that would cause unremitting IFN-g
production in the airways. The ramifications of unremitting IFN-g production can be profound and damaging
given its potential to induce cellular senescence. Intimately associated with the T1high immune response is also
cellular metabolism since mitochondrial dysfunction results in high levels of IFN-g production. Emerging
literature provides strong evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells resulting in senescence and
inflammaging. While replicative senescence and inflammaging are typically associated with old age, the notion
of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) causing premature aging and decline is being entertained in
lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Since IFN-g can induce senescence in surrounding cells, the driver of SIPS may be inflammatory immune
cells, especially T1high TRMs. The key goal of the proposed research program is to interrogate lung and
peripheral blood immune cells and lipids in the BAL fluid of patients to identify mechanisms that induce a CS-
refractory inflammatory phenotype in SA. We believe our studies would identify novel therapeutic targets to
prevent SIPS in SA which may have relevance in other lung diseases. The long-term funding and flexibility of
the R35 mechanism will help me to continue to train a new generation of scientists interested in studying
immune dysfunction to develop novel therapies for recalcitrant chronic lung diseases that can induce SIPS."
10760275,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most devastating blood cancers, and it affects around one million people and
results in 147,000 deaths per year worldwide. AML is characterized by the abnormal production of myeloid lineage of blood
cells and the rapid growth of leukemia blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood. AML is a very aggressive cancer, and
it progresses rapidly and AML patients become fatal within weeks to months. Currently, therapeutic options for AML are
very limited. Only about 35% of AML patients under 60 years-old and 10% over 60 years-old benefit from standard
chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet medical need to develop new therapeutic approaches particularly
combination therapies with advanced efficacy and reduced toxicity for AML patients. Our long-term goals of the proposed
research are to study abnormal vitamin pathways as metabolic dependencies in AML, to investigate critical regulators of
vitamin pathways in supporting AML cell aberrant proliferation, and to identify druggable therapeutic targets in AML. We
have recently uncovered vitamin B6 pathway as a novel dependency in AML. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that
vitamin B6 pathway is a specific anti-leukemia target and has promising therapeutic potential to treat AML. To assess the
hypothesis, we have identified multiple key enzymes in vitamin B6 dependent metabolic pathways essential for AML cell,
but not for normal bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell and immune cell, proliferation. Depletion of these
key enzymes exhibited robust inhibition on AML proliferation. We have also validated vitamin B6 pathway as a
pharmacologically actionable pathway and showed that vitamin B6 pathway inhibitors exhibit promising therapeutic
efficacy in multiple genetically engineered AML models in vivo. These robust preliminary data encourage us to pursue three
Specific Aims to further characterize vitamin B6 pathway: 1) to characterize both upstream and downstream regulators of
vitamin B6 pathway in AML; 2) to evaluate the synergy between vitamin B6 pathway and BCL-2 in AML therapeutics to
further enhance its efficacy; and 3) to perform functional genomics screens to identify vitamin B6 pathway synergistic
effectors in AML. We propose to study AML from the aspect of vitamin B6 pathway and metabolic programming, a process
which is novel and essential for AML cell proliferation. The proposed research will be focusing on both mechanistic
understanding and therapeutic targeting of vitamin B6 pathway in association with different synergistic effectors in AML.
The major goals of this proposal are to identify the unique vitamin B6 upstream regulators and downstream effectors as
well as its synergistic effectors to treat AML. The proposal is significant because it will not only uncover the underlying
mechanism but also pinpoint therapeutic targets to synergistically enhance the anti-leukemia effects in AML."
10767811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sensory experience sculpts neural circuits over the course of postnatal development and throughout life. A key question in
developmental neurobiology is how sensory-driven neuronal activity cooperates with intrinsic gene expression programs to
assemble functional neural circuits during development. While this question is relatively well-studied in central neural
circuits, the role sensory activity plays in regulating gene expression in primary sensory neurons remains poorly understood.
I propose to address this question in the somatosensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
Sensory experience has long been known to exert a profound effect on the development and function of mammalian sensory
systems such as the visual and auditory systems. Likewise, sensory experience has long been presumed to regulate the
wiring and function of somatosensory circuits, but only limited suggestive evidence supports such presumptions. Our lab
has produced genetic tools that enable visualization and functional manipulation of the major light touch-detecting DRG
neuron subtypes in the mouse and recently discovered that disrupting sensory activity changes gene expression programs in
these neurons. However, the ways in which sensory activity shapes the gene expression programs that dictate DRG neuron
development and function have not been characterized.
Aim 1 features joint chromatin-RNA single-nucleus sequencing approaches to describe the DRG neuron gene regulatory
landscape across development. Aim 2 uses a combination of the same sequencing approaches and a somatosensory
stimulation paradigm to describe how sensory activity establishes DRG neuron subtype-specific gene expression programs.
Aim 3 uses mouse genetic tools and physiological and morphological analyses to determine the role of mechanosensation
in development of DRG sensory neuron functional properties. Together, these aims will begin to reveal how sensory activity
shapes the gene expression programs that dictate DRG neuron development and function, and such findings will inform the
study of DRG neuron malfunctions in peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy."
10792883,"Ubiquitylation is a covalent posttranslational modification that influences a tremendous number of normal
and disease-related cellular functions. The neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4
enzyme (Nedd4) is the founding member of a family of HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate proteostasis
in various conditions including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to its importance in cancer,
Nedd4 has also recently emerged as a significant regulator of a-synuclein proteotoxicity, and may be a target
for treating synucleinopathies, neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of aggregated
forms of the protein a-synuclein in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the brain. NAB2 is an N-
arylbenzimidazole small molecule discovered from phenotypic screening that reverses a-synuclein associated
toxicity in cellular models of a-synuclein-associated PD, including ER-to-Golgi trafficking disruption. Recently we
elucidated the mode of action of NAB2, finding that it bound tightly to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (Kdapp = 42
nM) and expands the substrate specificity of Nedd4. We determined that NAB2 binding to Nedd4 triggers the
ubiquitylation of new substrates, such as the trafficking-associated proteins such as TFG, TRAPP1 subunits,
and RER1. We hypothesize that Nedd4 signaling influences a new pathway that regulates trafficking processes
in response to
a-synuclein-associated toxicity. The proteoform state of Nedd4 that responds to a-synuclein
toxicity and binds NAB2 is also not known. In addition, the location of the NAB2 binding site within Nedd4 also
is not known. In this proposal we wish to test the hypothesis that NAB2 acts on Nedd4 alone or as ‘molecular
glue’ to facilitate communication between Nedd4 and potential substrates. We wish to understand how NAB2
interacts with NEDD4, and how this interaction affords Nedd4 a gain of function activity to ubiquitin modifiy non
PxY-containing substrates like TFG. If successful, these studies will better illuminate the role Nedd4 plays in
proteotoxicity signaling. In addition, the degree to which Nedd4 activity can be modulated by small molecules is
important, given the important role Nedd4 ubiquitination plays in cancer pathobiology and neurodegenerative
disorders. These studies will hopefully add to our fundamental knowledge of the role that E3 ligases play in
proteotoxicity signaling, and may inspire the future discovery and development of therapeutics that may address
some of the causes of synucleinopathies."

To maintain health, the host must avoid generating inflammatory responses to beneficial gut bacteria, while
retaining the ability to respond to pathogens. Maintaining this balance is particularly complicated in early life as
many of the mechanisms that serve to promote tolerance to resident commensal microbes in adults are either
absent or not yet established during this period. We recently identified maternal antibodies as key regulators of
host-microbiota mutualism in neonates. Specifically, we found that in addition to IgA, healthy mothers generate
microbiota-reactive IgG antibodies, which are transmitted via breastmilk and coat bacteria in the neonatal gut. In
comparison with control offspring, neonates that do not receive these maternal isotypes harbor increased
numbers of commensal bacteria in gut draining lymph nodes, mount inappropriate, microbiota-driven CD4 T-
dependent immune responses, and suffer increased morbidity when subjected to a chemical form of colitis.
Building from these exciting findings, this proposal seeks to understand the mechanisms by which maternal
antibodies regulate nascent host-microbiota interactions in neonates. Specifically, we will determine the antigen
specificities and the effector mechanisms (e.g., complement activation or Fc receptor ligation) required for
distinct maternal IgG isotypes to restrain neonatal adaptive immune responses to beneficial gut bacteria.
Additionally, we will define the signaling pathways and cell types required to trigger dysregulated adaptive
immune responses in offspring that do not receive breastmilk antibodies. We will employ innovative approaches
to achieve these goals by leveraging fostering and optimized infant feeding approaches with transgenic mouse
models and multi-parameter flow cytometry. These studies are significant because they address key gaps in our
knowledge regarding how favorable relationships between the host and resident microbiota are established in
early life. Additionally, our work will also advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which breastfeeding
promotes health. We expect that the insight gained from this research will significantly aid in our ability to
manipulate host-microbiota interactions and mucosal immunity during early life, regardless of mode of nutrition."

10766251,"Our goal is to investigate overexpression of the T-lineage transcription factor (TF) BCL11B as a novel strategy
to enhance: 1) T-cell reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and 2) the
efficacy of anticancer chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells. HSCT is a curative therapy for many leukemias
by itself or as a post-CAR consolidation therapy. However, the generation of T-cells from donor hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) takes many months making life threatening infections and leukemia relapse
major challenges in HSCT. While CAR T-cells induce high remission rates in CD19+ leukemias, poor T-cell
function and persistence and T-cell exhaustion due to inhibition by the tumor microenvironment remain major
obstacles to the curative efficacy of CAR T-cells in leukemia and solid tumors. Species related differences in the
regulation of T-cell differentiation by TF and the poor understanding of mechanisms in human T-cell
differentiation have been hurdles to the development of approaches to enhance T-cell differentiation and
function. The tumor suppressor TF Bcl11b is required for the repression of alternative (non-T) lineage potentials
but does not play a role in the induction of T-lineage gene expression during the initial stages of T-cell
differentiation of murine HSPC. In contrast, we showed that BCL11B is critical for both the induction of the T-
lineage program and repression of alternative lineage programs during the initial stages of human T-cell
differentiation. We now have novel preliminary in vitro data that lentiviral BCL11B overexpression: 1) expedites
T-cell differentiation from human HSPC including the generation of mature T-cells, and 2) enhances the function,
promotes differentiation into cells with a central memory phenotype, and delays exhaustion of human T-cells.
Integrated analysis of functional, Chip-Seq, and single cell RNA-Seq data revealed NOTCH3 and IRF8 as
species specific candidate targets of BCL11B in humans. Of note, BCL11B overexpression studies have not
been possible in murine HSPC due to toxicity. Based on these data, we hypothesize that transplantation of HSPC
engineered to overexpress BCL11B will enhance post-HSCT T-cell reconstitution. BCL11B overexpression will
increase the efficacy of CAR T-cells by enhancing their function and persistence and ameliorating exhaustion.
We will test the hypothesis through the following aims: 1.1) Determine the epigenetic effects of BCL11B on T-
cell genes and the role of BCL11B mediated regulation of NOTCH3 (1.2) and IRF8 (1.3) in human T-cell
differentiation. 1.4) Define the efficacy of BCL11B overexpressing human HSPC for the enhancement of post-
HSCT T-cell reconstitution in humanized mouse models, and 2) Define the effects of BCL11B overexpression
on anti-cancer efficacy, persistence, and exhaustion of human CAR T-cells in leukemia and neuroblastoma
models. These studies could reveal new functions of BCL11B and lead to BCL11B engineered cell therapies
that improve outcomes in leukemia and solid tumors. This proposal is innovative because it builds on our work
defining species specific effects of BCL11B in humans to address key barriers in HSCT and CAR T-cell therapy."
10798150,"Most men who have sex with men (MSM) do not receive gonorrhea testing, contributing to delayed treatment
and potentially amplifying antimicrobial resistance. Poor test uptake is often related to costs associated with
STD testing and minimal community engagement. We have developed a pay-it-forward intervention to
enhance gonorrhea testing among MSM. Pay-it-forward involves an individual receiving a gift (in this case, a
gonorrhea test) and then be provided the opportunity to give a gift (in this case, money to support gonorrhea
testing) to another person. Pay-it-forward is an example of upstream reciprocity theory suggesting that people
who are helped by someone feel a “warm glow” that makes them more likely to help others. Pay-it-forward has
been used to encourage people to donate something to another person. But in this study, we will test the
effectiveness of two levels of implementation strategies based on upstream reciprocity to motivate gift
recipients to get tested for gonorrhea. Specifically, we will compare a standard pay-it-forward implementation
strategy with minimal encouragement to get tested and a community-engaged pay-it-forward strategy
alongside a control arm in which men pay for their own STD test. Our pilot randomized controlled trial in two
cities found that pay-it-forward substantially increased gonorrhea testing compared to the control arm (56% in
the pay-it-forward arm, 18% in control arm). Our pilot data also suggests that greater MSM community
engagement (e.g., MSM participatory activities to create testing messages) increases donations to the
program, reinforcing the hypothesis that a community-engaged implementation strategy can activate upstream
reciprocity. Intensified testing could also decrease antibiotic resistance. Building on our UNC Project-China
research infrastructure in China, we propose the Pay-It-forward gONorrhEa tEsting RCT (PIONEER). The
study has the following specific aims: (1) to use a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial to compare
gonorrhea testing uptake in a standard pay-it-forward strategy arm, a community-engaged pay-it-forward
strategy arm, and a control arm reflecting current practice; (2) to determine mechanisms through which
different pay-it-forward strategies activate upstream reciprocity to influence gonorrhea testing and donations;
(3) to examine the impact of enhanced gonorrhea testing on the development of gonorrhea resistance. Based
on our prior work, we hypothesize that a community-engaged pay-it-forward strategy will increase gonorrhea
test uptake rates compared to the standard strategy, and that pay-it-forward in general is superior to the
current practice of paid testing. Our proposal is innovative because it provides a new financing mechanism to
support gonorrhea testing, tests implementation strategies to enhance the effectiveness of this mechanism,
and will provide more detailed information about the relationship between increasing testing and the
development of antimicrobial resistance. This proposal has significant public health implications for the delivery
of sexual minority health services in low and middle-income countries and is aligned with the mission of NIAID."
10817154,"The goal of this proposal is to define the role of each component of the ARTN/GFR3/TRPM8 signaling pathway
in radiation-associated pain (RAP). A common consequence of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) is
acute orofacial RAP. This pain is often severe, and difficult to control with current analgesics. Control of RAP
relies on opioids in >80% of these cases. These drugs are not fully effective in most patients, and 6 months after
finishing radiotherapy, one-third of HNC patients will still be opioid-dependent. There is an urgent need to identify
safer, more effective, and less addictive pain relief strategies for HNC patients undergoing therapeutic irradiation.
Addressing this need is prevented by a critical gap in our knowledge: the molecular and cellular mechanisms
that drive acute orofacial RAP are unknown. In a mouse model of RAP, our preliminary data have indicated that
a critical component of acute orofacial RAP is a signaling pathway which is usually identified as a “cold pain”
pathway. The hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that locally irradiated tissues generate extreme pain via
a neural circuit that involves the “cold pain” pathway. This signaling pathway is principally mediated by neurons
which express a specific ion channel called TRPM8. A typical mechanism for TRPM8 activation involves release
of artemin (ARTN) from injured tissues; ARTN binds its neuronal receptor, called GFRα3, which in turn activates
TRPM8. The objectives of this grant are: (1) to define the role of TRPM8 in mediating acute orofacial RAP; and
(2) to determine whether ARTN/GFRα3 signaling is required for RAP signaling. We will test the hypothesis and
achieve our objectives with three specific aims (SA): (SA1) to determine whether TRPM8-expressing neurons
are critical to development of acute orofacial RAP; (SA2) to determine whether the GFRα3 receptor activates
TRPM8 signaling in RAP; and (SA3) to determine whether ARTN is a critical activator of TRPM8 (and acute
RAP) after oral irradiation. This contribution is significant because it will advance our understanding of the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive acute orofacial RAP. The results will lay the groundwork for
identification of new targeted treatments that will both improve comfort and reduce opioid-dependency for HNC
patients with RAP. Importantly, if this RAP pathway is conserved between various anatomic sites, our results
may extend well beyond the realm of HNC, and positively impact the analgesic options for patients who undergo
radiotherapy for a wide range of cancers. The proposed research is innovative: there has been no research on
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of RAP, and rather than attempting to alleviate pain by mitigating
inflammation, we will identify strategies for direct inhibition of RAP. Our approach uses sophisticated methods
for tracing neural circuits, and translational relevance is maximized through use of in vivo mouse studies, in vitro
human cell culture experiments, and examination of patient-derived samples. Regardless of whether each
component of our proposed mechanism fits together into a signaling cascade exactly as proposed, our work will
generate novel, relevant information that advances the field toward novel therapies for acute orofacial RAP."

This proposal details a five-year research and career development plan with a scientific focus on
autoimmunity-associated B cells (ABC), a subset of cells that is expanded during lupus disease activity and
can differentiate into autoantibody-producing plasma cells (PC). These cells are found in the kidneys of lupus
nephritis patients.
The long-term objective of the study is to understand signals that regulate the development of ABC and
autoreactive PC in lupus nephritis patients in hopes of identifying new therapeutic targets. Preliminary data
suggest that ABC develop after B cell activation in the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin
21. ABC are hyper-responsive to type III interferon (IFN-λ). PC differentiation can be promoted by IFN-λ in
healthy B cells. In this application, Aim 1 will determine how interferon lambda (IFN-λ) promotes ABC
differentiation to PC by examining epigenetic and gene expression changes in B cells treated with IFN-λ. Aim
2 will define the relationships between ABC and their cellular neighbors in the renal microenvironment. In
particular, the developmental relationship between ABC and other B cells in the kidneys of lupus nephritis
patients will be examined using transcriptomic approaches. A gene expression map of the cellular neighbors
of ABC and PC in the lupus nephritis renal microenvironment will be created using spatial transcriptomic
analysis. This will identify factors that may be promoting the development of autoimmunity in lupus nephritis.
This project will allow Dr. Jennifer Barnas, MD, PhD to develop her skill set in molecular techniques such
epigenomics, spatial and single cell transcriptomics and biostatistical anlaysis of these large data sets under the
mentorship of Dr. Jennifer Anolik, an expert in lupus B cell biology, Dr. Martha Susiarjo, an expert in epigenetic
regulation of disease, and Dr. Andrew McDavid, a computational biologist with extensive experience in single-
cell analysis of immune cells. Dr. Barnas will use these techniques to develop an independent research program
at University of Rochester and apply for NIH R01 funding to study B cell activation pathways and PC development
in autoimmune disease. This work will inform the origin of ABCs and establish whether pathways revealed by in
vitro studies are functioning in clinically relevant tissue samples."

Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, affect millions of people
worldwide and place a considerable burden on both patients and family members. Existing
treatments for these disorders have limited efficacy, in part due the varied clinical
manifestations, and to our narrow understanding of the impacted neural processes, particularly
at the system (i.e., network) level. Two key elements of networks are the underlying
infrastructure or physical connections between elements and the functional signaling between
entities that rides on top of this infrastructure. Recent advancements in noninvasive imaging
have given us the ability to quantify structural and functional relationships in the brain via
diffusion MRI, resting-state functional MRI, respectively. The size and scope of datasets
measuring network structure and function are increasing in neuroimaging, and other domains,
which heightens the need for new statistical frameworks that make full use of the data.
Our goal is to develop frameworks for the analysis of structure-function integration in large-scale
and complex networks, applied to neuroimaging studies, but also broadly applicable. This
proposal will introduce three analytic paradigms: Bayesian network modeling that uses a priori
structure-function knowledge for simultaneous network anomaly detection and clinical severity
prediction; density regression using optimal transport theory; and end-to-end prediction using
deep neural networks. In our application, infrastructure will be measured via dMRI, while
function will be measured rs-fMRI. Each of our frameworks will provide a unique means to
integrate these distinct imaging modalities, while also respecting the unique information
provided by each data type. We also propose a unique software development effort that creates
an application program interface to core software and implementations as software as as a
service hosted on cloud platforms."
10766752,"Salt-sensitive (SS) individuals on high Na+ intake not only develop hypertension but also kidney
injury/ chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). A reduction in Na+
intake may prevent and treat hypertension, CVD, and CKD. However, low Na+ intake may not
always be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension or CVD. A low Na+ intake is associated
with increased risk of hypertension (i.e., inverse salt sensitivity (ISS), CVD, and death.
Hypertension and diabetes are the major causes of renal injury, accounting for up to 75% of
end-stage renal disease. However, hypertension may cause CKD only in the genetically
susceptible. In 13 of 16 studies in the GEO Dataset of CKD patients, dopamine type 2 receptor
(D2R) gene (DRD2) expression is lower in those with CKD than those without CKD. A decrease
in the expression or function of D2R, per se, or caused by DRD2 variants, increases renal
inflammation, renal fibrosis, and ISS. The mechanisms/genetics of ISS are not well understood.
Mice with global germline deletion of Drd2 (Drd2-/-) have SS hypertension and ISS. However,
mice with renal proximal tubule (RPT)-specific conditional deletion of Drd2 (Drd2cPT) have
increased blood pressure (BP) only when Na+ intake is decreased, a case of ISS. Sprague-
Dawley rats have ISS, related to an increase in the activity of the angiotensin type 1 receptor
(AT1R) and α1-adrenoceptors. About 15% of hypertensive subjects have ISS and some
associated with DRD2 rs6276/rs6277. Renal-selective expression of DRD2 variant rs6277 in
mice should increase BP and impair inhibition of renal Na+ transport and excretion. We will test
the overall hypothesis that DRD2/Drd2 is important in preventing ISS by mitigating overly
active renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems and the increase in RPT Na+
transport on a low Na+ diet. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that in Drd2-/- or Drd2cPT
mice, BP increases when Na+ intake is “low”, a case of ISS. The increase in BP in Drd2-/- or
Drd2cPT mice fed a low Na+ diet is caused by impaired D2R inhibition of RPT Na+ transport and
an increase in RPT Na+ transport caused by activation of both the renin-angioten-sin and
sympathetic nervous systems. In the long-term, renal function is decreased because of
unmitigated renal fibrosis. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that DRD2 variants,
rs6276/rs6277, decrease D2R expression that is dependent on the effects of the transcription
factors NR4a2 and miR4301. These studies are significant and important because they may
lead to the identification of the human population that would be adversely affected by the current
recommendation to decrease the Na+ intake in everyone."
10754944,"ABSTRACT
 Sympathetic stimulation of ventricular myocytes activates PKA, which phosphorylates L-type Ca2+
channels and phospholamban, among other substrates, to increase Ca2+ entry and SR Ca2+ uptake. This β-
adrenergic-induced increase of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+ overload) is a natural and efficient mechanism to
increase cardiac performance, inasmuch as the magnitude and force of cardiac contractions greatly depend on
the amount of Ca2+ supplied to the myofilaments. However, Ca2+ overload also increases arrhythmia vulnerability
because it brings ryanodine receptors (RyR2) closer to threshold for spontaneous Ca2+ release (SCR). SCR
during diastole activates the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger of the sarcolemma and generates a depolarizing inward current
(delayed after-depolarization or DAD) that may trigger extemporaneous actions potentials. Ca2+ overload and its
subsequent SCRs are indeed the primary events that evolve in malignant cardiac arrhythmias, as observed in
Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) and quite possibly in some forms of atrial
fibrillation, long QT, and heart failure. To prevent these Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias, an emergent group of RyR2
blockers aim to stop SCR, despite the fact that the key process that spawns SCR, namely, Ca2+ overload, may
not be affected or in some cases may be even exacerbated by the RyR2 blockers. We have found that
imperacalcin, a high-affinity, membrane-permeable selective agonist of RyRs, paradoxically decreases
arrhythmia burden and prevents Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias in animal models of CPVT. We hypothesize that
this unexpected and remarkable anti-arrhythmic effect of imperacalcin is due to a partial and controlled
depletion of SR Ca2+ load, which decreases the propensity of SCR events and thus dissipates the main
arrhythmogenic substrate in CPVT. Our research program will systematically and rigorously test this
hypothesis at the molecular, cellular, whole heart and intact animal levels using established (mouse) and novel
(rabbit) models of CPVT. The first specific aim will determine the defining structural and functional characteristics
that confer to imperacalcin and other members of the calcin family their capacity to permeate membranes and
their anti-arrhythmic properties. In the second aim, we will use native and modified calcins on intact
cardiomyocytes, Langendorff-perfused working hearts and intact animals for a rationalized design of a novel
group of RyR2 ligands capable of preventing Ca2+-triggered arrhythmias. These studies use animal models of
CPVT to develop a novel paradigm for the treatment of Ca2+ overload-generated cardiac arrhythmias; results
may be applied to other cardiomyopathies where controlled unloading of SR Ca2+ may be desirable."

Wearable sensing has the potential to transform health care by alerting users about important information
regarding their health and potential exposure to environmental risks. Some of the most critical barriers to
wearable sensing include the cost, complexity, and reliability. Addressing the first two challenges is particularly
important to prevent exacerbation of a digital divide in health between those who have access to technologies
and the digital literacy to work them and those that do not. A widely deployable sensing platform technology for
improving health and wellness that can equitably reach the population is thus needed. Past successes in point-
of-care and at-home sensing, including lateral flow sensors, have demonstrated that simple, robust designs that
are customizable to different targets can provide significant value and high reliability without the need for
electronic systems. With that motivation, we are developing a spray-on sensor technology to serve as a platform
for custom wearable coatings that can be easily interpreted by a color change upon exposure to tailored target
stimuli. Our encouraging results recently demonstrated a set of proof-of-concept spray-on sensors formulated
with diacetylene-containing amphiphiles that could detect physical stimuli (UV radiation) and different chemical
targets depending on the amphiphile head-group chemistry. In the proposed project, we are initiating an iterative
development approach to understand and enhance the safety and efficacy of our spray-on sensing formulations.
In Aim 1, we will focus our efforts on assessing and improving the mechanical properties of our spray-on coating
formulations for improved resistance to abrasion and washing without impacting their target sensitivity. Success
of this aim will result in a robust coating that can provided reliable sensing throughout conditions experience in
routine daily use. In order to provide an understanding of the biocompatibility of distinct formulations that are to
be applied directly to the skin for sweat analysis, in Aim 2 we will conduct multiple complementary tests for skin
irritation, permeation, and induction of adverse outcome pathways of skin sensitization. Through this aim we will
be able to effectively make risk assessments in order to define appropriate exposure limits and if necessary
utilize alternative formulation strategies for any components of concern. In Aim 3 with the dual intention of
demonstrating the efficacy and reliability of our spray-on approach for different sensing applications, we will
examine distinct spray-on formulations with tailored functional head-group chemistry of the diacetylene-
amphiphiles for implementation of sweat analysis for lead poisoning, breath analysis for acetone (ketosis), and
UV exposure for radiation dosimetry. These three sensor formulations will operate by applying the distinct spray
coating onto the skin, onto a surgical mask, or onto fabric (clothing), respectively. By tuning the sensitivity,
dynamic range, and selectivity of the individual spray-on sensor formulations for their specified target of interest,
these studies will establish this as a novel platform technology for generating spray-on wearable coatings that
are capable of reliably monitoring information important to understanding health and environmental exposure."

Pathologic attributes of cancers, such as histology and tumor growth patterns are not quantitatively assessed
to date. In every cancer type these parameters effect patient outcomes and are included in risk models of
tumor recurrence and overall survival. Algorithms using machine learning and convolutional neural networks
allow us to quantify pathology and develop Pathomics biomarkers. Here, we propose to obtain pathomics
biomarkers of cancer recurrence/progression that enumerate histology growth patterns (HGPs) in clear cell
renal cell cancer (ccRCC). ccRCC is the most common subtype of kidney cancer. In its localized stage, it is
treated by nephrectomy. However, about 30% of patients experience disease progression after surgery and
may benefit from adjuvant treatment. Deciding whether or not treatment is warranted requires identifying
patients who are at a high risk of recurrence. Here, we hypothesize that quantitative biomarkers will improve
the risk assessment of patients with ccRCC and propose to develop computer-generated features of tumor
growth patterns. We previously defined 13 HGPs and demonstrated their ability to predict overall survival in
patients treated for ccRCC. Distinctive features for each HGP will be generated and validated using
frameworks of convolutional neural networks that produce probabilities of expression across cancer regions.
Further, the distribution of probabilities will be used to obtain biomarkers of expression of each HGP. Using
parametric and non-parametric models, HGP-biomarkers will be examined for their association with tumor
stage and local mechanisms of ccRCC progression, such as formation of tumor thrombi, regional lymph node
metastases or invasion into perinephric adipose tissues. The performance of each algorithm in the project will
be evaluated. Altogether, biomarkers developed in this project will provide a starting point to select patients
with ccRCC for adjuvant treatment after surgery."

Dr. Kushel is a Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
and Director of the UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations (CVP). Trained as a general internist and health
services researcher, Dr. Kushel has mentored numerous individuals at various levels of training over the past
decade. She has done this while building a thriving research program focused on aging in vulnerable
populations, with a particular focus on the growing population of older adults experiencing homelessness. She
is currently funded by the NIA to fund the HOPE HOME Study, a cohort study of adults who are 50 and older
and homeless at study entry who her team has been following since enrollment in 2013-2014. During her initial
K24 award period, she received additional NIA funding, including an R01 to examine family relationships in
homeless older adults and an R34 to develop advance care planning materials for formerly homeless older
adults living in permanent supportive housing. She mentored 39 trainees, and published 45 papers, the vast
majority with mentees as first author. With the renewal of her K24 award, she will extend her research program
by adding a focus on sleep in older adults with an experience of homelessness, continue her efforts to mentor
junior investigators who study aging in vulnerable populations, and redouble her efforts to mentor trainees from
backgrounds underrepresented in research.
The overall aims of this K24 renewal proposal are: (1) Using HOPE HOME longitudinal data, examine the
association of individual (e.g. health status), behaviors (e.g. substance use), social (e.g. relationships) and
environmental (e.g. housing status and environment) with poor sleep in older homeless-experienced adults; (2)
Using qualitative methods, examine barriers and facilitators of sleep quality in older-homeless experienced
adults; (3) Using participatory design, develop a toolkit for homeless system and housing providers to promote
sleep in older homeless adults. The mentoring goals of this award include increasing Dr. Kushel’s expertise in
mentoring researchers from groups historically underrepresented in biomedical sciences.
The K24 would insure sufficient time to pursue this next phase in Dr. Kushel's research while protecting time to
devote to mentoring investigators in aging research for vulnerable populations. She has designed
complementary research and mentoring plans to create a synergistic effect of mentoring and research. The
proposed mentoring, research, and career development activities leverage existing infrastructure, resources,
and training initiatives provided by NIH including the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI),
SF Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD), MSTAR, the National Clinician Scholars Program and
several of UCSF’s T32 supported research fellowships including the Primary Care Research and Aging
Research Fellowships."
10745967,"Project Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM), the grade IV glioma, is among the most lethal of human malignancies, distinguished
by prominent vascularity. GBM is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a current median survival of
about 14-16 months, largely due to its high resistance to conventional cytotoxic therapies. Overgrown
vasculature characterizes the tumor microenvironment that fuels GBM progression and induces vascular
niche-mediated therapeutic resistance. However, current anti-vascular therapy that primarily targets pro-
angiogenic factors including VEGF, albeit initially groundbreaking, has encountered major difficulties and
failures in treating most malignant solid tumors including GBM, likely due to insufficient eradication or
functional inhibition of tumor-associated endothelial cells (ECs). Our recent studies suggest that EC
plasticity by genetic reprogramming is a driving force that induces EC resistance to anti-angiogenic and
cytotoxic treatments. Here, our preliminary study by single-cell transcriptome analysis of tumor-associated
ECs reveals that ECs acquire mesenchymal and stemness-like gene signature in a genetically engineered
mouse GBM model. Utilizing human specimens and EC lineage-tracing systems, our studies reveal robust
treatment resistance in GBM-associated ECs. Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that genetic reprogramming
into mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells induces EC chemoresistance through Wnt activation in GBM.
Therefore, we hypothesize that mesenchymal and stemness-like genetic reprogramming in tumor ECs
induces therapy resistance in GBM. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following aims: 1) Define
the molecular mechanism underlying EC plasticity and treatment resistance with a focus on Wnt activation;
2) Determine the in vivo role of c-Met/Wnt-mediated EC plasticity in tumor progression; and 3) Test
experimental therapy that combines EC plasticity inhibition with radio/chemotherapy or anti-angiogenic
therapy in orthotopic mouse GBM models. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide novel
insights into tumor microenvironment-dependent treatment resistance, and may lead to development of a
new therapeutic strategy by targeting endothelial plasticity in cancer."
10931324,"Abstract: Cell motility is required for in situ cancer to form invasive primary prostate cancer (PCa). Inhibiting
motility would intercept formation of invasive cancer. Until now it has not been possible to selectively inhibit
motility. We have discovered a precision acting first-in-class agent, KBU2046. It selectively inhibits motility, has
a wide therapeutic window, has led us to uncover heretofore unknown regulatory pathways, targets those
pathways, performs well in GLP grade IND enabling studies, and opens up new high value innovative concepts
for cancer prevention-interception. Studies support the hypothesis that KBU2046 is an effective cancer
interception agent that operates through a novel mechanism, and that it and the pathways it modulates will have
high potential for inhibiting the development of invasive cancer, which in turn has lethal potential.
 Aim 1. Identify and validate KBU2046’s pharmacologic binding site. In silico, biophysical and biochemical
studies suggest that KBU2046 binds at the protein-protein interface between HSP90β and CDC37 and
selectively decreases binding to Raf1. Using KBU2046-based photo-crosslinkable probes and proteolysis
targeting chimeras (PROTACs), coupled to chemo-proteomic approaches and bioinformatic analysis, studies
will identify and validate KBU2046 binding sites in the cellular milieu.
 Aim 2. Characterize the signaling pathway by which Raf1 regulates the motility of human prostate cells. We
show KBU2046 decreases phosphorylation of ser338 on Raf1’s activation motif, that downstream regulation of
motility is mediated through a novel pathway wherein Raf1 forms a complex with the actin binding protein, L-
plastin (LCP1), while mass spectrometer (MS) proteomic / bioinformatic analysis demonstrates primary effects
on cell motility proteins. Studies will examine this pathway in at risk human prostate cells, will use Raf1
active/inactive constructs, similarly engineer LCP1 constructs, probe signaling through orthogonal analytics,
profile effects on protein signature using MS, and will examine the role of individual pathway members on cell
motility and KBU2046 efficacy.
 Aim 3. Evaluate targeting motiliy in clinically relevant models of human disease. In the RapidCaP transgenic
model, codeletion of Pten and p53 induces in situ→invasive→metastatic PCa. It supports treatment before
versus after development of in situ lesions, allowing us to examine prevention and interception efficacy,
respectively, for inhibiting formation of invasive cancer. Using primary cells from our prostate rapid autopsy
program (RAP), we show mechanistically relevant responsiveness to KBU2046. Primary cells and resultant
organoids provide a unique opportunity to examine efficacy in clinically relevant models. RapidCaP and RAP
tissues will be interrogated at molecular and functional levels to examine effects of KBU2046.
 Impact. Investigators seek to advance the innovative concept that cell motility is an important cancer
prevention-interception target. It has applicability to many cancer types."
10782494,"The objectives of the proposal are to determine, for the first time, how developing meningeal
lymphatic vessels (MLVs) impact neuroimmune communication in early postnatal life, and if MLV-
dependent neuroimmune communication can be harnessed by VEGF-C signaling in young mice
at steady state and in a model of pediatric brain tumor such as medulloblastoma, the most
common tumor affecting children.
 Our previous work and preliminary data show that MLVs develop during early postnatal life,
that their growth requires Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C (VEGF-C) and the VEGF-C co-
receptor Neuropilin2 (Nrp2), and that enhancing MLV growth enables adaptive immune
responses against glioblastoma in the adult. These findings prompt us to investigate mechanims
how MLV-mediated neuroimmune connection establishes and to characterize the transport of
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to CNS-collecting lymph nodes (cLNs) and the MLV-dependent
education of T cells in developing cLNs.
 Experimental approaches to successfully complete this project include new lymphatic-specific
knockout lines, new procedures of three-dimensional whole-head imaging by light sheet
fluorescence microscopy, and unbiased molecular analysis by mass spectrometry and single cell-
RNA sequencing.
 This multidisciplinary study will bring together complementary expertise in the fields of
meningeal lymphatics (Jean-Leon Thomas, Yale), developmental angiogenesis (Anne Eichmann,
Yale), and immunology (Akiko Iwasaki, Yale), with additional advisors in pediatric oncology (Asher
Marks, Director of Yale Pediatric Neuro-Oncology), liquid-chromatography mass spectometry
(Tukiet Lam, Director of Keck MS & Proteomics Resource at Yale), and TCR repertoire analysis
(Le Zhang, Yale Neurology).
 We expect to characterize the development of MLV-dependent neuroimmune communication,
to identify Nrp2 as a new mandatory regulator of MLV sprouting, identify APC subpopulation(s)
required for CNS antigen transport into cLNs, and to determine, as a proof of principle, the
potential of VEGF-C-driven MLV growth to promote early T cell education against abnormal CNS
antigens, with perspectives for the treatment of aggressive pediatric brain tumors."
10814756,"MOUSE BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPING CORE – PROJECT SUMMARY
The COBRE in Neurodevelopmental Disorders Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Core (MBPC) provides
equipment, expertise, and training to NDD investigators integrating mouse behavioral assessment into their
research programs. The core provides support for investigators at all points in their studies, including
consultations on appropriate animal models, husbandry training (genotyping, breeding), designing and running
experiments, data analysis, display, and interpretation. The goal of the MBPC is to maintain and expand the use
of behavior assays with relevance to NDD, provide technical expertise in the use of multiple mouse behavior
paradigms, and remove barriers to entry and provide detailed training for COBRE investigators interested in
using mouse behavior methods in their studies. The MBPC houses an array of behavioral apparatuses that allow
for phenotyping of motor, mood, learning and memory, social, and other NDD-relevant phenotypes. This includes
1) assessment of ambulatory, rearing, and stereotypy behaviors using open fields, locomotor chambers with
multi-level IR-beam arrays, rotorods, and balance beam; 2) multiple anxiety assays (elevated plus, open field,
marble burying, light/dark box) and mood-related tests (sucrose preference, forced swim test, tube test, novelty
preference) and 5-choice serial reaction time testing for impulsivity; 3) assays designed to test working, short,
and long-term memory including Barnes maze, T-maze, fear conditioning, fear potentiated startle, sucrose self-
administration; 4) social assays including social interaction and preference in open field and 3-chamber
variations, USV communication assays for distress and social calls in pups and adults. In addition, the MBPC
proposes to expand offerings to include EEG and telemetry monitoring to provide information on sleep, seizure,
and other physiological measures and advanced behavior analysis using AI-assisted pose estimation and motif
identification. In addition to providing training and access to available equipment, NDD investigators also have
the option for studies to be run by the MBPC animal technician. To achieve the stated objectives, the MBPC will
be composed of three aims as follows: 1) Maintain, expand, and develop behavior assays with relevance to
NDD, 2) Provide access to expert technical assistance to design, conduct, and analyze mouse behavior assays,
and 3) Support and mentor Junior Investigators and CNDD members as they develop and integrate mouse
behavior models into their research programs."
10753568,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing neurons in the hypothalamus are critical regulators of the
neuroendocrine stress response. CRH neurons integrate stress-related neural inputs and, as part of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, induce the release of ACTH and, ultimately, glucocorticoids
(cortisol). The development of CRH neurons is of great biomedical interest, as developmental vulnerabilities of
CRH neurons contribute to stress-associated disorders such as anxiety and depression. It is, therefore, critical
to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating the development of CRH neurons and determine
how developmental changes affect stress response. Using zebrafish, which are genetically accessible and
optically translucent, we found that DSCAML1 deficiency impaired the developmental cell death of CRH
neurons and caused hyperactivation of the HPI axis (the zebrafish analog of the HPA axis). Given that
DSCAML1 is known to mediate intercellular interactions, we hypothesize that proximity-based and synaptic
interactions in CRH neurons trigger developmental cell death, which tunes the activity of the neuroendocrine
stress response system. To test this, we propose the following aims. In Aim 1, we will test whether
proximity-based interactions promote cell death in CRH neurons. Using the live imaging strength of the
zebrafish model, we will examine whether interactions between adjacent CRH neurons promote cell death and
determine how varying levels of DSCAML1 modulate the extent of cell loss. In Aim 2, we will test whether
synaptic interactions affect CRH neuron cell death. Synaptic activity plays an instructive role in neuronal
survival. Given DSCAML1’s known functions in synaptogenesis, we will investigate whether CRH neuron
survival is dependent on neuronal activity and how DSCAML1-mediated synaptogenesis controls the
excitability of CRH neurons. In Aim 3, we will test how DSCAML1 acts within CRH neurons to trigger cell
death and establish HPI-axis activity. Using CRH neuron-specific mutants, we will determine how DSCAML1
functions within CRH neurons and whether DSCAML1’s function in other cell types also contributes to HPI-axis
development. In Aim 4, we will test the hypothesis that CRH neuron number tunes HPI-axis activity.
While the significance of cell death is widely recognized, the functional impact of CRH neuron cell death has
not been explored. We will use genetic tools to increase or decrease CRH neuron number and determine the
causal relationship between cell number and HPI-axis activity. Together, these aims will shed light on how
intercellular interactions influence CRH neuron cell death and provide a molecular framework for future
molecular studies."
10765656,"Macrophages can have profound effects on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) via the secretion
of pro-inflammatory “M1” cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1). In the
previous cycle, we established that the transcription factor Krüppel like factor 4 in macrophages limits kidney
damage and fibrosis by suppressing macrophage TNF expression. However, TNF and IL-1 are also produced
by renal tubular cells (RTCs), and our preliminary studies have identified 2 factors in RTCs, A20 and Porcupine
(PORCN), that together constrain local TNF and IL-1 generation and ameliorate CKD. A20 is a ubiquitin editing
protein that downregulates NF-b signaling in myeloid cells and thereby protects against autoimmunity. In our
preliminary studies using murine models of inflammation- and toxin-induced renal injury, deletion of A20
selectively from RTCs (A20 KKO) permits enhanced local TNF and IL-1 expression and exacerbations in RTC
damage. We therefore hypothesize that A20 in the nephron protects against tubular damage and subsequent
CKD by constraining local generation of TNF and IL-1. To test this, we will subject A20 KKO and littermate
controls to models of chronic renal tubular injury. We recently reported that TNF in RTCs induces several Wnt
ligand isoforms and that the secretion of Wnt ligands permitted by the O-acyl transferase Porcupine exaggerates
obstruction-induced renal fibrosis. By contrast, in other models featuring proximal tubular injury Wnt signaling
can protect against CKD progression, and in our preliminary studies, inducible nephron-specific deletion of
PORCN upregulates renal TNF expression and exacerbates nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTS). As restoring -
catenin signals can protect the proximal tubule, a key site of TNF-induced injury, we posit that PORCN in
proximal tubular cells suppresses TNF expression and thereby limits the severity of CKD. To test this hypothesis,
we will subject mice lacking PORCN in the proximal tubule (PORCN PTKO) to our tubular injury models. Our
preliminary studies indicate that deleting TNF from the proximal tubule (TNF PTKO) mitigates toxin-induced
tubular damage and prevents cell cycle arrest. Thus, to directly interrogate whether PORCN-dependent secretion
in the proximal tubule limits CKD severity by suppressing TNF-induced cytotoxicity, we will compare the
susceptibility to RTC damage of PORCN PTKO mice and mice harboring double PORCN and TNF deletion
restricted to the proximal tubule (Dual PTKO). We predict that interrupting TNF’s actions in the proximal tubule
will abrogate the augmented susceptibility to CKD accruing from PORCN deficiency in the proximal tubule. With
our integrated approach, we will elucidate nephron-specific pathways upstream and downstream of TNF that
can be targeted for the amelioration of CKD."
10767848,"Aggressive forms of cancer are a leading health problem for United States Veterans. While most cancers
are treatable in their earliest forms, gender-related cancers including those of the breast and prostate are
often fatal when diagnosed at advanced and/or metastatic stages. In 2020, these cancers will account for over
75,400 annual deaths in the general population, with morbidity rates significantly higher in the Veteran
population. While most patients initially respond to treatment, they often relapse and develop aggressive and
drug resistant tumors. A promising approach to better detect and treat these types of cancers may be through
development of agents that target drug resistance biomarkers that associate with cancer stem cells (CSCs).
CSCs make up a small proportion of a tumor but drive tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. There are
few validated CSC biomarkers, and most are not cancer-specific. Our laboratory is at the forefront of new
biomarker and CSC identification using bacteriophage (phage) display. Peptides and antibody (Ab) fragments
that bind the breast and prostate associated Thomsen-Friedenreich carbohydrate antigen, (TF), the lectin
galectin-3 (gal-3) that binds TF and inhibits immune response, and CD444v6 have been obtained. These
antigens are involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, immune regulation, and cell signaling, and are thought to
represent CSC biomarkers. Further, we demonstrated that CD44v6 binds gal-3 through TF interaction,
suggesting this triad may represent a novel target to probe CSCs, tumor growth and immune surveillance.
 Both Abs and peptides have been used with mixed success in cancer imaging and therapy. In terms of
Abs their large size can cause immunogenic problems and long distribution times that once radiolabeled often
leads to organ and tissue damage. Conversely, peptides, particularly those from phage display are
usually hydrophobic and often suffer from poor affinity and tumor uptake. Two different tacks will be
employed that overcome these drawbacks. A pretargeted “click” chemistry approach which decouples the
tumor-targeting step from the radioimaging or radiotherapy step can be employed. This pretargeted approach
is based on the rapid and highly specific cycloaddition reaction that occurs between the trans-cyclooctene
(TCO) on the tumor by allowing the unlabeled targeting Ab to circulate and bind the target. Subsequently,
injection of a small molecule radiolabeled probe with rapid pharmacokinetics and high affinity for the
pretargeted Ab, will result in higher tumor to normal tissue uptake ratios compared to direct labeled Abs. The
second tack will be to conjugate small peptides to a nanoparticle for multi-peptide display. Cornell prime dots
(C' dots) are a new and well-characterized nanoparticle platform that offer both multimodal-targeted imaging
and therapy, and multiplexing biomarker interrogation. C' dots are silica core-shell PEG nanoparticles that
exhibit favorable clearance from the blood and are primarily excreted through the kidney overcoming extended
circulation times. The tunable surface chemistries and favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics allow C' dots to
overcome many of the dose limiting toxicities associated with current monomolecular cancer therapeutics.
 It is hypothesized that the Ab fragments and peptides that target gal-3/TF/CD44v6, coupled with
pretargeting and C'dot multivalent display, will produce theranostic agents for aggressive prostate (PCa) and
breast cancer (BCa). The objectives of this research are to develop: 1) radioimaging and radiotherapeutic
agents of aggressive PCa and BCa tumors, 2) probes that inhibit tumorigenesis leading to reduced
tumor growth and metastasis, and 3) bifunctional molecular therapeutics that increase tumor immune
response through dual targeting with gal-3 and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 Our work will positively impact VA healthcare in that we are developing new targeting agents for detection
and treatment of cancer that will be well tolerated in vivo. This work will help improve the lives of our Veterans
and coincides with BLR&D general goals and special interests of Women's Health and Genomic Medicine."
10917052,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM)
The Career Enhancement Program (CEP) of the Molecularly Targeted Radiosensitization of Locally
Advanced Cancers SPORE at the University of Michigan seeks to identify and foster a trained and engaged
pool of investigators focused on studies of molecularly targeted radiosensitization. Translating basic
discoveries into clinical practice remains a major challenge to the implementation of many promising
funding mechanisms. Accordingly, our program strives to identify and mentor a diverse group of scientists
committed to engaging in this challenge. We firmly believe that progress in translational research is
dependent on supporting and enhancing early career development of investigators committed to make a
difference in cancer patients’ lives. The CEP identifies early career investigators who demonstrate excellent
progress towards achieving independence, as well as established investigators interested in transitioning
their research program to translation of radiation cancer biology to patient care, and senior investigators
with cancer research experience who desire to develop additional expertise in translational science.
Examples of the latter are basic science investigators who plan to test the translation of their studies first in
pre-clinical testing followed by clinical trials. Similarly, clinicians conducting clinical trials who plan to
develop novel approaches grounded in the laboratory but who do not have basic science expertise or a wet
lab in which to conduct necessary preclinical and correlative studies are also considered. A high priority of
the CEP is to identify, support and mentor members of groups traditionally under-represented in academic
health sciences. The SPORE will employ evidence-based practices to encourage proposals from faculty
who are members of groups traditionally under-represented, including women and those from under-
represented racial and ethnic groups, among others. In addition, the SPORE will develop relationships that
will enable identification and encourage proposals from groups traditionally underrepresented in academic
health sciences from nearby institutions that serve minority populations. SPORE leadership and
investigators will encourage best practices to ensure successful mentorship and career development of
participants. Mentoring teams will include experienced mentors who will also be provided with formal
training in both mentorship and sponsorship. The program will articulate clear expectations and goals for
career development and mentoring relationships. It will support participants’ professional development in
areas like clinical trial design and grant writing; it will also offer real-world opportunities for honing
presentation and networking skills in the SPORE annual retreats. The CEP curriculum will target skills in
areas like negotiation, work-life integration, and leadership development, encouraging peer mentorship in
addition to the other forms of mentorship established in the program. Impact will be carefully measured
and evaluated."
10832022,"The use of nanomaterials, especially Engineered Nanomaterials (ENMs), in consumer
products and medicine has been skyrocketing over the past decade. Various in vitro and in vivo
studies evaluating the potential environmental and health effects of ENMs have generated vast
quantities of experimental data, requiring urgent curation for information extraction,
analysis/modeling, and data/model sharing using artificial intelligence methods. Computational
modeling methods, especially machine learning and deep learning approaches, bear high
expectations to develop predictive models for ENMs based on the available
property/activity/toxicity data. Currently ENMs databases do not consist of nanostructure
annotations to store diverse structural information in machine readable formats that are critical
for computational modeling studies. To address this challenge in the current big data era, we will
develop a large, publicly available ENMs portal that contains annotated nanostructures of more
than 3,000 ENMs suitable for the computational modeling research, which will lead to the rational
nanomedicine design. The ongoing Nanotechnology Health Implication Research (NHIR)
consortium is providing high quality ENMs data for the initial ENMs database of this portal and
will also support future data curations. This database will be designed based on Virtual
Nanostructure Simulation (VINAS) technique, which will annotate the complex nanostructures
into machine readable formats that are suitable for the machine learning modeling purpose. To
this end, we will develop various new computational approaches to annotate the nanostructures,
especially for complex ENMs (e.g. graphene derivatives). After that, we will use new machine
learning and deep learning algorithms, such as additive model and explainable AI guided semi-
supervised deep learning technique, to develop predictive models using the ENMs data of the
curated database as the proof of concept. For example, a virtual nanomaterial projection
approach that is based on deep learning, particularly the explainable AI guided semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks, will be especially adept at handling the annotated
nanostructures. In the VINAS database web portal as the final deliverables, the curated ENMs-
bioactivity/property/toxicity data and annotated nanostructures will be shared as downloadable
files for public community to use. And the resulting new deep learning predictive models will be
shared as well. This study provides a new public platform to future data-driven nanoinformatics
modeling studies, especially those machine learning based approaches, and can greatly
advance the rational nanomedicine design and other areas of modern nanoinformatics."
10795013,"ABSTRACT
Defecatory disorders affect 25% of the population and they are poorly recognized and treated. The incidence of
defecatory disorders including chronic constipation is rising and it poses a major healthcare burden. The
underlying mechanisms for these disorders are often not well understood. Obstructed defecation (dyssynergia)
has several causes and is subdivided in four subtypes. Despite the high prevalence and incidence, diagnostics and
treatment options are sparse. A significant problem in anorectal physiology testing is a lack of physiologically
relevant and practical diagnostic test for identifying the underlying mechanisms to identify proper treatment.
Current diagnostic tests provide incomplete and often conflicting information because they do not simulate feces
or the defecation process. Not surprisingly, results of these tests correlate poorly with symptoms and treatment
outcomes. Biofeedback therapy is a well-established therapy for obstructed defecation but despite the substantial
potential and promising results, biofeedback therapy is only done at specialized centers and should be advanced closer
to the point of care. The objective of this small R01 proposal is to monitor and predict the outcome of biofeedback
therapy based on unprecedented integrated visual feedback from the novel simulated feces device termed Fecobionics.
The device is electronic simulated feces that has the consistency and shape of normal stool. Fecobionics will
provide mechanistic understanding of defecation for the examiner by visualizing the geometric (cross-sectional
area, bending and shape of device) and manometric profiles of the simulated feces before and during defecation.
The central hypothesis is that the Fecobionics device that mimics natural dynamic defecation provides valid
data on rectal emptying attempts for the various components of the defecatory system such as the tone of anal
sphincters and puborectalis muscle, and on mechanosensory properties. The objective is to monitor and predict
biofeedback therapy based on mechanism-based and highly integrated data that can be visualized during
anorectal neuromuscular exercises. For the proposed studies, we will select dyssynergia patients, who will be
monitored with Fecobionics before, during and after biofeedback therapy. The hypothesis is Fecobionics data
will correlate better to symptoms based on constipation scores than conventional technologies and that such
data can be used to predict responders and non-responders to therapy. Our proposal seeks to shift current
research in constipation therapy by use of a novel device that provides mechanistic insights by simulating
defecation pathophysiologically and examining the mechanistic changes multi-dimensionally: Pressure,
deformability, biomechanics, and topographic changes to monitor underlying defects in patients with obstructed
defecation, especially in dyssynergia. The unique aspects of our proposal are to simulate stool with a bionics
device that integrates multiple variables that examine the mechanistic underpinnings of obstructed defecation. The
impact of this project is to shed new understanding of constipation and to predict responders. This will facilitate
development of innovative bowel management programs using Fecobionics as the biofeedback therapy tool."
10927207,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Patients with head and neck, lung, esophageal, rectal, and anal cancers typically undergo rigorous, intense,
combined-modality treatment (radiation, surgery, and/or chemotherapy) and experience high symptom burden,
functional impairment, and complex psychosocial issues. Positive treatment outcomes and avoidance of
complications are dependent largely on the adequacy of care provided by family members. However, family
caregivers (CGs) report feeling unprepared to assume the multiple, complex tasks of caregiving, including
tangible help with tracheostomy care, tube feedings, wound and colostomy care, pain management, and
ongoing emotional support. Despite being a critical extension of the oncology healthcare team, training of CGs
to manage symptoms, deal with communication issues with care recipients, and take care of their own physical
and emotional health, is not integrated into clinical practice. This study will measure the effect of a
psychoeducational and skills training intervention that incorporates structured simulation or experiential
learning to improve CG, patient, and healthcare utilization outcomes. Simulation is effective in training
healthcare professionals, but little is known about its effectiveness in training family CGs. The intervention is
designed for the period of active cancer treatment and the immediate transition to posttreatment survivorship, a
time when the CG and patient are most vulnerable. The specific aims of this 2-group, prospective, randomized
controlled trial are to: (1) evaluate the effect of a CG intervention, as compared to a control group, on CG
primary (anxiety) and secondary (depression, health-related quality of life [HRQOL], and fatigue) outcomes; (2)
measure the effect of the intervention on patient outcomes (HRQOL and interrupted treatment course) and
healthcare utilization outcomes (unplanned hospital admission, unplanned emergency room visits, and
unplanned use of intravenous fluids); (3) determine if CG self-efficacy mediates the effect of the intervention on
CG anxiety; (4) determine if patient illness factors, care demands, and patient and CG demographic factors
moderate the relationship between the intervention and CG outcomes; and (5) compare the costs of healthcare
utilization between the intervention and control groups. We will recruit 180 CGs from University Hospitals
Seidman Cancer Center at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. The intervention involves three in-person,
one-on-one sessions during radiation treatments, followed by a telephone contact 2 weeks posttreatment. Data
will be collected at baseline, at the end of radiation treatment, and 4 and 20 weeks postradiation treatment.
The analysis will consist of linear mixed model repeated measures, mediation and moderation tests, and
Poisson regression methods. The proposed project addresses National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer
Control and Population Sciences mission of improving the delivery of care to individuals and family members
affected by cancer. The study findings will provide crucial information for translating the psychoeducational and
simulation methods used in this intervention to other CG populations and clinical settings."
10795644,"While evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for PTSD are effective at reducing trauma-related anxiety
symptoms, about half to two thirds of trauma-exposed Veterans do not fully recover during treatment and
maintain their PTSD diagnosis. Anhedonia, i.e., a reduced interest and engagement in rewarding activities, is
prevalent in trauma-exposed Veterans and is associated with including higher PTSD severity and poorer
response to psychiatric treatment. Impaired reward sensitivity is therefore likely to play a critical role in
treatment responsiveness in Veterans. However, to date, the degree to which such altered reward sensitivity
impacts PTSD treatment responsiveness has not been tested. To test this hypothesis, the proposed study will
combine computational modeling and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assay
reward processing function in Veterans at the end of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and test the
usefulness of such markers in predicting treatment responsiveness. Computational modeling, particularly in
concert with neuroimaging, provides detailed mechanistic insights into complex cognitive processes, which can
predict clinical outcomes more accurately than standard behavioral and neuroimaging analysis. We will
capitalize on this approach to delineate robust predictors of treatment response in trauma-exposed Veterans.
 A total of 186 trauma-exposed Veterans will be recruited immediately upon enrolling in CPT. They will
complete a full clinical assessment and two multi-arm bandit (MAB) tasks (in classic and social conditions, to
be compared in exploratory analyses), in which they must choose on each trial from among a set of options
with unknown reward probabilities, with the goal of maximizing total rewards. Concurrent brain activity will be
measured in a subset of 93 Veterans who will complete the task while undergoing fMRI. A Bayesian learning
model will be applied to participants’ decisions to derive individual-level parameters representing a) individuals’
perceived stability of the unknown reward rates in the environment and b) the degree to which their model-
based expectations of reward influence their choices. Neural activation parametrically associated with trial-to-
trial model-based reward expectations and associated prediction errors (i.e., difference between expected and
observed reward) will be extracted. All participants will complete follow-up clinical and behavioral assessments
immediately after treatment and 3 months after treatment. Computational parameters and model-based neural
activations will be tested as predictors of pre- to post-treatment change in PTSD severity, controlling for pre-
treatment PTSD severity and relevant psychiatric comorbidities. This project aims to determine whether
computational markers of reward processing (Aim 1) and associated neural correlates of reward
anticipation (Aim 2) at the onset of EBT can be useful in predicting reduction in PTSD symptoms
among trauma-exposed Veterans. Aim 3 will assess whether such computational markers are
predictive of post-treatment outcomes 3 months after treatment. Treatment-related change in
computational markers of reward processing and their relationship to change in anhedonia and PTSD
severity will also be explored (Aim 4). The outcomes of this study will help to identify unmet treatment needs
in Veterans and develop treatment planning and relapse prevention tools for Veterans at risk for poor recovery
from PTSD. Identifying such predictive mechanisms will also provide critical neural and psychological targets
for developing more effective, personalized treatments to improve PTSD recovery (e.g., cognitive training to
boost reward sensitivity and decrease anhedonia)."
10812486,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The timely and precise progression of a genetic program along a cascade of regulatory steps is critical to
execute a developmental process. However, gene expression is a highly stochastic process due to inevitable
fluctuations in the kinetics of complex biochemical reactions; this randomness leads to substantial cell-to-cell
variability (gene expression noise). The resulting phenotypic fluctuations can only be detected and quantified at
the single cell level within isogenic populations. One of the most intriguing questions in science is how
developmental pattern formation is executed so precisely and reproducibly despite these unavoidable
fluctuations in gene expression. Presumably, mechanisms that buffer stochastic gene expression must exist.
 Vertebrate somitogenesis provides a paradigm system for studying this question. Somite segments (the
embryonic precursors of vertebrae) are produced sequentially and periodically from the presomitic mesoderm
(PSM) at the tail end of the embryo. The period of somite segmentation is controlled by the segmentation
clock. The segmentation clock exhibits oscillatory expression of Hes/her-family “clock” genes due to an
autoinhibitory intracellular negative feedback loop. Oscillating Delta ligands activate Notch receptors in
neighboring cells and establish an intercellular positive feedback loop that synchronizes oscillation phases
among neighboring cells. Disruption of these synchronized oscillations results in birth defects. The time-course
of somite segmentation and epithelization occur along the posteroanterior direction in the PSM. The
coordinated expression of multiple genes along the PSM are controlled by three interconnected signaling
gradients (Fgf, Wnt and retinoic acid). Somitogenesis is both precise – embryos of a given species develop
certain number of segments with species-specific rhythmicity – and versatile –total number of segments and
their periodicity vary widely among species. Somitogenesis is also robust as embryos form segments with a
certain size distribution, scaling the sizes of segments with body size, even when total cell numbers, cell sizes
or growth rates are altered experimentally. These characteristics indicate that the expression noise within the
oscillating segmentation network is efficiently buffered.
 Our overarching goal is to decipher how expression noise in gene regulatory networks is buffered during
developmental pattern formation. We aspire to reach a mechanistic understanding of this buffering by
combining mathematical/computational/statistical modeling with different genetic and chemical perturbations to
modify dosage of multiple genes or modulate signal feedback strength."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now used as first line therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), yet, only one out of six patients respond. How the
composition and spatial organization of the tumor immune microenvironment relates to ICI efficacy in HNSCC
is currently poorly understood. What is known, is that cancers are dynamic, evolving temporally and spatially in
response to therapeutic pressures, with building support suggesting that on treatment assessment is more
predictive of ICI response than assessment of pre-treatment tissue. In this proposal we will apply innovative
single cell sequencing and imaging approaches to answer a critical question impeding progress in head and
neck cancer care: how the spatial and temporal evolution of tumor and immune cells impacts ICI resistance.
Aim 1 will distinguish tumor cell programs that associate with ICI resistance in primary tissue and serially
measure alterations in these genes in circulating tumor cells. Aim 2 will define how T and B cell subpopulations
and spatial architecture change with ICI initiation and how alterations relate to ICI resistance. Completion of
these mentored aims will set the stage for the long term goal of developing improved predictive biomarkers of
ICI response and identifying new targets for combinatorial therapies. This career development proposal
presents a five-year plan to both accomplish the outlined scientific aims as well as a detailed training program
to ensure the candidate’s transition to research independence. The candidate is an Instructor in
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear and
Massachusetts General Hospital. The training aims, which include hand on experience, coursework and
seminars focused on immunogenomics, build on the candidate’s previous research experience in cancer
genomics and clinical experience as a head and neck cancer surgeon. Mentorship will be provided by thought
leaders in single cell imaging and sequencing, bioinformatics, biomarker science, and cancer immunology
including the primary mentorship team of Dr. Shannon Stott, PhD, Keith Flaherty, MD and Nir Hacohen, PhD
at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center."
10892029,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 OC is the deadliest gynecological cancer in the US. It consists of several histotypes, each biologically distinct
with different clinical challenges. In the first three and half years of the parent grant, in spite of challenges
imposed by COVID, we were able to make substantial progress towards completion of all Aims. We have
published or submitted four papers, with three more to be submitted soon. We were able to develop novel
technologies, new bioinformatics tools, generate and analyze epigenomic and transcriptomic data as planned.
In particular, we discovered that clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) and endometrioid ovarian cancer (ENOC),
two closely related OC histotypes, resemble normal endometrial cells at different menstrual cycle phases
(proliferative/follicular, secretory/luteal). Traditionally, the cell-of-origin and accumulated genetic mutations are
viewed as the most important determinants in initiation and development of cancer. However, this dogma does
not apply to the case of CCOC and ENOC, in that both ovarian cancer subtypes arise from the same cell-of-
origin (ectopic endometrium/endometrial-like cells) and share common genetic mutations (ARID1A, PIK3CA,
KRAS), yet demonstrate drastic differences in cellular phenotype and clinical behavior. Through the case of
ENOC and CCOC, we were able to show how cell state (as opposed to cell type) is an underappreciated notion
in the discussion of cell of origin, and how non-genetic mechanisms (epigenetic and transcriptional) regulate this
process. We also observed substantial molecular heterogeneity in the microdissected tumor compartment,
particularly high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), suggesting the presence of significant intratumoral
cellular heterogeneity in primary human tumors, an issue the parent grant cannot sufficiently address. Therefore,
we propose to examine single-cell variations of non-epigenetic regulators of cellular states in primary human OC
samples, with novel technologies developed during the parent grant."

Valvular heart disease (VHD) is the third-most common cause of heart problems in the United States, with
mitral valve disease as the second-most common VHD after aortic stenosis. Mitral valve disease can cause
many complications if left untreated and is more common in younger patients, in whom bioprosthetic heart
valves (BHVs) are prone to faster degeneration. An ultimate solution for younger patients with long life
expectancy is a living tissue valve, although exploratory studies for tissue-engineered heart valve (TEHVs)
have yet to satisfy the regulatory requirements for clinical use. In preclinical studies, current TEHVs have been
unable to adjust their composition to withstand the hemodynamic loads to which they would be exposed, and
their leaflets were found to shrink due to their degradable scaffolds, which led to poor leaflet coaptation,
followed by progressive regurgitation and valvular insufficiency.
The native mitral valve is bileaflet, with a saddle-shaped annulus that bounces dynamically during the cardiac
cycle. It forms a diastolic transmitral vortex, which efficiently transfers momentum from the left atrium (LA)
toward the aorta via the left ventricle (LV). The transmitral vortex ring is normally non-axisymmetric and helps
maximize blood momentum transfer. Inspired by nature's optimizing of the swirling flow in the LV, we aim to
gain new insights associated with LV vortex effects on heart valve tissue regeneration toward the development
of improved TEHVs, and test those in preclinical studies to be conducted in an ovine model. More specifically,
this project seeks to characterize transmitral vortex flow as a link to discovering novel approaches for heart
valve tissue engineering to enhance tissue generation and cell viability of the engineered leaflets. We will test
the overarching hypothesis that the reciprocal effects between non-axisymmetric vortex flow and mitral TEHVs'
scaffold geometry and annulus dynamics enhance tissue generation and improve the valve's cell viability."

Our group previously identified a C-terminally processing protease (SaCtpA, ctpASA), as being required for full
virulence in Staphylococcus aureus. We demonstrated that SaCtpA is membrane associated and constitutive
produced under standard growth, but is elevated upon exposure to conditions encountered during infection
(serum, immune cells). When we exposed ctpASA mutants to components of the immune system (human serum,
blood and macrophages), we observed increased sensitivity in comparison to the WT. Moreover, using a murine
model of sepsis and dissemination, we observed that ctpASA mutant infected mice survived significantly better
than those inoculated with the WT, and had multiple log decreases in dissemination to the spleen, heart, brain
and kidneys. Recently, a study implicated SaCtpA as inactivating an SOS-induced inhibitor of cell division, in a
manner akin to that seen for CtpA in B. subtilis, which cleaves the SOS induced cell division inhibitor, YneA (no
homology to SosA). Despite these published works, myriad questions remain regarding how SaCtpA
functions in the S. aureus cell, or mediates its key role in virulence. Firstly, SaCtpA is constitutively expressed
at high levels (and thus is not part of the SOS response), therefore having a single substrate is very unlikely.
Indeed, counterparts from CTP1 and CTP-3 families have a wide array of substrates, from myriad cellular
processes. Secondly, the S. aureus enzyme has unique structural features compared to other CTP-enzymes,
including a large N-terminal extension in the cytoplasm, an atypical PDZ domain, and a conserved PG binding
domain - the relevance of which has yet to be determined. Finally, despite a clear link between SaCtpA and
SosA to reboot cell division following DNA damage, the mechanism behind SosA inactivation is completely
unexplored. Therefore, we suggest that this array of novel features, alongside myriad unanswered questions
regarding how SaCtpA functions in the S. aureus cell, or mediates its role in virulence, make this an important
topic for study. Accordingly, we will: 1. Dissect the Influence of SaCtpA: We will begin by performing a structure
function study of the SaCtpA enzyme, to explore its many unique features compared to other CTP enzymes. We
will then globally capture SaCtpA proteolytic cleavage events using cutting edge mass-spectrometric techniques,
developed by ourselves and others. 2. Explore the Impact of CtpA on SosA and Cell Division: There are
many questions that remain regarding engagement of SaCtpA with SosA: How do these two proteins interact?
Where on SosA does SaCtpA bind? What is the motif(s) recognized by SaCtpA? How does SaCtpA cleave SosA
(once, twice, compete degradation)? Are other proteases involved? Thus, it is the focus of this aim to explore
these questions, and shine light on the mechanism of SaCtpA-SosA interaction. Similarly, although LexA-
controlled cell division inhibitors are widespread in Gram-positive organisms, how they mediate their function is
still unknown. Therefore, we will also identify the divisome protein(s) targeted by SosA to inhibit cell division."

This project will map the co-development of multiple clinical and neurocognitive functional domains of ADHD
from childhood to late adolescence. It proposes a novel mix of geospatial coded and other exposure risks
along with multiple polygenic scores to identify etiological mechanisms of course and outcome related to
ADHD. The functional and trait domains to be examined include inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity (the two
ADHD domains), irritability, executive functioning, vigilance, and reward delay discounting (an aspect of
impulsivity). They will be examined over an age span of 7-19 in the first data set (called the Oregon-ADHD-
1000, of some 1450 youth) and ages 9-17 in the second data set (the longitudinal national Adolescent Brain,
Cognition, and Development or ABCD study of some 11,800 children). The behavioral trajectories will be
related to both baseline PRS and exposure metrics (including those available via geo-spatial address coding),
as well as to time-varying changes and cumulative exposure metrics. Exposures or environmental influences
are conceptualized both at a neighborhood level (neighborhood disadvantage, pollution exposure risk) as well
as a within-family level (socio-economic indicators, parent or parenting characteristics). The developmental
trajectories and their genetic and environmental influences will also be related to critical outcomes of mood and
conduct disorder, suicidality, drug and alcohol use, all of which are elevated in relation to ADHD symptoms.
The study is significant in its potential to introduce up-to-date combined exposure-PRS models of ADHD
development that have not been done in a genotype and environment (GxE or G+E) context before using the
methods or follow up density proposed here. It is also significant in its potential to bring clarity to the question
of why ADHD so often leads to deleterious outcomes and to potential preventable moderator influences. It is
innovative in its combining of PRS scores and geospatial coding measures as well as in the density and length
of time development will be able to be examined using these measures. The aims directly target NIMH
Strategic Priorities with a design that will include evaluation of generalizability and add knowledge about
development, etiology, and mechanism. If successful the project will help to isolate actionable causal and
outcome moderators as intervention targets for adolescent risk, including the important priority of suicide risk."

The current process to allocate kidney donor organs to candidates who are waiting for a transplant results in
high numbers of discarded donor organs, an increased cost and burden of care, and high mortality while on the
waiting list. This system is characterized by high rates of offers declined by either clinicians at transplant
centers or patients. Patients receive education about donor offers during their transplant evaluation, and this
evaluation is known to be an overwhelming experience. Patients who are accepted onto the waitlist may then
wait several years before receiving a call about an offer, which may come late at night while patients are
sleeping and requires a decision within 30 minutes. Retention of education from years ago is low, and patients
who are offered a donor with potential risk factors, such as an exposure to infectious disease, may decline the
offer due to risk aversion, anxiety, and fear. Patients are free to decline offers without penalty; however,
evidence consistently shows that accepting an offer provides a survival benefit in nearly all cases. Among
candidates who have received at least one donor offer, over 30% of patients die on the list after offers to them
are declined. Shared decision making (SDM) is a method for helping patients think, talk, and feel through how
to handle the patient’s unique situation. SDM is conducted in conversations between patients, family, and
clinicians with the purpose of developing a medically, practically, and emotionally desirable plan. Optimal SDM
should help patients develop a plan in advance of the actual organ offer, during the period of time patients are
waiting. The study will use an online tool, Donor Plan Donor Call (DPDC), which is completed by patients after
being placed on the waiting list but in advance of an offer. The online tool is preparation for a virtual or in-
person SDM session with their transplant provider. The DPDC tool was informed by behavior change theory
and was developed following a human-centered design process over multiple iterations with user feedback.
This patient-centered tool was developed using a systems approach to complement other interventions to
support offer decisions made by clinicians. The proposed research will provide pilot data using a randomized
trial of usual care compared to the SDM intervention using the DPDC tool with patients and providers at 2
sites. The pilot randomized trial will determine the impact and quality of SDM for patients to plan for an organ
offer (Aim 1). The primary outcome will be willingness to accept donor organs at increased risk of discard.
Secondary analyses will include changes in decisional conflict, knowledge, patient hope and distress, and
duration of time spent making a decision. The study will evaluate the acceptability of SDM with DPDC, barriers
to adoption of the intervention, and other leading indications of implementation success with patients and
providers (Aim 2). This research will allow us to refine the intervention and implementation to facilitate a fully
powered multi-center randomized trial. This proposal fills a critical need to improve donor offer decisions to
reduce patient mortality, the negative health effects from time on dialysis, and discards of viable donor kidneys."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic condition that affects every organ system and requires lifelong
complicated treatment regimens. Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD experience remarkable
increases in negative outcomes (e.g., morbidity, mortality, complications, acute care utilization) following
transition from pediatric to adult care. To mitigate negative outcomes, it is critical that AYA with SCD develop
effective self-management behaviors prior to transition to adult care. However, AYA with SCD face challenges
to self-management behavior development that are compounded by the lack of easily accessible self-
management tools. Our long-term objectives are to develop a comprehensive model of self-management for
AYA with SCD that incorporates mechanisms of self-management behavior development and influencing
modifiable and fixed factors, along with a clinical model of care that addresses mechanisms and influencing
factors and provides AYA and providers with resources to improve self-management behaviors. This R01
application to the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), Self-Management for Youth Living with
Sickle Cell Disease (SMYLS), will advance us towards this objective by supporting: 1) effectiveness testing of
our existing, theoretically founded, mHealth self-management intervention and 2) assessment of the role of
patient activation on self-management behavior development. In Aim 1, we will examine the pre-post
intervention differences in engagement in self-management processes, self-management behaviors, health and
quality of life outcomes, and the relationships among patient activation and outcomes. In Aim 2, we will
determine barriers and facilitators to adoption of the self-management intervention to inform future
implementation initiatives. In the Exploratory Aim, we will identify socioenvironmental and psychosocial
modifiable and fixed variables that influence outcomes. Findings from this study will determine the
effectiveness of a theoretically founded, mHealth self-management intervention for AYA with SCD, identify the
role of patient activation in self-management for AYA with SCD, and characterize influences on self-
management behaviors. In addition, if the intervention is proven effective, findings on barriers and facilitators
to intervention adoption in this study can be applied to the next step in this research trajectory, wide-scale
implementation of the intervention. Our objectives are consistent with the 2022 – 2026 National
Institute of Nursing Research Draft Strategic Plan to reduce disease severity, symptoms, and
progression with a focus on reducing health disparities by targeting improved self-management behaviors pre-
transition to adult care to mitigate subsequent negative outcomes in AYA with SCD, a population that has been
underserved in research and healthcare advancements."

Disruption of lipid metabolism has been associated with metabolic syndrome including obesity,
diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is characterized by the accumulation of
lipids in hepatocytes that can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which has increased
hepatocyte death, inflammation and fibrosis. The molecular basis of the development and progression of
NAFLD/NASH are still poorly understood. As a result, no effective therapeutic treatments for this burgeoning
health problem are available. Thus, there is a clear unmet research need in this area. Hepatic very-low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion is essential in regulating intrahepatic and intravascular lipid homeostasis. Impaired
VLDL secretion leads to hepatic steatosis and hypolipidemia. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is an ER
membrane protein that regulates autophagy by promoting the closure of autophagosomes. Recent evidence
demonstrates that VMP1 plays a critical role in lipoprotein secretion independent of its autophagy function in
cultured hepatoma cells and zebrafish. VMP1 is also an ER scramblase to regulate cholesterol homeostasis.
The major OBJECTIVES of this application are to understand the role and mechanisms by which VMP1
regulates lipid metabolism and NAFLD progression. Our proposal is SIGNIFICANT because it is to investigate
a novel pathway in regulating lipid metabolism and development of NAFLD. Work performed under this
application will enrich the NAFLD field regarding the critical role of VMP1 as a central regulator of ER-
mitochondria crosstalk, which regulate VLDL secretion at multilayers in the development of NAFLD. Our
SICENTIFIC PREMISE is that loss of VMP1 impairs VLDL secretion and promotes NAFLD/NASH. Our
proposal is supported by KEY PRELIMINARY DATA including: 1) Hepatocyte-specific deletion of VMP1 in
mice impaired VLDL secretion resulting in hepatic steatosis and NASH; and 2) VMP1 is critical to concert ER-
mitochondria crosstalk to regulate VLDL secretion in NAFLD. Three SPECIFIC AIMS are proposed: 1)
Determine the mechanisms by which loss of VMP1 decreases hepatic phosphatidylcholine and
phosphatidylethanolamine content resulting in impaired VLDL secretion and NASH; 2) Decipher the role and
the domains of VMP1 in regulating VLDL secretion, phospholipid synthesis and autophagy; and 3) Determine
the mechanisms by which VMP1 ameliorates diet-induced impaired VLDL secretion and NASH. The LONG-
TERM GOAL of this work is to identify VMP1-dependent pathways in regulating lipid metabolism and the
pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH, which may lead to develop potential strategies for treating NASH and other
metabolic diseases by targeting VMP1."

Despite major successes in lung cancer therapy over the last two decades, there are still many patients who do
not receive any benefit from targeted or immunotherapies. This is particularly true for small cell lung cancer
(SCLC), a recalcitrant cancer for which there are currently no effective targeted therapies. Although SCLC
patients initially respond well to conventional chemo- and immune therapy, drug resistance develops rapidly
illustrating the need for new therapeutic targets and drugs. Traditional drug discovery often prioritize known
targets and operates in limited biological and chemical space. Smaller fragment-like compounds are significantly
better suited to enter previously unrecognized binding sites thereby probing uncharted biological target space and
identifying novel targets. We hypothesize that cell-based screening of fragment-like probe molecules combined
with chemoproteomics for target identification will enable the simultaneous identification of (i) novel, highly SCLC-
specific targets and (ii) new lead compounds as modulators of these targets. We propose to specifically interrogate
SCLC cells in comparison to NSCLC and non-cancerous cells and screen a library of small fragment-like
molecules. Combination with innovative proteomics technology can subsequently identify new actionable
targets, which will be functionally validated and will serve as starting points for novel SCLC-specific drug
discovery projects. Aim 1: To identify actionable targets and associated chemical hit compounds in SCLC vs
NSCLC cancer cells. We will screen a 15,000 fragment-like compound library (~estimated to the equivalent of
>100,000 lead-like compounds) in several SCLC, which represent different molecular subtypes, and control
(NSCLC and non-cancerous lung epithelial) cell lines. The most SCLC-specific or SCLC subtype-specific hits
will be validated regarding selective viability and apoptosis effects, also in combination with standard of care
chemotherapy drugs. Aim 2: To identify and validate novel and selective, actionable targets in SCLC cells. Using
a diverse panel of fragment-like compounds with ‘privileged’ BioCore motifs and SCLC-selective screening hits
from Aim 1 we will perform mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomics through UV-mediated photocrosslinking
and copper-catalyzed ‘click’ chemistry in SCLC cell lines. High confidence protein target candidates, based on
comparison with control compounds/cell lines and DEPMAP database mining, will be validated using appropriate
biochemical and signaling readouts, as well as RNAi- and CRISPR-based genetic modulation in an expanded
cell line panel. Medicinal chemistry optimization of hits will be done by 1) chemoinformatic and structure-network
similarity analysis and 2) synthesis of analogs based on the SAR of both library and synthesized compounds.
Leads will be characterized using biochemical and cell-based binding assays (e.g. affinity-immunoblotting, SPR,
nanoBRET). The expected outcome is the identification of novel SCLC- and/or SCLC subtype-specific targets
and chemical starting points for dedicated drug discovery efforts that through further elucidation of the biological
context and in vivo validation produce desperately needed new therapeutics for SCLC."

Background: Histoplasma is a pathogenic fungus that causes life-threatening lung infections. About 500,000
people are exposed to Histoplasma each year in the United States, and over 60% of the US population has
been exposed to the fungus at some point in their life. We have shown that Histoplasma is composed of at
least five different species that vary considerably in the type and magnitude of disease they cause.
Broad, long-term objective: The proposed research will help us identify the genes that allow virulence to
emerge and spread, as well as develop a panel of isolates that once deep-sequenced can be used by the
community of medical mycologists to map any trait of interest in Histoplasma. The objective of this proposal is
to discover whether the genes responsible for differences in virulence among isolates are similar across
species.
Specific aims: Aim 1 of the study proposes to generate genetic reference panels for three species of the
human pathogen Histoplasma. We will use this resource to identify alleles involved with virulence differences
within and between species. Aim 2 will genetically test the phenotypic effects (i.e., virulence in vitro and in vivo)
of the genomic hypotheses produced in Aim1. Aim 3 will study the spread of alleles in clinical samples over a
period of 40 years and will integrate the results from Aims 1 and 2, allowing us to determine whether any of the
alleles involved in virulence have increased in frequency.
Method: This haploid organism is ideal for the laboratory study of fungal pathogens, and it is well-suited for
genomic analysis. We will generate genetic reference panels for three different species of Histoplasma with
state-of-the-art genomic tools and genome-wide association mapping. We will use this panel to identify the
genetic basis of virulence differences within isolates of the same species. Notably, we will generate an online
portal to analyze GWAS data, a first in the medical mycology community. Preliminary results show that given
the amount of phenotypic variance in virulence, our approach and proposed sample sizes make this project
feasible. Validation of candidate virulence genes will be undertaken according to established cell culture and
mouse infection assays. Our approach will generate tools and reference panels for the fungal genetics
community.
Health-relatedness: The disease burden caused by Histoplasma species is substantial in the United States,
with a conservative estimate of at least 3.4 cases per 100,000 population. If infectious strains can transmit the
ability to cause infection to less harmful strains through gene exchange, the potential future disease burden will
grow as global trade, travel and climate change bring new species of the fungus into overlapping geographic
regions. The proposed research will identify what loci are involved in the evolution of virulence and will study
the influence of natural selection in their evolution in recent timescales. This application is in response to a
recent NIH Funding Opportunity Announcement (PA-19-082) supporting research on histoplasmosis and two
other endemic fungal diseases, and this program specifically encourages submission of R01 applications that
will “expand understanding of speciation and impact on clinical outcome.”"

The colon contains tryptophan derivatives such as indole, which is a microbiota-derived signaling molecule, and
the host-derived serotonin neurotransmitter that is primarily synthesized in the GI tract. Indole is also known to
be absorbed by host cells and helps strengthen the integrity of the intestinal barrier, being regarded as a
beneficial chemical cue within microbial/host interactions. Indole is synthesized by tryptophanase, which is
encoded by the tnaA gene. We have shown that the concentration of indole is significantly higher in the lumen
of the colon (the compartment where the microbiota resides) compared to colonic tissues (where indole is
absorbed by intestinal epithelial cells). Serotonin is synthesized in enterochromaffin cells by the enzyme
tryptophan hydroxylase (TpH1). Upon its synthesis, serotonin is released into the lamina propria and is secreted
into the lumen. Serotonin signaling in the intestinal mucosa is terminated by removal of serotonin by the
serotonin selective reuptake transporter (SERT), which is expressed by epithelial cells. We showed that both
serotonin and indole converge to decrease virulence gene expression from enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)
and Citrobacter rodentium, a murine pathogen employed as a surrogate animal model for EHEC. We also
identified the bacterial receptor for these signals as CpxA. Upon sensing serotonin and/or indole, CpxA
functions primarily as a phosphatase, dephosphorylating itself and CpxR, that activates virulence in its
phosphorylated state. Through transcriptome studies we also identified the Indole Sequestering Receptor (Isr),
which in the absence of indole directly activates virulence expression. However, in the presence of indole, Isr is
no longer able to activate transcription of virulence genes. Using TpH1 pharmacological inhibitors (decrease the
levels of serotonin in the gut) and SERT knockout mice (have increased levels of luminal serotonin), we showed
that the presence of higher levels of serotonin in the intestine of mice decreased virulence in C. rodentium,
while decreased levels of serotonin are conducive to increased pathogenesis. Moreover, we synthetically
altered the concentration of indole in the GI tract of mice. This allowed us to assess the role of self-produced
versus microbiota-produced indole, and show that decreased indole concentrations promote bacterial
pathogenesis, while increased levels of indole decreases bacterial virulence gene expression during murine
infection. Altogether, both serotonin and indole decrease virulence of C. rodentium during murine infection. Our
studies show that fluctuations in the levels of indole and the serotonin neurotransmitter significantly impact
disease prognosis. However several questions regarding this exquisite signaling regulation of bacterial
virulence remain unanswered. Consequently the specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1. Define the CpxA/CpxR
and Isr serotonin/indole signaling cascade. Aim 2. Investigate the intersection of serotonin with endogenous
and exogenous indole signaling in bacterial pathogenesis during mammalian infection."

 The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary
immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to
severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately
half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these
diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per
patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped
opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.
 We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs
from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational
genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at
the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis)
(Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk
scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the
EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will
apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases.
We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by
whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand
to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC
medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects
(Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed
Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the
Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls.
For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory
testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.
 The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a
demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic
data to advance care."

The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and
clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the
most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic
causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as
lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to
ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome)
have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to
predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has
never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on
existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of
environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when
linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic
hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident
ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range
of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk
prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific
understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the
development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and
define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level
interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population."

My goal is to become an independent clinical and translational researcher in interstitial lung disease (ILD) which
I outline in this 5-year K23 Career Development Award application. The central goal of my proposal is to establish
omega-3 fatty acid intake (as measured in plasma phospholipids), as a novel risk factor in idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a chronic form of interstitial lung disease in older adults with few available medical therapies
and a poor prognosis with a median survival of 3 to 4 years. This proposal builds upon my preliminary data
showing that higher plasma phospholipid levels of omega-3 fatty acids were associated with less subclinical ILD
on CT and a lower risk of ILD-related hospitalization and mortality among community-dwelling adults. Among
adults with clinically diagnosed ILD, my data shows omega-3 fatty acid plasma phospholipid levels were
correlated with higher forced vital capacity and exercise capacity. My data are consistent with mouse studies
that show administration of omega-3 fatty acids attenuates lung injury and fibrosis which may be driven by
production of omega-3 derived pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs). Under the mentorship of Dr. Imre Noth, I
propose to examine the associations of plasma phospholipid omega-3 fatty acid levels and their metabolites
(SPMs) with disease severity and progression in adults with IPF. I will correlate circulating levels of omega-3
derived SPMs with the lung and identify distinct gene expression profiles and pathways by different SPM levels.
I have crafted a rigorous 5-year career development plan that includes training in respiratory epidemiology (co-
mentor: Dr. Barr) fatty acid biology (co-mentor: Dr. Leitinger), biostatistics (co-mentor: Dr. Ma), and clinical-
translational research and ILD (primary mentor: Dr. Noth) that will position me to become a clinical and
translational independent investigator in patient-oriented research. By achieving the aims of this K23 proposal, I
will establish polyunsaturated fatty acids as a novel modifying factor in IPF leading me to identify specific
phenotypes that will benefit the most from omega-3 therapy and design and implement future clinical trials."

Project Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which
has a profound, currently intractable, neurodegenerative component--a large, unmet clinical need. In many
neurodegenerative diseases, one of the earliest degenerative events is synapse dysfunction and loss. There is
also synapse loss in MS, but the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remains an open question. The overall
hypothesis of this proposal is that complement-dependent signaling underlies synapse loss in
demyelinating disease in a subset of vulnerable neurons. This is largely based on our initial findings in the
developing retinogeniculate circuit demonstrating that classical complement cascade proteins C1q and C3
localize to synapses and that phagocytic microglia engulf and eliminate synapses via the C3 receptor,
complement receptor 3 (CR3). Strikingly, we have new evidence that a subset of retinogeniculate synapses are
also engulfed by microglia, leading to synapse loss, in MS and in multiple MS-relevant animal models of
demyelinating disease (e.g. non-human primate and mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
models). We further identified that this synapse loss can occur early prior to demyelination, axon degeneration,
or cell death, but is coincident with peripheral immune cell infiltration, reactive microgliosis, and increased levels
of complement C1q and C3. However, unlike development, C3, but not C1q, is localized to synapses. Finally,
inhibiting C3 specifically at retinogeniculate synapses in mouse EAE prevents microglial synapse engulfment,
synapse loss, and visual dysfunction. These experiments establish C3 and microglia as key regulators of
synapse loss in MS-relevant demyelinating disease and open up several new questions that we will explore: 1)
What cells produce complement necessary for synapse elimination in demyelinating disease (Aim 1)? 2) Does
microglial complement receptor CR3 regulate synapse loss in demyelinating disease (Aim 2)? 3) Which RGCs
are most vulnerable to complement-mediated synapse elimination and later degeneration (Aim 3)? To address
these questions, we will continue to use the retinogeniculate circuit. This is a highly tractable and powerful
system for studying synaptic changes and it is highly relevant to MS, where inflammation of the optic nerve (i.e.
optic neuritis) occurs in upwards of 50% of patients and results in prolonged, often permanent, visual dysfunction.
We will now use a combination of cell-specific molecular genetics and high-resolution imaging of retinogeniculate
synapses in the mouse EAE model to molecularly dissect synapse loss in inflammatory demyelinating disease.
Results could uncover novel targets aimed at slowing or preventing neurodegeneration in MS, which could be
broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative disease with synapse loss and neuroinflammation (Alzheimer’s
disease, frontotemporal dementia, etc.)."

10748397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The rising tide of antimicrobial resistance threatens catastrophic increases in mortality in the coming
decades. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains a leading pathogen. New antibacterial
classes are urgently needed to ensure adequate therapeutic options for MRSA and other resistant bacteria.
Novel Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitors (NBTIs) derive their efficacy by targeting the clinically validated
essential enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (TopoIV). A novel binding mode avoids target-based
cross-resistance to fluoroquinolones and establishes NBTIs as a new antibacterial class. A lead, gepotidacin,
stands at the threshold of FDA approval, with several completed Phase 2 and ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.
Resistance to gepotidacin has been observed but is very poorly characterized. The transformative potential of
the NBTIs will require a better understanding of mechanisms of action/resistance and new medicinal chemistry
strategies to deliver highly efficacious successor NBTIs, the areas of focus in the present proposal.
 To date, we have synthesized >250 highly diverse NBTIs. Our anti-MRSA lead, 147, showed in vivo
efficacy in two infection models and a favorable cardiovascular safety profile by rationally designed reductions
of basicity and lipophilicity. We have generated NBTIs with improved dual-targeting of gyrase and TopoIV,
reduced rates of spontaneous resistance, and greater antibacterial activity over gepotidacin against NBTI-
resistant MRSA. In contrast to gepotidacin, several newly synthesized amide-containing NBTIs induced DNA
double strand breaks which we will investigate as a new mechanism of action for the NBTI class. Critically, we
also propose that studies with our existing and planned NBTIs, coupled with our demonstrated expertise in
microbiology, biochemical pharmacology, computational chemistry, and structural biology, will effectively
address major unanswered questions regarding the emergence of resistance to NBTIs and strategies to
overcome this issue. Overall, our goal is to generate lead compounds as innovative chemical tools and/or clinical
candidates for further development.
 Three integrated specific aims will be pursued by our interdisciplinary team to:
1) Synthesize structurally and mechanistically distinct NBTIs with druglike properties
2) Evaluate new NBTIs for antibacterial activity & identify/characterize key NBTI-resistant S. aureus mutants
3) Elucidate the mechanism(s) of action of and molecular resistance to new lead NBTIs
 Aim 1 serves as the innovation engine for the proposal. Aims 2 and 3 support Aim 1 through iterative cycles
of rigorous assays to provide new lead compounds. New fundamental information concerning the origin,
mechanism, and impact/circumvention of acquired resistance to NBTIs will advance this new class of
antibacterials as a pathway to promote human health by addressing the crisis in antimicrobial resistance."
10755356,"Abstract
Chronic pain is debilitating disease that affects more Americans than cancer, heart disease, and diabetes
combined. Despite this significant public health problem, effective treatments are scarce and commonly prescribed
opioids possess significant abuse liabilities. One possible reason for this poor translational success is that we still
lack a detailed understanding of how these circuits are connected to process sensory information and their plasticity
mechanisms. In our preliminary experiments we have identified important roles for trans-synaptic adhesion
molecules in regulating somatosensory synapse function in the spinal cord. Here we will determine the trans-
synaptic molecules that influence somatosensory synapse formation, understand how presynaptic adhesion
molecules in somatosensory neurons instruct the formation and function of native synapses in the spinal cord, and
establish their role in coordinating nociceptive circuit assembly to regulate pain behaviors. This proposal will use a
combination of in vitro synapse induction assays, conditional gene knockout and rescue approaches, peripheral
viral circuit tracing, optogenetic slice recordings, and somatosensory phenotyping to understand how trans-
synaptic adhesion molecules regulate somatosensory circuit assembly and function."
10764817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain age can be used a predictor of deviation from typical age trajectories due to disease processes. Because
brain age is strongly associated with neurodegenerative disease, brain age predicted from magnetic resonance
images (MRIs) can become an affordable and noninvasive preclinical indicator of mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. Today’s best brain age estimation approaches use black-box machine
learning (ML) that often lacks interpretability in the sense that it does not specify which neuroanatomic features
are critical for brain age estimation. The first aim of this project is to design, test, and validate an interpretable
ML architecture that leverages brain MRIs to estimate brain with high accuracy. We will construct an interpretable
ML architecture trained on structural MRIs to identify neuroanatomic features that reflect brain age at the level
of subjects and cohorts. These techniques will be tested and validated to ensure trustworthiness and generali-
zability to new datasets. We hypothesize that our ML can use MRIs to predict MRI-derived brain age significantly
more accurately than existing methods. Our second aim is to map neuroanatomic features that predict brain age
and that reflect abnormal aging observed in MCI/AD. We will test the hypothesis that, aside from aging-related
neuroanatomic features shared by cognitively normal subjects and MCI/AD patients, the latter exhibit additional
neuroanatomic features that can distinguish them from the former, early during adulthood, with high sensitivity,
specificity, and precision. Our third aim is to use genome-wide association (GWAS) to find genes associated
with neuroanatomic features of brain aging that predict MRI-derived brain age. We will synergize our interpreta-
ble ML approaches with GWAS to find genetic factors that affect brain aging features predictive of MCI/AD diag-
nosis. We will develop and validate a polygenic risk score (PRS) of resilience/vulnerability to accelerated brain
aging observed in MCI/AD. If successful, this project will deliver trustworthy, generalizable, and interpretable ML
approaches that can leverage MRIs to identify novel brain aging features reflecting MCI/AD risk. Because aging
is a lifelong process, we have the potential to detect such features much earlier than currently possible. Im-
portantly, we will identify genes that act on brain aging in ways that may lead to MCI/AD. This can provide
considerable insight on the potential mechanisms relating genetic factors to brain aging and MCI/AD."
10756165,"Birth defects, which occur in 3 - 5% of US-born infants per year, are a leading cause of childhood mortality and
repeated hospitalization and are a large burden to families and society. Birth defects typically result from rare
genetic changes, but determining which gene-variant causes a phenotype and disease remains challenging,
despite significant advances in next-generation sequencing and analysis. Whereas ~4,000 human genes have
been linked to monogenic, rare diseases, it has been estimated that 6,000-13,000 additional rare disease genes
remain to be identified, many of which are likely causal for birth defects; this underscores a need for effective
strategies to assess the functional effects of associated variants.
 In this application, we propose a multi-organism approach to connect patient presentation with genes not
previously associated with disease (genes of uncertain significance, GUS). Focusing on intellectual and
developmental disorders and structural birth defects, we will first screen patient birth-defect associated GUS
leveraging experimental tractability of C. elegans, Drosophila, or zebrafish, followed by assessment of patient-
related phenotypes in vertebrate organisms (zebrafish, mouse, or established human embryonic stem cell lines
(hESCs)) for a subset of these genes. In Aim 1, bioinformatic analysis of family based clinical exome sequence
will identify high probability candidate gene-variants that may be causal for the patient’s symptom(s) for further
study. In Aim 2, nominated candidate gene-variants will be screened in worm, fly or fish to obtain in vivo functional
data in support of variant causality. Functional information will help determine whether the gene-variant is
damaging, if the gene is required in a specific tissue, and whether the observed genetic mechanism (e.g.,
hypomorph, dominant negative, etc.) is consistent with patient genetics. Additionally, these experiments may
illuminate the molecular or cell biological mechanism disrupted by the gene-variant (e.g., disruption of
cytoskeleton, etc.). We will take advantage of the strengths of the different model organisms—CRISPR editing
for C. elegans, tissue-specific RNAi in Drosophila, and mRNA and CRISPR embryo injections for zebrafish—in
the genetic screening approach. A total of 84 candidate birth defect GUS will be screened in Aim 2 over the grant
period. Often, the phenotypic effects of the corresponding disruption of the orthologous gene in worm or fly are
not obviously related to the phenotype observed in humans. Therefore, in Aim 3, for a subset of genes (23)
identified from the screen as likely disease-causing in Aim 2, we will examine phenotypes in zebrafish, mouse,
or hESC systems, to advance our understanding of disease phenotype and progression that is not possible in
simple model organisms or with the patient. These studies will leverage our experience in disease gene modeling
and our work with clinical collaborators to understand the phenotypic, genetic, molecular, and cell biological
basis of each patient’s disease. This innovative multi-organism experimental platform will significantly accelerate
identification of birth defect-causing genes and will open avenues to diagnosis, prevention, and therapies."

Active perception, the ability to seek out behaviorally relevant information, is guided by both cognitive and motor
behaviors and is influenced by fluctuations in endogenous brain state. It is a result of the concerted activity of
ensembles of neurons in the sensory hierarchy. These ensembles interact flexibly and dynamically as the
organism transitions between various behavioral and brain states. However, the state-dependent information
processing principles that underlie the activity of such ensembles are largely unknown. A rich body of theoretical
and recent experimental work has shown that dependencies, such as co-variability, within an ensemble strongly
influence their information carrying capacity and hence their functional efficacy. Further, theoretical investigation
of these dependencies has revealed that their influence is determined by the extent of their alignment with the
information coding dimension of an ensemble. The source of dependencies – shared vs. local – has been
identified as a key determinant of this alignment. A critical step toward determining this source is to characterize
the joint spiking activity (beyond pairwise correlations) of populations in these ensembles. This is, however, a
challenging task owing to the varied non-linear nature of neuronal interactions, and the fact that neural
populations are sparsely sampled by current recording techniques. Tackling this problem requires a highly
interdisciplinary approach spanning advanced techniques in systems and computational neuroscience. Based
on our preliminary data and prior studies, our broad hypothesis is that the computations of active perception are
cortical layer-specific and that they are mediated by ensembles of neural sub-populations defined by their layer
identity and cell-class. We propose to answer several key questions regarding this hypothesis: how does active
perception modulate information flow in laminar circuits, both during attention (Aim 1A) and saccadic eye
movement (Aim 1B)? How are the laminar circuits of active perception modulated by internal brain state
fluctuations such as those during cued attention (Aim 2A) and spontaneous vision (Aim 2B)? We will achieve
these aims using laminar high-density recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates, while animals are
engaged in either task-based or spontaneous active perception. Using a novel combination of dynamic Bayesian
networks
among
 (DBN) and partial information decomposition (PID) we will infer distinct categories of dependencies
cortical network components. Our proposal will achieve the first systematic characterization of modulation
of information flow (beyond pairwise correlations) by active perception processes in the context of laminar cortical
circuits. Our proposal is the first study to investigate how internal brain state fluctuations shape the ensemble
level causal motifs of active perception. The results of these investigations will significantly advance our
understanding of information flow structure in a canonical cortical circuit and provide a broad framework for
investigating such structures in brain-wide circuits."
10771270,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease affects 6 million Americans, is the 6th leading cause of death in the nation and substantially
impacts patients’ quality of life with no effective cure available. As the population over the age of 65 is projected
to triple by 2035, the number of Alzheimer’s disease patients is expected to increase by at least two-fold.
Therefore, there is an unmet medical need to develop novel treatments to prevent and or cure Alzheimer’s
disease.
Recent studies indicate that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s
disease. Although the newer sEH inhibitors have sub-nanomolar potency, they generally suffer from poor blood-
brain barrier penetration and unsuitable physical properties. As a high percentage of sEH inhibition / engagement
is needed to elicit significant biological activity, sEH inhibitors with high blood-brain barrier penetration and
exposure are needed.
Although the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of sEH inhibitors have been extensively investigated, their
impact on blood-brain barrier penetration has rarely been studied and the existing clinical candidates are
predicted to have poor CNS exposure. While most of the SAR studies focus on the substituents on both ends of
the inhibitors, the linker of the inhibitors has rarely been explored. We will investigate how modifications of sEHI’s
linker and other modifications affect its CNS drug-like properties and CNS exposure. We will then systematically
incorporate the optimized modifications to further improve sEHI’s drug-like properties and CNS exposure. Aim 1
of this project will apply a novel design-test-learn strategy to guide the design of the novel sEHIs using our in-
house assays to screen sEHIs potency, binding kinetics and in vitro pharmacokinetic parameters. The top
candidates will be screened for their PK properties and CNS exposure using our established low dose oral
cassette dosing methodology. We will then further determine the detailed pharmacokinetic properties and CNS
exposure parameters of the selected candidates. As the program progresses, we will our observations for further
optimization. The optimized candidates will be selected based on the new sEHIs’ potency, binding kinetics, CNS
drug-like properties, pharmacokinetic parameters and CNS target engagement for the in vivo efficacy testing. In
Aim 2, the optimized sEHIs will be subjected to a 7-day dose range finding experiment and the sEHI, which can
inhibit at least 90% of brain sEH with the lowest dose, will be selected for testing in mouse and rat Alzheimer’s
disease models to determine their efficacy."

In P01 AI123036, we were able to generate an algorithm that ranked single agents for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB), identified promising 2-drug combinations and, with a completely novel mathematical
approach, identified 3-drug regimens predicted to be significantly better than 2-drug regimens. These predictions
were prospectively validated in a BALB/c model (H37Rv) and in a Non-Human Primate model of MTB (Erdman
strain). In this proposal, we will extend our previous work.
There is a large number of new MTB agents, many with novel mechanisms of action. We have 4 Specific Aims
(SA) that, when complete, will allow us to identify multi-drug combinations that will optimize rate of kill for
organisms in 3 different metabolic states and will suppress resistance emergence.
In the Hollow Fiber Infection Model [HFIM] (SA#1), we will be able to rank new agents on the bases of potency
and physicochemical properties. The HFIM provides insight into the drug’s exposure-response for kill and
resistance suppression. We identified a near optimal 3-drug regimen (PMD/MFX/BDQ). With new single agents,
we can examine substituting a new agent for an older agent AND we can expand the regimens to identify a near-
optimal 4-drug regimen. This will be particularly important for patients with high bacterial burdens.
In SA #2, we will test regimens from SA#1 in two murine models (BALB/c & C3HeB/FeJ mice). These will give
somewhat different information. Both give information regarding kill and resistance suppression. Kramnik mice
have pathology more closely resembling that in humans. We will use Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption
Ionization-MS Imaging and Laser Capture Microdissection LCMS. This allows identification of spatial distribution
and quantification of drugs. A question regarding cure is how long to wait to sacrifice animals to document
eradication. Some agents (BDQ) have long tissue half-lives. We will document rates of ingress/egress of drugs
into the infection site, allowing determination when animal cohorts may be sacrificed to document eradication.
In SA #3, we will document mechanisms of antimicrobial effect quantitatively. We have generated a first-of-a-
kind dynamic model for PBP-binding in MTB, and will link this to rates of cell kill. We have also developed
AMP/ADP/ATP intracellular assays. These will be employed for agents like diarylquinolines (e.g. BDQ) and PMD
that act as energy poisons (for PMD, this occurs under anaerobic/non-replicative conditions. We will measure
intracellular (MTB) drug concentrations, linking them to effect alone and in combination therapy experiments.
Proposal success rests on modeling of the data. In SA #4, we have written code to extend earlier analyses,
going from 3- to 4-drug regimens. For these high dimensional models, we developed several approaches to
speed up analysis making them computationally tractable. At proposal end, we shall develop a 4-drug algorithm
allowing rapid identification of near optimal regimens that work for both susceptible and less-susceptible
organisms. The algorithm will be general. It will work well for today’s agents but also for agents as discovered."

Early life exposure to environments rich in microbial products corresponds with a more diverse microbiota and
significantly decreases susceptibility to developing asthma and atopic sensitization. However, it is unclear how
this early life exposure supports proper immune function. In recently published data, we find thymic expansion
of microbiota specific T cells in early life. This is driven by microbiota carrying intestinal dendritic cells migration
from the intestine to the thymus. We hypothesize specific microbial signals in intestinal environment in young
mice, including signaling downstream of microbe attachment to intestinal epithelial cells, encourages intestinal
DC trafficking to thymus. In the thymus, we hypothesize these microbes serve as a template to ensure expansion
of microbe specific T cells, offering protection from pathogen challenge. Understanding these specific microbial
derived signals, as well as unique thymic environmental cues during early life will allow us to understand this
novel pathway. In Aim 1 of the proposed work, we will use in vivo models to understand the role for the intestine
in this system, identifying molecular signals activating thymic migration of intestinal DCs. In Aim 2 we will
determine the thymic signals that allow for thymic expansion of microbiota specific T cell. We will determine
whether gut migratory APCs regulate selection or expansion of microbiota specific T cells. Finally, will determine
whether migration is restricted by the age of the thymus or intestine environment through a series of thymic
transplant studies. These mechanistic studies will help identify pathways that we will be able to manipulate to
alter thymic T cell development and limit or rescue from the development of inflammatory disease."
10788429,"Fundamental to sexual reproduction is the ability to make gametes, such as sperm and eggs in
humans, which contain only one copy of each chromosome. Fertilization then results in the fusion of two
haploid gametes to create a diploid organism. For organisms such as budding yeast and humans, this is a
daunting task, as there are 16 and 23 pairs of chromosomes, respectively, that must be properly sorted into
each gamete. Meiosis is the specialized cell division that divides the chromosome number in half by having
one round of DNA replication followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation. Failure to properly
segregate chromosomes during meiosis produces chromosomally imbalanced gametes, resulting in infertility
and birth defects such as Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome).
 A critical part of meiosis is the first meiotic division, where homologous chromosomes are segregated
to opposite poles of the spindle. Crossovers are created by the reciprocal exchange of DNA between
homologs. Crossovers, in combination with sister chromatid cohesion, physically connect homologs so they
can align and properly segregate at the first meiotic division. Crossovers result from the repair of double strand
breaks that are deliberately introduced into chromosomes to initiate recombination. Because unrepaired double
strand breaks are lethal, meiotic recombination is a highly regulated process that ensures that every pair of
homologs receives at least one crossover and that all double strand breaks are repaired before the first meiotic
division.
 Studying meiosis directly in mammals is difficult as it is hard to access germ cells and the cells are
diploid, making it challenging to find recessive mutations. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has
been an excellent model system for studying meiosis because of the sophisticated genetic, biochemical,
molecular and cell biological tools that are available. The focus of my research has been on identifying genes
required for meiotic recombination and defining the molecular mechanisms by which these genes function
and/or are regulated. In particular, my lab has developed novel approaches for studying how phosphorylation
regulates recombination during meiosis, with an emphasis on the meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1 and the
conserved cell cycle kinase, Cdc7-Dbf4.
 Although immense progress has been made in our understanding of meiotic recombination, there are
still critical gaps that need to be filled. For example, there are many genes that contribute to the fidelity of
meiotic double strand break repair which remain to be discovered. Over the next five years, my lab plans to
study two genes we have identified that were previously unknown to play a role in meiosis: SEN1 and RRM3.
Sen1 is a helicase that unwinds RNA/DNA hybrids called R-loops in mitotically dividing cells and is essential
for life. Its mammalian ortholog, Senataxin, is required for meiosis. Rrm3 is a member of the conserved Pif1
DNA helicase family that is well known for its role in DNA replication. In addition, we have discovered a
potentially novel role for two other DNA helicases, Sgs1 and Srs2, working together in the regulation of
crossover formation.
 Meiosis in many organisms such as yeast and mammals requires two recombinases, Rad51, which is
essential for mitotic recombination and the meiosis-specific Dmc1, which mediates the bulk of interhomolog
recombination. An outstanding question is why two recombinases are necessary. Work from my lab and others
has suggested that Dmc1 has evolved to better handle the mismatched basepairs that can arise by
interhomolog strand invasion because homologs have highly similar, but not necessarily identical DNA
sequences. My lab has developed an in vivo approach to test this interesting hypothesis. The work supported
by this grant will make an important contribution to our understanding of meiosis, knowledge which may
ultimately be applicable in humans for preventing/treating infertility and birth defects."
10791891,"Ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a prevalent complication of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) especially in young adults. Pathogenic variants of sarcomeric protein genes
cause about half of inherited HCM and about a third of sporadic HCM. Little is known, however, about
how sarcomeric protein variants lead to arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. There is a major unmet
need for a better understanding of disease mechanisms in order to predict patients at risk for SCD and
design mechanism-based therapeutics.
To address this gap, we will apply high throughput functional genomics to identify individual protein
components of arrhythmogenic signaling, and establish their function using in vitro studies in iPSC-
derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and in vivo studies in HCM mutant mice. We will begin by
generating functional genomics probes of the intracellular arrhythmogenic signaling in iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes carrying HCM causative variants in MYBPC3, MYH7 and TNNT2. The probes will be
identified based on screening synthetic miRNAs (syn-miRs) which collectively suppress nearly all
proteins in the cell and therefore make ideal probes of complex biology. Analysis of probe selectivity
for gene variants will indicate the existence of common and/or distinct signaling mechanisms. In parallel,
we will identify and characterize candidate pathways indicated from analysis of myectomy samples
from MYBPC3 mutant HCM patients. Once we have obtained pathway information and probes from
these two approaches, we will comprehensively determine the protein mediators by high throughput
functional evaluation in the MYBPC3 mutant iPSC-CMs. Based on the effect in the iPSC-CMs,
selectivity for MYBPC3 and potential as a drug target, we will prioritize the most promising candidate
targets for in vivo evaluation by AAV9 knockdown in HCM transgenic mice carrying a Mybpc3 mutation
homologous to that in the iPSC-CMs. We expect that modulating the function of the candidate
mediators will suppress arrhythmia and tachycardia in the Mybpc3 mutant mice.
In summary, these studies will increase our understanding of the arrhythmogenic signaling caused by
HCM mutations and promote the development of improved prognostic and mechanism-based
therapeutics for familial HCM patients. It will also increase our understanding of fundamental
cardiomyocyte biology that might underlie other cardiac diseases. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine
if discrete signaling mechanisms cause arrhythmic susceptibility across “high” propensity HCM gene
variants, and 2) Comprehensively define the proteins that dictate electrical remodeling by functional
screening in MYBPC3 mutant iPSC-CMs and test their efficacy as therapeutic targets in an Mybpc3
mutant mouse model of HCM."

Volume overload (congestion) occurs in patients with heart failure (HF) and is the leading cause
of hospitalization in the elderly worldwide. Unfortunately, clinical signs and symptoms;
laboratory values; and existing diagnostic tools are unreliable in providing accurate assessment
of volume status. Using a unique physiologic signal, Non-Invasive Venous waveform Analysis
(NIVA), VoluMetrix has developed a proprietary device and algorithm designed for monitoring
volume status in HF patients. Proof of concept data in humans and experimental animal
models, demonstrate that NIVA provides a reliable indication of intravascular volume status
(“pulmonary capillary wedge equivalent”). The work in this Phase IIB proposal will establish
interface and usability studies to complete the process necessary for bridging the gap to
commercialization."
11055562,"Despite major advances in treatment and prevention of HIV infection, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues
 to cause tremendous morbidity and mortality. Of the 37.7 million people living with HIV worldwide, only
 73% are receiving antiretroviral therapy. In 2020 alone, an estimated 680,000 people died from
 AIDS-related illness, and nearly two million people are newly infected with HIV each year. The HIV burden
 is highest in parts of the world that face the additional challenge of highly constrained resources. HIV
 testing and treatment guidelines have continually evolved; however, assessing the benefits associated
 with improved testing, more effective antiretroviral therapy, and increasingly effective prevention
 interventions is difficult. It is unclear which specific strategies and overall approach would be most
 effective for specific populations, given the critical reality of budget constraints.
 This competing continuation proposes to expand upon the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS
 Complications International (CEPAC-I) Model, a computer microsimulation of the natural history,
 management, outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of HIV clinical care. This proposal includes
 cutting-edge, guideline-informing studies of novel treatments and development of innovative modeling
 optimization methods to advance the field. There are two specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: To expand the CEPAC-I microsimulation to address new clinical policy questions focused
 on key populations, using data from recent clinical trials and implementation research studies.
 Specific Aim 2: To expand upon the optimization model and better determine the combination of HIV care
 interventions that most decreases HIV incidence in countries with different epidemic characteristics and
 resource constraints.
 In close alignment with the 2022 research priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, the goals of this
 proposal include reducing HIV incidence, identifying optimal prevention and treatment responses, and
 reducing health disparities by improving key population outcomes. The assembled research team has the
 ideal combination of skills and experience to address critical questions around the cost-effectiveness of
 new interventions for HIV in high-risk populations. The results will lead to new insights to inform clinicians
 and policymakers, leading to improved HIV treatment guidelines in multiple resource-limited settings.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 People living with HIV/AIDS remain untreated and more become newly infected each year. Many testing,
 treatment, and prevention methods exist, raising critically important questions about which strategies to
 employ when, where, and for whom, given varying epidemic features and resource constraints. We will
 expand the CEPAC-I Model to address questions related to the impact of novel treatment and prevention
 options and to determine which combinations of interventions will optimize HIV health outcomes globally."
10815535,"TYRO3 is a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. All three
family members are aberrantly expressed in cancer cells, where they function to promote cell survival, mediate
resistance to a variety of cytotoxic chemotherapies and molecularly-targeted agents and have additional roles in
macrophages and other innate immune cells where they function to suppress anti-tumor immunity, leading to
enhanced tumor growth and metastasis. These and other data implicate the TAM kinases as potential
therapeutic targets in a wide variety of human tumors. Moreover, because of the oncogenic roles for TAM kinases
in both tumor and immune cells, inhibitors are expected to provide anti-tumor action mediated by both direct
tumor cell killing and modulation of the innate immune response. While the TAM kinases have overlapping
functions, they also play unique roles in some contexts. Specifically, our preliminary data suggest that
suppression of anti-tumor immunity is particularly dependent on TYRO3.
 Here, we propose to utilize a well-established and productive team of researchers along with
computational-aided drug design and enzymatic, cell-based and pharmacodynamic assays to develop novel,
potent, and selective TYRO3 inhibitors and validate their biochemical and functional activities in TYRO3-
dependent tumor xenograft models and immune-competent syngeneic cancer models. TYRO3 can localize to
the nucleus and inhibition of nuclear localization induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells, suggesting non-
canonical oncogenic functions for TYRO3 which might not be effectively targeted by kinase inhibition alone.
Thus, both traditional small molecule kinase inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeric (PROTAC) degraders
that selectively target TYRO3 for ubiquitination and degradation will be developed and compared. At the
completion of this work, we expect to deliver a TYRO3-selective inhibitor suitable for advancement to GLP toxicity
studies in multiple species, sufficient preclinical validation studies to support an IND application describing this
compound, and a viable method for large-scale synthesis of the compound."
10795872,"ABSTRACT
About 50% of DUI offenders report that the last place they drank an alcoholic beverage was at a local bar or
restaurant, and higher rates of alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and violence occur in communities with
higher densities of licensed on-premises establishments such as bars and restaurants. Studies in various
locations across the U.S. also consistently show high rates of alcohol service to pseudo-intoxicated patrons at
bars. To address these continuing public health problems, California enacted the Responsible Beverage
Service Training Act in 2017 to decrease the over-service of alcohol to intoxicated patrons at licensed on-
premises establishments. Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) refers to the steps that servers of alcoholic
beverages can take to reduce the chances that their patrons (or guests) become intoxicated, or failing that, to
intervene so as to reduce the risk of subsequent harm to the patron or others. The primary mechanism to
encourage responsible service has been some form of staff or manager training. Typically, such training
includes the laws that govern serving behavior, the effects of alcohol on the body, recognizing signs of
intoxication, and strategies for refusing service to someone who displays those signs. One might suppose that
RBS training would be an effective prevention strategy, but evaluation results have been mixed. The California
RBS Training Act mandates training for all alcohol servers beginning in 2021 giving us a rare opportunity to
look more closely at how a statewide RBS training initiative might influence server behavior. The proposed
research will include a replication of an evaluation of the mandatory statewide RBS training law implemented in
Oregon, as well as a randomized trial in which an online RBS training program known to be effective will be
used as a “benchmark” against which a comparison group of “usual and customary” practices will be measured
for the efficacy of their training. The specific aims are: (1) To evaluate the impact of mandatory server training
on alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes in California; and (2) To evaluate the efficacy of “usual and
customary” training when compared to an online training known to be effective (WayToServe) on the likelihood
of refusals to pseudo-patrons; (3) To conduct a state-wide survey of owners/managers of alcohol outlets that
will help identify obstacles or facilitators of the new server training law. This study will determine whether the
statewide mandate is sufficient to reduce alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes, whether “usual and
customary” practices and training will match the efficacy of a high-quality online RBS training program in
improving alcohol serving behavior."

 The purpose of the Expanded Pilot and Feasibility Program (ePFP) of the Washington University
Diabetes Research Center (DRC) is to extend our Pilot and Feasibility Program to diabetes investigators at
institutions without NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers. The ePFP focuses on providing modest
support to: (1) new investigators who do not yet have their own peer-reviewed research support; (2)
established investigators from other fields of investigation who want to apply their expertise to diabetes-related
research; and (3) scientists already in diabetes research who are embarking on an entirely new direction. We
propose to continue supporting highly successful subcontracts with three partner institutions: the University of
Kentucky, the University of Utah, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Each of these universities has an
outstanding research base in diabetes. Philip Kern, Scott Summers, and Alan Attie, internationally recognized
diabetes scholars with strong leadership experience, serve as subcontract Program Directors at Kentucky,
Utah, and Wisconsin, respectively. Each subcontract will fund two meritorious pilot grants per year at each
institution. The application and review procedure for the ePFP is fully integrated with the Washington University
Pilot and Feasibility Program. Successful ePFP applicants participate in the annual Washington University
Diabetes Day, which promotes interactions and mentorship. Thus, the ePFP leverages the success of the
Washington University DRC to serve a wider scientific community and to enhance scientific exchange
between four institutions. Moreover, the ePFP has nurtured the growth of diabetes research at our
partner institutions, leading to the development of proposals for new Diabetes Research Centers at the
University of Utah and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Supporting diabetes research beyond the
confines of Washington University is a strength of the Washington University DRC."
10813073,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cells in the body perceive cues from their local environment, which control cellular behavior through a
coordinated series of molecular events known as signaling. Signaling is critically important for telling a cell if it
should grow and divide, migrate to a different part of the body, or commit suicide if it has completed its function
or been irreparably damaged. Frequently, signaling processes are found to be working incorrectly in diseased
cells. For instance, cancer cells divide and migrate out of control and ignore cues which should keep them in
check. Signals come in multiple forms. Specific molecules bind and activate cognate receptor proteins in the cell,
known as “chemical signaling”, which is broadly well-understood. Physical forces and the rigidity of a cell’s
environment also elicit specific cell behaviors, but we have a comparatively poor understanding of how proteins
transmit these “mechanical signals”. A significant fraction of successful drugs target protein molecules which
operate in chemical signaling. The development of many such treatments was stimulated by determining the
detailed three-dimensional chemical structures of the interactions between receptor proteins and the molecules
which activate them, facilitating the design of drugs which precisely intervene in these processes. Despite its
importance, efforts to therapeutically target mechanical signaling have been limited. The long-term goal of this
research project is to visualize how forces modulate the three-dimensional structure of mechanical signaling
proteins to activate them, in order to facilitate the development of drugs that block these changes.
 This proposal is specifically focused on understanding how cellular polymers (“filaments”) composed of
the protein actin coordinate mechanical signaling. The cell contains many networks composed of actin filaments,
myosin molecular motor proteins, and hundreds of other binding partners, which collectively generate and
transmit diverse forces. We hypothesize that specific types of forces cause distinct physical rearrangements in
actin filaments, which can be detected by other proteins in the cell through direct binding interactions. We will
identify proteins which bind actin in a force-sensitive manner (Aim 1), focusing specifically on delineating the
precise regions of the proteins which confer force-sensitivity. We will next visualize how side-wise bending forces
(Aim 2) and length-wise tensile and compressive forces generated by myosin motor proteins (Aim 3) impact actin
filament structure, hypothesizing these force regimes produce distinct rearrangements which can be
discriminated by binding partners. In pursuit of these Aims, we are developing sample preparation and
computational image analysis approaches to visualize the three-dimensional structure of actin polymers in the
presence of mechanical forces with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In addition to providing basic insights
into how forces are perceived by cells through changes in protein structure, our studies will guide the
development of precise molecular interventions into mechanical signaling processes governed by actin."
10755361,"Renal artery stenosis (RAS) remains a common cause of hypertension and end-stage renal disease in the
elderly population, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recent data suggest that renal ischemia
in RAS interferes with endogenous kidney repair mechanisms, such as CD133+/CD24+ scattered tubular-like
cells (STCs), which can proliferate and their progeny re-differentiate into tubular epithelial cells to replace lost
neighboring injured tubular cells. Our previous studies have shown that experimental RAS impairs the
reparative capacity of swine STCs by inducing structural and functional abnormalities in their mitochondria.
However, the processes underpinning RAS-induced STC mitochondrial damage remain unclear.
 Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. MiRNA genes are
transcribed in the nucleus, which results in the production of pri- and pre-miRNA precursors, and subsequently
mature miRNAs. Although most mature miRNAs are present in the cytosol, few miRNAs, known as ‘mitomiRs’,
translocate to the mitochondrion to silence gene expression related to mitochondrial functions.
 Our preliminary data show that RAS increases expression of the mitomiR-181c in swine STCs associated
with decreased expression of its mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded mitochondrial
gene targets, and in turn mitochondrial structural abnormalities and dysfunction. In addition, we found that the
promoters and enhancers of the miR-181c gene (MIR181C) exhibit hyper 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine
(5hmC), an epigenetic mark generated by the oxidation of 5mC by the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine
dioxygenase (TET) enzyme. Excitingly, in our pilot studies anti-miR-181c, the TET inhibitor Bobcat339, and
inhibitors of the mitomiR import proteins ameliorate mitochondrial damage in swine-STCs.
 Our central hypothesis is thus that altered miR-181c expression in STCs underlies RAS-induced STC
mitochondrial damage, blunting the paracrine function and capacity of STCs to preserve the post-
stenotic kidney. Three specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1: will test whether increased miR-181c expression
in RAS-STCs induces mitochondrial structural damage and dysfunction in STCs. Aim 2: will test whether RAS
imposes epigenetic changes that increase miR-181c expression in STCs. Aim 3: will test whether aberrant
miR-181c mitochondrial import contributes to STC dysfunction. Successful studies will provide novel insight
into the vulnerability of this repair system and may contribute towards development of feasible clinically
relevant tools for improving the utility and efficacy of kidney repair in renal disease."

Hypertension affects one billion people and is a principal reversible risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
Obesity which has become common in the US and throughout the world is a major cause of hypertension, but
the mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and hypertension remain largely unknown. The
goal of this proposal is to identify the neuronal and molecular processes that control blood pressure and how
dysregulation in these processes contribute to obesity-associated cardiovascular risks. This proposal is based
on the hypothesis that obesity-induced elevation in the hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) promotes
hypertension by activating ventromedial hypothalamic neurons expressing steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) to
increase sympathetic nerve activity. We will use a multidisciplinary strategy combining cutting edge neuro-
technologies to precisely and remotely modulate or monitor the activity of SF1 neurons in freely moving
animals with unique genetically engineered mouse models that permit selective modulation of FGF21 signaling
in SF1 neurons and sophisticated integrative physiology for sympathetic and cardiovascular phenotyping. We
plan to test our central hypothesis by determining how chemogenetic- or optogenetic-mediated activation or
inhibition of SF1 neuron activity affects sympathetic outflow and arterial pressure under normal conditions as
well as in obesity. We will also explore the contribution of FGF21 signaling in ventromedial hypothalamus
including SF1 neurons to sympathetic and arterial pressure control and obesity-associated hypertension and
sympathetic nerve activation. This work should unravel novel mechanisms that underlie obesity-associated
sympathetic activation and hypertension, making our work of high clinical relevance. Insights into the cellular
and molecular processes that control the sympathetic tone that regulates cardiovascular function may make it
possible to selectively interfere with the damage obesity inflicts on cardiovascular sympathetic functions."

The Connecticut (CT) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is designed
to provide the Department of Public Health (DPH) with important data about maternal
health, experiences, and behaviors during the perinatal period; advance knowledge about
risk and protective factors among CT mothers; and investigate the associations between
these factors and birth outcomes and maternal and infant health. Random samples are
drawn from birth records on a monthly basis. The sampling frame is limited to CT resident
women who delivered an infant in‐state within the preceding 2‐6 months. Reducing racial
and ethnic health disparities is central to all DPH programs and initiatives. The sample is
stratified by maternal race/ethnicity in order to produce separate estimates for population
subgroups, and to allow for meaningful comparisons to quantify and investigate disparities
in perinatal indicators. Data collection for each surveillance year spans 15 months, with a
total sample size of approximately 2,200 women. PRAMS employs a mixed‐mode data
collection methodology that includes a mail questionnaire with several follow‐up attempts,
followed by a telephone survey for mail non‐responders. CT PRAMS data will be
integrated into efforts to address state maternal and child health priorities, as well as
statewide plans and initiatives to reduce low birth weight, preterm birth, infant mortality,
and health disparities. Statewide partners will be utilized to inform the project and facilitate
wide dissemination of CT PRAMS findings."
10783736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vascular insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and dampening of insulin-induced
vasodilation is its primary consequence. Notably, in T2D, reduced insulin-stimulated vasodilation and blood
flow to tissues such as skeletal muscle significantly limits glucose uptake and contributes to impaired glucose
control. A detailed understanding of the precipitating factors and mechanisms underlying the defects in
vasodilator actions of insulin is critical for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at improving
glycemic control and protecting against cardiovascular disease. Based on our prior work and most recent and
exciting preliminary data, we propose the novel hypothesis that ADAM17-mediated shedding of the insulin
receptor alpha (IRα) from endothelial cells impairs insulin-stimulated vasodilation in T2D. We further propose
that the increased activity of endothelial ADAM17 is attributed to protein kinase-C (PKC) activation and
subsequent externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, which serves
to guide ADAM17 to its targeted substrates. As exogenous PS is a competitive inhibitor of ADAM17 sheddase
activity, we will also determine the efficacy of oral administration of PS for restoring vascular insulin sensitivity
in T2D patients. We will test our innovative hypotheses with gain- and loss-of-function genetic-manipulation
experiments in human cultured endothelial cells, in isolated resistance arteries harvested from patients
undergoing abdominal surgery, and in patients with T2D. Experimental results will determine the role of PS
externalization-ADAM17 activation-IRα shedding as a mechanism impairing the vasodilatory actions of insulin
in T2D. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which PKC causes the externalization of
PS and whether PS externalization is needed for PKC-dependent activation of ADAM17 in endothelial cells.
Next, in Aim 2, we will determine the role of ADAM17 activity in IRα shedding and subsequent impairment of
insulin-stimulated vasodilation in T2D. Finally, in Aim 3, we will perform a randomized double-blind clinical trial
to determine the therapeutic efficacy of oral administration of the competitive inhibitor of ADAM17 sheddase
activity, PS, on insulin-stimulated leg blood flow in patients with T2D. Our team is poised to move
cardiovascular and diabetes research forward with a project that will exert a sustained, powerful impact across
a number of levels of inquiry that are novel conceptually, mechanistically, methodologically, and
therapeutically. Indeed, this proposal represents a paradigm shift from our current mechanistic understanding
of vascular insulin resistance. Targeting ADAM17 activation holds extraordinary promise for correcting
vascular insulin resistance and ultimately preventing/treating T2D-associated metabolic and cardiovascular
diseases."
10802336,"SUMMARY
 Approaches to vascular regeneration and repair require specification of endothelial cells that are competent
to form functioning blood vessels. However, the process by which endothelial cells are specified from mesoder-
mal precursors remains poorly understood. A key transcriptional regulator of endothelial cell (EC) specification
is the ETS-family transcription factor ETV2. Our preliminary data shows that mesodermal progenitor cells
(MPCs), differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are rapidly and efficiently repro-
grammed by ETV2 into endothelial cell-like cells (iEC-Ms). These iEC-Ms exhibit properties of endothelial cells
in vitro, and assemble into perfused vascular networks in the in vivo microvascular graft assay. In contrast,
ETV2 expression directly in iPSCs yielded cells that expressed endothelial cell markers (iEC-Ps) and exhibited
a subset of endothelial cell properties in vitro, but did not form perfused vascular networks in microvascular
grafts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to use this experimental paradigm to define the mechanisms
by which ETV2 drives reprogramming to iECs, and to dissect the mechanisms by which the starting cell
type (MPC vs iPSCs) influences the functional properties of the resulting iECs.
 We propose 3 Specific Aims to achieve these goals: (1) To dissect the transcriptional regulatory landscape
of endothelial differentiation. (2) To determine the molecular mechanisms that limit functionality of iECs differ-
entiated directly from iPSCs. (3) To characterize the protein-protein interactions required for ETV2 to drive iEC
specification. To achieve these aims, we will use cutting edge technologies including single cell RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq, and proximity proteomics.
 Together, these studies will define the molecular mechanisms that underlie the earliest stages of endothe-
lial cell specification and that establish endothelial cell competence for interaction with support cells and forma-
tion of functional vessels. This fundamental knowledge will form the foundation for strategies to promote vessel
development in organ repair and regeneration."

Much of the world’s music has periodic rhythms with events repeating regularly in time, to which people clap,
move, and sing. The ability to detect and predict periodic auditory rhythms is central to the positive effects of
music-based therapies on a variety of neurological disorders, including improving phonological processing in
dyslexia, enhancing language recovery after stroke, and normalizing gait in Parkinson’s disease. Yet the neural
mechanisms underlying rhythm perception are not well understood, and progress is impeded by the lack of an
animal model that allows precise measurement and manipulation of neural circuits during rhythm perception.
Human neuroimaging studies indicate that perceiving periodic musical rhythms strongly engages the motor
planning system, including premotor cortex and basal ganglia, even when the listener is not moving or preparing
to move. Here, we test the hypothesis that the motor planning system is actively involved in learning to recognize
temporal periodicity and communicates predictions about the timing of periodic events to the auditory system.
We propose to take advantage of the well-described auditory-motor circuits in vocal learning songbirds and
leverage the mechanistic studies possible in an animal model to test these ideas. Like humans (and unlike non-
human primates), vocal learning birds have strong connections between motor planning regions and auditory
regions due to their reliance on complex, learned vocal sequences for communication. Auditory-motor circuits in
songbirds and humans have many structural and functional parallels. Recently, we showed that songbirds can
readily learn to recognize a fundamental periodic pattern (isochrony, or equal timing between events) and can
detect this pattern across a broad range of tempi. In Aim 1, we will test whether neural signals from premotor
regions play a causal role in this ability to flexibly recognize periodic rhythms. In Aim 2, by recording in auditory
cortex while reversibly silencing activity in a reciprocally connected premotor region, we will test whether
premotor signals influence auditory processing of periodic rhythms. In Aim 3, by recording activity in a premotor
region as birds learn to recognize isochrony as a global temporal pattern, we will determine whether premotor
neurons develop sensitivity to temporal regularity and exhibit activity that predicts the timing of upcoming events.
Establishing an animal model for rhythm perception will be transformative for music neuroscience, allowing
detailed investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying rhythm perception and informing rhythm-based
musical interventions to enhance function in normal and disease states."

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in a diverse array of critical biological processes,
including cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. To date, there is no general way to
modulate collagen protein-protein interactions, and many fundamental aspects of biomolecular
recognition are still unknown. Specifically, numerous interactions between collagen triple helices and
proteins are not fully characterized or understood. We have recently shown that collagen aza-peptides
in which at least one alpha-carbon atom has been substituted with nitrogen, have additional interstrand
hydrogen bonds in their collagen triple helix, resulting in hyperstability and more efficient self-assembly.
As a result, even short collagen aza-peptides reliably self-assemble into thermostable triple helices,
making them a promising choice for novel triple helix mimics. With this project, we propose to use
minimal aza-peptides to create linear and cyclic collagen peptide triple helix mimics. Our specific aims
are as follows: 1) Synthesize and characterize hyperstable synthetic mimics of collagen peptides; 2)
Synthesize and characterize cyclic collagen peptide triple helix mimics (CCP-mimics); 3) Characterize
protein interactions our synthetic collagen peptides. Aza-peptides will be synthesized using solid-phase
peptide synthesis (SPPS) in order to introduce aza-amino acids into the collagen backbone at precise
locations and optimize thermodynamic stability of the linear and cyclic peptides. The modular nature of
our new collagen peptide systems will provide highly tunable platforms into which any biologically
relevant protein binding sequence can be integrated. Our collagen peptide mimics will serve as new
chemical tools for understanding the fundamental biology and biochemistry of the collagen-protein
interactome. The proposed studies could ultimately serve as the fundamental science leading to future
biomedical treatments for pathologies in which precisely modulating collagen-protein interactions could
significantly enhance patient outcome."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic disorder characterized by progressive lung disease and airway obstruction.
CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Patients with CF often
develop airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) related to smooth muscle dysfunction, which worsens airway
obstruction and portends faster lung function decline. TGF is a genetic modifier of CF, with higher TGF levels
linked to more severe lung disease. TGF also causes worse AHR and smooth muscle abnormalities in CF mice
versus non-CF mice. It is unknown how TGF modifies CF lung disease or drives CF smooth muscle dysfunction.
This proposal seeks to investigate TGF’s role in CF airway smooth muscle dysfunction. Currently, no therapies
directly target smooth muscle abnormalities or TGF signaling in CF. This proposal investigates the overall
hypothesis that TGF regulates CFTR-mediated airway smooth muscle dysfunction through effects on both CF
epithelial and smooth muscle cells. CF animal and mouse/human primary cell culture models will be used to test
the tissue specific function of CFTR in TGF induced lung disease. Aim 1 will determine the role of CFTR
dysfunction in airway epithelial cells in mediating TGF-driven lung disease, using TGF exposed epithelial-
specific Cftr knockout mice and primary murine and human cell culture models. These studies will focus on
epithelial and inflammatory mediators. Aim 2 will test the mechanisms of TGF-induced CF airway smooth
muscle dysfunction by examining pulmonary and smooth muscle abnormalities in both smooth muscle-specific
Cftr knockout mice and isolated murine and human CF cell culture models. Tests of TGF-mediated AHR, lung
function, and smooth muscle contractility will be used to compare CF and non-CF airway smooth muscle function.
The PI for this proposal, Dr. Elizabeth Kramer, is a physician scientist in Pulmonary Medicine with a focus on
drivers of early CF lung disease. She has a Ph.D. in Molecular and Developmental Biology and an extensive
background in mouse models and lung physiology. Her mentors provide complimentary expertise in CF mouse

(Dr. J.P. Clancy, Co-mentor), and translational research design (Dr. Raouf Amin, Co-mentor). These mentors
have an established record of success in mentoring academic scientists. They are personally committed to Dr.
Kramer’s success in completing this proposal and transitioning to an independent research career.
The training plan outlined in this application will provide the applicant with crucial training in innovative laboratory
techniques, cutting-edge bioinformatics analysis, immunology, and advanced career skills to successfully
establish an independent translational science program. This training plan capitalizes on the excellent
environment and support at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Addressing these training goals and completing the
studies described in this application will build upon Dr. Kramer’s prior expertise in molecular and developmental
biology, providing a solid scientific and training platform to launch her independent research career."
10745997,"Chronic pain costs the US more than $635 billion per year, however, patients fail to receive adequate relief
from the available drugs and often become drug-dependent. These observations highlight the importance for
identifying new agents acting on unique targets to treat chronic pain. Genetic, neurobiological, and preclinical
studies have suggested that adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) may provide that new drug target. AC1 knock out
mice (AC1-/-) show reduced or absent inflammatory and neuropathic pain when compared to littermate controls.
Preclinical studies with a small molecule inhibitor of AC1, NB001 revealed that NB001 reduced chronic pain
responses (i.e. inflammatory and neuropathic) in both mice and rats. Similarly, we have recently shown that a
novel AC1 inhibitor, ST034307 also reduced inflammatory pain in a mouse model. These studies are consistent
with the premise that AC1 is a new target for inhibitors of chronic pain. Unfortunately, both NB001 and ST034307
have significant issues and liabilities preventing further development. To that end, we have recently screened a
chemical library collection that allowed us to identify a pyrimidinone scaffold for the development of novel AC1
inhibitors. This scaffold was prioritized for hit-to-lead optimization based on several promising criteria. Preliminary
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have revealed for the first time compounds with sub-micromolar
potency at AC1, as well as selectivity versus the closely-related AC8. Further, initial in vivo studies with a lead
compound reveal activity in an animal model of chronic pain. Despite these promising observations, the lead
compounds suffer from extremely low aqueous solubility. We propose medicinal chemistry optimization of this
scaffold to develop potent and selective inhibitors of AC1 activity as novel probes under the following Specific
Aims: Specific aim 1 will use medicinal chemistry optimization of the pyrimidinone scaffold to develop potent
drug-like AC1-selective molecular probes. Specific aim 2 will establish the pharmacological specificity of the
probe molecules using a set of in vitro model assays and explore the mechanisms for probe activity. Additionally,
we will execute in vivo preclinical pharmacokinetic testing with iterative medicinal chemistry and pharmacology.
Specific aim 3 will then use the best molecules to explore the in vivo pharmacological activity of the AC1 inhibitors
in a mouse model of inflammatory pain, conditioned place preference, and opioid withdrawal. At the end of this
study, we shall provide the research community with chemical probes with < 100 nM AC1 potency, > 30-fold
selectivity vs other ACs and related CNS targets, and in vivo efficacy. These new probes will provide essential
tools to validate AC1 as a new and safe drug target in the treatment of chronic pain."
10791932,"SPECIFIC AIMS: Obesity-induced metabolic inflammation results in the transition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to steatohepatitis (NASH) [1-3]. Myeloid cell populations such as macrophages have been established as the main driver of metabolic inflammation [4-10]. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have provided a high-resolution fate map of myeloid diversity in NAFLD associated with distinct epigenomes, transcriptomes, and functions [9-11]. Recent advances emphasize the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression at the RNA level in obesity-driven hepatic inflammation [12, 13]. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation represents the most prevalent and abundant epigenetic modification of eukaryotic mRNA. m6A methylation is dynamically installed, erased, and recognized by m6A methyltransferases (writers), m6A demethylases (erasers), and m6A specific binding enzymes (readers) [14, 15]. Highly m6A modified transcripts generally result in lower mRNA stability leading to reduced mRNA levels and thus greatly influence diverse cellular and biological responses [16-18]. The reader proteins recognize the m6A-modified sequences and determine the fate of the target mRNA. We recently identified that myeloid lineage-restricted deletion of m6A writer protein methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) results in differential expression of m6A modified mRNA transcripts, particularly DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4) that negatively regulates mTOR/NFkB activation resulting in decreased immune cell infiltration, recovered liver homeostasis, improved hepatic metabolic abnormalities, and reduced inflammation during diet-induced obesity/NAFLD [19]. Although macrophage METTL3 plays an essential role in obesity-associated NAFLD, how it competes and collaborates with distinct m6A readers has not been identified, nor has the specificity of the methylation reaction and RNA structural motif determined. The molecular and cellular effects of m6A methylation in myeloid cell subsets, in addition to reducing mRNA stability, have yet to be elucidated in advanced fibrosis. 
 DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 plays multifaceted roles in ribosome biogenesis, RNA editing, RNA transport, and transcription. DDX21 has been reported to interact with m6A writer proteins. Analysis of publicly available RNA-CLIP sequencing data indicates the overlap between DDX21 binding regions and m6A methylation sites on target mRNA molecules. Our preliminary results showed that mice with DDX21 deficiency in myeloid lineage, analogous to METTL3 deficiency, resulted in significant prevention of diet-induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis. The scRNA-seq analysis revealed two distinct myeloid populations, liver-resident (KC-H) macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-M), that have opposite proportional mobilization between chow and diet-fed mice. The lack of DDX21 restored the proportion of KC-H in diet-fed mice while reducing the proportion of Mo-M along with reduced inflammatory markers, indicating DDX21 plays a novel role in liver myeloid cells during obesity-associated NAFLD. Therefore, we hypothesize that mRNA m6A methylation in myeloid cell subsets, in association with DDX21, leads to hepatic inflammation during obesity-associated NAFLD (Fig.1). 
Aim 1 Establish the role of METTL3 in myeloid cell-driven hepatic inflammation during obesity-associated NAFLD. 1.1) Determine the contributions of METTL3 in KC-H and Mo-M subsets to hepatic inflammation. 1.1.1) Obtain the transcriptome-wide map of dynamic mRNA m6A at single-nucleotide resolution in METTL3-deficient KC-H and Mo-M cells during diet-induced NAFLD. 1.1.2). Identify the myeloid subset in which METTL3 deficiency results in protection from metabolic inflammation. This aim will identify the m6A pathway in myeloid subsets and downstream genes that contribute to hepatic inflammation during obesity-associated NAFLD. Aim 2 Determine the mechanistic relationship between the RNA helicase DDX21 and the m6A methylation to myeloid cell-driven hepatic inflammation. 2.1) Determine DDX21 recognition of m6A methylation on mRNAs. 2.2) Determine the role of DDX21 in myeloid lineage to promote obesity-associated steatohepatitis and fibrosis. This aim will mechanistically uncover DDX21 as a novel m6A regulator, and potential therapeutic target for obesity-associated NAFLD. 
This application will elucidate novel regulatory organisms underlying the role of m6A methylation in hepatic inflammation under obesity-associated NAFLD. The identification of DDX21 as a key role in liver myeloid subpopulations to prevent hepatic inflammation will provide the rationale for manipulating DDX21 and the basis for applying small molecules targeting m6A modulators in metabolic liver disease."

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB), characterized by snoring and sleep disruption, affects one in ten children.
Adverse outcomes of SDB such as problem behaviors, sleepiness, and lower quality of life contribute to poor
classroom performance and are thought to be related to structural and functional alterations within the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) of the brain. All clinical societies therefore support universal screening for SDB in children and its
treatment by removal of tonsils and adenoids (adenotonsillectomy or ‘AT’), a surgery performed in 500,000 chil-
dren annually in the United States alone. However, some children also experience spontaneous resolution of
SDB and therefore watchful waiting is also an acceptable treatment option for these children. Currently there are
no uniformly accepted criteria for children likely to benefit from AT as opposed to watchful waiting. Polysomnog-
raphy is currently used for stratification of SDB severity. However, polysomnographic parameters neither corre-
late with behavior, cognition, or quality of life nor the outcomes of AT in children with SDB. Therefore, two major
gaps in knowledge exist, which include the lack of (i) understanding the mechanism by which AT impacts SDB
outcomes, and (ii) a predictive model for selection of children likely to benefit from AT. Addressing these gaps
could improve patient selection, reduce harm, and increase parental satisfaction related to one of the most com-
mon pediatric surgical procedures.
We have shown that the relationship between SDB and children’s behavior is mediated by structural alterations
within or close to the PFC. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we have further demonstrated
that regional brain activation within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) correlates with behavioral measures in children
with SDB. Using a range of data science techniques, we have additionally shown that polysomnographic param-
eters do not predict SDB or AT outcomes. Here we propose the use of a novel biomarker for functional activation
of the PFC using fNIRS and baseline patient characteristics to predict outcomes of children undergoing SDB
treatment. In 200 children undergoing management of SDB by early AT or a strategy of watchful waiting at two
large and diverse clinical practices, our specific aims include: Aim 1) To determine the extent to which cognitive
outcomes of AT are mediated by PFC activation, Aim 2) To determine the extent to which parent-reported out-
comes of AT are mediated by PFC activation, and Aim 3) To develop a predictive model for SDB treatment
outcomes using demographic, anthropometric, polysomnographic, and fNIRS variables. Using a multidisciplinary
approach with world-class expertise in data science approaches, this proposal seeks to address gaps in our
mechanistic understanding of AT outcomes and establish an objective, child-friendly, and cost-effective ap-
proach for identification of surgical candidates."

Several anticancer agents cause a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that can permanently diminish
patient’s functional ability and quality of life. Since there are no effective strategies to prevent or treat
peripheral neuropathy, clinical practice guidelines recommend withholding or dose-reducing chemotherapy,
which reduces patient survival. Clinical and lifestyle factors do not adequately predict risk of taxane-induced
peripheral neuropathy (TIPN). Therefore, there is a critical need to validate clinically useful and mechanistically
informative predictive TIPN biomarkers in order to develop effective TIPN prevention strategies that improve
taxane treatment outcomes. Dysregulation of nutrients including vitamin D, histidine, and sphingomyelin, and
variants in genes linked to hereditary neuropathy conditions, have been identified as candidate biomarkers of
TIPN. Confirming these biomarker candidates as predictors of TIPN risk requires a large cohort of taxane-
treated patients with biospecimens and detailed TIPN data. The overarching objective of this proposal is to
identify clinically-useful and mechanistically-informative TIPN biomarkers and develop an Integrated TIPN Risk
Prediction Model that can predict an individual patient’s TIPN risk. We will extend the value of SWOG 1714
(S1714), which is a large (n=1,336) NCI-funded prospective clinical study that collected biospecimens and
detailed TIPN data to create a Clinical TIPN Prediction Model. Our central hypothesis is that our physiologic
(e.g., vitamin D, histidine, sphingomyelin) and genetic (e.g., EPHA5) biomarker candidates are predictive TIPN
biomarkers and will enrich the Clinical TIPN Prediction Model. We will conduct targeted and comprehensive
“omics” analyses of S1714 biospecimens to validate clinically useful and mechanistically informative predictive
TIPN biomarkers and develop an Integrated TIPN Risk Prediction Model to complete the following specific
aims: Aim 1: Assess the predictive value of key nutrients and lipids on TIPN risk. Aim 2: Determine
genetic features that contribute to TIPN risk. Aim 3: Develop an Integrated TIPN Prediction Model. The
primary expected outcomes of this research are the: 1) confirmation of clinically useful predictive TIPN
biomarkers, 2) generation of new knowledge of the mechanistic processes that contribute to TIPN, and 3)
creation of an Integrated TIPN Prediction Model. These outcomes will provide critical insight to develop novel
agents and biomarker-informed treatment strategies that the study team can test in prospective clinical trials to
prevent TIPN. If successful, these strategies could be translated into clinical practice to prevent TIPN and
improve long-term clinical outcomes in the nearly one million patients with cancer who receive taxane
treatment each year in the United States."
10904614,"Overall Project Summary/Abstract: Molecular mechanisms of filoviral-host interactions
The family Filoviridae, which includes Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are zoonotic pathogens
that cause outbreaks of severe human disease and require biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment for study.
Recent approval of a vaccine and antibody-based therapies against an EBOV represent progress towards
medical countermeasures. However, the family is comprised of multiple antigenically distinct species, making
identification of pan-filoviral therapeutic approaches desirable. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms required
for replication and pathogenesis are incompletely understood. Defining key filovirus-host interactions and the
mechanisms by which they promote viral growth and disease will provide important insight into viral biology and
suggest new therapeutic approaches. Existing data, including our own, have identified key host-viral interactions
that likely play important roles in the pathogenesis of filovirus disease. Our overarching goal is to address this
gap in knowledge by building and expanding upon the strong foundational knowledge on EBOV to define
molecular mechanisms at the host-pathogen interface and to identify EBOV-specific and pan-filoviral interactions
that contribute to pathogenesis. To achieve our goals, we have assembled a highly accomplished team with
track records of effective synergistic collaboration and expertise ranging from molecular biochemistry, structural
biology and mass spectrometry to cell biology, virology, and work at BSL4. In the current funding period, we
identified multiple host pathways that impact EBOV infection and defined key interactions at the viral-host
interface. In our proposed studies, we use a reductionist approach to define molecular mechanisms by
biochemical and structural methods (Project 1; RP01), determine the cellular impact and contributions of viral
proteins such as VP30 and VP24 in immune response, viral replication, assembly and egress (Project 2; RP02),
and evaluate the impact of specific interactions with EBOV and MARV virus in cell culture and in vivo, including
specific subnetworks that regulate filoviral entry and replication (Project 3; RP03). Recognizing the complexity
of the data being generated we have recruited new expertise in proteomics and genetic network analysis to
provide a deeper understanding of host-virus protein connectivity and interaction. These efforts will be further
supported by two scientific cores, the Antibody and Reagent Development Core B and the BSL4/ABSL4
laboratory Core C. This work will be guided by an active Administrative Core A that will receive critical input from
the Core A Advisory Group (CAAG) and the External Advisory Board (EAB). Each is comprised of preeminent
scientists in academia and industry with strong productivity in emerging infectious diseases and immunology and
significant advisory experience. Building on our productive initial work, we are poised to define a comprehensive
host interaction network, validate regulatory mechanisms that drive viral infection, and identify targets for
therapeutic intervention. Our unique innovative experimental framework and highly interactive scientific
approach provides a blueprint to tackle other emerging and reemerging pathogens."
10784706,"ABSTRACT: Visual pigments initiate the human visual experience, making them of great physiological interest,
and also are affected in retinal diseases. Accordingly, numerous research efforts have been devoted to
characterizing their structure-function relationships. Despite these efforts, critical gaps remain in our
understanding of visual pigment photochemistry and signaling properties. Knowledge of this fundamental visual
physiology is necessary to make accelerated progress in developing treatments for associated retinopathies. At
the heart of all visual pigments is a retinaldehyde chromophore that undergoes a cis-trans isomerization upon
absorption of a photon of a suitable wavelength. This complex reaction, which proceeds through several
photointermediates, triggers the conformational changes necessary for the propagation of a light stimulus into a
biochemical response. This photoactivation process ends with the hydrolysis and release of retinaldehyde, which
is required for renewal of the receptor light-sensitive state and hence continuous visual function. Fundamental
questions remain regarding receptor structure, mechanisms and modulators of hydrolysis of the retinaldehyde
Schiff base, and the modes of interaction of small molecule therapeutic candidates.
Here, we will pursue four specific aims that employ newly developed tools and approaches that we believe will
overcome previously insurmountable experimental challenges. 1) Elucidate structures of rhodopsin
photointermediates stabilized by nanobodies. Using a novel series of camelid antibodies that arrest the
rhodopsin photocycle, we will perform a detailed structure-function characterization of metarhodopsin
intermediates. 2) Define the kinetics of hydrolysis of the retinaldehyde chromophores of rhodopsin and cone
opsin pigments in native membranes. We have developed a novel mass spectrometry-based method that can,
for the first time, directly detect the retinal conjugation state of visual pigments in native membranes; we will
use this method to determine key rate constants necessary to model the interplay between visual pigment
bleaching cycles and the regenerative visual cycles. 3) Assess the influence of cytosolic effectors and visual
cycle components on the rate of hydrolysis of rhodopsin chromophore in knockout mouse models. Using the
methods described in Aim 2, we will characterize the rate of Schiff base hydrolysis in Arr1-/-, Grk1-/-, Abca4-/-,
and Rdh8-/- mice, providing new insights into how light and dark adaptation are modulated by
phototransduction and visual cycle proteins. 4) Characterize the molecular architecture of rhodopsin
complexes with lipids and small molecules using native mass spectrometry. Using the native MS technique, we
will quantify phospholipids that associate with rhodopsin in its various activation states. We will also validate
the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of small molecule therapeutic candidates in vivo. We believe the
information gleaned from these studies will enhance our understanding of retinal diseases at the molecular
level and enable the development of novel strategies for their treatment."
10786056,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity causes the greatest proportional risk for diabetes, heart disease, and cancer and is resistant to current
treatments despite being a focus of intense research. Obesity occurs because the body stores surplus calories
as fat, which in turn drives the health risks associated with obesity6-10. The current therapeutic approaches to
obesity focus on weight loss, via caloric restriction and/or exercise, which are not effective. An alternate strategy
would be to redirect surplus calories to build muscle instead of storage as fat. This approach would mitigate the
health risks of obesity and also improve daily functioning, quality of life, and longevity. Our intriguing preliminary
data reveal that high-dose dietary vitamin D decreases the proportion of excess calories stored as fat, instead
allocating these calories to muscle. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this finding will drive the
development of novel therapeutic approaches desperately needed to prevent and treat obesity. Further, our
preliminary results suggest that this calorie allocation to muscle occurs via 25D mediated vitamin D receptor
(VDR) transcriptional regulation at non-canonical VDR binding sites.
Our long term goal is to define the roles of vitamin D in calorie allocation in order to identify novel therapeutic
targets in obesity. The specific objectives of this project are 1) to determine which dietary vitamin D metabolite,
25D or 1,25D, signals to allocate calories to muscle, and 2) to identify the mechanisms in muscle whereby vitamin
D signaling leads to changes in gene expression underlying calorie allocation. Using mouse models, we have
demonstrated that high-dose dietary vitamin D increases muscle mass, cross sectional area, strength/area, and
muscle mitochondrial capacity in both lean and obese mice. Our central hypothesis is that high-dose vitamin
D calorie allocation is mediated by 25D acting via the VDR to alter transcription through non-canonical binding
sites. Our approach uses validated genetically engineered mouse models of vitamin D imbalance, and connects
signaling to transcriptional changes by genome-wide analysis of VDR binding.
In sum, this proposal describes a five-year research plan to understand the mechanisms underlying non-
calciometabolic actions of vitamin D to preferentially allocate calories to muscle instead of fat with the long-term
goal of developing novel rational therapies for obesity. The primary investigator is an Assistant Professor on the
tenure track at the University of Pennsylvania. He is an early career researcher dedicated to asking translational
questions to better understand non-calciometabolic actions of vitamin D. He has assembled a uniquely qualified
and complementary collaborative team to tackle the objectives of this application. Successful completion of this
work will define the role of 25D in mediating vitamin D muscle calorie allocation and will identify relevant signaling
pathways that could be targeted therapeutically to preferentially allocate surplus calories to muscle instead of
fat, thereby decreasing both unwanted effects and incidence of obesity."

 Astrocytes are evolutionarily conserved glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that play a crucial
role in neuronal circuit development and function. Mature astrocytes exhibit remarkably ramified and complex
morphology and closely associate with neuronal synapses throughout the brain. Diazepam binding inhibitor
(DBI) is a protein that has been shown to be highly enriched in glial cells, including astrocytes, in mouse and
human brains. We recently discovered that it is also highly expressed by Drosophila astrocytes, suggesting its
crucial and evolutionarily conserved role in astrocyte function. DBI and its proteolytic neuropeptide,
Octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), have been shown to bind to the benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site on GABAA
receptors and modulate the strength of inhibitory signaling, acting as endogenous ligands of BZD
(endozepines). As BZDs are among the most widely prescribed treatments for anxiety disorders and seizures,
understanding the astrocytic endozepine signaling will provide insights into how astrocytes can regulate the
proper maturation and function of neuronal circuitry, and how the brain responds to BDZs. Another proteolytic
fragment of DBI, triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN), binds to translocator protein (TSPO) receptor on the outer
mitochondrial membrane and is involved in mitochondrial cholesterol transport, cytoskeletal dynamics, and
Ca2+ homeostasis, all of which are critical for astrocyte morphogenesis and function.
 Employing a synergistic combination of molecular-genetic tools available in Drosophila and zebrafish, this
proposal aims to: determine whether DBI signaling is required for normal astrocyte development (Aim 1);
define cell-intrinsic function of TTN-TSPO signaling in astrocyte mitochondrial and Ca2+ dynamics (Aim 2); and
investigate the role of astrocytic DBI signaling in neuronal circuit maturation in the context of the excitatory-
inhibitory (E/I) balance. This work will elucidate evolutionarily conserved function of DBI signaling in astrocyte
development and astrocyte-neuron interactions in vivo and could provide novel insights into the role of
astrocytes in anxiety disorders and epilepsy."

Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have greatly improved the treatment of inflammatory joint
disease but cause generalized immunosuppression and increase the risk of serious infections and cancer. The
pathogenic inflammation, a hallmark of autoimmune arthritis, can largely be ascribed to a deficiency in
regulatory immune function. There is a critical need for anti-arthritic agents that can operate without impairing
the immune system, which could also be combined with current DMARDs in patients who struggle to achieve
durable remission. Towards this goal, the objective of the grant application is to validate a new strategy of
intra-articularly (IA) drug delivery of an immunomodulatory agent that could promote durable disease remission
in autoimmune arthritis without causing generalized suppression of immunity. Our agent leverages pre-existing
regulatory T cells (Treg), widely recognized as the primary suppressors of autoreactive T cells, to promote a
disease modifying anti-inflammatory effect. Recognizing that Treg are often insufficiently recruited to the
inflamed joints, display abnormal levels of inflammation-induced instability and loss of function, our approach
achieves localized expansion and stabilization of joint Treg and results in reduced inflammation and systemic
disease modification in affected joints of arthritic mice without causing generalized immunosuppression. Here,
we will validate our approach as a therapeutic option for inflammatory arthritis. In Aim 1 we will optimize our
approach such that it durably enhances the magnitude and function of Treg for modulating inflammation. In Aim
2, we will systematically validate the mechanism of action of our agent and demonstrate the enhancement of
disease-relevant Treg without suppressing non-specific T cell responses. In Aim 3, we will assess the adjunctive
potential of our approach with a widely used first-line DMARD to reduce disease severity in mice that show
partial DMARD responsiveness and assess whether the agent is effective in the ex-vivo enhancement of Treg
isolated from DMARD-treated arthritis patients. Overall, these studies will advance our long-term goal of
developing our approach to correct pathogenic immune dysregulation in autoimmune disorders affecting the
joint and other tissues, arising from insufficient Treg function."
10881691,"Project Summary: The poor survival rates in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients are in part due to poor
response to existing therapies. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies. NK cell-based therapies
present a promising option because NK cells primarily target tumor cells through direct killing or IFN-gamma
production and are not dependent on MHC expression. However, in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells
directly compete with tumor cells for nutrients to maintain basal cellular metabolism. Of note, cellular metabolic
pathways are closely linked with the effector response of NK cells. Tumor-educated NK cells demonstrate
increased glycolysis, which potentiates their cytotoxic activity. However, the complete spectrum of metabolic
reprogramming in NK cells is not fully understood. Pancreatic tumors are highly glycolytic. The tumor cells exhibit
constant high demand for glucose or glutamine to fuel the anabolic needs and exhaust the essential nutrients in
the tumor microenvironment milieu. Nutrient starvation triggers metabolic alterations to support proliferation and
the aggressive phenotype of pancreatic tumors. Hence, the pancreatic tumor microenvironment displays nutrient
paucity, which restricts the metabolic flux in NK cells. Our preliminary data suggest the scarcity of vitamin B6 in
NK-tumor cell co-cultures becomes a limiting factor for the anti-tumor response of NK cells against pancreatic
tumor cells and organoids. Furthermore, vitamin B6 paucity and glucose-limitation induce metabolic rewiring in
NK cells to sustain glycolysis and downstream metabolic pathways. Of note, tumor progression causes a
systemic imbalance of vitamin B6. We observed a significant reduction in systemic vitamin B6 metabolites in
PDAC patients. Moreover, we demonstrate that pancreatic tumor cells display increased metabolic flux and
dependence on metabolic pathways that are dispensable for NK cells, providing a metabolic vulnerability that
can be targeted in combination with vitamin B6 supplementation. Taken together, we posit that pancreatic tumor
cells exhaust vitamin B6 in the tumor microenvironment milieu, impacting cellular metabolism and inducing NK
cell dysfunction. We will examine (Specific Aim 1) the metabolic pathways that favor tumor cell-mediated vitamin
B6 exhaustion in the PDAC TME milieu to sustain tumor cell proliferation under nutrient-limiting conditions. In
Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the functional significance of vitamin B6-induced metabolic remodeling in
NKs that regulate the anti-tumor response of NK cells in 2D cultures, organoids, and orthotopic mouse models.
We will also examine the therapeutic potential of targeting the selective metabolic dependencies of tumor cells,
in combination with vitamin B6 supplementation, in the context of nutrient limitation in the tumor
microenvironment in orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models (Specific Aim 3). Overall, our study will
investigate the metabolic competition between pancreatic cancer cells and NK cells for understanding the
selective metabolic vulnerabilities for developing robust NK-based therapies in the long run."
10843731,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The objective of this R01 proposal is to investigate the function of lung-derived complement proteins and harness
their activities to mitigate the severity of pneumonia. Complement proteins C3 and Factor B (FB) comprise an
early arm of the host immune response. They are primarily derived from the liver and function in the circulation
by killing pathogens such as bacteria. However, our recent work has demonstrated the importance of local C3
expression in lung epithelial cell survival during stress. This proposal focuses on an emerging role for lung-
derived FB, a ligand for C3, in reducing excessive tissue damage in the setting of an acute bacterial pneumonia.
Our goal is to determine how FB promotes pulmonary host defense. We will investigate sources of FB in the
lung and establish its putative protective effect relative to C3. A major hurdle for investigating tissue-specific
roles of complement has been the limited availability of models and assays. We have developed novel transgenic
mouse models and functional assays that distinguish the roles of liver- and lung-derived complement proteins,
and specifically identify the role of lung-derived FB in pneumonia. Our mouse models are supplemented with
data from in vitro human models that demonstrate the role of FB to protect against stress-induced epithelial cell
death. Additionally, CRISPR-induced deletion of cell-derived complement proteins suggests active
internalization of exogenous complement proteins. These combined results support our central hypothesis that
lung-derived FB promotes host defense by mitigating epithelial cell death. This proposal will test our
hypothesis by achieving two Specific Aims. Aim 1 compares global FB-deficient, targeted liver FB-deficient, and
lung epithelial cell-derived FB-deficient mice to assess how lung-derived FB mitigates acute bronchopneumonia
severity and cell death. We also will assess if augmenting FB in the lung using pharmacological and gene delivery
approaches protects against pneumonia. Aim 2 analyzes whether lung-derived, intracellular FB activity mitigates
cell death in vitro by leveraging a combination of human primary lung epithelial cells and FB-deficient cells to
dissect the molecular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for complement function in the lung. The
proposal integrates knowledge of pulmonary complement activation, intracellular complement protein trafficking,
and structure-function relationships with gene therapy, cell imaging, proteomics, and CRISPR screens to
determine how lung-derived FB promotes epithelial cytoprotection during stress. These approaches are
independent but complementary for investigating the immunobiological role of lung-derived FB in mucosal barrier
protection of the lung. The proposed work is important because understanding how the early host immune
response modulates tissue damage is essential for designing and implementing urgently needed, new therapies
for pneumonia. Thus, we will assess how lung-derived FB facilitates host defense at the site of infection and
promotes tissue resilience. These efforts will help our long-term goal of developing a novel host-focused therapy
for pneumonia, thus aligning with a priority area of the NHLBI Working Group Report on pneumonia research."
10746451,"ABSTRACT
 Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is characterized by focal narrowing of the aorta that increases the risk
for sudden cardiac death. SVAS is caused by mutations in the elastin gene that lead to decreased elastin
amounts and there are currently no pharmaceutical treatments. The mechanisms by which elastin insufficiency
cause SVAS are not well understood. Elastin is a critical mechanical component of the aorta and contributes to
the passive stiffness (or modulus) that determines how much the aorta will deform (or strain) under applied
hemodynamic stresses. Strain on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the aortic wall affects differentiation,
proliferation, and migration. Cellular transmembrane channels, including Piezo1/2, are mechanosensitive
molecules that transduce mechanical changes (such as strain) into biological effects (such as differentiation).
Activation of Piezo channels leads to increases in intracellular calcium that can stimulate nuclear translocation
of YAP/TAZ, which are transcriptional regulators of target genes including Ctgf. Ctgf is a known modulator of
SMC phenotype that encourages dedifferentiation, migration, and proliferation - all characteristics affected by
strain that may contribute to SVAS. Preliminary data in our unique SVAS mouse model (TaglnCre;Elnf/f) show
a reduced aortic modulus that may increase SMC strain, increased Piezo2 and Ctgf expression in aortic SMCs,
and a dedifferentiated aortic SMC phenotype. We hypothesize that SVAS is caused by altered SMC
mechanotransduction when enough elastin is not laid down to stiffen the aortic wall and prevent increased
SMC strain as stress increases with blood pressure during development. Increased SMC strain causes
overexpression/activation of Piezo2, leading to increased intracellular calcium, nuclear translocation of
YAP/TAZ, and increased Ctgf transcription that causes SMC phenotype modulation contributing to stenosis.
We will address our hypothesis through three complementary aims using TaglnCre;Elnf/f mice and human
SMCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from SVAS patients. In Aim 1, we will measure the global
and local elastic modulus of TaglnCre;Elnf/f aorta and SMC strain under physiologic loading conditions at
different developmental time points (before and after stenosis formation) and correlate these results with
changes in SMC phenotype as measured by single cell RNA-Seq. In Aim 2, we will apply strain to mouse aorta
and mouse and human SMCs and measure Piezo2 expression and activity. We will chemically and genetically
alter Piezo2 expression/activity and determine effects on in vitro calcium signaling and in vivo stenosis
severity. In Aim 3, we will chemically and genetically manipulate Piezo2 expression/activity, YAP/TAZ
localization, and Ctgf amounts in mouse aorta and mouse and human SMCs and determine the effects on
SMC phenotype and stenosis severity. Our results will be important for identifying new pharmaceutical
strategies that may prevent SMC phenotype changes in response to elastin insufficiency and treat SVAS.

Mitochondria provide 90% of our energy; defects in mitochondria lead to a wide range of diseases including
seizures, stroke, heart disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Far from their static kidney-bean shaped
depiction in many textbooks, mitochondria form a dynamic three-dimensional network that spans the entire
volume of the cell. This network undergoes continuous remodeling through fission and fusion, motility, biogenesis
and clearance. Under stress or disease conditions, the mitochondrial network fragments and changes its
dynamic equilibrium. Understanding this equilibrium, and its changes and adjustments to disease, is an
archetypical question in quantitative cellular organelle biology. The dynamic mitochondrial network has so far
evaded experimental interrogation and modeling as mitochondria were too small and too fast for volumetric
fluorescence microscopy. Fortunately, recent advances in imaging technology, namely lattice light-sheet
microscopy (LLSM), have changed that. Substantial preliminary data in this application supports the working
hypothesis that a combination of quantitative LLSM image processing, and particle based spatial modeling can
succeed in creating the first four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal model of the mitochondrial network. The goal
of the proposed work is to elucidate the fundamental biophysical principles of mitochondrial network
homeostasis. We have outlined three aims that will enable us to close this knowledge gap.
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that deep learning-based mitochondria segmentation will demonstrate more
accurate extraction of the 4D mitochondrial network from LLSM data as compared to traditional methods. New
deep neural network architectures will be developed to test this hypothesis. It is expected that a tool will be
delivered that generalizes across diverse imaging conditions and diverse mitochondrial form and function
impaired conditions.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that graph-based topological linking will demonstrate the first temporal tracking of
the 4D mitochondrial network. New linear assignment problem-based algorithms will be developed to precisely
track the mitochondrial network backbone as well as its fission/fusion events. It is expected that a tool will be
delivered that can track the mitochondrial network in a variety of imaging conditions and mitochondrial form and
function impaired conditions.
Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that morphology, dynamics, and function of the mitochondrial network are linked
and can be predicted. A new particle-based polymer simulation model will be developed based on 4D graph
temporal analysis of experimental data. It is expected that the first 4D spatio-temporal model of the mitochondrial
network will be developed that can predict form and function observables and their time evolution from first
principles."
10792608,"Underage drinking causes tremendous burden, and there is an urgent need to understand who is vulnerable,
and why/how, to facilitate accurate detection and prevention. Exposure to interpersonal trauma (e.g., physical
or sexual abuse) is a well-established risk factor for alcohol problems in youth; however, the developmental
mechanisms through which trauma leads to alcohol use are unclear. In addition, millions of youth experience
interpersonal trauma but only a subset develop alcohol use disorder (AUD). Identifying these high-risk youth,
and the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to their risk, can pinpoint objective early intervention targets
and aid in AUD prevention. Data from the Early Stage Investigator (ESI) PI suggests that youth with
interpersonal trauma exposure and high levels of aversive reactivity to unpredictable threats (U-threat;
temporally unpredictable and/or ambiguous) are at the greatest risk for the development of alcohol problems
in young adulthood. To date, however, a mechanistic test of this hypothesis has never been conducted in a
high-risk, trauma-exposed sample. The overarching goal of the study is to therefore validate a novel
neurobiological risk phenotype for alcohol problems in trauma-exposed youth using multimodal U-threat
reactivity data. Leveraging our unique access to high-risk youth in the central Ohio area, we will recruit a
cohort of 200, 16-19 year olds, with and without a history of interpersonal trauma exposure (125 with trauma
and 75 without) and conduct multimodal (neural function, physiology, behavior, and self-report) assessments
of U-threat reactivity and alcohol use. Six months after baseline we will conduct a second multimodal lab
assessment of U-threat reactivity. Every 3 months post-baseline we will assess youths’ alcohol use and
relevant psychiatric symptoms and behaviors via online survey (up to 24-months). This innovative,
longitudinal design will allow for a well-controlled test of whether interpersonal trauma exposure and
neurobiological reactivity to U-threat synergistically interact to predict escalations in alcohol use in youth (Aim
1). The study will also address whether reactivity to U-threat is a stable risk factor for alcohol problems or a
modifiable target that corresponds to changes in drinking behaviors over time (Aim 2). If reactivity to U-threat
does indeed track behavior, it can be used as an objective, mechanistic target for future ‘Fast-Fail’ treatment
studies. Lastly, given our multi-layered approach, we will conduct innovative analyses to integrate data across
‘units of analysis’ (brain, physiology, behavior, self-report) to predict the onset of alcohol problems in trauma-
exposed youth and develop a new and replicable predictor with the highest accuracy performance (Aim 3).
Findings from this work will provide critical new knowledge aiding in the identification of youth most at-risk for
alcohol problems. The study will also validate a mechanistic, neurobiological risk model that identifies targets
for intervention during a peak developmental risk window for alcohol use to ultimately help reduce the burden
of AUD in this high-risk population."
10783796,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic condition associated with substantial functional
deficits as well as risk for poorer mental and physical health over the lifespan. Although ADHD symptoms often
emerge during preschool, most children are not identified or treated during this developmental stage, missing
the critical window in which early intervention may have the greatest impact on ADHD symptom trajectories.
Additionally, even when evidence-based preschool behavioral interventions (behavioral parent training [BPT])
are delivered, treatment effects on core ADHD symptoms are inconsistent. One explanation is BPT's primary
focus on ameliorating daytime impairment, whereas ADHD may be best understood as a 24-hour disorder with
deficits in both daytime function and nighttime sleep. Indeed, sleep is frequently dysregulated in school-aged
children with ADHD, is associated with increased ADHD morbidity (i.e., increased core ADHD symptom
severity and comorbidity, poorer cognition and functioning), and when enhanced via behavioral sleep medicine
(BSM), results in improved core ADHD symptoms. Our recent work has shown similar associations between
sleep and ADHD symptoms in a primary-care based sample of preschoolers, suggesting that regulating sleep
may represent a critical mechanism for early interventions seeking to alter ADHD symptom trajectories among
preschoolers at risk. Recognizing the powerful connection between sleep and ADHD early in life, there is a
critical need to adapt BPT to target behaviors across the 24-hour period in a single, efficient intervention via
integration with BSM, the first-line intervention for sleep regulation in this age group. In addition, it is essential
to optimize the delivery system to reach preschoolers at-risk for ADHD in real-world clinical care settings. For
the proposed project, we will develop and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week telehealth
intervention (Preschool Attention and Sleep Support; PASS) for preschoolers identified in primary care as at
risk for ADHD (i.e., with elevated symptoms). PASS combines proven behavioral interventions to tackle
daytime (via BPT) and nighttime (via BSM) ADHD impairments in a single, streamlined treatment. PASS will be
delivered by behavioral health care providers and will guide caregivers in applying the antecedent-behavior-
consequence (ABC) framework of BPT to reduce daytime behavior concerns and support sleep regulation. We
will also evaluate the short-term effectiveness of PASS on core ADHD symptoms, functional outcomes, and
comorbidity compared to BPT. Finally, we will examine whether PASS impacts the hypothesized target
mechanism, sleep regulation via both actigraphy and caregiver report, and assess if improved sleep regulation
is associated with reduced core ADHD symptoms. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for an
adequately-powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of PASS to improve ADHD symptoms and sleep during
early childhood. From a public health perspective, improving attention and sleep during this critical
developmental period may have long-lasting impacts on ADHD trajectories as well as broader mental health."
10820562,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pilot and Feasibility Program
 The purpose of the Pilot and Feasibility Program (PFP) of the Washington University Diabetes
Research Center (DRC) is to provide, on a modest scale: (1) initial support for new investigators who do not
yet have their own peer-reviewed research support; (2) support for established investigators from other fields
of investigation to apply their expertise to diabetes-related research; and (3) support for established
investigators in diabetes embarking on an entirely new direction of research. An important goal of the PFP is to
allow these investigators to develop preliminary data sufficient to provide the basis for subsequent applications
for independent extramural research support. Following an annual competition, awards of up to $50,000 are
made to independent faculty level investigators with the potential for renewal for a second year contingent on
demonstrated progress. Grant applicants and recipients are mentored by the PFP Director and DRC Co-
Director, Dr. David Piston. A total of $250,000 of the annual DRC budget is committed to the PFP, and this
amount is supplemented with a minimum of $200,000 of direct annual institutional support, with
additional institutional support available for translational projects that include a research imaging
component. PFP funding spanning the last 10 years has predominantly supported early stage investigators
and led to 22 NIH R01 grants, 11 other NIH grants, and 9 foundation grants. During this past funding period,
the PFP supported 65 publications. The PFP is a highly productive component of the DRC with an emphasis
on mentoring and funding young faculty, and attracting established investigators from other fields into diabetes-
related research."

10721361,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US and disproportionally affects
Veterans. Although targeted therapies for lung adenocarcinoma improve overall survival, no similar
advances have been made in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC), which represents 30% of cases,
strongly associated with smoking, and highly metastatic. In contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy has some success in treating LUSC patients. However, majority of patients do not respond to
such treatment. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to better understand LUSC and develop new
treatments in this subclass of lung cancer that is refractory to molecular targeted therapies.
In searching for vulnerabilities in squamous lung cancer, we recently re-analyzed TCGA LUSC
datasets. We found that while individual driver mutations are rare, PIK3CA mutation/amplification,
PTEN deletion, and RICTOR amplification combined accounts for more than 40% of the LUSC
tumors. As both PI3K and PTEN regulates PIP3 levels, which activates mTORC2 and AKT, these
findings indicate that PI3K-AKT pathway is hyperactive, and targeting mTORC2 may inhibit the entire
pathway in the LUSC tumors.
In this application, we discovered that mTORC2 loss-of-function (LOF) significantly altered tumor
metabolism, inhibited tumor growth in vivo, and impacted antitumor immune environment. Further, we
found that selective inhibition of mTORC1 in vascular endothelium increases tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes. Thus, the combination of endothelial mTORC1 inhibition coupled with tumor inhibition
of mTORC2 will create a favorable microenvironment for anti-tumor immunity, enhancing T-cell
recruitment (mTORC1) and activity (mTORC2), providing a targeted therapy treatment strategy for
LUSC. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of mTORC2 inhibition on antitumor immune
microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of endothelial mTORC1 on recruiting LUSC
infiltrating T cells. In Aim 3, we propose (i) to increase tumor infiltrating lymphocytes by low-dose
RAD001 (selective inhibition of mTORC1 in endothelium) and (ii) improve T cell effector function by
siRictor nanoparticles (NP) (inhibition of mTORC2) in LUSC, either as a single agent, in combination
with checkpoint inhibitors, or three-way combination of low-dose RAD001 to increase TILs, followed
by siRictor-NPs and anti-PD1.
Success of this project will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of initiation and
progression to lung squamous cancer, especially how mTORC2 signaling in tumor cells influences
immune microenvironment. Study of immune microenvironment is particularly important for LUSC, as
immunotherapy becomes one main treatment for these patients. Further, success of this project will
have significant translational potential, as nanoparticle strategy is used in recent COVID-19 vaccines.
The proposed studies in this application will provide proof-of-concept for the impact of inhibiting
mTORC2 using a nanoparticle on tumor growth and antitumor immune responses."
10819199,"Project Summary
The success of lung transplantation is limited by high rates of primary graft dysfunction due to
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) characterized by robust inflammation, vascular permeability,
and alveolar damage. IRI is also a risk factor for late graft rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans), the
major cause of mortality beyond one year of transplant. TRPV4 is a transmembrane calcium
channel expressed in numerous cell types including vascular endothelial cells (ECs), alveolar
epithelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. TRPV4 activation can induce lung
endothelial/epithelial barrier dysfunction, a critical feature of IRI, and our data suggests that
TRPV4 activity in endothelial cells (ECs) is a significant mediator of lung IRI and that inhibition
of TRPV4 activity is significantly protective. We also show that TRPV4 activity may be affected
by ATP released by pannexin (Panx1) channels on ECs. Thus, our proposal will test the overall
hypothesis that endothelial TRPV4 channel signaling is a critical mediator of lung IRI by
inducing endothelial barrier disruption, vascular permeability and leukocyte infiltration. Aim 1 will
determine if TRPV4 activity on ECs mediates lung IRI leading to endothelial/epithelial barrier
dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and leukocyte infiltration. A potential role for TRPV4 in
alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils will also be evaluated during lung IRI.
Aim 2 will define mechanisms for a Panx1/TRPV4 axis in ECs that mediates lung IRI by testing
the hypothesis that TRPV4 is activated by ATP released by Panx1 channels after IR. We will
also determine if TRPV4 activity is induced by NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species
after IR. Aim 3 will utilize a murine orthotopic lung transplant model to decipher the role of
TRPV4 in donor versus recipient cells as well as in ECs after transplantation. In addition, a
clinically relevant, large animal porcine lung transplant model will be used to determine if
pharmacologic inhibition of Panx1 will prevent lung IRI after transplantation. There currently are
no preventative therapies for IRI, and our studies will provide novel insight into mechanisms of
lung IRI and will define TRPV4 channels as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of IRI
after lung transplantation."

This career development proposal resubmission is designed to provide Adrienne Johnson, PhD, the training
necessary to become an independent investigator in the fields of tobacco dependence, Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD), and dissemination and implementation (D&I) science. Dr. Johnson is trained as a
clinical psychologist and has substantial experience with patient-oriented research in comorbid medical and
psychiatric populations and expertise in smoking cessation within these populations. An expert mentoring team
will guide her in achieving four training objectives: (1) develop a comprehensive understanding of ADRD
etiological factors, prevention literature, and treatment approaches; (2) develop expertise in D&I science and its
application to intervention development and testing; (3) develop expertise in public health marketing and
motivational messaging; and (4) obtain training in larger scale clinical trial methodology. This training, consisting
of formal coursework, guided mentoring, an apprenticeship, and participation in national scientific conferences,
will allow Dr. Johnson to develop and test an intervention designed to help motivate older smokers quitting
smoking. Older adult smokers are at elevated risk for cognitive decline and ADRD development and, unless they
can successfully quit smoking, their prevalence will continue to rise. Unfortunately, older smokers are half as
likely to attempt to quit smoking and less likely to receive evidence-based smoking treatments (EBSTs)
compared to younger adults. Lower cessation efforts in older smokers may be a function of both clinician inaction
and dysfunctional beliefs/motivational deficits of older smokers. The proposed work will develop and test a readily
translatable Stage 1 motivational intervention for smoking cessation in older adults consisting of: (1) a novel
patient-informed motivational message promoting smoking cessation, and (2) clear access routes to EBSTs
within a healthcare setting. The proposed research will use three interrelated aims, occurring consecutively and
building off of findings from the previous aim, to achieve this objective. Aim 1 will identify the most promising
message content in terms of smoking cessation motivation and efficacy of and access to EBSTs in a healthcare
setting. Aim 2 will evaluate promising motivational intervention packages using survey methodology. Finally, Aim
3 will examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a novel comprehensive motivational intervention to
increase motivation to quit, quit attempts, and use of EBSTs for older adult smokers in a real-world clinical setting.
Dr. Johnson will apply a widely used model of health behavior change (Health Belief Model) to guide treatment
development and use a well validated D&I science framework (RE-AIM) to ensure she is building for translation.
Results will inform a future R01 application aimed at implementing and evaluating this intervention in a broader
context and examining the relation between smoking cessation and brain health."
10788365,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Hematopoiesis is a cellular developmental process that is controlled by a cell-intrinsic developmental program and cell-extrinsic factors from the microenvironment. The vascular niche present in the bone marrow and other hematopoietic organs provides the physical space and signals necessary for the proper regulation of this process. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) phylogenetic and functional diversity are restricted in patients who receive chemotherapy or are recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), leading to clonal hematopoiesis and cytopenias which are significant sources of morbidity and mortality in these patients. At present, very little is known about the role of the microenvironment in regulating HSC diversity. We hypothesized that mechanisms exist within the vascular niche that can be modulated to allow it to support a more phylogenetically and functionally diverse population of HSCs. We performed a genetic screen in barcoded GESTALT zebrafish and found that dysregulated expression of prkcda, the zebrafish PKC-delta homolog, increased the number of HSC clones contributing to hematopoiesis by more than 50%. Phenotypic analysis using single cell RNA-seq demonstrated the presence of a novel population of immature neutrophils and expansion of erythroid precursor cells. Single cell ATAC-seq analysis showed that chromatin accessibility at the promoter of the native prkcda locus is reduced specifically in vascular niche cell populations. These data led us to hypothesize the existence of a specific epigenetic program within the vascular niche that regulates expression of factors supporting hematopoiesis and thereby maintains the capacity of the niche to support HSC phylogenetic and functional diversity. In Aim 1, we will use Cut and Run analysis for specific epigenetic factors to characterize the vascular niche in human endothelial cell cultures. Multimodal single cell RNA-seq/ATAC-seq will be used in adult and embryonic zebrafish to identify niche cell populations and cis-acting DNA elements near genes important for supporting hematopoiesis. In Aim 2, a CRISPR screen will be used to identify specific transcription factor binding sites in human vascular niche cells lying proximal to and controlling transcription of key genes involved in niche function, including CXCL12, ANG1, and KITLG. A panel of zebrafish CRISPR mutants will be made to study the function of selected enhancer elements in vivo. Changes in niche function will be assayed in vitro by co-culture with HSPCs and in vivo by GESTALT barcoding and scRNA-seq. This work will provide new mechanistic understanding of how the capacity of the hematopoietic niche to support a diverse population of HSCs is regulated and may lead to new therapies that improve hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy or transplantation."
10774268,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although nearly 75% of global Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) cases will occur in lower- and
middle-income countries (LMICs) by 2050, little ADRD research includes data from these regions. This is a major
missed opportunity to identify individual-level and contextual influences on later-life cognitive function. Evidence
from high-income countries suggests ADRD is partly attributable to socioeconomic factors, such as education,
and cardiovascular factors, such as hypertension. Whether these same factors contribute to cognitive health
outcomes to a similar degree in LMICs with rapidly aging populations is unknown. Comparative research across
LMICs and high-income countries could help to unlock important drivers of ADRD and identify key differences
between countries that could be leveraged for prevention strategies to reduce the global ADRD burden. The
NIA-funded Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) was recently introduced into the US Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) and its International Partner Studies (IPS) as a comparable cross-national cognitive
assessment. Critically, no work has demonstrated that HCAP data from the various countries are in fact directly
comparable. Any observation of country-level differences may thus be an unknown mixture of actual differences
in the distribution of cognitive function and bias attributable to incommensurate measurement. Our overarching
goal is to estimate the contributions of key socioeconomic and cardiovascular ADRD risk factors to later-life
cognitive function between individuals and between countries in the US HRS and IPS in South Africa, Mexico,
India, and England. We have assembled HCAP and main HRS/IPS survey data on N=10,642 older adults from
these five countries. To accomplish our goal, we aim to: 1) statistically harmonize HCAP measures across
HRS/IPS countries using modern psychometrics to enable us to identify and address any differential item
functioning of HCAP measures across countries in order to facilitate valid cross-national comparisons; 2)
investigate and quantify the contributions of life course socioeconomic factors to variation in later-life cognitive
function between individuals and between countries; and, 3) investigate and quantify the contributions of
cardiovascular factors to variation in later-life cognitive function between individuals and between countries. Key
innovations are: 1) adaptation of sophisticated psychometric methods to harmonize HCAP data across
economically, socially, and culturally diverse country contexts; 2) inclusion of cross-national data to diversify and
expand representation of global populations in the ADRD evidence base; and, 3) use of multi-level models to
partition variance in later-life cognitive function to differences between individuals and differences between
countries. We will make our harmonized data available through the established Gateway to Global Aging Data
website. Our results will set the stage to identify intervention targets for high-risk individuals as well as whole
populations, with the ultimate goal of preventing and/or delaying the onset of ADRD from a global perspective."

Project Summary/Abstract
 The main function of the Metabolic Physiology and Energy Balance Core is to perform experimental services
to investigate alterations of glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism and body composition in rodent
models of obesity and insulin resistance.
 Increasingly, the biologic roles of gene products and pathways emerging from genomic, proteomic, metabolomic
and other discovery approaches are being queried by generating overexpression, gene knockout or knock-in of
altered genes in rodent models. Thus, there is a growing need for characterization of new mouse models created
by genetic or viral vector technologies. The Metabolic Physiology and Energy Balance Core is designed to meet the
needs for characterization of rodent models that have alterations in glucose homeostasis, insulin action, and/or body
composition and adiposity.
 The specific objectives of the Core are to carry out and interpret experiments for Core users aimed at investigating
glucose homeostasis and energy balance. In vivo studies in awake mice include continuous glucose monitoring,
measuring metabolic rates and energy balance by indirect calorimetry and body composition by EchoMRI and DEXA.
Studies in primary adipocytes or adipose explants include glucose transport, metabolism, and lipolysis with
assessment of insulin sensitivity. Services also include the differentiation of stromovascular cells into adipocytes
and assessment of glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. There is high demand for these services and we anticipate
high utilization.
 The Core is actively utilized by BADERC members and other investigators in the Boston area. It enables
investigators from other fields to carry out studies in the area of diabetes and metabolism that may not otherwise be
feasible. Since the inception of the Core, we have received an increasing number of requests for services from
investigators new to the field of metabolism, diabetes and obesity. The Core provides critical support for NIH grants
for both new and established investigators. In many cases, the Core provides the tools that enable experts in other
fields to apply their sophisticated techniques to metabolism research."

SUMMARY
The Boston Area Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center Pilot and Feasibility (BADERC P&F) program
has been effective both in recruiting and maintaining new talent in diabetes and endocrinology research, and in
fostering the most innovative pilot projects among established investigators with a new idea in diabetes research.
The subsequent funding history of P&F recipients from our first three funding cycles 2000-2014 has been
outstanding, despite the adverse funding climate, with nearly 75% of investigators achieving subsequent PI
status on diabetes-related NIH or foundation grants, and the overwhelming majority remaining in academic
diabetes-related research. The 73 pilot awards administered over the most recent 10 years of full, active funding,
alone (2009-2019) have spawned 87 NIH R-level project grants (or equivalent), estimated at more than
$93,000,000 in research funding. As such, the investment of ~$3.9M of P&F funds administered 2009-2019 has
realized a >2200% return on investment, exclusive of additional NIH career development awards, and additional
foundation and industry funding. Of these 73 awardees, an impressive 77% have obtained subsequent diabetes-
related research funding, and 91% remain in academic diabetes research. A further deliberate evolution of the
program has been towards funding an increasing number of cutting-edge clinical and translational research
projects, comprising over 1/3 of all funded applications in the 2014-2019 funding cycle. During our 2-year funding
gap, a testament to our commitment to this impactful program and to growing the next generation of leaders in
diabetes research, we have continued to support 7 of the most innovative P&F proposals with a second year of
funding, and funded 2 new BADERC-Nutrition Obesity Research Center of Harvard (NORC-H) jointly funded
proposals by judicious funding reallocation. Overall, the success of the BADERC P&F program reflects the ability
of the investigators who constitute the BADERC research base to recruit and train outstanding, ambitious,
creative and productive young investigators. The BADERC P&F program contributes demonstrably to the career
progress of these exciting young scientists and their entry into diabetes research. The program has the ultimate
goal of fostering the careers of those who will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and therapeutics for
all forms of diabetes. In the coming grant period, we will continue to fund and support the most promising P&F
projects, and introduce innovations that further the BADERC mission to recruit and retain the most talented and
diverse pool of investigators throughout the Boston area in basic, clinical, and translational diabetes-related

11011211,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Growth stunting is a global health problem that impacts ~149 million children under 5 years of age living
primarily in low-and-middle income-countries, particularly low-income countries. Mothers and infants are
particularly vulnerable to the impacts of malnutrition, including inadequacy of micronutrients which contributes to
stunted growth resulting in life-long morbidity and mortality, lower education achievement, and loss of human
capital. The goal of this proposal is to determine if a preconception maternal nutrition supplement can alter
targeted and epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAme) in infants born in regions prone to high rates of growth
stunting. DNAme is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene transcription, and thus, phenotypical
differences and risk for noncommunicable diseases. Specifically, we will test if maternal consumption of a small
quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement (sqLNS) prior to conception alters infant DNAme at birth and beyond,
and if these epigenetic changes are associated with growth during the first two years of life. We will examine
DNAme of specific genomic regions called human metastable epialleles (MEs); MEs are systemic epigenetic
marks that can be detected at birth and known to be altered by maternal nutritional status at conception in
low resource settings. In addition, several epigenetic clocks (Horvath, PhenoAge, Hannum) have been
developed that estimate: 1) chronological age with ≥ 96% accuracy; 2) phenotypic age; and 3) epigenetic age
acceleration (EAA). Estimates of epigenetic age provide indications of life and health span. Obesity,
cardiovascular disease, cancers, and type 2 diabetes mellitus have been shown to be strongly associated with
increased EAA, potentially reducing life and health span. However, there are a paucity of studies addressing
MEs and EAA in the context of growth stunting, low resource settings, and in response to a preconception
maternal nutritional intervention. This proposal leverages a completed randomized controlled trial
(NCT01883193, Women First, WF) in mother-infant dyads from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
Guatemala, India, and Pakistan. The WF RCT was comprised of three treatment arms: Arm 1 = women
consumed sqLNS ≥ 3 months prior to conception until delivery; Arm 2 = women consumed the same sqLNS
commencing at 12 weeks gestion until delivery; and Arm 3 = no sqLNS was consumed. We propose the following
aims to advance our understanding of maternal nutrition and offspring health and growth via DNAme changes:
Aim 1: Test if timing of sqLNS alters DNAme of specific genomic regions called human metastable epialleles
(MEs) at birth (placenta N = 463) and 3 months postnatally (buccal N = 391) using EPIC 850K arrays.
Aim 2: Determine maternal and infant factors that impact infant epigenetic and gestational age acceleration
(GAA, placenta N =463).
Aim 3: Targeted DNAme profiles (MEs & EAA) and epigenome-wide DNAme will be predictive of neonatal
anthropometry and growth in the first 2 years of life (placenta N = 463)."
10891345,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nearly 1 in 3 American adults exceed the recommended limit for alcohol consumption, increasing their risk of
health problems including hypertensive heart disease, injuries, and several types of cancer. Most adults are
not aware of the harms of alcohol consumption. Evidence-based warnings on alcohol containers that are
displayed prominently on the front of the package, include pictorial elements such as icons, and rotate their
content over time could inform consumers and discourage unhealthy alcohol consumption. The overarching
objective of this proposal is to evaluate the impact of evidence-based alcohol warnings on alcohol
consumption. In Aim 1, we will use existing research and expert review to optimize warning statements
describing the health harms of alcohol consumption. We will then test an array of evidence-based warnings in
a randomized experiment with a nationally representative sample of 910 adult regular alcohol consumers. The
main product of Aim 1 will be the selection of 4 evidence-based warnings that participants endorse as effective
for use in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the impact of these evidence-based alcohol warnings on alcohol
consumption in a longitudinal RCT. We will recruit 786 adult regular alcohol consumers. Participants will be
randomly assigned to a warnings arm or a control arm. In a 4-week study, participants in the warnings arm will
receive the 4 unique evidence-based warnings affixed to their alcohol containers, allocated in random order. In
the control arm, no new labels will be applied. We will assess whether the evidence-based alcohol warnings
reduce number of drinks consumed (measured using daily diaries) and examine whether this effect varies by
baseline alcohol use, gender, age, and education. We will also evaluate how warnings influence potential
psychological mediators (measured in weekly surveys). The final product of Aim 2 will be an estimate of the
impact of evidence-based alcohol warnings on alcohol consumption. In Aim 3, we will validate a model of how
alcohol warnings influence alcohol consumption. We will conduct in-depth interviews with participants in the
warnings arm of Aim 2’s RCT to elicit insights about the mechanisms through which the trial warnings
influenced their behavior. Then, we will apply mediation analyses to the longitudinal daily diary and survey data
collected in Aim 2’s RCT to identify mediators of the impact of the trial warnings on alcohol consumption. The
final product of Aim 3 will be a model of how evidence-based alcohol warnings influence alcohol consumption.
This research is responsive to NOT-AA-21-028 by conducting causal analyses of an alcohol-reduction
policy and advancing methods by implementing an innovative RCT with naturalistic exposure to warnings.
Our findings will create an evidence base to inform development of effective alcohol warnings as well as other
communication campaigns. Ultimately, new evidence-based alcohol warnings could reduce unhealthy alcohol
consumption and address rising rates of alcohol-attributable disease and death in the US and globally."
10851018,"Valvular heart disease represents a major public health problem worldwide. The incidence of valvular heart
disease increases with age, and it is estimated that about 15% of the population above the age of 75 years
suffer from some form of significant valvular disorder. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most frequent form of
valvular heart diseases, where it is estimated that moderate and severe MR occurs at a frequency of 1.7% as
adjusted to the US adult population, and up to 5% of the population in Europe have significant mitral valve
disease. The natural history of chronic MR is characterized by a compensated hemodynamic state in its early
phases, followed by a gradual progressive left ventricular (LV) remodeling and eccentric hypertrophy resulting
in heart failure. MR patients with depressed systolic function can present a difficult management dilemma;
corrective valve surgery is not recommended, and medical therapy is ineffective in preventing LV dysfunction.
It should perhaps be not surprising that medical therapy for MR has repeatedly failed, since very little is known
about the molecular mechanisms of myocardial dysfunction associated with primary severe MR, perhaps
owing to the paucity of research tools.
One of the major limitations in understanding the molecular mechanisms of myocardial response to severe MR
lies in the lack of mouse models. Although several elegant large animal studies, and even a rat MR model
have been published, the mechanism of eccentric hypertrophy and myocardial dysfunction secondary to
severe MR is not known. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanistic basis of LV
systolic dysfunction secondary to severe MR that can guide the development of new therapeutic strategies. In
the current proposal, we developed the first mouse model of MR. Valvular damage was achieved by severing
the MV leaflets and chords using iridectomy scissors, and severe MR was confirmed by echocardiography. We
found that this model recapitulates the effect of severe MR on the human myocardium with eccentric
hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, and activation of canonical hypertrophy pathways. In addition, we found
evidence of activation of directional cell growth as a possible mechanism of longitudinal cardiomyocyte growth
in response to MR. Therefore, we hypothesize that MR-induced eccentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is
mediated by activation of canonical hypertrophy pathways in conjunction with directional cell growth. There are
three aims: Determine the role of oxidative DNA damage in regulating eccentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in
response to severe MR. To determine the role of Crb2 in regulation of cardiomyocyte shape during postnatal
development and in response to hypertrophic stimuli. Finally, we aim to identify the spatial pattern of
sarcomeric mRNA translation during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to MR."
10799595,"Understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is complicated due to the existence of
dysregulations at different biological scales, ranging from genetic mutations to structural and functional brain
alterations. Most models for studying AD are primarily focused on unimodal analysis, but there is a lack of
systematic approaches that can integrate data across multiple scales to study the longitudinal disease
progression. For example, the molecular mechanisms of brain atrophy related to progression to AD is not well
understood. Although the promise of integrative analysis across multiple scales is increasingly recognized,
there has been limited progress in developing interpretable and systematic approaches due the fact that the
neuroimaging and -omics features have unique patterns of dependence and it is not immediately clear how to
combine these two modalities for modeling progression to AD. Another limitation is that most of the existing
methods have focused on delineating biological causes for differences between disease specific phenotypes
that does not account for heterogeneity and does not treat the disorder as a continuum, which is recommended
as per current NIA guidelines. To address these critical challenges, we develop a suite of statistical methods
for modeling disease progression in AD involving longitudinal neuroimaging (MRI) scans and cognitive scores,
combined with baseline -omics features and demographic and clinical data. Our integrative longitudinal
analysis addresses critical gaps in literature and generates more robust results that are generalizable to more
inclusive populations and yields more power in detecting true signals. We use spatially distributed voxel-wise
brain surface features derived from MRI scans that provides high resolution interpretations about the changes
in brain shape associated with disease progression. We develop predictive models which treats AD as a
continuum while integrating data across disease stages and multiple visits in a systematic manner that is able
to account for heterogeneity between and within disease stages and provides interpretable insights into
longitudinal neuroimaging and baseline -omics features that drive cognition. Our methods can be used for
developing individualized prediction trajectories for disease progression, identify latent states that are
prognostic for specific disease stages, and predict cognition at future visits that can be directly used for early
detection of high-risk individuals. We will develop and train our models using longitudinal ADNI data involving
several thousand individuals and validate our findings on an independent longitudinal B-SHARP dataset. The
statistical tools and algorithms developed will be made widely available to the broader research community. To
our knowledge, our project is one of the first to develop an integrative and interpretable statistical framework
for studying the trajectory of disease progression in AD using longitudinal and heterogeneous biomarker data
from multiple scales, which provides valuable computational tools for early detection in AD that is of
tremendous clinical importance in delivering patent centric outcomes in precision medicine."

networking and fundraising—which are critical to her success as an independent investigator in the field of
Molecular Imaging. The proposed work will lead to the preparation of a R01 grant proposal. Research Plan: A
recognized mechanism of cancer to evade immunological attack is glutamine transport to deactivate (via PD-
L1) and to deprive energy (independent of PD-L1) from infiltrating immune cells. The central hypothesis is that
quantitative imaging of immune evasion mechanisms using CEST MRI can ultimately be used to help predict
patient response to immunotherapy. Dr. Thomas proposes to develop CEST MRI agents and detection
methods that can quantify glutamine transport and PD-L1 expression simultaneously. She will also develop
post-processing methods to quantify these agents. To validate their potential as complementary imaging
biomarkers of cancer immune evasion, she will evaluate their uptake in prostate cancer cell lines (in vitro;
cancerous: PC3, LNCaP, DU-145; noncancerous: RWPE-1 and RWPE-2) and in a prostate tumor model (in
vivo) and compare their uptake to conventional immune suppression (PD-L1 histology, flow cytometry,
cytokines) and immune evasion (surface marker expression, tumor infiltration of leukocytes) metrics. Aim 1:
Develop methods to visualize and quantify PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer. Aim 2: Develop methods to
visualize and quantify glutamine transport in prostate cancer. Aim 3: Validate the methods by evaluating both
PD-L1 expression and glutamine transport simultaneously in prostate cancer progression models."
10812370,"Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder affecting human movements. PD is not
just a motor disease. It also results in impaired multi-sensory processing that is critical for encoding self-
orientation and self-motion. Ultimately, this leads to abnormal spatial navigation, lateral drifts while walking
(veering), postural instability and falls in about 70% of patients. Conventional pharmacotherapy or deep brain
stimulation (DBS) for PD are variably effective in treating these debilitating symptoms. DBS improves balance
dysfunction in some patients, while in some it does not affect balance or even makes it worse. Defining consistent
therapy requires a proper understanding of the mechanisms of navigational impairments in PD, and to know how
DBS modulates the balance function. A singular vision of our research program is: 1) To reveal the
physiological underpinnings of how DBS modulates the process by which multisensory integrated systems
govern perception of one’s own motion critical for spatial navigation, gait and balance in PD. 2) To be able to
consistently treat navigational impairments such as veering in PD patients with subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS
while preserving its other benefits of treating tremor and increased muscle tone, and reducing pharmacotherapy
burden with bothersome side effects. With this goal the current Merit Review application focuses on the vestibular
system – the critical system for the perception of one’s own linear motion, i.e. vestibular heading perception –
the task that is has to be accurate for the proper control of balance, navigation, and averting falls. We
hypothesize that effects of STN DBS on vestibular heading perception and veering are dependent upon the
specific location of the active electrode contact within the STN and modulation of the cerebello-thalamic pathway
that is known to carry the vestibular signal and is in physical vicinity of the STN. In order to test this hypothesis
we will objectively measure one’s ability to perceive direction of linear motion (i.e., vestibular heading perception),
lateral drifts while walking (i.e., veering) that is common in PD, and then we will compare these objective
measures among three independent conditions – dorsal STN DBS, ventral STN DBS, and DBS off. The Aim 1
will examine the effects of the location of volume of tissue activation within the STN on the change in vestibular
heading perception and veering in human PD patients. We will collate physical location of the volume of tissue
activation from all patients when the change in vestibular heading perception and veering was found. These
locations, generating the probabilistic stimulation atlas, will provide insights about areas of STN that could
influence balance function in PD. The Aim 2 will examine the recruitment metrics of the axonal pathways
modulated by the STN DBS that correlates with change in vestibular heading perception and veering in PD
patients. It will directly examine the role of involvement of cerebello-thalamic pathway that is known to transmit
vestibular perception information and is in vicinity of the STN. In summary, by taking a top-down approach and
leveraging a multidisciplinary team of investigators studying human PD patients with STN DBS, neuroimaging,
and computational modeling; we will unravel mechanisms through which STN DBS modulates the vestibular
heading perception in PD. Finally we will apply this mechanistic understanding to design consistent and effective
therapeutic strategies utilizing DBS to prevent falls in PD."
10806967,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Venous thrombosis (VT) and its major complication, pulmonary embolism (PE), are often grouped together and
called venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is a major health problem that affect nearly 600,000 people each
year. The historical drivers of VTE are blood stasis, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulation (Virchow’s
triad). It is now recognized that platelets and neutrophils have a critical initiating role. The molecular mechanisms
are only being uncovered. Given that hypercoagulation is a risk factor and thrombin activated protease activated
receptor 4 (PAR4) promotes procoagulant platelets, phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure and subsequent
thrombin generation, we propose that PAR4 is an important contributor to VTE. The long-term goals of this
research program are to uncover the mechanisms of PAR4 activation at the molecular level and test these
mechanism in vivo to inform disease processes and potential drug development. The scientific premise of this
proposal is based our preliminary data showing that extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) of PAR4 coordinates with the
ligand binding site (LBS) during PAR4 activation. Further, mutations in either ECL3 or the LBS disrupt PAR4
signaling to the same degree. This points to an essential role for ECL3 in PAR4 activation. The overall objective
of this proposal is to 1) to determine how PAR4 contributes to the initiation and propagation of venous thrombosis
using mouse models, 2) conduct proof-of-concept studies using PAR4 antagonist to treat VT, 3) to translate our
recent structural insights on the PAR4 activation mechanism to PAR4 function in vivo. We will do this by taking
advantage a PAR4 variant in human platelets and a new mouse model. Our overall hypothesis is that the
sustained signaling from PAR4 on platelets is a driver of VTE and reduced PAR4 signaling from hypo-reactive
variants or pharmacological inhibitors will lead to protection from VTE. Our innovative approach will take
advantage of a new mouse model that recreates a polymorphism in ECL3 and will allow us to determine the
mechanism of how this polymorphism contributes to platelet function and thrombosis. The completion of the
proposed studies will accomplish two major advances. 1) we will be the first to specifically examine the role of
PAR4 in venous thrombosis. 2) we will continue to push our basic understanding of PAR activation mechanisms
by testing the observations from our structural studies in vivo to determine how these mechanisms operate in
physiological and pathophysiological contexts."
10806144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overview. Centrioles, and the centrosomes they scaffold, organize the cell, and provide the foundation for
development and tissue homeostasis. To do this, centrioles exert control over the cell's microtubule (MT)
network, providing a micron-scale framework for intracellular trafficking, intracellular and extracellular signaling,
genome segregation, cell morphology, and cell mobility. To perform these roles, centrioles change through the
cell cycle via the processes of new centriole assembly and modulations to scaffolding functions. During a
normal cell cycle, centrioles nucleate the sensory and signaling compartment of cilia in G0/G1, duplicate
coincident with the genome during S-phase, and organize the mitotic spindle during mitosis. In cancer and
Trisomy 21 (the cause of Down syndrome), these mechanisms are disrupted. In specialized multiciliated cell
types, centrioles nucleate motile cilia which generate fluid flows necessary for reproduction, development, and
respiratory airway function. How centrioles are controlled, function and resist mechanical forces remain poorly
understood.
Goals for five years. We aim to dissect poorly understood mechanisms in how centrioles duplicate, how MT-
based intracellular trafficking and cilia are controlled by centrosome protein dosage, and how centrioles
provide the foundation for mechanical forces from motile cilia. We will investigate novel controls of centriole
duplication either through spatial distributions of regulatory factors or through mRNA metabolism that
generates functionally different proteins from the same gene. We will determine how imbalances in centriole
number and centriole protein dosage, as observed in cancer and Trisomy 21, impact cytoplasmic MTs and
intracellular trafficking for primary cilia formation and signaling. Finally, we will illuminate how centrioles act as
force capacitors for motile cilia through connections to neighboring centrioles and the cell cortex and ask if they
transmit forces back to cilia. These projects will establish the fundamental mechanics of centrioles as they
assemble primary cilia for signaling and motile cilia for hydrodynamic flow.
Vision for program. Discoveries in the fundamentals of centriole and centrosome biology, focusing on MT-
dependent trafficking and mechanical force resistance, will have broad implications for understanding aspects
of development, mechanobiology, and disease. Changes in RNA metabolism have a critical role in
development, and by establishing mRNA processing events that affect centrioles and the MT network we
anticipate identifying targets important for specialized cell types that utilize their MT networks in very different
ways. Furthermore, our current studies in Trisomy 21 are pointing toward exciting future directions for
understanding the cellular basis of cardiac, immune, and secretory cell systems directly impacted in Down
syndrome."

Crohn’s disease (CD) represents a significant public health challenge with more than 1 million individuals
affected by this condition in the US. To date, a complete cure of CD is not available. CD has a multifactorial
etiology, characterized by a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors, particularly an
inappropriate inflammatory response to commensal microbes in genetically affected individuals.
Fungal infection
represents one of the most serious health hazards, especially for immuno-compromised patients.
C
andidiasis
has dramatically increased worldwide, especially in neutropenic patients or patients with altered gut microbiome
due to increased antibiotic use. Recent studies performed by our group have demonstrated that the abundance
C. tropicalis is significantly higher in patients with CD compared to their non-diseased first-degree relatives. C.
tropicalis and C. albicans have been recognized as the most common pathogenic fungi and are part of the human
commensal flora. C. tropicalis and C. albicans are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the
role of Candida infections in intestinal inflammation in patients with CD has not been fully elucidated. Therefore,
there is a need for mechanistic studies aimed at delineating the molecular mechanisms by which Candida
infection may result in exacerbation of CD. Studies proposed herein take advantage of a unique resource, a
spontaneous murine model of CD-like ileitis (SAMP1/YitFc or SAMP), to decipher the mechanistic role of
candidiasis in experimental ileitis. Strong preliminary data from our group have demonstrated that C57BL/6 (B6)
mice infected with C. tropicalis are significantly more susceptible to develop dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-
induced colitis compared to uninfected littermates, with increased gene expression of key Th1 response-
associated genes, such as Tnf and Ifn, and decreased expression of Th2 response-associated genes, such
as Il4 and Il13. 16S rRNA analysis of fecal samples from infected and uninfected mice have shown that C.
tropicalis significantly altered the microbiome population of B6 mice, with increased abundance of mucin
degrading bacteria, such as Akkermansia (A.) muciniphila and Ruminococcus (R.) gnavus.
Based on its
biological effects, we hypothesized that Candida infection may alter the gut microbiome community resulting in
dysbiosis that, in turn, increases the susceptibility of the host to develop IBD, or triggers flare in CD patients. The
goals of this proposal are: (1) demonstrate that Candida infections contribute to worsen experimental intestinal
inflammation; and (2) identify the specific microbes and mechanisms responsible for the increased intestinal
inflammation in B6 and SAMP mice. Understanding the mechanisms by which candidiasis affects the gut
microbiome is essential to maintain remission in CD patients and the design of novel antimicrobial therapies with
increased efficacy and decreased side-effects."
10791844,"Obesity and overweight affect more than one third of the world population, and are significant risk factors for a
number of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Common obesity is usually
accompanied by elevated circulating levels of leptin, the primary adipostatic factor in mammals. Methods
augmenting leptin sensitivity may represent safe and effective means of treating obesity. This proposal
presents compelling new preliminary data showing that peripheral administration of a specific histone
deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor (Tubastatin A) to diet-induced obese mice suppresses food intake and
reduces obesity, in an HDAC6-dependent manner, with up to 50 percent decrease in fat mass. These
improvements are accompanied by significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, and improved systemic glucose
homeostasis. Tubastatin does not induce weight loss in leptin receptor mutant db/db mice, or lean wild type
mice, but increases the sensitivity of animals to exogenous leptin administration. Tubastatin-induced metabolic
improvements are independent of central HDAC6 activity, and in large part depends on adipose tissue HDAC6
expression. The current application is centered on the hypothesis that peripheral HDAC6 inhibition confers
central leptin sensitization, and proposes to identify the anatomical (Aim 1) and molecular (Aim 2) mechanisms
of HDAC6 inhibition-mediated amelioration of obesity and diabetes using a combination of genetic,
pharmacological and biochemical approaches. Aim 3 will explore the central mediators of leptin sensitization,
and how blood brain barrier permeability is potentially altered by HDAC6 inhibitors. It will further study the role
of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 as a potentially novel regulator or leptin receptor signaling. This
proposal presents HDAC6 as a novel regulator of energy homeostasis and as a potential target for
development of novel therapeutic approaches against obesity. More generally, this work will establish a
fundamental platform for basic and clinical research for the treatment of obesity and eating disorders."
10800731,"Project Summary / Abstract
Even though most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will not die of the disease, prostate cancer is still the
second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. While screening for prostate cancer
reduces death from disease, this comes at the price of both unnecessary biopsies that reveal no evidence of
cancer and treatment of otherwise indolent cancer resulting in unnecessary adverse events. Therefore, there
is an unmet need for improved screening tools for prostate cancer. To address this need, we have previously
developed a four-kallikrein biomarker panel that is now commercially available as a reflex test for use after an
initial PSA screening; found that the four kallikrein model improves the prediction, prior to any diagnosis of
prostate cancer, of which men may die of prostate cancer; and identified SNPs associated with survival time
after diagnosis, independent of known prognostic factors. Combining these SNPs and the four kallikrein panel
improves our ability to identify men at risk of dying from prostate cancer even further. Based on these findings,
we propose here a germline genomic approach to identify men at risk of dying from prostate cancer. By
leveraging recent computational advances in genomic analysis, we will take a gene-centered approach to
identify genes for which genetically controlled transcriptional alterations and/or functional coding mutations
influence survival time in prostate cancer. Using these genes, along with known genetic risk factors for prostate
cancer and the four kallikrein panel, we will build and test models designed to identify men at risk for clinically
significant prostate cancer in order to better stratify men in the screening context prior to biopsy. Specifically,
we will: 1) Identify genes for which genetically controlled expression level changes and/or rare coding variants
alter the risk of dying from prostate cancer; 2) Determine at what stage(s) of disease progression these genetic
changes operate; and 3) Improve our 4-kallikrein biomarker predictor of lethal prostate cancer through
incorporation of genetic data. This will be achieved by conducting both a transcriptome-wide association study
(TWAS) with prostate specific models and a whole exome sequencing study in a set of well-annotated cohorts
with long follow-up time after prostate cancer diagnosis. Successful completion of these aims will enable
better risk stratification of men prior to prostate cancer diagnosis. We envision these findings being useful in
the screening context, enabling more precise identification of men at high risk of dying from prostate cancer in
the next two decades, thereby reducing death from prostate cancer due to the benefits of early detection while
avoiding unnecessary biopsies and unneeded treatment of otherwise indolent cancers. Furthermore, these
findings will be useful in understanding the biology of lethal prostate cancer as we anticipate these findings will
pinpoint new genes and pathways that play important roles in prostate cancer progression."

The devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have reverberated through every aspect of our civilization.
While SARS-CoV-2, the viral etiology of COVID-19, seems to spare infants in terms of actual infection, it is
currently unknown whether maternal infection during pregnancy will have long-term effects on children born
during the pandemic. A variety of prenatal insults, including infections and stress, are well-known to lead to
increased risk of affective disorders in both mother and child. With its disproportionate reach into already
disadvantaged minority communities, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dyad is currently unknown
and potentially of unprecedented magnitude with enduring consequences for women's mental health and
children's developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). The COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcome
(COMBO) initiative, a large multidisciplinary collaborative, was established at Columbia University Irving
Medical Center to follow SARS-CoV-2 exposed laboring mothers and their newborns and compare their long-
term health outcomes to case-matched dyads without prenatal exposure. This proposal will follow a subset of
the larger COMBO cohort to study socioemotional circuits (fronto-limbic) and behavior (caregiving and
bonding) in 100 mother-child dyads from prepartum to 18 months postpartum. The team assembled to carry
out this study consists of two provider scientists (Dumitriu, pediatrician and neuroscientist, & Monk, clinical
psychologist embedded in Ob/Gyn) and neuroscientist/pediatric neuroimager (Marsh). Using an innovative
dyadic approach, olfaction testing, multimodal MRI, wearable in-home physiological recordings, observational
mother and child assessments (free play, routine care, Harvard Reactivity and Still Face paradigms), this
proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects (1) mother and (2)
child brain and behavior, and (3) demonstrate that the socioemotional health of each member of the mother-
child dyad is intrinsically related to that of the other. Detecting COVID-19-related early neurobehavioral effects
on mothers and the next generation will provide insights into intervention strategies and contribute significantly
to DOHaD and stress science."

In this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award for Outstanding Early-Stage Postdoctoral Researchers
application, Dr. Hamlet Gasoyan outlines a detailed proposal to enhance his research training in cancer
disparities research in tandem with examining the modifiable determinants of treatment-related disparities in
patients with multiple myeloma (MM). A primary goal of Dr. Gasoyan is to become an independent and
productive investigator in the field of cancer health disparities, with a research focus on obesity-related
cancers. His short-term training objectives for the K99 Mentored Training are to (1) advance his
knowledge and skills in cancer disparities research; (2) advance his skills in analyzing EHR-generated
clinical and large administrative data for health services research; and (3) gain experience and skills
required to successfully lead a research lab and engage with medical practitioners, community members,
and health care policymakers.
MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the US with an estimated 34,920 incident cases
and 12,410 lethal outcomes to occur in 2021. Black individuals have a dramatically higher incidence of MM, as
well as a higher rate of MM mortality, compared with White individuals, likely due to several, complex risk
factors, such as genetics and differences in exposure to established MM risk factors, such as obesity.
Treatment of MM is costly, with one of the highest lifetime net costs among all cancer sites. While novel
treatment agents and regimens are available, newly diagnosed Black patients are less likely to undergo stem
cell transplantation, use prescription oral medication lenalidomide, or be treated with triplet (3-drug) regimens,
such as bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, than their White peers. Furthermore, Black patients
receive these novel therapies later compared to their White peers. Given the high cost of treatment, health
insurance coverage likely has an important role in racial disparities of accessing novel therapies for MM.
Nevertheless, the role of uninsurance or underinsurance in MM care patterns was not well studied.
Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic has made presenting for in-person medical care even more
challenging, particularly for individuals from underserved communities, no study to date investigated the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on disparities in MM care patterns.
The aims of the proposed research plan are to (1) examine whether
determinants
patients' insurance coverage and social
of health can explain the racial disparities in MM treatment patterns, (2) assess the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on MM care patterns, and (3) assess whether payer type and cost-sharing arrangements
are associated with disparities in the utilization of induction therapy for MM with triplet regimens as well as
maintenance therapy with prescription oral medications, such as lenalidomide."

Migraine affects an estimated 12-15% of the world population. Chronic migraine, which completely disrupts the
lives of sufferers, affects close to 3% and accounts for the vast majority of the disability and cost of the disorder.
It also contributes to the epidemic of opioid overuse that has been a major impediment to pain care in the past
20 years. One of the highest priorities in migraine research is to understand the progression from episodic to
chronic migraine, so it can be prevented. Current clinical criteria are useful for diagnosing episodic and chronic
migraine, but they have not necessarily been predictive of progression, and thus are not helpful in identifying
subjects at risk.This proposal aims to discover and validate biomarkers of migraine progression.
 Our key hypothesis is that the sensory amplifications that characterize migraine – photophobia, phonophobia,
allodynia, and others – constitute psychophysical and physiological biomarkers, and that they will better predict
migraine progression than the current clinically-based gold standard. Our group has shown that different
individual sensory amplifications scale with disease severity; our preliminary data shows that their sensitivity is
amplified when they are combined. We also propose that though psychophysical/physiological biomarkers are
conceptually novel, they are also practical in the clinical setting and indeed consistent with routine neurological
evaluation. Our group’s expertise spans the full range of sensory amplifications in migraine and importantly
incorporates expertise in developing and validating practical instruments for migraine research and clinical use.
 The R61 Phase (3 years; 300 high frequency episodic migraineurs followed longitudinally; Aims 1 and 2) will
deploy a multimodal, multilevel assessment of sensory amplifications with the goal of identifying the most
sensitive measures for prognostication. Aim 1 will provide performance parameters of sensory amplifications as
biomarkers of migraine progression. Aim 2 will develop a tool (predictive model) for prognosticating disease
progression. This predictive model will explicitly consider sex, aura, and medication use/overuse, as these
variables are also well-known to contribute to both sensory amplifications and chronification. Milestones for
transition from R61 to R33 will include successful development of a refined battery of sensory tests for formal
validation as biomarkers in the R33 Phase. If milestones are met, the R33 Phase (2 years; 100 subjects each in
US and Brazil; Aim 3) will validate the refined battery, with the goal of providing optimized tools for use in clinical
trials. Thus, Aim 3 will confirm (or refute) the prognostic predictive utility of the model identified in the R61 Phase
in two different populations.
 If successful, this work will deliver the first ever validated prognostic tools to be used in migraine. Their purpose
will be to help prevent the progression of episodic to chronic migraine, reduce the attendant opioid overuse that
this progression often brings, and ultimately mitigate the overwhelming burden of chronic migraine on patients
and society."
10771946,"Abstract: The metabolic response to meals high in fat and cholesterol requires the coordination of a complex
system of cellular processes. Disruption of these cellular processes can lead to metabolic diseases, such as
diabetes, heart disease, and hepatic steatosis. Previous experiments have shown that high-fat diets increase
transcription of genes and gene pathways that mediate lipid metabolism, storage, and secretion. One of the
most highly upregulated genes within the digestive organs (liver and small intestine), in response to dietary
triglycerides (TG), is apolipoprotein A4 (apoa4). The function of ApoA4 protein is currently unknown, but it has
been implicated in the regulation of lipoprotein particle synthesis and secretion, as well as satiety, inflammation,
and insulin responsivity. Since TG-induced apoa4 gene expression has not been observed in cultured cells and
only observed in whole animal models, I will use the zebrafish system to examine the spatial and temporal
expression of lipid metabolic genes in response to dietary TG. The digestive system of zebrafish is functionally
and developmentally similar to mammalian systems, with high genetic conservation in essential metabolic
components. Because larval zebrafish are optically clear and genetically tractable, I have engineered a cell-
tracing, fluorescent reporter in the endogenous apoa4 locus, which will allow me to visualize the dietary TG
response in live zebrafish larvae. I plan to characterize the timing and location of apoa4 expression to determine
whether expression of lipid metabolic genes is a cell-autonomous response to direct, cellular uptake of TGs; or
if it is driven by short- and/or long-distance intercellular signaling.
 The proposed apoa4 reporter will also allow me to screen for the effect of specific pathway genes and
transcription factors (TFs) on the TG-induced transcriptional response of intestinal enterocytes that results in
apoa4 expression. I plan to use my apoa4 reporter as a measure of dietary TG absorption to help delineate the
cellular mechanisms that underlie the dietary TG metabolic gene response. Although, several TFs implicated in
regulating apoa4 have been identified in the liver, TFs responsible for regulating apoa4 in enterocytes have not
been characterized. We know that lipoprotein synthesis and secretion in digestive organs is largely dependent
on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity, but the mechanisms underlying the dependence on
MTP for apoa4 gene expression in different digestive organs is unknown. To determine the regulatory
mechanisms underlying MTP-dependence in the intestine, I plan to use the apoa4 transgenic reporter to assay
genes that potentially mediate the relationships between dietary TG absorption, MTP activity, and apoa4
expression. The proposed research will identify regulatory relationships between the metabolic gene response
to dietary TGs, and lipoprotein production and secretion. Additionally, the proposed apoa4 optical reporter will
be a valuable tool for rapid measurement of triglyceride absorption in response to changes in nutritional,
behavioral, microbial, pharmacological, and environmental conditions in future studies."

This grant proposes both an innovative contrast agent and X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging method
for monitoring implantable biomaterials, in vivo. Tissue engineered scaffolds (TES) are a regenerative medicine
paradigm that create 3D environments to induce tissue formation in a variety of tissues, including skin, bone,
connective tissue and nerves. Key to TES research and development is the ability to measure true in vivo
biodegradation rates, and to assess internal microstructure post-implantation. Serial imaging and data analysis
can accomplish this in ways that are easier and more reliable than histology. Further, this new contrast agent
and imaging method are directly translatable for clinical monitoring of TES structural integrity and location post-
implantation in patients.
CT is a clinically important radiological technique, affording high resolution scans with safe levels of radiation,
with imaging systems in nearly every hospital and radiology department, and preclinical microCT research
systems common throughout academia and industry. We have pioneered strategies for using microCT to
visualize TES and measure biodegradation in vivo following implantation into mice. Our early studies
accomplished this by doping TES with radiopaque gadolinium and bismuth nanoparticles, however, gadolinium
and bismuth exhibit compromising toxicity, obviating their clinical translation and continued development.
Tantalum oxide (TaOx) has emerged as a more biocompatible alternative, with enhanced CT properties, and so,
in this grant, we propose to fully investigate TaOx nanoparticles for enabling in vivo serial imaging of biomaterials
and TES. We have extensive preliminary data on the facile incorporation of TaOx nanoparticles into polymer
TES for nerve regeneration, with a robust microCT imaging and analysis protocol.
In Aim 1 we will fabricate and characterize a collection of polymer TES with varying TaOx content and
degradation rates, with well characterized properties. A battery of in vitro assessments will be performed with
the goal of maximizing TaOx content while minimally impacting physical properties or causing adverse toxicity.
In Aim 2 we will demonstrate the usefulness of microCT of TaOx-embedded biodegradable TES by measuring
the true in vivo biodegradation of TaOx-embedded polymer TES implanted in varying physiological milieu,
determining 1) the effect of implantation site physiological milieu on TES biodegradation rate, and 2) how well in
vitro degradation studies predict in vivo biodegradation and TES integrity. In Aim 3 we will determine the in vivo
impact of TaOx by evaluating the in vivo performance of TaOx-embedded biodegradable TES for promoting
functional nerve regrowth in peripheral nerve injury, measuring in vivo biodegradation and evaluating potential
toxicity. Successful demonstration of functional nerve regrowth with TaOx-embedded PLGA TES will rationalize
translational studies towards in vivo CT evaluation of TaOx-embedded TES in humans."
10805367,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is among the most common fatal genetic diseases in the U.S. and involves progressive lung
function loss and structural remodeling, leading to lung transplant or death. Though life expectancy in CF patients
has increased due to improved treatments, pathological changes still occur within the first year of life. It has been
difficult to detect these early changes, because conventional measures of lung function such as spirometry (e.g.,
forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1) are lagging indicators and insensitive to early disease. In contrast,
ultra-short echo-time (UTE) and hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe MRI can detect pathology years before FEV1. Addi-
tionally, proteomic biomarkers from high-precisions mass spectrometry (MS), when coupled with modeling based
on Functional Data (FD) analysis, accurately forecast CF lung disease progression. However, these biomarkers
have only been validated in patients with established disease. The long-term goal of this research is to validate
proteomic markers that detect and predict lung function decline and structural remodeling in early lung disease.
The objective of this application is to use state-of-the-art HP 129Xe and UTE MRI to validate proteomic markers
in early CF. This will be accomplished using blood serum and clinically obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
fluid from CF patients with known lung pathology. Our central hypothesis is that image-guided proteomics can
forecast pathophysiology before spirometric changes are observed. Our rationale is that, while 129Xe and UTE
MRI are currently limited to specialized centers, MS proteomics can be performed on readily obtained clinical
specimens, and translated with FD analysis into an easily disseminated tool to predict impending lung disease
progression, and thus enable interventions before permanent lung damage occurs. Guided by combined MRI
and proteomic data and the utility of FD analysis to predict lung function decline, our central hypothesis will be
tested by completing the following Specific Aims: 1) Validate our predictive biomarkers in CF patients with normal
spirometry but abnormal ventilation; 2) determine the sensitivity and specificity of systemic biomarkers in pre-
dicting early structural re-modeling in CF lung disease; and 3) perform clinical bronchoscopy to identify molecular
signatures of irreversible lung remodeling. We have developed the MRI sequences and reconstruction pipeline
needed to complete the work. For Aims 1 & 2, we have used MRI and MS proteomics to identify key biomarkers
to predict structural and functional abnormalities in CF. For Aim 3, we have used BAL proteomics to identify
molecular changes at the pathway level in CF patients. The proposed research is innovative, because it will use
cutting-edge imaging to validate molecular tools to assess early lung disease. These results will be significant,
because they will produce an easily disseminated tool to predict permanent structural remodelling and irreversi-
ble functional losses. This work will have an immediate positive impact by developing and translating non-inva-
sive tests to identify CF patients at high risk of lung damage and intervene before irreversible changes occur. It
will also provide a unique platform to assess pathological progression in a wide range of lung diseases."

It is well known that stem cell differentiation and cell fate are regulated by mechanical forces and mechanics.
We have reported earlier that cell mechanical properties dictate stress-induced spreading and differentiation in
embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Other reports have also demonstrated the effect of forces on pluripotent stem
cells. However, how force regulates (pluripotent) stem cell differentiation and cell fate at the level of chromatin
remains elusive. This is an important question since the chromatin is the hub of gene transcription and DNA
replication and DNA damage repair, critical for pluripotent stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and cancer
stem cell self-renewal. Our preliminary results chromatin domain stretching but not compression rapidly and
nuclear protein LAP2β mediates force transmission from nuclear lamina to chromatin. In addition, RNA
polymerase II (Pol II) is recruited and elongated in response to stretching but not compression and demethylation
of H3K9me3 is necessary for force-induced gene upregulation. Built on these results, we propose 3 specific aims
to elucidate nuclear mechanobiology mechanisms in the living cells. Aim 1: To determine if chromatin stretching
is necessary for force-induced stem cell differentiation; Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that H3K9me3 and H3K9ac

are rigorous and the likelihood of generating insightful discovery is high. The long-term goal is to develop novel
approaches and strategies to intervene pathological processes like malignant tumors."

critical treatment for nearly every patient with GBM and has repeatedly improved patient survival
in multiple randomized trials. Still, 80% of GBMs recur within the high dose RT field. Thus, there
is a critical need to develop strategies to overcome GBM RT-resistance to further improve patient
outcomes. GBM cells exhibit profound cancer-specific metabolic abnormalities, including elevated
purine synthesis, to fuel proliferation, invasion and survival. We have found that the metabolic
phenotype of elevated purine synthesis also mediates resistance to RT in GBM by promoting the
repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Recently, we have discovered that non-malignant cells in the
GBM microenvironment promote purine metabolism and RT resistance in glioma cells. In this
research proposal, we will (1) determine the metabolic mechanisms by which non-malignant cells
regulate GBM metabolism and RT resistance, (2) measure the activity of these metabolic
pathways in GBM tumors in patients and (3) interrupt this regulation in patients with GBM by
combining an FDA-approved and CNS-penetrant inhibitor of purine metabolism with standard of
care RT and temozolomide in a phase 1B clinical trial."
10754948,"While adoptive T cell therapies (e.g., anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells) have demonstrated
remarkable outcomes in patients with leukemias and lymphomas, significant variability remains in the potency
and durability of the antitumor response, and their success against solid tumors has been limited. Previous
studies have identified several key determinants of therapeutic efficacy, including distinct T-cell subpopulations
in the CAR-T cell infusion product. CAR-T cell production generally requires ex vivo T-cell activation and
expansion, and critical attributes of the CAR-T cell infusion product, including its proliferative capacity,
persistence, and antitumor potency, are widely determined during this process. Significant research over the
past two decades has established that extracellular matrix (ECM) elasticity, or stiffness, impacts many
fundamental cell processes, and impacts various aspects of T cell biology (e.g., synapse formation). However,
tissues and ECMs are not linearly elastic materials. The ECM is viscoelastic, with its response to mechanical
loading being time dependent. Strong effects of matrix viscoelasticity on stem cell differentiation have been
demonstrated, but the interplay of matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity on T cell activation is unknown. This
project addresses the hypothesis that matrix viscoelasticity and stiffness during activation will directly impact T
cell phenotype and therapeutic efficacy. This hypothesis will be explored via the following specific aims: (1)
Assess the effects of matrix viscoelasticity and stiffness on T cell phenotype using ECM mimetic hydrogels
with tunable stiffness and viscoelasticity, (2) Explore the mechanism by which matrix mechanics regulate T cell
differentiation during activation, and its relation to T cells isolated from patients using scRNA-seq analysis and
focusing on the AP-1 pathway, and (3) Elucidate the functional effects of changes in T cell state induced by
matrix mechanics both in vitro and in vivo using adoptive transfer studies. Completion of these studies will
provide fundamental knowledge regarding the role of matrix mechanics on T cell phenotype and function, with
a potential impact on approaches to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapies."
10757465,"Project Summary. As a major cAMP-specific hydrolyzing enzyme, PDE7 plays a significant role in modulating
immune and inflammatory response in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
PDE7 treatment not only improved the memory and behavior in transgenic models of AD but also exhibited decreased
brain Aβ deposition, enhanced Aβ degradation, and decreased tau phosphorylation. The mechanism of action was
mediated via the cAMP-specific neuroinmmune response in AD. Positron emission tomograohy (PET) is capable of
quantifying biochemical processes in vivo, and a suitable PDE7 ligand would substantially improve our understanding
of such cAMP-mediated signaling under different pathophysiological AD conditions, otherwise inaccessible by ex vivo
(destructive) analysis. Quantification of PDE7 in living brain by PET would also provide the assessment of distribution,
target engagement and dose occupancy of new PDE7-targeted neurotherapeutics. To date, no successful examples
have been demonstrated to image PDE7 in human, representing a significant deficiency of our ability to study this
target in vivo. Therefore, we propose to develop a novel PDE7 PET ligand that can fill this void as the first successful
and translational imaging tool.
 We are the first groups to develop PDE7-specific ligands in cross-species PET studies, including [11C]P7-2104
developed in 2021. However, this ligand was discontinued due to marginal binding specificity in vivo. In our 2nd
generation, we identified a lead molecule, P7-2526, which showed high binding affinity and excellent selectivity. Our
preliminary evaluation confirmed that we have overcome the two major obstacles for PDE7 ligand development by
achieving: 1) substantially-improved binding affinity, representing the best compound to date; and 2) high target
specificity (characteristic high uptake in PDE7-rich striatum and low in PDE7-poor cerebellum/pons, which was
validated by LC-MS and Western blotting). Though P7-2526 is a promising lead for new PDE7-targeted ligands, further
optimization for improved binding specificity with proper brain kinetics are sought for translational cross-species
(rodents and nonhuman primates) imaging studies to achieve optimal PDE7 quantification for drug discovery and
clinical translation for AD patients.
 On the basis that P7-2526 serves a validated lead for medicinal chemistry optimization, as specific goals, we will
design and prepare a focused library of PDE7-specific modulators amenable for labeling with 11C or 18F, and evaluate
their ability to quantify PDE7 activity and changes during drug challenge in rodents and nonhuman primates, as well
as autoradiography and biological validation in postmortem human brain tissues. The impact of this work is not only
to develop the first successful high-affinity and selective PDE7 PET ligand for the study of neurodegenerative disease-
related biological processes, but also ultimately, via PET imaging validation in higher species, to advance this ligand
for potential clinical translation and monitor target response of novel neurotherapeutics for neurodegenerative
diseases, including AD."
10854970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Live donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic and end-stage
kidney disease. LDKT is less expensive than prolonged dialysis and offers improved mortality and morbidity
over either dialysis or deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKT). However, ethnic minorities have significantly
less access to LDKT than their White counterparts. Collectively, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics represent
64.3% of the kidney transplant wait list, yet received only 36% of all LDKTs in 2019. Further, rates of LDKTs
have decreased for Black patients over the last decade. Decades of research point to patient-provider
communication as a contributing factor to observed disparities in health and healthcare outcomes. To date,
however, no attempt has been made to gauge the impact of the communication occurring during transplant
evaluation consultations on LDKT outcomes. The long-term goal of the proposed study entitled, Increasing
Equity in Live Donor Kidney Transplant through Effective Patient-Provider Communication, is to increase parity
in access to LDKT for Black patients. We propose a community-engaged, mixed-methods study employing a
concurrent triangulation design to identify the specific communicative behaviors that result in live donor
inquiries and evaluations, and actual LDKTs for Caucasian and Black patients, providing critical information to
the design of an intervention to improve patient-provider communication about LDKT. Specifically, we will
simultaneously quantitatively assess patient and provider factors with established and hypothesized
associations with receipt of LDKTs, and qualitatively assess discrete elements of patient-provider
communication occurring during transplant evaluation consultations for Caucasian and Black patients (Aim 1).
Brief quantitative surveys administered before and after medical consultations held as part of the evaluation for
transplant candidacy will capture providers’ (N=52) confidence and comfort discussing LDKT and patients’
satisfaction with the consultation, medical mistrust, health literacy, and LDKT knowledge, attitudes and
readiness. We will also audiorecord transplant evaluation consultations for 60 Caucasian and 60 Black patients
(N=120) across the two study sites – Saint Barnabas Medical Center (NJ) and Temple University Hospital
(PA), and qualitatively assess the communication occurring during the consultations. We will use the findings
to inform development of the content and format of a communication skills training for transplant providers and
evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the training on patient-reported and LDKT process outcomes (Aims 2
& 3). Intervening at the provider level is both practical, given that all transplant candidates already must
undergo this consultation, and efficient, given that a single transplant physician can evaluate >100 transplant
candidates per year. Thus, the results of this innovative study have the potential to increase access to LDKT
for Black patients currently awaiting kidney transplant. Improving communication during the transplant
consultation may prove to be an effective and efficient means of alleviating ethnic disparities in LDKT."
10793651,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Transendothelial migration (TEM), or diapedesis, is the step in which leukocytes squeeze between tightly
apposed endothelial cells that line the post-capillary venules at sites of inflammation. Most of the good, the bad,
and the ugly of inflammation occurs after leukocytes cross blood vessels. A thorough understanding of the
molecules and mechanisms that regulate TEM should therefore enhance our ability to control the process
therapeutically. Therefore, my lab has been studying this process for 30 years. We have made some of the
seminal discoveries in the field, including the identification and discovery of: 1.Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
molecule-1 (PECAM) and CD99 as major selective regulators of TEM and 2. their downstream signaling
pathways leading to TEM; 3.The lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC), an interconnected reticulum of
tubule-vesicular membrane that recycles locally along the endothelial cell borders; 4.That the surface molecules
involved in TEM (PECAM, CD99, etc.) work sequentially in the process as the leukocyte passes through the
endothelial cell border; 5.That the act of TEM promotes differentiation of some monocytes into dendritic cells; 6.
That paracellular and transcellular TEM of leukocytes use the same machinery and mechanisms.
 Whether we approached TEM from the standpoint of the leukocyte or the endothelial cell, the surface
adhesion/signaling molecules, the intracellular signaling pathways, membrane dynamics, or endothelial cell
ultrastructure, we consistently and independently converged on a final common mechanism regardless of
whether we were studying neutrophils, monocytes, or T cells; regardless of the inflammatory conditions or
models studied: TEM required the targeted movement of the LBRC along microtubules to the site at which the
leukocyte was migrating. All of the molecules that we studied worked to activate this mechanism. Anything that
inhibited this “targeted recycling of the LBRC” inhibited TEM by 80-90% in vitro and in vivo.
 The biggest shortcoming of existing anti-inflammatory therapies is that they also block beneficial
inflammation. We have developed biochemical and genetic tools to selectively block targeted recycling of the
LBRC and hence TEM in multiple in vivo models of inflammatory disease. Since these reagents and inducible
EC-selective knockout mice only affect EC, all other aspects of the innate and adaptive inflammatory responses
remain intact. Since we are only able to block TEM by 80–90%, the 10–20% of leukocytes that escape blockade
enter the tissues able to mount a normal inflammatory response. Our preliminary data show that we can diminish
the intensity of maladaptive inflammation without interfering with the ability of the host to mount desirable
inflammatory responses and remain healthy. We will test this hypothesis in a number of models of acute and
chronic inflammation. We will also use our ability to selective block TEM at selected time points to study the role
of TEM in the initiation, progression, and resolution of disease. The molecules and mechanisms that regulate
TEM in the pulmonary vascular bed are unknown. We will identify them and compare to the systemic circulation."
10774282,"Project Summary:
Lipogenesis is essential for normal physiology and its dysregulation is a notable feature of obesity, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegeneration and infection. Classical regulation of de novo
lipogenesis involves transcriptional regulation of lipogenic gene expression via hormone mediated SREBP
activation, and/or carbohydrate sensing via ChREBP activation. However, neither program facilitates
substrate handling nor set the cellular energy status amenable to lipogenic conditions. The mitochondria,
specifically the TCA cycle, is the putative source of acetyl-CoA used for lipid synthesis but before transport
to the cytosol, it is converted to citrate, a step that consumes TCA cycle intermediates. The balance
between TCA cycle cataplerosis (loss of TCA cycle intermediates) and anaplerosis (replenishment of TCA
cycle intermediates) and may help to determine the rate at which citrate can be used for lipid synthesis.
These pathways are known to be disrupted in many diseases, that also have pathological lipid metabolism.
Thus, we will examine how anaplerotic and cataplerotic pathways of the TCA cycle help to mediate the
appropriate lipogenic response to nutrition, by promoting substrate (e.g. citrate) availability and/or cellular
energy status necessary for lipogenic reactions. We will use state of the art stable isotope tracers, analytical
chemistry platforms and mouse genetics to evaluate the role of these pathways in controlling rates of lipid
synthesis. Completion of this project will identify new metabolic mechanisms for the regulation of lipid
synthesis that complement transcriptional mechanisms and may have particular relevance to the growing
list of diseases known to disrupt TCA cycle metabolism."
10744776,"The past decade has seen a significant increase in the incidence of emerging virus infections that transmit directly from animals to humans or are vectored by mosquitos and ticks. Changes in demographics and climatic factors likely contribute to this increase. In the United States, ticks are the dominant vector for transmitting arthropod borne diseases including the Thogotovirus, Bourbon virus (BRBV) which can cause fatal disease in humans. Like other enveloped viruses, entry of BRBV begins with attachment to host-cell receptor molecules with subsequent membrane fusion to deliver the contents of the virion into the host cell. Viral attachment and fusion proteins are targeted by antibodies that contribute to our natural immunity against viruses and are consequently a validated therapeutic target. The single envelope glycoprotein (GP) of BRBV is responsible for both attachment to cellular receptors and catalyzing fusion. BRBV GP is structurally related to the envelope glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus, gB of herpes simplex virus, and GP64 of baculovirus which collectively are termed class III fusogens. Our understanding of class III fusogens and their inhibition lags behind the class I and II viral fusogens, exemplified by influenza HA, and flavivirus E respectively. We have developed a set of unique tools and reagents that will allow us to characterize existing and newly developed monoclonal antibodies against BRBV GP both structurally and functionally. We will identify those that are potently neutralizing, identify their mechanism of inhibition, test the efficacy of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies in a mouse model of disease, and identify the breadth of related thogotoviruses against which such antibodies function. Using chimeric VSV reporter viruses that depend on the GP of BRBV for infection, we will define the precise step in entry by which specific antibodies impede infection. We will also determine the entry pathway of BRBV into cells and define the host requirements for this process. In preliminary data, we carried out a CRISPR inactivation screen that identified glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG) as an important host factor for entry of BRBV into mammalian cells and demonstrate related thogotoviruses are also dependent upon UGCG. Using a combination of genetic approaches, coupled with pharmacological inhibition and imaging of single virions during entry, we will precisely delineate the requirement for UGCG in entry, and identify and characterize additional host factors coopted during this process. Genetic and structural studies will permit us to map the critical determinants on GP required to coopt host-factors during the entry pathway, which will synergize with our antibody studies to provide a detailed mechanistic picture of entry and its inhibition. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide new insights into the mechanism and structural requirements for attachment, internalization and membrane fusion driven by a class III fusogen, uncover the mechanism by which the host glucosylceramide synthase functions in entry, and identify antibodies that target GP to block those critical functions."
11162101,"Hydrocephalus (HC) is a common and debilitating neurological condition affecting up to 1 in 500 individuals.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) has been the standard treatment for >60 years but shunts remain highly
problematic, with an unacceptably high malfunction rate and often lead to a lifetime of complex neurosurgical
care. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative to shunting but has limited efficacy in infants.
Adding choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) to ETV seems to be a viable alternative to shunting infants. Despite
conflicting outcomes, ETV-CPC is currently being offered routinely and globally, and with limited understanding
of the risks or benefits of this procedure on brain development. The lack of knowledge about both the surgical
and physiological consequences of ETV-CPC constitutes a significant barrier to broad acceptance of this
procedure. For example, the impact of ablating the choroid plexus, a major homeostatic organ which regulates
neurogenesis and neurodevelopment, has yet to be determined. Experimental studies are needed to determine
the role of ETV and ETV-CPC in clinical practice, but the lack of appropriate, validated large animal models in
which to test these techniques on brain physiology and, critically, on brain development, has never been studied.
Our hypothesis-driven proposal builds on our foundational work that developed a large, clinically-relevant animal
model of HC in juvenile domestic pigs and demonstrated feasibility of ETV+CPC, and VPS, thus continuing the
goals of NIH PA-180-623, “Tools to Enhance the Study of Prenatal and Pediatric Hydrocephalus”. Three Specific
Aims will test our Central Hypothesis that, compared with VPS, ETV+CPC impairs brain development through
disruption of VZ/SVZ and PVWM precursor biology and CSF homeostasis with pro-inflammatory signaling: Aim
1 - compare the cytological effects of VPS and ETV+CPC on VZ/SVZ and PVWM; Aim 2 - determine the effect
of VPS and ETV+CPC on choroid plexus and CSF profile; Aim 3 - compare neurobehavioral and cognitive
outcomes in HC animals treated with VPS and ETV+CPC. Supporting these aims are published and preliminary
data showing cytopathology in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and periventricular white matter (PVWM) following
treatment with VPS and ETV+CPC, ventricular zone (VZ) disruption, SVZ/PVWM cell death, glial activation, and
heterotopia, PVWM glial activation and reduced oligodendrocyte progenitors, flow cytometry and single cell RNA
sequencing differences in microglia and precursor lineages, CSF cellular and protein alterations, and reduced
cognitive assessments. Analyses will be performed at 30- and 90-days post-treatment. Pigs were chosen for
studies for their close homology to human neuroanatomy and physiology and the ability to use standard clinical
neurosurgical techniques. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fill a critical void in HC research
through rigorous testing of emerging surgical procedures and injury mechanisms, which is essential to identifying
best neurosurgical practices for the clinical management of HC."

Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is the most common and life-threatening airborne opportunistic fungal pathogen.
Investigations into Af pathogenesis have focused primarily on mono-species infections. The impact of co-
infecting microbes on Af physiology during infection remains an understudied but critically important research
area. Using cystic fibrosis (CF) infection as a model, my recent work has focused on characterizing Af physiology
in the presence and absence of the coinfecting bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), using multi-
omics approaches combined with reverse genetics. I have uncovered two major mechanisms of Af and Pa
interkingdom communication, mediated through the toxic, microbial secondary metabolites gliotoxin (produced
by Af) and hydrogen cyanide (produced by Pa). The proposed project builds logically on this work and aims to
uncover the mechanistic basis underlying the physiological shifts which occur in both organisms upon coculture
in synthetic CF sputum media. This work will also test if clinical isolates of Af and Pa maintain these secondary
metabolite response networks after chronic human infection and test to what extent polymicrobial interactions
impact Af physiology during human infection using advanced sequencing technologies. The overall goal of this
application is two-fold: 1) to define the specific molecular basis for interactions that occur between Af and Pa
(Specific Aim 1); and 2) to expand on these findings to determine the impact of microbial interactions and the
host environment on Af physiology during human CF infection (Specific Aim 2). This work is likely to yield
important discoveries that will aid in our understanding of both fungal physiology and the underlying mechanisms
of interkingdom microbial interactions within chronic polymicrobial infections."

Significant progress in human cancer therapy in the last decade has been driven by conceptionally new
approaches to treating cancer, including cancer immunotherapy, cancer nanotherapy (e.g. liposomal doxorubicin
or mRNA vaccines), or new types of biologics and small molecules. I propose to develop new approaches to
targeting protein-membrane interactions that could yield unprecedented methods to modulate cancer signaling
and generate useful paradigms for pharmacology at large. The role of protein-membrane and drug-membrane
interactions will be explored and targeted on various levels, each highly relevant to cancer pharmacology:
1. Cancer signaling, a hallmark of cancer, is largely dependent on the recruitment of kinases (e.g. PI3K or PKC)
and GTPases (e.g. RAS) to hotspots localized at the inner plasma membrane leaflet. I aim to develop bifunctional
inhibitors with the capacity to modulate these interactions as a new approach to target cancer signaling.
2a. Membrane-integrated receptors are also key players in cellular signaling (e.g. enzyme-linked receptors or
GPCRs). Recently, a number of pharmacophores have been discovered that target these proteins directly from
the intramembrane space. These `Intramembrane pharmacophores' first partition into the membrane and then
engage their target through lateral diffusion and entry. I aim to systematically modulate membrane exposed
pharmacophore sites to explore principles governing the action of these pharmacophores which in turn will aid
in the discoveries of new intramembrane pharmacophores.
2b. The majority of bioactive molecules acts on membrane proteins or intracellular targets and therefore needs
to partition into or cross biological membranes. I propose to use combinatorial chemistry to discover new
principles and chemical structures that modulate and privilege pharmacophores for cellular uptake. These will
be tested in live cells using high throughput assays as a holistic approach to covering all possible uptake
mechanisms on the first level of screening (e.g. endocytosis, transporters, passive diffusion).
Combined, the proposed research will provide important insights into the functional role of protein-
membrane interactions in cancer signaling and their vulnerability to small molecule-based modulation.
Each of the proposed directions has the potential to yield fundamentally new and unprecedented
approaches to targeting cancer and other diseases.
My mentor and collaborators have extensive experience in cancer pharmacology, drug discovery, and the
biophysical characterization of protein-membrane interfaces and will provide the training needed to conduct the
proposed research. They will also provide the mentorship needed to acquire all skills and preliminary data
needed for a successful transition to an independent career in cancer research."
10908271,"Project Abstract:
We have identified novel roles of the eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase (eSTK) signaling pathway in
mediating broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
 Broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance, which renders most β-lactam drugs therapeutically ineffective, is
classically mediated through mecA, the gene that encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a. Broad-spectrum
resistance to β-lactams in S. aureus also occurs through non-classical mediators not directly related to mecA.
The role played by the non-classical mediators in β-lactam resistance is only superficially understood. Both Stk1
and Stp1 (effectors of eSTK signaling; a serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase), mediate β-lactam sensitivity
by loss of function or overexpression respectively, whereas functional Stk1 and non-functional Stp1 favor drug
resistance. Our results show that eSTK modulates β-lactam resistance via pathways controlling mecA
expression and through unknown non-classical mediators independently regulated by Stk1 and Stp1.
 mecA expression in community MRSA strains (and many hospital strains as well) is regulated by the BlaR1-
BlaI regulatory pathway. Expression of mecA is normally suppressed by the transcriptional repressor, BlaI.
Presence of β-lactam drugs is sensed by BlaR1, an integral membrane protein. Subsequently, BlaR1 undergoes
a site-specific auto-proteolysis releasing its intracellular zinc metalloprotease (ZnMP) domain into the bacterial
cytosol. The released ZnMP degrades BlaI to de-repress mecA expression, leading to drug resistance. Our data
show that eSTK mediated phosphorylation of BlaR1 is important for efficient mecA induction.
 Through passaging studies, we have identified compensatory mechanisms that enable the bacteria to
overcome drug sensitivity due to Stk1 loss of function or Stp1 overexpression, mentioned above. Genome
sequencing studies carried out to decipher the basis of resistance in passaged strains indicated involvement of
pathways that are unrelated to mecA.
 Three aims are proposed: a) to decipher the mechanism through which eSTK controls mecA expression, b)
to identify eSTK mediators that confer non-classical β-lactam resistance, and c) to investigate the compensatory
basis of resistance among resistant passaged strains.
 Our study will help determine the mechanism/s through which Stk1 and Stp1 control β-lactam resistance and
could help to identify novel and improved treatment options for S. aureus infections."
10802363,"The record of safety and efficacy of the four FDA–approved drugs for erectile dysfunction, namely tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil and avanafil, is predicated on their ability to potently inhibit the cellular enzyme, phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A). PDE5A hydrolyzes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), so that PDE5A inhibitors stimulate the nitric oxide–cGMP–protein kinase G (PKG) pathway. In 1991, we documented for the first time that nitric oxide regulates the osteoclast, the cell that resorbs bone (PMID: 1849281). Multiple studies have since established robust effects of modulating this pathway on both components of bone remodeling – bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. Prompted by observations that erectile dysfunction and osteoporosis track together in older men, in men with diabetes, and in men receiving androgen–deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, we sought to investigate the action of tadalafil and vardenafil on bone. The overarching hypothesis was that PDE5A inhibitors could be repurposed for the co–therapy of erectile dysfunction and osteoporosis in men and, even perhaps, solely for osteoporosis in women. We found in mouse studies that tadalafil and vardenafil increased bone mass, importantly in female mice, by stimulating bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption (Kim et al, PNAS, In press). Despite net bone gain, the anabolic action of the drugs was antagonized by a unique sympathetic relay signature originating from central PDE5A–positive neurons in the locus coeruleus, raphe pallidus and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Noting that most osteoporosis drugs are either anti–resorptive or anabolic, any dual–acting agent will
have unique value particularly with oral use. Therefore, towards the potential for repurposing PDE5A inhibitors for osteoporosis, our current goal is to understand precisely how the drugs work on bone and to evaluate preclinical efficacy in models of bone loss. In Specific Aim 1, using global and cell–selective knock out mice, we will determine whether the drugs inhibit PDE5A to activate the NO–cGMP–PKG2 pathway in bone, and if so, which cell is the primary target. In Specific Aim 2, we will comprehensively map the distribution of PDE5A in brain at the single transcript level by RNAscope, and interrogate PDE5A–positive nodes through AAV–mediated Pde5a overexpression or knock down. In Specific Aim 3, we will study the ability of tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil and/or avanafil to trigger bone gain in 1–year–old aging mice; to prevent hypogonadal bone loss in rats and mice; and to restore bone that is already lost 28 weeks following ovariectomy in rats. Together, our mechanistic and efficacy studies should provide a firm foundation for future clinical trials towards repurposing PDE5A inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."

provides a minimum of $250,000 per year for P/F grant awards; additional funding may be provided for
highly-rated applications using funds provided by the University of Michigan (U-M). The MDRC P/F program
will fund two types of awards: (1) standard one-year $50,000 P/F awards with a single PI, and (2) two-year,
$100,000 Diabetes Interdisciplinary Studies Program (DISP) awards that seek to support and promote new
collaborations between two or more U-M faculty members from distinct disciplines, to focus their combined
research strengths on cutting-edge areas in diabetes research. Each year, the MDRC solicits applications for
P/F and DISP grants from full-time instructional or research faculty at U-M. Those eligible include: 1) new
investigators without past or current NIH research support who are beginning careers in diabetes research,
2) established investigators who have not previously worked in diabetes research but wish to focus their
expertise on diabetes, and 3) established diabetes investigators who propose innovative research in
diabetes that represents a clear departure from their ongoing research. Highest priority is given to new
investigators. Applications are actively solicited from across U-M and are peer-reviewed by two or more
extramural reviewers with expertise in the area of the application. Grant applications with the highest merit,
as judged by this review process and the MDRC Grants Program Advisory Council, receive awards. The
balance between standard P/F and DISP awards may vary from year to year, depending upon the relative
strength of applications for each award type. The ultimate goal of the program is to enable awardees to

10763873,"Electrical block of neural conduction has myriad potential clinical applications including treatment of pain and
autonomic dysfunction such as heart failure, diabetes and inflammation. However, these therapeutic targets
require block of small diameter myelinated Ad- and B-fibers and unmyelinated C-fibers, while the majority of prior
studies of block were on block of large diameter myelinated Aa-fibers. The continued development of nerve block
and its clinical translation are limited by: (1) the high energy required for conduction block, especially for the
small diameter nerve fibers most relevant for bioelectronic therapies, (2) the strong excitatory response that
occurs at the onset of blocking signals, which is likely to be exacerbated by the high block thresholds of small
diameter axons, and (3) the lack of control over which specific nerve fibers are blocked, such that blocking small
diameter axons also results in block of larger diameter axons. We propose rigorous engineering design to
optimize the performance of nerve block waveforms and electrodes and in vivo testing of their performance in
both small and large animals. Aim 1 is to optimize simultaneously the waveform and electrode geometry to meet
each of three distinct performance criteria: minimize energy required for block, minimize onset response
associated with the initiation of block, and enable selective block of small diameter axons (myelinated Ad- or B-
fibers or unmyelinated C-fibers) while preserving conduction in large diameter Aa-fibers. We will combine
validated computational models with engineering optimization via a particle swarm algorithm to design new
waveform shapes and electrode geometries to achieve our performance metrics and thereby greatly increase
the utility of nerve conduction block. In Aim 2, we will measure the responses of different types of nerve fibers
(A-, B-, and C-fibers) in both the vagus nerve and the sciatic nerve of anesthetized rats to compare the
performance of optimized block waveforms and electrode geometries to conventional waveform shapes
(sinusoids, rectangular pulses) and electrode geometries (bipolar, tripolar) used for block of nerve fiber
conduction. In Aim 3 we will measure both nerve fiber responses and physiological responses, including
electromyograms and changes in heart rate, to block of the pig vagus nerve to quantify performance, including
energy, onset response, and selectivity, in a large, multi-fascicular nerve that represents well human nerves.
The outcomes will be novel waveforms and electrode geometries that overcome the performance limitations of
current approaches to conduction block including the high energy requirements, the strong excitatory onset
response, and the lack of control over which specific nerve fibers are blocked. These enhanced capabilities will
advance electrical nerve block as an experimental tool and provide technologies to enable the continued
translation of new bioelectronic therapies."
10841568,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There has been a revolution in biomedicine fueled by the development of next generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies which has made it possible to address biological questions at a
systems level. Now, instead of determining the effect of perturbing one gene, all genes can be
assessed simultaneously. Instead of asking how a transcription factor binds to a single promoter
or enhancer, all binding sites for that factor can be determined in a single experiment. In addition
to looking at expression events across all the cells within a complex, heterogenous tissue, we can
determine changes at the single cell level. Taking advantage of these approaches involves the
application of specialized technical and analytical skills beyond the reach of most individual
laboratories. Mindful of these issues, and of the need to apply cutting edge genome-wide
technology to questions of relevance to diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disease, we have
established a Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Core. The goals of this Core are to provide
access to state-of-the-art methods to members of the BADERC community in order to enhance
and facilitate a deeper understanding of how metabolic disease develops, and how it can be
diagnosed and treated."
10755740,"Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 1 in 4 deaths a year in the US. CVD-related risk factors such as
hypertension and diabetes emerge in mid-life (50-64 years old) compromising healthy aging into older
adulthood (65 yrs+). Mid-life also shows a widening in socio-demographic disparities in CVD-related risk
factors. Disparities (e.g., those related to income, race, and ethnicity) are driven in part by “social determinants
of health” like neighborhood resources. Resources—including sources of healthful food and amenities for
physical activity—tend to be fewer in number and lesser in quality in certain neighborhoods. Recognizing this
reality, there is increasing policy interest in redeveloping under-resourced neighborhoods. “Neighborhood
redevelopment” is a process through which rezoning and capital investment can bring new resources to
neighborhoods—e.g., sources of healthful food and amenities for physical activity. While redevelopment might
therefore support better health (including health related to CVD), potential benefits may not be realized equally
among all socio-demographic groups. For example, if housing costs increase as neighborhood resources
improve, residents having lower income or fixed budgets may be increasingly challenged to afford other health-
related needs. In fact, the net impact of neighborhood redevelopment among different socio-demographic
groups is not clear. Better data is needed to understand how redevelopment could affect health and health
disparities. To examine the relationship between neighborhood redevelopment and CVD-related health/health
disparities, the proposed study will use three complementary approaches: (1) a natural experiment, (2)
qualitative analysis, and (3) micro-simulation and systems dynamics modeling. First, we will take advantage of
a redevelopment initiative in the Bronx, NY, where a largely commercial area is being rezoned and capital
investments are being made to increase healthful neighborhood resources. Using a primary care sample
identified through electronic health records, we will follow cohorts of mid-life and older patients in both the
redevelopment area and a comparison area. We will compare clinically measured incident CVD and other
CVD-related risk factors to understand how redevelopment effects cardiovascular health over time. In
particular, we will examine the mediating effects of food and physical-activity and related resources. Second,
through purposively sampling of informative patients, we will use in-person “walk-along” interviews to
understand how residents perceive neighborhood access to healthful resources during ongoing
redevelopment. Third, we will use a validated micro-simulation model that projects long-term effects of
redevelopment on CVD-related outcomes. Fourth, we will use system dynamics modeling to synthesize salient
findings from quantitative and qualitative data sources to inform future implementation of redevelopment
strategies. This study demonstrates a transferable method of quantifying the impact of redevelopment in an
area actively undergoing this process using both clinical and community data."
10909325,"The proposed work is focused on restoration of hand and reaching functions for people
with cervical level spinal cord injury. For individuals who have sustained this injury, restoration
of hand function is their top priority, and existing alternatives are limited. Neuroprostheses are
the most promising method for significant gain in hand and arm function.
In this CREATE project, we propose to prepare for a future pivotal clinical trial by
transfer of a third-generation neuroprosthetic, the Networked Neuroprosthesis, to two clinical
trial sites. The effort will enable the development and evaluation of a clinical training program,
establish the effectiveness of device transferability, and bring valuable clinical and patient
experience into the product development cycle. The work represents an interim step between
our Early Feasibility IDE experience which is currently underway, and a future Pivotal Clinical
Trial.
In the first phase of the proposed work, we will harden the implantable system for
manufacture, and complete the verification and validation that will be necessary to perform a
pivotal clinical trial. In the second phase, we will extend our Early Feasibility study by selecting
and training two beta sites to test the feasibility of our training materials and procedures, our
technology and medical/surgical procedures of implementation, and our outcome evaluations, in
order to establish our system’s readiness for further translation to a Pivotal Clinical Trial.
Following this work, our intent would be to undertake further expansion of the study to a Pivotal
Clinical Trial in order to collect the definitive dataset necessary for full regulatory approval and
market release that would enable successful commercialization and broader access for people
with spinal cord injuries. This effort is coupled with an overall strategy for sustainable
dissemination of this technology to the SCI population. Thus, the impact from this study is not
only to demonstrate the benefits of a single clinical application, but the impact also extends to
the entire field of SCI and similar orphan diseases through the establishment of a sustainable
entity that can assure the availability of implanted neuroprostheses to the individuals who can
benefit from them."
10828744,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Deemed a “Twin Epidemic” or “Fourth Wave”, epidemiological evidence emphasizes rapidly increasing public
health harms of methamphetamine use among people who use opioids. These data are particularly worrisome
given there are no FDA approved pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine use or established treatments for
methamphetamine/opioid co-use. A promising target for the regulation of stimulant and opioid motivation is the
orexin system. Preclinical and early clinical findings suggest that orexin system antagonism is a clinically viable
approach to selectively reduce motivation for both opioids and stimulants. Human laboratory data are needed to
investigate this mechanism and extend it to a co-use setting. This project will address this gap by using a
behavioral economic demand framework to evaluate motivation for use of opioids, methamphetamine, and their
combination in people with opioid use disorder. Demand analyses will directly inform the direction of subsequent
treatment studies by identifying motives for opioid-methamphetamine co-use and determining whether these
drugs act as substitutes (i.e., as consumption of one decreases, consumption of the other increases), which
would necessitate treatments that target both drugs to avoid breakthrough use, or as complements (i.e., as
consumption of one decreases, consumption of the other decreases), which would support treatments that target
one drug to concomitantly decrease use of the other. This is an optimal approach that will inform more
expeditious development of treatment trials and reduce risk of inducing harm with identification of incorrect
targets. We will conduct a residential human laboratory study with non-treatment seeking participants with opioid
use disorder. Participants will complete sessions with blinded administration of oral methamphetamine,
oxycodone, their combination, and placebo. Validated demand measures sensitive to pharmacological
manipulation will determine own-price demand (commodity alone) and cross-commodity demand (concurrent
commodities). Participants will be randomized to receive oral suvorexant or placebo throughout the residential
stay. We hypothesize that orexin antagonism will result in higher demand elasticity (lower drug use motivation)
for methamphetamine, oxycodone, and their combination. We also hypothesize that the majority of participants
will show a demand response in which methamphetamine serves as a substitute for oxycodone use, suggesting
that treatments will be needed to target both drugs to avoid breakthrough use. Secondary analyses will evaluate
sleep disturbances on non-session days and days in which study drug (methamphetamine, oxycodone, or their
combination) is administered and we hypothesize fewer sleep disturbances in the suvorexant condition. This
work will use translational laboratory methods to evaluate pharmacological and behavioral mechanisms
underlying opioid, stimulant, and co-use motivation, providing insight into and treatment directives for a co-use
trend of increasing public health harm."

Project Summary
Measles is caused by a notably stable virus and has been vaccine preventable since the 1960s,
following commercialization of the first effective measles vaccine in the U.S. But after the first
several years—and then decades—of measles vaccination, U.S. medical and public health experts
began to remark on how distinctly vaccination was changing measles's epidemiology, altering
the geographic, racial, age, and income groups most and least affected by the disease. This oft-
made observation, however, overlooked measles' long history. Extant for thousands of years,
measles had always been shaped by the times and places in which it made its appearance.
Urbanization, colonization, trade, war, schooling patterns, treatment, and other social, cultural,
political, scientific, and economic factors shaped and reshaped measles over and over, changing
it from epidemic to endemic to eliminated and back again, from “severe” to “mild” and vice
versa, and from a universal scourge to a commonplace feature of childhood. In the era of
modern biomedicine, measles has repeatedly been described as one of the deadliest and most
contagious diseases, as well as one of the most eradicable—a scientific belief resting on
assumptions about measles' stability that are in fact a small part of its centuries-long story.
This project will construct a global history of measles by following the disease from medieval
Islamic clinical descriptions to contemporary battles over its elimination. The project has three
specific aims. First, it will produce the first book on the global history of measles, with a focus on
how conceptions and perceptions of measles rooted in space and time have long made measles
both a stable and dynamic illness. Second, it will analyze measles' historical roles in the
emergence and development of what is now called global health. Third, it will examine and
elucidate measles' practical and symbolic historical significance in efforts to manage other
infectious diseases over time, from smallpox to COVID. The book will be published by Polity
Press and written for an audience of academics, policymakers, advocates, and the public.
Research methods for this historical project include both secondary source synthesis and
primary source location and analysis. The project draws on a broad secondary literature on the
histories of infectious disease, epidemics, medicine, and global health. Its primary source base
consists of evidence from databases of periodicals, government reports, and scientific papers;
digitally accessible documents, archives, and manuscript collections; and brick-and-mortar
archival collections. These range from Index Medicus to the African Online Digital Library and
from the records of the U.S. CDC to the archives of the WHO."
10766845,"Vitamin B12 (or cobalamin) supports just two enzymes in the human proteome, but its absence is incompatible
with life. This high value dietary commodity is escorted by an elaborate system of chaperones to its two client
enzymes: methionine synthase (MS) in the cytoplasm and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) in the
mitochondrion. Clues to the complexity and multicompartment geography of the B12 trafficking pathway had
emerged from clinical genetics studies on patients with inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism, which led to their
classification into nine complementation groups (cblA-G, cblJ and mut). Immodest in size, translocation of this
portly and complex organometallic cofactor, complete with a tail that is absent in other tetrapyrroles, presents
challenges, both chemical and steric. With the discovery of the disease-associated cbl genes, the PI’s group has
led the effort to decipher function, illuminating structural, spectroscopic, and kinetic details of the elegant redox-
linked coordination chemistry that is integral to the trafficking pathway. Exciting advances in the past cycle
combined with a wealth of provocative leads, position us to address major gaps in our understanding of B12
trafficking, which are fundamentally important and clinically relevant to isolated homocystinuria (due to a
functional deficiency of MS) or methylmalonic aciduria (due to a functional deficiency of MCM) or both (due to
mutations in the early steps in the trafficking pathway). Clinical data on patient mutations in the cbl and mut
(MCM) genes, will continue to be integrated into our studies as we address the following specific aims in the next
cycle. (i) Elucidate the mechanism by which chaperones in the shared cytoplasmic pathway direct B12 traffic at
a branchpoint. Specifically, we will test our hypothesis that alternative interprotein Co-S complexes between
CblC, a chemically versatile b-ligand transferase/eliminase, and CblD, which we discovered has two B12 bindings
sites, govern partitioning between the cytoplasmic versus mitochondrial branches. We will also test the intriguing
hypothesis that B12 piggybacks on CblD to enter the mitochondrion. (ii) Elucidate the mechanism of B12 transfer
in the cytoplasmic branch from CblD to MS following our discovery that vicinal thiols are important for B12 delivery.
We hypothesize that B12 tethered via a Co-S bond to CblD is loaded onto MS, and that the complex is freed via
displacement of the thiolate ligand to form holo-MS and an intramolecular disulfide on CblD. (iii) Elucidate the
molecular traffic lights in the mitochondrial branch that permit 5´-deoxyadenosylcobalamin loading from ATR
(adenosyltransferase) to MCM and cob(II)alamin off-loading from MCM to ATR (for repair) in the presence of the
G-protein chaperone, CblA. We will also assess the potential for rhodibalamin to form a rhodium-carbon bond
(catalyzed by ATR) but resist its cleavage (by MCM). A small gene cluster, including ATR and MCM is essential
for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) survival across a wide range of growth and stress conditions. We will test
our hypothesis that rhodibalamins and other antivitamin B12 derivatives will target this metabolic vulnerability and
inhibit Mtb growth."
10746836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Efficacy of CAR T cell therapies against solid tumors has been limited by a lack of expansion in vivo, low levels
of tumor trafficking, poor functionality/persistence and by suppression in the tumor micro-environment (TME).
Conventionally prepared CAR T cells are unable to retain sufficient differentiational plasticity to undergo natural
pathways of T cell proliferation/differentiation/persistence in vivo for sustained, effective cytotoxic anti-tumor
activity. Oncolytic viruses (OV) selectively replicate in tumor cells to generate a highly inflammatory TME
which may enhance CAR T cell recruitment to, and function within, solid tumors. Our goal is to develop a novel
regimen by which oncolytic virotherapy can be used as a potent immunological adjuvant to improve the
efficacy of CAR T cell therapy against solid tumors.
By loading the OV on the CAR T cells ex vivo, we achieved highly significant improvements in tumor therapy
compared to virus or CAR T cells alone. Mice treated with completely systemically delivered CAR T and VSV
developed a population of CD8+ CAR T cells with T Cell Receptor (TCR) specificity for the immunodominant
H2Kb VSV N52-59 epitope of VSV which selectively expanded in vivo to very high frequency. This population of
dual-specific (DS) (virus-specific and CAR T antigen-specific) memory-like (TM) CAR T cells 1). persisted in
mice for much longer than conventional CAR T, 2). was significantly more functional against tumor, and 3).
could be rapidly re-activated in vivo against tumor by a secondary systemic boost with homologous virus,
resulting in long-term tumor cures. These therapeutic effects were observed with two different OV (VSV and
reovirus) and across tumor sites (subcutaneous and intra-cranial). Therefore, here we propose a completely
novel approach to expand the scope of CAR T cell therapy against solid tumors in which dual specific CAR T
cells with improved activity against tumors are generated by using co-administered OV to induce a
recapitulation of the physiological pathways that lead to optimal (CAR) T cell activation, proliferation and
differentiation in vivo in response to virus infection.
We have formulated three Specific Aims: 1) To define the molecular mechanisms by which TCR engagement
of DS CAR T cells determines their phenotype, improved persistence and function; 2) To generate in vivo
expanded populations of DS CAR T cells with TCR specificity against either tumor associated, or viral recall,
antigens and to determine their therapeutic activity against established tumors; 3) To optimize in vivo
expansion, persistence/longevity and re-activation of DS CAR T cells through novel boost and rest strategies
targeting either the TCR, CAR or both. This will lead to implementation of fully systemic protocols for the
combination of CAR T cells with OV which do not require any access to tumors."

Asthma affects boys more than girls, but gender-switch occurs after puberty and asthma is more common in
women than men. This research proposal investigates the effect of sex and sex hormones on asthma severity.
The long-term goal of our studies is to identify sex related differences in genetic risks and biological pathways of
severe asthma. Our analyses of well characterized asthma cohorts and large databases reveal that severe
asthma exhibits a bimodal peak in young boys and middle age women [3], which pointes to sex hormones in
mechanisms of asthma severity. Preliminary data of sex hormone levels from women enrolled in SARP 1-3
(2001-2018) showed that FEV1 (%) correlated negatively with estradiol, but positively with progesterone.
Additionally, the adrenal androgen dehydro-epiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) correlated positively with FEV1
(%) in women and men, but testosterone levels correlated with FEV1 (%) in men but not in women. Our data also
suggest that sex hormones modulate airway inflammation through their effect on sex steroids receptors (SSRs).
Gene expression data from bronchial epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopy from 128 SARP 3 participants
with asthma revealed significant correlation between estrogen receptors 1 and 2 (ESR1 and ESR2) gene
expression and inflammatory cytokine receptors (IL6R, IL4R, IL5RA, and IL13RA1) gene expression. Our
preliminary analyses of SARP1-2 BEC microarray data (n= 72 women, 32 men) showed sex-specific differential-
targeting of groups of interacting genes representing particular biological functions (mitochondrial function in
women and interferon signaling in men). These data suggest that sex and sex hormones play an important role
in the clinical manifestations of asthma genetic risk variants. Based on these cumulative findings, we hypothesize
that sex and sex hormones influence immune system activation and airway inflammation to drive asthma
phenotypes and progression differentially in males and females across the lifespan. In aim 1 we evaluate how
sex hormone serum concentrations and SSRs expression in blood, upper, and lower airway cells determine T2
inflammation and asthma severity in men and women. In aim 2 we identify the sex-specific genetic effects of loci
across the genome on asthma risk and severity resulting from DNA variant interactions with hormone and nuclear
receptor expression. In aim 3, we will assess whether sexual dimorphism of asthma is related to a higher order
of gene interactions and variation in sex-specific configurations in gene regulatory networks. The proposed
studies have the potential to define key hormonal and genomic drivers of asthma risk and severity over the
lifespan in men and women and address a large knowledge gap of how sex and sex hormones modify asthma
risk and severity. Future studies will aim, using this data, to identify personalized, hormone-based risk
stratification and treatment approaches in men and women, irrespective of background ancestry."

 Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) produces an early systemic inflammatory response associated with
significant neurological injury and mortality. Unlike sepsis, OHCA offers an opportunity to intervene at the
earliest stages of the immune response. However, the immunology of cardiac arrest is understudied. To
address this, we started the multi-center Immunology of Cardiac Arrest Network (I-CAN), a collaboration
applying single-cell approaches to a unique biobank of cryopreserved, viable peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) from OHCA patients. Our premise is that cardiac arrest triggers endogenous, compensatory
mechanisms that promote the resolution of inflammation, limit injury and improve survival. Our preliminary
studies identified that monocyte and NK cell states expressing immune checkpoints were expanded in patients
with poor neurological outcomes. Interactome analysis identified cytokines (IFNγ, IL-10) that mediate cross-talk
between Nectin-2+ monocytes and Tim-3+ TIGIT+ NK cells. Subsequent ex vivo studies on PBMC from OHCA
patients demonstrated that Nectin-2 is a brake on production of IFNγ by NK cells. IFNγ-deficient mice in
experimental cardiac arrest and resuscitation had reduced neurological injury and mortality. These findings
suggest our hypothesis that Nectin-2 monocytes are a protective response to ameliorate inflammation and
neurological injury after OHCA. Here, we propose to define the mechanisms that resolve inflammation after
cardiac arrest. In Aim 1, we perform deep immunophenotyping of OHCA patients at single-cell resolution. In
Aim 2, we define the immune checkpoint profile of OHCA and its association with neurological outcomes. We
then define the function of immune checkpoints in OHCA, with a focus on Nectin-2+ monocytes. In Aim 3, we
test targeting of immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy in a mouse model of cardiac arrest and
resuscitation. Together, these aims define a new therapeutic approach: augmentation of endogenous,
protective mechanisms to reduce inflammation after cardiac arrest. Further, our multi-center and multi-
disciplinary team in the Immunology of Cardiac Arrest Network (I-CAN) establishes the resource of a two-site
biorepository of clinical cardiac arrest with deep immunophenotyping of the subjects."
10757728,"Project Summary:
Bacterial cells have a repertoire of responses that can be used to survive under different types of
environmental stress. Changes in carbon sources cause cells to turn on specific metabolic genes, which are
later repressed when those sources are depleted. Antibiotic exposure can trigger the expression of molecular
pumps that remove the antibiotic from the cell, or the production of enzymes that specifically inactivate or
degrade it. In a continually fluctuating environment, the process of turning genes on and off can be inefficient
and cause growth lags. Our work shows that bacteria combine their responses with phenotypic memory – the
passage of stable proteins from mother to daughter cells – which allows cells to avoid growth lags in fluctuating
environments.
Using a combination of quantitative microbiology, microfluidics, microscopy, sequencing, and modeling, we will
study the costs and benefits of gene regulation in fluctuating environments. We will measure and model the
fitness landscape of phenotypic memory using a library of strains with perturbed memory levels. Competition
experiments in fluctuating environments will be used to test biophysical and population dynamics models.
We present an innovative modular system that enables direct comparison of different gene regulatory
strategies – including responsive, bistable, and constitutive regulation – for any gene of interest. We apply the
system to study different classes of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. The proposed experiments make use of
a custom-built microfluidic ‘chemoflux’ system that we developed, in which bacterial populations grow in
monolayers, tracked at single cell resolution under the microscope, while the growth media can be arbitrarily
fluctuated in time. Using the chemoflux and our image analysis algorithms, we are able to simultaneously track
hundreds of independent bacterial populations, and thereby measure population dynamics in fluctuating
environments.
We combine experiments with biophysical modeling to gain insights into the costs and benefits of gene
regulation and memory. Models are parameterized using experimental data in a wide range of conditions, and
rigorously tested by their predictions on competition experiments in fluctuating environments. The range of
experiments and modeling employed address different aspects of gene regulation and memory, and allows us
to bridge from detailed laboratory measurements to the general biological principles that underlie bacterial
survival."
10917032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Radiation (RT) therapy remains a mainstay in the treatment of women with breast cancer (BC), but locoregional
disease recurrence remains a significant clinical issue that compromises survival, with locoregional recurrence
rates ~20-25% at 10 years in women with >3 lymph nodes (LNs) ER+ BC or TNBC. As over 280,000 women are
diagnosed with breast cancer in the US each year and 37% have N+ breast cancer at diagnosis, this population
includes >100,000 women in the US each year who have either >3 LN or have TNBC each year. A 25% risk of
recurrence in this number of potentially curable women represents a greater mortality risk than many other
cancers and underscores the potential impact of these studies. Evaluation of clinical agents that function as
radiosensitizers is an area of active yet understudied interest. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK
4/6i) are used as frontline therapy to treat women with metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast
cancers and ongoing studies continue to refine their utility in the upfront, non-metastatic setting for women with
high-risk ER+ breast cancers. Despite these promising studies, CDK4/6 inhibitors are not yet given in
combination with the radiation therapy that patients receive as part of the standard of care, and there currently
is no indication for women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) which disproportionately affects African
American women.
We previously showed that CDK4/6 inhibition leads to the radiosensitization of multiple Rb-intact ER+ breast
cancer cell lines as well as TNBC models. This radiosensitization occurs to a similar degree with palbociclib,
ribociclib, and abemaciclib, the three clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our data suggests a novel
association between CDK 4/6 inhibition and the DNA damage response. Indeed, we have demonstrated that
short term CDK4/6 inhibition leads to a decrease in expression of DNA repair proteins like CHK1 and RAD51
that play a role in homologous recombination and leads to radiosensitization in ER+ breast cancer models. This
has not, however, ever been demonstrated in TNBC. Although we have demonstrated that all three CDK4/6
inhibitors lead to the radiosensitization of ER+, the mechanism of this radiosensitization remains unclear as does
the utility of this approach in women with TNBC. We hypothesize that women with locally advanced multiple
node positive Rb intact breast cancer (including most ER+ and up to 70% of TNBC) will benefit from combination
treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor with radiation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the combination of CDK 4/6i
with RT is safe, tolerable, and effective in women at high risk of local recurrence of BC.
In this proposal, we will 1) determine the mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitor-mediated radiosensitization in ER+ and
TNBC models; 2) determine the sequencing and efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor-mediated radiosensitization in in
vivo models of ER+ and TNBC and 3) determine the safety and efficacy of this combination approach in women
with locally advanced ER+ and TNBC in a phase I clinical trial."
10753576,"SUMMARY
Slow flow vascular malformations, including lymphatic malformations (LMs) and venous malformations
(VMs), have been shown to be caused by somatic mutations in genes that hyperactivate the PI3K/mTOR or
RAS signaling. LM/VM patients have severe morbidities and even mortality, and there are no FDA-approved
treatments. Current therapies provide partial response and are non-curative. There is an urgent need to
identify effective, biologically targeted therapeutics. We have discovered protein homeostasis dysfunction in
pathogenic endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from LMs (LMECs) and VMs (VMECs). We demonstrate that this
dysfunction is downstream of PI3K/mTOR hyperactivation, which results in increased VECADHERIN and
CD31 synthesis, cytoplasmic accumulation, and decreased expression at the cell surface. We proposed that
the excess of VECADHERIN/CD31 in the cytoplasm overwhelms the proteasome and lysosomal degradation
pathways, which in turn perturbs VECADHERIN/CD31 functions essential to the quiescent blood and
lymphatic vasculature. Supporting this hypothesis, we identified a novel class of drugs, proteasome inhibitors
(PIs) that inhibit proteasome degradation and preferentially target cells with protein homeostasis defects as
more efficacious at suppressing LMEC/VMECs growth when compared to currently used therapies. We
hypothesize that PI3K hyperactivation induces protein homeostasis defects that contribute to LM/VM
pathology and that targeting this dysfunction serves as a new avenue of therapeutic intervention. In Aim 1,
we will determine the mechanism by which PIs suppress abnormal LM and VM growth using patient derived
LMEC/VMECs with PI3K and/or RAS pathway hyperactivation. Transgenic mouse models that express either
PIK3CAH1047 or KRASG12D using EC and LEC specific drivers will be used to assess the efficacy of 2 PIs,
oprozomib and bortezomib, with a goal of prioritizing which PI can be repurposed for the treatment of LMs
and VMs. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of protein homeostasis dysfunction in VM/LM pathobiology.
Primary human ECs that overexpress pathogenic PIK3CA or KRAS variants and patient ECs will be used to
understand the consequences and mechanisms by which increased VECADHERIN and CD31 expression
and cytoplasmic accumulation overwhelms proteasome and lysosomal degradation pathways. We will also
determine if drugs that improve protein degradation can normalize LMEC/VMEC pathology. The goal is to
better understand how common pathogenic variants in LM/VMs contribute to their pathogenesis and
determine if therapeutics that target protein degradation defects can be repurposed for LM/VM patients."
10754562,"All epithelial cells are interconnected through three major types of junctions – Tight Junctions (TJs), Adherens
Junctions (AJs), and Desmosomes (DSMs). In simple epithelia, these junctions are positioned along the apical
end of the cell lateral membrane, where they form the Apical Junctional Complex (AJC). AJs and DSMs, but
not TJs, are also present along the basolateral plasma membrane, where they are much smaller in size. This
asymmetry of junction organization is a distinctive architectural feature of simple epithelia. Such asymmetry is
controlled by a set of conserved polarity proteins. The main question that we set out to address in this proposal
is: how are two polarity proteins, basolateral protein Scrib and apical protein Par3, interconnected with proteins
regulating the positioning of the cell-cell junctions in AJC.
Our recently published results suggested how Scrib maintains “basolateral identity” of simple epithelial cell
membrane, the mechanism that has been elusive for many years. We found that this function of Scrib is based
on regulation of two enzymes, phosphatase PP1 (PP1) and Rho/Rac Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor,
GEF-H1. Our results suggest that Scrib holds PP1 in inactive state and releases it in an active form through
interactions with other polarity proteins, Llgl, Dlg, and Band 4.1. We also show that a protein that links the
polarity apparatus with DSM assembly is an ARM protein, plakophilin 3 (Pkp3). We provide evidence that this
protein is stored around TJs in a “dormant” pool that is established under control of the apical polarity protein
Par3. The active form of Pkp3, released from this pool, drives formation of DSMs using the mechanism that is
radically distinct from the assembly mechanism of the evolutionary related junctions, AJs. Furthermore, we
present some evidence suggesting that a similar Pkp-dependent mechanism of junction assembly is involved
in formation of a previously unrecognized subtype of AJs, which we call here Pkp4-dependent AJs. The
advances made in previous years allow us to come up with this proposal, which includes the investigation of:
(i) how Scrib regulates PP1 and what are the effectors of this pathway; (ii) how Pkp3 regulates adhesion
activity of desmosomal cadherins and how its DSM assembly activity is regulated by the polarity system; and
(iii) how Pkp4 controls adhesion activity of classic cadherins in assembly of specific subset of AJs. This work
will pave the way toward the development of reagents modulating the adhesive and barrier properties of
epithelial tissues."
10915398,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) adapt to local conditions, maximizing their potential to perpetuate and
emerge as health threats. The adaptive potential of arboviruses is driven by error-prone replication, which
creates a genetically diverse pool of competing virus genotypes within each host. One of the most important
ways that the environment is changing is that temperatures are rising. This proposal examines some of the
ways that temperature may impact arbovirus evolutionary biology.
Aim 1 will address how a comprehensive temperature gradient that includes both constant and fluctuating
temperatures with varying means and amplitudes alters natural selection on WNV populations within
mosquitoes and the strength of bottlenecks. Our predictions are that fluctuating temperatures will increase the
strength of purifying selection, that diversity will be maximized at optimal constant temperatures, and that
bottlenecks will become wider as temperature increases. Flaviviruses infections are most frequently initiated by
aggregates of virus particles. Aim 2 will address the extent that this occurs in a host- and temperature-
dependent manner, bringing our previous work into a more ecologically relevant, realistic context. In the
second phase of Aim 2, we will ask whether these genome aggregates can help to facilitate the maintenance
of genetic diversity in the WNV population. This is important because population bottlenecks can significantly
impact virus fitness, and aggregation of genomes in individual infections may help viruses escape from them.
We have found that birds that generate high WNV viremia and are highly infectious to mosquitoes (crows)
have significantly more unique WNV genomes per cell than those that have lower viremias (robins). Aim 3 will
assess whether this also may occur in mosquitoes. We also will assess the degree to which this phenomenon
may allow for the maintenance of low fitness viral genotypes while preventing those of high fitness from gaining
dominance. Preliminary data supporting the feasibility of these studies is provided in the application.
The significance of this work is that it will provide novel, comprehensive data on the ways that changing
environmental conditions such as those that we are now experiencing may alter the fundamental population
biology of arboviruses. Arboviruses are uniquely susceptible to these conditions because they must replicate in
mosquitoes. This is inherently significant. Our work is also significant because it will provide mechanistic data
on how viruses may maintain genetic diversity in the face of both selective and stochastic reductions in genetic
diversity. Finally, the significance of our work is that we have provided technical and analytical tools that are
broadly useful and have permitted us to collaborate effectively with a wide array of investigators. The proposed
studies are technically and conceptually innovative because of the ways that we can combine realistic
transmission systems in the lab with barcoded viruses, single cell approaches, and other new molecular tools."
10898571,"The overarching goal of this project is to obtain a deep, molecular-level understanding of P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-
mediated drug transport and efflux inhibition. Pgp belongs to a very important class of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters that transport substrates out of cells using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. One of the truly
remarkable features of Pgp is its unusually broad polyspecificity. Pgp functions like a hydrophobic vacuum
cleaner, transporting diverse molecules including many clinically useful drugs that partition into the lipid bilayer.
Pgp is known to be a key determinant of the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of drugs in
humans. Pgp also causes cellular multidrug resistance, hindering the treatment of many diseases. Because of
the potential adverse effects of Pgp efflux on drugs, the US Food and Drug Administration mandates
documentation of drug interactions with Pgp for approval of any new drug. Evasion or inhibition of Pgp without
compromising therapeutic efficacy has been a major goal of the pharmaceutical industry, which, however, is
seriously hindered by the lack in the fundamental understanding of the polyspecific Pgp-drug interactions. Our
long-term goal in studying Pgp/drug interactions is to facilitate the development and discovery of new drugs that
either inhibit or evade Pgp efflux. Towards this end, we propose three independent but related specific aim
studies for this project, with each addressing a key question closely related to drug development. In Aim 1, we
will discover bona fide Pgp antagonists for mechanistic studies. We note that many widely studied Pgp inhibitors
compete with drugs for Pgp transport. We envision the discovery of novel, nonsubstrate Pgp antagonists
displaying distinct properties from the known inhibitors, which is crucial to Pgp inhibition mechanistic studies and
for the development of better drugs to inhibit Pgp. In Aim 2, we will interrogate how Pgp discriminates transport
substrates and inhibitors. We have formulated a novel hypothesis that the two halves of Pgp may play different
roles in Pgp transport and inhibition, based on several preliminary studies. We will further investigate this
hypothesis by covalently attaching ligands to different binding sites in Pgp and then characterizing Pgp structure
and activity to find correlations. In Aim 3, we propose to rationalize chemical strategies to modify drugs to evade
Pgp transport. We will carry out systematic chemical modifications on specific ligands for Pgp structural and
activity relationship studies to learn the basic chemical principles underlying Pgp-drug interactions. Our aim
studies for Pgp incorporate novel chemical designs complemented by in-depth activity and structural studies.
We have collected strong preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility and novelty of each Aim study. Our
approach is quite unique and will offer unprecedented insights into the complex interactions of drugs with Pgp,
thus having a significant impact on drug discovery."
10837904,"MPS I, historically known as Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes depending upon degree of central
nervous system (CNS) involvement and velocity of disease progression, is a deficiency of the α-L-iduronidase
(IDUA) enzyme resulting in pansystemic storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). While Hurler syndrome,
which represents the most severe degree of IDUA deficiency and symptomatology, presents in the first year of
life with neurodevelopmental stagnation and subsequent regression, the other forms of MPS I also experience
CNS involvement with dural hyperplasia, spinal canal stenosis, and myelopathy. All forms of MPS I manifest
painful, degenerative joint disease caused by synovial hypertrophy and inflammation, and abnormalities of
chondrocyte proliferation and matrix synthesis. Other MPS I symptoms include hepatosplenomegaly,
cardiomyopathy, valve dysplasia, and aortic root dilatation. Treatments for MPS I, either stem cell transplant
(SCT) or intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human IDUA, reduce disease
burden and extend life expectancy of MPS I patients, but represent incomplete therapies. SCT poses
significant risks of immunocompromise, graft-versus-host disease, incomplete engraftment, or death. ERT
must be administered repeatedly for the patient’s entire lifetime and does not cross the blood-brain barrier,
rendering it incapable of treating CNS disease. SCT-treated Hurler patients, even with full hematopoietic
engraftment and normal blood IDUA levels, suffer significant cognitive deficits and require rehabilitative
services. Neither SCT nor ERT ameliorate joint contractures and osteoarthritis, leaving patients with daily pain,
immobility, and reduced quality of life. Therefore, there is a clear necessity to develop a single-session therapy
for MPS I which safely, durably, and fully restores IDUA levels throughout the body especially the CNS and
joints, to correct symptoms in multiple key affected tissues. This necessity takes on additional urgency as
increasingly, MPS I is identified in the neonatal period through newborn screening, presenting an opportunity to
provide early treatment and prevent onset of symptoms throughout all organ systems. This study utilizes the
canine MPS I model to evaluate a multimodal gene therapy approach, simultaneously treating with
combinations of intracisternal, intra-articular, and intravenous adeno-associated virus vector carrying copies of
the normal canine IDUA gene. Aim 1 of this proposal will study the ability of this novel approach to safely
generate CNS expression of IDUA enzyme, eliminate GAG storage, and translate to improvement of
abnormalities in brain imaging and cognitive function. Aim 2 of this proposal will evaluate for expression of
IDUA enzyme, clearance of GAG storage in joint synovium and cartilage, and improvement of joint
morphology, reduction of inflammation, and normalization of ligamentous strength. Enzyme expression,
substrate reduction, and pathology will also be assessed in hepatic and cardiac tissues. This study will
generate essential key data informing subsequent clinical trials of multimodal gene replacement therapy in
human MPS I, addressing the unmet need faced by affected patients."
10761776,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Disorders belong to a devastating class of
neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies, marked by pathologic aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated tau
protein (phospho-tau)1. An early event in the onset of tauopathies is the formation of pathologic-stress granules
(p-SGs); cytotoxic biomolecular condensates (BMCs) consisting of toxic phospho-tau oligomers and RNA-
binding proteins (RBPs) T-Cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA1) and Splicing Factor Proline and Glutamine Rich
(SFPQ) that accumulate in the cytoplasm of neural cells2–4,8. While it is evident that p-SGs play an important role
in the pathogenesis of tauopathy2,3,5,75, it is unknown how they form and how they impact homeostatic functions
of the proteins they sequester. Defects in axonal transport have been established as an early event
accompanying phospho-tau pathology, with conformational changes in pathologic tau leading to inhibition of
anterograde axonal transport through kinesin motors32–34. Since several SG associated RBPs, including SFPQ,
rely on kinesins to transport mRNAs9,10, we propose that early deficits in axonal transport lead to buildup of
transport RBPs in the cytoplasm, where they aggregate, contributing to formation of p-SGs. Once sequestered
in p-SGs, we predict that RBP homeostatic functions are disrupted, enhancing tau-mediated neurodegeneration.
To test our model, we will use innovative methods for interrupting axonal transport in WT and P301S MAPT
mutant human induced cortical neurons (iCNs) and motor neurons (iMNs). We will evaluate whether disruption
of particular transport programs accelerates formation of the BMCs that are the p-SGs. To determine whether
sequestration of RBP SFPQ in p-SGs disrupts critical homeostatic functions in the nucleus and/or the axons of
cortical and motor neurons, we will again use WT and P301S MAPT mutant human induced cortical neurons
(iCNs) and motor neurons (iMNs) and interrogate the multiple essential functions of SFPQ57, including DNA
repair, nuclear mRNA export, and axonal mRNA transport. Results from these studies will identify early targets
for pharmacologic intervention in the pathogenesis of tauopathy and identify essential differences in the onset of
disease in different cells types of the central nervous system."
10843045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching theme for our research program over the past 10 years has been to better understand the
etiology and pathogenesis of chronic inflammation in tissue repair processes and vascular disease, with a
particular interest in how epigenetics influences the innate immune response and shapes pathologic and
homeostatic processes. Our laboratory has contributed seminal studies related to 1) epigenetic regulation of
myeloid cells that alter inflammation in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), 2) regulation of macrophage
phenotypes by chromatin modifying enzymes (CMEs) during tissue repair, 3) prostaglandin regulation of
macrophage plasticity in the setting of tissue repair, 4) chemokines and other signaling pathways driving
monocyte recruitment to injured tissue and tissue macrophage phenotypes, 5) epigenetic alterations that
impact macrophage function in COVID-19 infection, 6) metabolomic and other biomarker studies in tissue
regeneration and cardiovascular disease, 7) role of epigenetic regulation of macrophages following recovery
from sepsis. Our work has utilized animal models to carry out mechanistic studies and patient-derived cells and
tissues to confirm relevant pathways, identify therapeutic targets and characterize novel biomarkers. Based on
our previously published observations and novel preliminary data, our laboratory is broadly focused in 4 main
areas. The first serves as a continuation and expansion of HL156274 grant (currently in year 2) to complete
and advance therapeutically relevant studies of JMJD3 and other critical CMEs in AAA development. The
second goal will serve as renewal of HL137919 and allow us explore JAK/STAT signaling in tissue
macrophages and blood monocytes and the downstream regulation of CMEs and subsequent inflammation in
a variety of conditions (tissue regeneration, AAAs and post-sepsis recovery). The third goal will be to explore
the interactions between structural cells (SMCs, keratinocytes, fibroblasts) and myeloid cells in the setting of
tissue regeneration and AAA development. The fourth will be an expansion into the area of peripheral
atherosclerosis where we will explore epigenetic regulation of macrophage phenotype/function in the setting of
peripheral atherosclerotic disease (PAD). This emerging investigator award (EIA) mechanism will allow us to
extend our studies in each of these areas and will allow for mechanistic understanding of the role of epigenetic
regulation of macrophage phenotypes in the pathogenesis of a breadth of cardiovascular disease processes
including tissue regeneration, aneurysm formation and peripheral atherosclerosis. It will also allow our
laboratory to complete proof-of-concept and validation studies needed in both animals and humans to advance
new therapies to the clinics for treatment of cardiovascular diseases."
10757958,"Understanding the social, economic, behavioral, and institutional factors that drive place-based differences in
mid-life morbidity and mortality is critical to addressing health inequalities. Historic racist housing policies (e.g.,
federal redlining, restrictive deeds and covenants) influenced the physical, social and economic structure of
places resulting in racial and socioeconomic residential segregation in the US. The systemic denial of
homeownership opportunities through racist housing policies may be a key upstream source of mid-life health
inequities observed across the US today through restrictions wealth and place-based investment over time.
Our previous work has shown that Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining from 1935-40 is
associated with high minority, low socioeconomic neighborhoods with shorter average life expectancy, higher
neighborhood prevalence of chronic diseases, and worse physical and mental health. However, few studies
have investigated the mechanisms by which historic redlining, subsequent neighborhood trajectories of
investment and disinvestment, and racial residential segregation over time have shaped place-based
inequalities in `exposure' to harmful environments (e.g., industrial toxins) and `access' to health promoting
resources (e.g., health care services) that impact individual-level morbidity and mortality.
The proposed project will address this gap by, first, harmonizing siloed data sources to produce a national
database of historical redlining, historic and current environmental hazards, housing investment, gentrification,
and longitudinal neighborhood demographics and socioeconomics. Then, we will examine structural racism as
it is embedded in neighborhoods with 1) the resulting inequalities in neighborhood `access and exposure' that
drive health opportunities (Aim 2), and 2) disparities in morbidity and mortality risk beginning in mid-life in a
nationally representative longitudinal study, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (Aim 3). We hypothesize
that historically redlined areas will have greater proximity to present-day environmental hazards and reduced
access to healthcare and health promoting resources, and that longitudinal neighborhood change associated
with redlining will partially mediate these associations. We further hypothesize that HRS participants living in
historically redlined areas will have greater risk of morbidity and mortality than HRS participants not living in
redlined areas and that this association will vary by present-day intensity of racial residential segregation. This
project will create actionable knowledge to address health inequities beginning in mid-life by uncovering how
macrostructural factors, including historic, racist government policies result neighborhood and individual health
disparities. Further, the data product generated in Aim 1 will be made publicly available to facilitate additional
research on the impact of place in other longitudinal studies of health."
10832707,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Decades of animal models have taught us that addiction is, indeed, a disorder of dysregulated neural circuits.
However, there are currently no circuit-based biomarkers or treatments for human patients. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) has the potential to radically transform how substance use disorders (SUDs) are
treated. Presently, multiple sessions of 10-Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) passively applied over the left dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 20 to 30 min (2000–3000 pulses) has recently been adopted for the treatment of
nicotine use disorder (NUD), particularly reducing craving and cigarette consumption. It has been suggested that
the observed modulation of the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry by 10-Hz prefrontal rTMS might mediate the
therapeutic effects of TMS in NUD and other substance-related disorders. However, in clinical practices, a half-
hour TMS therapy 5 days a week could take weeks to be fully effective, and its therapeutic efficacy remains
limited and varies greatly across individuals. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to develop a faster and
more concentrated TMS protocol that may reduce the treatment time length and increase its clinical efficiency
by more precisely identifying and actively targeting the reward circuitry and proximal functions. Building on recent
advances in combining TMS with EEG, which allow TMS protocols to be directly controlled by the EEG signal
(closed-loop modulation), we aim to test a novel close-loop TMS intervention capable of real-time tracking and
modulation of distinct episodes of reward-related midcingulate cortex (MCC) activity in nicotine-dependent
individuals. This approach potentially offers bidirectional treatments that are spatially, temporally, and cognitively
precise. Our lab and others have identified oscillatory EEG signals in the theta band over frontal sites (frontal
midline theta, FMT) that accompany dopaminergic reward prediction errors, and that are altered in NUD and
other substance use disorders. Since the phase of oscillations in the EEG can reflect local processing, the timing
of TMS pulses to precise periods during these rhythms should have direct neural, behavioral, and computational
effects, and thereby improved clinical outcomes. Thus, we have developed a novel closed-loop system capable
of tracking these theta oscillations in real-time and using that information to control delivery of TMS. This proposal
seeks to test the neural, computational, behavioral efficacy of these protocols for modulating MCC reward
function (Aim 1), and then test whether precisely triggering TMS synchronized with the peak or trough of FMT
oscillations would temporarily reduce the subjective craving triggered by exposure to smoking cues in nicotine-
dependent adult smokers (Aim 2). This project is innovative because it enables the possibility to instantaneously
probe the MCC neural response pattern and to deliver TMS manipulations as they occur during reward-directed
behavior. The proposed research is significant, because the scientific knowledge will provide best practices to
choose stimulation parameters that will advance the treatment for particular neurocognitive processes involved
in both NUD and other substance-related disorders."
10761780,"Project Summary
The spatial organization of cells and molecules in biological tissues plays a critical role in pathophysiology. For
example, spatial heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment determines tumor initiation, metastasis, and drug
response. Despite advances in spatial transcriptomics to map RNA in tissues, it is proteins, rather than RNA,
that drive most cellular processes and determine disease state. As protein abundance cannot be inferred
precisely from transcriptomic data, it is important to measure protein abundance and their spatial distribution to
better predict pathophysiological phenomena, as well as to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
 Previous work on spatial proteomics is based on antibody recognition, mass spectrometry imaging, or
physical dissection of the tissue followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Antibody-based and mass spectrometry imaging approaches have low proteome coverage (<100 proteins). The
only approach with deep coverage (>3000 proteins) is tissue dissection followed by LC-MS/MS. This method
leverages the power of state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS to achieve in-depth quantification of thousands of proteins
along with their post-translational modifications. However, this approach is limited by current dissection methods.
Manual dissection has low throughput and poor spatial resolution. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) has high
resolution, but the isolation of many pixels, required for tissue mapping, is tedious and suffers from sample loss.
 The goal of this project is to develop a high throughput and scalable technology to perform tissue
microdissection that preserves tissue spatial information and couples directly to established LC-MS/MS workflow
for deep and unbiased spatial mapping of the proteome. We will demonstrate our technology on tumor slices of
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Our approach integrates a novel tissue micro-dicing device (“µDicer”), a
nanodroplet sample preparation platform (“nanoPOTS”) for LC-MS/MS analysis with single-cell sensitivity, and
a microfluidic device (“µMapper”) to transfer the diced tissue pixels from the µDicer to the nanoPOTS array while
preserving their spatial order. Our approach is innovative because no technology currently exists to perform
tissue micro-dissection and their transfer to macroscopic wells in parallel for LC-MS/MS while preserving spatial
information. The specific aims are to optimize the µDicer for dicing fixed tissue slices into 10-100 µm micro-tissue
pixels, develop and validate the µMapper to transfer tissue pixels from the µDicer onto nanoPOTS chips, and
develop a high throughput and integrated spatial proteomics workflow and apply it to map human tumor slices.
The project is significant because it will accelerate mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, thereby
advancing our understanding of the role of tissue heterogeneity in pathophysiology, such as the role of the tumor
microenvironment on cancer progression, and will enable the identification of novel protein biomarkers and
therapeutic targets to facilitate the early detection, diagnosis, and intervention of diseases."
10793642,"In clinical studies, the time-to-event outcomes are widely used to evaluate a new treatment
efficacy. When complete randomization is not possible or successful the Cox proportional
hazards model can be used to adjust for the confounding effects and to increase statistical
power. Phase II studies usually have relatively small number, so the survival analysis results are
not very reliable or do not have enough power to detect a positive result of the experimental
treatment. This project aims to provide better survival analysis results compared to existing
methods for small sample studies. Sieve method has becoming a popular approach in
survival analysis, we propose to use the sieve maximum likelihood estimations to improve
survival analysis results for small studies and provide corresponding computing tools for
public use."

 The primary interventional treatment for ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD) is percutaneous
intervention (PCI) involving angioplasty and deployment of a vascular stent. Clinical trials have shown that
fractional flow reserve (FFR), which is assessed by taking the ratio of pressure distal to the stenosis divided by
pressure proximal to the stenosis, reduces the number of adverse cardiac events compared to the use of
angiographic-based anatomical criteria alone. Despite its benefit, invasive measurement of FFR is not widely
used due to its high expense and procedural complexity.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) offers a method
for determining FFR non-invasively and without ionizing radiation. MRI can be used for coronary artery imaging,
can measure coronary flow, is non-invasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. Therefore, our first objective is
to develop, validate, and test a cardiac MRI-based method to determine coronary FFR (FFRMRI). We will team
with the Siemens Healthineers MRI collaboration division to develop and test new image acquisition and
reconstruction methodology, and team with the Siemens Healthineers Medical Imaging Technology division to
develop image processing methods and display technology. The new paradigm will be tested in healthy controls
and in models studies, then applied to a group of subjects with stable CAD."

The overarching goal of this training award is to acquire the skills and experience necessary to become an
independent physician scientist with research expertise on fundamental mechanisms of bone marrow failure,
with a final goal of developing novel therapies. Maintaining genome integrity is an essential task for cells that
need to pass correct genetic information to their progeny. Cells are equipped with a variety of mechanisms to
protect their genome including robust DNA repair. Hematopoietic stem cells are especially vulnerable to DNA
damage and rely on Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway that removes DNA interstrand crosslinks. Patients
lacking the Fanconi anemia proteins invariably develop bone marrow failures. Unfortunately, there is no therapy
that prevents bone marrow failures in Fanconi anemia. While bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is thought
to be caused by the inappropriate repair of the DNA interstrand crosslinks, the source of that DNA damage is
poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated endogenous metabolic by-products, such as acetaldehyde
and formaldehyde, in acceleration of disease progression in Fanconi anemia. To identify other sources of DNA
damage, we have performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified a novel source of endogenous DNA damage
that needs Fanconi anemia pathway for its proper repair. In this application, we propose to validate our impactful
in vitro findings in the mouse hematopoietic stem cells using in vivo transplantation assays and genetically
modified mouse models. We will also assess the type of DNA damage and subsequent cellular consequences,
paying special attention to the genomic instability that is caused by this endogenous source of DNA damage.
We will also test whether any other protective pathways play a role in genome maintenance of hematopoietic
stem cells using an unbiased in vivo CRISPR screen approach. Knowledge gained through our studies may
unveil novel therapeutic targets useful for prevention of bone marrow failures in Fanconi anemia and in the
general population."
10751026,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
During the past decade, oropharyngeal cancer surpassed cervical cancer, becoming the most common cancer
caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Nearly 20,000 oropharyngeal cancer cases are diagnosed among men
and women in the United States annually. Despite favorable long-term survival, current non-targeted
cisplatin/radiation treatment protocols lead to significant treatment toxicities. De-escalating radiation doses with
alternative targeted therapies would be critical for limiting treatment-related toxicities and improving patient
quality of life. To address this, we propose to reduce the transcriptional output of viral genes and DNA damage
response (DDR) by reducing its dependence on a transcriptional co-regulator bromodomain protein, BRD4,
expressed in the oropharyngeal tissue. We propose that DDR deficiencies can be induced by second-generation
bromodomain-specific chemical inhibitors in HPV oropharyngeal tumors. This chemically induced DDR deficient
state delays the kinetics of DNA repair, thereby causing genomic instability. With tumors in this fragile state,
administering optimal radiation doses will result in genomic catastrophe leading to eradicating tumors. We
established that a first-generation inhibitor that targets both bromodomains BD1 and BD2 of BRD4 preferentially
reduced viral and DDR gene expression of a subset of HPV tumors, which harbored disrupted viral genomes
over non-disrupted viral genomes. However, pan-BD domain inhibition could give rise to pleiotropic effects. We
used second-generation domain-specific inhibitors introduced in 2020 on HPV tumor cell lines to refine the pan-
BD inhibition approach. We observed preferential domain-specific transcriptional regulation. While BD2 domain
inhibition downregulated DDR response in disrupted viral tumors, BD1 upregulated anti-viral gene expression in
non-disrupted viral tumors. These results guide us to postulate that patients selected upfront for disrupted viral
genomes can be matched for BD domain-specific inhibitor and de-escalated radiation treatments. We will use in
vitro and in vivo approaches to address a) efficacy of BD domain-specific inhibitors towards creating a DDR-
deficient state by measuring viral gene expression and quantifying DDR response kinetics, and test its on-target
efficacy in BRD4 knockdown and BD1 and BD2 domain-specific deleted tumor cells, b) Optimize the dose of
radiation sufficiently to preserve the efficacy of BD domain-specific inhibition in patient-derived xenograft mice
models with secondary endpoint analyses of survival, tumor volume growth, apoptosis, complete blood count
panel for toxicity and immunohistochemistry for proliferation and DNA repair proteins."
10762987,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) comprises the majority of preterm births (60%) and is a leading case of
newborn morbidity and death and a predictor of adverse health outcomes. Despite its high prevalence, there is
a limited understanding of how the in-utero environment contributes to the etiology of sPTB. Phthalates are
ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals that induce gene expression and physiological changes within the
placenta. Epidemiological studies identify a consistent positive relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure
and preterm birth. The goal of this study is to develop placental molecular signatures that can be used to
mechanistically link prenatal phthalate exposure and sPTB. Placental molecular signatures can explain
functional differences related to sPTB and identify targets for clinical and therapeutic interventions, including
modifiable risk factors such as environmental exposures. Our research team has generated the largest placental
transcriptomics dataset to date (N=760 samples) and has used this to develop transcriptomic signatures of
prenatal phthalate exposure and sPTB. This study will expand our existing transcriptomic signatures to include
microRNAs, which are essential to a complete molecular signature because they are highly stable, have been
linked to a number of environmental exposures, and are secreted into maternal circulation where they may serve
as biomarkers. Candidate microRNA studies have identified correlations between prenatal phthalate exposure
and expression of placental microRNAs, but a comprehensive assessment is needed to fully understand the role
of placental microRNAs in phthalate mediated toxicity. Moreover, despite the potential importance of placental
microRNAs as a biomarker of sPTB, there has not been a comprehensive analysis. In this proposal, we seek to
fill these research gaps and apply innovative computational biology strategies with rigorous epidemiological
approaches to gain insight into the mechanistic links between prenatal phthalate exposure, placental function,
and sPTB. In aim 1, we will generate microRNA data on placental samples and use this to generate a signature
of prenatal phthalate exposure. We will use the matched microRNA-mRNA sequencing data to construct a global
placental microRNA-mRNA network, which we will apply to identify connections between microRNAs and genes
whose placenta expression is associated with different phthalate metabolites. In Aim two, we will develop a multi-
omic molecular signature of sPTB using our placental microRNA-mRNA network. In aim 3, we will examine the
role of the placenta as a mechanistic link between prenatal phthalate exposure and sPTB by interdisciplinary
strategies including an integrated pathway analysis and a formal mediation analysis. Findings from this study
will inform chemical toxicological risk assessment and policy to reduce health impacts due to phthalate exposure
in pregnancy. microRNA signatures of sPTB may serve as functional biomarkers of sPTB since they can be
secreted into maternal circulation and be targets for clinical and therapeutic intervention in the future."

Doxorubicin (Dox) is a mainstay in the treatment of many cancers yet its utility is limited by cardiovascular toxicity.
While multiple mechanisms underlying this cardiotoxicity have been proposed, strategies targeting these
pathways have had marginal effects or interfere with anti-cancer effects of the drug. Such concerns have
restricted the clinical use of dexrazoxane which is currently the only FDA-approved cardio-protective agent. As
cancer survival rates improve and more patients are exposed to Dox, there is a critical need for new strategies
to mitigate the cardiotoxicity without comprising its therapeutic efficacy. Bioactive sphingolipids (SLs), especially
ceramide (Cer), are well-established mediators of the chemotherapy stress response across diverse cancers.
While this increased interest in targeting SL metabolism to enhance chemotherapy responses, targeting SL
metabolism to reduce chemotoxicities is largely unexplored. We recently identified the Cer-generating enzyme
neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) as a primary Dox-regulated SL enzyme in breast cancer. Here, our
preliminary studies begin to implicate nSMase2-derived Cer in the Dox-induced DNA damage response of
cardiomyocytes (CMs) and show that in vivo loss of nSMase2 activity protects from the onset of Dox-induced
cardiac dysfunction and damage. Crucially, nSMase2 appears to be dispensable for the in vitro and in vivo anti-
cancer effects of Dox on breast cancer. Based on these data, the central hypothesis is that the nSMase2-
ceramide pathway is essential for Dox-induced cardiotoxicity but dispensable for Dox-induced anti-cancer
activity. We propose three specific aims: The first aim will establish Dox-induced activation of the nSMase2-
Cer pathway in cardiac cells and tissues combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to establish nSMase2
induction in CMs as a major pathway of Dox-induced Cer generation in the heart. The second aim will define
the role of the nSMase2-Cer pathway in mediating Dox-induced cardiotoxicity using in vitro and in vivo loss
of function approaches to establish nSMase2 in CMs as a mediator of Dox-induced CM cell death and cardiac
fibrosis. The third aim will establish the therapeutic potential of nSMase2 inhibitors as cardioprotective
agents that do not interfere with the anti-cancer activity of Dox using syngeneic xenograft models of breast
cancer to demonstrate the efficacy of nSMase2 inhibitors as cardioprotective agents that do not interfere with
Dox reduction of tumor growth and metastasis. Overall, these studies will provide novel insight into the
pathogenesis of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and establish nSMase2 as a novel druggable target for
cardioprotection. This will provide a rational basis for the development of nSMase2 inhibitors as novel
cardioprotective agents."

 Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common adrenal disorder and the most common cause of
endocrine hypertension. PA is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that are disproportionately
higher compared to those observed in patients with similar degree of essential hypertension. The two major
types of PA are unilateral PA (typically an aldosterone producing adenoma, APA, ~40% of PA cases), which can
be cured with surgery, and bilateral hyperaldosteronism (BHA, ~60% of PA cases), which requires life-long
targeted medical therapy. Despite its high prevalence and serious cardio-renal complications, PA is
underdiagnosed, in part because the steps for diagnosis and subtyping are complicated, costly, and invasive.
Adrenal imaging is inaccurate in identifying the source(s) of excessive aldosterone production. Consequently,
the current standard-of-care for PA subtyping is adrenal vein sampling (AVS), which is an invasive, technically
challenging, and poorly standardized procedure, with availability limited to tertiary referral centers.
 The overall objectives of this application are: 1) to define the steroid synthetic capacity of various APAs
by implementing comprehensive histologic, genomic and steroid profiling analyses of APA tissue; 2) combine
baseline and dynamic blood tests to define the steroid signatures of PA subtypes in peripheral blood. This
approach will eliminate the need for AVS in over 60% PA patients (BHA). Two specific aims have been designed
to address critical gaps in the care of PA patients. • In Aim 1, we will probe the working hypothesis that APAs
with distinct underlying aldosterone-driver somatic mutations have specific steroid fingerprints. We will implement
CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry-guided next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize the somatic
mutations underlying APAs. In parallel, we will use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry to define the steroid
profiles of APAs from: (a) optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-embedded APA tissue; (b) blood from the adrenal
veins draining these tumors; and (c) peripheral blood. • In Aim 2, we will test the working hypothesis that panels
of steroid biomarkers measured in peripheral blood can distinguish APAs from both BHA and essential
hypertension. We will implement baseline and dynamic testing (ACTH stimulation and Dexamethasone
suppression) to identify differences between the steroid signatures of PA subtypes. Mass spectrometry will be
used to quantify steroids in patients with PA and essential hypertension. This approach will directly address the
critical clinical need to simplify PA diagnosis and subtyping and will take essential steps towards our long-term
goal, of expanding personalized PA treatment and maximizing the number of cured PA cases."

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a major opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the colon when normal gut
microbiota is disrupted. The large protein toxin TcdB is a major virulence factor responsible for diseases
associated with C. difficile infection (CDI). However, prior efforts to develop neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
and vaccines against TcdB have yielded unexpectedly low efficacy or even failure. We believe that a key
weakness of these previous studies might be the complexity of toxin variations seen clinically. While a single
toxin sequence from a reference strain has been widely used in all previous therapeutic development,
sequencing TcdB in clinical isolates in recent years has revealed a growing number of C. difficile strains as well
as variations in toxin sequences. This may account for the reduced neutralization efficacy of the only FDA-
approved monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, against some TcdB variants such as the one produced by a
hypervirulent strain (ribotype 027). The sequence variation and the toxin’s large size (~270 kDa) also pose
daunting challenges to develop effective vaccines using the traditional toxoid approach. Building on our recent
progress in identification of toxin receptors and understanding the structure and function of TcdB, here we
propose to develop receptor-decoy-based therapeutic proteins as broad-spectrum antitoxins and a new
generation of epitope-focused fragment-based vaccines, which could provide effective protection against most
of the known TcdB variants. Frizzled proteins (FZDs) and CSPG4 are two major host receptors for TcdB, and
we previously have revealed the mechanism by which TcdB recognizes FZDs. The first aim in this project is to
establish a structural understanding of TcdB binding to CSPG4. Our second aim will focus on design and
characterization of a family of bi-specific receptor-decoy proteins, which are composed of the optimized TcdB-
binding fragments of CSPG4 and FZDs. In the third aim, we will take advantage of our knowledge of the
structures of TcdB holotoxin, TcdB–antibody complexes, and TcdB–receptor complexes to design candidate
vaccines based on the selected highly conserved and functionally critical TcdB fragments. This project is built
on long-standing productive collaborations between the Jin lab and the Dong lab, combining their highly
complementary expertise in structural biology and protein engineering (Jin lab) and TcdB receptors/CDI
pathogenesis/animal models (Dong lab). Successful completion of this project will provide prototypes of
antitoxins for immunoprophylactic therapy and broad-spectrum candidate vaccines that offer prophylactic and
long-lasting protection."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for large majority of lung cancer diagnoses, and novel treatment strategies for this disease are urgently
needed. ATR and its downstream effector CHK1 are key component of replication stress (RS) response that
specifically deal with the stalled replication forks during DNA replication and are critical for cell survival under
RS. Inhibitors targeting ATR and CHK1 are currently being tested in clinical trials. However, only limited efficacy
has been observed when those agents are combined with standard therapy. Identifying the new synergistic
conditions that render cells sensitive to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors will be key to improving the efficacy of these agents.
Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), an enzyme controlling cholesterol biosynthesis by converting squalene to
oxidosqualene in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, including lung
cancer. High expression of SQLE is associated with poor prognosis. Our recent genome-wide loss of function
screen discovered that SQLE reduction led to enhanced sensitivity to a CHK1 inhibitor. Thus, the goal of this
application is to determine whether SQLE inhibition sensitizes NSCLC cells to ATR and CHK1 inhibitors and
whether high SQLE-expressing NSCLC cancer can be specifically targeted by the combined inhibition of SQLE
and ATR/CHK1. Our preliminary data suggest that SQLE inhibition by shRNA knockdown causes RS and
activates ATR/CHK1 activation. In addition, SQLE inhibition lead to increased protein expression of WIP1, a
phosphatase that suppress the activity of ATM, a master DNA damage response protein controlling DNA repair.
We hypothesize that SQLE inhibition leads to increased RS by suppressing DNA repair, rendering cells sensitive
to ATR and CHK1 inhibition. Thus, co-administration of an SQLE inhibitor and an ATR or CHK1 inhibitor could
synergistically suppress tumor growth. To test our hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1
will interrogate the mechanism by which SQLE inhibition leads to increased WIP1 expression. Specific Aim 2 will
determine whether SQLE inhibition leads to increased RS by impairing DNA repair, particularly homologous
recombination, a major repair pathway that prevents and antagonizes RS. Specific Aim 3 will assess the efficacy
of combined SQLE inhibition and ATR/CHK1 inhibition in suppressing tumor cell growth using in vitro assays as
well as cell line-based and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC. If successful, our studies will
reveal a new synthetic lethal interaction between inhibition of SQLE and ATR/CHK1 and will have a significant
impact on improving the survival of lung cancer patients by identifying novel therapeutic approaches."

Brain invasion, limited drug delivery, and treatment resistance render glioblastoma (GBM) virtually untreatable
with current surgical, chemo- and radiation therapy approaches. Tumor recurrence is nearly universal, and the
median patient survival (~15 months) has not changed significantly in 20 years. Radical new ideas and
approaches are needed to change the course of this devastating disease.
 New neurosurgical approaches to treating GBM are emerging with the FDA approval of minimally invasive
and image-guided technologies that now enable access to and treatment of previously unresectable and complex
recurrent tumors. A major advance has been the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided and
monitored, robotically controlled laser probes for intra-tumoral thermal treatments (e.g., laser interstitial thermal
therapy [LITT]). LITT is increasingly used to treat deep-seated, unresectable tumors through both direct thermal
ablation and priming to sensitize the tumor to radiation. Such thermal priming of solid tumors, including GBM,
has been known for decades to increase the efficacy of radiation treatment. However, tools to safely and
effectively accomplish this in neurosurgery have been lacking. Our clinical research team is leading two Phase
I trials (NCT04181684, NCT04699773) investigating LITT-based priming of GBM for enhanced radiation. While
the preliminary results in GBM patients have been promising, many patients (~40%) experience usually
temporary adverse effects, such as brain edema and seizures. We predict that improving the heat transfer within
the tumor and reducing thermal effects on surrounding brain tissues will reduce side effects and accelerate the
clinical translation and efficacy of this new approach.
 Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-enhanced photothermal ablation can increase thermal conductance and
capacitance within the tumor and reduce heat transfer to surrounding normal tissues. Combining AuNPs and
LITT offers the opportunity to improve the efficacy and safety of LITT. Our multidisciplinary team of experts in
surgical neuro-oncology (Woodworth), DART nanotechnology (Kim), GBM Fn14 biology (Winkles), and
plasmonic nanoparticles for photothermal therapy (Huang), is developing an advanced local drug delivery
strategy that bypasses the blood-brain barrier and leverages a novel Decreased nonspecific-Adhesivity,
Receptor-Targeted (DART) NP formulation. We have shown that DART nanoparticles, targeted to the tumor
necrosis factor receptor superfamily member fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), can penetrate tumor
tissues to provide more uniform dispersion and selectively bind to and enter GBM cells, including those in the
invasive margin. The central hypothesis is that controlled, monitored intratumoral delivery of Fn14-targeted
DART AuNPs will significantly enhance LITT for GBM with fewer side effects on surrounding brain tissues. We
will test this hypothesis in Fn14+ or Fn14- GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models using immunodeficient
rats and in an RCAS/tv-a-based transgenic rat model of Fn14+ human GBM."
10806954,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Precisely controlling the expression levels of genes is essential to any biological process. microRNAs
(miRNAs) play important roles in controlling gene expression by binding to speciﬁc target mRNAs and
downregulating their expression. To understand how a miRNA functions it is critical to both identify the set of
mRNA targets to which it binds in a speciﬁc biological context, and to determine how this pairing interaction
regulates gene expression to ultimately impact cellular processes and phenotypes. Some miRNAs can be
controlled by competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which bind miRNAs and prevent them from
downregulating expression of their mRNA targets, creating a complex network of regulation that can be difﬁcult
to experimentally unravel.
 The proposed research will develop a comprehensive experimental approach to uncover the biological
functions of a miRNA. As a model system the work focuses on two miRNAs (miR-1 and miR-206) that control
myogenesis, the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. The experiments use cultured mouse C2C12 cells, a
widely used model for myogenesis, as well as in vivo experiments with mice. In Speciﬁc Aim 1 experiments will
identify the direct RNA targets of miR-1 and miR-206 in undifferentiated C2C12 cells and during differentiation.
Supporting data demonstrate the success of a target identiﬁcation technique, which will be used with miR-1
and miR-206 knockout cells to identify mRNAs uniquely targeted by each miRNA. In Speciﬁc Aim 2, newly
identiﬁed targets of miR-1 and miR-206 during myogenesis will be screened for their contributions to
differentiation phenotypes. Experiments will also test the function of miRNA/target pairing in controlling the
expression levels of targets during myogenesis. In addition, the regulatory relationships of speciﬁc miRNA/
target pairs will be studied using mouse models. In Speciﬁc Aim 3 experiments will test the hypothesis that
RNA targets of miR-1 and miR-206 in undifferentiated cells function as ceRNAs to maintain proliferation and
prevent premature differentiation. The absolute levels of miRNAs and their targets in undifferentiated cells will
be quantiﬁed, targets will be screened to identify those important for maintaining cellular proliferation, and
regulatory mechanisms of ceRNAs will be investigated.
 Together the proposed studies develop an experimental framework to understand the functional roles of
two important miRNAs. This work will not only advance understanding of the roles of miR-1 and miR-206 in
myogenesis, but will also provide a comprehensive strategy that could be applied to other miRNAs in a variety
of biological systems."
10783062,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 223,000 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are hospitalized in the United States annually, with
more than 166 deaths each day. It has been demonstrated over the past two decades of clinical research that
cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), also known as “brain tsunamis,” are waves of electrical activity that
occur in 60% of patients with TBI. CSDs are waves of massive neuronal depolarization that cause periods of
electrical silencing and are independently associated with worse 6-month outcomes in TBI patients. It is
unknown whether CSDs cause damage beyond the area of local cortical spread, and it is unknown how CSDs
cause poor outcomes after TBI. We hypothesize that CSDs cause remote effects in hippocampus of TBI brain
that contribute to poor outcomes. We will test this hypothesis in an experimental model of TBI and CSDs. We
will define CSDs remote effects on electrophysiology, histopathology, and adult neurogenesis. Additionally, it
will be tested whether CSDs cause remote effects via a trans-synaptic mechanism. Understanding the remote
effects of CSDs will provide a paradigm shift in how we think about CSDs when they are observed clinically,
and provide insight into TBI therapeutics."

The DSM-V categorized gambling disorder as the first behavioral addiction. The World Health Organization
(WHO) identified problem gambling as a necessary area for further research, with a burden of harm surpassing
substance use disorder and diabetes. Impulsivity is an important trait found on clinical assessment of gambling
disorder, and gambling disorder can be induced by dopamine replacement medications in a clinical syndrome
termed impulse control disorder (ICD). Dopamine agonist therapy is more responsible than other dopamine
replacement options, with patients on dopamine agonists experiencing roughly three times greater odds of
developing ICD. Neuroimaging studies have pinpointed the striatum as a culprit brain region for dopamine
abnormalities, with recent technologic advances in human electrochemistry providing the temporal specificity
necessary to correlate sub-second dopamine fluctuations to differences in reward learning. The NIMH RDoC
construct ‘Reward Learning’ and its subconstructs, ‘Reward Prediction Error’ and ‘Probabilistic and
Reinforcement Learning’ provide a framework to investigate temporal differences in dopamine fluctuations
corresponding to differences in decision-making in ICD. Based on preliminary data showing dopaminergic
signaling is altered in ICD corresponding to impulsivity, this proposal will investigate the following specific aims:
(1) Quantify patients’ threshold for risk-taking and the behavioral influence of RPEs in patients with a history of
ICD both on and off dopaminergic medications. (2) Measure sub-second dopamine fluctuations in the striatum
during decision-making under risk. Methods will employ human reward learning tasks and simultaneous human
electrochemistry. Training will take place at the Wake Forest School of Medicine in the Neuroscience and the
Medical programs as a part of the MD/PhD program. The applicant will receive training in the human
electrochemistry and behavioral science methods necessary to accomplish the proposed aims. The applicant
also places an emphasis on analytical training in R programming. Mentorship includes a multidisciplinary team
with individuals in the neurosurgery and neuroscience departments. This team will provide the applicant with
feedback regarding project implementation, data collection and analysis, and manuscript preparation. The
proposed aims have the potential to provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of mental health
disorders that involve reward learning."
10755677,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ALS is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons with limited treatment options and a median survival
of 3-5 years. We submit a significantly revised proposal that addresses the comments of the reviewers and
provides new preliminary data. Our hypothesis is that the intestinal microbiome and its metabolites play
an important role in in ALS by modulating peripheral and CNS immunity and by affecting ALS disease
pathways. Our hypothesis is strengthened by a recent paper in Nature by Blacher showing an important role of
the gut microbiome and metabolites in ALS. In new preliminary data we show: 1) Antibiotics that worsen survival
also downregulate microglia homeostatic genes while upregulating inflammatory genes. 2) Changes in the
microbiome in 68 ALS patients vs. 61 healthy controls (largest microbiome study to date), including a decrease
in butyrate producing bacteria E. rectale and R. intestinalis, are robust when controlled for ALS clinical
confounders. 3) Administering these bacteria or Akkermansia reverses SOD1-disease associated transcriptional
changes in the spinal cord; including Fus, Oxr1, and Smn1, and protein degradation (Ubqln1). 4) Transferring
SOD1 microbiota to WT mice modulates microglia pathways involved in ALS related to RNA processing (Fus),
protein degradation (HSPa1b and USP2) and lysosomal transport (CD68 and Lyz2). We believe there is
compelling evidence to support the investigation of the microbiome in ALS. We will address these aims:
 AIM 1. Which microbial components are associated with protection in SOD1 and TDP-43 models?
We will deplete the microbiota with specific low-dose antibiotics, orally administer Akkermansia components and
a unique micro-RNA and identify brain, serum, and stool metabolites associated with disease protection.
 AIM 2. Which human microbiota components contribute to disease pathogenesis?
It is unknown whether the ALS microbiota can also drive disease pathogenesis. We will transfer microbiota from
patients with ALS to the SOD1 and TDP-43 models and measure motor function and survival time. We will
identify microbial populations, functions, and metabolites that are associated with protection or worsening of
disease. We will also confirm and expand our findings in the ALS microbiome in a newly recruited cohort.
 AIM 3. Investigate the immune mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates disease
progression in ALS animal models. We will sort microglia, monocytes, and T cells from mice treated with
individual antibiotics, colonized with ALS microbiota, or specific bacterial strains and characterize transcriptional
signatures by RNAseq. Utilizing WT mice to investigate how the microbiota affect microglia, we will transfer
specific microbes identified associated with ALS and screen for changes in genes involved in ALS pathogenesis."
10766184,"Project Summary: The role of obscurin and Obsl1 as key determinants for diastolic function
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality in the US, with heart failure
accounting for nearly 10% of CVD-related deaths in 2015. Heart Failure with preserved Ejection
Fraction (HFpEF) is responsible for half of heart failure hospital admissions, thereby presenting
a major health and socioeconomic problem. The diagnosis and development of treatment
options for HFpEF remains challenging, due to the diverse patient population, and the high
prevalence of heterogenous comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension. Several
pathomechanisms have been suggested to play major roles in the development of the disease.
However, the dearth of pre-clinical animal models and cardiac patient biopsies that allow for
proper characterization of the syndrome complicates the search for molecular pathways and
pathomechanisms.
We identiﬁed that mice lacking obscurin and the closely related obscurin-like 1 (Obsl1) die
prematurely and suﬀer from diastolic dysfunction, a key feature of HFpEF. Based on
preliminary data from this novel genetic disease model, we hypothesize that functional
insuﬃciency of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in combination with mitochondrial impairment found
in these mice, results in diastolic dysfunction. In this proposal, we aim to establish how loss of
obscurin/Obsl1 alters cardiac physiology, metabolism and calcium cycling. Of special interest
are novel Obsl1 interaction partners that directly tie functions of this protein to mitochondrial
impairment on the molecular level. We will also test if there is a gender divergence in the
susceptibility for this disease, as epidemiological HFpEF studies suggest. Outcomes from this
project will also determine metabolic and mitochondrial changes in the obscurin/Obsl1 double
knockout model that are associated with heart failure development. Finally, we will test if
overexpression of Perm1, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function is able
to alleviate diastolic dysfunction development.
Results from this study are expected to establish molecular roles for obscurin/Obsl1
insuﬃciency in the etiology of diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF, and determine molecular
targets for the development of novel therapeutics to treat the disease."

multi-omics data, carotid vascular and other cardiometabolic measures, brain imaging, cognitive
testing, and clinical MCI/ADRD data across the mid- to late-life transition period, coupled with in

stiffness to cognitive impairment and identify molecular and cellular mechanisms that can
explain the common co-occurrence of vascular and early AD/neurodegenerative pathologies
and could serve as targets for disease-modifying interventions."

Childhood cancer is the leading cause of disease-related death in children in the United States. The Children’s
Oncology Group (COG), one of five clinical trials groups supported by the National Clinical Trials Network
(NCTN), brings together more than 10,000 experts in childhood cancer representing diverse disciplines. More
than 90% of the approximately 16,000 children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer each year in the United
States are cared for at COG member institutions. The COG has nearly 100 clinical trials open, including trials to
refine front-line therapy for childhood cancer, study novel approaches to patients with recurrent disease, advance
understanding of cancer biology, and improve supportive care and quality of life for cancer survivors. The
functioning of COG is dependent upon scientific oversight for protocol development that occurs centrally and
oversight of clinical trial conduct that occurs locally at more than 200 member sites. Dr. Jeffrey Dome has been
a steady and substantial contributor to the COG ever since its inception over 20 years ago at both the central
and local levels. At the groupwide level, his major contribution has been his leadership of the Renal Tumor
Committee. From 2006-2016, he served as chair of this committee, which entailed oversight of more than 6,000
patients enrolled on the Biology and Classification Study and four front-line therapeutic trials. He successfully
guided the committee through the completion of the first generation of COG studies for childhood kidney cancers,
resulting in clinical practice change across the country. He remains involved as an advisor to the current
committee chair, member of the AREN1721, AREN1921, and AREN2231 study committees, associate vice-chair
for publications and leader of the efforts to foster collaborations with international cooperative groups. Dr. Dome
also serves on the COG Executive Committee, which advises the Group Chair on science and operations, and
the COG Scientific Council, which reviews all the new concepts and major amendments before they are reviewed
by the NCI steering committees. Future directions include opening three new COG renal tumor studies for
favorable histology Wilms tumor, malignant rhabdoid tumor and bilateral Wilms tumor as well as furthering the
study of novel biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA. At the local level, Dr. Dome serves as the institutional
Principal Investigator for COG studies at Children’s National Hospital, one of the largest and most active COG
sites. Between 2018-2020, Children’s National had 379 COG clinical trial enrollments, including 115 phase 1
enrollments and 37 phase 2 enrollments. In 2020, Children’s National was in the 98th percentile of all COG sites
for therapeutic enrollments. Future directions include improving the quality assurance and regulatory oversight
infrastructure to accommodate the increasing complexity of COG trials. The NCI Research Specialist Award will
provide an excellent mechanism to protect Dr. Dome’s time to continue to advance COG science."

The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of structural racism within Medicare Part-D policies and pharmacy
closures on racial/ethnic disparities in adherence to chronic medications among older adult Medicare Part-D beneficiaries.
Although ongoing efforts focus almost exclusively on addressing individual-level barriers to medication adherence, older
adult Black/Hispanic minorities encounter community-level barriers, including the geographic accessibility of pharmacies,
in adhering to their prescription medications not experienced by their White counterparts due to racial/ethnic residential
segregation. Pharmacy closures disproportionately affect segregated minority neighborhoods and worsen existing disparities
in the geographic accessibility of pharmacies. Medicare Part-D policies, including low pharmacy reimbursement rates and
the growth of preferred pharmacy networks that often exclude pharmacies located in minority neighborhoods, are considered
a fundamental cause of such closures. Despite these insights, the impact of closures on disparities in medication adherence,
and the role of structural racism within Part-D pharmacy access regulations, is not known. Pharmacy closures may be an
overlooked community-level mechanism of structural racism that exacerbates the adverse consequences of segregation on
disparities in pharmacy access and medication adherence. We propose to leverage several proprietary and public data
sources, including a census of Medicare Part-D patient-level prescription claims, to assemble a longitudinal, multi-level
geocoded dataset with detailed information on pharmacy locations and characteristics (e.g., preferred pharmacy status) and
derive a series of novel measures, including a multidimensional county-level measure of structural racism within Medicare
Part-D (e.g., ratio % of pharmacies located in Black vs. White communities that participate in Part-D preferred networks)
and conduct innovative analyses. The proposal aims to: (1) evaluate the effect of pharmacy closures on racial/ethnic
disparities in adherence to chronic medications among Medicare Part-D beneficiaries before (2014-2019) and during (2020-
2022) the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Determine the extent to which individual-level (e.g., dual-eligible) and community-
level (e.g., racial/ethnic composition) characteristics modify the effect of pharmacy closures on disparities in adherence to
chronic medications among Medicare Part-D beneficiaries and identify subgroups most at-risk for non-adherence post-
closure and in need of pharmacy services; and (3) Investigate the impact of exposure to structural racism within Medicare
Part-D on medication adherence among Medicare Part-D beneficiaries by race/ethnicity at the individual-level and
community-level. Our proposed work is innovative because it will be the first study to investigate the impact of pharmacy
closures on persistent disparities in medication adherence at older ages. Our analyses of multi-level causal pathways
responsible for changes in medication adherence post-closure is also novel. With respect to expected outcomes, the work
proposed will contribute evidence that policymakers need to advance Medicare Part-D payment and delivery reforms that
reduce, and not worsen, disparities in pharmacy closures and, in turn, medication adherence. These outcomes will have a
positive impact given the increasingly important role of pharmacies in preventive and emergency care and will support NIA
in its strategic goals of informing policy decisions and reducing health disparities."
10809764,"Inflammation and thrombosis fuel cardiovascular and pulmonary disease: Focus on the interplay of
neutrophil inflammasomes with NETs.
For many years, we have conducted a successful research program studying the links between thrombosis and
inflammation. We plan to continue this line of investigation with the current emphasis on neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs) and the role inflammasomes plays in neutrophils and NETosis. Upon neutrophil activation,
peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) citrullinates histones and promotes inflammasome assembly needed for
effective NETosis and IL-beta production. NETs trap microbes but we have shown a dark side of NETs, i.e., they
promote thrombosis, inflammation and age-related heart and lung fibrosis. The central hypotheses of our
program are as follows: NETs are involved in the formation of a stable, organized, and vascularized thrombus
and breaking up NETs is necessary for thrombolysis. Thrombosis promotes deposition of NETs in both the
adjacent vessel wall and in distant organs, leading to post-thrombotic syndrome and an increased systemic pro-
coagulant and pro-inflammatory state. Inflammation, activating inflammasome and NET generation as seen in
rheumatoid arthritis has systemic consequences such as the development of heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF). Inhibiting inflammation by NLRP3 inflammasome or PAD4 inhibitor in mice will reduce the
systemic effects and alleviate HFpEF development. We hypothesize further that in many diseases, inhibition of
NET formation and reduction of thromboinflammation would be beneficial to the host. We propose to test these
hypotheses using mouse and human blood cells, knockout mice and murine disease models we have developed.
The work by the “Wagner Lab” is considered innovative and solid; an objective measure is its high citation.
Obtaining prolonged funding would free time for more mentoring, innovative thinking, and helpful collegiate
activities. In addition, we now study chronic inflammatory and thrombotic diseases and their impact on aging.
These experiments take time, and the extended duration of support would assure that we can pursue this exciting
research program effectively."
10833512,"Project/Summary Abstract
Significant advances in our mechanistic understanding of progesterone receptor (PR) mediated transcription
are inextricably tied to our structural knowledge of the core transcriptional complex through which PR along
with its coregulators (Coregs) control target gene transcription. Pioneering the use of single-particle cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in steroid hormone nuclear receptor (NR) biology, we recently revealed the
quaternary structure of the transcriptional complexes for the estrogen receptor (ERa) and androgen receptor
(AR), which along with PR comprise the “NR triad” of sex steroid hormones that govern mammalian
reproductive biology. Unlike ERa and AR, PR is composed of the PR-A and PR-B isoforms that mediate both
distinct and overlapping progesterone transcriptional responses in physiological and pathophysiological
contexts. Accordingly, a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional response to progesterone can
only occur through a structural characterization of the core transcriptional complexes of the homodimer and
heterodimer configurations of these PR isoforms. Therefore, Aim 1 will use cryo-EM and complementary
structural proteomic approaches to solve the quaternary structure of the core Coreg/transcriptional complex
for the PR-A homodimer bound to DNA. Significantly, we have determined the core Coreg/transcriptional
complex for the PR-B homodimer. Not only has this structural information provided critical insights into the
unique assembly mechanisms by which PR-B recruits primary and secondary Coregs during transcriptional
complex formation but reconfirms our ability to successfully execute the structural studies in Aims 1 and 2.
Importantly, this technology presents a unique opportunity to investigate the contribution of the intrinsic
disordered region of the activation function 1 (AF1) in PR during Coreg/transcriptional complex assembly.
Despite its importance in PR mediated transactivation and its potential for therapeutic targeting, the AF1
domain (unlike the ordered AF2) is understudied due to its disordered topology. Using a PR AF1 mutant, Aim
2 will use cryo-EM and allied structural methods to assess the contribution of AF1’s structural disorder in the
dynamic assembly mechanisms that underpin Coreg recruitment by PR-B to the nucleating transcriptional
complex. This aim will be complemented by Aims 3 and 4, which will determine the transcriptional functional
role of PR’s AF1 disordered structure using innovative cell-free/cell-based investigations and a CRISPR-
engineered mouse model respectively. Collectively, these transformative investigations will: (i) furnish a much
needed structural and mechanistic framework to explain the PR isoform-specific functional differences in
physiological and pathophysiological contexts; (ii) define the structure-function relationship of AF1’s flexibility in
dynamic interactions with multiple Coregs at the cell- and whole organism-level; and (iii) offer new
opportunities to modulate PR isoform activity to clinically treat a spectrum of progesterone-dependent
gynecologic disorders."

Cancer care is becoming increasingly complex, with growing demands on patients’ energy and time. As a
result, patients often have to neglect their usual life activities and relationships. Such ‘time toxicities’ of cancer
are rarely acknowledged and play little role in care considerations. Further, no scoring systems exist to
measure the time burden of cancer care. Having to weigh potential survival benefits of treatments against
added time burdens especially affects those at risk of premature death. Therefore, there is a critical need to
measure and reduce the time toxicities of cancer. The overall objectives of the proposed research are to
describe and quantify sources of cancer-related time toxicity among individuals receiving treatment for cancer
and their effect on well-being, and to create time toxicity scores which can be used in future studies to identify
opportunities to minimize time toxicity. The general hypothesis is that combining sensor-based objective data
with subjective self-reported measures of time spent on healthcare-related activities will accurately measure
the time burden of cancer care and identify areas for interventions related to treatment delivery to reduce this
burden. This hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Measure and describe components of
objective time use associated with cancer-related healthcare interactions via a mobile health application; (2)
Characterize associations between measures of cancer-related time use and self-reported well-being, and
explore the role of context in modifying these associations; (3) Create a time toxicity summary score based on
measures of cancer-related time use and assess its association with psychosocial outcomes. We will conduct
a 28-day prospective cohort study of 80 individuals with advanced stage ovarian cancer or metastatic breast
cancer. Using an existing smartphone application, we will automatically track time spent on daily cancer
activities, augmented by participant-reported details on specific activities, well-being (daily), and quality of life
(baseline and end of study). We will estimate associations between objective time use and daily well-being,
explore variations in these associations by patient characteristics, develop a multidimensional scoring system
of time toxicity differentiating between episodic toxicity, travel toxicity, opportunity toxicity, and scheduling
toxicity, and measure the associations of these scores with patient reported psychosocial outcomes. Upon
completion we will have developed objective measures of daily time use by cancer activity and patient
characteristics (Aim 1), estimated associations with daily well-being and explored variations by patient
characteristics (Aim 2), and developed a multidimensional time toxicity scoring system (Aim 3). The proposed
research is innovative because time toxicity is a novel concept within cancer survivorship which we will capture
combining objective sensor data with self-report data. This study will have a significant impact because time
matters to patients and our measures of cancer care time burdens will facilitate future interventions to reduce
time toxicity."

Anemia is a nearly universal diagnosis in preterm infants, caused primarily by phlebotomy essential for medical
care, though also exacerbated by a variety of factors inherent to immaturity in the ex utero environment. When
severe enough to be treated with RBC transfusion, clinicians must be aware of the risk of critical adverse effects
such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory bowel necrosis characterized by infiltration of
macrophage precursor(s), and a leading cause of mortality in those born between 22- and 28-weeks’ gestation.
We have recently elucidated the connection between anemia and NEC, specifically, the “leaky gut” presentation
characterized by monocytic infiltration, RBC transfusion-associated activation of infiltrated monocytes, and the
resulting intestinal mucosal injury. Our long-term objective is to study the anemia-induced immunity changes in
the neonatal liver and their contribution to gut mucosal injury during RBC transfusion. Our preliminary studies
using our existing pre-clinical murine model of anemia demonstrate that anemia is associated with intestinal
recruitment of a unique population of monocytes (CD11bhiLy6Cmid) expressing triggered myeloid receptor 1
(trem1), similarly to monocytes developing in the neonatal liver but unlike those in the bone marrow or spleen.
Consistent with this, neonatal anemic liver monocytes displayed greater inflammatory activation to heme (found
in stored RBC) than did bone-marrow derived cells. This inflammatory response could be dampened either by
the use of anti-trem1 antibody treatment or by silencing monocyte trem1 expression. Taken together, the
investigators propose a novel hypothesis that in the setting of anemia, a gut-liver-gut boomerang effect takes
place as the leaky gut and associated bacterial translocation during anemia communicate via the portal vein to
the liver, triggering the expansion of hepatic leukocyte populations developing in situ which proceed to infiltrate
the anemic intestine, predisposing to RBC-associated gut injury. To test our central hypothesis, we will pursue
the following specific aims: Aim 1: Elucidate the ontogeny of monocytes recruited to the neonatal intestine during
anemia. Aim 2: Define the role of trem1 signaling on the migration of hepatic monocytes into the anemic intestine,
and on inflammatory activation during RBC transfusion. Aim 3: Determine whether therapeutic targeting of
hepatic trem1+ monocytes during anemia can prevent/attenuate RBC-transfusion associated NEC-like injury.
Accomplishment of the proposed aims will develop an effective therapeutic strategy of inhibiting the hepatic
response during anemia without suppressing protective innate immune mechanisms."

Inherited retinal disorders are a genetically heterogeneous group of blinding diseases that have significant impact
on quality of life. Therapeutic approaches have lagged significantly behind initial identification of the genetic
bases for these diseases. However, there are some striking successes; e.g., RPE65 gene augmentation therapy
was the first FDA-approved gene therapy for any genetically inherited disease. Clinical translation of current
CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been impeded by its low editing efficiency, error-prone homology-directed repair
(HDR), and substantial indel formation. Precision genome editing is an advanced, innovative CRISPR-Cas9-
associated genome-editing tool that addresses the limitations of typical CRISPR-Cas9 implementation. Adenine
base editors (ABEs) enable conversion of a point mutation independently of Cas9-induced double-stranded DNA
breaks and HDR. When base editing is not applicable (e.g., due to transversion mutations, large deletions, or
insertions), prime editing technology offers feasible alternatives. Genome editing is highly specific; however,
prolonged expression of base editors could lead to undesired off-target alterations throughout the genome and
transcriptome. We hypothesize that transient delivery of genome editors via RNPs and synthetic RNAs can
achieve the same high editing rates as those for genome editors delivered via viral transduction with reduced
off-target and bystander editing. Accordingly, we propose two thematically linked aims.
Aim 1. Correct inherited retinal disease-causing mutations in the rhodopsin gene (RhoE150K/E150K)
associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) via adenine base editing. Delivery of ABEs
will be optimized in the thoroughly characterized RhoE150K/E150K mouse model of RP. Proposed approaches will
provide a platform for ABEs to be quickly adapted to any suitable RPE or retinal mutation.
Aim 2. Repair the ABCA4 protein in Abca4PV/PV mice by prime editing. Using the PE3b prime editor and two
concurrent stabilized engineered prime-editing guide RNAs (epegRNA), we will restore functional ABCA4 protein
in Abca4PV/PV mice that carry double allelic mutations in photoreceptors and the RPE. Using immunoblotting and
next-generation sequencing for detecting rescued Abca4, and two-photon imaging techniques to detect A2E, we
will optimize genome editing efficiency in this animal model to improve prime-editing technology and its
application to treat inherited retinal diseases.
For both aims, we will test various means to deliver the editors transiently: (i) cell-penetrating peptides fused to
editors in purified ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-editing complexes; (ii) Coomassie-lipid tags on purified RNP-editing
complexes; (iii) viral-like particles containing RNP-editing complexes; or (iv) lipid nanoparticles containing
stabilized mRNAs of genome-editing materials for intracellular expression. These delivery systems will be
optimized first in engineered chromogenic cell lines. The efficacy of base and prime editing in mice will be
benchmarked against the level of expression of RPE65 in the rd12 animal model of Leber congenital amaurosis."

Despite being the most common forms of liver disease, alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD and
NAFLD) have no effective medical therapies. We must better understand the metabolic causes of these
conditions to develop new treatments. The long term goal of this work is to understand how elevated hepatic
NADH levels influence metabolism leading to pathogenic metabolic traits such as fatty liver and dyslipidemia,
and use this insight to develop new treatments for these conditions. We have found that elevated NADH levels
are a feature of AFLD, NAFLD, and a common GCKR P446L variant which causes hepatic fat accumulation in
humans. By using a new metabolic tool, LbNOX, to alter hepatic NADH levels in mice we have found that
NADH activates the lipogenic transcriptional factor ChREBP. Our overall objective is to determine how
elevated hepatic NADH leads to hepatic fat accumulation and dyslipidemia. Our central hypothesis is that
elevated NADH levels are a common mechanism leading to hepatic fat accumulation and dyslipidemia in both
NAFLD and AFLD through activation of the transcription factor ChREBP, and that hepatic NADH can be
directly targeted for beneficial metabolic effect. The rationale for this proposal is that showing elevated NADH
has a casual role in the development of NAFLD and AFLD would validate lowering hepatic NADH as a
therapeutic strategy to treat these conditions. Our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
aims: (1) We will define the ChREBP and NADH-dependent transcriptional and metabolic effects of GCKR
446L through the use of human liver organoids (HLOs) we have engineered to have different GCKR
genotypes. (2) We will determine the in vivo role of an NADH-ChREBP axis in mouse models of NAFLD and
AFLD using newly generated transgenic LbNOX mice. (3) We will identify novel genetic regulators of elevated
hepatic NADH and their relationship between hepatic fat and ChREBP activation using a large genetically
diverse outbred mouse cohort. The proposed work is significant because demonstrating the role of an NADH-
ChREBP axis in fatty liver disease will inspire new therapeutic strategies directly targeting hepatic NADH. This
work is innovative as it uses a combination of new metabolic tools and approaches to study metabolic disease
– including transgenic LbNOX mice and human liver organoids – as well as insights gained from human
genetics to understand and define the importance of this metabolic pathway."
10774215,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this research proposal is to maximize the cure rates of relapsed or refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin
lymphomas (NHL) by enhancing the capacity for targeted radionuclide therapies to comprehensively eliminate
residual disease. NHL is the most commonly diagnosed hematologic malignancy in the United States and several
subtypes portend poor outcomes, including so called “double hit” and “triple hit” disease. In addition, indolent
lymphoma remains generally incurable. While CAR T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy) offers promise
for R/R diffuse large B cell lymphoma, durable complete response rates have been reported in only 30-40% of
patients. NHL relapse is believed to result from the persistence of small tumor cell reserves that elude treatment.
The notable heterogeneity of NHL contributes to malignant cell escape and complicates a uniform approach to
therapy. Independent of responsiveness to other interventions however, virtually all NHL is exquisitely radiation
sensitive, giving radionuclide based approaches a unique advantage. Radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibodies can
achieve remissions in up to 95% of lymphoma patients failing conventional combination chemotherapy when
myeloablative doses of the radioimmunotherapy (RIT) are administered with stem cell support. While these
responses are encouraging, low tumor-to non-tumor ratios of absorbed radiation, toxicity, and unacceptable
rates of relapse form the rationale for the ongoing work of this grant proposal. The proposed projects leverage
novel RIT delivery methods developed during prior funding periods and shown to dramatically improve tumor-to-
normal organ ratios of absorbed radiation. Clinical experience dictates that multi-agent combinations are
generally most effective in the treatment of NHL. This proposal explores three RIT combination strategies with a
goal of generating unvarying efficacy across NHL subtypes through targeting the presumptive cause of relapse,
occult residual disease. To achieve this goal, Aim 1 will employ the rational pairing of two targeted radionuclides,
first using the longer path length and modest linear energy transfer (LET) of β-emitter therapy to safely debulk
NHL tumors, followed by an extremely high LET and short path length α-emitter to eliminate residual disease.
Aim 2 will explore combining the ability of RIT to trigger tumor cell death with the pro-apoptotic efficacy of
emergent BH3 mimetics. Aim 3 will examine RIT combined with rationally selected immune checkpoint inhibitors,
in a novel tumor vaccine approach to eradicating residual disease. Collectively these proposed studies test the
hypothesis that RIT combination approaches will reduce the total radiation dose required to effectively treat NHL,
in a manner that facilitates rapid translation through our non-Hodgkin lymphoma clinical RIT program."

Despite the mounting risk loci in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neuropsychiatric disorders,
identifying the causal variants/genes has been challenging, which hinders the translation of GWAS findings
into novel disease biology. A major hurdle is that most risk variants lie in noncoding regions of DNA without
easily interpretable function. Noncoding regulatory sequences often reside in open chromatin regions (OCRs).
With human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) neurons as a model in our initial productive R01 period, we
have identified abundant regulatory variants in OCRs that affect chromatin accessibility, exhibiting allele-
specific open chromatin (ASoC). ASoC SNPs frequently affect gene expression and are strongly enriched for
schizophrenia risk variants. However, most causal variants/genes of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric
disorders remain unknown. Because regulatory variants often act in specific biological context, e.g., cellular
stimulation or perturbation, we hypothesize that many neuropsychiatric disease variants may alter chromatin
accessibility and gene expression only in activated neurons. Various neuronal stimuli cause membrane
depolarization, resulting in robust activity-dependent chromatin and expression changes in mouse neurons.
Our pilot data in KCl-depolarized human neurons also showed substantial activity-dependent chromatin and
expression changes, notably, with hundreds of activity-dependent ASoC SNPs some of which are
schizophrenia risk variants. Leveraging the tractable hiPSC model that can be perturbed in the context of
genetic variation, this competitive renewal application will address three specific questions: (1) To what extent
genetic variation influences neural activity-dependent chromatin accessibility and gene expression? For this,
we will assay cell type-specific chromatin and expression at single-cell resolution in both baseline and
activated neurons of a well-powered hiPSC cohort, and perform quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to identify
activity-dependent ASoC and expression QTL (eQTL). (2) What is the contribution of activity-dependent
regulatory variants to neuropsychiatric disorders? For this, we will jointly analyze ASoC and eQTL SNPs with
neuropsychiatric GWAS datasets to fine-map causal disease variants that affect activity-dependent chromatin
and expression, followed by a multiplex CRISPR base editing to validate their function and cis-target genes. (3)
What is the mechanism of activity-dependent chromatin changes? For this, we will examine whether activity-
dependent chromatin regions are enriched for specific transcriptional factors (TFs), and explore the effects of
CRISPR-editing of TFs on chromatin accessibility, expression, and cellular phenotypes in human neurons. This
study will yield novel mechanistic insights into the contribution of neural activity-dependent chromatin and
expression changes to neuropsychiatric disorders."
10755719,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Insulin secretion deficiency is a hallmark of diabetes. In this process, the cortical actin of β cells has recently
been recognized as a critical player contributing to diabetes pathogenesis. β cells from type-2 diabetes (T2D)
patients show significant signaling alteration associated with cortical actin remodeling, and restoring such
abnormality rescues insulin secretion to normal levels. Cortical actin is thought initially as a simple barrier to
prevent insulin secretion, but recent studies challenge this view and imply an active role. Mounting evidence
further indicates that cortical actin is a converging point and effector of multiple metabolic signals in β cells.
However, the molecule and nanostructure basis of its remodeling remains unresolved. Addressing this question
becomes imperative to understanding the regulation of insulin secretion and developing new therapeutics to
restore β cell function in T2D. This proposal will investigate ArpC3, a gene encoding a subunit of the Arp2/3
complex that dictates actin filament branching and cortical remodeling. Although multiple signaling pathways
converge on Arp2/3, the mechanism downstream Arp2/3 activity to regulate insulin secretion remains unknown.
Based on recent progress in the field and our new data on β cell imaging and functional assays, we hypothesize
that ArpC3-dependent actin polymerization regulates insulin exocytosis by driving the local cortical actin
disassembly-reassembly cycles. Through this remodeling, cortical actin filaments may actively coordinate the
critical steps of granule trafficking and insulin secretion. We have assembled a team of investigators with
expertise in diabetes, β cell biology, vesicle trafficking, and super-resolution microscopy to test this hypothesis.
We will focus on three specific aims. First, determine the in vivo role of ArpC3-mediated cortical actin remodeling
in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. We have generated a new mouse model where ArpC3 is deleted
selectively in adult β cells to ablate Arp2/3 activity and cortical actin branching. Second, define ArpC3 function
in cortical actin nano-remodeling and its role in insulin granule recruitment, docking, and exocytosis. Third,
evaluate the role of cortical actin branching in human β cells and its dysfunction in T2D patients. The results from
this work will fill a long-standing knowledge gap between cortical actin remodeling and insulin secretion, providing
mechanistic insights into T2D pathogenesis induced by cortical actin dysfunction."
10768608,"Objectives: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is strongly associated with many aspects of military
service including blast injury. The overall objectives of this proposal are to improve the prevention
and treatment of SNHL in Veterans.
Research Design: We previously used in vitro screening to identify novel compounds that can protect
hair cells (HCs) from ototoxic damage. We tested them in vivo against noise-induced hearing loss
(NIHL) and found partial protection. We also used high-resolution proteomics to identify additional
processes involved in NIHL. Overall, our results suggest that many cellular processes contribute to HC
damage. In this application we propose to screen compound combinations targeting diverse HC
damage and survival processes, to identify the most effective combinations. This will allow us to
identify optimal strategies for further development as pharmacological interventions in humans, using
compound combinations and/or multi-acting compounds.
Methodology: Studies will be performed in vitro using aminoglycoside damage or in vivo using noise
damage to the cochlea. For in vivo studies, intracochlear or intratympanic delivery of HC protectants
will begin immediately after exposure. We will use a well-established mouse model of noise damage,
chronic delivery of compounds to cochlear perilymph or the round window with osmotic minipumps,
serial auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE)
audiometry, and morphological evaluation of cochlear HCs and afferent nerve endings.
Progress over the past period of funding: During the past period of funding, using the mammalian
organ of Corti, the only tissue containing the damage-sensitive mammalian outer HCs, we screened
several compound libraries. We identified a broad range of compounds targeting different cellular
processes, that were effective in protecting HCs. We then transferred selected compounds to an in
vivo model of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), where we also noted protection. We also
completed the first-ever high-resolution proteomics study of NIHL, which identified many proteins
and processes not previously known to be involved in noise damage, and which are potential targets
for pharmacotherapy. We also performed the first high-resolution proteomic study of isolated HCs.
In addition, we completed studies of gene regulation relevant to HC regeneration, and found that
gene therapy with espin1 dramatically enhanced stereocilia formation on regenerating HCs. We
discovered a novel protective HC pathway mediated by ATP receptors that reduce activity in HCs at
high stimulus levels, protecting them from noise damage. Our studies resulted in 18 peer-reviewed
publications to date.
Clinical Relationship: The prevention and treatment of SNHL is of great importance to Veterans
and the VA. The effects of SNHL on Veterans’ quality of life are substantial. SNHL and tinnitus also
account for more disability compensation in the VA than any other disorder, and rehabilitation costs
are high. The proposed research is targeted at developing new and improved therapies for
prevention and treatment of this important health problem."
10767850,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide, accounting for 10.4 million new
cases and 1.3 million deaths annually. An understanding of the immune response to Mtb is of central importance
in the development of improved vaccines. In this regard our laboratory, under the auspices of the VA Merit
Program, has defined Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells as a class of cells that are restricted by the
highly conserved MR1 molecule, recognize Mtb-infected cells, have effector capacity in the thymus and cord
blood, yet display evidence for memory following exposure to Mtb, and are enriched in the lungs.
MAIT cells are found in tissues such as the lung and intestine. Because MAIT cells recognize small molecules,
such as metabolites of riboflavin, we postulate that the cell surface expression of MR1 is tightly regulated to
avoid activation of these cells in the absence of intracellular infection. Indeed, with the support of the VA Merit
Program, we have found that MR1 is both located in an endosome, requires a ligand for translocation to the cell
surface, and is dependent on vesicular trafficking for the presentation of Mtb-derived antigens to MR1T cells.
Furthermore, we find that the mechanisms underlying presentation of Mtb-derived antigens can be distinguished
from antigens that are exogenously delivered, suggesting that there are specialized mechanisms for sampling
the intracellular environment.
Therefore, in this application we will focus on defining the molecular mechanisms that allow for the appropriate
presentation of intracellular infection, with a focus on Mtb. We will 1) Define the molecular chaperones required
for the presentation of microbials ligands, and 2) Define the role of MR1 SNPs and splice variants in controlling
the recognition of the Mtb infected cell, and will evaluate these variants in clinically relevant outcomes following
exposure to Mtb.
This project contains two Aims:
AIM 1: Define the molecular chaperones necessary for the presentation of Mtb-derived ligands
1a. Determine the molecular chaperones associated with MR1.
1b. Determine the role of riboflavin transporters in the uptake or trafficking of MR1 ligands.
AIM 2: Define the role of MR1 SNPs and splice variants in human susceptibility to TB
2a. Determine the relationship of MR1 SNPs and splice variants and clinical outcomes associated with
 exposure to Mtb.
2b. Determine the functional significance of MR1 SNPs.
2c. Determine the relationship of MR1 splice variant expression and the capacity of cells to present MR1
 ligands to MR1T cells."
10767825,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in our veterans is putting them at elevated risk of fracture and
fracture-associated death. Nearly 1 of every 3 veterans has CKD, fracture risk in persons with CKD is 4x
higher than the age-matched general population, and persons who fracture with CKD have longer
hospitalization and higher mortality rates than patients without CKD who fracture. Simply stated, interventions
aimed at reducing CKD-associated fracture would have a significant impact on veteran health. Skeletal fragility
in CKD is unique from conditions such as osteoporosis. The hallmark of CKD-associated bone change is that
cortical bone develops porosity (holes) and also has clear changes to bone material properties Moving forward,
approaches to reduce skeletal fragility in CKD will need to address both reversal of cortical porosity and
improvements in material properties. The goal of this proposal is to provide foundational data on cortical bone
infilling in the setting of CKD. We will test the overall hypothesis that reversal of cortical porosity with enhanced
material quality can combine to improve bone mechanical properties in CKD. To achieve this goal we will use
two complementary animal models of kidney disease, one, the Cy/+ rat, to allow dynamic tracking of porosity
changes over time. The second, an adenine-induced model, to allow sex-based differences in porosity
dynamics and treatment efficacy to be studied. Both of these models have parallels the human disease in its
development of disturbed mineral homeostasis and bone fragility. This means the results from this work will
have high translational capacity to the clinic. In Aim 1 we will determine the effectiveness of suppressing bone
resorption with and without simultaneous PTH suppression on cortical porosity infilling in CKD. Two clinically-
relevant approaches will be studied – cinacalcet (to reduce parathyroid hormone) and
bisphosphonate (to reduce osteoclastic bone resorption). Using two complementary animal models of
CKD that develop robust cortical porosity, we will treat both male and female animals with either low-dose
bisphosphonate or cinacalcet. Key outcomes will be cortical porosity, using repeated in vivo microCT scans,
combined with a novel analysis approach that permits tracking of individual cortical pores over time. These
experiments will help us to understand how pore infilling occurs using clinical approaches and how this may
differ between sexes. In Aim 2 we will determine the effects of porosity infilling on tissue and structural
mechanical properties. Tissues from Aim 1 will be measured with Raman spectroscopy and nano-indentation
to characterize the mineral and collagen properties/mechanics of the newly infilled pore tissue. Whole bone
mechanical properties (monotonic and fracture toughness) will be used to assess overall bone properties as
surrogate measures of fracture resistance. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if combination treatment,
targeting both pore infilling and modification of the infilled matrix is more effective in improving mechanical
properties of CKD animals compared to either monotherapy. We have shown that raloxifene, a FDA-approved
agent for treating bone, specifically benefits material properties. Furthermore, we have developed a novel
analog for raloxifene that maintains beneficial effects on bone matrix with reductions in traditional cell-mediated
effects. The experiments proposed will determine if the combination of infilling pores with enhanced properties
of the matrix will have overall benefits. Collectively, the experiments proposed and the data to be generated
will provide foundational data on pore infilling and serve as a platform on which to build a clinical regimen for
reducing the skeletal burden and improving the quality of life of veterans suffering from CKD."
10755733,"Project Summary:
 AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical evolutionarily conserved energy sensor that regulates
energy homeostasis by monitoring changes in the intracellular AMP or ADP to ATP ratios. Mounting evidence
supports that the AMPK pathway is one of the major signaling players at the interface of metabolism and cancer.
However, the role of AMPK in tumor progression and metastasis remains obscure. Our recent analysis on
melanoma cancer genomics data has revealed that the mutations in the PRKAA2 gene, which encodes the alpha
2 catalytic subunit of AMPK, occur in 8-10% of cutaneous melanomas and tend to co-occur with NF1 mutations.
In our preliminary studies, we found that knockout of AMPKα2 promoted anchorage-independent growth of
mutant NF1-melanoma cells in soft agar assays and their growth as xenografted tumors in nude mice.
Importantly, we found that expression of AMPKα2 is significantly downregulated in human melanoma brain
metastasis samples compared to patient-matched extracranial metastasis samples. Furthermore, knockout of
AMPKα2 promoted brain metastasis of NF1-mutant Mewo melanoma cells in nude mice. Based on these
preliminary results, we hypothesize that inactivation of AMPKα2 in melanoma promotes tumor
progression to melanoma brain metastasis. In Aim 1, we will establish the role of AMPKα2 in melanoma brain
metastasis using mouse models and human samples. We plan to characterize the effects of AMPKα2 loss in
both syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models. Human melanoma brain metastasis samples will be
used to explore the contribution of AMPKα2 loss through spatial single cell RNA-seq analyses. In aim 2, we will
characterize downstream targets of AMPK involved in the metabolic regulation of melanoma brain metastasis.
We will investigate the contribution of a novel putative substrate of AMPKα2 involved in de novo lipogenesis,
identified in our preliminary studies, to melanoma brain metastasis, and explore additional new AMPKα2 targets
through comprehensive metabolomics and RPPA analyses of tumor samples from mouse models. In aim 3, we
will assess the therapeutic effects of metabolic drugs targeting the AMPK pathway on enhancing the efficacies of
targeted- and immune- therapies in melanoma brain metastasis using human melanoma xenografts, syngeneic
and genetically engineered mouse models. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a team of investigators
with various expertise including cancer cell metabolism, melanoma brain metastasis biology, melanoma
oncologists/surgeon and computational biology. Our study will not only provide critical insights into the role of
AMPK metabolic signaling in melanoma brain metastasis addressing a significant knowledge gap in the field, but
also identify novel therapeutic approaches to target melanoma brain metastasis."
10753584,"Residual cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients on lipid lowering therapy is a major unmet clinical need.
Our goal is to investigate mechanisms of plaque stabilization and destabilization focused on functions of vascular
smooth muscle cell (SMC) derived cells (SDCs), and their crosstalk with macrophages (Mϕ), in mouse models
and human CVD. We focus on SDC types, location and functions and their interactions with Mϕ in plaque stability
in disease progression and regression. SMCs can transition through an intermediate state into atheroprotective,
e.g., fibrochondrocyte (SMC-FbC), or atherogenic, e.g., SMC-derived macrophage-like (SMC-Mϕ) identities.
Master regulators of SDC identities are emerging for protective (retinoic acid, Tcf21) and harmful (Klf4) types,
but mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesize that SDC functions in lesion stability and clinical CVD
are malleable and can be inferred from spatial and single-cell (sc) omics; SMC-Mϕ are inflammatory and activate
bystander Mϕ to promote plaque instability; oxidative DNA (ox-DNA) damage regulates SDC identities and
functions to destabilize lesions; and crosstalk of atherogenic SDCs and Mϕs promotes lesion instability and
impairs regression. Aim 1 will determine locations and functions of SDC types in atherosclerosis progression
and test if SMC-Mϕ and SDC ox-DNA damage drive atherogenic SMC identities and lesion instability while Aim
2 will address whether some SDCs promote and others curb plaque stabilization in atherosclerosis regression,
and if regression is attenuated by SMC-Mϕ and SDC ox-DNA damage. In these Aims, we will; (1) integrate
spatial hybridization-based RNA in situ sequencing (HybRISS), sc-omics and SMC lineage tracing to define
identity, spatial functions, and master regulators of SDCs during lesion progression and regression, focusing on
functions such as SMC-Mϕs inflammasome and impaired efferocytosis; (2) use a diphtheria toxin (Dtx) mouse
model to track SMC-Mϕ and to test if depletion of SMC-Mϕ reduces lesion instability in progression and
accelerates resolution; and (3) use an SMC-inducible 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) transgenic mouse
model to test if SMC ox-DNA damage, which is increased in atherosclerosis, pushes SDCs to atherogenic
identities. Aim 3 will test if specific SDC types and their regulatory genes promote clinical CVD. Using multi-omic
data from the Munich Vascular Biobank, we will deploy an integrated strategy to go from descriptive studies in
human plaques, to regulatory genetic variation in SDCs, to testing causal relationship of these variants with
clinical CVD in large genetic data. Our work will provide mechanistic insight into the role of SDC types, their
spatial functions, and crosstalk with Mϕ to achieve our overall goal of greater mechanistic understanding of
factors affecting atherosclerotic plaque stability and instability. Human translation will establish clinical relevance,
causality and context for new treatment strategies for CVD."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cause of cancer mortality in the US with 53,200
deaths expected in 2021, even though this number could be greatly reduced through appropriate screening.1
Compared to their urban counterparts, individuals living in rural areas experience a 50% higher incidence of
CRC (OR 1.50, CI:1.43-1.57) and 35% higher mortality (OR 1.35,CI: 1.26-1.45), with rural segments of the US
falling far below the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable CRC screening goal of 80%.2-4-5 Equally poor
results are found for the resolution of a positive fecal immunological test (FIT) result, which occurs in 8% of all
patients initially tested with FIT. Only 50 to 55% of individuals with positive FIT results follow through with a
diagnostic colonoscopy.7-11
One of the most effective approaches to increasing CRC screening is an evidence-based intervention (EBI)
combining a mailed (FIT) and patient navigation (PN).12 Unfortunately, implementation of this EBI in rural
settings is limited. Thus, in response to the call to identify strategies for overcoming barriers to the adoption of
evidence-based interventions (PAR-19-274), we will evaluate the effectiveness of bundled facilitation
implementation strategies to increase uptake of EBI’s for CRC screening. Our aims support the modeling
necessary to guide future implementation of the EBI for CRC screening in rural clinics.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the ability of an implementation of an EBI to improve CRC screening and diagnostic
colonoscopy rates, defined as completed screening episode (effectiveness) through implementation of an EBI
for CRC screening in rural Indiana. We hypothesize that a complete screening episode of CRC screening (FIT
or screening colonoscopy), including diagnostic colonoscopy uptake following positive FIT, will be higher
following implementation of an EBI and throughout maintenance compared to baseline (usual care).
Resolution with diagnostic colonoscopy and repeat screening with FIT will be handled as exploratory
outcomes. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the variation in contextual factors (innovation, recipient, inner and outer
context), implementation strategies and implementation outcomes (reach and implementation) using mixed
data (qualitative interviews and quantitative measures) to build implementation profiles of nine rural clinics.
In Aim 3, we estimate the cost and budget impact of the deployment of implementation strategies and
processes for rural clinics and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing and sustaining the CRC
screening intervention."

Excessive alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. and responsible for
2.7 million years of potential life lost annually. Emergency departments (EDs) provide care for patients with
AUD experiencing a variety of alcohol related and unrelated health problems, including illness and injury. Thus,
the ED encounter presents a unique opportunity to screen, enhance motivation, initiate medication treatment,
and refer to continuation care patients who both seek and do not seek AUD treatment. While combined
pharmacological and behavioral therapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD) have demonstrated efficacy in
specialty and primary care settings, their effectiveness in the ED setting is unknown, and EDs do not routinely
provide comprehensive interventions for AUD. The proposed open label randomized clinical trial (RCT) will
evaluate two ED-based intervention models to increase AUD treatment provision and patient engagement. ED
patients with moderate to severe AUD (N=240) will be randomly assigned to: (1) Screening, Brief Intervention
and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) (n=120); or (2) SBIRT with ED-initiated medications for AUD (SBIRT+ED-
MAUD) (n=120). Gabapentin and extended release or oral naltrexone will be offered as a combination
pharmacotherapy in the ED-MAUD component. SBIRT intervention in both study arms will utilize a facilitated
referral with direct linkage to continuation AUD treatment following the ED visit. The primary outcome measure
will be the rate of AUD treatment engagement assessed on day 30 post randomization in each of the two study
groups (Aim 1). The study will also evaluate the between-group difference in the reductions of heavy drinking
days from 30 days prior to 30 days post randomization (Aim 2). A statistically significant effect on the primary
outcome and a clinically meaningful effect on the reductions of heavy drinking days favoring the SBIRT+ED-
MAUD are hypothesized. All enrolled patients will be followed daily on days 1-7 using a brief electronic survey
to assess their alcohol cravings, withdrawal symptoms and medication adherence, and with comprehensive
follow-up assessments at 30- and 90-days post randomization. The primary outcome, AUD treatment
engagement on day 30 post the ED visit, will be based on clinical records documentation obtained from the
AUD treatment provider. Alcohol consumption outcomes, medication adherence, the intensity of alcohol
cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and other important study outcomes will be based on patient self-report
using validated assessment instruments. The planned study sample and the proposed analytical methods will
allow for additional meaningful exploratory evaluations of potential differential effects of gender, race, ethnicity,
insurance types, and housing instability on the evaluated outcomes. No prospective studies of ED-initiated
MAUD interventions have been reported. If successful, the proposed study will provide critically important
evidence needed to support a broader dissemination of ED-based interventions for AUD, including MAUD."
10754595,"The quantal nature of synaptic transmission depends on the transport of neurotransmitter into synaptic
vesicles (SVs), an activity driven by a H+ electrochemical gradient (∆µH+). In contrast to relatively stable ionic
gradients across the plasma membrane, ∆µH+ and other ions including Cl- fluctuate with the exo- and endocytosis
of SVs. Vesicle filling requires coordination with these changing conditions and hence regulation of transport.
 In contrast to the SV uptake of most transmitters that relies primarily on the chemical component of ∆µH+
(∆pH), uptake of the principal excitatory transmitter glutamate depends predominantly on membrane potential.
The vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) also exhibit unusual properties, including allosteric regulation by
lumenal H+, cytosolic and lumenal Cl- and an associated Cl- conductance. We hypothesize that these
mechanisms coordinate glutamate flux with different steps in the exo- and endocytic recycling of synaptic
vesicles. The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand how these properties of the VGLUTs contribute
to excitatory neurotransmission. The strategy is to determine how these mechanisms regulate VGLUT activity,
and use this information to characterize their physiological role. This program takes advantage of our previous
work identifying these regulatory mechanisms, assays we developed to study them, recent structural information
and VGLUT knockout neurons that we can use to test rescue by mutants.
Aim 1: Elucidate the mechanism and physiological role of pH in vesicular glutamate transport. The
requirement for allosteric activation of the VGLUTs by lumenal H+ suggests a mechanism to prevent tonic efflux
of glutamate across the plasma membrane that would degrade the quantal signal. We recently identified a single
residue that confers the pH requirement of vesicular glutamate transport. We will now use this information to
determine how pH regulates glutamate transport and how this regulation influences excitatory transmission.
Aim 2: Determine how Cl- allosterically regulates vesicular glutamate transport. We recently found that an
extensive cytoplasmic interaction network influences the allosteric regulation by lumenal pH on the other side of
the SV membrane, suggesting that the alternating access involved in glutamate transport depends on the
balance in strength between cytoplasmic and lumenal gates. We hypothesize that Cl- also affects the two gates,
either directly or indirectly. We will thus determine how the cytoplasmic interaction network and lumenal residues
contribute to allosteric regulation of glutamate flux by cytoplasmic and lumenal Cl-.
Aim 3: Aim 3: Determine how lumenal Cl- affects glutamate storage and release. Removal of extracellular
Cl- prevents recovery from the synaptic depression that normally follows strong stimulation. To determine
whether this reflects a requirement for the efflux of lumenal Cl- mediated by a VGLUT-associated conductance,
we will rescue VGLUT1/2 double knockouts with mutants lacking the conductance, and monitor the effects on
glutamate release and SV pH."

 Graft integration of microvasculature is a critical next step for cell replacement strategies for type I
diabetics. The incorporation of host-connected microvasculature is essential for post-implantation graft survival
and over the longer-term impacts the kinetics of glucose response and systemic insulin delivery. Directing
angiogenesis into islet-containing synthetic hydrogels would guarantee host-connected microvasculature in the
graft, but control over angiogenesis remains limited. Our long-term goal is to understand how physical cues from
the cellular microenvironment impinge upon critical steps of angiogenesis and devise engineering methods to
incorporate these cues into translatable biomaterials. Angiogenesis involves a series of spatiotemporally
controlled cellular programs including endothelial tip cell activation and directed invasion, collective migration of
leading tip cells and ensuing stalk cells, and proliferation and lumenization of the multicellular strand. Our prior
work demonstrates a critical balance between tip cell migration and stalk cell proliferation during collective
migration required for forming functional microvessels, and that hydrogel degradability modulates the collectivity
of endothelial cell migration. Further, we have pioneered hydrogel composites containing physical cues in the
form of synthetic fibers that promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cause quiescent endothelial
cells to adopt invasive behavior suggestive of tip cells that lead angiogenic sprouts. Together, these observations
motivate our central hypothesis: modular control of hydrogel structure can drive the angiogenic formation of
microvasculature that supports the function of hPSC-derived pancreatic islet organoids. Using novel composite
hydrogels, organotypic tissue models, and assessments of vascular and islet function in vivo, we aim to
understand the microenvironmental regulation of endothelial cell decision-making during angiogenesis. In Aim
1, we will utilize hydrogel composites containing cell-adhesive guidance fibers to phenotypically transition
quiescent endothelial cells into invasive tip cells. In Aim 2, we will engineer hydrogel crosslinking and microscale
porosity to drive endothelial stalk cells proliferation and establish quantitative relationships between collective
migration of stalk cells, proliferative events, and microvessel lumenization. In Aim 3, we will use in vitro and in
vivo models to examine the impact of material-guided angiogenesis and resulting microvasculature on the
function of hydrogel grafts containing hPSC-derived islets. The proposed studies will 1) shed light on the
microenvironmental regulation of phenotypic transitions during angiogenesis and 2) identify biomaterial design
parameters that support functional angiogenesis. We anticipate the developed strategies to provide
microvascular support to engineered pancreatic islet grafts will have bearing on grafts containing other
metabolically demanding parenchymal tissues."
10809001,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For this proposal we intend to develop a novel vaccine to prevent and possibly treat Human T cell leukemia
virus type-1 (HTLV-1) associated diseases. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus that is the causative agent of a
malignant T CD4+ cell lymphoproliferation referred to as Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), as well as
several inflammatory disorders with the most problematic being human myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis
(HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 infection is endemic in many areas around the world including southern Japan, the southern
United States, central Australia, the Caribbean, South America, equatorial Africa, and the middle East. Over 10
million people may be infected worldwide. It is estimated that approximately 5% of HTLV-1 positive individuals
will develop ATL, and 2% HAM/TSP. Seropositive rates in certain areas reach 20–40% among people aged over
50 years. With millions affected worldwide, HTLV-1 is a major problem in endemic communities and remarkably,
there are no effective vaccine or treatment options to prevent ATL or HAM/TSP afflicted individuals. Given
this, aim to develop and test the efficacy of a novel vaccine to prevent HTLV1-mediated disease.
Aim 1: To evaluate the immunogenicity, in immunocompetent murine models, including mice with a humanized
immune system (NSG™-SGM3) VSV-based vaccine vectors that express the HTLV-1 glycoprotein and
regulatory proteins TAX and HBZ (VSV-gp62-∆HT). The ability of our candidate vaccine to generate neutralizing
antibodies to the glycoprotein will be analyzed, as well as the production of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to gp62, TAX
and HBZ.
Aim 2: We aim to compare whether our vaccine can be used to prevent HTLV-1 transformation associated
disease. This approach will include establishing whether VSV-gp62-∆HT can prevent the establishment of HTLV-
1-assocated leukemia/lymphoma in NSG™-SGM3 mice. Our objectives are to collate sufficient information to
warrant the consideration of a variety of Phase I trials to prevent HTLV-1 -associated disease."

Movement depends on patterned spinal cord motor output necessary for coordinated muscle actions. This
in turn, depends on spinal interneuron microcircuits that modulate motoneuron recruitment and firing. The
recent explosion of genetically-defined interneurons has revolutionized the study of spinal motor circuits
promising a more comprehensive and complete dissection of these important networks. The work started
by devising genetic strategies to identify, label, study and modify activity of large groups of interneurons
defined by their derivation from specific progenitor domains. This is the approach mostly taken in previous
years. Much new information was obtained, but the biggest surprise was the large heterogeneity within
each domain-lineage of spinal interneurons. It is thus now necessary to study the different subclasses of
interneurons within each domain. This can only be accomplished with new animal models to target more
restricted subgroups using intersectional genetics in which combinatorial expression of more than one
gene is necessary for conditionally expressing fluorescent proteins or activity modulators to study them.
This grant focuses on the V1 group. These are inhibitory interneurons with ipsilateral connections in the
spinal cord and that have important roles shaping motoneuron activity. Over the years we and others have
reported a variety of functions for V1 interneurons, including control of motoneuron firing by recurrent and
reciprocal inhibition, being all Renshaw cells and some, but not all, Ia inhibitory interneurons (IaINs)
derived from V1s. They also contribute to regulate flexion-extension alternation during movement and
locomotion speed, providing respectively out-of-phase and in-phase inhibition during rhythmic locomotion.
This functional diversity is parallel by the existence of many different genetically-defined subpopulations
(by some estimates more than 50) organized into four major V1 clades. It is now important to analyze
whether each subset is integrated in distinct microcircuits and responsible for specialized functions. We
chose to focus in the next five years on the largest V1clade defined by the transcription factor Foxp2. Data
gathered during the previous grant suggest this group is composed of at least three major subtypes and
includes some cells with synaptology typical of IaINs. We have tested various intersectional strategies to
study anatomically (using various viral approaches) the connectivity of Foxp2-V1s with different motor
pools and primary afferents, and the postnatal development of these connections (Aim1). Then, we will
analyze whether Foxp2-V1s are the only sources of V1-IaINs and how reciprocal inhibition is affected by
genetically silencing them (Aim 2). Finally, we will reversibly silence these cells in the neonate and adult
during locomotor stepping and use chronic EMG recordings and kinematics to analyze their role in muscle
activation selection during rhythmic motor behaviors (Aim 3). The major goal is to uncover the functional
organization of this major V1 group and their impact during postnatal maturation of motor function."

Tick and rodent surveillance for pathogens requires substantial technical expertise and laboratory infrastructure.
Most surveillance activities focus on detection of one or two potential pathogens in the vector or reservoir
population and non-target pathogens remain undetected. To overcome the current limitations associated with
traditional tick surveillance methods, we are proposing a novel dual metagenomic and metatranscriptomic
sequencing solution using cutting-edge nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS) protocols. The NAS method leverages
Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing technology (a portable MinION sequencer) and a recently developed
bioinformatic pipeline that facilitates the immediate mapping of individual nucleotide molecules (DNA, cDNA,
or RNA) to a given reference as each molecule is sequenced. User-defined thresholds then specify the retention
or rejection of specific molecules, informed by the real-time reference mapping results as they are physically
passing through a given sequencing nanopore. Hundreds to thousands of individual sequencing pores are
controlled in real-time using a powerful Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and the NAS software with retain/reject
decisions made in less than a second for each individual pore. This allows for sensitive detection of a very wide
range of targeted pathogen and host species barcoding sequences without becoming swamped in the sea of non-
target host and symbiotic bacterial nucleic acids. The system can be field deployed and requires minimal
infrastructure. An internet connection is not required.
 In the course of this proposed study, we will test NAS for diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and
threshold of detection), test for detection of a variety of in vitro grown DNA and RNA-based pathogens,
differentiate closely related pathogen species and strains, develop and ground truth protocols for field testing on
wild ticks and rodents from a well-characterized region (Minnesota), and comprehensively field test the methods
and protocols in a region predicted to have the one of the highest densities of emerging rodent-associated
zoonoses in the US (central Kansas). We expect NAS to become an important and affordable tool with a wide
variety of surveillance applications."

Oral wound healing is characterized by rapid resolution of inflammation and minimal scarring. As it is a prime
example of ideal tissue regeneration, there is a growing interdisciplinary interest in studying the mechanisms of
oral wound healing. Fibroblasts play an essential role in this process and are also implicated in oral diseases
responsible for the global economic burden amounting to 442 billion dollars. Recent advances in connective
tissue biology have elucidated the importance of fibroblast heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of dermal fibrosis
and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the in vivo heterogeneity of oral fibroblasts and thereby a functional
significance of select fibroblast population during oral wound healing is poorly understood. Here, we found that
postnatal Prx1+ cells are found in mouse gingiva and express common markers of fibroblasts. Preliminary data
demonstrate that wounds enriched in Prx1+ cells heal faster with minimal inflammation compared to wounds
that lack these cells. Therefore we will test the overall hypothesis that Prx1+ cells represent distinct oral fibroblast
progenitors and are responsible for rapid tissue regeneration through a mechanism that involves resolution of
inflammation. Aim 1 will utilize an auto-transplantation approach and test the hypothesis that transplanted
Prx1+ cells contribute to accelerated oral wound healing by functioning as mesenchymal progenitors in vivo. Aim
2 will investigate if lineage specific ablation of Prx1+ cells delays wound healing by causing the failure to quickly
resolve inflammation in vivo, and explore mechanisms of immune cell modulation by Prx1+ fibroblasts in co-
culture assays. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell RNA-sequencing to compare transcriptomic profiles of
mesenchymal and leukocyte cell subtypes in Prx1+ enriched oral wounds to those in Prx1-poor wounds in mice.
Moreover, we will test if Prx1-equivalent cells are found in human gingiva by single cell sequencing and in situ
validation. Upon completion, the proposed studies are expected to reveal Prx1+ cells as pro-healing oral
fibroblast subset and provide a significant translational value by implicating the clinical utilization of connective
tissues or ex vivo stem cell therapy that are enriched with Prx1+ fibroblasts."
10800715,"Cerebellar disease makes ordinary movements extraordinarily difficult, often resulting in endpoint errors. For
example, damage to lobule VII of the vermis makes saccadic eye movements dysmetric. These symptoms have
suggested that the cerebellum monitors ongoing commands and adjusts them, particularly as the movement nears
the target. Yet, individual Purkinje cells (P-cells) have firing patterns that are modulated much longer than the
movement. Thus, it has been difficult to decode the activities of P-cells, and their downstream nucleus neurons,
with respect to computations that are necessary for control of movements.
 A key to this puzzle is that the inferior olive monitors the output of the cerebellum and returns to it
information that appears to encode error [1–4]. This input to the cerebellum organizes P-cells and nucleus neurons
into anatomical groups called micro-clusters [5–7]. Cells within a micro-cluster likely have a common feature: they
respond similarly to error. Through a collaboration between Shadmehr, Soetedjo, and Kojima, we used this idea to
show that in macaques, if P-cells were organized into groups based on their complex spike response to error, then
their simple spikes as a population produced a rate coding that predicted parameters of the ongoing movement
[8,9]. The result was a new idea: the fundamental computational unit in the cerebellum may not be an individual
cell, but a population of cells that share a common preference for error.
 Here, we propose that P-cells that respond similarly to error are part of a network that exhibits a special
property: within this network, the P-cells not only coordinate their firing rates, but also temporally align their
spikes, especially during the deceleration phase of movements. That is, P-cells transmit information to the nucleus
by modulating their firing rates, and synchronizing their spikes. In our hypothesis, P-cells combine disinhibition with
synchronization to signal when the movement should be stopped [10]. To pursue this idea, in 2016 we built a
marmoset lab, pioneered techniques to train the animals, and then used silicon probes to record from many
neurons simultaneously [10,11]. We then built new tools for precise temporal analysis of cerebellar spikes [12].
Here, we propose to record from P-cells, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), and nucleus neurons, use their error
response to organize cells into populations, and then quantify both firing rates and spike timing during movements.
 Our proposed experiments have the potential to produce simultaneous recordings of P-cells, MLIs, and
nucleus neurons, something that is unprecedented in primates. We will use this neurophysiological approach to
test the anatomical basis of our hypothesis, that the inferior olive organizes the cerebellum into cell-assemblies.
The data will allow us to determine whether the healthy cerebellum relies on synchronization to encode
information, shedding light on conditions such as dysmetria and tremor, pathologies that appear to arise not from
mis-modulation of P-cell firing rates, but rather disorganization of spike timing [13–16]."
10884180,"Project Summary/Abstract
Because infertility is a growing public health problem, it is imperative that we understand the
basic mechanisms and identify the genetic risk factors that give rise to this disease. The most
common genetic abnormality that causes miscarriage is aneuploidy, an embryo with an improper
number of chromosomes. Although increased risk of aneuploidy is strongly correlated with
increasing maternal age, significant variation exists in aneuploidy rates at any given age, making
age alone an inadequate biomarker for the risk of producing an aneuploid conception. Therefore,
we hypothesize that women who produce higher than average levels of preimplantation stage
aneuploidy at a given age possess causal variants in genes which predispose them to an early
risk of producing an aneuploid conception. To test this hypothesis, we will develop methods to
identify causal genes using low-coverage whole genome sequences obtained from blastocysts
that underwent preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A). PGT-A sequencing is
common for clinical care to guide single euploid embryo transfer, and therefore there is an
abundance of sequences to analyze. Success in method development will likely have far reaching
utility in enabling clinics to conduct their own genetics-based evaluations. Candidate genes
identified by PGT-A analysis in this project and from previously analyzed datasets will be rapidly
tested and validated for causation by using worm and fly model organisms. High-ranking
candidates, and candidates without model organism homologs, will undergo one final validation
pass in a mouse oocyte in vitro system, before creating mouse models that harbor the genetic
variant of interest for in vivo studies that are not possible to conduct in humans. These
approaches will shed light on the molecular mechanisms that control meiotic chromosome
segregation in female gametes. Ultimately, this study could lead to the identification of maternal
genetic markers for risk of producing an aneuploid conception and help avoid infertility by
empowering women with necessary and personalized information to better preserve their
individual fertility."

 Cilia play essential roles in human development and health. Ciliary ubiquity and diversity are reflected
in multi-symptom ciliopathies caused by ciliary defects. The clinical severity of ciliopathy gene mutations varies
between cell types and includes cystic kidney disease, neurological and skeletal defects, retinal degeneration,
situs inversus, and male infertility. While the same basic intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery constructs all
cilia and flagella, the mechanisms underlying ciliary specialization are poorly understood. For example, cilia
produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). Whether EV shedding is a general property of cilia or a specialized
feature of some cilia types is unknown. The functions of ciliary EVs and their contributions to ciliopathies are
also poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular mechanisms regulating ciliary
specialization, remodeling, plasticity, EV biogenesis, and EV functions. Cilia of the C. elegans inner labial-type
2 (IL2) neurons display several specializations: they have unique microtubule ultrastructure, specialized IFT,
and shed EVs. The IL2 ciliary transition zone (TZ) and axoneme is structurally plastic and remodels from one
structure to another during animal development: from a canonical 9+0 to non-canonical 6+0 structure. While
cilia and flagella share a 9-fold microtubule doublet symmetry, variations in microtubule numbers are observed
in nature. Renal primary cilia do not conform to the 9 + 0 paradigm. This developmental plasticity suggests that
some ciliary defects (ciliopathies) may be corrected at later times. Our hypothesis is supported by the recent
discovery that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is reversible, and that the kidney displays
structural plasticity. Our simple C. elegans model allows us to uncover mechanisms that regulate ciliary
remodeling and plasticity. We found that TZ remodeling requires IFT and the tubulin code – combinatorial use
of tubulin isotypes, glutamylation, and microtubule-associated proteins. Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies
(NPHP-RCs) are associated with defects in TZ-associated proteins. NPHP-RCs include nephronophthisis,
Meckel Gruber (MKS), Joubert (JBTS), and Senior-Løken syndromes. The clinical severity of loss of function of
NPHP-RC genes varies between cell and cilia types, thus it is imperative to understand ciliary and EV biology
in a variety of contexts. We will use C. elegans to identify mechanisms driving transition zone and axonemal
remodeling and plasticity in non-canonical primary cilia. Ciliary EV shedding is a conserved, yet little is known
about how and why cilia make EVs. We will test the hypotheses that ciliary remodeling and a non-canonical
structure impacts EV biogenesis and EV function."

This application builds on the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) and leverages its recently funded
extension, Great Smoky Mountains Study of Rural Aging (GSMS-RA) to improve our understanding of the
determinants of health inequalities in rural America. This new study, the Mid-Life Health Inequalities in the
Rural South: Risk and Resilience, augments data being collected (and already funded) for two GSMS-RA
samples in western North Carolina, one of Native Americans and the other of non-Hispanic Whites, that are in
their early 40s and currently reside in rural regions of Appalachia, with two new samples from the northeastern
part of the State, one of African Americans and the other of non-African Americans, ages of 30 and 55, that will
be recruited from rural Census tracts of the “Black Belt” region of the state. The Black Belt samples will be
recruited, consented and surveyed using the same 120-minute in-home assessment utilized in the GSMS-RA to
collect demographic and socioeconomic and attitudinal information, neurocognitive tasks (IQ, memory, attention,
and executive function), and biomeasure collection (i.e., height, weight, waist, blood pressure, pulmonary
function, bloodspots) (Aim 1). The Black Belt sample will also participate in the same 6-month Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA) every other week (13 times total), using protocols to measure within-person day-
to-day or week-to-week fluctuations in one's financial and social situations and/or mood, as these measurements
may affect individuals' risk/resilience related to mid-life health outcomes, and track geospatial movement using
GPS monitoring to assess activity space (Aim 2). For each of these 2 rural regions (Appalachia and Black Belt),
we will assemble contextual data from several existing data bases to construct measures of the health, economic
and social contexts of the localities in which participants in our 4 samples reside. The data from Aims 1 and 2
for these 4-sample/2 region samples will be used to analyze the causal linkages between person-specific and
contextual measures of risk and resilience factors for those health conditions (e.g., suicide, alcohol abuse,
cardiometabolic diseases) most associated with mid-life mortality (Aim 3). Multiple statistical methods, including
fixed effect, structural equation and multilevel models as well as instrumental variables methods will be used to
identify these causal linkages and their racial/ethnic and region differences. A distinctive feature of this analysis
will be to employ the within-person data collected under the EMA protocol to examine the role of instability of
socio-emotional, economic and social support as a unique contributor to those health conditions that result in
midlife mortality. Finally, this project will harmonize measures collected in this rural-based study with measures
in existing health/aging studies, disseminate the data collected through the National Archive of Computerized
Data on Aging and conduct interdisciplinary user workshops on these data to facilitate urban/rural national
comparisons of the study of health inequalities at midlife (Aim 4)."
10802187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Awareness with paralysis (AWP), or unintentional awareness, is memory recall during neuromuscular blockade
(NMB) and can cause catastrophic psychological harm. Our team recently demonstrated a prevalence of AWP
of 3.7% in mechanically ventilated emergency department (ED) patients, 25 times higher than that observed in
the operating room (OR). Therefore, there is significant rationale to examine AWP in the ED, where 300,000
patients are mechanically ventilated annually. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in up to 70% of
patients who experience AWP, and ~ 35% of all critically ill ventilated patients. However, it is unknown to what
degree mechanically ventilated ED patients develop PTSD symptoms. Further, though the overall experience
drives PTSD development, knowledge of patient-centered experiences that can be targeted to improve
outcome is lacking. Our long-term goal is to improve patient-centered outcomes in mechanically ventilated
patients along the ED-to-ICU interface with pragmatic and scalable interventions aimed at prevention.
To that end, the overall objective of this proposal is to conduct a pragmatic, stepped wedge cluster randomized
trial in five academic EDs. The central hypothesis is that by using nudges and defaults aimed at reducing ED
rocuronium use, the proportion of patients experiencing AWP will be significantly reduced. In addition, we
hypothesize that the psychological burden suffered by mechanically ventilated ED patients is high, and
modifiable targets can be identified with a mixed-methods approach. The scientific literature and our
preliminary data provide the rationale for conducting this study, and through completion of its aims we will
prevent an important threat to patient safety, and develop interventions to be tested in future trials in effort to
improve mental health outcomes in survivors going forward. The public health impact from this proposal
resides in the fact that it can be readily implemented broadly to prevent thousands of cases of AWP annually.
In addition, by targeting the ED and examining psychological outcomes through a patient-centered lens, our
results are expected to have a positive public health impact by elucidating the principal pathways of long-term
psychological sequelae of critical illness and clarifying the role of time-sensitive ED interventions in contributing
to those outcomes. This will allow us to develop specific, targeted countermeasures to improve long-term
outcomes for critical illness survivors and identify promising prevention strategies for ED implementation."

Despite intensive treatments that often combine surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, patients with head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), including oral cavity and esophageal squamous cell
carcinomas (OCSCCs & ESCCs), have a long-term survival rate of only 15-40%. Among the reasons for the
poor prognoses are that many of these cancers are diagnosed at late stages. Furthermore, “field
cancerization” leads to high rates of primary site recurrences. Even after initial surgery/radiotherapy for
treatment, patients are at a very high risk for recurrence. Metastases to regional lymph nodes also occur
with high frequency. Thus, there is a great need for improvements in both cancer prevention and treatment
regimens for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). The retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ) acts
as a tumor suppressor in stratified squamous epithelial cells of the skin, a very similar type of stratified
squamous epithelium to the oral cavity. Moreover, we have shown that a retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ)
selective agonist, CD1530, can substantively reduce the numbers of carcinomas that develop in a murine
model of oral cavity carcinogenesis. Thus, CD1530 acts as a cancer chemopreventive drug in this model.
Our hypothesis, which is based on both our published work and new, preliminary data, is that this selective,
retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ) agonist is effective in oral cancer prevention because by changing the
transcriptional profile of the oral cavity stem/progenitor cells, CD1530 enhances the ability of stem cells
to generate daughter cells destined to differentiate rather than to proliferate. To test this hypothesis we
will carry out the following aims: Specific Aim (1): To determine how this RARγ selective agonist,
CD1530, affects the proliferation and differentiation properties of the stem/progenitor cells in the pre-
malignant state in the carcinogen treated mice: a) we will perform advanced lineage tracing on
transgenic mice to delineate the pharmacological actions of CD1530 on the stem/progenitor cells of the
oral epithelium; and b) we will define how CD1530 acts on human oral epithelial stem/progenitor cells
using a 3D air:liquid culture system. Specific Aim (2): We will perform similar experiments on mice
with RARγ specifically knocked out in the stem/progenitor cells of the oral cavity epithelium to assess
the function of RARγ as a tumor suppressor and the selectivity of the CD1530 ligand for RARγ. Our
goal is to improve cancer prevention approaches for human OCSCCs and to reduce the high frequency of
relapse, reducing both mortality and morbidity. Here we will identify the pharmacological mechanism(s)
of our novel cancer prevention therapy. We will additionally be able to test critically the idea that RARγ in
vivo is indeed the pharmacological target for therapy with CD1530."
10810816,"Abstract: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the United States is increasing in prevalence (e.g. 4.8% per
year between 2002 and 2015, and its phenotype is distinct from adult-onset T2DM in that it is accompanied by
a greater degree of insulin resistance, more rapid deterioration of β-cell function, and earlier onset of life-
threatening complications. These findings suggest the personal and societal costs of youth-onset T2D will be
substantially greater than in adult-onset disease. The reasons for the more severe phenotype of youth-onset
T2D are unclear and require further investigation. In order to develop therapeutic targets to delay, decrease the
severity of, or prevent T2DM in youth, a more accurate predictive model is needed. This can only be
determined through a prospective cohort study of youth at high risk for T2DM to identify characteristics or
biomarkers of who progresses most rapidly. This will allow us to evaluate putative risk factors including:
genetic factors, psychosocial and environmental factors, inflammation, and other sources of beta cell failure.
Soluble receptors of Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) have been associated with insulin resistance
and β-cell dysfunction in adults with T2D. However, the AGE/RAGE axis has not been well researched in
youth-onset T2D. Its potential role in the more rapid β-cell failure and increased rate of complications
characteristic of youth-onset T2D warrants investigation. There is also mounting evidence of an association
between exposure to metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDC) and obesity, insulin resistance, and β-cell
dysfunction. Of note, MDC exposures disproportionately affect certain populations, including Black, Latinx, and
low-income communities, mirroring the populations most affected by T2D. Non-chemical environmental
exposures and psychosocial functioning also modify disease risk, including the built environment, social
environment, and lifestyle/food environment. We propose to use remote data collection and ecological
assessments as novel ways to track environmental exposures. We propose that the interaction of these
internal and external exposures is responsible for the development of youth-onset T2D.The NYU Clinical
Center team brings considerable expertise in engaging children and their families in longitudinal studies,
scientific and clinical expertise to develop the final protocol, and a process for stakeholder engagement, used
to develop our proposal, and which can be utilized in finalizing the study protocol. NYU Langone Health is an
integrated system that will use its main hospitals and practices with a diverse group of over 11,500 youth with a
BMI >95th %ile between the ages of 7-14 in our care to screen for this study. We will collaborate with the
Consortium and key stakeholders to design and implement the study protocol; and suggest novel targets for
evaluation, such as the AGE/RAGE axis, in the context of other factors including: social determinants of health,
physical activity, food choices, depression, and MDC exposures on the progression of insulin resistance, β-cell
failure, and the development of youth-onset T2D."
10863867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 90,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are diagnosed with cancer yearly in the United
States. AYAs with cancer experience multiple co-occurring and related symptoms from their disease and
treatment that adversely affect their day-to-day lives and are difficult to self-manage. Because undermanaged
symptoms reduce quality of life and increase symptom severity and distress, effective person-centered
symptom self-management (SS-M) is imperative for AYAs with cancer. A major barrier, however, is a lack of
effective symptom self-management interventions that are tailored to this population. The proposed study
addresses this gap by testing an intervention designed to improve SS-M behaviors in AYAs with cancer who
are in active treatment. The Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT) is an intervention that uses a
heuristics approach to promote AYAs’ self-awareness and insight about themselves and their symptoms and
help them visualize the ‘big picture’ of their unique symptom experience. This use of heuristics contrasts with
typical checklist approaches to symptom assessment which do not incorporate the patient’s perspective to
identify symptoms of high priority, defined as the symptoms that are most important to them, and
interrelationships among symptoms. The C-SCAT also facilitates AYAs in discussing the symptom issues that
are of greatest importance to them with a clinician and jointly developing an effective plan for SS-M. This study
is a two-group multi-site randomized controlled trial in which 126 AYAs with cancer in active treatment will be
randomly assigned to the C-SCAT intervention group or usual care control group. The specific aims are to: 1)
Determine the effects of the C-SCAT versus usual care on the primary outcomes of self-efficacy for symptom
management and symptom self-management behaviors immediately post intervention (Time 1) and at follow-
up one month later (Time 2); 2) Examine the effects of the C-SCAT versus usual care on secondary outcomes
(symptom severity, symptom distress, social function, and satisfaction with social function) immediately post
intervention (Time 1) and at follow-up one month later (Time 2); and 3) Explore the relationships of individual
factors and social determinants of health with self-efficacy for symptom management and symptom self-
management behaviors at baseline (Time 0).The long-term goal of this research is to mitigate the symptoms
that AYAs experience during cancer treatment by supporting symptom self-management. If shown to be
effective, the C-SCAT could be incorporated into clinical settings and possibly into the electronic health record
as an efficient, low-cost approach to improve symptom self-management."

Influenza virus evolves in response to pressure from herd immunity, resulting in progressive variation
of viral antigenicity and limiting vaccine efficacy. The goal of this Program project is to establish a
secure mechanistic foundation for novel vaccination strategies that might confer long-lasting immunity
in face of rapid antigenic variation of currently circulating subtypes and in anticipation of potential
introduction of zoonotic subtypes into the human population. The breadth of expertise in our four
collaborative Projects and three scientific Cores and Results from the current and previous grant
cycles allow us to pursue the following Specific Aims. (1) Can a suitable vaccination strategy modify
or redirect immune ""imprinting"" -- the observed influence of an individual's history of infection of
vaccination on their response to an antigenically drifted strain or novel subtype? We will determine
the full scope of the human humoral response to vaccination in individuals of all ages (infants to
seniors) and hence of varying exposures, and we will carry out, in non-human primates (NHPs),
experiments to compare imprinting by infection and vaccination. (2) We have found (in mice) a strong
effect of the anatomical location of immunization with protein antigen on the response to a subsequent
immunization. We will determine whether this effect extends to infection and whether it is also true in
NHPs. Experiments in mice will determine whether components of TFH cell memory are similarly
localized and test the contribution of conserved T-cell epitopes to humoral imprinting. (3) We will
design novel vaccine antigens to extend previous studies of human immune responses (focused on
hemagglutinin) to influenza neuraminidase (NA) and to determine the importance of T-cell epitope
diversity for design of optimized immunogens. We will also create a model for co-evolution of virus
(immune escape) and humoral immunity (antibody affinity maturation) using directed molecular
evolution in the laboratory."
10771164,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of alcohol addiction is increasingly viewed as involving transition from controlled and
regulated consumption to uncontrolled drinking characterized as compulsive and habitual. Recent studies in
human alcoholics and animal models have suggested that chronic alcohol exposure may induce
neurobiological changes in corticostriatal circuits. These changes may underlie deficits in the ability to engage
goal-directed processes that normally function to suppress habitual actions. Consistent with this, evidence also
indicates that addiction is associated with an inability of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to exert appropriate
inhibitory control over drug-taking and drug-seeking behaviors. Support for this comes from human imaging
studies that reveal alterations in prefrontal cortex and striatal brain regions in individuals with alcohol use
disorder (AUD) as compared to controls. Published and unpublished preliminary data further demonstrate that
chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure can facilitate the transition from flexible goal-directed drinking to
inflexible habitual drinking. Our preliminary data in mice demonstrates that CIE-induced facilitation of habitual
responding for alcohol can be reversed by chemogenetic inactivation of the infralimbic (IfL) cortex, a sub-region
of the mPFC that is roughly equivalent to the ventromedial PFC of humans. The overarching hypothesis of
this ARC research project is that repeated cycles of CIE exposure facilitates the expression of habitual
responding for alcohol, and that changes in activity of specific ensembles of neurons in the mPFC
plays a critical role in this process. It is further hypothesized that compromised dopamine (DA) modulation
of prefrontal function contributes to this CIE-induced transition to habitual drinking. The following three specific
aims will test this overarching hypothesis in the ARC mouse model of dependence-induced excessive, habit-
like drinking: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that dependence-induced facilitation of habitual responding for
alcohol is associated with changes in population activity and network organization in the IfL cortex. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that DA D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the IfL cortex modulate dependence-
induced facilitation of the expression of habitual responding for alcohol. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
dependence-induced facilitation of habitual responding for alcohol is associated with alterations in the
biophysical properties of DA D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the IfL cortex. Together, these studies
will address the gap in our knowledge concerning the differential role of PFC-striatal subcircuits in the transition
from flexible goal-directed to inflexible habitual drinking, and will identify novel therapeutic targets for more
effective treatment of AUD."
10771173,"SUMMARY
With advances in opto-/chemo-genetic stimulation techniques, preclinical studies have demonstrated that activity
in frontal-striatal neural circuits has a causal influence on heavy alcohol drinking and relapse-like behavior.
Similar findings using modern fMRI imaging techniques in humans have confirmed some of these findings.
Clinically, however, we have not yet translated this research into a neural circuit based therapeutic technique for
patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). The long term goal of our multidisciplinary research team is to
determine the optimal parameters through which non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be
used to improve alcohol drinking outcomes (abstinence, heavy drinking days) among individuals seeking
behavioral treatment for AUD. Building on a foundation of several TMS brain target identification studies and a
small double-blinded clinical trial in treatment-engaged AUD patients performed by our group in the Charleston
Alcohol Research Center (ARC), here we propose a double-blind placebo controlled, randomized study to
evaluate the efficacy of theta burst stimulation (TBS) to ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) as a treatment
to decrease drinking and brain reactivity to alcohol cues among treatment-seeking individuals with AUD.
Individuals will be screened initially by the ARC Clinical Intake and Assessment Core, then given an opportunity
to enroll in this study, provide informed consent, and be randomized to receive real or sham TBS to the vmPFC
36 sessions (3x/day on each of 3 days/week over 4 weeks, i.e., 12 days). Prior to randomization and again after
4 weeks of TBS treatment, they will receive a well-established and validated alcohol-cue stimulation BOLD fMRI
procedure. The scientific premise of this ARC research proposal is that, by modulating the neural circuits that
regulate alcohol cue-reactivity, it will be possible to increase alcohol abstinence rates and decrease heavy
drinking days over a 4-month period. Accordingly, we will explore the relationship of TBS-induced changes in
brain reactivity to alcohol cues as mediators of the TBS treatment response. Also, brain activation to natural
reward and threat cues will be studies as a means to probe potential effects of TBS treatment on negative
affect/emotionality associated with AUD. With our combined scientific expertise in brain stimulation,
neuroimaging, clinical (and preclinical) alcohol-related research in the Charleston ARC, and AUD clinical trial
expertise, MUSC is uniquely suited to develop this critical line of research. The outcomes of the proposed Aims
will provide an evidence-based foundation for a multisite clinical trial and will hasten progress towards developing
a new neural circuit-based treatment for individuals with AUD."
10771181,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excessive, uncontrolled alcohol consumption is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with alcohol use disorder
(AUD). Chronic alcohol drinking produces neuroadaptations in corticothalamic and corticostriatal circuits that
may reduce behavioral flexibility and diminish engagement in behaviors for non-alcohol rewards. While deficits
in executive cognitive functioning in individuals with AUD hinder treatment and lead to relapse, the mechanisms
and neural circuits driving excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-biased choice behaviors represent a
substantial gap in our understanding of factors that lead to the development and maintenance of AUD. The
mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) is a higher-order thalamic nucleus that integrates cortical and subcortical signaling
via its reciprocal glutamatergic projections with the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. The MDT is innervated by
reward-processing mesolimbic structures and contributes to adaptive goal-directed choice behavior and higher-
order cognitive flexibility. However, it is unknown if the MDT is a critical region in addiction-related circuitry
involving PFC dysfunction and alcohol-biased choice behaviors. In alcoholics, the pathway between the MDT
and medial PFC is degenerated, and our preliminary data demonstrates that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE)
exposure increases intrinsic excitability of MDT projection neurons. Moreover, we provide evidence that
voluntary alcohol drinking in FosTRAP2 mice activates cells in the MDT and chemogenetic activation of the MDT
reduces alcohol intake. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this research project in the Charleston Alcohol
Research Center (ARC) is that cortical-projecting MDT neurons drive excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-
biased choice behaviors. In Aim 1, we will identify neural ensembles and characterize functional adaptations in
MDT neurons that are activated by alcohol drinking and CIE exposure, and project to the infralimbic (IfL) cortex,
a region that controls excessive alcohol intake. Studies in Aim 2 will use fiber photometry to test the hypothesis
that activity of MDT→IfL neurons will be modulated by alcohol drinking and this pattern of activity will be altered
in alcohol-dependent mice. In Aim 3, studies will test the hypothesis that MDT→IfL projecting neurons drive
excessive drinking and alcohol-biased choice behaviors in dependent mice. The results from this project using
emerging technology and circuit-based approaches will identify specific subsets of neural populations in the MDT
that are activated by excessive alcohol drinking in dependent mice. Collectively, the proposed research will
identify unique functional signatures and novel neurocircuits that control heavy drinking and contribute to loss of
reward-based flexible behaviors. The focus of this new Charleston ARC project on thalamocortical projections
and alcohol-biased choice behaviors complements the overarching theme and overlaps extensively on
conceptual, technical, and circuitry levels with the other basic science and clinical projects in this Center renewal."
10757924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Broad recognition of a diversity gap in genomic datasets has fueled calls for targeted recruitment and retention
of individuals from populations that have historically not participated in biomedical research. Yet, definitions of
what constitutes diversity, according to whom, and how best to implement goals of inclusion remain elusive.
Precision medicine research (PMR) is a significant and consequential sphere of scientific inquiry where
questions about the meanings and effects of diversity are being worked out in practice and increasingly
institutionalized. Approaches to increasing diversity and inclusion of racial and ethnic minority populations in
precision medicine research are heterogeneous, but little is known about their impact. To fill this gap, we have
embarked on three studies that empirically examine different stakeholder perspectives and experiences with
PMR and its varied approaches to enhancing diversity and inclusion of underrepresented populations as
research participants. This project will synthesize data and findings from across these studies, to develop what
will be the first book-length analysis of diversity in practice in PMR, and its consequences for meaningful
inclusion. The specific aim of this grant application is to complete a book manuscript that will examine the
ethical and social dimensions of concepts of diversity and inclusion, how they are put into practice by
stakeholders in precision medicine research, and their impacts for our understandings of health and human
variation. The data to be included in this book come from three NIH-funded studies led by the co-authors that
include focus groups with racially and ethnically diverse patients to assess their attitudes towards the use and
governance of clinical data and samples; a review of documents related to three NIH-funded PMR consortia
and 5 PMR research sites; observations of PMR consortia and site activities; and in-depth interviews with PMR
funders, researchers, participants, and individuals from diverse populations being recruited for PMR. Such a
book will offer an empirically informed, ethnographically rich analysis and reflection on how PMR diversity
practices are unfolding, and with what consequences for the populations it seeks to serve and for the larger
society in which it is embedded and helps to shape. The target audiences for this book include: researchers
who conduct genomics and precision medicine research, policymakers and research funders, research
institutions and research staff, commercial entities involved in biomedical research, scholars in bioethics,
sociology and anthropology, science and technology studies, and health policy, and members of the general
public with interests in health, genetics, and biomedical research."
10806240,"Identifying Associations between Brain Iron, Neurocognitive Networks and
Protective Factors
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves accumulation of pathological levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ)
and phospho-tau proteins. However, a significant proportion of individuals with AD pathology
do not have clinical AD, indicating contributions of other factors. Novel in-vivo measures are
required to track other factors contributing to AD-related cognitive declines. Increasing
evidence suggests that age-related accumulation of brain iron and its correlates contribute to
the manifestation of memory declines. Our recent neuroimaging results suggest that high
brain iron concentration, measured with in vivo quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), is
associated poor connectivity within brain memory networks. This proposal seeks to identify
associations between QSM-based iron concentration and neurocognitive changes toward a
goal of improving AD biomarkers. We will also define the interplay between QSM-based iron
signal, AD pathology, inflammatory markers on cognitive declines. Finally, we will test the
possibility that brain iron accumulation may be slowed by an antioxidant rich diet. We
propose to study 140 healthy older adults using neuroimaging measures including fMRI and
QSM, measures of CSF and plasma Aβ, p-tau and t-tau and inflammatory markers.
Additional structural neuroimaging measures will include regional volumes, FLAIR imaging
for quantification of WMH volumes and diffusion tensor imaging for quantification of
regionally distributed white matter connectivity. A subset of participants will be complete the
same CSF and imaging measures approximately 3 years later. We aim to identify (1) effects
of QSM-based iron signal on functional and structural brain networks supporting cognition;
(2) associations between brain iron, inflammatory markers, AD pathology and cognitive
declines and; (3) modifiers of brain iron or its effects on cognition. We will test hypotheses
that high QSM-based brain iron is associated with low connectivity in memory circuits
independently of AD pathology but may and synergistically interacts with AD over time. We
will also test the hypothesis that reserve factors will offset the effects of brain iron on
cognitive functions via mechanisms of brain maintenance or plastic functional brain
reorganization of large-scale brain functional networks in some older adults."
10817939,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Current therapies remain
unsuccessful in improving overall survival; thus, the identification of novel therapies for GBM is critical. We have
pioneered a novel, targeted immunotoxin (IT)-based cytotoxic therapy, D2C7-IT, that targets epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII), established driver oncogenes of GBM. In
preclinical studies, D2C7-IT targets and kills a substantial number of tumor cells and prolongs survival but is
unable to generate cures in all treated animals because of the presence of a highly immunosuppressive GBM
microenvironment. The majority of the immune cells in the GBM microenvironment are tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs), which promote tumor cell growth and inhibit antitumor T cell responses. Therefore,
eliminating TAM-mediated immunosuppression is anticipated to enhance D2C7-IT-induced antitumor immune
responses. CD40 is an immune co-stimulatory molecule whose activation is known to re-educate TAMs, and
also induce T cell responses. Thus, the central hypothesis driving the present proposal is that overcoming
TAM immunosuppression and tumor-promoting activities via CD40 co-stimulation will improve the
efficacy of the cytotoxic D2C7-IT therapy. Accordingly, our preliminary studies have demonstrated that (1) in
a mouse glioma model, D2C7-IT+αCD40 functions synergistically to prolong survival and generate significant
cures, (2) brain resident microglia is the principal antigen-presenting cells (APCs) activated by the combination
therapy, and (3) αCD40 treatment engages CD8+ effector T cells that are antitumorigenic only when combined
with cytotoxic D2C7-IT. Our results strongly imply that αCD40 alters either the development or activity of TAMs
in GBM and activates microglia/T cells. Demonstrating the antitumor efficacy of the D2C7-IT+αCD40 therapy in
relevant brain tumor models and gaining insights into their mechanism of action will greatly aid in the clinical
translation of D2C7-IT+αCD40 therapy. Therefore, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to characterize
D2C7-IT+αCD40 antitumor efficacy, TAM re-education, and microglia/T cell activation mechanisms: Aim 1:
Evaluate whether αCD40 overcomes TAM immunosuppression and enhances D2C7-IT efficacy in two preclinical
immunocompetent glioma models. Aim 2: Define whether microglial CD40/MHCII molecules are the mediators
of D2C7-IT+αCD40 antitumor immune response. Aim 3: Determine whether D2C7-IT+αCD40 therapy stimulates
CD8+ effector T cell response capable of eliminating antigen-positive as well as antigen-negative tumors. The
proposed research is significant because it will result in the development of a therapeutic strategy for
simultaneous tumor cell killing, reversal of TAM immunosuppression, activation of microglia and T cells, and
ultimately could be translated and tested in the clinic."

The proportion of African-, Black- and Hispanic- and Latino- Americans (UR) in the U.S. population increased
from 24.8% to 30.6% (1.23 fold) between 2000 and 2014. However, from 2006 to 2016, the proportion of awarded
STEM PhDs was abysmally low, (5% to 7% of total), for the same groups and remained below 1% for Native
Americans. Workforce diversity brings a diversity of ideas, experience and productive interactions, accelerating
creative problem-solving. Importantly, an increasingly diverse workforce is also urgently needed to address the
increasing diversity and complexity of health issues. Therefore, the STAR-PREP program at University of
Maryland Baltimore (UMB) was recently created to provide rigorous, integrated and comprehensive academic
and research training to prepare UR to ascend to quality PhD or MD-PhD programs to meet the urgent workforce
diversity need. Our underlying prediction for the program was that this multidimensional program would result in
at least 75% of participating students enrolling in rigorous and high-quality PhD or MD-PhD programs. Indeed,
in just 3 years, a 77% ascension rate to quality PhD or MD-PhD programs was achieved. Students were
prepared by immersion in rigorous programing, including graduate academic and enrollment-preparation
courses, activities and workshops which were guided by comprehensive, individualized development plans (IDP)
and frequent cohort assessments and evaluations. We learned that the students wanted and needed research,
academic and also emotional preparation for the rigors of graduate school. Multiple levels and channels of
engagement were created to meet this need, resulting in building of trust and the scholars and excitement in the
UMB academic community to host, challenge, nurture and support the students in collaboratively-, culturally-,
contextually- and experientially-informed capacities. This renewal application builds on the successes of the first
funding period and incorporates best practices from lessons learned to test our current outcome predictions that
student preparedness and institutional cultural impact will make programs and mentors much more receptive
and accepting of UR scholars and vice versa, which will lead to greater scholar integration, better scholar
performance and ultimately to increased MD- STEM-PhD and STEM-PhD enrollment and graduation. We
propose a bold and innovative STAR-PREP program that builds on successes and lessons learned, to pursue
the following aims: Aim 1), We will maximize student academic and research preparedness through intense lab
and graduate course experiences, Aim 2), We will strengthen and prepare the scholars holistically
(academically, mentally, emotionally) for the rigors of graduate school through courses and professional
development activities. Aim 3), We will use the STAR-PREP model to widen its impact to collaboratively shape
the culture and expectations of the higher-learning institution to receive and nurture UR scholars. These aims
will be pursued while maintaining the 75%/25% balance in research and development activities, respectively and
the program will continue to deliver a 75% of better ascension rate to high quality MD-PhD and PhD programs."

 Disruption of cellular neutral lipid metabolism promotes the progression of obesity, diabetes, fatty liver
disease, and cancer. The long-term scientific goal of the project is to understand the molecular mechanisms
that control lipid storage and mobilization in order to identify novel points for therapeutic intervention.
 ABHD5 regulates cellular lipid metabolism, including PNPLA2/ATGL, the rate-limiting triglyceride lipase
in key metabolic tissues. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which ABHD5, a protein lacking enzymatic activity,
activates PNPLA2 (and other PNPLAs) remains an important mystery.
 We hypothesize that the remodeling of biological membranes is a general mechanism by which ABHD5
regulates enzyme access to membrane-delimited neutral lipid substrates. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that
ligand binding stabilizes ABHD5 molecular and macromolecular conformations that target and alter membrane
biophysical properties (tension and curvature) to allow the lipase access to specific substrates sequestered
within lipid droplets (LDs). We will test this hypothesis using novel chemical probes of ABHD5 and informative
genetic mutants in live adipocytes (Aim 1). We will directly assess the impact ABHD5 on the biophysical
properties of membranes in model LD systems using an array of high resolution and high throughput
approaches (Aim 2). These Aims are designed to be highly complementary and to provide strong cross-
validation between experimental platforms.
 In addition, we present data demonstrating that ABHD5 is targeted to specific subcellular sites where
LDs form upon fatty acid supplementation. Furthermore, the interaction of ABHD5 with PLIN5, driven by the
ABHD5 ligand oleoyl-CoA, facilitates LD formation. Aim 3 will dissect the biochemical pathways promoted by
ABHD5/PLIN5 complexes and, in concert with Aim 2, evaluate the impact of this interaction on the biophysical
properties of model membranes.
 ABHD5 is emerging as a compelling therapeutic target for metabolic diseases and cancer. The results
of this project will provide new insights into specific mechanisms by which ABHD5 regulates fatty acid flux at
the cytosol/LD interface."
10789989,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Globally, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality. Prematurity is also on the rise in the U.S., with
9.93% of infants born preterm in 2017. This resulted in 382,851preterm births, more than 25,800 of whom were
born before 28 weeks' gestation. This group, also known as extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs),
is at a significant risk for poor outcomes; mortality in ELGANs is 10-20%, and up to 50% of survivors will have
moderate or severe neurocognitive deficits in childhood. Preterm birth is commonly initiated by maternal infection
or inflammation, and is often associated with additional perinatal insults including oxidative injury due to
fluctuating hypoxia, hyperoxia, as well as ischemia and hypotension. These insults contribute to significant long-
term neurodevelopmental impairment, which has remained essentially unchanged over the past decades. New
approaches to treating the injured premature brain that improve outcomes and reduce long-term morbidity in
ELGANs therefore remains a significant unmet clinical need. Azithromycin (AZ) is a macrolide antibiotic
commonly prescribed to treat community-based infections. It is easy to administer, safe to use in pregnant
women, and crosses both the placenta and blood brain barrier. AZ accumulates in phagocytes, providing a form
of targeted drug delivery as phagocytes migrate to the site of infection or inflammation. AZ has anti-inflammatory
effects, particularly modulating macrophages and microglia to a less inflammatory or injurious phenotype. This
results in significant neuroprotection in experimental rodent models of stroke, spinal cord injury, and hypoxic-
ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats. AZ is an attractive neuroprotectant as it is FDA approved, inexpensive,
and safe. If it were to be found effective, it could be used in both high and low resource settings to improve
outcomes of premature brain injury. The overarching objective of this proposal is to determine whether AZ
provides long-term neuroprotection in a ferret model of inflammation-sensitized brain injury in ELGANs.
Unlike the rodent, the ferret has a gyrified brain that is very similar to the human brain in terms of both
development and structure. It is also amenable to long-term behavioral testing and complex imaging, making it
ideal for investigating the short- and long-term effects of premature brain injury. The first aim will evaluate how
AZ alters inflammation and oxidative stress, including microglial phenotype, in organotypic brain slices taken
from the P12 ferret (26-28 weeks' gestation-equivalent). The second aim will examine the pharmacokinetics and
short-term neuroprotective effects of single versus multiple doses of AZ in a P12 ferret model of inflammation-
sensitized hypoxic-ischemic/hyperoxic (HIH) premature brain injury developed in our laboratory. The third aim
will then examine the long-term effects of AZ treatment in the ferret HIH model, including behavioral outcomes,
MRI, immunohistochemistry, and microglial phenotyping. Successful completion of the aims could support a
clinical trial in this at-risk population for which no specific neuroprotective therapies are currently available."
10783752,"Aging is a primary risk factor for development of cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. The hallmarks
of vascular aging are endothelial dysfunction, development of a synthetic, atherosclerotic phenotype in
smooth muscle, and arterial inflammation and stiffening. We have shown that aerobic exercise training
can mitigate or reverse age-related vascular dysfunction and adverse arterial remodeling; however, the
cellular signals that contribute to the ability of exercise training to promote macro- and microvascular
resiliency remain unidentified. Similarly, the mechanisms whereby exercise training reverses age-
related vascular dysfunction remain unknown. Reduced circulating adiponectin has been associated with
the adverse vascular changes that occur with advancing age; however, a role for adiponectin in age-
related vascular dysfunction has not been demonstrated. We have reported that circulating adiponectin
levels increase in response to late-life exercise training; however, a direct role for adiponectin signaling
in reversal of age-related vascular dysfunction by exercise training has not been demonstrated. We
propose to test a central hypothesis that 1) loss of adiponectin is a critical contributor to age-
related vascular dysfunction and adverse arterial remodeling, and 2) adiponectin contributes to
the ability of exercise training to promote vascular resiliency and reverse age-related vascular
dysfunction and age-related adverse vascular remodeling. We propose to study sedentary and
exercise trained mice, across the murine lifespan, to determine 1) the impact of loss- and gain-of-function
of adiponectin on ceramide/sphingosine signaling in the endothelium of the microvasculature of the heart
and skeletal muscle, 2) the impact of loss- and gain-of-function of adiponectin on development of a
senescence-associated synthetic phenotype in vascular smooth muscle and contractile dysfunction the
microvasculature of the heart and skeletal muscle, and 3) the impact of loss- and gain-of-function of
adiponectin on remodeling of large arteries. Results from the proposed work will increase our
understanding of the role of adiponectin in age-related vascular dysfunction and exercise training-induced
reversal of age-related vascular dysfunction. A top biomedical research priority is to identify strategies
which promote vascular resiliency with advancing age or which reverse age-related vascular dysfunction.
The proposed work could identify 1) components of the adiponectin signaling pathway that could be
targeted for prevention of age-related vascular dysfunction, and 2) novel exercise mimetics that could be
employed for 1) promotion of vascular resiliency across the lifespan, and/or 2) reversal of age-related

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurs in 1 in 54 US children and often features hearing impairments such as
hyperacusis, auditory processing disorders and sensorineural hearing loss, along with difficulties in social
communication. The Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Neurodevelopment and its Disorders (CNDD)
supports the cross-cutting, innovative research needed to advance fundamental understanding of the unique
hearing impairments and pathophysiology of the auditory system in ASD and their role in social communication.
This research studies the role of the peripheral auditory system in the development of hearing impairments and
ASD-like behaviors in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenetic type of
ASD. We hypothesize that hearing impairments in FXS are due in part to defects in the cochlea and to
dysfunction in both neuronal and non-neuronal Fmr1-expressing cells including sensory hair cells, but also other
nonsensory cells in the inner ear. Aim 1 tests methods to rescue hearing function and mitigate related ASD-like
behaviors in the developing Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse and Aim 2 investigates the pathophysiological changes
in cellular composition and cell type-specific gene expression patterns in the Fmr1 KO cochlea by single nucleus
RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). Our findings could provide (1) new evidence about the role of peripheral sensory deficits
in ASD-related symptoms, (2) critical new insights into the role of neuronal vs. non-neuronal FMRP functions in
cochlear development and auditory function and (3) test a gene therapeutic approach to possibly rescue auditory
function and/or reduce communication-related symptoms of ASD. To understand how gene networks in the
peripheral auditory system are deregulated in ASD, this research uses omics approaches for systematic mapping
of complex genetic networks. Study of the fundamental processes that contribute to hearing differences in ASD
could identify therapeutic strategies to resolve hearing differences and related language and social
communication challenges. Critical components of the CNDD for this project are cores for neurobehavioral
phenotyping, in vivo imaging, and bioinformatics, advanced biostatistical consulting, and also significant
resources for research capacity and training including career development mentorship and tools for
advancement to independence and success in obtaining R01-level funding to continue research in the
pathophysiology of the auditory system in ASD."

Aberrant secondary immune activity after brain injury during neonatal life affects critical phases of brain
development, with long-lasting behavioral abnormalities relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders. The most
common form of brain injury in the preterm neonate is germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH), which may display
pathophysiological alterations relating to risk factors for atypical brain development. However, very little is known
about how an aberrant secondary immune response that occurs and persists in the higher-order cortical and
limbic regions of the developing brain following GMH leads to failure of compensatory synaptic and neuronal
mechanisms and contributes to behavioral abnormalities. Recent studies have revealed a central role for
complement in serving as a local immune recognition mechanism that promotes secondary injury after brain
injury. Our preliminary data indicate a similar role for complement in propagating the pathogenic sequelae of
GMH. Using a mouse model of GMH, we will investigate how complement dependent neuroinflammation in the
neonatal brain following injury leads to failure of compensatory synaptic and neuronal mechanisms in primary
cognitive centers of the brain. We will determine how complement activation impacts long-term behavioral
changes relevant to neurodevelopment disorders, and we will investigate complement inhibition as a potential
therapeutic approach to mitigate the pathogenic sequelae of GMH. Additionally, we will investigate the role of
aberrant neuron/synapse elimination in the propagation of secondary brain injury, and specifically investigate a
role for complement opsonin-complement receptor interactions in this process. The CNDD will provide me with
critical support for the project through access to CNDD Cores and financial resources to support the research
efforts, and the career development and mentoring activities will ensure future success in obtaining an NIH R01

10783025,"The selectivity of orthosteric drugs is often limited by the structural similarity of their binding sites in homologous
proteins, while allosteric binding sites are far less conserved. This allows allosteric drugs to bind a target protein
with higher selectivity, which reduces the potential for side-effects and lowers drug toxicity. However, allosteric
drug discoveries have been limited to serendipitous observations because rational allosteric drug design
strategies face several inherent challenges. These challenges are directly related to current limits in the
predictability of protein conformational fluctuations and collective dynamics that are central to the mechanisms
of allosteric drugs. The objective of this project is the development of computational methods to facilitate the
rational design of allosteric drugs via predictions of protein conformational fluctuations and collective dynamics
from all-atom simulations.
In principle, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can directly explore protein conformational dynamics but
require sampling on timescales of milliseconds to seconds for systems of pharmacological interest. Even with
state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques, the associated computational costs and hardware requirements
(special purpose computers, national supercomputers, large distributed computing networks) limit such
applications to a small number of systems. This project aims to make the computational discovery of allosteric
mechanisms in proteins more efficient and achievable with computer hardware available in most research
laboratories and universities. To this end, the methods developed for this project maximize the information on
inherent protein dynamics that can be extracted from molecular dynamics simulations.
These methods will initially be applied to identify allosteric mechanisms in matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs),
which represent a family of structurally homologous proteins involved in the degradation of the extracellular
matrix. Several members of the MMP family have been identified as drug targets in the context of chronic
inflammatory disease and cancer metastasis. MMPs feature a highly conserved catalytic center, which results
in a low selectivity of orthosteric small molecule inhibitors for individual MMPs and limits their therapeutic use.
This project aims to identify allosteric mechanisms in MMPs that enable the targeted development of highly
selective allosteric MMP inhibitors as potential drug candidates.
The methods developed for this project are general and not specific to MMPs. They will thus be applicable for
the identification of allosteric mechanisms in other drug target proteins and will be made available as open-
source software."

Kimberly Paul, PhD, MPH, is a neurologic and aging disease epidemiologist whose research career goals focus
around using modern, “omic” technologies to define the neurodegenerative disease process and elucidate risk
at a biologic level, integrating a systems biology approach, in population-based studies. The research she
proposes, entitled “Immune System Aging in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia:
Epigenetics, biologic aging, and heightened immune states”, combines advanced statistical methods and
a systems biology modeling approach with high-throughput omics markers to study immune system aging in
neurodegenerative disease patients relative to community-based controls; followed by relating epigenetic
markers of inflamm-aging to symptom development and multiple metabolomics measurements over time.
Candidate & Mentoring Team: Dr. Paul is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Epidemiology at the
Fielding School of Public Health (UCLA) and will transition to an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine. Dr. Paul was previously awarded an NIEHS F32 to investigate how
metabolic dysfunction mediates the association between ambient environmental exposures and primarily
Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD). For this work, she was awarded the prestigious Chancellor’s
Award for Postdoctoral Research at UCLA. Her research priorities have developed into bringing biology and
mechanism into population and data science. The proposed career development plan will build upon her previous
training with goals to enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator, including experiential
and didactic learning in design, methods and data interpretation, while developing the leadership and
professional skills required to lead an independent research lab and execute an R01. Dr. Paul has assembled a
strong mentoring team with renowned expertise, commitment, and available resources to support her training.
Research Summary: The research aims of this K01 proposal focus on using a systems biology pipeline to
investigate immune system aging in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and ADRD patients, using blood-based
epigenetics to define immune states. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate how these immune markers
and measures of accelerated immune system aging relate to onset, symptom development, and trajectories of
metabolomic changes using two population-based studies. The hypothesis being that immune profiles which
reflect “inflamm-aging” (chronic, low-level inflammation states) and immunosenescence will be related to faster
symptom development. Furthermore, longitudinal metabolomics and targeted gene sequencing will give insight
into endogenous risk and the systemic response related to different immune states as symptoms develop.
This award will provide Dr. Paul the research opportunity and career development resources to continue to excel
and establish herself as an independent investigator and leader in her field, conducting innovative research,
combining systems biology, omic technologies, and population-based research."

Obesity is a major risk factor for several metabolic diseases most notably diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
During diet-induced obesity, visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) responds to caloric excess through the
recruitment of new fat cells (hyperplasia) and enlargement of existing white adipocytes (hypertrophy). To
facilitate this adipocyte expansion, the stromal vascular compartment consisting of mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSC) and immune cells undergo dramatic changes in cell number and gene expression leading to WAT fibrosis
and inflammation, thereby exacerbating metabolic dysfunction. To investigate the mechanisms controlling
hyperplasia, we applied single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to define the cellular landscape of the stroma
and examine how it changes during diet-induced obesity. We observed an extensive increase in macrophages
including CD9+ senescent macrophages which secreted profibrogenic factors most notably osteopontin. We also
identified four distinct populations of MSCs and an early adipocyte progenitor cluster expressing both PDGFRα
and PDGFRβ. In an obese state, these cells enhanced their ECM production thereby contributing to fibrosis. In
the case of hypertrophy, adipocytes progressively increase their volume as they take up and store excess
calories. This expansion along with reduced angiogenesis causes local hypoxia that induces the deposition of
pericellular ECM. The combination of ECM production from MSCs and adipocytes leads to formation of a stiff
and inflexible barrier against further adipocyte expansion and adipocyte dysfunction. To identify mechanisms
responsible for the dysfunction, we performed a RNAseq analysis of isolated adipocytes to assess global
pathway changes occurring during a prolonged HFD. The studies revealed that adipocytes respond dramatically
to the diet by enhancing expression of genes encoding ECM, focal adhesion, and cytoskeletal proteins. In fact,
the transcriptional signature of the resultant pathological adipocytes was similar to fibroblastic-like or progenitor
cells. The transcriptional mechanisms regulating both hyperplasia and hypertrophy are still poorly defined. Our
earlier studies discovered that the transcriptional cofactor myocardin-related transcription factor, MRTFA
contributes to diet-induced metabolic disruption of adipose tissue by regulating the fate of MSCs to favor
fibrogenesis over adipogenesis. We hypothesize that MRTFA integrates multiple fibrogenic signals leading to
ECM production by MSCs producing mechanical stress on adipocytes leading to their fibroblastic-like phenotype
and adipose tissue dysfunction. We propose three aims:1: Determine the effect of conditional deletion of MRTFA
in adipogenic progenitors on the cellular composition and function of adipose tissue in obese mice. 2: Define the
signaling pathways regulating adipocyte progenitor cell fate in response to diet. 3: Identify transcriptional
mechanisms regulating the fate of vascular progenitors. At the completion of these aims, we will have defined
new mechanisms regulating WAT remodeling during obesity and identified targets for development of anti-
obesity therapeutics."

Among patients with cancer, the risk of anticoagulant-related major bleeding is more than double that of
patients without cancer. These bleeds have a fatality rate of 7%. Current guidelines recommend indefinite
anticoagulant therapy in many patients with cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE) with periodic
assessments of bleeding risk. However, no evidence-based models exist to quantify bleeding risk in patients
with cancer taking anticoagulants. In addition, recent trials have demonstrated effectiveness of direct oral
anticoagulants as primary prophylaxis for prevention of initial VTE in patients with cancer. Thus, there is a
strong need to balance the competing risks of VTE and anticoagulant-related bleeding in patients with
cancer. While there are models that quantify bleeding risk in non-cancer populations (i.e. atrial fibrillation, non-
cancer associated VTE) taking anticoagulants, they have not been validated in patients with cancer.
Quantification of bleeding risk in patients with cancer and VTE would allow for an evidence-based approach to
preventing and treating VTE by minimizing anticoagulant therapy in patients at high-risk of bleeding and
allowing for judicial use in patients at low-risk of bleeding. The overall objective of this study is to develop a
prediction model for anticoagulant-related bleeding in patients with cancer and VTE on anticoagulant therapy
and to calibrate that model in cancer patients at high-risk of VTE being considered for primary
thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulant therapy. We will accomplish our overall objective through the following
specific aims: (1) validate eight existing bleeding prediction models in a cohort of 7489 patients with cancer
and VTE receiving anticoagulant therapy, (2) refine and validate a cancer-specific prediction model to quantify
risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding in patients with cancer on anticoagulant therapy for VTE, and (3)
calibrate the refined bleeding prediction model in a cohort of patients with cancer receiving primary
anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis enrolled in two randomized trials (AVERT and CASSINI). These aims will be
addressed with an expert research team in the areas of bleeding, VTE (especially in patients with cancer) and
development and implementation of risk prediction models. This proposal is innovative as it addresses a
current gap in the management of patients with cancer with or at high-risk of VTE by developing a prediction
model to quantify the risk of the intervention (anticoagulant therapy) to inform and guide patient care. This
research will be significant because it has the potential to decrease anticoagulant-related bleeding and thus
bleeding related morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer."
10746838,"Variants in the KCNT1 gene, which encodes a Na+-activated K+ channel, cause several severe
childhood epilepsy disorders that are largely refractory to treatment. Previously, pathogenic
KCNT1 variants were shown to increase channel current when assayed in non-neuronal cells,
leading to the fundamental question of how increasing a current that is usually associated with
dampening neuronal excitability leads to disorders characterized by excessive, synchronous
neuronal activity. We have created two mouse models with orthologous pathogenic human
KCNT1 variants that have frequent seizures. In both models, cortical inhibitory neurons (cINs)
show strong impairments in membrane excitability and action potential generation, whereas
excitatory neurons (cENs) do not. These data suggest that KCNT1 gain-of-function (GOF)
variants cause childhood epilepsy by impairing the function of cINs, and that KCNT1 channels
play cell-type-specific roles in regulating neuronal excitability. This proposal will test these
hypotheses by (1) determining how KCNT1 block and GOF affect membrane excitability of cIN
subtypes, (2) using newly-developed KCNT1-selective inhibitors to measure the current and
how it is altered by disease-causing variants in cIN subtypes, and (3) testing how impaired
membrane excitability in subpopulations of cINs affects their activity in vivo, and how this relates
to seizures or cortical hyperexcitability. Determining these vulnerable cell types, the underlying
mechanisms, and the in vivo effects of their dysfunction will allow us to relate cellular deficits to
epileptiform activity and seizures. The results will advance our understanding of the regulation
of cIN excitability, the physiological roles of the KCNT1-mediated current, and the disease
mechanisms of KCNT1 GOF in an in vivo model of epilepsy. This will narrow the knowledge gap
between the biophysical effects of ion channel variants and the resulting dysfunction of
networks, and has the potential to improve the targeting of precision therapies for severe
childhood epilepsies."
10796829,"A formal group theory-based model in primates for studying interactive social
behavior and its dysfunction
Unlike most forms of solitary behavior that have been broadly studied through animal models, remarkably little
is known about the single-neuronal or causal bases of interactive social behavior and its dysfunction. One of the
major reasons for this limitation is the general lack of animal models and framework for studying the neural
substrates of social behavior whereby two or more individuals interact in real-time and in a way that is
amenable to neuronal analysis or perturbation techniques. This limited understanding impacts not only wide
spanning fields of study such as ecology, neurology and psychology but also our ability to treat conditions such
as autism-spectrum disorder in which social behavior is prominently affected. Primates are highly social
animals that share many behaviors in common with humans and can serve as a potential model for
understanding the basic elements that underlie interactive behavior. In this proposal, we aim to build on our
team’s unique combined experience with jointly interacting primate pairs and groups, social theory, multi-site
neuronal recordings and time-resolved neuromodulation techniques to begin identifying some of the basic
neuronal encoding components of interactive behaviors, their representation within and across cortical
populations, and their dynamic across short and long temporal scales. Using social group theory in primates
together with population modeling and perturbation techniques, we will investigate core social constructs such
as agency identity, group dynamics and decision strategies essential for effective social behavior. We will also
test specific hypotheses on the causal contribution that distinct frontal, temporal and parietal areas play in social
interaction and what exact aspects are involved. Taken together, this proposal aims to provide a formal theory-
based model by which to begin investigating interactive social behavior at the single-neuronal, population and
circuit-based levels. We believe that this is an essential new line of investigation and has the potential to open
up a poorly explored but important field within neuroscience and from which to begin testing neuro-modulatory
interventions aimed at treating psychosocial disorders."
10823366,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The human gut microbiota provides essential functions in human health. However, the microbiota is
constantly subjected to challenges such as intestinal inflammation, which drives the microbiota into a perturbed
state that can cause or exacerbate diseases. Therefore, microbial resilience, which maintains the structural and
functional stability of the gut microbiome in the face of perturbations, is crucial to host health. Despite a central
role in host health, the mechanisms underlying microbiota resilience remain poorly defined. During intestinal
inflammation, host processes known as nutritional immunity starve gut microbes from essential micronutrients
such as iron, constituting stress that both commensal and pathogenic bacteria must cope with to survive. Enteric
pathogens overcome nutritional immunity using a series of exquisite mechanisms, including encoding receptors
for host iron-binding proteins and producing iron-chelating molecules termed siderophores. In contrast to these
well-studied strategies, how gut commensals survive iron starvation in the inflamed gut remains largely unknown.
We propose that maintaining iron homeostasis is an essential strategy for commensals to remain resilient during
gut inflammation. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that the model gut commensal Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) acquires iron by pirating siderophores from an enteric pathogen that induces intestinal
iron limitation. Our new preliminary data suggest that B. theta captures siderophores using an extracellular
lipoprotein. We further show that enteric pathogens such as Salmonella can exploit this capture mechanism to
“re-pirate” siderophores from gut commensals to evade nutritional immunity. In addition to increasing iron uptake,
our unpublished data demonstrate that B. theta employs small, non-coding RNAs to orchestrate iron
conservation to maintain intracellular iron homeostasis and combat nutritional immunity in the inflamed intestine.
As such, our central hypothesis is that B. theta couples siderophore acquisition with small RNA-mediated
intracellular iron conservation to maintain resilience in the inflamed gut. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing
the following specific aims: 1) Elucidate how siderophore acquisition mediates B. theta resilience and modifies
host nutritional immunity in the inflamed gut; and 2) Determine how B. theta maintains intracellular iron
homeostasis in the inflamed gut. The completion of this work will reveal the mechanisms by which gut
commensals adapt to iron limitation and how such adaptation shapes the structural and functional stability of the
microbiota during gut inflammation. This research is innovative because it adds commensal iron metabolism
as a previously unrecognized dimension to the intricate interactions between pathogen and nutritional immunity.
This proposed work is impactful because establishing a model for iron regulation in B. theta will provide
insights into how interphylum iron metabolism may broadly contribute to gut microbiota resilience in the inflamed
gut."
10792904,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Today’s youth suffer from unprecedented levels of physical inactivity and poor physical fitness, which
contribute to myriad health complications, including increased risk for cardiovascular disease. School physical
education (PE) is one of the most valuable tools for increasing physical activity and improving youth fitness and
shows potential for reducing related health disparities. However, despite laws in 43 states mandating that
schools offer PE, compliance is extremely low in elementary schools, and disparities based on school-level
student race/ethnicity and income exist. Evidence points to a lack of accountability as a major factor in low PE
law compliance, but measures of accountability are inconsistent (or non-existent) across states, and best
practices for increasing compliance with PE mandates remain unknown. This study proposes to examine two
novel approaches for increasing PE law compliance by first, determining the impact of the New York City
Department of Education’s multi-level school physical education (PE) intervention on PE law compliance and
student cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as its cost-effectiveness for increasing student physical activity in
order to inform replicability in other school districts. Secondly, one component of New York’s intervention – a
PE audit and feedback tool – will be piloted in Oakland, CA schools to determine the effectiveness,
adaptability, and scalability of this potential cost-effective approach for increasing PE law compliance and
student physical activity. I am pursuing the NHLBI K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to fill
critical training gaps in (1) causal inference from observational data; (2) cost-effectiveness analysis; and (3)
implementation science. This award will build upon my significant experience in school-based physical activity
research, epidemiologic methods, and participatory action research. My long-term career goal is to develop
and rigorously evaluate policy and programmatic approaches to improve youth health through physical activity.
The skills I seek to obtain will be critical in achieving this goal. My detailed training plan includes formal
coursework at UC Berkeley and UCSF, NIH courses, mentored experience, meetings, seminars, and directed
readings. The research component of this project will provide opportunities to integrate new knowledge into
practical research experience. Together, the training and protected time provided by the K01 award, combined
with the rich collaborative environment and strong institutional support at the UC Berkeley School of Public
Health and the Nutrition Policy Institute, will facilitate my transition into an independent investigator who can
successfully compete for R01 funding. It will also provide the means to help me become a leader in the
development and testing of scalable school physical activity environment and policy interventions that will
reduce population risk of inactivity-related chronic diseases."
10758967,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has been epidemiologically demonstrated to be a pre-requisite for
developing multiple sclerosis (MS), as essentially 100% of MS patients become infected with EBV prior to MS
onset. We recently identified molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBNA1 and the glial cellular
adhesion molecule GlialCAM in 20 - 25% of MS patients, and this is likely a critical mechanism underlying the
development of MS in this subset of patients. This R01 will take our investigation of the role of EBV in mediating
the pathogenesis of MS to the next level, through: (i) analysis of dysregulated transcriptional pathways in EBV-
transformed B cells derived from MS patients, (ii) investigation of the ability of EBV-transformed B cells to
mediate autoreactive T cell activation, and (iii) characterization of molecular mimicry-related EBV and CNS
autoantibodies in MS. We will test the hypothesis that in MS, EBV activates B cells to circumvent B cell tolerance,
and thereby drive autoantibody production, autoreactive T cell activation, and MS pathology. We further
hypothesize that different reactivities to self-antigens, to EBV, and to molecular mimics are pathognomonic for
distinct MS disease subtypes with different HLA/genetic backgrounds and disease characteristics. Aim 1 will
analyze dysregulated transcriptional pathways in EBV+ B cells derived from MS vs. controls. Aim 2 will express
MS EBV+ B cell-encoded monoclonal antibodies and identify their EBV and CNS targets. Aim 3 will investigate
the ability of EBV-transformed B cells to mediate autoreactive T cell activation. Aim 4 will perform serologic
analysis to characterize molecular mimicry-related EBV and CNS autoantibodies in sera from large cohorts of
MS and comparator patients. Success of the proposed studies would elucidate the mechanisms by which EBV
causes MS, which would transform our understanding of MS and could lead to fundamental therapies."
10770439,"ABSTRACT
ETS family protein alterations (primarily ERG translocations) are present in >50% of human prostate cancers
in Western men. We were the first to develop a robust GEM model of ERG-driven prostate cancer, revealing
enhanced luminal differentiation and an expanded androgen receptor (AR) cistrome in tumors, suggesting a
novel mechanism for ERG oncogenicity via chromatin programming (Chen, 2013). We and others
subsequently established that ERG activates a luminal differentiation program in prostate organoids, human
prostate cell lines and, by computational analysis of prostate cancer genomes, in clinical samples (Blee et al.,
2018; Kron et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020b). Other ETS gain-of-function alterations e.g. ETV4 translocations (Li et
al., 2020a) and ETS loss-of-function alterations e.g. ERF repressor mutations/deletions (Bose et al., 2017) also
show this phenotype, as does FOXA1 (also amplified or mutated in prostate cancer) but with a contracted AR
cistrome (Adams et al., 2019). Having demonstrated that luminal differentiation is a primary feature of multiple
oncogenic ETS proteins (and FOXA1), our major goal during the next funding cycle is to understand how ERG
activates this differentiation program and how this program results in an oncogenic phenotype. We will pursue
three parallel lines of investigation. First, from our biochemical studies using purified full-length proteins and
various DNA templates, we find that that ERG (and other ETS factors) cooperatively enhance AR DNA binding
through allosteric effects via direct protein-protein interaction; biologically, this broadens the AR cistrome to
include novel AR binding sites (Wasmuth et al., 2020). Aim 1 will expand this analysis to assess the role of
FOXA1 on AR/ERG interactions. Second, we have built genetically defined prostate organoid models that
recapitulate the luminal differentiation effect of ERG within a precisely defined time course. Using this system,
we identified epigenetic changes that silence transcription of the basal epithelial master regulator p63, likely
explaining the reduction in basal cells. Aim 2 will use lineage tracing, single cell analysis, and CRISPR
screening to further elucidate how ERG expands the number of luminal cells and initiates oncogenic
transformation. Third, we showed that another oncogenic ETS protein (ETV4) also drives luminal differentiation
and is sufficient, alone, to initiate prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Remarkably, these luminal epithelial
cells acquire exquisite dependence on AR for survival (in contrast to normal luminal epithelial cells) and
consequently display enhanced sensitivity to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Aim 3 will explore
mechanisms underlying this shift to cell-intrinsic AR dependence by examining changes in the AR cistrome
and transcriptome following luminal-specific AR ablation (by genetic deletion) versus systemic androgen
deprivation through surgical castration (impairs AR function in prostate stroma and epithelium). We will
complement these experiments with single cell analysis of ETS-positive patient samples before and after ADT."
10773100,"SUMMARY
Alternative RNA splicing is a key step in gene expression regulation and contributes to transcriptional diversity
by selecting which transcript isoforms are produced in a specific cell at a specific time point. Aberrantly spliced
isoforms can impact every one of the hallmarks of cancer, including increased cell proliferation, migration, or
resistance to apoptosis. Regulatory splicing factors (SFs) have recently emerged as a new class of oncoproteins
and tumor suppressors. In particular, the tumorigenic capacity of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC, which
is dysregulated in >50% of human tumors, has been shown to be dependent on the splicing machinery and on
at least 3 SFs directly regulated by MYC. However, we currently do not have a comprehensive understanding of
which component(s) of the splicing machinery are regulated by MYC, or of the functions of MYC-induced spliced
isoforms. The goal of this proposal is to systematically characterize the mechanisms by which MYC-regulated
SFs and spliced isoforms drive tumor growth and maintenance. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, in
our preliminary studies we used a mammary cell line harboring an inducible form of MYC to greatly expand the
number of known SFs regulated by MYC. We uncovered that MYC activation promotes alternative splicing of
>4,000 isoforms and expression of 125 SFs. These SFs are also upregulated in MYC-active breast tumors and
can be grouped, based on co-expression, into groups or modules. Six SF-modules highly correlate with MYC
activity in breast tumors and cell lines, and are enriched in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Which of these
SFs play a role in MYC-driven transformation, and whether co-expression of multiple MYC-induced SFs has a
stronger tumorigenic effect than individual SFs, is not known. Further, co-expression analysis in 33 TCGA tumors
of different tissue origin identified an SF-module shared across all MYC-active tumors, suggesting a pan-cancer
vulnerability. We hypothesize that MYC regulates a network of SFs which cooperate in tumor pathogenesis and
that disrupting this network could provide a novel strategy to slow growth of MYC-driven tumors. Here, we will
leverage our expertise in RNA splicing and cancer biology and apply a functional genomics approach to gain
novel insights into MYC's oncogenicity. Aim 1 will characterize the function of 6 MYC-induced SF modules and
their splicing targets in TNBC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Since it is unknown whether MYC regulates a
shared set of isoforms in distinct tissues, Aim 2 will identify pan-cancer splicing signatures predictive of MYC
activity and clinical outcomes, which may serve as clinical biomarkers, and will deliver putative neo-antigens
generated from MYC-induced isoforms. Finally, Aim 3 will implement genomic approaches to determine which
MYC-induced isoforms are essential for the growth of MYC-driven cancer cells and patient-derived organoids.
This project will reveal fundamental mechanisms by which oncogenic SFs and their target spliced isoforms drive
tumorigenesis downstream of MYC. These results could help inform development of therapeutic strategies for
tumors driven by MYC, which remains an undruggable target."
10758858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This proposal details a five-year research career development program focused on the identification of
individuals in a hospital-based biobank with genomic variants associated with undiagnosed treatable genetic
disorders. The proposed research, which builds upon my prior research and clinical experience, requires
mastery of new skills related to the identification of individuals at risk for monogenic disorders in unselected
populations. I have assembled an internationally-renowned team of mentors, whose areas of expertise span
several domains of genomics research and medicine. My mentors include Dr. Robert Green, an expert in the
medical, behavioral, and economic outcomes associated with the implementation of genomic medicine; Dr.
Heidi Rehm, an expert in variant curation and gene-disease relationships; and Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, an
expert in computational and integrative genomics. Through the proposed research and training, I will develop
interdisciplinary skills that will enable me to transition to independence as a physician-scientist.
Although monogenic genetic disorders are individually rare, they are estimated to collectively affect 1.5–6.2%
of the global population. Most individuals with genetic conditions present to medical care after the development
of symptoms and receive diagnoses following lengthy and expensive diagnostic odysseys. As the number of
treatable genetic conditions grows, the need to identify at-risk individuals early has become more urgent.
Population-based genomic sequencing, also known as a “genome-first approach,” provides an opportunity to
improve public health outcomes by screening individuals for genetic disorders prior to the onset of symptoms.
At this time, however, little is known about the penetrance and health outcomes of individuals with genetic risk
variants from unselected populations. In this project, I propose to: 1) identify the prevalence of individuals with
risk variants for a range of treatable monogenic conditions in both the hospital-based Mass General Brigham
Biobank (MGBB) and U.K. Biobank (UKB), 2) recontact individuals in the MGBB who have genotypes
associated with treatable inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) to identify variables associated with disease
expression, and 3) determine if metabolic profiling in the UKB can be used to predict outcomes in individuals
with risk variants for a subset of IMDs. This work represents a step toward determining the best uses of
genome-first medicine, eventually accelerating access to genomic risk-stratification, appropriate follow-up,
orthogonal testing, and care for people with rare genetic disorders."

research education program that provides underrepresented minority undergraduate students
(“diversity trainees”) with an inspirational, perspective and career transforming biomedical
research experience in the Colorado Undergraduate Summer Program (“CUSP”).
 Overview: CUSP uses NHLBI funding to recruit and enroll 8 diversity trainees each summer from
colleges nationwide. Trainees prepare for and conduct laboratory research for 9 weeks with an
experienced investigator/mentor. Trainees design their own project, perform hands-on research, attend
daily interactive research discussions, and present their research at our concluding school-wide
graduation poster session. Trainees also participate in complementary clinical conferences, receive career
advice from admissions directors, faculty, and students, shadow physicians in clinical settings, and are
integrated into a wide range of supportive social and academic diverse campus communities.
 Innovative Aspects: CUSP (1) is a well established program that consistently attracts many top
applicants from colleges nationwide, (2) uses a holistic selection process that targets students who are not
committed to biomedical research careers, (3) amplifies learning by adding additional diversity and non-
diversity trainees using additional non-federal matching support from participating colleges, donors, and
CU, (4) is located on a new all inclusive contiguous medical campus that offers many research and
learning opportunities, (5) employs a unifying inflammatory, immunologic, and oxidative stress related
mechanisms focus that is relevant to NHLBI related health and disease, (6) emphasizes using
experienced enthusiastic diversity and non-diversity mentors, (7) embodies a comprehensive instructional
and laboratory program that engages trainees by integrating research training, medical perspectives,
career counseling, campus tours, and social activities, (8) provides additional shadowing, educational, and
social activities, and (9) is independently reviewed by education evaluation experts working at CU.
 Program Success: Independent evaluations indicate that CUSP diversity trainees (1) appreciate and
embrace all aspects of CUSP, (2) become more knowledgeable and enthusiastic about research and
research careers, (3) continue CUSP mentor relationships, (4) conduct research again, (5) frequently enter
health professions schools, and (6) actively promote CUSP to new trainee candidates.
 Program Director: John E. Repine, MD will continue his leadership as an experienced physician-
scientist-teacher-mentor who founded and directed CUSP for the last 9 years.
 Significance: CUSP motivates and prepares biomedical research uninformed diversity trainees for
continuing in biomedical research and undertaking biomedical research and health care related careers."

 Childhood cancer survivors treated with abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy (RT) are almost four times more
likely to develop colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to the general population with their elevated risk evident by
the age of 30 years with no plateau. Since earlier detection of precancerous lesions (i.e. adenomas) or CRC is
strongly associated with improved survival, screening with colonoscopy or multitarget stool DNA testing (mt-
sDNA) with a colonoscopy after a positive test is recommended starting at age 30. Unfortunately, the vast
majority of survivors at high-risk for CRC are not adherent to recommended screening. Magnifying this problem,
most childhood cancer survivors are no longer followed at a cancer center, are unaware of their risks and are
being followed by primary care providers (PCPs) who are not informed about the recommended follow-up care.
 In order to improve adherence to CRC screening guidelines in high-risk childhood cancer survivors, we
propose the ASPIRES (Activating cancer Survivors and their Primary care providers to Increase coloREctal
cancer Screening) Study, which is the first known intervention to attempt to increase CRC screening rates in this
population using a remote digital mHealth intervention. This is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate
the utility of patient activation with and without added PCP activation to increase CRC screening. We propose to
randomize 315 survivors, who are at least 30 years of age, with a history of abdominal or pelvic radiation for a
childhood cancer and without a history of CRC.
 The primary outcome is obtaining CRC screening with colonoscopy or mt-sDNA during the 12-month
study period. We will determine the comparative effectiveness of (1) a mHealth patient activation intervention
and (2) patient activation plus PCP activation, compared to control. Secondary aims include (1) conducting a
multi-stakeholder mixed-methods Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)-informed
evaluation to understand patient, provider and system factors associated with uptake of the intervention, to
explore enablers and barriers to uptake of CRC screening, and to generate recommendations for future
adaptation, scalability and sustainability; (2) identify potential moderators and mediators of uptake of CRC
screening; and (2) estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
 The proposed ASPIRES Study brings together a research team with necessary expertise and experience
in survivorship, CRC screening, dissemination and implementation, and mHealth intervention research with the
unique resource of the 31-institution Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Notably, the CCSS represents
the single largest cohort of survivors in the target population and the infrastructure to conduct the proposed
study. Results from this intervention will have important implications for patients at high-risk for CRC and we
expect that findings from this study will provide the evidence for implementation and dissemination of our CRC
screening interventions targeting these populations."
10910997,"Approximately half of all treatment seeking Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have
problems with alcohol, yet it is unclear how current alcohol use affects critical processes mediating recovery from
trauma. Despite strong preclinical evidence that recent, heavy alcohol exposure adversely impacts fear
extinction, and that fear extinction is central to recovery from PTSD, the direct effects of current, problematic
alcohol use on fear extinction have not been characterized in those with PTSD and alcohol use disorders
(PAUD). Similarly, contextual fear processing, or the accurate discrimination of threat in the environment, is
implicated in the maintenance of PTSD but has never been explored in PAUD. Severe symptom profiles, small
treatment gains, and high treatment dropout rates in Veterans with PAUD underscore the need to understand
the effects of current heavy drinking on the mechanisms of fear extinction and contextual fear processing.
Without studies accounting for the influence of alcohol on processes central to PTSD recovery, treatment
innovation for PAUD is likely to remain limited.
 Previous work and preliminary data from our lab suggest that individuals with PTSD have specific deficits in
fear extinction and recall, and that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus (HPC), amygdala,
insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) play critical roles in the inhibition and expression of fear
processing. Moreover, our preliminary data show that current problematic alcohol use in the context of PTSD is
associated with higher treatment drop-out and fewer treatment gains from exposure-based relative to coping
skills therapy, potentially suggesting an extinction-specific impact of alcohol use on clinical outcomes. While
preclinical models provide compelling mechanistic evidence that chronic alcohol exposure disrupts fear
extinction and recall, as yet there is no clinical analogue to this work. Relatedly, contextual fear processing
is abnormal in PTSD, and damage to the hippocampus (HPC) impairs this process. Tasks used previously to
assess contextual fear processing may not reliably invoke HPC dependent processes, and none have assessed
the impact of alcohol despite the known deleterious impact of alcohol on HPC structure and function.
 In the proposed design, we will compare Veterans with PTSD and ongoing, heavy alcohol use (“Drinking” or
D-PAUD) to those with 30- to 90-days of sustained abstinence (A-PAUD) using a validated 2-day protocol of
concurrent psychophysiological and functional brain imaging measures of fear acquisition, extinction learning,
extinction recall, as well as a newly validated configural threat learning measure of contextual fear processing
that invokes HPC dependent processes. We predict that Veterans with D-PAUD will show physiological response
indicative of greater fear recovery, and neural response consistent with decreased fear inhibition (i.e., less
vmPFC activation) during fear extinction learning and recall, and decreased contextual fear processing (i.e., less
HPC activation) relative to those with A-PAUD. We will also use directed-functional connectivity to identify neural
networks involved in fear extinction recall and to demonstrate differential group-related circuit adaptations, and
will employ computational predictive modeling to identify regions specifically tracking dynamic US expectations
and compare these patterns between the two clinical groups.
 The proposed research will provide the first data on how current heavy drinking in the context of PAUD
affects fear extinction and contextual fear processing, which are central mechanisms of PTSD recovery, using
gold-standard and innovative approaches. Discovery of specific patterns of neural response can lay the
groundwork for the investigation of neuromodulatory and pharmacological interventions, as well as clinical trials
investigating the efficacy of existing or novel treatments that act at key mechanisms of recovery. In sum, the
proposed study will identify critical alcohol-specific mechanisms of impairment to provide a roadmap for the
development of targeted interventions to increase the efficacy, efficiency, and innovation of PAUD treatments."

Despite currently available treatments, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the
United States. As dysregulated lipoprotein metabolism contribute to cardiovascular disease, there is a
critical need to decipher the lipoprotein pathways, including those regulated by ANGPTL proteins, that
drive cardiovascular pathologies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand how
ANGPTL proteins regulate lipid homeostasis and how these proteins become dysregulated in disease.
One ANGPTL protein, the hepatokine ANGPTL3, inhibits both endothelial lipase (EL) and lipoprotein
lipase, and thus regulates both plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. The objective in this application is to
identify the mechanisms by which ANGPTL3 regulates EL and how this regulation affects HDL
metabolism and cardiovascular disease. The central hypothesis of this study is that ANGPTL3 inhibits EL
by promoting structural changes that disrupt its stability, and that this inhibition prevents the pathologic
remodeling of HDL that contributes to atherosclerosis. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) Determine the effects of ANGPTL3-mediated EL inhibition on atherosclerosis and HDL
function; and 2) Identify the mechanism by which ANGPTL3 inhibits EL. The studies in aim 1 use mice
that express mutant ANGPTL3 alleles that only inhibit EL or LPL. These mice will be crossed with ApoE
knockout mice to determine the respective contributions of ANGPTL3-mediated EL inhibition and LPL
inhibition to atherosclerosis. These mice will also be used to determine the physiologic locations of EL
inhibition using tissue phospholipase activity assays. Radioactive tracer experiments will be used to
determine how inhibition of EL by ANGPTL3 alters HDL-lipid partitioning, and a variety of HDL functional
assays will be used to determine how this inhibition alters the anti-atherogenic functions of HDL. In aim
2, various biochemical analyses, including phospholipase activity assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and
hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, will be used to probe the functional interactions of
ANGPTL3 with EL. The proposed studies are innovative in their use of ANGPTL3 alleles that only inhibit
LPL or only inhibit EL to decouple the physiological effects of LPL and EL inhibition. The proposed
studies are significant because lipoprotein homeostasis is essential for cardiovascular health. Therefore,
uncovering how and where ANGPTL3 inhibits EL activity, and how this inhibition impacts HDL function,
HDL metabolism, and the progression of atherosclerosis will increase our fundamental understanding of
how lipoprotein metabolism is regulated. Completion of the aims outlined in this study will have a broad
positive impact as lipoprotein metabolism contributes to many metabolic diseases, and thus
understanding how the regulators of these pathways, including ANGPTL3, can best be therapeutically
targeted may have wide-reaching implications for improved outcomes for these diseases."
10812993,"Bacteria play critical beneficial and harmful roles in human health. Living in biofilm communities, one
species may attack, protect, or provide nutrients for neighboring species. These interactions determine the
community's net effects. Clarifying community organization is needed to understand how biofilm affects health.
 To begin to meet this need, we developed an imaging technique, Combinatory Labeling and Spectral
Imaging Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (CLASI-FISH), which displays how taxa's cells are located relative
to each other and to host cells. Yet biofilm's complex, three-dimensional (3D) architecture is poorly captured by
commonly used measures, such as intercellular distances or global biofilm volume for one or two taxa.
 Here, we propose to extend Log Gaussian Cox process models (LGCP) to describe and test hypotheses
about human biofilm architecture, a novel application. Computational burden limits existing LGCP models for
geostatistical data to datasets with thousands of observations. These methods cannot be applied to biofilm
image data typically containing millions of observations. In preliminary work on two-dimensional (2D) biofilm
images, we have successfully scaled up multivariate LGCPs for six taxa. Estimated pairwise cross-correlation
functions differ in univariate analyses, which ignore other taxa's locations, versus multivariate analyses, which
leverage taxa's joint spatial distribution. We propose statistical innovations to address challenges raised by, but
not unique to, 3D biofilm images. Comparing biofilm across sample groups defined experimentally or based on
exposure history requires integrating data across subjects' images that lack true spatial correspondence.
Further, 3D spatial analyses have not been applied to multivariate data with millions of observations.
 The goal of this proposal is therefore to build a Bayesian multivariate 3D LGCP that incorporates different
images—thereby allowing for non-spatial covariate factors—by applying a separate coordinate system to each
image. This proposal has three parts: (a) the development of novel multivariate 3D spatial analysis methods
(aims 1-3), (b) evaluation of a hypothesis regarding the spatial structure of human tongue microbiome (aim 4),
and (c) software development and dissemination, based on best practices (aim 5). The interdisciplinary team
has a deep skill set and experience developing Bayesian high-dimensional multivariate analysis methods.
 The core innovation proposed is to integrate non-spatial covariates with multivariate spatial data across 3D
images lacking a common coordinate system. Sample accessibility and prior biological knowledge make the
oral cavity the best starting point to develop a flexible modeling framework that will allow testing of hypotheses
regarding microbial interactions and associations with host characteristics. This is a fundamental shift for how
such images will be analyzed, potentially providing new insight into the role of oral microbes. In advancing
capabilities for studying multivariate 3D spatial patterns across images, the mathematical adaptations and
software we develop will have the potential to yield a breakthrough technology."

Comorbidity in the anxiety disorders is common and strongly associated with poor outcomes, lower rates of
remission, increased disability and higher rates of relapse. Yet despite its clinical relevance, clinicians are unsure
how to treat comorbid anxiety patients, in part because it is unknown whether comorbid cases are marked by
distinct pathophysiology, or whether they should simply be conceptualized as the 'sum of their parts' (i.e.,
multiple, separate clinical entities). Characterizing comorbid individuals as having multiple, independent, disease
processes occludes understanding of synergistic, pathophysiological processes that may uniquely characterize
highly comorbid patients. The current project focuses on a neural profile that corresponds to increased
comorbidity load across the anxiety disorders and is routed in aberrant brain connectivity. This neural profile is
comprised of increased alarm (heightened amygdala) and reduced motivated attention (attenuated late positive
potential, LPP; an EEG measure of elaborated stimulus processing) to negative images, and is referred to as
HARM-A (Heightened Alarm, Reduced Motivated Attention). Controlling for separate effects of alarm and
motivated attention, preliminary data suggest that higher HARM-A is associated with (a) greater internalizing
psychopathology; (b) higher rates of past comorbidity (controlling for current comorbidity) and (c) increased
dysphoria 12-24 months later (controlling for baseline dysphoria). Those with higher HARM-A also showed
aberrant connectivity between key nodes involved in threat detection and appraisal (amygdala-anterior cingulate
cortex), as well as a stronger link between stress and negative affect. Therefore, HARM-A might underlie the
worse outcome in comorbid anxiety cases, and may do so by increasing risk for negative affect generation
following stressful events. The current project extends this preliminary work by examining negative emotion
processing in 180 individuals, recruited to insure dimensionality on current and past internalizing symptoms.
Participants will undergo 3 multi-level assessments (fMRI, EEG, clinical interview, self-report measures) over 24
months; at each assessment, participants will also complete 10 days of experience sampling assessments of
stressful events and negative affect. The project will test a bidirectional model of HARM-A, in which HARM-A
predicts increased future comorbidity load and higher scores on latent, transdiagnostic, internalizing
psychopathology, which will in turn predict increased HARM-A (i.e., a mutually reinforcing “spiral”). It will also
assess the neurocircuitry that supports higher HARM-A and will use experience sampling data to test whether
HARM-A predicts stronger linkage between stress exposure and subsequent negative affect. Finding that
HARM-A is prospectively and reciprocally associated with worse internalizing psychopathology, delineating its
neurocircuitry and elucidating its role in the linkage between stressors and negative affect would deliver a
mechanistic explanation for greater disease burden in comorbid anxiety and provide a path forward for more
etiologically tractable understanding of anxiety-related disorders, and for the development of targeted treatments."
10794974,"Cell fate diversification is part and parcel to mammalian development. With the completion of the Human
Genome Project and subsequent large-scale efforts to functionally characterize the genome, we now know
that coding and non-coding DNA interdependently affect cell fate decisions. High-throughout, largely
descriptive assays carried out by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project and others like it,
have contributed to an increasingly curated list of DNA and RNA regulatory elements associated with cell-type
specific transcriptional and epigenetic programs. However, while it is estimated that 1 million cis-regulatory
elements, presumably mostly enhancers, regulate the protein-coding genome, their identity and
the genes they regulate remain largely unknown.
Here, I propose to apply highly scalable functional approaches to candidate enhancer elements in a
developmentally relevant and tractable system. Specifically, I am further developing a framework, known
as 'massively parallel genome editing' or MPGE, that utilizes a CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach and
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to globally capture perturbations to gene expression. I will apply
this method to mouse embryonic stem cell-derived germ layers, which are essential for body plan assembly
in early development. Together, this study design will validate candidate enhancer elements in their native
context while also identifying the target gene(s) that they regulate. This functional validation of germ layer-specific
enhancer-gene pairs will yield insights into how cell fates emerge in early development."
10778417,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by
germline haploinsufficiency at the NF2 locus, which encodes Merlin. NF2 patients characteristically develop
bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) and spinal schwannomas as a result of loss of heterozygosity of NF2 in
Schwann cells or Schwann cell precursors. Although these tumors are largely benign, their growth can result in
significant neurological deficiencies including, but not limited to, deafness, vertigo, facial muscle weakness,
chronic neuropathic pain, and death. Because of the extensive morbidity associated with surgical removal of
these tumors, there is an urgent need to develop pharmaceutical approaches to halt or reverse the progression
of tumor growth in these patients. To date, no long-term effective therapies exist for these highly debilitating
tumors.
 Given the challenging clinical trial logistics in a rare tumor predisposition syndrome such as NF2, it is
critical to establish a strategy linking preclinical and clinical studies for rapid translational innovation and
efficiency. We have developed genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of NF2 that accurately
recapitulate tumor growth kinetics and histopathologic characteristics observed in NF2 patients—VS and
paraspinal schwannomas with 100% incidence, combined with progressive hearing loss that occurs with VS
formation. Using the Nf2 GEMM, we determined that the FDA approved multi-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
inhibitor brigatinib reduced schwannoma tumor size and tumor number. Brigatinib is approved to treat
cancer driven by another kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and two ALK inhibitors, crizotinib and
brigatinib, have both shown preclinical efficacy against NF2-associated schwannomas and are under
evaluation in active clinical trials. While our findings suggest a role for FAK1 in modulating tumor progression,
our understanding of the role of FAK1 as a single target for NF2 tumors or in combination with other drug
targets is incomplete. We propose to build on our recent preclinical work by genetic ablation of FAK1 (Ptk2)
in murine (Nf2) and human (NF2) deficient Schwann cells to establish the role of FAK1 (Ptk2) in promoting
the genesis of Nf2 deficient schwannomas and associated morbidities (Aim 1). Drug synergy screening with
post-IND FAK inhibitors alone and in combination with RAF, MEK, and BET bromodomain inhibitors to
target cooperating Merlin-regulated pathways (Aim 2), and unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 kinome knockout screening
in murine and human cells to identify FAK1-dependent kinase vulnerabilities that can be exploited
therapeutically, alone or in combination (Aim 3). Our overarching goal with experiments in this application is
to identify drugs or drug combinations that could expediently proceed to phase I/II clinical trials for patients
with this debilitating neurological disease."
10818570,"Identifying and targeting collateral lethal vulnerabilities in cancers
Abstract/Summary
Genomic deletions targeting major tumor suppressor genes frequently include adjacent passenger genes,
encoding cell essential housekeeping functions. These cancer cells survive due to co-expressing functionally
redundant paralogs residing in non-deleted regions of the genome. As such, these “collateral deletions” in tumor
suppressor loci can confer cancer cell-specific vulnerabilities through targeted extinction of the remaining
paralog. Our “collateral lethality” concept was first demonstrated in GBM with deletion of the 1p36 tumor
suppressor locus encompassing ENO1, resulting in profound sensitivity to ENO2 depletion or pharmacologic
inhibition (Muller et al. 2012). Subsequently, we demonstrated that deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2
(ME2) in the SMAD4 locus engendered lethality upon shRNA-mediated depletion of the remaining mitochondrial
malic enzyme activity encoded by the ME3 paralog (Dey et al. 2017). To systematically and comprehensively
identify collateral lethal targets in cancer, we first analyzed the Broad Institute’s Cancer Dependency Map
(DepMap), a publicly accessible database hosting essentiality scores of 17386 genes from a pooled genome-
scale CRISPR knockout study conducted in 1054 cancer cell lines of diverse lineages (Dempster et al. 2019;
Ghandi et al. 2019). The computational efforts yielded multiple collateral lethal candidate pairs including
REEP3/4, PTDSS1/2, INTS6/INTS6L, PRPS1/2, LDHA/B, and CSTF2/CSTF2T via a two-class comparison
method that regressed cell line sensitivity vectors against whole-genome CCLE expression and copy number
data to predict paralog-depletion based sensitivity. While computational analysis of DepMap data can identify
some candidate collateral lethal pairs, small sample sizes for many collateral deletions have stymied robust
conclusions. Building on these computational methods, here we will apply the CRISPR/Cas12a polygenic
knockout platform to systematically identify collateral lethal pairs anchored in deletion events targeting common
tumor suppressor gene loci such as TP53, CDKN2A/B, ARID1A, PTEN, SMAD4, RB1 and NF1 across cancer
types. This conceptual and experimental framework, coupled with a cell/organoid/tumor validation platform,
seeks to identify and stringently validate collateral lethal target sets that can then be channeled into a drug
discovery pipeline with the goal of expanding precision cancer treatments."
10771208,"Abstract: The diagnosis and management for women who are at risk for ectopic pregnancy (EP) and
spontaneous abortion (SAB), has not changed substantially in decades. While ultrasound can diagnose a
significant portion of women at presentation, because of its limited accuracy in abnormal and early gestation, a
large number of women need serial tests and procedures to determine the final location and viability of an early
pregnancy. Misdiagnosis and iatrogenic complications during this time are still too common. This conundrum
results in great stress and uncertainty for women undergoing clinical care and their health care teams. To date,
we have demonstrated (and validated) that multiplexed biomarkers from divergent biological pathways can be
used to minimize both false positive and false negative discrimination (rather than balancing the two errors with
lower accuracy). In parallel, we have discovered and screened more than 54 novel biomarkers to obtain 11
candidates that can predict early pregnancy outcome. Using machine learning we have demonstrated that as
few as 3 of these markers can predict the location of an early gestation (IUP vs EP or SAB) with 95%
accuracy. Additionally, an overlapping group of 3 markers can predict the viability of a gestation (IUP vs SAB
or EP) with 94% accuracy. When both tests are used in combination the accuracy is 96.9%. We now plan to
externally validate these companion diagnostic(s) in a separate population-based prospective study and to
determine the optimal conditions of use. We will optimize performance in women presenting with a pregnancy
of unknown location as well as assess predictive values for all women presenting at risk for early pregnancy
loss using an independent population-based prospective study (SA1). We will determine if accuracy can be
improved with the combination of presenting signs, symptoms, and ultrasound findings (SA2). Moreover, we
will validate our biomarker tests in two distinct populations of interest: women with high and low risk for EP: a)
asymptomatic women prior to presentation for care (EAGeR Trial) and b) women diagnosed with a persistent
pregnancy of unknown location (ACTorNOT Trial) (SA3). Developing novel biomarkers that distinguish normal
physiology from the presence of gynecologic disorders is an NICHD research priority area. Our productive and
established team is proposing rigorous cross disciplinary, state of the art, and novel research with great
scientific impact that has the potential to produce a paradigm shift in clinical care models for the diagnosis and
management of women in early pregnancy. Our detailed plan for biomarker development is iterative and
nimble and, importantly, includes validation. Our development plan is informed by methodology from
successful biomarker development, is designed to minimize known pitfalls, and is developed with FDA
guidance."

The US is poised for growth and investment in our mental health crisis system, with a national phone/text
line launching, accompanied by new funding for crisis services. More than 600 Crisis Stabilization Centers
(CSCs) across the US provide suicidal clients with a more comfortable and less costly alternative to
Emergency Department (ED) care. In light of rising demand, there is an urgent need for feasible,
effective, interpersonal, recovery-oriented interventions. This study adapts and tests a novel
intervention for delivery prior to and after discharge from CSCs. THRIVE uses the Interpersonal Theory of
Suicide as a framework to bolster social connectedness and counter perceived burdensomeness.
Preliminary data shows promising results. However, CSC workflows and culture require context-specific
adaptation. This study leverages the Model for Adaptation Design and Impact to adapt THRIVE for CSCs,
test feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness, and conduct a pilot RCT in two CSCs. The CSC-adapted
intervention addresses interpersonal drivers of suicide risk and bolsters safety, recovery, and community
linkage through: (a) a `belonging and giving' group during CSC stay, (b) recovery coaching calls for 4 weeks
post-discharge, and (c) an optional phone app that provides reinforcement and resources for connection.
The pilot will compare THRIVE + Discharge/Safety Planning (D/SP) to D/SP alone, examining the degree
to which THRIVE engages the targeted mechanisms of change at one- and three-months post-discharge.
Aim 1. Adapt THRIVE and complete CSC-specific manual using MADI.
Aim 2. Test feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness of THRIVE for CSCs.
 CSC Guests (n = 20). 75% of guests will participate in a THRIVE group and at least one follow-up
 session within one month of discharge. Ratings of acceptability and satisfaction will be ≧ 75%.
 CSC Staff (n = 4). Fidelity ratings of audio recordings of group and coaching calls with be at least
 ≧ 75% for all staff who deliver THRIVE.
 CSC Administrators will rate acceptability and appropriateness of THRIVE for CSCs as ≧ 75%.
Aim 3. Conduct a randomized pilot effectiveness trial (n = 162) to assess the effect of THRIVE on
treatment initiation and on key interpersonal drivers of suicide – belongingness and burdensomeness. We
hypothesize that CSC guests who receive THRIVE + D/SP vs. D/SP alone will have:
 H1: Higher rates of treatment initiation at 1 month and 3 months from CSC discharge.
 H2. Increased belongingness and decreased burdensomeness at 1 and 3 months after discharge.
We will explore the effect of the intervention on treatment engagement, acute care psychiatric
readmissions, and suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior over 3-month follow-up. At the end of the study,
THRIVE for CSCs will be ready to test in an effectiveness trial for preventing suicidal behavior."

10809002,"Summary
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide and can often persist in
immunocompromised individuals leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no FDA-
approved vaccines or HEV-specific therapy in the U.S. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular details
of the HEV infectious cycle to aid in the rational design of HEV-specific prevention and treatment. HEV is an
enterically transmitted positive-strand RNA virus with a unique life cycle: the virus is shed as naked particles into
the feces but circulates as quasi-enveloped (eHEV) particles in the bloodstream. The dogma in the field has
been that eHEV mediates virus spread in the infected host, and its biogenesis requires the viral ORF3 protein.
It is proposed that ORF3 usurps the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)
machinery to acquire an envelope from the multivesicular bodies (MVBs). However, in cell culture, HEV can
spread regardless of ORF3 expression, and clinical isolates bearing ORF3 start codon mutations have also been
described. Thus, the release mechanism for HEV is likely to be more complex than previously thought. In HEV-
infected polarized human hepatocyte cultures and human liver chimeric mice, ORF3 almost exclusively localizes
to the apical/canalicular membrane. Moreover, our recently published work shows that ORF3 is required for
apical but not the basolateral release of HEV from polarized human hepatoma cells. This application seeks to
better define the mechanism for HEV release from polarized hepatocytes and to clarify the role of ORF3 in this
process. Our central hypothesis is that ORF3 dictates apical release of HEV but is not required for basolateral
release from polarized hepatocytes. We propose two specific aims to test this hypothesis using in vitro and in
vivo models. Aim 1 will use a highly polarized human hepatoma cell line to elucidate the mechanism for HEV
release from both the apical and basolateral sides of human hepatocytes. We will determine that ORF3 recruits
HEV capsid and ESCRT components to the apical recycling endosomes (AREs)-derived transport vesicles to
facilitate HEV envelopment and exit, and an ORF3-independent mechanism is responsible for HEV release at
the basolateral surface that mediates virus spread. Aim 2 will investigate the HEV release mechanisms in a
newly developed rat model of HEV infection. The role of ORF3, ESCRT, MVBs and AREs will be investigated
using various viral mutants. The morphology and protein composition of HEV virions in the bloodstream will be
characterized and compared to virions released from the apical and basolateral sides of polarized human
hepatoma cells. The completion of this work will shed new light on the unusual HEV life cycle and clarify the role
of ORF3 in HEV infection. The knowledge gained from this research will also have broad implications for
hepatocyte biology and noncytolytic release mechanisms for both nonenveloped and enveloped viruses."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a major cause of HCC. It is clinically recognized that
HCC in NASH often arises at a pre-cirrhotic stage, however the pathomechanism of HCC in
non-cirrhotic livers is not well understood. As T2DM with poor glycemic control is an
independent risk factor for HCC it is plausible that there are distinct pathways that create a pro-
carcinogenic niche in non-cirrhotic T2DM/NASH. We showed that the accumulation of
advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in patients with T2DM/NASH and in an animal model
are key to necroinflammation and oxidative liver injury. Downregulation of the AGE clearance
receptor AGER1 accelerated AGE deposition, and correcting AGER1 in vivo improved NASH.
To study how high AGE environment creates permissive conditions for transformed cells, we
modulated diet/AGE content prior to hydrodynamic injection of hMET/mutant β-catenin: 1) High
AGE background induced an earlier and more invasive HCC, 2) AGE accumulation was linked
to significant changes in matrix dynamics-with an increase in energy dissipation or loss and
faster stress relaxation in response to a deformation - in an AGE and receptor for AGEs
(RAGE)-dependent manner, 3) Inhibiting AGE production reversed changes in matrix
viscoelasticity in vivo and lowered tumor burden. We will test the hypothesis that in non-
cirrhotic T2DM/NASH accumulation of AGEs contribute to an increase in matrix viscoelasticity
and matricellular changes creating a pro-invasive environment. Aim 1: We propose to
investigate the link between diet/AGE content, matrix viscoelasticity, sex and HCC phenotypes
and outcomes in a novel HCC model. In particular we will focus on how AGE-mediated
collagen crosslinks on specific amino acids can alter intermolecular recognition and interaction
with proteoglycans thereby affecting matrix dynamics. Aim 2: We will dissect the effects of
RAGE and AGER1 signals and AGE accumulation on matrix viscoelastic parameters and HCC
phenotypes. In Aim 3 we propose to develop a 3D hydrogel system with tunable viscoelasticity
and the impact of AGEs-modified matrix on cell behavior will be studied. Based on the RNAseq
data we will focus on the pathomechanism of how viscoelastic changes are sensed by cells, and
the key matricellular signals that confer invasive and migratory properties.
These studies will demonstrate the impact of AGEs on the liver matrix in non-cirrhotic NASH
and outline the pathomechanism for a pro-invasive environment. Defining the key matricellular
signals that drive invasion will enable us to pursue translational studied in the future."

Environmental toxins or endogenous insults such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) result in oxidative
stress within cells, leading to different types of damage in DNA or RNA, including Apurinic/apyrimidinic
(AP) sites and single-strand breaks (SSBs). As the most common type of DNA damage, SSBs have been
implicated in association with tumorigenesis, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. Molecular
understanding of SSB repair pathway remains unclear, largely due to the lack of tractable experimental
systems. We and others have demonstrated recently that APE2 resolves SSB damage in Xenopus and
budding yeast. Although APE1 has been found critical for including DNA repair, redox regulation of
transcription, and RNA processing, it remains unclear how APE2 plays important roles in DNA and RNA
metabolism. It is significant to determine how APE2 plays an essential role in SSB repair, and how exactly
APE2 maintains genome stability. Our substantial preliminary data suggest that APE2’s 3'-5' exonuclease
activity is regulated via its dynamic interactions with single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and its interacting proteins,
and that APE2 associates with RNA and RNA-containing structures such as R-loop. We will dissect the
molecular mechanism of APE2 in metabolism in nucleic acids via two Specific Aims: (1) determine the
mechanism of how APE2 interacts with and processes AP sites and SSBs in DNA structures in
reconstitution system with purified proteins and in Xenopus egg extracts, and (2) determine how APE2
recognizes and repairs AP site and SSBs in RNA or RNA-containing structures. Biochemical, cell biology,
and molecular biology approaches will be utilized to conduct this hypothesis-driven structure-function
analysis of APE2-mediated metabolism of nucleic acids in Xenopus egg extracts and reconstitution
systems with purified proteins. Anticipated results from this project will make a paradigm shift on APE2-
mediated SSB repair in DNA/RNA metabolism to maintain genome stability. Notably, our findings will
provide novel insights into new strategies for cancer chemotherapies such as modulating the distinct
regulatory mechanisms of APE2 for SSB repair in genome integrity."
10890580,"Multi-organ culture and pumping systems for ex vivo models of immunity in hybrid tissue-chips
A better understanding of cellular and molecular communication between the lymph node (LN) and the organs it
drains is imperative for public health. These events determine how well we fight infections and respond to
vaccines, whether a nascent tumor is recognized and destroyed, and whether our own tissues remain safe from
autoimmunity. However, the dynamic interactions of the lymph node with peripheral organs have been difficult
to study in vivo or in vitro, making it difficult to predict immune responses, understand disease mechanisms, or
design vaccines and immunotherapies. Here, we will develop a microfluidic culture and pumping system
specifically designed to model communication between the lymph node and surrounding organs, to model multi-
tissue immunity. This model will build on our prior establishment of a microfluidic system for co-culture of two
slices under a recirculating loop of media, which showed promise in capturing tumor-induced
immunosuppression of the lymph node (Shim, Lab Chip 2019). We will build on this concept to create the first
tissue slice co-culture system that is specifically designed for use by immunologists and other biomedical
researchers in terms of ease of use for precise flow control and circulation of white blood cells between tissues.
First, we will develop a series of 3D printed multi-organ microdevices for culture of intact tissue slices under
transverse or lateral perfusion, with or without an air/liquid interface (e.g. for brain and skin slices), and supporting
recirculation of white blood cells through multiple tissues. In parallel, we will refine the fluidic control system for
robust and user-friendly multi-slice co-cocultures and lymphocyte recirculation, with scale up to dozens of slice
cultures. We will start from our recent prototype on-chip magnetic impeller-based pump, which is compatible with
cell culture incubators and cell recirculation (Cook, Lab Chip 2022). Combining advanced fluid dynamic
simulations with experimental tests, we will miniaturize the pump to reduce dead volume, ensure consistency of
flow control, and preserve viability of circulating white blood cells. User tests in other laboratories will further
refine the design. Making use of the available flow control, we will test the hypothesis that lymph node tissue
function is sensitive to fluid flow rate, and determine the optimal flow mode for multi-organ lymph node culture.
Finally, we will build on our strong team’s expertise in vaccine immunology to generate a simple model of vaccine
drainage and response of the lymph node to vaccination, as a proof-of-principle for the system. Ultimately, the
user-friendly platform developed here to model multi-organ immune function will enable the biomedical research
community to better predict the response to vaccination and immunotherapy, onset of tumor immunity, and
engagement of brain, gut, or arthritic joints with the lymph node during autoimmunity."
10767924,"Plasma membrane proteins, including receptors and nutrient transporters, undergo internalization into the endosomal compartment, from where these proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane. This endosomal recycling process is essential to cellular homeostasis. Our laboratories have discovered two interrelated complexes that play key roles in endosomal recycling known as CCC and retriever. Both of these assemblies work in concert with WASH, an endosomally-localized actin nucleating pentameric complex. Significantly, perturbations of these systems have far-reaching consequences, including developmental anomalies, altered copper and lipid handling, and defective glucose tolerance. These physiologic alterations can be traced to faulty trafficking of key receptors and transporters including Notch, ATP7A/ATP7B, LDLR and GLUT2. At its core, the CCC complex contains COMMD proteins, in association with two coiled-coil proteins, CCDC22 and CCDC93. We recently demonstrated that CCC regulates the WASH complex by limiting the amount of endosomal PI(3)P through an interaction with the PI(3)P phosphatase MTMR2. We also uncovered that the CCC complex recruits a cargo recognition complex, termed retriever, whose function is to identify proteins that need to be recycled. While we made great progress in dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of these systems, our understanding is still rudimentary. The overall goal of this project is to provide a deep mechanistic picture of CCC-mediated regulation of WASH and retriever, focusing our attention on endosomal recycling of nutrient regulators. Based on new emerging data, this proposal will test the hypothesis that the CCC complex coordinates both PI(3)P levels and Rab21 activation to promote retriever-mediated recycling of surface proteins. This project will focus on the following specific aims: (1) Determine the mechanism by which CCC regulates MTMR actions on endosomes. In this aim we will examine how the CCC complex coordinates MTMR actions, particularly by MTMR5, together with activation of Rab21 and retriever recruitment. (2) Define the mechanism by which PI(3)P regulates the recruitment and activity of the WASH complex. In this aim, we will define the mechanisms by which PI(3)P-binding domains in FAM21 and WASH regulate the endosomal recruitment and activity of the WASH complex, and how these activities ultimately impact endosomal trafficking. (3) Examine retriever-dependent regulation of cargo proteins in vivo. In this aim we will utilize newly generated mouse models of retriever deficiency (conditional Vps35l, Vps26c alleles) to examine the contribution of this system to ATP7B and LDLR trafficking in the liver. Furthermore, we will utilize proteomics to define the breadth of plasma membrane proteins regulated by retriever, CCC, and WASH in the mammalian liver. Altogether, this project will elucidate important principles that govern the trafficking of a myriad of cargoes that traverse the endosomal system. Deregulation of these pathways have a broad impact on normal organismal/cellular physiology, thus its scientific impact will have far reaching implications for several biomedical fields."
10781996,"Abstract
Embryonic development is a fascinating process during which different cells types are made and organized into
complex and functional structures, ultimately building an entire organism. If we watch embryos develop, patterns
emerge with remarkable reproducibility. However, if we zoom in to the level of individual cells, the scene,
especially during mammalian development, often seems chaotic. Cells move around, change shape, contact
different neighbors and show fluctuations in their gene expression patterns. Yet from this apparent chaos, robust
and reproducible patterns emerge. How are the right cell types made at the right time and place in correct
proportions? In this proposal we will use a crucial cell fate decision in the preimplantation mouse embryo, when
the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage segregates into the epiblast (EPI) and the primitive endoderm (PE) lineages,
the cell types that will give rise to most of the fetus and extraembryonic cell types, respectively, as a model
system to reveal fundamental insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that ensure robust and
reproducible lineage formation. While studies employing genetic and pharmacological approaches have
established the necessary molecular players involved in EPI and PE cell fates, these are limited in providing
temporal information on an inherently dynamic process. Additionally, ICM cells differentiate into EPI and PE cell
types in a seemingly random pattern, which varies from one embryo to the next, complicating the interpretation
of analysis performed only at fixed time points. Here we develop novel genetically encoded fluorescent reporter
mouse lines for key factors involved in EPI and PE cell fates, which allow us to visualize and probe the
mechanisms of cell fate acquisition with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, using a combination of
cutting-edge live imaging, computational image processing, and genomics approaches. Using these powerful
tools, we will investigate the mechanism driving initial symmetry-breaking in the ICM to initiate EPI/PE lineage
differentiation and determine whether purely stochastic fluctuations or more predictable systematic variations
present in the embryo are responsible for initiating this fate decision. Next, we will determine how cell fates are
propagated over space and time to achieve reproducible cell-type proportions, by uniquely visualizing multiple
nodes in cell-cell communication signaling. Finally, we will use recently developed genomics techniques to probe
transcription factor occupancy and chromatin accessibility to observe how cell type-specific transcriptional
programs are set up by key factors during EPI/PE lineage segregation. This work will uncover fundamental
mechanisms by which variable developmental process can lead to robust and reproducible developmental
patterning in the early mammalian embryo."

prognosis and therapeutic response. The recent development of new small molecule inhibitors of KRAS that
target KRAS mutations frequently observed in PDAC has the potential to transform the treatment of this disease.
We and others have shown that primary and acquired resistance mechanisms can limit the clinical benefit of
KRAS inhibitor monotherapy in cancer; thus, understanding the mechanisms of response and resistance to
KRAS inhibition in PDAC will be critical to maximize the potential of these therapies. This proposal will use novel
mutant-selective KRAS and pan-RAS inhibitors, unique human organoid and mouse models of PDAC, and
innovative single-cell and functional genomic approaches to define the genetic, transcriptional and
microenvironmental factors that impact response to KRAS inhibition in PDAC. In Aim 1 we will investigate how
tumor suppressor genotype can modify response to KRAS inhibition using CRISPR-Cas12a tumor suppressor
gene knockout screens in both in vitro and in vivo systems to simultaneously model multiple PDAC genotypes
and systematically define genetic biomarkers and mechanisms of sensitivity or resistance to KRAS inhibition. In
Aim 2, we will define the role of PDAC transcriptional cell state in modifying response to KRAS inhibition using
novel isogenic murine PDAC organoids and human patient-derived PDAC organoids representing the basal-like,
classical and neuronal-like subtypes of PDAC. We will characterize subtype-specific adaptive mechanisms of
response to KRAS inhibition and evaluate subtype plasticity with a goal to develop combination therapy
strategies with KRAS inhibition to target each subtype. In Aim 3, we will build on preliminary single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from human PDAC biopsies showing that the tumor microenvironment (TME)
shapes the transcriptional phenotype and therapeutic response of PDAC cells. We will examine response to
oncogenic Kras inhibition in new mouse models of the basal-like, classical and neuronal-like subtypes of PDAC
and will interrogate the role of paracrine signaling mechanisms from the TME in modifying malignant cell state
and response to KRAS inhibition using ex vivo scRNA-seq and drug sensitivity profiling assays. Collectively,
these studies will form a foundation for development of new biomarkers and combination therapies with KRAS
inhibition that can be evaluated in future clinical trials for PDAC patients."

The goal of this T32 program is to produce outstanding biomedical scientists who expand the envelope of our
knowledge of the mechanisms, manifestations, prevention, and cures of lung disease. The program combines
intensive training in a single area of investigation within a multidisciplinary academic environment. The training
is available at both the pre- and postdoctoral levels, supporting 2 predoctoral and 14 postdoctoral trainees per
year. A PhD program may be completed in 5 years. At the postdoctoral level, qualified MD, PhD or MD/PhD
candidates complete 2 or more years of training. A wide range of training opportunities are provided by a large
interactive network of faculty supported by individual, collaborative and inter-institutional research grants. These
opportunities include lung-related research in behavioral science, cellular and molecular biology, environmental
exposures, clinical trials, epidemiology, global health, immunology and infection, airway biology, sleep biology
and vascular biology and cellular metabolism. The core of the experience is the close relationship between a
primary mentor, co-mentors and the trainee and integration between bench researchers and physician scientists.
This is supplemented by individual development plans, formal course work, core conferences, training in
responsible research conduct, communication skills, career planning, and grant writing workshops. Postdoctoral
trainees in the clinical sciences can acquire a Masters or Doctoral degree. Trainees and mentors are reviewed
by committees that monitor the training and career development of students and fellows and promotes mentoring
skills. Doctoral students are additionally reviewed by a thesis committee that provides both support and
guidance. Over the last 20 years, for predoctoral graduates, 95% placed into research-intensive or research-
related positions in academia, government or industry, with 95% retention. For postdoctoral graduates, 80% of
graduates received 3 or more years of research training supported by this T32 and 93 individual fellowship
awards. 94% of graduates placed into full-time academic or research positions in government after graduation,
supported by 107 mentored early career awards (K-series and foundation awards). 87% of graduates remain in
academic or research-intensive or research-related positions in industry/government."
10767767,"Pathologic manifestations of diabetic nephropathy (DN) include glomerular and tubular hypertrophy and
matrix protein fibronectin expression. These changes occur concomitant with increased expression of TGFb
(transforming growth factor-b) that contributes to the pathogenesis of human and experimental DN. We
interrogate the molecular signaling events by which high glucose and TGFb drive the pathologies and provide
new potential therapeutic strategies for complications of DN. We have reported that Akt kinase/mTORC1
(mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) axis contributes to renal hypertrophy and fibronectin expression in
mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial (PTE) cells, and in kidneys of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice.
Recently, a novel longer translational variant of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in
chromosome 10), PTEN-Long, a negative regulator of Akt kinase, has been identified as a secretory and
membrane permeable protein. Our preliminary data show markedly reduced levels of PTEN-Long along with
increased Akt kinase activity in the kidney cortex of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice and in high glucose- or
TGFb-treated mesangial and PTE cells. Moreover, we show that high glucose and TGFb activate PDGFRb
(platelet-derived growth factor-b). We find PDGFRb as a substrate for PTEN-Long; thus downregulation of
PTEN-Long results in PDGFRb activation by high glucose and TGFb. Furthermore, in the kidney and in
mesangial and PTE cells, we identify Akt-2 as the predominant isotype of Akt kinase that acts downstream of
PTEN-Long/PDGFRb. Also, Akt-2 is activated in kidneys of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice kidneys. We plan
to exploit the intrinsic protective function of PTEN-long during the progression of DN. In this proposal, using
cultured mesangial and PTE cells and renal tissues from diabetic OVE26 and db/db mice, we will test the
hypothesis that hyperglycemia/TGFb-induced inappropriate downregulation of PTEN-Long results in
PDGFRb/Akt-2 activation that contributes to renal hypertrophy and matrix expansion in diabetic kidney
disease. Probing the novel negative regulatory function of PTEN-Long, we will use it as a therapeutic agent for
DN. In the first specific aim, we will determine the role of PTEN-Long in hypertrophy and, fibronectin and PAI-1
(plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1) expression. In the second aim, how PTEN-Long forces activation of
PDGFRb to regulate mesangial and PTE cell hypertrophy, and matrix protein expression will be investigated.
In specific aim 3, we will study the contribution of Akt-2 isotype to hypertrophy and fibronectin/PAI-1 expression
in response to high glucose and TGFb in mesangial and PTE cells and in diabetic mice kidneys. To address
these aims, techniques including immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, morphometry, immunohistochemistry,
transfection of expression vectors and siRNAs, administration of recombinant therapeutic protein and small
molecule compound will be employed. Our study will establish a network of interconnections involving PTEN-
Long, PDGFRb and Akt-2 for driving DN."
10768609,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating chronic, demyelinating autoimmune diseases of the central nervous
system (CNS). Two key cytokines/chemokines thought to drive the early inflammatory stage of MS to a chronic
progressive phase are macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) and its homolog D-Dopachrome
Tautomerase (D-DT). Our laboratory designed two potent biological constructs called RTL1000 and a second-
generation derivative, DRα1-MOG-35-55, that bind tightly to the MIF receptor, CD74, and competitively inhibit
MIF binding and downstream signaling through phosphorylated extracellular-related kinase (pERK1/2).
RTL1000/DRα1-MOG-35-55 also targets T cell receptors resulting in the inhibition of IL-2 release, T cell and
macrophage activation and their migration into the CNS. Treatment of mice with experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE – an animal model of MS) with DRα1-MOG-35-55 reduces the severity of both the acute
and chronic forms of the disease when administered after onset of clinical signs and also promotes
neuroprotection. New findings obtained during the previous Merit Review funding period have established
several key facts that provide a solid basis for the studies proposed in this resubmission, including: 1) Detailed
understanding of MIF and D-DT molecular interactions with their common receptor, CD74 and their contributions
to acute and chronic EAE disease severity; 2) Discovery and characterization of DRQ, an ~8-fold more potent
variant of DRα1-MOG-35-55 called DRhQ, [DRα1(L50Q)-human (h)MOG-35-55] for human clinical trials and its
homolog, DRmQ, [DRα1(L50Q)-mouse (m)MOG-35-55] that was created for use in rodents; and 3) Demonstration
that DRmQ treatment of acute and chronic EAE not only blocks signaling through the MIF/CD74 axis and the T
cell receptor, but also inhibits additional proinflammatory pathways and promotes neuroprotection. The
hypothesis to be addressed in this renewal application is that DRQ can inhibit inflammatory innate and adaptive
immune pathways and simultaneously stimulate remyelination and neuronal protection. The major goals of the
current grant application are to evaluate possible proinflammatory interactions between the MIF/CD74 axis with
the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) pathway in EAE; and to determine if DRmQ can
block TREM-1, CXCR2 (which inhibits oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation) and the TCR and simultaneously
enhance three neuroprotective pathways involving TREM-2 and several chemokine ligand and receptor pairs
that were implicated in cytokine/chemokine screening studies. This triad spectrum of DRQ inhibition of
MIF/CD74, TREM-1 and encephalitogenic T cell activity coupled with its stimulatory effects on CNS remyelination
and axonal health in EAE will validate the unique therapeutic potential of DRhQ for MS and allow this novel
“designer” drug to compete favorably with current and future monoclonal antibody and other currently approved
therapies for MS that are directed at single target molecules."

As Americans enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also in a mental health crisis. Emerging
adults in particular are experiencing a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, suicidality, and psychosis
compared to pre-pandemic levels. A slowed economy, increased social isolation, loss of typical support systems,
and financial instability abruptly hit just as emerging adults were transitioning from adolescence to adulthood,
potentially disrupting typical milestones such as leaving home, pursuing higher education, starting vocations,
and becoming financially independent. The pandemic has also underscored persistent health inequalities that
exist between White Americans and racial/ethnic minorities, due at least in part to experiences of discrimination.
Living in poverty is an additional risk factor for mental health problems, and is a vastly different experience for
White and minoritized individuals due to environmental and social factors afforded to different racial/ethnic
groups. In addition, neighborhood characteristics and community type (i.e., rural, urban) can intersect with
racial/ethnic identity to increase risk or offer protection from mental health problems. The genetically-informative
Early Steps Multisite (ESM) study of 731 racially/ethnically diverse low-income families presents a unique
opportunity to examine how a sample of at-risk emerging adults, prospectively followed since age two and now
in their early twenties, are coping within the context of the pandemic. The ESM sample was recruited at Women,
Infant, and Children centers in three geographically, socioeconomically, and racially/ethnically diverse
communities: Eugene, OR; Pittsburgh, PA; and Charlottesville, VA. Participating families were randomly
assigned to receive the Family Check-Up (FCU) intervention annually from child age 2 to 10.5, or to participate
in study assessments without intervention. Assessments continued at child ages 14, 16, and 19, including two
pandemic-related surveys focused on mental health, and participant genotyping. Recruited from diverse sites,
the ESM can examine community- and neighborhood-level effects on mental health risk and resilience.
Continuing this longitudinal study, we will assess participants at ages 22 and 24, including a clinical diagnostic
interview of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. With a wealth of prospective data on neighborhood risk,
experiences of discrimination, and mental health, we propose to examine direct, interactive, and cascading
effects on mental health outcomes. Our first aim is to investigate whether race/ethnicity and discriminatory
experiences shift the developmental trajectories of mental health, and whether protective ecological factors
mitigate these risks. Our second aim is to test genetic moderation of risk and resilience on emerging adult mental
health. Our third aim is to examine the long-term preventive effects of the FCU on mental health, in the context
of growing up in poverty, and, more recently, the pandemic, while focusing on who is able to glean the largest
benefit from this intervention. Following this emerging adult sample would provide unique data on the persistence
of intervention effects on mental health during the transition to adulthood in the context of a pandemic."

Neutralizing antibodies are critical for protection from infectious diseases. The lymph node (LN) germinal center
(GC) is the site where B cells undergo antibody affinity maturation and develop into long-lived plasma cells – key
events that are required for the development of highly effective neutralizing antibodies following infection or
vaccination. T follicular helper cells (TFH) are the CD4+ T cell subset responsible for providing B cell help during
an ongoing GC. TFH are absolutely required for GC formation and maintenance. By extension, TFH are necessary
to produce effective neutralizing antibodies following antigen exposure. While many aspects of the TFH response
and TFH function have been examined in animal models, human TFH responses in the draining LN have only
recently been explored with the novel application of an established technique: serial ultrasound-guided fine
needle aspiration of draining LN following vaccination. With this technique, we recently demonstrated that the
antigen-specific TFH response to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mRNA vaccination persists in the GC for more
than 4 months following vaccination and correlates with the presence of S-specific GC B cells. Furthermore, we
have noted substantial LN TFH transcriptional phenotypic changes suggestive of functional maturation over this
prolonged GC time interval using single cell RNA-seq in a small preliminary cohort. In this proposal, we will
expand upon these findings to address our primary hypothesis: human TFH phenotypic maturation occurs over
time in the draining LN following vaccination and these phenotypic changes are associated with changes in TFH
function. To explore this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1) We will first establish that TFH phenotypic
maturation occurs over time in multiple antigen-specific TFH populations that we will define and characterize from
a cohort of fourteen COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients using single cell RNA-seq and ex vivo epitope
identification methods. 2) We will determine how these antigen-specific TFH populations change in a tertiary
immune response following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine “boost” and continued serial LN sampling of the same
cohort participants. We will also ascertain if new antigen-specific TFH populations are recruited to the GC during
a recall response. 3) Finally, we will verify that the profound phenotypic changes we observe lead to changes in
the functional capacity of antigen-specific TFH to provide help to B cells using an ex vivo system of sorted human
LN TFH and an in vivo murine adoptive transfer model. By addressing these aims, we will significantly enhance
our understanding of the role that human TFH play in directing GC B cell responses to vaccination."

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are two of the most
devastating human malignancies in desperate need for improved treatment concepts. Treatment resistance in
cancer therapy frequently includes, among others, reduced drug uptake, increased drug efflux, improved
adaptation to chemotherapy-induced stress/DNA damage and inhibition of apoptosis. An example of such a
resistance mechanism is the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (XIAP), a potent negative regulator of
caspases and promoter of cancer cell survival in both ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Inhibition of XIAP has
been studied to increase apoptosis and to overcome drug resistance in vitro and in preclinical mouse models.
Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) is an endogenous inhibitor of both XIAP and
cellular IAP (cIAP) by reactivating caspase activity (XIAP blockade) and cIAP degradation, leading to cancer
cell death. These findings have initiated the development of synthetic small molecule mimics of endogenous
SMAC, which have been studied in a wide variety of human malignancies either as single agents but also in
combination with systemic chemotherapy as a means to further improve patient outcomes.
The foundation of our work with respect to small molecule drug development is based on sigma-2 ligands (S2)
that facilitate fast and selective uptake into the cancer cells due to ~10-fold higher abundancy of the
corresponding sigma-2 receptor (S2R) compared to normal host cells. By generating chemical conjugates
between S2 and a variety of small molecule drug cargos, we are now capable of delivering therapeutic
payloads more efficiently and selectively than their non-targeted counterparts to the tumors (targeted therapy).
LCL161 is a clinically explored IAP inhibitor (IAPinh) that induces target activation but failed to demonstrate
objective responses in patients. In this grant, we propose to study an innovative experimental cancer
therapeutic by chemically linking IAPinh (LCL161) to S2 ligand SW43, resulting in S2/IAPinh for tumor-
selective drug delivery and therapy. We hypothesize that S2/IAPinh can be combined with systemic, low-dose
chemotherapy to result in synergistic treatment regimens that lead to tumor eradication while systemic
toxicities are reduced to a minimum.
The overall goal of our current study is to find effective therapies for ovarian and pancreatic cancer. The
proposed aims maximize the chance that a novel drug candidate, S2/IAPinh, will be effective clinically. This is
envisioned either as single-agent, low-dose S2/IAPinh therapy in the context of a TNF-α gene signature in
patient tumors or as combination regimens with clinically approved pathway enhancers, such as Nab-paclitaxel
(Abraxane) (ovarian cancer) and Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel (pancreatic cancer) but also statin-based
inhibitors of cholesterol de novo synthesis. Our new findings represent an exciting innovative opportunity to
enhance the activity profile of S2/IAPinh employing novel drug combinations for the benefit of cancer patients."
10794956,"Pathogenic antibodies promote and exacerbate allergic inflammation. Antibody responses are controlled by a
delicate balance between stimulatory signals from T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and inhibitory signals from T
follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. Alterations in this balance can lead to pathogenic antibody responses and
disease. Although subsets of Tfh and Tfr cells have been implicated in controlling allergies, the precise
mechanisms of how these cells regulate distinct stages of allergic inflammation are not currently known. We
hypothesize that individual subsets of Tfh and Tfr cells have unique and multifaceted roles during distinct stages
of allergic inflammation. Moreover, we hypothesize that the composition of Tfh and Tfr subsets evolves over
time to orchestrate allergic disease. By elucidating how Tfh and Tfr cell subsets control allergic inflammation,
new strategies can be developed that specifically target pathogenic responses during allergies without affecting
broad immune responses. To test these hypotheses, we have developed a number of novel mouse models for
the in-depth study of the roles of specialized subsets of Tfh and Tfr cells in allergies. Our aims are to 1)
Determine how Tfr cells control allergic inflammation through regulating B, Tfh13 and Tfh21 cells; and 2) Assess
how the evolving composition of unique Tfh cell subsets orchestrates allergic inflammation. Our goals are to
elucidate mechanisms used by Tfh and Tfr cell subsets to regulate allergies, and to identify targeted strategies
to limit allergic inflammation."

Technological breakthroughs in single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled atomic
structure determinations of many challenging biological macromolecules in an unprecedented rapid pace. It also
facilitated addressing challenging structural biology questions that would otherwise be difficult to address.
Beyond atomic structures, protein dynamics and conformational transitions between functional states are among
questions that are particularly suited to be studied by single particle cryo-EM.
TRPV1 ion channel is polymodal nociceptor that integrates signals generated from a range of biochemical and
biophysical stimuli. It is biochemically well-behaved and physiologically and pharmacologically well characterized.
With various endogenous stimuli and natural exogenous compounds trapping the channel in various functional
states, we have determined structures of TRPV1 in various stable conformations. In the next step, we will use
TRPV1 as a model system to exploit using novel cryo-EM advances to probe the range of conformational states
sampled by this complex signal integrator. For many other TRP channels, in which there is no suitable
pharmacological tools to trap the channels in specific stable conformations, methods developed with the model
system can be used to study mechanisms of channel gating."

Defining how allergen-specific, memory Th2 cells develop and function has the potential to change our
therapeutic approach to allergic asthma, the most common asthma subtype. Th2 cells are a dominant source of
type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which orchestrate inflammation in murine models and humans with allergic
asthma. In addition, allergen-specific, memory Th2 cells persist in vivo, driving recurrent allergic inflammation
upon allergen re-exposure. We recently showed that tissue-resident memory Th2 cells (Th2 Trm) that durably
persist in the lungs are a transcriptionally distinct memory Th2 cell subset that is critical for orchestrating recurrent
allergic airway inflammation (Rahimi et al., Journal of Experimental Medicine, 2020). Identifying the mechanisms
promoting the development and function of Th2 Trm has the potential to yield new therapeutic targets for allergic
asthma. The objective of this proposal is to define the role of the transcription factor PPARg and lipid shuttling
in tissue-resident memory Th2 cell development, identity, and function in a murine model of allergic asthma.
PPARg is a lipid sensor and nuclear receptor family member, which orchestrates lipid metabolism. Compared to
other CD4+ T helper cells, effector Th2 cells exhibit markedly higher expression of PPARg. PPARg activity during
initial Th2 differentiation suppresses a Th17 cell program and is required for Th2 cell effector function. A diverse
group of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ligands, including arachidonic acid and eicosanoids, bind PPARg and
promote its transcriptional activity. The central role of PPARg in Th2 cell differentiation and effector function
raises important questions regarding the regulation of PPARg activity in Th2 Trm development and function:
Does the degree of PPARg activity in effector Th2 cells regulate differentiation into Th2 Trm? Given that PUFA
ligands are required for PPARg transcriptional activity, do Th2 Trm depend on PUFA stores that can be used to
maintain and upregulate PPARg transcriptional activity during recall responses? In this proposal, we will test the
hypothesis that persistent PPARg transcriptional activity promotes Th2 Trm development. We further
hypothesize that storage of PUFAs in Th2 cells is required to maintain PPARg activity and promote Th2 Trm
development and function. Specifically, we propose to (1) define the role of persistent PPARg activity in Th2 Trm
development and identity and (2) define the role of lipid storage and shuttling in Th2 Trm development and
function. We propose novel experimental approaches to test our model that persistent PPARg activity, which is
maintained by intracellular stores of PUFAs, promotes Th2 Trm development and function. Defining the
mechanisms whereby peripheral tissues are imprinted with allergen-specific, Th2 Trm has great potential to
identify novel therapeutic targets for allergic diseases including asthma."
10786117,"In the United States, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent the leading preventable cause of birth
defects and neurodevelopmental delay with life-long implications. FASD affects an estimated 40,000 infants in
the US each year, with 2-5% of younger school-age children having FASD. Currently, prediction of FASD
during pregnancy is not available, and there are no readily available cures against FASD. It is widely believed
that early detection of FASD and its subsequent intervention strategies are critical to allow earliest and most
effective therapeutic interventions. While fetal alcohol exposure targets multiple organs and systems, the brain
constitutes the most severely affected organ, exhibiting both structural and functional abnormalities. As
neuronal development critically depends on the oxygen delivery, nutritional supply and waste removal by
cerebral circulation, recent studies have been paying increasing attention to the fetal cerebral circulation as a
critical target of maternal alcohol consumption. However, the timing and mechanisms that govern fetal
cerebrovascular response to alcohol remain elusive. One of the major obstacles that preclude rapid
advancement of the studies on fetal cerebral circulation is lack of high-resolution imaging technique that would
be suitable for imaging of small lab animal species. Current proposal is put forth by the collaborating teams of
bioengineers and cerebrovascular physiologists with the overall goal of delivering a high-speed 3D
photoacoustic tomography (PAT) that will allow non-invasive, simultaneous visualization of all the embryos in a
mouse utero and track their development into adulthood longitudinally to study the association between alcohol
exposure-induced changes in fetal hemodynamics and cerebrovascular outcome after birth. Another obstacle
to developing effective treatments to alleviate symptoms and develop preventive measures against FASD is a
relatively limited knowledge on relevant targets for alcohol, including targets within fetal cerebral arteries. In
this regard, current proposal will focus on cerebral artery mitochondria. Critical role of mitochondria in
regulating cerebral artery function is well documented, and there is no doubt that mitochondrial is one of the
major sensors for alcohol as shown in liver and neurons. In our recent pioneered work we documented
persistent up-regulation of fetal cerebral artery proteome in response to alcohol exposure during mid-
pregnancy. However, systematic studies on cerebral artery mitochondria alterations in response to prenatal
alcohol exposure remain to be performed and the role of alcohol targeting of fetal cerebral artery mitochondria
remains to be established. To overcome these obstacles in the field, we propose to complete three related
Aims: (1) We will optimize a high-speed PAT system for 3D high-resolution brain imaging of rodents; (2) We
will develop advanced software for improved PAT 3D image reconstruction and analysis; (3) We will trace
cerebrovascular morphological and functional changes following fetal alcohol exposure into adulthood, with the
focus on fetal cerebral vessel density, artery diameter and mitochondrial function."

Mitochondrial disease is a commonly occurring inherited condition, incidence 1/5000, which can affect every
organ system and thus exhibits a broad range of clinical phenotypes. The most common are neurological and
neuromuscular dysfunction that manifest as neurodegeneration, seizures, ataxia, chronic progressive
external opthalmoplegia (CPEO), and hypotonia. Childhood-onset mitochondrial disease most often results
from mutations in the nuclear genome; however, the majority of cases remain without a molecular diagnosis
and no effective treatments thus underscoring the critical need to identify the genetic aberrations driving these
disorders. We propose a personalized functional genomics approach combining genome-wide sequencing,
transcriptomics, metabolomics and mitochondrial functional profiling in cells to identify validated novel
mitochondrial disease genes and variants. We will leverage a multi-omic strategy for identifying the
pathogenic genes and elucidating pathomechanisms: 1. Genome-wide sequencing of patients coupled with
transcriptomics and metabolomics 2. Cell-based functional studies of genes and pathways identified in
patients. Through our international network of collaborators we have collected patients with clinically
confirmed primary mitochondrial encephalopathy who do not have a molecular diagnosis. For patients who
have already had WES/WGS but no molecular diagnosis we will re-interpret these data and leverage our
ability to interpret beyond ABMGG guidelines for diagnosis. Additionally, we have a parallel effort to identify
disease genes through datamining the clinical exome database at Baylor Genetics diagnostic laboratory
wherein genes that are known to be essential for mitochondrial function but are not yet demonstrated as
disease causing are analyzed for mutations in patients. Gene causality will be determined through a series of
cell-based disease modeling experiments of mitochondrial functional profiling that include strategies of gene
knock down, high-throughput mutagenesis knock-in, and cDNA complementation studies. We will utilize this
technology to test the functionality of variants of uncertain significance identified in our sequencing efforts as
well as those obtained through collaborators, diagnostic laboratories, and the public domain. This work will
generate an unprecedented resource of systematic profiling of cellular mitochondrial function and functionally-
confirmed pathogenic molecular defects. The elucidation of these pathogenic genes and variants will
immediately improve the molecular diagnostic potential for children with suspected mitochondrial disease.
Moreover, by identifying the pathogenic genes for primary mitochondrial encephalopathy we will empower the
scientific community focused on neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, which have a more complex
etiology, by delivering genes and pathways for further study of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these global
health problems."
10770571,"The objective of the proposed R01 project is to build on our recent findings that attractive odors from sources of
nectar activate conserved olfactory channels in mosquitoes, and the odorant ratios within the scent, along with
the inhibition in the antennal lobe (AL), are critical for Aedes aegypti behavior. Feeding on fruits and flowers is
a vital behavior for mosquitoes, and mosquito attraction to these sources of nectar is mediated by the ratio of
key odorants in the bouquet. Bait-and-kill traps that use fruit syrups have effectively controlled local mosquito
populations, but variation in the fruit odor can strongly impact its attractiveness. We still have not identified the
odor constituents and ratios that are attractive in the nectar odors – enabling the development of synthetic lures
–, nor how this information is detected and processed by the mosquito's olfactory system.
 Nectar-feeding by female mosquitoes increases their life-span and decreases the gonotrophic cycle, thereby
increasing their vectorial capacity, and for adult males, it is the only source of nutrients. Our recent work allowed
us to identify the odor constituents that mediate nectar-feeding behaviors in Ae. aegypti and understand how the
odor is processed in the brain. Now in this application, we propose to use a combination of behavioral assays,
chemical methods combined with calcium imaging in tethered flying mosquitoes, and genetic approaches to
study the olfactory basis of nectar-seeking behaviors. Aim 1 will allow us to identify attractive odorants in the
scents of diverse plant nectar sources and use heterologous expression systems to de-orphan the cognate
odorant receptors (Ors). We also take advantage of the Q-system for genetically characterizing three Ors (Or15,
Or49, and Or2) that are essential for representing the proper ratios in nectar odors. In Aim 2, we leverage our
existing and new GCaMP expression lines to examine how the ratios of these key odorants are processed in the
AL, and how GABAergic inhibition shapes these responses. In Aim 3, we will use our identified odor lures, and
artificial lures that vary in their natural ratios of key odorants, to determine their efficacy in bait-and-kill systems.
Together, these experiments will test the working hypothesis that nectar odors and their specific odorant ratios
activate conserved olfactory channels to be processed similarly by AL circuits to mediate feeding behaviors.
 While there has been an extensive study of mosquito attraction to blood hosts, we know comparatively less
about nectar feeding. Our experiments will identify new odors that can be immediately deployed as attractant
lures. Additionally, GABAergic systems are involved in diverse physiological processes in insect vectors,
including olfaction, immune response, and arbovirus replication, as well as being potent targets for insecticides.
Generating mutants that target the mosquito's olfactory responses or GABAergic pathways could provide
additional insight into these diverse processes. Sugar feeding plays an essential role in the vectorial capacity of
mosquitoes and the spread of diseases that afflict over a billion people annually. Therefore, unraveling the
neural bases of nectar-feeding will enable new gene-targets and tools for their control."

Over 750,000 people in the US have kidney failure, and most are treated with hemodialysis. Despite evidence-
based guidelines recommending hemodialysis initiation via an arteriovenous (AV) vascular access (fistula or
graft), 80% of US patients start hemodialysis with a central venous catheter, resulting in significant morbidity,
mortality, and healthcare system expense. Additionally, there are stark racial disparities in the timely creation
of AV access. Black patients are 20% less likely than White patients to start hemodialysis with a fistula despite,
on average, being younger and having fewer comorbidities. Patients report delaying AV access surgery
because of fear, reluctance to start dialysis, and worries about disfigurement, needles, and pain, as well as
having an insufficient understanding of vascular access. To date, interventions aiming to increase uptake of the
evidence-based recommendation for pre-dialysis AV access creation have focused on systems rather than
patients, leaving unmet the well-documented educational and emotional needs of patients. Our central
hypothesis is that strengthening patient preparedness through tailored AV access education and support will
improve rates of AV access creation prior to hemodialysis initiation and reduce racial disparities. Applying well-
established frameworks, we will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study of a user-tested,
efficacious education package that provides vascular access health information and validates common patient
emotions, with and without augmentation through motivational interviewing (MI). Specifically, we will conduct a
3-arm, parallel group, randomized trial of 3 education strategies: focused vascular access education
(Education), MI-enhanced vascular access education (Education-Plus), and no focused vascular access
education (Usual Care) among patients with advanced CKD at two health systems to 1) compare the
effectiveness of Education, Education-Plus, and Usual Care for increasing the proportion of patients with pre-
dialysis AV access creation, and 2) identify factors influencing the implementation of the education strategies in
order to guide their equitable translation to the non-trial setting. We will evaluate the education strategies by
examining relevant elements of the RE-AIM framework: Reach, Effectiveness, and Implementation.
Importantly, we will determine whether and why these elements differ for Black and White patients. This
research will yield critical effectiveness data about patient-focused education strategies to improve vascular
access outcomes, and actionable information about implementation that will accelerate the equitable uptake of
our findings, address disparities in vascular access care, and inform the delivery of other education content to
patients with advanced CKD."

mediate conscious perception, while others serve non-imaging forming functions, such as circadian
photoentrainment and guiding motor movements. However, there is little agreement about which of the more
than 20 ganglion cell types are responsible for specific visual functions. Similarly, little is understood about the
retinal circuits contributing to the diverse tasks outside the human perceptual experience. These represent
fundamental gaps in knowledge that must be filled to provide information necessary to guide efforts to preserve
or restore visual functions such as object recognition without inadvertently interfering with essential non-image-
forming functions. Thus, the long-term objective of the work proposed here is to fill these gaps in knowledge by
making tangible progress on two key issues.
First, the ability to see and recognize objects requires a diversity of cells carrying different information to
specific brain areas involved in conscious vision. For example, the shapes and boundaries of objects in a
visual scene are represented by the percepts of black, white, shades of gray, and color. Specific Aim 1 is to
test the hypothesis that previously unappreciated features of the midget circuitry, both in the inner and outer
plexiform layers, carry out the initial computations responsible for color and black and white vision, and that
this is done by circuitry that separates midget ganglion cells into six types corresponding to the sensations of
red, green, blue, yellow, black, and white, each of which are associated with signaling surface reflectance, not
merely the spectral properties of light in the retinal image.
Second, 3D reconstructions of primate retina using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM)
have revealed an unexpected diversity and quantity of retinal ganglion cell types carrying short-wavelength (S)
cone signals. The S-cone connectome includes redundant color-coding ganglion cells that project to many
brain areas providing the same color information for a broad range of functions besides conscious color vision.
Specific Aim 2 is to gain a complete understanding of all the types of retinal ganglion cells carrying S-cone
signals in the primate retina, the circuitry responsible for their response characteristics, and the role each plays
in guiding our behaviors. This will be done using SBFSEM and single-cell electrophysiology."
10708936,"ABSTRACT
 Within each mammalian cell is a core set of circadian clock proteins that regulate the cellular biology
supporting more complex organ physiologies. The central nervous system, entrained by the principle
environmental cue – light, synchronizes these peripheral cellular ‘clocks’ across the entire organism, which
enables the host organism to anticipate and prepare for the stresses of the active day (e.g., metabolic
demands, septic threat). The current evidence, including data derived from our own research program,
highlight the profound influence individual clock proteins have on the physiologic capacity with which an
organism responds to stress. We first identified that the spectrum of light is a critical determinant of its effects
on mammalian biology, and that the short wavelength visible blue spectrum favorably modifies the
biology and outcome of sepsis. In murine models of intraabdominal sepsis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP)
pneumonia, exposure to blue light after sepsis enhanced immune competence, as evidenced by more efficient
clearance of bacteria from the septic focus, reduced bacterial dissemination, and attenuated systemic
inflammation. The mechanism involved an optic-cholinergic pathway that induced the clock protein Rev-Erba
in immune tissues of the spleen and Mj. A Rev-Erba agonist similarly enhance immune function in both in vitro
and in vivo studies. Our overarching hypothesis is that the cellular state of the clock protein Rev-Erba is
a critical determinant of immune competence and can be modulated to improve the outcome of sepsis.
We specifically hypothesize that Rev-Erba regulates the protein machinery supporting the immune
phenotype of the mononuclear phagocyte and B cell and is vital to an efficient immune response to
microbial threat.
 In Aim 1 we will study the physiologic and cellular mechanisms by which blue light and the clock protein
Rev-Erba regulate monocyte recruitment to the spleen and peripheral tissues and differentiation into a type of
monocyte highly efficient in bacterial clearance, using a model of KP pneumonia. In Aim 2, we will explore the
mechanisms by which blue light and Rev-Erba modulate B cell PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling and actin assembly
to mediate B cell differentiation, activation, MHC II antigen presentation, and antibody production. As these
mechanisms are metabolically demanding and ATP-dependent, we will (Aim 3) determine the mechanisms by
which Rev-Erba modulates mitochondrial dynamics to support oxidative metabolism and thereby the
phenotype of immune cells during sepsis.
 The ramifications of light on health and disease remain to be convincingly defined. This proposal will define
the biological mechanisms through which circadian clock proteins beneficially alter the host response to acute
infectious insult. We will define the dimensions of light and state of clock proteins that are optimally protective
and examine their biological relevance and potential therapeutic value in studies of patients with pneumonia."
10754936,"Project Summary/Abstract
Child-onset hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD) is a genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative
diseases characterized by reduced cerebral myelin formation. Clinical features include cognitive as well as
motor impairment appearing in childhood. There are no curative treatments. Our collaborator, Dr. Grace Yoon,
evaluated two siblings presenting with severe neurological deficit and a shared phenotype consisting of global
developmental delay and intellectual disability, prenatal onset undergrowth and microcephaly, rotatory
nystagmus, ataxia and progressive gait disturbance/spasticity, and hypomyelination on brain MRI. Whole
exome sequencing revealed homozygosity of a c.4444C>A mutation in the EPRS1 gene. The mutation is in
the coding sequence (cds) of the gene causing a Pro-to-Thr point mutation at aa position 1482. The EPRS1
gene encodes the bifunctional, glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS1) that resides in the cytoplasmic multi-
tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). The P1482T mutation is located near the C-terminus of the protein in a
region of the Pro synthetase outside the catalytic or anti-codon recognition domains. The specific activity of
recombinant P1482T mutant EPRS1 is indistinguishable from wild-type. In contrast, EPRS1 protein expression
in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from affected siblings is about 20% of that in unaffected
controls. EPRS1 mRNA levels are identical in siblings and controls indicating post-transcriptional regulation.
Our preliminary studies show a dual mechanism determining diminished EPRS1 level in affected LCLs,
namely, decreased nuclear export of mutant mRNA, followed by decreased cytoplasmic translation. We show
that decreased EPRS1 expression causes release of other MSC constituents. Remarkably, suppression of
several other MSC components causally implicated in HLD also induce MSC constituent release, suggesting a
common etiology of an entire class of HLDs. We hypothesize that inefficient nuclear export and translation of
c.4444C>A EPRS1 mRNA reduces MSC-bound EPRS1, causing release of MSC constituents and driving the
HLD phenotype. Likewise, defects in genes encoding other MSC constituents share a common pathway and
etiology of HLD. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing these Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will elucidate
molecular mechanisms underlying reduced expression of EPRS1P1482T variant, focusing on the role of m6A
methylation. Aim 2 determines the HLD-related phenotype of our newly generated, genetically-modified
Eprs1P1482T mice. In Aim 3 we will investigate effect of deficiency of MSC constituents on MSC integrity and
adverse consequences in myelinating oligodendrocytes. A CNS-specific transcriptomic analysis will be done by
single-nucleus RNA-sequencing. Completion of these studies will elucidate a unique mechanism of gene
dysregulation that induces HLD, and will provide a unique mouse model of HLD that will permit detailed in vivo
analysis of the cellular defects in HLD. Importantly, these results suggest the possibility of specific, RNA-based
therapeutic intervention to rescue translation of the variant EPRS1 mRNA and rescue the neurologic defect."
10805515,"Minority youth are at elevated risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) relative to non-Hispanic whites (NHW), with
African-Americans (AA) and Hispanic-Americans (HA) showing the greatest increase in prevalence since 2000.
Our overarching hypothesis is that underlying genetic differences in minority children interact with
environmental factors in an adverse manner to increase risk for T2D. For example, the elevated beta-cell
responsiveness and reduced hepatic insulin extraction exhibited by AA may increase risk for obesity and beta-
cell dysfunction in the context of a diet high in sugar and processed starches. HA have both a genetic
predisposition to fatty liver, due to a mutation in the carbohydrate-responsive PNPLA3 gene, and a genetic
impairment in the ability to expand peripheral adipose tissue. In the context of weight gain and a high-
sugar/processed carbohydrate diet, these genetic factors may increase risk for insulin resistance. The global
purpose of RFA-DK-21-002 is to identify factors that predict conversion to T2D, and that disproportionately
predispose minority youth to T2D. With our “University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Clinical Center,” we
propose to recruit, phenotype, and follow for 5 years 100 at-risk youth aged 8-16 yr without T2D at baseline
comprised primarily of AA children with extreme obesity. Our team excels in assessment of insulin sensitivity
and beta-cell function; assessment of body composition and body fat distribution; evaluation of the intrauterine
environment; and conducting longitudinal cohort studies with high retention. Published data indicate that the
greatest risk factors for pediatric T2D are extreme obesity (BMI z score > 2.5), impaired glucose tolerance (2-h
glucose >140 mg/dL and <200 mg/dL), weight gain, and family or maternal/gestational history of diabetes. We
will assess all of these variables with annual testing visits that will include an oral glucose tolerance test and
dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for body composition and fat distribution. In addition, we will collect
genetic material for assessment of targeted SNPs with known association to T2D risk, and we will assess
environmental factors such as psychosocial variables and diet. Sera/plasma will be archived for future
metabolomics. Prediction models will be developed for incident T2D, as well as for prevalent and incident IGT,
using suites of anthropometric/demographic, phenotypic, and genotypic variables. We hypothesize that
ethnicity/race will not be statistically related to incident T2D when accounting for genotypic and/or phenotypic
factors that affect risk for T2D, and their potential interaction with environmental factors. Results from this
study will identify the genetic underpinnings of the phenotypic and anthropometric/familial factors that
associate with, and reflect the pathophysiology of, IGT and T2D, and will determine whether these
determinants differ with ethnicity/race. As such, the results of this study will identify targets for intervention,
and markers for monitoring intervention effectiveness, that can be utilized in subsequent intervention studies."
10906365,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
While localized primary pain conditions are prevalent in youth, a significant subset of these patients experience
multiple pain conditions and meet the criteria for chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs). COPCs have a
marked negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life in youth and carry a high risk for continued pain
and disability into adulthood. The underlying factors contributing to the development and persistence of
COPCs in youth are unknown. The current proposal offers an innovative and previously unexplored approach
to determine whether disruptions in spatial (concurrent noxious stimuli across the body) and temporal (noxious
stimuli presented over time) filtering of nociceptive processing, reflecting pain amplification (e.g., increased
facilitation and/or reduced inhibition), contribute to COPCs. Several quantitative sensory testing methods are
uniquely positioned to probe disruptions in nociceptive filtering across spatial (spatial summation, SS;
conditioned pain modulation, CPM) and temporal (temporal summation, TS; offset analgesia, OFA) domains.
Our recent pilot studies found evidence for greater disruptions in spatial (CPM) and temporal (TS) filtering in
youth with COPCs. Our primary objective is to determine if spatial and temporal filtering of nociceptive
information differentiates youth with COPCs from those with localized pain and healthy controls and determine
whether distinct profiles of disrupted nociceptive processing are associated with the transition of localized pain
to COPCs. To accomplish this, the current study will leverage expertise and a vast clinical infrastructure
(Migraine, Gastroenterology, Rheumatology and Pain Management clinics) at a large pediatric medical center
to enroll 140 youth with a localized pain condition (migraine, abdominal pain, local MSK), and 140 youth with
COPC’s. We will also recruit 140 healthy youth to serve as a control group. Following initial phenotyping to
delineate disruptions in spatial and temporal dimensions of nociceptive processing (Aim 1), participants will be
assessed for changes in pain status (localized to COPCs) every three months for one year (Aim 2). In Aim 1,
we hypothesize that youth with COPCs will show disrupted spatial (reflected by reduced CPM and enhanced
SS) and temporal (reflected by enhanced TS and reduced OFA) processing compared to youth with localized
pain and healthy controls. These findings will delineate specific disruptions of nociceptive processing in
patients with COPCs. For Aim 2, we hypothesize that a subset of youth with localized pain and disrupted
spatial and temporal filtering will develop COPCs. We will examine the stability of spatial and temporal filtering
at clinically relevant time points (3-, 6-, and 12-months). We will also explore whether other factors, including
concomitant treatments, influence the disrupted filtering and the transition to COPCs. Our research will provide
the first insight into the presence and impact of disrupted nociceptive filtering related to COPCs and its
naturalistic progression from localized pain. This information will be critical in identifying risk patterns that can
be useful in the prevention of progression to COPCs and mitigating long-term risk."

Social life profoundly influences health. The ability to treat and prevent illness and improve human health
therefore requires a detailed understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the influence of social
complexity on biological systems. Such understanding is key to the development of new interventions to
improve public health. Past studies have demonstrated the critical contribution of social relationships in
shaping health outcomes but are limited in application because such studies rarely consider social support or
health as “complex systems”. As a result, we lack a deep understanding of how and why individuals within
families, and families within communities, remain healthy or become unhealthy in the context of their social
environments. In this application, our proposed research overcomes this limitation by adopting an intervention-
based experimental and computational systems science approach that provides methods uniquely suited to
elucidate the complex mechanisms by which social systems influence health by modeling short- and longer
term integrative effects of social life on health in a proven nonhuman primate model."

 The overall objective of this project is to develop novel approaches to sample, identify, and quantify
proteins secreted into the brain extracellular space in relation to substance use disorders (SUD). The
progression to compulsive drug consumption is associated with changes in neuronal structure and
neurotransmitter release in response to drugs. Evidence suggests that proteins in the extracellular space play
a role in these changes. For example, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) released to the extracellular
space may stimulate neuronal changes that are associated with adaptation to drugs of abuse; however,
practically no direct measures of proteins in the brain extracellular space have been made. The ability to track
release of certain neurotransmitters in vivo has dramatically advanced over the past 2 decades and led to
profound increases in our understanding of how their release is altered by and contributes to SUD. Opening a
window onto how proteins dynamically change will provide even greater insights. A powerful approach to
monitoring is in vivo sampling coupled to analytical techniques. This approach, exemplified by microdialysis
sampling, has been instrumental in uncovering dynamics of dopamine and other small molecules in brain
function and substance abuse. This method has been less successful for tracking proteins due to low
recoveries of these molecules. Low recovery is due to low diffusion of proteins to the sampling device and
adsorption to dialysis membranes. Such probes are also too large to sample many brain nuclei. Here we
describe novel sampling systems that will have higher recovery for proteins at spatial resolution that is 1000-
fold better than microdialysis. We will develop a new sampling method that induces electrically driven flow
through the brain to drive proteins into a sampling capillary. This electroosmotic push-pull perfusion (EOPPP)
probe will be tested for its ability to recover proteins. The effectiveness of this method will be compared to
another new probe based on low-flow push-pull perfusion. In this method, a microfabricated probe, tens of
micrometers in width and thickness, has a single channel to withdraw sample and a second to deliver
replacement fluid at ~100 nL/min.
 After testing and development of these sampling probes, we will then develop proteomic methods to
analyze the extracellular proteome. These methods will be based on microscale sample preparation to digest
proteins to component peptides, advanced high-resolution separation of peptides, and state-of-the art
proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry and informatics. We will identify extracellular proteins in the nucleus
accumbens and prefrontal cortex for the first time. We will then compare the extracellular proteome in controls
to that found in animals trained to self-administer cocaine, a validated model of SUD. This work will uncover
new neural substrates of SUD and set the stage for further exploration of the brain proteome in SUD models.

10734069,"Age is one of the major risk factors for the development of Type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms underlying
this risk are unknown. Diabetes risk is enhanced by obesity, a condition that increases through the lifespan.
This has led us to hypothesize that increased diabetes risk with aging and obesity may be related to changes
in adipocyte function associated with these physiologic states. We have shown that adipocyte maturation was
dependent on the upregulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), a PFK2
isoform that is a regulator of glycolysis. PFKFB3 catalyzes the production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-
BP) to allosterically activate phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), the committed rate limiting step for anaerobic
glycolysis. PFKFB3 is a bifunctional enzyme with kinase activity and phosphatase activity within the same
peptide chain. In the case of PFKFB3, the kinase activity is ~700 more active than the phosphatase, thus
favoring F-2,6-BP production. PFKFB3 is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue compared to other
tissues. Our published data reveal inhibition of PFKFB3 reduced the expression of GLUT4, a key protein that
regulates glucose homeostasis. Notably, we have also shown that PFKFB3 protein expression is reduced in
adipose tissue of fasting animals and rapidly increased after refeeding. In preliminary data, we now show that
PFKFB3 expression is significantly down-regulated in aging adipose tissue. These observations led us to
hypothesize that PFKFB3-dependent regulation of glycolysis plays key roles in regulating adipocyte
metabolism over the life-span, leading to increased age-dependent risk of metabolic disease. We will
begin exploring this hypothesis with two specific aims: 1) To determine the role of age-related changes in
PFKFB3 expression on F-2,6-BP production in fed and fasted adipose tissue through the lifespan; 2) To
determine the role of PFKFB3 in regulation of adipocyte function. The data obtained from this small R03 grant
mechanism will provide a useful model and important functional data to further test the hypothesis that aged
adipose tissue plays a role in age-dependent risk for metabolic diseases."

The overall objective of this proposal is to define the relationship between poor sleep, glymphatic
impairment, and neurocognitive function in adolescents. Insufficient sleep in adolescents is a severe
health risk worldwide. In addition, poor sleep is associated with deficits in motor function, attention, memory,
and impulse control, impacting adolescents in essential areas such as driving and academic functioning.
Several studies have linked poor sleep with impaired neurocognitive function in adolescents. However, the
biological mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. One of those mechanisms may
involve the glymphatic pathway, a network of perivascular spaces that support cerebral waste clearance.
During wakefulness, the brain generates considerable amounts of waste, cleared at least in part via the
glymphatic pathway during sleep. This waste removal is essential for the brain to function appropriately. In this
proposal, we hypothesize that poor sleep leads to glymphatic dysfunction, waste accumulation, and
neurocognitive dysfunction in adolescents. Recently, the number of perivascular spaces (PVS) visible on
brain MRI has been proposed as a noninvasive marker of glymphatic function. Our preliminary data show
increased PVS numbers in patients with poor sleep. Moreover, in a study of US Army Veterans, we have
observed an association between PVS number and neurocognitive function, specifically motor performance.
These initial findings suggest a role of the glymphatic pathway in the association between poor sleep and
neurocognitive function.
To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) Define the association between self-reported and
objective measures of sleep duration and quality on PVS burden in normal adolescents over time after
adjusting for other covariates; and 2) determine the mediating effect of PVS burden in the relationship between
sleep duration and quality, and neurocognitive function in adolescents. To achieve our aims, we will take
advantage of novel technology developed by our group that will allow us to measure PVS in a large,
longitudinal cohort of healthy adolescents and young adults. We expect to observe a direct correlation between
sleep duration and PVS burden. We also expect PVS burden, indicating glymphatic dysfunction, to mediate the
relation between sleep and neurocognitive function.
Findings from this study will be foundational for improving our scientific knowledge of the link between poor
sleep, glymphatic dysfunction, and neurocognitive outcomes in adolescents. Advancing clinical care and
research for sleep in adolescents is in line with the 2021 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Sleep
Disorders Research Plan to ""elucidate the sleep and circadian mechanisms underlying health and disease""
and ""develop tools and/or methods for the early prediction, and detection […] of sleep deficiency and sleep and
circadian disorders in children and adolescents to promote lifelong health and wellbeing and prevent disease."""
10796806,"ABSTRACT: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss globally. Nearly 52.7 million people will
be affected in 2020, and that number will grow to ~79.8 million by 2040. The prevalence varies by ethnicity,
and the rates of undiagnosed primary open angle glaucoma are alarmingly high (50-85%) in white, black and
Latino patients. The challenge in glaucoma detection lies in the asymptomatic nature of its early stage:
damage to the optic nerve occurs in an unnoticeable manner that slowly deteriorates the peripheral vision. By
the time many patients seek evaluation, the disease has reached a late stage and it is a challenge to preserve
the limited remaining central vision. Importantly, early treatment to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP), the
only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, can reduce the rate of progression by 50%, but large population-
based studies have confirmed that screening based on IOP is clinically ineffective.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is central technology for glaucoma screening in standard ophthalmology
services. However, the cost and size of clinical OCT systems limits access to the technology by underserved
populations, who are simultaneously more likely to be affected with glaucoma-inducing conditions (e.g.,
diabetes) and less likely to have access to adequate eye care, vision insurance and ability to travel for
additional appointments. The availability of low-cost, portable and user-friendly technologies that are
deployable in non-specialist outpatient settings (e.g., primary care clinics, endocrinology offices)
where high-risk patients present most often is a critical barrier to widespread implementation of
effective glaucoma screening programs.
We propose a new paradigm for OCT imaging – smartOCT – that leverages the small form factor and ubiquity
of smartphones (SPs) to yield a low-cost, lightweight, small-footprint device that facilitates capture, processing,
visualization and interpretation of OCT data in outpatient services. Our innovative strategy targets
comprehensive integration of OCT with the built-in sensors of smartphones to lower the critical barriers to
mass deployment of OCT in clinics. We will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology and clinical workflow
through the following specific aims: Aim 1) Finalize a smartOCT prototype for low-cost optic nerve imaging.
Aim 2) Confirm the repeatability of smartOCT and comparison to conventional OCT in a pilot clinical study (n =
60). Aim 3) Evaluate the preliminary effectiveness for outpatient services in a pilot study (n = 40) with primary
care. If successful, our work will suggest a clear path to broaden access to the OCT technology needed to
detect glaucoma and to inspire equip new paradigms and contexts for effective glaucoma screening (e.g.,
clinics, health fairs, telemedicine). Successful implementation of smartOCT technology will also blaze a trail for
the OCT research community to consider new form factors and new scanning mechanisms that can be
implicated to study other clinical diseases and/or used in other resource-limited contexts (e.g., global health)."
10795850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite advances in the medical care of sickle cell disease (SCD), most patients continue to experience severe
pain, poor quality of life, progressive organ deterioration and premature death. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure SCD but is associated with numerous toxicities and only 20% of patients
have Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched donors. Therefore, improved and more widely accessible
curative therapies are needed. Genetic modification of autologous HSCs is a promising experimental approach
for treating SCD that circumvents some of the problems associated with allogeneic HSCT, although the optimal
technical strategies are not yet established. This proposal explores the use of adenosine base editors (ABEs)
and prime editors (PEs) for genetic correction of SCD. In contrast to conventional genome editing, these novel
approaches create precise nucleotide alterations independent of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), which
can cause structural DNA abnormalities, cell death or malignant transformation. Adenosine base editors convert
targeted A·T base pairs to G·C pairs. Prime editors copy edited sequence information from a guide RNA template
into a targeted DNA locus. We will test these potentially transformative tools in 3 different strategies for SCD
therapy. Aim 1 employs ABEs to create HSC alterations that recapitulate hereditary persistence of fetal
hemoglobin (HPFH), a benign genetic condition that alleviates the pathophysiology of co-inherited SCD by
inducing the expression of red blood cell (RBC) fetal hemoglobin (HbF), a potent anti-sickling agent. We have
used protein evolution strategies to create new high-efficiency ABEs that generate HPFH mutations at
frequencies of up to 60% in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with HbF being induced
to levels that inhibit hypoxic sickling of erythroid progeny. Aim 2 uses ABEs to convert the mutant SCD codon
from valine to alanine, thereby generating “Hemoglobin Makassar (HbG)”, a naturally occurring benign non-
sickling variant. We have developed an altered PAM-specific ABE that converts HbS alleles to HbG in SCD
donor HSPCs at frequencies of up to 80%, with inhibition of RBC sickling. Aim 3 employs prime editing to revert
the mutant SCD codon to normal (Val→Glu), which we have shown to occur efficiently in the HEK293T cell line
and now aim to optimize in HSPCs from affected individuals. Overall, our preliminary studies have shown proof
of principle for three novel, independent editing approaches to treating SCD without the need to enrich for edited
cells or to create DSBs. Through the proposed research, we seek to optimize the efficiency of these approaches
in primary HSPCs and to further determine their safety and efficacy by using mouse models, in vitro culture
methods and biochemical assays. Developing three approaches simultaneously will enable us to compare their
outcomes directly and to determine the best therapeutic strategy to pursue in future clinical studies. More
generally, our planned studies have the potential to generate new paradigms for using base editors and PEs to
treat numerous genetic blood disorders via precise genetic manipulation of HSCs."
10793601,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had sweeping effects on pregnant women and their
partners. The need to adhere to social distancing guidelines has altered the social
connectedness of expectant parents, with effects on stress, loneliness, reduced access to in-
person prenatal care, and childbirth support. Social support during pregnancy is known to
buffer stress and predict better postpartum outcomes for both new parents and their infants.
For example, greater prenatal support has been linked with decreased risk of parental
postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, lower incidence of preterm birth and low birth
weight, calmer infant temperament, and healthier infant development. Given this evidence,
pandemic-induced changes to social connectedness during pregnancy may have long-term
effects for new parents and their children.
 The current proposal leverages the unique natural experiment of the COVID-19
pandemic to examine the maternal and infant health effects of social connectedness among
pregnant women and their partners. The CHIRP (Coronavirus, Health, Isolation and
Resilience in Pregnancy) study launched in spring 2020 and has enrolled 710 expectant
parents who reported on their feelings of social connectedness and support during
pregnancy. We will follow up with this cohort three, six, and 12 months after the birth of their
child. In addition to collecting self-report data, we will gather hospital birth charts to measure
gestational outcomes, and hair cortisol to measure neuroendocrine stress exposure. We also
plan to use geocoding to model the social, economic, and health impacts of the pandemic
and explore how these impacts shape postpartum outcomes. Our lab has already collected
data from another cohort of 200 expectant parents recruited during pregnancy and followed
over the transition to parenthood, constituting a pre-pandemic comparison sample with the
same measures and timing. We will also conduct a five-year follow-up with children from our
pre-pandemic dataset that will incorporate behavioral and neuroimaging measures of
neurodevelopment.
 Our pilot data indicates significantly higher ratings of psychological distress and lower
ratings of social support among expectant parents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We
expect that this project will make important contributions to the study of stress and resilience
during pregnancy and its long-term effects on both maternal and infant well-being."
10752705,"Project Summary
Tumor immune suppression represents a major obstacle in achieving effective cancer
immunotherapy. The goal of this exploratory project is to develop a novel mRNA-lipid
nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP)-based immunotherapy to overcome this challenge in pancreatic
cancer, one of the deadliest malignancies. Currently, few effective treatments are available for
pancreatic cancer. The majority of pancreatic cancers are also resistant to immune checkpoint
blockade. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to target this lethal cancer. Most
pancreatic cancers display a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).
Tumor-infiltrating effector CD8+ T cells are critical for improved patient survival, and yet they are
either absent or sparse in the majority of pancreatic cancers, indicating an intrinsic mechanism
that impedes T cell infiltration and activation. We recently discovered that Stimulator of
Interferon Genes (STING) is silenced in pancreatic and other cancers. Because STING function
is critical for stimulating antitumor T cell responses, our finding suggests that STING silencing
contributes to the immunologically “cold” TME. We found that reactivating STING upregulates
cytokines/chemokines that are crucial for promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. More
importantly, reactivation of STING specifically kills STING-silenced cancer cells. Because tumor
antigens released by dying cancer cells in vivo could be engulfed by antigen-presenting cells to
generate systemic antitumor response and amplify tumoricidal effect, we hypothesize that
targeted reactivation of STING in pancreatic cancer could invigorate the immune-dampened
TME and improve tumor immunogenicity. In this project, we will develop mRNA-LNP to
specifically deliver permanently active STING mutants into pancreatic cancer to bolster T cell
antitumor cytotoxicity. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional STING
agonists, which lack tumor specificity and do not work in STING-silenced cancers. To define
their efficacy in stimulating antitumor immunity, the STING mRNA-LNP will be tested in vitro and
in an orthotopic syngeneic murine pancreatic cancer model, which faithfully recapitulates the
immunobiologically “cold” TME of pancreatic cancer. We will also combine STING mRNA-LNP
with PD-1 blockade to circumvent pancreatic cancer resistance to the immune checkpoint
therapy and spur synergistic antitumoral activity. These preclinical studies have the potential for
developing a novel immunotherapy to overcome immune resistance and improve treatments for
a diverse array of STING-silenced cancers that are refractory to current therapies."
10762951,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive single-gene disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation, termed ∆F508, occurs in
~85% of CF patients. Because the CFTR gene encodes for an anion transport protein, CFTR mutations alter
electrolyte and water transport, resulting in dense, pathologic, mucous and other secretions. The most
harmful effects of CFTR dysfunction occur in the respiratory system, with recurrent infections and
inflammation of the upper and lower airways. Despite substantial progress with medical therapies, there
remains a tremendous unmet need for improved, durable therapies for CF.
For the past 3 years, our collaborative group of complementary scientists and physicians has determined to
develop a novel, stem cell-based treatment strategy for patients suffering from CF. For several critical
reasons, we directed our efforts to cell-based therapy of CF upper airway disease using ex vivo-expanded,
primary human airway basal stem cells, termed ABCs. The first major milestone was to utilize CRISPR/Cas9
genome editing technology to efficiently correct the ∆F508 mutation in ABCs cultured from CF patients
undergoing sinus surgery. This gene correction approach has led to significant restoration of chloride anion
transport from 0-3% to 30-40% in ABCs. This encouraging, and newly published, development now provides
a pre-clinical roadmap for re-introducing CFTR gene-corrected ABCs into in vivo contexts as a stem cell
replacement therapy.
In this proposal, we will rigorously determine the most efficient, biomaterial platform for ex vivo-to-in vivo
transplant and engraftment of human ABCs, and assess the behavior of gene-corrected ABCs in the lab and
live animal model using a microsurgical model system of upper airway transplantation that we have
developed. The experiments outlined are essential pre-clinical steps in order to translate this approach to CF

At the founding of population genetics in the early 20th century, S. Wright and R.A. Fisher
developed much of the mathematical and conceptual framework underlying the study of
population-level processes dictating variation observed within- and between-species. However,
as evidenced by decades of published interactions, they held strongly differing views regarding
the relative importance of adaptive vs. non-adaptive processes in driving evolution. As pointed
out by J. Crow (2008), these issues were not really resolved, but ""rather they were abandoned
in favor of more tractable studies."" With the proposal of the Neutral Theory by M. Kimura and T.
Ohta, the relative contribution of stochastic effects, as earlier advocated by S. Wright, received
renewed attention. In the following decades, further theoretical development as well as the
availability of large-scale sequencing data have indeed overwhelmingly justified the important
role of genetic drift. However, subsequent research related to linked, rather than direct, selection
effects have re-ignited previous debates. Namely, whether the large class of strongly and
weakly deleterious variants hypothesized under the Neutral Theory, and their related linked
selection effects (i.e., background selection), are sufficient to explain genome wide patterns of
variation; or whether a more predominant class of beneficial variants, and their related linked
selection effects (i.e., selective sweeps), are required. The primary difficulty in answering this
question stems from our lack of an appropriate neutral null model - that is, a model incorporating
genetic drift as modulated by a realistic demographic history, as well as a realistic distribution of
fitness effects summarizing the pervasive effects of both direct and linked purifying selection.
Without this null model incorporating these evolutionary processes that are certain to be
occurring, it is simply not feasible to quantify the periodic frequency with which adaptive
processes are additionally acting to shape patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Future
work will focus on the necessary theoretical and statistical developments for application to
organisms characterized by small progeny distributions within the context of the Wright-Fisher
model and Kingman coalescent (e.g., humans), as well as large progeny distributions within the
context of the Moran model and multiple-merger coalescent (e.g., viruses). In total, the product
of this research will be a framework for inferring evolutionarily appropriate null models
applicable widely across the tree of life, that will enable the field to directly address this long-
standing and fundamental debate, and to accurately identify genomic targets of adaptation."
10772025,"Project Summary / Abstract – Overall
Metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes and their complications are among the most pressing health
issues worldwide accounting for a substantial national burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The
University of Michigan Health System (now Michigan Medicine) has strategically invested in both human and
physical resources over the past 20 years in a concerted attack on these problems. A key component of this
strategy is to foster the development of core laboratories providing expertise and specialized services at
accessible cost to researchers throughout the institution. The University of Michigan is also a member of the
national consortium established in 2016 by the NIDDK for in-depth phenotyping tests of mouse models of
obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic conditions, the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (MMPC). The
Michigan Metabolic Phenotyping in Live Models of Obesity and Diabetes (MPMOD) will build upon our
stablished expertise to provide a unique pallet of standardized, high quality and state-of-the-art in vivo
phenotyping services for researchers nationwide with focus on underrepresented PIs and small laboratories or
institutions that have not received significant federal research funding. The MPMOD at Michigan will be
organized in three distinct cores: The Administrative Core, the Animal Care and Germ-Free Mouse Core, and
the Metabolic, Physiological and Behavioral (MPB) Phenotyping Core. The Administrative Core will provide
overall scientific and fiscal leadership. It will coordinate phenotyping activities among the individual cores and
will foster interaction with phenotyping centers members of the MPMOD Consortium and the Coordinating Unit
(CU). The Animal Care and Germ-Free Mouse Core will be responsible for transportation, housing, and
veterinary care of animals to be assessed at the MPB Phenotyping Core. The MPB Phenotyping Core will
provide a comprehensive battery of in vivo assessments encompassing those provided by the former MMPC,
i.e., glucose or lipid homeostasis (glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, lipid tolerance, hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamps with tracers), whole-animal energy homeostasis (indirect calorimetry by CLAMS, SABLE,
with dietary and environmental temperature challenges), ultradian hormone secretion (Culex platform for serial
biological fluid sampling from free-moving mice without human presence), behavioral measurements (e.g.,
hedonic and homeostatic feeding responses, and obesity- and/or diabetes-associated changes in learning,
anxiety and depression), etc. Additional in vivo services using highly specialized surgical procedures (e.g.,
chronic portal vein cannulation, parabiosis, and stereotaxic brain surgeries), optogenetic and fiber photometry
technologies. Together, the Michigan MPMOD will provide access to a broad range of advanced in vivo
phenotyping services, consultation and training taking advantage of our well-stablished metabolic phenotyping
facilities and unique expertise on hypothalamic function, mouse genetics and specialized surgeries in
experimental animals."
10772026,"Abstract/Summary – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core will be responsible for the overall leadership and scientific oversight of the Michigan
Metabolic Phenotyping of live Models of Obesity and Diabetes (Mi-MPMOD) Center. The Core will provide
administrative assistance to the Animal Care and Germ-Free Core and the Metabolic, Physiological and
Behavioral (MPB) Phenotyping Core and ensure that their services are delivered efficiently and to the highest
possible standards. The leadership team has extensive administrative experience and is centrally located in
the North Campus Research Complex at the Elizabeth W. Caswell Diabetes Institute (CDI), adjacent to
administrative cores of the Michigan Diabetes Research Center (MDRC), the Michigan Nutrition and Obesity
Research Center (MNORC) and the CDI. This clustering of related Administrative Cores facilitates an efficient
use of space and equipment and leverages the collective experience of all centers’ administrators assuring the
transfer of best practices among them. The administrative core will: a) Coordinate the receipt of animals and
assignments for the appropriate phenotyping services; b) monitor studies progress until completion of data
analysis and submission of final reports to the requesting investigator(s); c) ensure secure processing and
signing of all necessary conditions of use statements, contracts, service fees, and data records as well as the
subsequent data submission to the MPMOD Consortium and Coordinating Unit (CU) database; d) manage
budgetary and workflow records, oversee cost recovery, program income and adjustment of service charges;
e) re-budget Center funds based on the cores service activity and scientific needs; f) promote the availability of
MPMOD resources to local investigators, regional partners, and nationwide research institutions, including
academic and for-profit biotechnology and pharma companies; g) develop communication strategies to
specifically target underrepresented PIs and small laboratories or institutions that have not received significant
federal research funding through advertisement, seminars, and direct contact with the academic departments;
h) facilitate the development of new research technology and training resources for the Center’s MPB
Phenotyping Core; and i) meet regularly with the Advisory committees and oversee the preparation and
submission of annual progress report to NIDDK. The Administrative Core will work closely with the Centers’
Consortium and the national CU by actively participating in the solicitation and review of applications for the
MPMOD Consortium’s funding programs. It will also work in synergy with the Consortium and CU to minimize
overlap of services and establish, standardize, document, and distribute phenotyping protocols and quality
control procedures to laboratories nationwide."

The Animal Care and Germ-Free Mouse Core of the Michigan MPMOD will play a central role in the
management of animal flow through the Center’s MPB Phenotyping Core from initial acquisition to final
disposition of imported mice. Both the Core Director and Associate Director are veterinarians and diplomates
of the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine. Specific functions of the Animal Care and Germ-Free
Mouse Core include the coordination of mouse importation, quarantine, and environmental testing for a panel
of murine pathogens, as well as providing housing, husbandry, and veterinary care of mice in accordance with
the MPMOD (Administrative Core) guidelines. Research services such as hands-on technical support and
germ-free technology and expertise will be unique components of our Core. Germ-free C57BL/6J,
C57BL/6NCrl, BALB/c, and Swiss-Webster mice as well as several genetically engineered strains will be
available to MPMOD investigators. In addition, investigators may import germ-free mice from other institutions
or request rederivation of new germ-free strains. Experimental manipulations available for germ-free and SPF
mice include routine treatments, sample collections, and in-house analysis (blood, feces, urine, etc.), training,
and experimental design consultation, among others. Goals of the Animal Care and Germ-Free Mouse Core
are to provide the highest level of health and well-being as well as veterinary expertise for all research animals
in our USDA-certified and AAALAC-accredited facilities. All Core services will be performed under University of
Michigan IACUC approved protocols. All SPF mice will be housed in Allentown ventilated racks. Germ-free or
gnotobiotic mice will be maintained in flexible-film isolators or Tecniplast Isocage racks. Barrier conditions
including cage changing in vertical laminar flow changing stations, strict adherence to microisolator techniques,
and use of isolated rooms for colony segregation will assure maintenance of pathogen-free animals. The
Animal Core will also provide oversight for technical support such as dose administration, obtaining body
weights, fasting, glucose levels, providing and monitoring special diets, and transfer of mice to and from ULAM

10772034,"Project Summary / Abstract – Core C. Metabolic, Physiological and Behavioral Phenotyping Core
The purpose and primary goals of the Metabolic, Physiological and Behavioral (MPB) Phenotyping Core are to
provide expert consultation, state-of-the art equipment, and technical services that are critical for the detailed in
vivo metabolic and behavioral phenotyping of mouse models of obesity, diabetes, and associated disorders. A
thorough understanding of the physiological responses to nutrients and environmental factors and of the
pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to diabetes and related metabolic diseases is required if we are
to effectively combat these conditions. However, the resources and technology necessary to phenotypically
probe whole animal models of altered glucose homeostasis and metabolism at a level that reveals basic
underlying mechanisms of control are not available in most investigators’ laboratories. The MPB Core meets
these needs through a comprehensive, convenient, and cost-effective menu of platforms that includes: 1)
Glucose homeostasis and metabolic clamps (the Core performs hyperinsulinemic clamp studies including
specialized analysis of metabolite storage and release in mice), 2) Whole animal metabolic assessment: The
CLAMS and Promethion indirect calorimetry systems are used to examine metabolic rate, respiratory
exchange ratio, food consumption, and locomotor activity in conventional mice or their germ-free counterparts,
3) In vivo lipid metabolism using 3H-labeled triglyceride, fatty acid, or glycerol for assessment of the tissue lipid
incorporation and disposal or lipolysis. 4) In vivo steady-state stable isotope labeling of metabolites (the core
performs bolus-continuous intravenous infusion to establish a steady-state of any given metabolite and
provides samples to an independent Metabolomics Core at the university for further analyses of metabolic
tracing or fluxes in tissues), 5) Automated blood/body fluids sampling and infusion utilizing a Culex/Empis
platform to remotely collect serial samples and infuse substances to freely behaving, unstressed mice, 6)
Mouse models of parabiosis, bariatric surgery, or germ-free mice. These models are provided by the Core and
subsequent phenotyping can be performed with the combined resources of all the Cores in the Michigan
MPMOD, 7) Exercise training and testing of running capacity including VO2max. 8) Basic behavioral tests to
determine general locomotor activity, anxiety, exploration habits, or spatial learning in mouse models of
metabolic dysfunction. 9) Ingestive behavior: Meal microstructure and reinforcing properties of dietary
constituents are measured in either home-cage or operant-conditioning paradigms. 10) in vivo fiber photometry
and optogenetic stimulation to monitor and manipulate activity in specific neuronal populations to assess their
role in metabolism and behavior. The MPB Core also provides consultation and advice on experimental
design, reliable data from a range of validated assays, essential data analysis relevant to the needs of multiple
investigators and training opportunities in the established methodologies of the Core to researchers both at the
University of Michigan and throughout the country."
10757640,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and
most patients have poor outcomes, with a five-year survival rate that is less than 40%. The majority of deaths
are attributable to metastasis and treatment failure, and unfortunately, our understanding of these pathways is
incomplete. Consequently, there are no targeted therapies against these biologic processes. Recently, we
performed a single cell analysis of HNSCC tumors that revealed a new transcriptional pathway – dubbed a hybrid
epithelial/mesenchymal state (HEM) – as a critical driver of invasion and metastasis. This pathway is clearly
distinct from the classical EMT pathway, as most key EMT transcription factors (TFs) were not expressed, with
the exception of Snail2. The importance of this pathway to disease etiology was highlighted by the fact that the
presence of the HEM signature in tumors was more predictive of treatment outcome than any other commonly
used pathologic or demographic factor.
The main driver of HEM appears to be the Snail2 transcription factor, but little is known about how Snail2
orchestrates HEM. We propose to determine the direct and indirect targets of Snail2 and assess their roles in
promoting invasion and metastasis. This will reveal the proteins in the HEM pathway that promote tumor
progression and thus represent targets for the rational design of therapeutics. Because HNSCC tumors are
highly heterogeneous, we expect that bulk genomic approaches may not capture Snail2 targets that are activated
or repressed in small subpopulations of tumor cells; yet such targets may still be highly relevant to the etiology
of HNSCC progression. Therefore, we will also use a transposon-based technology known as “calling cards” that
has single-cell resolution to make a comprehensive map of the transcriptional targets of Snail2 across distinct
hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell states (Aim 1). Completion of this aim will identify the key functional targets
of Snail2 and the knockdown, overexpression, and phenotyping assays that we propose will directly determine
if the inhibition (or activation) of these targets blocks the effect of Snail2 on invasion and metastasis. To
complement this approach, in Aim 2, we will investigate whether Snail2 acts cooperatively with other TFs and
then learn the functional consequences of such cooperativity. This is important because while it has proven
difficult to find small molecules that inhibit TF-DNA interactions, targeting cooperative interactions between TFs
is emerging as a viable strategy for targeting oncogenic TFs. Furthermore, while these TFs cooperate with Snail2
at some loci, they likely activate other HEM genes independently or by interacting with one another, so identifying
their targets will increase our knowledge of this pathway and expand the list of druggable HEM targets.
Completion of these aims will provide a detailed map of a new pathway that plays a critical role in HNSCC
metastasis and invasion and will identify opportunities for rational drug design and targeted therapeutics against
HNSCC."
10772094,"ABSTRACT
This project aims to optimize a critical but understudied ingredient of language intervention provided to children
with developmental language disorder (DLD) – feedback. The project is designed to bridge the gap between
previous findings in our lab of inefficient feedback processing in DLD and clinical practice by identifying the
conditions under which feedback-based learning can be improved in DLD. We hypothesize that the
effectiveness of feedback can be significantly enhanced for children with DLD when it is tailored to their unique
learning strengths. The rationale for this project is based on evidence that learning can be improved by
enhancing the dominance of an intact learning system through feedback. The project will achieve its aim by
manipulating (1) the timing of the feedback (immediate vs. delayed) and (2) the level of the learner’s
involvement in error correction dictated by feedback (active vs. passive correction) to modulate the dominance
of the implicit and declarative learning systems. While immediate feedback is processed by the implicit learning
system, delaying the feedback by a few seconds implicates the declarative system. Likewise, teaching
approaches that prompt active self-correction are associated with declarative learning, while passive exposure
to corrective feedback (e.g., corrective recast) is assumed to support implicit learning. Aim 1 will determine
the effect of manipulating feedback timing on declarative and implicit learning in 140 school-age children (8-12
years) with DLD. Evidence that delaying feedback improves learning in DLD would support the hypothesis of
the implicit deficit theory that intervention should capitalize on declarative learning mechanisms. The project
will test a novel alternative feedback-learning parity hypothesis whereby feedback-based learning is optimized
when the timing of the feedback is aligned with the dominant learning system at a given time (i.e., immediate
feedback during implicit learning; delayed feedback during declarative learning). Within the same group of
children, Aim 2 will compare feedback-based learning in children with DLD when feedback (a) prompts active
self-correction or (b) passively exposes learners to error corrections. Children will engage in two nonword-
object paired-associate learning tasks. In one task feedback will promote active self-correction, which is in line
with declarative learning. In the other task, feedback will passively expose the learner to corrective feedback
and lead to learning that is assumed to be implicit. The project will determine whether children with DLD learn
better when feedback prompts self-correction or when they are exposed to passive corrections. For both aims,
behavioral indicators of response to feedback will be complemented by electrophysiological measures of
feedback processing that can determine the involvement of implicit and declarative brain systems during the
learning process. This work is scientifically and clinically significant because elucidating what manipulations
optimize feedback-based learning will enhance our understanding of the impaired learning mechanism in DLD
and will provide clinical guidance on what type of feedback to use during an intervention."
10862614,"Despite significant advances over several decades, very few Tissue Engineered Medical Products (TEMPs) have
been clinically or commercially successful, as a significant technology gap, known as the “Valley of Death”, has
prevented their scalable, consistent and cost-effective manufacture. This proposal is for the competing renewal
of the current “Case Center for Multimodal Evaluation of Engineered Cartilage.” There is a growing need for
TEMPs in multiple applications. We therefore believe that now is the time for a bold shift from our original focus
on cartilage-centric evaluation technologies to developing, demonstrating, and deploying novel technologies to
enable Quality-by-Design manufacturing of a variety of structural tissues, and to, thus, bridge the Valley of Death.
The goal of the Center is the adoption of our technologies by the TEMP community at large. Consequently, the
Center, will be renamed “Center for Modular Manufacturing of Structural Tissues” (CM2OST), and will apply
knowledge and technology developed during the first 5 years to manufacturing-oriented challenges. The Center
will be a consortium between CWRU and the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI), and will
focus on technologies that enable scalable, modular, automated, closed (SMAC) manufacturing. The Specific
Aims of the proposal are to 1) Assist our CPs and SPs by pushing the technologies developed at the Center
out to them. 2) Develop a cohesive set of innovative technologies, methods, and protocols that enable
structural tissue manufacturing through 4 TR&D projects, described below, and 3) Develop a new, state-of-the-
art, training and dissemination program. Strategically, we will break the overall R&D program into 4 TR&Ds
representing key components of the TEMP assembly-line model. TR&D-1 covers dynamic control of cell pheno-
type and function during the manufacturing process, and development of tissue-specific sensors for dynamic
non-invasive monitoring of cell phenotype and function. TR&D-2 will develop sensor-enabled scaffolds and novel
optode-based optical sensors to automate cell seeding and to monitor metabolites and provide feedback on local
and bulk medium conditions. TR&D-3 will develop bio-instructive bioreactors with integrated actuators and sen-
sors for feedback control, and will physically integrate them with the Tissue Foundry, an ARMI prototype auto-
mated TEMP assembly line. TR&D-4 will integrate sensors and actuators with the automation and data man-
agement system of the Tissue Foundry and will perform a manufacturing demonstration run. Demonstrating
technologies developed in the TR&Ds will provide insights into TEMP development, process development and
automation, and expose unanticipated technology gaps. Each TR&D represents a step in the TEMP assembly-
line model, thus, though the technologies are developed independently, each TR&D feeds into the next. TR&Ds,
Collaborative and Service Projects synergize, integrating and exploiting each other’s technologies as they come
online. CM2OST will be a national resource for collaborations and a platform for developing, testing, validating,
and disseminating new technology, methods, and protocols for TEMP manufacturing."

10903720,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extensive work has implicated human resistin (Hresistin) and its rodent correlate resistin-like molecule (RELM)-
α in inflammatory mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Elevated levels of Hresistin in the lungs of
idiopathic PAH and Scleroderma PH patients1,2 correlate with the disease severity of PH and predict mortality.3
Rodent models of PH show RELMα is critical to PH remodeling of the lung vasculature and right heart.3-7 We
reported Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) as a binding partner of RELMα/Hresistin,8 and mediator of chemokine
activities of RELMα/Hresistin in myeloid cells.1,8 We also reported that, Hresistin/RELMα initiates the
inflammatory response to injury at PH onset, through activating damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
pathway high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1).1,4,9 However, it is unclear how Hresistin/RELMα’s diverse
inflammatory effects are integrated or how they amplify and sustain inflammation to induce vascular remodeling
over time.
The NLRP3 inflammasome was recently suggested to be central to the vascular inflammation in PH.10 It mediates
the innate response to injury and is associated with the transition to adaptive immunity. Here, we intend to
demonstrate the novel concept that Hresistin/RELMα is a critical regulator of the priming and activation stages
of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our preliminary data suggests the hypothesis that Hresistin/RELM ritical
α is c
to both NLRP3 priming (via HMGB1)11 and NLRP3 activation (via BTK) and production of IL-1β and IL-18
(via critical BTK12 phosphorylation of four specific NLRP3 tyrosine residues) in both macrophages and B cells,
leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. It suggests a major and novel role for Hresistin/RELMα in
engaging the NLRP3 inflammasome in the innate immune response to injury and to a sustaining adaptive
immune response in the long-term remodeling associated with PH.
We address this hypothesis in two aims: Aim 1: To dissect and prove the detailed mechanism of how Hresistin
regulates NLRP3 inflammasome in inflammatory cells; Aim 2: To investigate the contribution of Hresistin-
regulated inflammasome to vascular remodeling and PH."
11088452,"Not all DNA damage is toxic, as cells can induce programmed DNA damage to regulate core cell biological processes, such as DNA demethylation. Altered DNA demethylation has been observed in Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD+ADRD), including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and age-related cognitive dysfunction. Yet, the role of active DNA demethylation in AD+ADRD remains unclear. We recently discovered that programmed DNA damage occurs within neuronal enhancers and likely plays key roles in active DNA demethylation and epigenetic remodeling (Wu, W,* Hill, SE,* Nathan, WJ* et al., Nature 2021). Preliminary data suggest that transcription controls sites of programmed DNA damage and that AD+ADRD-linked proteins are involved, including TARDBP/TDP-43. Loss of TDP-43, a pathologic hallmark of FTD, Limbic-Predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE), and dysregulated in many AD cases, decreased programmed DNA damage or repair, while depletion of XRCC1, a DNA repair protein linked to a familial neurodegeneration, increased repair. This suggests that programmed DNA damage is carefully regulated in aging to prevent AD+ADRD and neurodegeneration. In this proposal, I will investigate how programmed DNA damage is regulated and the consequences of dysregulation in AD+ADRD and age-related neurodegeneration. 
The K99 phase research will be performed mainly at the NIH with primary mentor Dr. Ward, whose lab uses mice and iPSC-derived neurons to study neurodegenerative diseases including FTD. To supplement my previous training in iPSC-derived neurons, CRISPR, and live cell-imaging, I will also learn advanced genomics (from co-mentor Dr. Nussenzweig and collaborator Dr. Chen), single-particle PALM imaging (from co-mentor Dr. Lippincott-Schwartz) and in vivo mouse models (from Dr. Ward and collaborator Dr. Petrucelli). This additional training and immersion into the DNA repair field will enable my long-term goal to study how neurons regulate programmed DNA damage, chromatin architecture, and DNA repair in AD+ADRD disease states. For Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will use genomics and live-cell imaging to examine the role of transcription in shaping programmed DNA damage sites. In Aim 2 (R00 phase), I will apply these techniques to examine the consequences of diminished programmed DNA damage or repair upon loss of TDP-43. Through studying the mechanisms underlying repair of programmed DNA damage and the role of TDP-43, we will gain additional insight into AD+ADRD pathogenesis. In Aim 3 (K99/R00), studies will investigate the consequences of increased DNA repair by sequencing enhancers in neurons from aged or XRCC1-deficient mouse brains for induced mutations and then conducting an in vivo CRISPRi mouse screen targeting neuronal enhancers to test their essentiality. This proposal facilitates the development of a unique perspective from which to launch an independent career and expand our understanding of programmed DNA damage and its role in the pathogenesis of AD+ADRD. By discovering novel mechanisms implicated in AD+ADRD pathogenesis, we may uncover new therapeutic targets."
10767920,"Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), also known as glomerular hyperfiltration, is a common observation in
the early stage of diabetes and is considered a key risk factor for the later development of diabetic kidney disease
(DKD). Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes have not been fully
understood, the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) has been implicated. In particular, the “tubular hypothesis” is
now widely recognized. It describes that proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and glucose via the sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is upregulated in the diabetic kidney, thereby reducing the NaCl delivery to the
macula densa, which decreases the TGF activity and increases the single-nephron GFR in an effort to normalize
NaCl excretion (SGLT2-NaCl-TGF pathway). We have recently identified a new and complementing mechanism
that increases GFR in the diabetic kidney: the increased tubular glucose load at the macula densa is sensed
through the apical sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and enhances the neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(NOS1)-derived nitric oxide (NO) generation, which blunts TGF responsiveness and likewise increases the
single-nephron GFR (SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway). SGLT2 inhibition is currently changing the perspectives of
antidiabetic therapy with significant renoprotective effects. The benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in the diabetic kidney
have been proposed to be largely independent of its blood glucose-lowering effect and mainly based on the
central role of this transporter in the “tubular hypothesis” of diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and nephropathy.
In accordance with the “tubular hypothesis”, inhibition of SGLT2 increases the macula densa NaCl delivery and
reduces diabetic hyperfiltration and thereby protects the diabetic kidney. However, inhibition of SGLT2 also
increases glucose delivery to the macula densa, which is expected to decrease the TGF responsiveness through
the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway, and thereby limit both the GFR-lowering effect of SGLT2
inhibition and its protective effects on kidney. Therefore, in the present proposal, we will examine the effects of
SGLT2 inhibition on the tubular glucose load at the macula densa, the macula densa NOS1/NO levels, and TGF
responsiveness in diabetic mice, and then determine the significance of the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1
pathway in the SGLT2 inhibition-induced alterations in TGF and GFR by using mouse models with SGLT1
knockout or macula densa-specific NOS1 knockout; moreover, we will compare the effects of dual
SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition and selective SGLT2 inhibition on TGF activity, GFR and kidney injury in diabetic mice,
and further determine the significance of the TGF mechanism in these effects by using a mouse model that lacks
TGF due to macula densa-specific NKCC2 knockout. Successful completion of this proposal will establish the
opposing role of the macula densa SGLT1-NOS1-TGF pathway in the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition on
diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration and kidney injury, and thus provide supportive and mechanistic evidence for
the use of dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition in the treatment of DKD."
10806239,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Retinal vascular diseases are major causes of vision loss in the United States and around the world. To better
treat these disorders, we need to understand the signaling pathways that control the growth and integrity of
retinal blood vessels. Our recent publications and preliminary data detail a novel angiogenic signaling system
centered around heme, a co-factor critical for oxygen transport, metabolism, and gene transcription. We found
that heme promotes angiogenic growth in the retina by regulating tip/stalk selection, and that reduced heme
production or import leads to reduced retinal vascularization and tissue hypoxia, similar to other retinal
vasculopathies including retinopathy of prematurity, choroidal neovascularization, and the rare but important
exudative vitreoretinopathies. Furthermore, we found that VEGF suppresses, while Norrin-bCatenin promotes,
the expression of the obligate endothelial heme importer, Flvcr2. Based on these data, we hypothesize that
heme, is involved in retinal angiogenesis and retinal vasculopathies. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to
(1) determine how heme intersects with Notch signaling to control angiogenic tip/stalk selection, (2) determine
whether induction of Flvcr2/heme signaling is sufficient and necessary to reverse the vascular defects and
downstream vision changes observed in mouse models of exudative vitreoretinopathy, and (3) characterize the
role for Flvcr2/heme in VEGF-induced angiogenic proliferation and neo-vascularization. To accomplish these
aims, we developed new tools to directly manipulate heme in cultured retinal endothelial cells and assess heme
transport and intracellular trafficking in vitro. We also generated new conditional knock-in and knock-out alleles
to manipulate endothelial heme transport in vivo. Our studies will fundamentally impact our understanding of
how endothelial heme levels are controlled, and the role of heme in retinal angiogenesis and vascular disease."
10765741,"Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are typically thought of as disorders of adolescence and early
adulthood: the peak incidence of new psychotic disorder diagnoses is from 15 to 19 in men and 20 to 24 in
women. However, women also demonstrate a second peak of incidence and vulnerability to the illness in their
40s and early 50s. Theories have been proposed to explain this second peak, including appeals to the
neuroprotective effects of estrogen and other reproductive hormones, which wane in the years preceding
menopause. Despite these observations and theoretical groundwork, very little evidence exists to identify risk
factors for development of psychosis in women experiencing the menopause transition. This is partly because
development of psychosis in this population is relatively rare and is thus difficult to observe. In response to
the NIMH funding opportunity announcement entitled, “Mood and Psychosis Symptoms during the
Menopause Transition”, we propose a two-pronged approach to identify risk factors for development
of psychosis during the menopause transition. In our first aim, we propose to recruit from established local
and national sources 179 individuals who have developed a first episode of psychosis during the menopause
transition and to retrospectively identify elements of medical, reproductive, psychiatric, and family history that
predispose to the development of psychosis when compared to 144 matched controls who developed
depression in the same period. We hypothesize that women who developed psychosis during the menopause
transition will report a prodromal period of attenuated symptoms preceding the development of frank
psychosis, that factors generally predisposing to psychosis onset will be relatively over-represented in the
psychosis cohort, and that psychiatric disorders tied to hormone fluctuations will be elevated in both cohorts
relative to population rates. In our second aim, we propose to leverage our team’s established expertise in
identifying risk factors for psychosis to prospectively study women who have attenuated psychotic symptoms,
elevating their risk for developing psychosis. From established sources, we will identify 196 women who are at
clinical high risk for psychosis during the earliest phases of the menopause transition. We will then follow these
women and 98 matched healthy controls over 2 years, collecting clinical, behavioral, computational,
endocrinological, and (in an exploratory subset) imaging and electrophysiological data as they transition toward
menopause. We hypothesize that baseline psychotic and cognitive symptom severity will predict conversion to
psychosis and that the worsening of these symptoms will correspond to specific clinical and hormonal markers
of the menopause transition. We also hypothesize that candidate psychosis biomarkers will predict conversion
and functional decline and will be impacted by markers of the menopause transition. Together, these studies
will be the first to identify definitive risk factors for psychosis development in aging women. Our goal is to use
the data generated to develop specific interventions to mitigate risk for psychosis in this vulnerable population."

This application is in response to PAR-21-212, Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project Follow-Up Study 2.0
(ADSP FUS 2.0): The Diverse Population Initiative. Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) (e.g. aggression,
psychosis, anxiety, apathy, depression, agitation, sleep disturbances, repetitive behaviors) occur in 85% of AD
patients, and are associated with accelerated decline, out-of-home placement, increased costs, and greatly
increased suffering of patients and families. Despite this, our understanding of the etiology of NPS in AD is
inadequate, with treatments for NPS often being ineffective and associated with serious adverse effects
(including increased mortality). This knowledge gap is particularly egregious in underserved racial and ethnic
groups such as Hispanics and African-Americans, which historically have had limited genetic and phenotypic
studies of AD, although AD is up to twice as prevalent in these ethnic groups compared to non-Hispanic Whites.
To begin addressing this lack of diversity in AD genomics studies, the NIH/NIA has begun a number of diverse
genomics initiatives, among these the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and its Follow-Up-Study
(ADSP-FUS) which have assembled and whole-genome sequenced ~60,000 individuals of diverse ancestral
background (Hispanic, African American, Asian, non-Hispanic White) and are now in the process of harmonizing
cognitive, brain imaging, neuropathological and biomarker data on these individuals. There is, however, no plan
to collect, harmonize, or analyze the important AD-associated NPS data that has been collected for these
samples. This is a critical oversight, as a better understanding of the genetic basis of NPS in AD, informed by
ancestral background, is vital to infer the mechanistic pathways underlying these highly disabling symptoms and
develop more effective pharmacological targets. To begin addressing this gap, we propose to (1) expand the
racially and ethnically diverse datasets of the ADSP-FUS and related efforts to include harmonized NPS data,
creating the largest and most diverse genomic resource on NPS in AD to date (n=61,343) allowing researchers
to assess a wide range of additional critical hypotheses through these resources; (2) utilize these harmonized
data to identify and describe genetic determinants, pathways, and polygenic effects underlying specific NPS in
AD; (3) explore the shared genetic architecture across AD-associated NPS and with primary psychiatric
disorders; and (4) disentangle the role of ancestry in NPS genetic risk."
10772144,"This new application represents a continuation of the California Primate Spinal Cord Research
Consortium project on human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neural stem cell
transplantation; our overarching goal is to understand both basic mechanisms of spinal cord
organization and function in non-human primates, and to leverage these and other advances in
developing translational human pro-regenerative therapies. We have made considerable
progress in the last 5 years and now propose new specific aims that will directly bear on the
potential of human neural stem cells (NSCs) to benefit human SCI.
Aim 1: Examine Mechanisms Underlying Graft-Related Functional Improvement: Graft
Silencing with Inhibitory DREADDs. Work in this aim will establish whether functional
recovery observed in non-human primates after grafts of spinalized neural stem cells is related
to graft activation of host neural circuits. This knowledge will be important for human translation.
Aim 2: Determine Whether 4-AP Improves Anatomical and Functional Outcomes After
Neural Stem Cell Grafts There is a vast literature supporting potentially beneficial effects of
4AP in SCI, and 4AP is approved for human use as a conduction-enhancing drug in multiple
sclerosis. This aim will determine whether treatment with neural stem cell grafts plus 4AP
improves anatomical and functional outcomes.
Aim 3: Determine Whether PTEN/SOCS3 Inhibition Improves Host Corticospinal
Regeneration and Functional Outcomes. Rodent studies indicate that functional benefits of
neural stem cell grafts are mediated by formation of host-to-graft-to-host electrophysiological
relays across sites of SCI. These relays require host axon regeneration into grafts. In humans,
corticospinal axons are essential for voluntary movement. This aim will determine whether
inactivation of PTEN/SOCS3 will enhance corticospinal axon regeneration and improve
functional outcomes in primates."
10738780,"ABSTRACT
 Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver cancer. HBV produces
co-terminal large (L), middle (M), and small (S) envelope proteins containing preS1+preS2+S, preS2+S,
and S domain alone, respectively. Central S domain and N-terminal preS1 domain respectively mediate
virion attachment to HSPG and NTCP, the low- and high-affinity HBV receptors. Corresponding
antibodies can neutralize HBV infectivity, although how anti-preS2 antibodies neutralize HBV infectivity
remains enigmatic. Intriguingly, preventing M protein expression or artificially deleting most part of the
preS2 domain does not impair HBV virion production or viral infectivity in cell culture, and late stage of
chronic HBV infection often selects for point mutation of preS2 ATG codon to abolish M protein
expression, or in-frame deletions to remove N-terminal preS2 domain. Such deletions are much more
prevalent in liver cancer patients than those with mild liver diseases, but the driving force remains unclear.
This R21 exploratory grant application aims to characterize the biological properties of such naturally
occurring and clinically important HBV mutants. We hypothesize that 1) M-minus mutants and preS2
deletion mutants remain infectious; 2) preS2 deletions escape neutralization by anti-preS2 antibodies,
which can work through binding to preS2 domain on either L or M protein; 3) consequently M-minus
mutants partially escape anti-preS2 antibodies. Two specific aims are proposed to critically test our
working hypotheses. Aim 1 will characterize clinically important M-minus and preS2 deletion mutants
and establish their infectivity. The naturally occurring mutations will be introduced to an infectious clone
of genotype C and genotype D, respectively, and viral particles generated from transfected HepG2 cells
will be inoculated to HepG2/NTCP cells and differentiated HepaRG cells to test their infectivity. Aim 2
will determine susceptibility of such M-minus and preS2 deletion mutants to neutralizing antibodies and
establish whether anti-preS2 antibodies work through L, M, or either protein. We will abolish M protein
expression by mutation of preS2 ATG codon and enhance its expression via optimized Kozak sequence.
In addition, viral particles containing neutralization escaping preS2 deletion in L, M, or both proteins will
be generated by co-transfection experiments and their susceptibility to anti-preS2 antibodies determined.
If the proposed studies reveal that anti-preS2 antibodies can neutralize HBV infectivity through M protein,
then an additional host factor might be involved in infection by wild-type HBV. In this regard polymerized
human serum albumin can bind to the preS2 domain on M protein, which was proposed over 30 years
ago as an HBV entry mechanism."
10741828,"Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of Medicare hospitalizations. About 50% of HF patients suffer from
HF with low ejection fraction (HFrEF) for which there are treatments. The other 50% suffer from HFpEF,
(preserved ejection fraction) characterized by the inability of the left ventricle (LV) to accommodate larger filling
volumes upon greater demands in cardiac output. Currently, no treatments are available for HFpEF and studies
demonstrate a female predominance (2:1 vs. men). Noteworthy, the VA has identified as a research priority
Women Veteran’s health. HFpEF pathophysiology is complex and the cause for female predominance is unclear.
However, studies strongly suggest a role for LV fibrosis in the development of HFpEF which, appears
accentuated in post-menopausal women. Thus, there is a need to identify, evaluate and develop novel
treatments in pre- or later stage HFpEF female animal models targeting fibrosis leading to improved LV function.
Cardiac fibrosis is preceded and orchestrated by dysregulated inflammation where macrophages are key.
Systemic inflammation derived from the presence of kidney disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and/or
hypertension leading to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines was identified as a likely key contributor to
HFpEF. Pharmacologic approaches that non-specifically inhibit inflammation so as to attenuate fibrosis, are
poorly tolerated. However, selective and targeted modulation of inflammation has emerged as a concept
whereby the dysregulated process may be physiologically controlled leading to reduced fibrosis. The discovery
of pro-resolution mediators such as lipoxins and resolvins as well as the identification of their receptors such as
the formyl peptide receptor (FPR), has led to new insights towards addressing unresolved inflammation.
Macrophages express FPR that when stimulated, induce their M2 like polarization to a pro-resolution phenotype.
We utilized FPR agonists in rodent models of myocardial infarction where treatment significantly improves LV
function and reduces non-infarcted area fibrosis. However, no studies have assessed their potential use in pre-
clinical female models of HFpEF. We propose that: “Treatment with FPR agonists polarizes macrophages to a
pro-resolution phenotype limiting adverse left ventricular remodeling and fibrosis in animal models mimicking
HFpEF in women, leading to improved chamber function”. Aim 1 will test if the oral administration of an FPR
agonist (compound 43) to a female animal model of early stage HFpEF prevents the development of fibrosis
leading to the preservation of optimal myocardial material properties and thus, improved left ventricular diastolic
and systolic function. Aim 2 if the oral administration of an FPR agonist to a female animal model of HFpEF
compounded by renal injury ameliorates tissue fibrosis leading to the preservation of optimal myocardial material
properties and thus, improved left ventricular diastolic and systolic function. Aim 3 if the oral administration of an
FPR agonist to female animal models of early stage or compounded HFpEF normalizes blood levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and triggers the polarization of macrophages to a pro-resolution phenotype. We will also
perform a broader characterization of the infiltrating leucocyte population as well as macrophage derived
conditioned media treatment of culture cardiac fibroblasts to assess its effects on cell phenotype."
10817889,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Urolithiasis imposes a substantial and growing public health burden in the United States with a prevalence nearly
doubled over the past 15 years, impacting now 1 in 11 Americans in their lifetime. Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL)
remains to be the only non-invasive treatment option for kidney stone patients despite the advances in
ureteroscopy. The progressive decline in the clinic use of SWL, on the other hand, has been attributed to several
key factors, including 1) no fundamental technology breakthrough with problematic dry coupling technique widely
employed by contemporary shock wave lithotripters, 2) no real-time monitoring of cavitation activity during clinical
SWL, and 3) increased number of shockwaves administered per session with elevated fragment size and non-
successful rate. Overall, addressing these critical issues is urgently needed to improve the efficiency and safety
of SWL, and ultimately, reinvigorate the confidence of urologists in this non-invasive treatment modality for stone
patients. In this competing R01 renewal application, we will leverage the knowledge and expertise that our
interdisciplinary team has accumulated in the past ten years through the R37 program. We will focus on
developing the next-generation SWL, cavitation monitoring, and
miniature
wet coupling technologies as well as
strategies to produce fine stone fragments in SWL with clear translational potentials. We propose three specific
aims: 1) create a SAFE (Steerable and Adjustable Focusing Electrohydraulic) shock wave generator with flexible
focal width and beam orientation, and a miniature wet coupling device, 2) develop 3D Dynamic Cavitation
Monitoring (3D-DCM) technology for safeguarding SWL
while improving stone fragmentation efficiency and
treatment outcome
, and 3) investigate mechanism of surface acoustic wave (SAW) generation and its
contribution to producing fine fragments through synergistic interaction with cavitation in SWL. Achieving these
aims will significantly advance the state-of-the-art research activities in SWL, and further propel technology
development in the field in close collaboration with lithotripter manufacturers. The new technologies envisioned
in this project will improve the safety and efficacy of SWL, while providing the urologist opportunity and flexibility
in tailor-designing the treatment protocol for stone patients under various clinical scenarios."
10806201,"ABSTRACT
 In response to inflammatory stimuli, neutrophils (PMN) extrude neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), webs
of negatively-charged cell-free (cf) DNA complexed with positively-charged histones, which ensnare pathogens
but also damage host tissue, contributing to diseases including sepsis, in which a large burden of NETs is
acutely produced causing endothelial damage and organ dysfunction, and sickle cell disease (SCD), in which
there is a chronic increase in NET production that contributes to vascular inflammation and painful vaso-
occlusive episodes (VOE). Unfortunately, interventions that block NET release increase bacterial
dissemination, while treatments that degrade NETs can release entrapped microbes and toxic NET-
degradation products (NDPs) that contribute to multisystem organ damage. I posit that NET stabilization, in
which NETs are preserved but modified to reduce NDP release and enhance bacterial capture, may be
therapeutic in both sepsis and SCD. Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a positively-charged chemokine released by
activated platelets that binds to and cross-aggregates polyanions like heparin and DNA. I have found that PF4
physically compacts NETs, increasing their resistance to nucleases. PF4 also binds to negatively-charged
molecules on the bacterial surface and markedly enhances their capture by NETs. KKO, a human (h)
PF4:heparin complex-binding monoclonal antibody (moAb), stabilizes PF4:NETs, further increasing nuclease
resistance. In murine sepsis models, hPF4 and an Fc-modified, deglycosylated KKO (DG-KKO), work in
concert to decrease NDP release, enhance bacterial capture, and improve outcomes. In this proposal, I will
compare the effect of NET stabilization in sepsis and SCD, to clarify its mechanism of action and assess if it is
protective in both acute and chronic NET release. Specific Aim (SA) #1: Define the mechanism(s) by which
hPF4 and DG-KKO stabilize NETs. I will evaluate how hPF4 and DG-KKO modify NETs, using hPF4 variants,
other cations, and anti-hPF4 moAbs in vitro and in murine sepsis models. SA#2: Define the mechanism(s) of
enhanced NET antimicrobial activity. I will define how PF4:NETs bind different classes of bacteria, assess if
NET stabilization enhances bacterial killing, and test whether other cations can replicate these effects. SA#3:
Determine whether NET stabilization is protective in SCD. I will define whether NET-targeted therapies
protective in SA#1, reduce cellular injury in microfluidic channels infused with plasma from SCD patients and in
a murine model of SCD. I will then measure the association between PF4, NDP levels, and disease severity in
SCD patients. I will pursue these studies within the context of a career development plan that combines
didactic courses, multidisciplinary mentorship, and interdepartmental collaboration. This work will enhance our
understanding of NETs and support a potential novel intervention for two distinct inflammatory disorders. It will
also facilitate my growth as an independent clinician-scientist with a career at an academic pediatric center
focused on the basic research and clinical care of children with prothrombotic/proinflammatory diseases."

A specific subset of T cell lymphoma (TCL) called Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) frequently harbors
chromosomal translocations involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. Chemotherapy is the
current standard of care for ALK+ ALCL, but fails in approximately 30% of patients. Most ALK+ ALCL that fail
chemotherapy respond well to the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as crizotinib, with higher
responses in children than in adults and FDA agency recently granted the breakthrough therapy designation
for crizotinib for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL. Based on these exciting results,
it is not impossible to think that in the future ALK TKIs will become the first-line therapy for ALCL, thus
overcoming the long-term toxicity of chemotherapy. A similar switch has happened in the case of ALK+ non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is currently treated in first-line with ALK TKIs.
Despite most ALK+ ALCL patients refractory to chemotherapy achieve complete remission when treated with
ALK TKIs, still a fraction of patients quickly develop resistance. In addition, responder patients are not
completely cured as discontinuation of crizotinib is associated with rapid lymphoma relapse even after many
years of complete remission with undetectable disease. Therefore, ALCL can develop molecular mechanisms
that protect lymphoma cells from the activity of ALK TKIs. To achieve the ambitious goal of treating ALK+
ALCL with targeted therapy and replace chemotherapy as much as possible, there is need to completely
understand these mechanisms that lead to ALK TKI resistance in ALCL.
By genetic screenings, extensive sequencing and mouse models, we identified three main mechanisms
leading to ALK TKI resistance and possibly sustaining the long-term persistence of ALCL cells: - we identified a
phosphatase-mediated mechanism when we discovered that PTPN1 and PTPN2 are phosphatases of ALK
and together with the SHP2 phosphatase regulate the sensitivity of ALCL cells to ALK TKIs; - we discovered
that activation of PI3Kγ signaling supports survival of persister cells during ALK inhibition; - we elucidated the
key role of the Rho family GTPases to mediate ALK signaling in ALCL. For this project, we hypothesize that
targeting these three main pathways with specific combined therapies could cope with resistance and lead to
the eradication of persister cells for a complete cure of ALK+ ALCL. In this project, we will validate this concept
with in vitro and in vivo models that will be used to test different therapeutic strategies. Thus, ALK+ ALCL could
become the first T cell lymphoma to be completely cured without chemotherapy, with obvious long-term
benefits for children and adults affected by this disease. In addition, our results could pave the way to broaden
these therapeutic concepts to other incurable TCL."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by heterogeneity in sex, race, APOE ε4 status, and tau. APOE ε4
status has been used to stratify AD patients in clinical trials (e.g., the aducanumab trial). Women with AD
have faster cognitive decline compared to men with AD from longitudinal studies. African Americans decline
faster than Whites on memory tests and visuospatial functioning. Furthermore, we know that the changes
in cognitive functions are negatively associated with tau levels. In addition to the heterogeneity, another
challenge facing AD trials is the follow-up time in study designs. In the recent aducanumab trial, the dose of
aducanumab was increased during the course of the study for APOE ε4 positive patients, but their follow-up
times remained unchanged. The proposed project will respond to PAR-19-070: Research on Current Topics in
Alzheimer’s Disease and Its Related Dementias. We will develop adaptive designs to allow the modiﬁcation
of follow-up time for patients with dose change in Aim 1. The published results from the aducanumab trial
will be used in simulation studies to compare the statistical performance of the proposed adaptive designs
with the existing designs without follow-up time change. Our simulation results indicated that our proposed
adaptive designs guarantee the type I error rate and power, while the existing designs do not. In Aim 2,
we will develop new optimal composite scores for each subpopulation by using the baseline data and the
rate of change over time to better understand the differences in cognition and trajectories of decline. We
will develop one optimal composite score for each subpopulation stratiﬁed by sex, race, APOE ε4 status, and
tau, based on data from the ADNI study. We will demonstrate how best to manage statistically the effects
of demographic, genetic, and biomarker factors on cognitive ability of AD patients. The optimal composite
scores are expected to be more sensitive to detect cognition change compared to the measures we traditionally
use. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration released a ﬁnal guidance on developing enrichment strategies
in clinical investigations to promote innovation in drug development. Treatment effect heterogeneity exists
among patients with different characteristics. Identifying subpopulations who are more likely to respond to
a new treatment at a given dose would signiﬁcantly increase the success rate of AD trials and avoid the types
of issues that occurred in the aducanumab trial. Adaptive enrichment designs for AD trials will measure
the treatment effectiveness of each subpopulation at the interim analysis for futility based stopping, and can
save sample sizes compared to the existing designs. We will add a constraint on the probability of ‘wrong’
stopping for futility to avoid stopping the enrollment for a possible effective treatment on a subpopulation.
This project will provide new statistical tools for AD research to efﬁciently identify individuals at risk of AD
and quickly detect disease progression for AD patients with different characteristics."
10791887,"Activation of skeletal muscle fibers, which is a prerequisite for all bodily movements, is initiated by the muscle
fiber action potential (AP). This wave of electrical depolarization spreads along the fiber away from the
neuromuscular junction and radially into the transverse tubules (TTs), causing positively charged membrane
voltage sensor domains (VSDs) in the TT membrane Ca2+ channel (Cav1.1) to trigger Ca2+ release via the
abutting skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) Ca2+ release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic
reticulum membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling TT VSD movements to SR RyR1 release
channel activation are poorly understood, and the roles of the four individual VSDs within each Cav1.1 are not
established. Furthermore, there are no previous studies of VSD movement in response to an AP in any cell
type. Here in Aim 1 we first determine the time course (Q(t)) of total VSD charge movement during the AP
waveform, and compare it to the time course of Ca2+ release (Aim 1) in adult muscle fibers. In Aims 2 and 3
we examine the time course of the individual VSD movements during an AP. We compare the VSD time
courses to the time course of Q(t) and of activation of SR Ca2+ release via RyR1. VSD components that are
obviously slow or less voltage dependent compared to the measured Ca2+ release would not be capable of
activating the RyR1 Ca2+ release channel. We will characterize the VSD components that do occur prior to
and coincident with RyR1 channel opening in response to an AP, and are thus candidates for regulatory
effectors of channel activation. In Aim 2 we track VSD movements using cys residues introduced individually in
Cav1.1 near the extracellular end of each of the S4 transmembrane helices and fluorescently reacted. In Aim
3 we use artificial fluorescent amino acids introduced near the cytoplasmic end or within the transmembrane
S4 segment itself or in the Cav1.1 alpha I-II and II-III cytoplasmic loops considered critical for Cav1.1-RyR1
coupling. In Aim 4 we experimentally determine the effects of charge-eliminating mutations of the VSDs which
cause human diseases (either hypokalemic periodic paralysis or malignant hyperthermia). We use high speed
(<50 µs/line) line-scan confocal imaging of fibers containing fluorescently stained or fluorescent residues near
or in each VSD. We will also use Ca2+ indicators to monitor Ca2+ signals and calculate the underlying Ca2+
release flux from the SR during a single AP in intact voltage clamped fibers. Our studies will elucidate basic
molecular mechanisms regulating Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle and the roles of Cav1.1 voltage sensor
charges that are mutated in hypokalemic periodic paralysis and malignant hyperthermia. This project has
immediate high impact for basic membrane biophysics of muscle and channel activation, for multiple
disciplines and in the long-term the potential to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of problems of
both locomotion and breathing common to a variety of advanced diseased states and aging."
10795928,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human daylight vision is dominated by signaling in the fovea, a specialization unique to diurnal primates which
is responsible for half of the retinal output and hence input to the higher visual centers. Our high-definition central
vision is initiated in the cone photoreceptors which are packed in a dense and exquisite pixel array in the fovea.
This unique arrangement together with the specialized retinal circuitry is key for the highest spatial and chromatic
resolution attributed to our central vision. It is well known that the density and morphology of cone photoreceptors
differ remarkably between foveal and peripheral primate retina, but our knowledge about the physiological and
functional differences remain quite poor. Interestingly, our recent observations in primate retina have revealed
that the time course of cone signals in the fovea is two-fold slower than in the peripheral retina consistent with
the two-fold difference in the temporal sensitivity of our cone-mediated vision to high-frequency flicker. The broad
goal of our project is to determine the full breadth of heterogeneities in cone signaling, “retinotopy of function”,
across a range of visual inputs and functional properties. We will focus on three salient questions across three
aims: 1) What are the differences in key functional properties of signals originating in the primate cone
photoreceptors across the visual field? (2) Is cellular noise generated in cone phototransduction homogenous in
cones across the visual field and what limits does it pose for cone function and perception? (3) Do foveal cones
exhibit differences in function during natural vision compared to cones in rest of the primate retina? We will
answer these questions using electrophysiological recordings of responses from cones in primate retina and
models that describe cone function. The proposed work will provide a detailed insight into primate cone signaling
especially in the fovea. Death of cone photoreceptors is the primary cause for vision loss in retinal diseases that
attack the fovea such as macular degeneration. A therapy option that holds promise for such degenerative
diseases is stem cell derived photoreceptor replacement therapy. Our study will provide the much-needed
baseline information about foveal cone signaling to evaluate cone function in human stem cell derived retina for
designing effective stem cell-based therapies as a way to ultimately cure degenerative retinal diseases such as
macular degeneration and others."
10845286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown great promise in cancer treatment recently.
However, currently only a minority of patients could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy.
Although the molecular mechanisms involved in the differential responses of cancer patients to
immune checkpoint therapy remain unclear, a general consensus is that tumors with high
mutational burden or tumors with inflammatory phenotypes are more likely to respond to immune
checkpoint therapy due to the presence of higher numbers of anti-tumor T-cells. Thus it appears
that the main challenge to improve immune checkpoint therapy is to manipulate the tumor
microenvironment so it changes from a “cold” one with few anti-tumor T cells to a “hot” one with
many anti-tumor T cells. As such methods and agents that can increase the inflammatory
“hotness” of the tumor microenvironment are highly sought after. On the other hand, radiotherapy,
which has been used to treat localized tumors, has been recently shown to activate immune
signaling pathways. Those discoveries raise the tantalizing possibility that the efficacy of
radiotherapy may be enhanced by manipulating the tumor immune microenvironment.
In this project, we will examine the hypothesis that ATM inhibition is an effective approach to
activate the cGAS/STING pathway by down-regulating mitochondria biogenesis to enable ICB therapy
and boosts abscopal effect of radiotherapy.
We will initially conduct experiments to determine if ATM inhibition could significantly enhance
ICB therapy by use of CRISPR-mediated gene knockout of ATM (Aim 1). We will also attempt to
define the downstream molecular mechanisms and factors that are involved ATM inhibition-
mediated enhancement of ICB therapy (Aim 2). In addition, we will evaluate if a small molecule
inhibitor of ATM could enhance ICB therapy and the systemic (i.e. abscopal) effects of
radiotherapy in syngeneic mouse tumor models (Aim 3).
Upon completion of the project, we hope we can gain significant insights into the roles of ATM in
restraining activation of cellular innate immunity. Such understanding may facilitate the rapid
development of novel approaches to enhance ICB therapy and radiotherapy."
10793523,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The striatum, the principle input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is a central mediator of associative learning for
evaluating, motivating, and directing appropriate actions in response to external stimuli. Behavioral studies
have suggested that distinct sub-regions of the striatum make unique contributions to adaptive learning, and
that dysfunction in particular corticostriatal circuits may explain the range of learning and motivational deficits
observed in basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease and addiction. Learning related changes in
striatum neurons are widely believed to be driven by dopamine dependent bi-directional synaptic plasticity in
distinct populations of direct and indirect pathway output neurons. This proposal will investigate how large
scale, cell-type specific neural dynamics across distinct sub-networks of the striatum evolve to evaluate
external cues, select appropriate actions, and invigorate movement over the course of sensori-motor learning.
We will use a new optical approach we have developed to monitor and manipulate signals from two distinct
output pathways of the striatum across a large 3-dimensional volume in head-fixed behaving mice during types
of learning known to depend on different striatal sub-circuits. We will investigate the causal contribution of
distributed dopaminergic signaling to bi-directional learning related changes in striatum output neurons by
measuring and manipulating patterns of region specific dopamine release across the striatum volume during
learning. Finally, we will employ 2-photon calcium imaging to track activity in hundreds of individual striatum
neurons across days and determine how large scale learning related changes in striatum ensembles result
from day to day changes at the single cell and network levels. Results from the proposed studies will provide
new insight into how spatiotemporal changes in cell-type specific striatum output mediate central aspects of
adaptive learning and action selection, and ultimately, how neurological disorders of learning and motivation
might result from regional dysfunctions in distinct striatum networks."
10808207,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) does not respond to some of the most effective therapies available for
breast cancer treatment. Even aggressive surgery, i.e. mastectomy, does not improve outcome. In fact, patients
receiving breast conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation therapy exhibit better breast cancer specific and overall
survival than patients that undergo a mastectomy, for both metastatic and non-metastatic disease. This is
thought to be due to the radiation-induced abscopal effect. Therefore, we hypothesize that and adjuvant
treatment that can both improve local regional control during BCS and enhance the abscopal effect could improve
the current standard of care. One such option is photodynamic therapy (PDT). We will utilize mesothelin-targeted
photosensitizers (PS). We have previously found that mesothelin is strongly expressed in the majority of TNBCs
and expression is highly associated with both overall and disease-specific survival.
Since most PS are lipophilic, they are often encapsulated within nanoparticles to improve their solubility and to
facilitate systemic delivery. Nanoparticles can be designed to carry high PS payloads, extend the PS circulation
time, improve tumor accumulation, and reduce off-target phototoxicity by minimizing PS uptake in healthy tissue.
However, in order to maximize the benefit of nanoparticles, new nanoformulations must be developed that
minimize the self-quenching of reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, new strategies must be
established to help facilitate the penetration of PS-loaded nanoparticles into tumors.
Recently, we found that the amphiphilic photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) was able to form a stable, water-soluble
coating on nanoclusters of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Due to the unique orientation
of Ce6 on the SPION surface, little to no quenching of singlet oxygen production was observed. This led to the
effective use of the Ce6-coated SPION nanoclusters (CSNs) as a PDT agent in a murine model of TNBC, leading
to a significant slowing of tumor growth. The overall goal of this proposal is to improve upon this work by
combining CSNs with mesothelin-targeting and magnetophoresis to improve the specificity, accumulation,
penetration, and efficacy of CSNs in treating TNBC. Magnetophoresis will be applied using a custom magnetic
device that can radially
profoundly
 disperse CSNs from any location in a living subject. This innovative technology will
improve the ability of CSNs to reach their intended targets.The specific aims for this proposal are as
follows: Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize the physical-chemical properties of mesothelin-targeted, Ce6-coated
SPION nanoclusters (CSNs) and characterize a 2nd generation magnetic device; Aim 2. Evaluate the tumor
accumulation and penetration of CSNs in a murine model of TNBC; Aim 3. Evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
PDT with CSNs in a murine model of TNBC."
10810711,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Background & Significance: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects 12 million people in the US (1 in 27
individuals). Individuals with diabetes are nearly 10 times more likely to develop end-stage surgical
complications such as critical limb ischemia (CLI) and major lower extremity amputation. This leads to
significant health, psychological, and financial burdens on surgical patients with diabetes. Therefore, it is
paramount to better understand this chronic disease process in order to develop more effective treatment
strategies, and improve the health of these patients.
 Fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist that lowers serum
triglycerides, is the only medication to date shown to reduce peripheral amputation rates in patients with
diabetes. However, it is unknown how Fenofibrate confers this benefit, and therefore it is seldom used in the
clinical management of surgical patients with diabetes and CLI who are at risk of amputation.
 De novo lipogenesis is a multi-step lipid synthesis pathway that is known to contribute to the pathogenesis
of diabetes in non-vascular organ tissue, and is regulated by fatty acid synthase (FAS) and
choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase-1 (CEPT1). Interplay between these enzymes can lead to activation
of PPARα-mediated signaling. It is unknown whether Fenofibrate can impact de novo lipogenesis, endothelial
cell (EC) lipid metabolism, and peripheral arterial atheroprogression in the setting of diabetes.
Preliminary Data: We observed that Fenofibrate can indeed affect peripheral limb perfusion in the setting of
altered de novo lipogenesis. We also observed that both CEPT1 and FAS are abundant in the peripheral
arterial intima of patients with diabetes and CLI. Additionally, we recently discovered that serum circulating
FAS (cFAS) is elevated in the serum of patients with advanced diabetes and CLI. Furthermore, cept1 knockout
in the endothelium leads to significantly reduced atheroprogression and normalization of serum lipid profiles.
Innovation: The main objective of this proposal is to determine whether de novo lipogenesis and Fenofibrate
can affect peripheral atheroprogression in the setting of diabetes. This line of investigation will be highly
innovative since it will address key knowledge gaps in the mechanisms that contribute to peripheral
atheroprogression in diabetes, and may help tailor therapy for surgical patients afflicted by this condition.
Specific Aims: We hypothesize that CEPT1 and cFAS are key players in EC lipid metabolism and have
important roles in peripheral arterial atheroprogression in the setting of diabetes and CLI. Using a complement
of biochemical techniques and already generated mouse lines, we will test this hypothesis in two aims: Aim 1
will determine whether CEPT1 and cFAS can affect peripheral arterial atheroprogression in the setting of
diabetes, and Aim 2 will determine whether Fenofibrate affects endothelial de novo lipogenesis and peripheral
atheroprogression."

Callous-unemotional behavior (CU behavior), characterized by atypically low empathy, prosociality and guilt,
represents a serious impairment in moral development associated with severe and persistent conduct problems,
violent crime, social rejection, and substance use disorders. Alarmingly, CU behaviors have been historically
difficult to treat. By age 3, CU behaviors are reliably measurable, predict CU into late childhood, and are already
associated with greater conduct and social problems. Despite this evidence, very few studies have examined
precursors of CU behaviors (i.e., emerging CU) or identified risk and protective factors during infancy and
toddlerhood, when morality develops rapidly and thus may be most malleable. This knowledge may identify more
precise risk and protective processes underlying emerging CU that may be targeted to prevent a highly impairing
psychosocial trajectory. Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2 to “chart mental illness trajectories to
determine when, where, and how to intervene,” this K23 application aims to identify neural correlates and
environmental, child dispositional, and parenting risk and protective factors for emerging CU behavior across
infancy and toddlerhood. To accomplish these aims, this proposal leverages an exceptional opportunity to add
measures to an NIH-funded study following a large, high-risk cohort of mother-infant dyads annually from birth
through age 3. The applicant will add critical measures to this parent study including observational and parent-
report assessments of emerging CU, an event-related potential (ERP) task, and experimenter-child interactions
to assess children's dispositions. This proposal will use ERPs to characterize neural markers of CU behavior
and examine whether aspects of children's environments (early life adversity) and dispositions (low affiliation)
measured in infancy predict maladaptive trajectories of emerging CU through age 3. Further, it will test whether
low parenting warmth is implicated in these risk trajectories and could thus be a protective factor targeted in
treatment. Findings will inform the developmental neurobiology of emerging CU behavior and elucidate promising
early prevention and treatment targets. To execute this proposal, the training plan in this application addresses
the applicant's need for training in 1) ERP assessment methods; 2) the developmental psychopathology of CU
behavior; and 3) longitudinal design and analysis. A rich training environment and a multidisciplinary team of
mentors in each of these areas is detailed. The described research and training activities will enable the
candidate to become an independent scientist investigating neural and psychosocial risk for aberrant moral
development and its role in the onset and maintenance of early childhood psychopathology."

 Neurons are among the most energetically-demanding cell types in the body, and as such, heavily rely on
the output of mitochondria to fuel their basic functionality. Because of this, a disproportionate number of genes
whose dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative disease are related to mitochondrial function. Of
particular importance to neuronal health and survival is the process of degrading mitochondria. Despite this
link, little is known about the cell biological pathways that mediate the breakdown of mitochondria in neurons
within their native, physiological environment in nervous tissue. The overall goal of this proposal is gain a
further understanding of the various pathways neurons utilize to break down their mitochondria.
 Within nervous tissue, neurons get support from a specialized cell type known as glial cells. It has recently
been discovered that knock down of the ataxia-associated gene Vps13D leads to the strong inhibition of a
neuron’s ability to break down their mitochondria via a pathway known as mitophagy. In response to this robust
inhibition, neurons adaptively induce an alternative means of mitochondrial breakdown that involves the
transfer of damaged mitochondria to supportive glial cells for their ultimate degradation. With the discovery of
this new pathway of mitochondrial degradation, the mentored phase of this proposal will use the robust
phenotype associated with loss of Vps13D to guide the development of tools for studying non-cell autonomous
mitochondrial degradation in neurons in vivo. This work will also uncover the conditions that lead to the
induction of this transcellular neuron to glia mitochondrial breakdown.
 In the independent phase of this proposal, the goal will be to use these newly developed tools to gain a
mechanistic understanding of how mitochondria are released from neurons. Using the powerful genetic tools
available in fruit fly research, this Aim will test out candidate molecules with a history of mediating intercellular
mitochondrial trafficking in other cell types to determine whether they participate in neuron to glial
mitochondrial transfer.
 Finally, the goal of the another focus of this proposal in the independent phase will be to determine if this
newly discovered, alternative form of mitochondrial degradation become adaptively more prevalent during the
course of aging as levels of autophagy decrease. Then, this Aim will test the cellular and functional
consequences of disrupting neuron-to-glial transfer of mitochondrial in this susceptible population of aged
neurons.
 With the completion of the research proposed in this application, the applicant will have carved out a
distinctive niche for an independent research career focusing on the cell biology of transcellular mitochondrial
degradation in neurons."

10755738,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapeutic treatments for cancer, especially the use of monoclonal antibody mediated blockade of
`checkpoint' molecules like PD-1, has changed the treatment paradigm for patients with solid tumors like
melanoma. However, only a subset of patients benefit from these therapies, due to several resistance
mechanisms concentrated within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the site of action of cytotoxic T cells. T
cells must contend with physical barriers to infiltration, immunosuppressive cell types, the expression of co-
inhibitory ligands on target cells, and a harsh metabolic environment produced by cancer cells. In addition to T
cell-extrinsic immunosuppression, T cells within tumors have a distinct differentiation trajectory, resulting in
acquisition of an alternative, dysfunctional fate termed exhaustion. Exhausted T cells are terminally
differentiated, hypofunctional upon stimulation, and possess poor capacity to proliferate, a crucial component
of immune memory. We and others have shown that exhausted T cells have severe metabolic deficiencies,
and that metabolic stress within the TME, most notably hypoxia exposure, potentiates differentiation towards
exhaustion. In line with this, we and others have shown that melanoma patients with more oxidative, hypoxic
tumors are more likely to progress on anti-PD1. Thus, the hypoxic TME and the intrinsic functional deficiency
of exhausted T cells are linked. However, how hypoxia and resultant oxidative stress alter T cell differentiation
remain unclear. Our hypothesis is that hypoxia exposure promotes T cell exhaustion, by driving aberrant
chromatin bivalency and loss of transcription, such that hypoxia mitigation treatments will alter T cell
differentiation and support increased T cell function. AIM 1: How does hypoxia drive epigenetic changes that
bias T cell differentiation and function? Hypoxia drives several cellular adaptations, including transcriptional
reprogramming via HIF-1α, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and metabolic shifts. We will A) use in
vitro systems to identify mechanisms of hypoxia contributing to altered histone methylation and bivalency in
murine T cells; and B) determine contributions of hypoxia to the T cell epigenome and explore potential
mitigation strategies in murine tumor models. AIM 2: How do hypoxia reducing regimens alter intratumoral T
cell differentiation in melanoma patients? We and other have shown that targeting tumor cell metabolism or
angiogenesis can increase the oxygen tension within tumors in both mouse models and melanoma patients. In
this Aim, we will take advantage of two investigator-initiated clinical trials in melanoma utilizing metformin or
axitinib in combination with anti-PD-1, and deeply explore transcriptional, epigenetic, metabolic, and functional
outcomes associated with reduction of hypoxia coincident with anti-PD-1. We expect these studies to address
knowledge gaps in the fields of epigenetics, immunology, and cancer immunotherapy, uncovering how tumor
hypoxia can bias T cell differentiation and response to anti-PD-1, with the goal of identifying novel targets that
mitigate hypoxia driven T cell exhaustion and overcome barriers to immunotherapy for cancer."
10754591,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The ability to rearrange vesicular traffic to create new membrane compartments de novo is a
fundamental cell biological process important for many aspects of cellular physiology and differentiation. Two
common examples of this phenomenon are the creation of autophagosomes and the generation of the ciliary
sheath. In both cases, vesicles coalesce on a protein substrate to create a small double membrane that
subsequently expands into a distinct organelle. Defects in these processes are associated with a variety of
diseases, highlighting the importance of this aspect of cellular physiology to human health. Prospore
membrane formation during the process of sporulation in budding yeast is another example of a de novo
membrane formation event. Prospore membrane formation occurs on the microtubule organizing center of the
cells, analogous to the ciliary sheath in higher cells, and the prospore membrane expands to encapsulate
cytoplasmic components, analogous to an autophagosome. These similarities are due to parallels at the
molecular level that make yeast sporulation a powerful model system to identify the underlying molecular
mechanisms of membrane assembly. The experiments in this proposal are focused on two aspects of this
process: 1) how the MOP promotes coalescence of vesicles to create the prospore membrane, and 2) how the
Vps13 lipid transfer protein promotes membrane expansion."

The overarching goal of this new R01 application is to investigate the dysregulation of mitochondrial networks
responsible for maintaining normal metabolism is an established hallmark of cancer. This disruption of cellular
metabolism, leads to the aberrant accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering maladaptive
signaling that is an emerging, novel mechanism leading to ionizing radiation (IR) resistance (IRR) as well as
enzalutamide (ENZ) resistance (ENZR). In this regard, recently identified a mitochondrial signaling axis centered
on manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) which, when the acetylation (Ac) status of lysine 68 (K68-Ac) is
altered, disrupts cellular metabolism, leading to aberrant ROS levels (Zhu, Nature Commun., 2019). In addition,
LNCaP cells expressing a MnSOD K68-Ac mimic mutant (MnSODK68Q) exhibited IRR/ENZR, increased HIF2α,
known to promote stemness properties, and two stem cell markers, Oct4 and SOX2. As such, we seek to show
that MnSOD-K68-Ac may drive IRR and/or ENZR, by altering MnSOD's structural composition and enzymatic
activity, and in a broader context, tumor growth and survival via a cell stemness-like mechanism. Finally, will
GC4419 exposure, a chemical agent that acts as a MnSOD mimic, reverse the IRR/ENZR phenotype? Thus, it
is It is hypothesized that prostate tumor cells exposed to IRR and/or ENZR increase MnSOD-K68-Ac, disrupting
normal MnSOD biology at the cellular and mitochondrial level (i.e., aberrant ROS), which initiates cellular
reprogramming, via increased HIF2α, leading to lineage plasticity properties, a change in tumor cell fate, and an
IRR and/or ENZR tumor phenotype. It is also proposed that MnSOD-K68-Ac is a novel axis for new therapeutic
interventions in IRR and IRR/ENZR tumors. Finally, through exposure to GC4419 that chemically replaces
MnSOD activity, we ask whether superoxide detoxification reverts/converts these IRR/ENZR prostate tumor cells
to a sensitive phenotype by restoring normal metabolism"

 Over 860,000 COVID-19 deaths have occurred in the U.S., and more than 5.5 million deaths have
occurred world-wide. Consequently, development of effective antiviral drugs that block infectivity and airway
inflammation continue to be a global health priority. Inflammation in the COVID-19 airway is due to increased
NFκB and Epithelial Sodium channel (ENaC) signaling. Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by
inactivating mutations in the CFTR gene, also has the same proinflammatory NFκB and ENaC signaling
phenotype in the airway. Using a differentiated human epithelial ""lung-on-a-chip"" platform, we find that ACE2,
the receptor protein for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, co-immunoprecipitates with CFTR. Furthermore,
exposure of differentiated epithelia to the SARS-COV-2 Spike protein dose-dependently suppresses cyclic
AMP-dependent CFTR chloride channel activity and CFTR protein expression. Spike-dependent loss of CFTR
also activates TRADD-dependent NFκB signaling and proteolytically activates ENaC. We have also found that
Spike-dependent loss of CFTR may be due to failure of endosomal recycling to return apical CFTR to the
plasma membrane. Finally, we find that nanoMolar concentrations of cardiac glycoside drugs such as
ouabain, digitoxin and digoxin, which competitively inhibit Spike:ACE2 binding, rescue Spike-dependent
reduction in CFTR activities. We have therefore hypothesized that binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to
ACE2 in the lung causes loss of CFTR signaling and activation of proinflammatory NFκB and ENaC
signaling. To further test this hypothesis we propose the following Specific Aims: SA #1: To define the
mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein reduces CFTR channel activity and CFTR protein
levels. We will determine the mechanism by which ACE2 interacts with CFTR. We will determine the
mechanism by which Spike protein interaction with ACE2 leads to loss of CFTR. SA#2: To define the
mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein drives activation of ENaC and NFκB signaling. We will
determine the mechanism by which Spike-induced loss of CFTR protein results in activation of TRADD-
dependent NFκB ENaC signaling. SA#3: To identify protective mechanisms of cardiac glycosides on cell
and animal models of COVID-19 disease. We will test whether cardiac glycoside drugs block native SARS-
CoV-2 infection of epithelia and rescue hamster models of COVID-19. .
Novelty and Significance: To our knowledge this is the first time COVID-19 airway inflammation has been
traced to inhibition of CFTR signaling. Consistently, COVID-19 patients who are also CF carriers, with only one
wildtype CFTR gene and only 50% of CFTR function, were recently reported to suffer more severe COVID-19
symptoms and earlier death than normal subjects with COVID-19."
10908994,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of human adult hemoglobin, which primarily afflicts
Americans of African descent. The mutant hemoglobin, Hb S, polymerizes upon deoxygenation, leading to
impaired red blood cell rheology, microvascular occlusion, chronic inflammatory state, and chronic hemolytic
anemia, culminating in chronic organ damage and a shortened life expectancy. SCD is an orphan disease, with
an estimated ~110,000 patients in the U.S. who suffer from disparities and discrimination and increased health
care utilization. Until recently, the management of the disease has been largely confined to symptom control,
with pain management and transfusions. In 1998, the U.S. FDA approved hydroxyurea (HU) as the first
disease modifying therapy for SCD. Subsequent studies in children and adults with SCD has confirmed the
beneficial effects of HU, with prevention of organ damage and decrease in mortality. In the past five years,
three additional disease modifying drugs (L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab) targeting different
mechanisms in disease pathophysiology have been approved by the FDA, broadening the available
therapeutic armamentarium for SCD. Although this is a welcomed development, knowledge gaps exist on the
choice of the most effective disease modifying therapy or combinations, based on a spectrum of sub-
phenotypes of the disease. This gap is unlikely to be filled by knowledge gained from randomized clinical trials
involving the use of FDA approved therapies. This application seeks to meet this unmet need by taking
advantage of the infrastructure (prospective Registry of 2400 SCD patients) provided by the NHLBI funded
Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (2016-2022) consisting of eight Centers throughout U.S. We
propose to approach this problem by enrolling 1200 patients (150 patients from each Center) by applying the
following specific aims: 1) Compare the effect of novel disease modifying therapies (L-glutamine, voxelotor,
and crizanlizumab) on clinical outcomes in individuals with SCD. We will follow these individuals prospectively
for 5 years, emulating data collection protocols and eligibility from key, interventional phase III SCD trials, and
monitor organ injury NT-proBNP for heart and lung injury, urine albumin/creatinine ratio for kidney function,
hemolysis score for blood, as well as symptom burden (ASCQ-Me) 2) Identify genetic and genomic predictors
of response to disease modifying therapies, by a) whole exome sequencing and b) RNA seq (mononuclear
cells, retics, platelets); and 3) integrate study data into the CureSCi metadata catalog to enhance future cross
study analyses."
10815779,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Biologics with potential
to affect underlying pathophysiology have failed to display significant therapeutic benefits in the clinic. The
inability of biologics to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents their biggest hurdle to clinical efficacy.
A promising strategy to address this challenge is to fuse IgGs to a second affinity ligand that engages a
cerebrovascular endothelial target and induces transport across the BBB. While nearly all prior efforts have
focused on the transferrin receptor (TfR-1) as the prototypical endothelial target despite inherent delivery and
safety challenges, we have developed a bispecific antibody shuttle that engages CD98hc, the heavy chain of
the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT-1). Notably, our preliminary data show preserved affinity and
specificity of off-the-shelf IgGs incorporated into our first-generation CD98hc bispecific shuttle, superior brain
retention of IgGs shuttled via CD98hc as compared to TfR-1, and preserved endothelial levels of CD98hc and
brain uptake after saturating CD98hc shuttle doses.The overall objective of this proposal is to further the
development of the CD98hc BBB shuttle by: i) defining the optimal characteristics for maximal IgG brain
parenchymal delivery; ii) evaluating age- and disease-dependent effects on CD98hc-mediated transport; and iii)
generating proof-of-concept efficacy data in an AD mouse model using agonist (anti-TrkB) and antagonist (anti-
phospho-tau) antibodies alone and in combination. Our central hypothesis is that IgG transport via the CD98hc
shuttles will increase parenchymal delivery and achieve brain concentrations and target engagement
comparable to viral delivery, generating robust neuroprotection in a tau mouse model, including potential additive
or synergistic neuroprotective effects by targeting two different neuroprotective pathways. Therefore, we propose
in Aim 1 to optimize brain parenchymal delivery of a second-generation CD98hc antibody shuttle. We will test
the impact of the valency, affinity, and epitope of CD98hc interaction on brain uptake and parenchymal delivery.
The optimal dose and construct identified using adult mice will be tested in aged wild-type and PS19 (tau P301S)
mice to evaluate the integrity of the transport pathway. Next, in Aim 2, we will assess the efficacy of individual
neuroprotective antibody/CD98hc shuttles in PS19 mice. Validated antibodies against TrkB (C20, agonist) and
phosphorylated tau (PHF1) will be individually delivered via our best CD98hc shuttle. Efficacy outcomes will be
levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, neuronal and synaptic loss, and cognitive deficits. Efficacy will be
tested in three modes of treatment, beginning at early, intermediate, and late stages of progression of AD
pathology and cognitive decline. Finally, in Aim 3, the efficacy of combinations of antibody shuttles targeting
multiple neuroprotective pathways in PS19 mice will be evaluated. These studies are expected to provide new
fundamental knowledge related to the CD98hc transport pathway and preclinical data for bispecific AD
therapeutics, including combination therapies that target mechanistically unique neuroprotective pathways."

Fifteen years ago, genetic studies identified an association between TCF7L2 and diabetes; more recently an
association with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was identified. Yet, the role of TCF7L2, particularly
in the liver, remains controversial. We think that progress to date has been hindered by (1) use of dominant
negative strategies to elucidate TCF7L2 function; (2) a restricted focus on glucose metabolism; (3) a lack of
appreciation of hepatocyte heterogeneity. That is, hepatocytes differ in transcriptional profile and function
depending on the anatomic zone in which they reside. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine
the role of TCF7L2 in regulating hepatic gene expression and metabolism. Our preliminary studies using mice
with acute deletion of Tcf7l2 in the liver show (1) TCF7L2 has zone-specific effects on gene expression; (2)
glucagon inhibits TCF7L2; and (3) disruption of TCF7L2 leads to alterations in amino acid, bile acid, and lipid
metabolism. Consequently, in response to a Western diet, mice with hepatic deletion of TCF7L2 show a
marked disruption in the size and zonation of lipid droplets, as well as an increase in hepatocyte injury. We
therefore hypothesize that TCF7L2 is a zone-keeper in the liver, necessary for maintaining homeostasis during
fasting/feeding transitions as well as the safe storage of lipids during overnutrition. To test this hypothesis, we
will use single-nuclei sequencing, novel mouse models to examine TCF7L2 chromatin binding in different
zones, and metabolomic approaches. We expect that these studies will broaden our understanding of
diabetes, and forge the way for developing personalized genotype-based strategies to prevent NAFLD and
other diabetic sequelae."
10917021,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)
Cancer cannot be cured unless the primary tumor is cured. For patients with locally advanced or unresectable
disease for whom initial surgery is not an option, radiation therapy (RT) combined with a systemic agent has
become the standard treatment. This is because systemic therapy alone can rarely cure gross disease, but can
significantly improve the efficacy of RT and eliminate microscopic disease. Therefore, as systemic therapies
continue to improve, the need for effective local control becomes increasingly important. Although technical
improvements in planning and delivery have decreased the toxicity of RT, RT dose escalation trials have, in
general, failed to improve outcome. The overarching hypothesis of this SPORE proposal is that combining
RT with systemic therapy that targets the molecular drivers of locally advanced cancers will improve the
outcome of treatment. The goal of this SPORE proposal is to test this hypothesis through in vitro and in vivo
preclinical studies targeting key mechanisms of radiation resistance. Our studies will motivate pilot clinical trials
that will define the conditions for phase II trials, yield an initial assessment of response, and test the preclinical
hypotheses through correlative studies. This goal will be achieved through three specific aims. Aim 1 will
determine if primary radiation resistance, the presence of occult metastatic disease, and a lack of
immunogenicity can be targeted by increasing radiation-induced DNA damage using a PARP inhibitor with
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We test this strategy in preclinical and clinical studies combining olaparib,
RT, and durvalumab in pancreatic cancer. Aim 2 will determine if the radiation resistance due to unique tumor
metabolism, specifically, elevated purine levels, can be targeted. We test this hypothesis in preclinical and
clinical studies of glioblastoma using the purine depleting CNS-penetrant FDA approved agent mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF). Aim 3 will determine if the radiation resistance due to aberrant cell cycle control and activated
DNA repair can be targeted in tumor cells with intact retinoblastoma protein (RB) using CDK4/6 inhibitors. We
test this hypothesis in preclinical studies and in a clinical trial treating women with locally advanced ER+
(and, in the future, if supported by preclinical data, triple negative) breast cancer using RT with concurrent
abemaciclib. These projects will be supported by the five cores: Administrative, Translational Pathology,
Biostatistics & Computational Biology, Clinical Trials, and Radiosensitization. We have a strong history of
vertical translation: our prior early phase trials in these three disease have progressed to multi-institutional
trials We do not know of another group that can carry out integrated preclinical and clinical studies
which have a significant chance of decreasing the morbidity and mortality of three common and
difficult to treat cancers by increasing the RT sensitivity and immunogenicity of tumors through
targeting their molecular drivers using clinically available agents."

We discovered that inhibitors of the DDR (DNA damage response) enhance radiation-induced T1IFN (Type I
interferon)-mediated innate immunity and, subsequently, adaptive immunity. We have also shown that PARP
inhibitors are radiation sensitizers with unique properties in inducing lesions at radiation-induced DNA damage
sites. In this application, we investigate their combination with radiation as a strategy to induce innate immunity
and sensitize PDAC (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) to immunotherapy. We confirm, in agreement with a
clinical study, that radiation alone is a weak immune stimulator. In contrast, the combination of radiation with
the PARP inhibitor olaparib strongly induces T1IFN-mediated innate immunity in PDAC resulting in sensitization
of both local and systemic tumors to immunotherapy. Taken together these data support our proposed clinical
trial combining olaparib, radiation and durvalumab in patients with LAPC (locally advanced pancreatic cancer).
The overall goal of this proposal is to preclinically develop a strategy combining PARP inhibitors with radiation
for sensitizing PDAC to ICB (immune checkpoint blockade) by promoting tumor cell DNA damage and
immunogenicity that will be translated to a clinical trial in LAPC patients. We will accomplish this in 3 specific
aims. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate novel mechanisms of innate immune modulation and their T1IFN-dependent
phenotypic consequences by PARP inhibitors with radiation in PDAC cells. Our preliminary data show, in
contrast to PARP inhibitor alone, that the PARP inhibitor olaparib synergizes with radiation to reduce survival
and induce a T1IFN innate immune response in HR (homologous recombination) proficient PDAC. Aim 1 will
define novel mechanisms of T1IFN generation and its subsequent phenotypic consequences. We anticipate
defining novel pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways initiated by olaparib and radiation-induced DNA
damage or replication stress that result in increased tumor innate immunity. Specific Aim 2 will determine the
therapeutic benefit and molecular endpoints of combined therapy with PARP inhibitor, radiation and ICB in
PDAC. We will define the local and systemic anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity of high or lower dose per fraction
radiation (i.e., SBRT, stereotactic body radiation or standard fractioned radiation) and the optimal schedule with
olaparib and anti-PD-L1. We will establish endpoints in tumors and blood reflecting DNA damage, tumor innate
and adaptive immunity, as well as the broader immune profile (CyTOF). We expect to achieve a favorable
therapeutic index with SBRT that is associated with tumor DNA damage and T1IFN-mediated innate and
adaptive immunity. In Specific Aim 3, we will conduct a clinical trial of olaparib, radiation, and durvalumab in
patients with LAPC. We will dose escalate olaparib using the Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method
(TiTE-CRM) with the combination of SBRT (unless otherwise informed by Aim 2) and the PD-L1 blocking
antibody durvalumab in patients with LAPC. We anticipate that we will achieve a safe and efficacious
combination of olaparib with radiation and durvalumab that promotes maximal immunogenicity and
motivates a randomized phase 2 trial to ultimately improve survival in patients with LAPC."

Radiation plays a central role in the management of the most lethal central nervous system malignancy,
glioblastoma (GBM), yet local control rates, and hence survival, remain dismal for this disease. Even novel
therapies, such as immunotherapy, have not shown efficacy in the treatment of GBM. Meanwhile, radiation
dose escalation studies have demonstrated improved local control. However, dose escalated treatments are
hindered by the increased incidence of radiation induced brain necrosis in surrounding tissues. High LET
particle therapy holds the potential to both increase tumor cell kill and decrease normal tissue toxicity, yet
the data required to develop models for clinical treatments regarding the biological effectiveness of high LET
beams on normal brain tissue and GBM cells is sparse. This fact is especially true when considering results
reported utilizing the appropriate environment for the origination and growth of GBM cells – the human
brain. We have implemented recently developed high accuracy models which are truly beginning to
recapitulate the native GBM niche in order to correlate both necrosis induction and progression and tumor
cell response with the physical parameters of particle beams. These models include multi-cell type human
brain organoids (cerebral organoids) as well as immune-competent orthotopic rodent models. Using these
models, we will identify the physical factors of particle beams which may lead to necrosis. This is significant
in that this data will aid the design of safer treatments by reducing necrosis and improving disease control.
In the second component of our study, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of necrosis and
neuroinflammation. Rather than being a simple accidental, disorganized death, we will determine if radiation
induces an orderly programmed cell death pathway. Overall, we will conduct the following aims; (1) identify
the optimal particle and fractionation for treatment of GBM, (2) explore the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of radiation induced brain damage, and (3) develop biological effect models for clinical use.
The knowledge gained will quickly influence the treatment of brain tumor patients and expedite the clinical
introduction heavy ion therapy for glioblastoma."
10816463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast-conserving surgery (BCS), or lumpectomy, has become standard for the treatment of breast cancers.
The goal of BCS is to remove the cancer and enough surrounding tissue to reduce the chance of tumor
recurrence (clear margins) but retain as much of the normal breast appearance as possible. Although BCS has
many advantages, residual tumor (positive margins) are found on post-operative pathology in 5–40% of cases,
often necessitating an additional surgery and potential for treatment delays, increased healthcare costs, patient
anxiety, and suboptimal cosmetic outcomes. Obtaining clear margins at the time of the initial breast surgery
also has implications for malignancy, as margin status is the chief determinant of local recurrence. Therefore,
technologies providing intraoperative margin assessment, in which real-time surgical guidance is most often
coordinated with the pathology team, has the potential to substantially reduce the need for additional surgeries,
improve patient outcomes, and increase health care value.
 Various methods have been proposed and evaluated for intraoperative breast margin assessment, including
gross evaluation, frozen section analysis, optical and non-optical imaging, and others. While each of these
techniques are suggested to reduce positive margin rates over non-guided surgeries, they also have inherent
limitations (e.g. processing time, cost, permanent tissue changes), with varying degrees of sensitivity and
specificity. Accordingly, a single intraoperative method has yet to be widely accepted into clinical practice and
post-operative pathology remains the gold-standard for diagnosis and margin evaluation.
 The ideal tool for intraoperative BCS assessments would have a high degree of sensitivity to detect all
tumor in the margins, regardless of tumor type, and, since diagnosis is not the intended outcome, specificity
should be high enough to both limit false positives and the rate of return surgeries. To this end, we propose
FIBI (Fluorescence Imitating Brightfield Imaging) for rapid, high-quality imaging of BCS tissues. We will use our
already existing FIBI technology to engineer a novel system, Giga FIBI, capable of assessing large areas (up
to 100 x 100 mm2) of fresh tissue, eliminating the need for substantial processing or sectioning. Through a
series of validation studies, we will show that Giga FIBI generates microscopic images at a quality comparable
to gold-standard histology from large surfaces within just minutes. Unlike other existing methodologies for
imaging tissue directly without sectioning (slide-free techniques), Giga FIBI is a technically simple and cost-
effective solution that is non-destructive, preserves orientation, and leaves the tissue available for downstream
permanent histology or molecular tests.
 The practical guidance provided by Giga FIBI is expected to markedly enhance intraoperative breast tumor
margin assessment to minimize repeat surgeries, local recurrence, and improve patient outcomes."
10784601,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
During enamel formation (amelogenesis) the regulation of extracellular pH (pHe) is critical as shown by
multiple mutant mice lines. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) export to the enamel matrix involves anion exchanger 2 (AE2)
and members of the SLC26A gene family. AE2 is localized to the lateral membrane of maturation ameloblasts,
while SLC26A1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 all localize to the apical/distal membrane of these same cells. In maturation
ameloblasts SLC26A proteins colocalize with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) and function together to allow for the export of HCO3- and the bidirectional movements of chloride ions
(Cl-) as part of the pHe regulatory process. In other polarized epithelial cell types of a secretory nature,
SLC26A proteins and CFTR form a network with cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin) at the apical pole
dictating, to a large part, cell polarity and microvilli projections. NHERF1/SLC9A3R1 and Ezrin proteins are
also involved with this network interaction. The pH-sensitive sodium dependent phosphate transporter
(SLC34A2/NaPi2b), an inorganic phosphate (Pi) import channel also localizes to the apical pole of maturation
ameloblasts, which may suggest a direct link between pHe regulation and Pi transport activities during enamel
mineralization events. Data suggests that miRNAs, targeting the mRNAs of specific ion transport proteins,
also influence ion transport and pHe regulation. Our prior whole transcriptome analysis of maturation and
secretory enamel organ cells identify a potential role for miR-298 and miR-346 in the regulation of NHERF1,
Slc26a1, Slc26a7 and Cftr. In this application we hypothesize that a “SLC26A/CFTR/NHERF1/NaPi2b
network, directing ion movements directly related to HCO3- and Pi transport and pH regulation, while at the
same time dictating apical membrane architecture, is critical for enamel maturation, and disruptions to this
network result in enamel pathologies that will severely impact on enamel longevity.” We propose the following
specific aims: 1) immunolocalization of NHERF1, EZRIN, CFTR and NaPi2b in maturation ameloblasts; 2)
disrupt SLC26A/CFTR/NHERF1/NaPi2b network in enamel organ cells in vivo using miR-346 and miR-298
delivered directly at the site of mineralization; and; 3) investigate the nature of the NHERF1 and NaPi2b
interactions in enamel organ cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study we anticipate that disrupting the
SLC26A/CFTR network and NaPi2b activity, by directly targeting NHERF1 function, will result in a significant
enamel dysmorphology. Findings from this study will have a significant impact on our understanding of the
biomineralization process as it relates to enamel formation in all mammalian species. This study may also
lead to strategies for handling inherited enamel defects in the clinic; and, in the long run help to prevent and
alleviate the suffering of those afflicted with cystic fibrosis and other diseases."
10761721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adult stem cells hold broad-ranging clinical potential to regenerate injured tissues. For instance, mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated in over 950 clinical trials for use in many disease indications.
Despite their significant clinical relevance, however, there is currently lack of the mechanistic understanding to
precisely control MSC functions for reproducible therapeutic outcomes. Engineered hydrogels have been used
to reveal the ability of MSCs to sense and respond to matrix biophysical cues, which subsequently impact the
differentiation potential of MSCs. However, leveraging these insights for therapeutic purposes has been
challenging, since current approaches to interface a cell population with a hydrogel by uncontrolled mixing
overlook the significance of heterogeneity in the local amount of the gel presented to individual cells, leading to
variable and unclear cell-material interactions at the single cell level. We describe herein a highly efficient
approach to control microscale hydrogel deposition around single cells in a 3D space independently of gel
composition and elasticity. Using this approach, our preliminary data show that MSCs rapidly expand in volume
when they adhere to an integrin ligand in thinner gels. We show that encapsulating single MSCs in a thin gel
coating is sufficient to enhance the osteogenic potential of MSCs even when gel elasticity is low. We will build
upon these results to test the hypothesis that controlling local gel deposition around single MSCs impacts
membrane tension and lineage specification by regulating cell volume expansion. In Aim 1, we will determine
the effect of varying local gel deposition on regulatory volume decrease by modulating mechanosensitive ion
channels and its impact on membrane tension of MSCs. In Aim 2, we will determine how varied local gel
deposition impacts single MSC fate and MSC-based bone regeneration. We predict that there exists a
transcriptional program that is selectively activated when the gel deposition becomes thinner, thereby
impacting lineage specification of MSCs independently of gel elasticity. The project is highly multidisciplinary in
that it will employ a combination of expertise in biomaterials, biophysical, genetic, and in vivo approaches to
address the specific aims. The results will help to define local gel deposition as an important determinant of
stem cell growth, thereby impacting stem cell mechanics and fate. Given the clinical relevance of these cells,
our results will inform formulation design of MSC-based therapeutics for improved regenerative outcomes."

Physician-scientists serve a critical role in helping bridge the gap between basic and translational research and
as noted in PAR-20-094 “bring a unique perspective to research through [a] blend of clinical and research
experiences.” Thus training Psychiatrists for future careers as physician-scientists is significant and aligns well
with NIMH priorities to “strive for prevention and cures” and “increase the public health impact of research.”
This proposal seeks to recruit 2 promising physician scientists per year, with careful attention to diversity, into
the Pathways-RRT, a longitudinal research program within the University of Colorado Psychiatry residency.
The Pathways-RRT allows residents to complete all ACGME requirements for on time graduation and to sit for
board certification, while also creating individualized pathways for research skills development and productivity
during residency. The program provides between 14 and 18 months of research-dedicated time across
residency (amount of time depends on whether applicants enter Child Fellowship training where they will
continue their research training). Residents will be recruited based on their qualifications, demonstrated
passion for research, and in part, upon their areas of interest being in sync with our current and growing pool of
outstanding primary research faculty mentors. Program participants receive structured didactics focusing on
research design, biostatistics, rigor and reproducibility, the ethical conduct of research, and grant writing. A
Pathways-RRT seminar offers opportunities for work-in-progress sessions and presentation of research results
(poster, oral) with faculty and peer feedback. PGY3/CRY1 Pathways-RRT residents have small grants
available to support data collection focusing on answering important questions and to serve as pilot data for
future grant applications. The program offers close mentorship and utilizes individualized research plans,
collaborative mentoring teams, annual progress reports, surveys of residents and program faculty to evaluate
program strengths and weaknesses to foster continuous program improvement. Participants benefit from
complementary institutional commitment including the Psychiatry Research Innovations services (a $360,000
per year commitment to provide participants research support including grants administration, research
operations, educational workshops, pilot grant opportunities, clinical research support, and biostatistics). The
program seeks to prepare residents to compete for post-doctoral research fellowships and grant funding (e.g.,
NRSA, R21, K) and to prepare them to assume faculty positions at strong academic institutions pursuing
research-oriented careers. Thus, the program seeks to address the dearth of physician-scientists in Psychiatry
and to produce actionable resident-derived research products that enhance knowledge regarding the causes of
mental illness and improve clinical outcomes for patients."
10765645,"Project Abstract
Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrheal disease (cryptosporidiosis) and death among young children
living in resource-poor settings. In the US, Cryptosporidium is the major cause of waterborne outbreaks linked
to recreational water use. Currently, there is no fully effective drug and no vaccine to treat or prevent
cryptosporidiosis. The only available US FDA approved drug, nitazoxanide has no proven efficacy in young
children with weak immune status and immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
develop new drugs and vaccine to reduce the burden of cryptosporidiosis. Progress in anti-cryptosporidial drug
and vaccine development has been hampered due to our limited understanding of parasite biology. The
underlying reasons for this slow progress have been the unavailability of a robust method to continuously
propagate Cryptosporidium, and the absence of molecular genetics to manipulate the parasite genome. We have
overcome these hurdles by developing a powerful technology to manipulate the Cryptosporidium genome and
propagate these genetically modified parasites in an immunocompromised mouse model system. The key
advantage of this genetic system is that the entire life cycle of Cryptosporidium (both asexual and sexual stages)
is completed in the mouse intestine, allowing us to unravel parasite biology (Vinayak et al 2015, Nature 523:477).
We lack an understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms that control development of parasite stages
for successful completion of the complex life cycle. Signaling pathway components such as the plant-like
calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) have emerged as attractive drug targets in Cryptosporidium and
related parasites, due to the absence of their homologues in human host. Taking advantage of our genetic
system, we have demonstrated the efficacy of selective bumped kinase inhibitors against calcium-dependent
protein kinase-1 (CDPK1), thus indicating a critical role of this signaling kinase in C. parvum. Utilizing the
conditional protein degradation system recently developed in our laboratory, we have demonstrated the essential
role of CDPK1 in asexual proliferation and parasite survival. Moreover, we have compelling preliminary evidence
that sheds light on the role of two signaling kinases in sexual developmental stages. The goal of this project is
to elucidate the mechanistic role of these signaling proteins in regulating development of asexual and sexual
stages in C. parvum required for parasite proliferation and transmission. Elucidation of these mechanisms will
provide novel insights into the fundamental biology of Cryptosporidium, and open new avenues for development
of effective therapies."
10821453,"Anti-Aging Molecule Sirt6 in Neuroprotection in Diabetic Retina
SUMMARY
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent cause of blindness in working age adults in the US today. It was
traditionally characterized as microvascular complications due to its clinical manifestation of a period of vascular
leakage and degeneration followed by neovascularization. However, recent studies in animal models and
patients have shown that retinal neuron injury, in particular retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and loss,
occurs at early stage of DR and contributes to vision loss. Moreover, though less studies, dysfunction and
degeneration of axons of RGC is also evident in diabetes. Current therapies for DR targets clinically significant
vascular leakage or neovascularization, which happens much later, and do not protect retinal neurons. This
project is to delineate the mechanisms of RGC injury and axonal degeneration during DR in order to identify
novel strategies to limit injury and preserve vision. Increasing evidence indicates that stress-induced premature
senescence (SIPS) plays a key role in many diseases. There are a few studies reporting SIPS in DR but they
are exclusively focused on endothelial cells and have not linked SIPS to DR pathology. There is a significant
knowledge gap on how Db induce SIPS in the retina and how to regulate such mechanisms for DR treatment.
Sirt6 is a key anti-aging molecule belonging to the sirtuin family that is evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases and shares homolog with yeast Sir2 protein, a
critical regulator of the lifespan of yeast. We now propose to test a hypothesis that Sirt6 suppresses chronic
activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)-ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) pathway to prevent
dysfunction/degeneration of RGCs and their axons in DR, partly by inhibiting RGC senescence and
mitochondrial dysfunction. We will use our newly developed Sirt6 global and conditional knockout
(KO)/overexpression mice, AAV2-mediated gene knockdown, clinic-relevant non-invasive imaging and
functional tests, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry and morphometric analyses to test this hypothesis. This
study will identify novel roles of Sirt6 and DDR-ATM pathway in RGC and axonal degeneration in DR and
establish a link between these them. It will also provide proof-of-concept that boosting anti-aging mechanisms
may be utilized to treat DR."

To improve overall outcome in multiple myeloma (MM), period this project in the current funding achieved three
major goals: 1: Defined the role of transplant in the era of novel agents with long term maintenance; 2:
Established the feasibility of measuring minimal residual disease (MRD) at 10-6 sensitivity, and demonstrated its
significant impact on prolongation of PFS irrespective of the type of treatment used; and 3) Demonstrated that
quadruplet therapies achieve high frequency of MRD negative response. In this renewal application, we now
propose to build upon our highly successful collaborative clinical study to address the next most important
question, whether high-dose therapy (HDT) can still provide benefit in patients achieving MRD negative status.
We hypothesize that quadruplet therapy followed by ASCT will achieve deeper MRD negative status (10-6), and
that sustained MRD negativity will be of therapeutic importance. Our proposed study will: 1) define the role of
ASCT in MM in the context of quadruplet induction therapy; determine whether ASCT further decreases tumor
burden, increases MRD negativity rates (NGS, 10-6), and improves patient outcome; and define whether
achieving early, late, and sustained MRD negativity impacts clinical outcome (Sp Aim 1). We will conduct a large
(n=716) study using induction therapy with isatuximab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IsaKRD)
and then randomize those patients who are MRD negative to either further IsaKRD versus HDT. In Specific Aim
2, we will redefine new risk stratification incorporating MRD status and modern biochemical, genomic,
epigenomic, and immune and microenvironmental correlates. Our proposed study will determine the impact of
MRD informing prognosis and therapy.

The goal of this U19 Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (CARB) Interdisciplinary Research Unit (CARBIRU)
application is to gain a deeper understanding of bacteria and host factors that play a role in antibacterial
resistance and infection. To meet this goal, the establishment of the Organoid Cultivation Core (OCC) will allow
the provision of critical biologically relevant human organotypic cultures that are essential for the success of the
project. The OCC will be organized around two goals: 1) development of human derived organoids from the
vagina, the bladder and the nasal airway for use by the individual projects and (2) production of organoids for
each project to assist in meeting their individual stated research goals. These goals will offer the ability to test
key hypotheses about the role of the host epithelium and develop key outcomes that can be translated into
understanding bacterial infections and antibacterial resistance. The core will reduce labor, supply and equipment
costs, and time required to complete projects by centralizing the isolation, growth, and maintenance of the
organoid lines. Bulk acquisition of materials required to culture organoids, standardization of conditioned media
containing growth factors, and centralization of the maintenance of the lines result in significant time and cost
savings to the individual Project investigators and ensures standardization and reproducibility. Additionally, the
OCC core will enhance communication and comparability of results obtained between projects. The OCC core

10812351,"ABSTRACT: National Alcohol Surveys: Advancing Epidemiologic Analyses of 21st Century Drinking
Hazardous alcohol use remains one of the most common preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the
US and it manifests major racial/ethnic and other disparities. Nationally representative surveys repeated over
time provide a means to advance survey methods, monitor trends in alcohol use overall and in sub-groups, and
investigate timely health topics related to alcohol use. The Alcohol Research Group and its Center have
conducted a series of National Alcohol Surveys (NAS) for forty years, and are proposing in this Project to conduct
the 15th edition of the NAS in 2023-2024 (termed N15). Through the implementation of the N15 we will respond
to challenges to modern-day survey research by employing a multi-mode, adaptive survey design. This will
include a fully web-based survey using address-based sampling, and probability and non-probability web panels.
Further, this will be the first NAS to include biosample collection using dried blood spots (DBS). Including an
additional NAS in the series will expand the trend data available for framing recent changes in alcohol
consumption patterns, which is also essential for age-period-cohort models for understanding components of
these trends. With NAS series data from 2000-2020 we propose to evaluate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
disparities in alcohol use and alcohol problems, and risk relationships between alcohol use patterns and
problems using causal inference methods including instrumental variables based on alcohol tax estimates and
other policy measures. Such methods have yet to be applied to the study of disparities in alcohol-related
problems. Capitalizing on the expanded trends data, we propose to examine trends for total and beverage-
specific alcohol volume, alcohol use disorder, and co-use of alcohol with marijuana and other drugs from 1979
or 1984, dependent on the availability of measures, to 2024 with age-period-cohort decompositions. Alcohol and
drug co-use, particularly cannabis, is especially timely given the legalization of recreational marijuana use in
many states and the ongoing opioid crisis. Psychological distress (PD) is a likely driver of the opioid crisis and
“deaths of despair”. Recent NAS editions have included measures of PD, a common problem for which alcohol
use is a known risk factor. However, less well understood are the individual- and environmental-level moderators
and biological mediators of this relationship. Collecting DBS samples will enable the study of inflammation as a
biological mediator of the relationship between alcohol use and PD, which could inform future research and
prevention interventions. Further, a better understanding of the moderators of the relationship between alcohol
use and PD, from individual- to community-level characteristics, could help to prioritize groups to receive
prevention interventions. In summary, this project proposes data collection and analyses that can advance both
methodological issues and substantive research questions with the aim of better understanding and addressing
21st century drinking and its trends, correlates and consequences."
10812356,"ABSTRACT: Health Disparities in Alcohol Use and Other Risk Behaviors after the Onset of Cancers
 and Cardiovascular Disease-Related Condition
The proposed Health Disparities in Alcohol Use and Other Risk Behaviors after the Onset of Cancers and
Cardiovascular Disease-Related Condition is a continuation of the 2016-2020 Health Disparities Project
focusing on alcohol's role in health outcomes. We shift our attention to patterns of drinking and other health
risk behaviors among individuals with diagnosed health conditions focusing on diabetes, hypertension,
heart/coronary problem, and cancer as well as multimorbidity among these conditions. As continued
heavy drinking with these conditions carries risks for increased morbidity and mortality, which are likely to be
further elevated when combined with other health risk behaviors (such as obesity, physical inactivity and tobacco
and other drug use), there is a critical need for multifaceted interventions to address these. However, few studies
investigating health behaviors following diagnosis or treatment for specific health conditions have focused on
alcohol use or the clustering of risky drinking with other risk behaviors. Furthermore, little has been documented
regarding population knowledge of alcohol's role in disease risk, which may also influence decisions about
drinking. To increase the knowledge base for improved interventions, the proposed research will address three
specific aims. First, analyses of drinking patterns after diagnosis of cancers, hypertension, diabetes,
heart problems, and alcohol-attributed health harms using the 2015, 2020 and 2024 NAS will evaluate the
impacts of condition onset on drinking patterns and the correlates of continued risky drinking. Second,
examination of current drinking patterns, other lifestyle risk factors (physical activity and
overweight/obesity), and substance use (tobacco, marijuana, and illicit drugs) in individuals with above-
stated conditions and multi-morbidity among them will identify the clustering among these behaviors with
attention to differences across gender, age, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status defined groups. These
analyses will utilize the 2010-2020 NAS and 2015-2020 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Third,
evaluation of the predictors of knowledge regarding alcohol's role in cancers and other health conditions
and disparities in these, utilizing the 2020 NAS and the National Cancer Institute's 2017 Health Information
National Trends Survey, will identify groups and characteristics associated with accurate knowledge of alcohol
as a risk factor for each condition and the sources of information associated with accurate knowledge. Each Aim
will evaluate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status disparities as well as gender and age-related differences.
Advanced epidemiologic models including generalized estimating equation modeling, propensity score
weighting, and latent class analysis will be utilized as appropriate.

hope to focus on the understanding of abnormal immune responses with disease pathogenesis, such that we 
provide a better understanding of how when the immune response is altered, immunopathology or disease 
development ensues. This focused research area is in line with our current expertise and with our new 
targeted junior faculty hiring plan (3 new tenure track faculty have been hired in 2019 that fit directly with the

generation of prostate cancer researchers, 2) Develop common resources to promote advances, 3) Translate
promising new approaches into patients, and 4) Improve overall survival and quality of life for patients with
prostate cancer. A crosscutting theme that encompasses this SPORE is understanding tumor resistance in
advanced prostate cancer and exploiting this knowledge to improve patient outcomes. The UW Prostate Cancer
SPORE has three primary research projects: 1) Tumor Microenvironment Initiators of the Metastatic Cascade in
High-Risk Prostate Cancer, 2) Androgen Deprivation as an Immune Modulating Therapy in Combination with
Targeted Immunotherapy of Prostate Cancer, and 3) Extending Clinical Benefit by Selective Treatment of
Resistant Lesions in mCRPC. The SPORE will support this research with three Cores (Administrative, Integrated
Pathology Radiology, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics). The Career Enhancement Program and
Developmental Research Program will engage new and established investigators and further translational goals
in a rich multidisciplinary environment. When completed, the research of the UW Prostate Cancer SPORE will
advance our treatments and understanding of prostate cancer and undoubtedly beneficially impact patients with
this disease."
10758605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A large, diverse set of common human diseases, and most of the biomedically-relevant traits that model
organism biologists routinely target, are complex and polygenic. Population variation in these traits has a
sizeable genetic component, and dissecting this variation can yield improved diagnostics and therapeutics, and
enable detailed descriptions of the molecular and cellular processes underlying disease and trait variation.
 Genomewide association studies (GWAS) are largely responsible for dramatic progress in the analysis
of human complex traits in recent years. GWAS have linked many genes to variation in human health, and
imply a significant fraction of trait variation is controlled by thousands of tiny-effect, primarily regulatory sites
spread along the genome. Despite this critical insight, there remain many gaps in our understanding of the
nature of causative loci. One notable caveat of the GWAS approach is its inherent bias towards intermediate-
frequency alleles; GWAS are ill-suited to uncovering rare alleles of large effect and genes harboring several
individually-rare mutations, events that mutation-selection balance models predict contribute to trait variation.
 The dissection of complex traits in model organisms offers great experimental flexibility, and the
opportunity to deploy methods synergistic with the dominant GWAS paradigm, yielding a more complete
picture of the genetic basis of trait variation. With this in mind we established the DSPR (Drosophila Synthetic
Population Resource) as a shareable toolkit for complex trait analysis in flies. The set of 1600 DSPR strains
were derived from 15 highly-characterized founder genotypes, and represent the most extensive multiparental
population (MPP) available in animals. The DSPR is used by many research groups, has enabled the
identification of thousands of QTL, and has associated rare alleles with trait variation. The DSPR complements
GWAS approaches for uncovering the full spectrum of allelic variation contributing to complex traits.
 In Aim 1 we will validate and refine the genotypes of all DSPR strains, strengthening the living resource
we will continue to share with the Drosophila community, and enhance the usability of the collection by
integrating analytical routines into the powerful R/qtl2 software platform. In Aim 2 we will extend the DSPR, and
enable extreme QTL (or X-QTL) mapping. For many traits, an efficient and user-friendly strategy to identify
QTL is to compare allele frequencies in phenotypically-extreme recombinant populations to those in control
cohorts. We will derive such mixed DSPR populations, experimentally refine our approach, and distribute
populations and software to facilitate novel, investigator-driven research. In Aim 3 we will broaden the utility of
the DSPR to explore the nature of expression regulation. Using a host-pathogen model, we will exploit the
rapid regulatory change that occurs during the immune response to develop dynamic eQTL mapping methods,
finding loci that contribute to variation in the trajectory of the regulatory reaction. These general resources will
allow researchers employing any MPP to move beyond static pictures of gene expression in populations."
10767301,"The ability to effectively study and develop innovative treatments for acute critically ill or injured patients remains challenging. Many of these devastating conditions occur infrequently while time-sensitivity of treatments challenge the capacity to obtain prospective informed consent, impeding the ability to enroll large numbers of patients into clinical trials. Yet, the current therapies for many of these devastating conditions are often understudied or unsatisfactory. To this end, the Strategies to Innovate Emergency Care Clinical Trials network (SIREN) provides a national structure to pool resources to address these challenges and advance emergency care. In this proposal we seek to continue our contributions to the SIREN network. These contributions include high numbers of high quality patient enrollments to all funded clinical trials, innovation and dissemination of pragmatic, cost-effective, and ethical advances in the conduct of emergency care research, support of prehospital and Exception From Informed Consent (EFIC) study procedures, and training of the next generation of emergency care clinical trialists. The proposed Upper Midwest hub represents a growth of the prior University of Minnesota hub, with expanding reach and inclusion of sites across the Midwest with a focus on growing rural and teleresearch capacity. Our hub brings academic depth and breadth across wide domains of acute critical care, pre-hospital and emergency research. Hub leadership is experienced in the spectrum of acute care clinical research, pre-hospital research, the use of Exception from Informed Consent for acute critical care clinical trials, positioning us well to conduct all manner of trials supported by the network, while the multidisciplinary specialties needed to collaborate for successful implementation of SIREN are well aligned with collaborative arrangements beyond traditional academic departments."

The central goal of this project is to understand fundamental mechanisms of human pre-mRNA
splicing, a required step in the expression of most eukaryotic genes, as well as the regulation of
alternative splicing. Specific mechanisms through which exons and introns are correctly identified
by the spliceosome will continue to be investigated. These studies will focus on recognition of the
canonical and non-canonical splice sites by snRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, and on contextual
effects due to other pre-mRNA features, such as splicing enhancer elements recognized by SR
proteins. The mechanisms of action and specificity of antisense-oligonucleotide and small-
molecule splicing modulators will be explored, as will the interplay between alternative splicing
and chromatin. In addition, the network of protein-protein interactions of the SR protein SRSF1
will continued to be investigated, with the goal of obtaining structural insights about its various
functions in splicing. This project will rely on integrative approaches, including molecular,
bioinformatics, biochemical, biophysical, proteomics, cell biology, and pharmacological
techniques, as well as in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo assays. In addition to obtaining new insights
into basic mechanisms of gene expression, these studies will improve the understanding of
numerous mutations associated with various genetic diseases, as well as facilitate correct genetic
diagnosis and therapeutics development for such diseases."
10756130,"Summary
CRISPR/cas9 gene editing has shown great promise for the treatment of genetic hematologic
disorders including sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. Current therapeutic strategies are
primarily focused on ex vivo gene editing of autologous patient-derived hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), which require isolation of patients’ HSPCs, ex vivo gene editing,
selection and expansion of corrected HSPCs, and transplantation back into the patients.
Despite its initial success, the clinical translation of this technique is hampered by the difficulties
in ex vivo processing of HSPCs, the risks associated with myeloablation, the low engraftment
efficiency, and the prohibitively high cost of individualized cell therapy. Recent studies have
shown that HSPCs are sustained in specialized niches in the adult bone marrow. HSPC niches
are located near the sinusoidal blood vessels, where the fenestrated endothelium is highly
permeable to nanoparticles and viral vectors. To this end, we propose that the HSPCs in the
bone marrow can be gene-edited by CRISPR/cas9 in situ. However, in vivo CRISPR/cas9 gene
editing can have substantial off-target effects due to the systemic dissemination of the delivery
vehicles and the non-specific activities of the cas9 nuclease. Recently, we developed a novel
gene-editing platform that combines the baculoviral vector with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP-
BV). Compared with conventional viral vectors, the baculoviral vector can transduce a broad
range of mammalian cells without replication. MNP-BV uses an external magnetic field and the
intrinsic complement system as the on- and off-switch for site-specific transgene delivery. In this
project, we will develop an MNP-BV-based gene-editing technique for precise gene editing of
HSPCs in the bone marrow. MNP-BV will be administrated via intraosseous infusion. We will
design a magnetic targeting method to enhance the retention of MNP-BV in the bone marrow
and the extravasation of MNP-BV to the perisinusoidal niches. Furthermore, the baculoviral
vector has a large DNA loading capacity (>38 kb) and thus can deliver inducible cas9 or gRNA
expression cassettes targeting specific cell populations. We will design gRNAs that can only be
activated by microRNAs (miRNAs) highly expressed in HSPCs. The central hypothesis is that
by combining intraosseous infusion, magnetic targeting, and miRNA-mediated posttranslational
regulation, the MNP-BV system can efficiently and precisely transduce HSPCs in the bone
marrow and correct hematological diseases-associated gene mutations. The success of this
project will pave the way for developing an effective and low-cost cure for a range of
hematological diseases."
10774337,"The overarching goal of the research in the Salz lab is to understand the regulatory logic and molecular
mechanisms underlying cell fate choice and commitment. As loss of cell fate leads to developmental disorders,
cancer, and infertility, a comprehensive understanding of the many different mechanisms used by cells to
establish and secure their chosen fate is essential. Our current work is focused on the female/male fate choice
in the Drosophila germline, where we have found that female germ cell identity depends on the permanent
repression of testes genes. This proposal builds on our exciting, published work showing that discrete gene-
specific blocks of repressive H3K9me3 chromatin silences key regulatory genes normally expressed in the male
germline. The repressive H3K9me3 histone modification is best known for its role in constitutive heterochromatin
formation and the repression of transposable elements, but recent work in organisms ranging from fission yeast
to humans (including our own) reveals that H3K9me3 peaks are also associated with the silencing of protein-
coding genes normally expressed in other tissues. Although these emerging studies identify H3K9me3-mediated
gene silencing as a conserved and vital strategy for securing cell fate, there is very little information about how
H3K9me3 is recruited to protein-coding genes. And there is no information about whether the mechanism
governing H3K9me3-mediated gene silencing in one tissue is generalizable to other tissues. These gaps limit
our understanding of H3K9me3's role in silencing lineage inappropriate genes in normal development and may
therefore impinge on our ability to diagnose and treat disease. The research proposed in this MIRA application
will build on our foundational work in the Drosophila germline to fill these gaps in knowledge. Using the powerful
genetic approaches and exciting modern technologies available in the fly, we expect our work in female germ
cells to accelerate the discovery of new genes and molecular mechanisms relevant to H3K9me3-medidated
gene silencing. Our new studies in the larval brain will extend these findings by determining whether somatic
cells use an analogous silencing mechanism. When complete, these studies will provide fundamental insights
into one of the least understood epigenetic mechanisms governing cell fate choice and commitment."
10764199,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Proper brain function requires that neurons make specific types of synapses with specific types of target neurons.
Defects in this process of synapse specficity can alter brain activity and may underlie many types of mental
illnesses but we know little about the mechanisms by which synapse specificity develops. We recently discovered
that the cell adhesion molecule Kirrel3 is selectively required to form a specific type of synapse that connects
DG neurons to GABA neurons in the hippocampus. This synapse provides feed-forward inhibition to CA3 and
Kirrel3 null mice have significantly elevated CA3 neuron activity. This established Kirrel3 as a functionally
relevant target-specific synaptogenic molecule but we still do not know the mechanism of Kirrel3 function.
Through a series of in vitro assays, our new preliminary data suggests that Kirrel3 binds other Kirrel3 molecules
in cis and trans, directs the assembly of pre- and post-synapses, and its function requires yet to be identified
neuronal molecules. Here, we will test the central hypothesis that homophilic, trans-cellular Kirrel3 interactions
nucleate DG-to-GABA synapses in vivo by recruiting synaptic proteins to axon-dendrite contact points. In Aim 1,
we will determine precisely where, when, and how much Kirrel3 is required to build hippocampal DG-to-GABA
synapses in vivo. In Aim 2, we will identify Kirrel3 signaling mechanisms by defining properties controlling the
differential subcellular localization of Kirrel3 isoforms and identifing Kirrel3 interacting proteins. Together, the
study of Kirrel3 provides a new approach to identify the still elusive mechanisms of target-specific synapse
formation and a framework for understanding how changes in synapse specificity impact hippocampal circuit
function, which plays a central role in learning and memory processes."

The high prevalence of food allergy (FA) places many at risk of severe reactions to foods including anaphylaxis
(1). Our studies on human subjects with FA and in relevant mouse models have identified changes in regulatory
T (Treg) cell populations as playing a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we have identified a
critical role of RORgt+ Treg cells, induced by the gut commensal bacteria, in mediating oral tolerance to food
allergens (2, 3). In contrast, FA is associated with defective microbiota-dependent differentiation of RORgt+ Treg
cells due to dysbiosis. We identified Resistin like molecule beta (RELMβ), a gut goblet cell cytokine previously
linked to the innate immune response to parasitic infections (4-6), as pivotal to FA pathogenesis by promoting
dysbiosis and disrupting RORgt+ Treg cell differentiation. Reciprocally, there emerges in FA food allergen-specific
Treg cells with a T helper cell type (Th2) cell like phenotype, with high expression of the transcription factor
GATA3 and the Th2 cytokines IL-4 (7, 8). These reprogrammed Treg cells play an essential role in amplifying
disease pathology, and they decline in patients receiving oral immunotherapy (7, 8). Our recent analysis of
circulating Treg cells of human subjects with FA identified Thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) as a
marker of their Th2 cell-like reprogramming. Accordingly, the focus of this proposal is to identify immune
regulatory checkpoints that govern FA and means of resetting them to promote oral tolerance. Our overall
hypothesis is that the evolution of FA entails two critical checkpoints each involving a distinct Treg cell population
under control of dedicated innate cell and cytokine circuits. The first involves microbiota-dependent Helios–
RORgt+ Treg cells generated at the peri-weaning period and thereafter which enforced oral tolerance. This circuit
is negatively controlled by RELMb, itself induced by an upstream Tuft cell (IL-25)-ILC2(IL-13) axis (9-11), which
predisposes to FA by promoting dysbiosis. The second involves Helios+TSLPR+ Th2 cell-like Treg cells that are
positively regulated by IgE/Mast cells and which augment the FA responses. To explore this hypothesis, we will
under Aim 1 examine the evolution of the pro-tolerogenic immune response in FA Il4raF709 mice following therapy
with anti-RELMb mAb or the acute deletion of the RELMb gene Retnlb. We will also elucidate the mechanisms
by which RELMb antagonism resets the gut microbiota to enforce oral tolerance, including the expansion of
Lactobacilli species rich in indole metabolites that act via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to suppress FA
by inducing RORgt+ Treg cells. Under Aim 2, we will dissect the role of TSLPR on Th2 cell-like reprogrammed
Treg cell in disease pathogenesis. These findings will then be extending to studies under Aim 3 on FA subjects
to relate changes in serum RELMb and Treg cell populations to dysbiosis and disease severity. The proposed
studies will provide fundamental new insights relevant to disease pathogenesis and novel therapeutic
approaches to re-establish oral tolerance in FA."

Social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) problems are among the most common chronic disabilities affecting
children growing up in urban and rural poverty. They also have implications for children’s school success as
they affect essential social-emotional learning skills such as the ability to comply with rules, follow instructions,
regulate emotions, and get along with others. These essential skills are first learned before kindergarten (K)
entry, in the context of a supportive, responsive, and consistent parenting relationship. To date, universal
school-based interventions to improve young children’s social-emotional learning have primarily targeted
students and teachers. Yet, parents are the central figures in young children’s lives and they need to be equal
partners with schools in promoting SEB skills. This study seeks to improve children’s SEB competence and K
readiness by strengthening parent engagement and parenting skills in early childhood education during
prekindergarten (PreK). This hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial will rigorously evaluate the
effects of an evidence-based parenting program, called the Chicago Parent Program (CPP), implemented in
PreK on K outcomes in urban and rural Title 1 schools in Maryland. Effectiveness Aims: Using a cluster
randomized design (N=30 schools, 840 families; >90% low-income), we will examine the effects of CPP
offered universally to Title 1 PreK parents on a) children’s SEB competence, parent engagement, and
parenting skills; and b) K readiness, chronic absence, and grade retention in K. We will also examine the
mechanisms underlying those effects. Schools will be stratified by rural vs urban district then randomized to
experimental (CPP) or control (usual practice) conditions. Data will be collected from multiple informants
(parents, teachers, CPP group leaders, school personnel, district administrative data). Implementation Aim:
Using the RE-AIM framework and a mixed methods approach, we will assess CPP reach, effectiveness,
acceptability, adoption, implementation, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability when offered in different formats
(virtual CPP groups vs in-person CPP groups) and contexts (urban vs rural schools). Schools will participate
for 2 years with experimental schools offering CPP twice, once in a virtual group format and once in an in-
person group format (format counterbalanced), giving us the ability to compare a range of outcomes
associated with uptake, acceptability, cost, and sustainability by CPP format in low-resource rural and urban
contexts. This study addresses the NICHD priority to test developmentally informed interventions designed to
ameliorate early adverse environmental effects on children and optimize their growth, development, and SEB
wellbeing. Children’s SEB health and school success are inextricably linked and both are adversely affected by
racial and economic inequities that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, heightening the
urgency of this research for supporting children, families, and schools."
10778564,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in order to meet elevated energy requirements to fuel
proliferation, thus resulting in their differential utilization of many essential metabolites compared to normal cells.
Recent advancements in the field of cancer metabolic reprogramming demonstrated significant increase in
efficiency of standard cancer treatments when combined with cancer metabolic inhibitors. However, tumor
metabolic reprogramming remains poorly understood for the majority of cancers. Moreover, many recent reports
revealed evidence that the metabolism of cancer cells in vitro can differ significantly from that of in vivo because
in vitro models lack complexity of the tumor microenvironment. However, the progress of studying tumor
metabolism in vivo is significantly hampered by the lack of efficient tools that allow real-time noninvasive imaging
and quantification of metabolite absorption in animal models of cancer which closely reflect human pathologies.
Current strategies have significant limitations and mostly rely on MRI, nuclear imaging techniques such as
PET/SPECT, and endpoint ex vivo quantification of metabolite absorption (ex. MS). Here, we propose to develop
a novel optical imaging platform that has several important advantages over the existing methods, and allows
noninvasive evaluation of the uptake of several essential metabolites using highly sensitive and quantifiable
bioluminescent imaging. The method is independent of radioactive and/or short-lived isotopes, less costly, and
allows longitudinal monitoring of metabolite absorption during disease progression (e.g., cancer development or
clinical intervention such as chemotherapy). While the first application of this approach has been already
successfully validated by us using glucose as an example (Maric et.al., Nat Methods, 2019), we propose to
expand this technology to develop novel probes to study uptake of several amino acids, fatty acids, and
nucleosides that all play central role in cancer metabolic reprogramming. We will perform thorough validation of
this platform in cells, healthy transgenic mice and murine animal cancer models to assure that the reagents fulfill
the requirements for physiological behavior, stability, safety, and robust signal generation both in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, we will optimize in vivo delivery routes, vehicles, and concentrations to achieve high
signal/background ratios. In summary, the overall goal of this study is to generate a novel optical imaging platform
that would become a universal analytical tool for monitoring nutrient uptake in live cells and animal models of
disease. While we plan to apply this platform to unravel tumor metabolic reprogramming, the same method could
be adapted for studies of several other important human pathologies, in which changes in metabolism are known
to play a significant role, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
and many others. Therefore, this novel technology is expected to have a strong, enabling, and long-lasting impact
on many physiological and pathological investigations in the field of metabolism and will become a valuable tool
for drug discovery, applicable to oncology and other metabolic disorders."

Quantification of drug-target engagement is recognized as the most crucial parameter in the drug development
pipeline as it is central to therapeutic action. Though, such parameter can only be assessed via invasive
biochemical and immunohistochemical (IHC) approaches in ex vivo tissues. Herein, we propose to integrate and
optimize a multimodal optical imaging platform that can provide direct longitudinal (multiple time points)
measurements of the drug-target engagement distribution across the same tissue volume in correlation with drug
delivery efficacy parameters, including, tumor vasculature, and indicators of drug response, such as metabolism.
The imaging platform will be validated in human breast tumor and patient derived xenografts in live animals
subjected to HER2-trastuzumab therapy. Additionally, as MFMT is an indirect image formation technique relying
on complex computational tasks, we will further pioneer the use of Deep Learning methodologies for fast,
accurate, parameter-free and user friendly 2D and 3D MFMT image formation."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) reaches peak levels during young adulthood, making it critical that we understand person-specific alcohol risk profiles in young adults to prevent AUD or intervene before this disorder becomes chronic. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism’s (NIAAA) neurobiological framework, the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA), offers an innovative approach for understanding AUD in this population. The ANA posits that individual differences in 3 neurofunctional domains can help differentiate the substantial clinical heterogeneity in AUD. The ANA builds upon the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a dimensional framework for investigating mental disorders in terms of varying degrees of dysfunction in 6 core biological/psychological systems. As a starting point, NIAAA endorsed an initial 3-domain ANA model, which aligns with most RDoC systems. Two RDoC systems, not in the initial ANA, include sleep/circadian and social processes and are highly relevant to young adult alcohol risk. The 3-domain ANA model has been validated in research with adults and predicts treatment outcomes, including work by our team. It has yet to be investigated in young adults. We propose to study the ANA model, expanded to include sleep/circadian and social processes, in young adults (non-college/college, ages 18-25) (N=350), who report recent moderate to heavy drinking. Specifically, young adults will participate in a 12-month longitudinal study, which involves completing self-report questionnaires, neuropsychological tasks, and engaging in passive and active smartphone data collection. These assessments include recommended/similar ANA measures, RDoC-relevant sleep/circadian and social measures, and novel smartphone measures to improve ANA scalability. Smartphone data collection is rigorous, unobtrusive, scalable, and highly relevant for young adults given their extensive smartphone use. Smartphones can generate rich moment-by-moment neurobehavioral data (e.g., mobility, sociality) passively through embedded sensors and phone usage logs and actively through survey prompts. These digital behavioral indicators show promise for predicting psychiatric disorder symptoms, course, treatment response, and functional brain activity. We will use data from study participants to achieve the following aims: For Aim 1, we will validate an ANA model for young adults (ANA-YA) using baseline self-report and neuropsychological measures related to the 3 ANA domains and RDoC sleep/circadian and social processes. We will then examine baseline associations between the ANA-YA model and baseline drinking measures. We will also explore longitudinal change in ANA-YA phenotypes and test whether these changes predict 12-month alcohol outcomes. For Aim 2, we will examine the baseline associations of smartphone data to ANA-YA domains and then examine longitudinal change in smartphone data and whether these changes predict 12-month ANA-YA phenotypes. Our results will advance the science of young adult AUD neurobiology and identify efficient, valid assessments for distinguishing alcohol risk in this group."

Project Summary
Any clinician treating a patient with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) would like to know whether this patient would
relapse in the next week or month. Such a score, analogous to a credit score in consumer finance, may be
similarly obtained from longitudinal data streams derived from patient behavior during SUD treatment. There
are several common data sources that every OUD patient in treatment produces: a binary, longitudinal data
survey of use patterns for a set of pre-determined substances of abuse, treatment session attendance records,
and medication records. In particular, urine drug screens (UDS) or alcohol and nicotine breathalyzers and
standard Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) questionnaires are universal surveys in every treatment delivery
context, including large pragmatic clinical trials. While these data streams are incomplete, of different lengths
and sampling frequencies, and correlate in complex ways, contemporary machine learning methods allow us to
overcome these challenges. We aim to build a toolbox that would allow for the following: 1) standardized
methods for risk scoring and visualization from UDS and TLFB datasets in existing large clinical trials; 2)
standard methods for inferences of risk scores: procedure for hypothesis testing whether an intervention made
a difference in the risk scores and their trajectories. 3) user-friendly software modules aimed toward
researchers and administrators for quality improvement projects and customized predictive modeling pipelines,
and interpretable web portal for clinicians, analogous to a credit report. This proposal will also incorporate
usability survey and evaluation for algorithmic bias. These applications will provide a computational framework
for future real time predictive modeling work for many other different substance use disorders."

Melanoma immunotherapy with GPR182 blockade
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has greatly improved survival of patients with late-stage melanoma.
However, over half of patients do not benefit from this therapy. One of the main hurdles is that many melanoma
tissues lack effector CD8+ T cell infiltrates. Chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 play an important role in
regulating effector T cell infiltration into the tumors. Atypical Chemokine Receptors are a group of GPCR proteins
that are expressed in non-immune cells to actively regulate chemokines by endocytosis. Our studies uncovered
GPR182
as
a novel ACKR receptor selectively upregulated in peritumoral lymphatics. Our preliminary results
indicated that genetic deletion of this molecule in mice led to increased effector T cell infiltration and thereby the
retardment of tumor growth in several mouse melanoma models. We further found that GPR182 interacts with
chemokines broadly in vitro and blockade of CXCR3 completely abolished improved antitumor immunity in
GPR182- deficient mice. Here we hypothesize that GPR182 inhibits anti-tumor immune response by limiting
chemokine availability and targeting this pathway offers a novel approach to converting immunologically cold
melanoma to hot ones. We will dissect the molecular interaction between GPR182 and chemokines, and also
examine the chemokine endocytosis by GPR182 with tumors. The mechanisms by which GPR182 inhibits
antitumor T cell response will be investigated. Finally, the in vivo antitumor effect of a GPR182 monoclonal
antibody, which blocks the interaction between GPR182 and chemokines, will be assessed. By the completion
of these studies, we will identify a new strategy of inflaming immunologically cold melanoma and will have a
better understanding of the immunomodulatory role of the lymphatics in melanoma."

10875365,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pharmacogenomics has the potential to dramatically improve health care outcomes, but is currently failing on
diversity among its research participants. As a consequence, we do not fully understand all of the factors
influencing pharmacogical response in underrepresented populations, including those that contribute to
racial/ethnic differences in drug efficacy and safety as reported by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug
labels. For example, the clinical validity of genetic variants that are common in research participants from
historically-excluded populations (e.g., lower proportions of European genetic ancestry), but rare in
wellrepresented study populations remains unknown. In addition, gene expression studies have already provided
insight into the underlying biology of disease susceptibility for numerous conditions beyond what genome wide
association study (GWAS) results alone have discovered, but have not been fully applied to studies of
pharmacogenomic discovery. Furthermore, social determinants of health may impact pharmacological drug
response from a biological standpoint even after taking into account the effects of these factors on drug
adherence, access, and utilization (e.g. social determinants of epigenetics). Addressing this gap in knowledge
has the potential to prevent future healthcare disparities that may be exacerbated as the infrastructure to support
clinical pharmacogenomics continues to gain traction across health institutions nationwide. Furthermore,
elucidation of the genetic and nongenetic contributors to differences in drug response across race/ethnicity will
obviate the use of this population descriptor as a proxy for these factors. Pharmacogenomic studies using large,
diverse datasets are necessary to ensure that advances in this field benefit individuals equitably.
Our primary goal in this project is to identify genetic and social determinants of pharmacological drug response
among racial/ethnic minorities. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage data from the Kaiser Permanente
Research Biobank (KPRB) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All Of Us research program, which are two
of the largest electronic health record-linked biobanks in the United States. These cohorts are ideal for the
proposed studies because they are large (>400,000 participants each), diverse (>25% racial/ethnic minorities),
linked to genome-wide genetic data, and capture social determinants of health.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the relative contribution of genetic ancestry versus social factors on race/ethnicity-
based differences in drug efficacy and safety. In Aim 2, we will identify genome-wide polymorphisms predictive
of drug effects in historically-excluded populations from large pharmacogenetics studies. In Aim 3, we will use
ancestry-specific gene expression results to identify genetic determinants of drug response. The aims will be
carried out by an established multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical pharmacology, cardiovascular
epidemiology, and molecular genetics. These findings from the current study will help to inform clinical decisions
impacting communities historically-excluded from biomedical research."
10775762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers unique mechanisms of cell death and is used to treat many cancers in the
clinic. The principal of phototherapy is that photoactive chemicals delivered to the disease site convert incident
photonic energy into local chemical toxicity, avoiding a systemic shock. PDT is agnostic to classical drug-
resistance pathways and does not cause critical co-morbidities, making it attractive as a monotherapy or as a
component of multi-modal therapy. However, a major criticism of PDT is the need for an external light source,
which limits the application of PDT to superficial lesions or those accessible by fiber optics. To overcome this,
a paradigm shift in the mechanism of light delivery for PDT has recently emerged: bioluminescence (BL)
mediated PDT (BL-PDT), wherein BL enzymes activate spectrally matched, co-localized photosensitizers (PS)
within the lesion, eliminating the need for an external light source. Although this overcomes a major hurdle,
current methods that leverage semiconductor nanoconstructs for BL enzyme delivery are limited in their ability
to localize to the disease. Here, we propose a novel method for BL enzyme delivery and BL-PDT: to
genetically engineer ultra-bright bioluminescent immune cells (UBLIs) and exploit their disease-homing
capabilities, like chemotaxis, to traffic to and accumulate in sites of disease. This approach eliminates the need
for complex and potentially toxic nanoconstructs as a component of drug delivery—only the BL substrate and
PS administration (both non-toxic compounds) will be required. Recently, we introduced precision
photomedicine using a targeted, activatable PS that exhibited cellular selectivity and reduced off-target toxicity
in a metastatic cancer model. We will pair the proposed novel light delivery platform with precision
photomedicine for maximal benefit. First, we will optimize the BL-PDT platform in 3D cancer–immune cell co-
cultures across biologically and clinically relevant parameter spaces informed by Monte Carlo simulations.
Then we will demonstrate the approach in vivo by intravenous injection of UBLIs into an in vivo xenograft
model of cancer metastases informed by in vitro results. These proof-of-concept studies will enable
comprehensive safety and efficacy studies in multiple disease models in future funding periods. Ultimately, we
envision clinical translation involving extraction and engineering of patient immune cells, similar to chimeric
antigen redirected (CAR) T cell therapy, followed by reinfusion and administration of photomedicine. This new
therapeutic paradigm has potential to benefit many diseases in cancer and beyond, which justifies the high-
risk, high-reward nature of the proposal."
10738299,"Discovered in 2017, Colletotrichum camelliae filamentous virus 1 (CcFV-1) is considered an outlier
among dsRNA viruses due to its filamentous morphology. Typical dsRNA viruses possess a spherically shaped
icosahedral capsid with multiple copies of a viral polymerase complex packaged inside for in situ transcription of
the viral genome. These dsRNA viruses do not completely uncoat during host entry, allowing transcription of the
viral genome to take place within intact capsids while avoiding dsRNA activated defense mechanisms of their
hosts. In contrast, CcFV-1 particles assume the shape of a flexuous filament with a 12.2 kb genome that is
organized into eight gene segments with ten predicted open reading frames (ORFs) including P1, an RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP); P3, a putative S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase;
P4, the capsid protein (CP); and seven other proteins of yet unknown functions.
The overarching goals of this grant are to determine how CcFV-1 organizes its genomic dsRNA inside
the viral particle, whether CcFV-1 has virion-associated transcription activity and, if so, how the filamentous
CcFV-1 capsid provides polymerase access to the dsRNA genome without complete uncoating and disassembly.
We have already demonstrated that recombinant CcFV-1 CP forms both helical VLPs and small oligomers.
Recombinant P1 RdRP forms stable dimers and we have obtained a preliminary cryo-electron microscopy
reconstruction of P1 showing a S-shaped molecule. CcFV-1 P1 and P3 form a stable complex that is also suitable
for cryo-EM analysis. In addition, we will have access to infectious CcFV-1 virion samples provided by Dr.
Wenxing Xu at the Huazhong Agricultural University in China. Altogether, these data not only provide a strong
rationale, but also demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed experiments. Our research plan consists of three
independent but complementary aims. Aim 1 is to elucidate the structural organization of the CcFV-1 viral
particle by solving the structure of both the filamentous VLP and infectious virion. We hypothesize that
the helical capsid of CcFV-1 protects its dsRNA genome from triggering cellular antiviral responses during all
stages of viral replication. Aim 2 is to determine the structural and biochemical properties of the CcFV-1
polymerase complex. The central hypothesis is that CcFV-1 polymerase complex should possess RdRP,
methyltransferase, and guanylyltransferase activities with possibly unique structural features that allow it to
transcribe dsRNA packaged in a helical capsid. Aim 3 is explore interactions between the CcFV-1 capsid
and the polymerase complex. We will analyze the RNA transcription activity of infectious viral particles and
investigate the mechanism of polymerase incorporation into infectious virions. We hypothesize that the CcFV-1
polymerase complex is likely localized to the terminal ends of the viral helical capsid through direct protein-
protein and/or protein-RNA interactions. Results from our research will lead to new paradigms that apply to
CcFV-1 and other filamentous dsRNA viruses."

The aging brain undergoes fluctuations in neurotransmitters and gene expression, volumetric atrophy, cellular
senescence, vascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Age also is a risk factor for
developing neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). The current
primary therapies for AD and PD target transmission of neurotransmitters acetylcholine and dopamine, and
neurotransmitter deficiencies are associated with cognitive and motor impairments. Thus, investigating species
differences in neurotransmitters is vital to developing effective models of age-related neurological disorders.
Nonhuman primates, particularly chimpanzees, are an invaluable resource for aging studies. Like humans, older
apes experience mild decline in memory, executive function, and cognitive flexibility, and their brains bear
remarkable similarities to elderly humans in gene expression, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and
neuroinflammation. Chimpanzees also exhibit the AD hallmarks of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles in the absence of significant neuronal loss or dementia symptoms. One possibility for the lack of severe
cognitive decline in chimpanzees, despite the presence of AD lesions, may be species-specific alterations in
neurotransmitters. While prior studies report mild age-related cholinergic and dopaminergic reductions in aged
macaque brains, the effect of aging and AD pathology on neurotransmitters in chimpanzees remains unknown.
To address this issue, we will investigate neurotransmitter gene expression and protein levels in the chimpanzee
brain for age-, sex- and AD pathology-related changes as observed in humans. Utilizing immunohistochemistry,
unbiased stereology, and postmortem brain samples from adult and aged chimpanzees previously identified with
AD pathology, we will measure neurotransmitter neuron or axon length densities for: dopamine in the dorsal
striatum and midbrain; acetylcholine in the dorsal striatum, basal forebrain, and pons; serotonin in the raphe
nucleus; and norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus. We also will examine expression of genes involved in the
transmission and metabolism of neurotransmitters using bulk RNA sequencing and frozen brain specimens from
young and aged chimpanzees with and without AD pathology. To determine if modifications in neurotransmitters
correlate with behavioral changes, we will use archival behavioral data. In addition, we will assess longitudinal
changes in cognitive functions using an automated touchscreen testing system, motor skill on a tool use task,
walking speed, and agonistic and affiliative social interactions in a cohort of living chimpanzees. Distinguishing
if species differences in neurotransmitter systems are associated with age-related behavioral changes is
essential for improving current models of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, and this proposal will fill
a critical gap in our evolutionary knowledge of the influence of aging and AD neuropathology on
neurotransmitters in chimpanzees, our closest living ancestor."

Recent data show alarming increases in suicide mortality among Black youth combined with concerning
disparities in access to and engagement in outpatient mental health care. Despite this urgent need, there are
no well-established psychosocial treatments for suicide risk with demonstrated effectiveness in Black youth.
Commonly used approaches (e.g., CBT) tend to focus on intrapersonal factors associated with suicide-related
distress, such as cognitive distortions and emotion dysregulation, with limited focus on interpersonal factors
(e.g., connectedness, social support), which are recommended as a suicide prevention strategy, and may be
specifically protective for Black youth. The Youth Nominated Support Team (YST) was designed to be
adjunctive to treatment following an acute suicide crisis, is specifically focused on intrapersonal connections,
and has been designated a “promising intervention” by SAMHSA. YST creates a team of youth- nominated
adults who receive education and guidance, provide weekly supportive contacts for high-risk youth, and
encourage youth participation in treatment. YST is the only individual-level suicide prevention strategy in the
U.S. with evidence of association with reduced self-injury mortality; participation in YST is also linked to
increased treatment utilization. In response to this urgent need and RFA-MH-22-125, the proposed project will
use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) strategy to iteratively develop and pilot test a two-
component psychosocial intervention, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Suicide Prevention plus the Youth-
Nominated Support Team (CBT-SP+YST) for adolescents, ages 12-17 years, following an ED visit for acute
suicide risk. Given the paucity of intervention development research conducted with Black youth, the alarming
increases in suicide mortality among Black youth, and the possibility that social support interventions may be
particularly protective for Black youth, this initial development of CBT-SP+YST will focus on cultural tailoring for
Black youth served by Detroit/Wayne County’s public mental health system. Embedded within a hybrid one
effectiveness-implementation framework, we will 1) integrate an innovative scalable computer assisted version
of YST (E-YST) with CBT-SP, tailoring intervention components based on input from community stakeholders,
2) conduct a feasibility pilot and 3) conduct a pilot RCT to examine theorized mechanisms of action, youth
outcomes, intervention feasibility/acceptability, and barriers to implementation in this population of publicly
insured Black youth. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards a larger-scale effectiveness
trial, which will be facilitated by the innovative computer-assisted E -YST platform. The integration and
tailoring of these two strategies has the potential to address an urgent public health concern while capitalizing
on the inherent strengths found in the families, schools, and community institutions that surround Black youth."
10748416,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress is theorized to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and progression. In animal
models, stress hormones can induce states similar to those seen in AD, such as impaired glucose metabolism,
inflammation of the brain, and increased -amyloid (A) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain.
Unfortunately, the effect of stress on AD pathogenesis in humans is more difficult to establish. Currently, the
relationship between stress and AD in humans is limited to correlational studies. For instance, individuals with
mild cognitive impairment and AD have higher stress hormone (cortisol) levels throughout the day and do not
efficiently shut down the stress response. Other work suggests that greater stress system dysfunction is
associated with more rapid disease progression. Still other research suggests that veterans with a history of
post-traumatic stress disorder had a two-fold increase in AD development, while a series of studies in women
suggests that stress in midlife is related to an increased risk of AD diagnosis later in life. These studies suggest
there is a long-term and possibly cumulative effect of stress exposure on later AD outcomes, however, these
observational studies do not sufficiently address potential mechanisms connecting stress exposure to AD risk.
In particular, we lack information about whether stressors influence A levels in humans. This proposal targets
this gap by asking, “does acute stress increase A levels in humans?” We will achieve this by measuring the
plasma A response to an acute laboratory stressor, the socially evaluated cold pressor test. Thirty-eight
women and men aged 18-65 will complete a laboratory stressor involving holding their hand in ice water for an
amount of time unknown to the participant while their reactions to the stressor are videotaped. Participants will
also complete a non-stressful task in lieu of the stressor in a separate session. At both sessions, stress
activation will be measured using changes in salivary free cortisol levels and in heart rate variability, and blood
samples will be collected for measuring the A response to stress. We predict that cortisol and plasma A
levels will increase, and heart rate variability will decrease, during the stress session but not during the control
session. We further predict that the magnitude of change in salivary free cortisol and heart rate variability in
response to stress will be related to the magnitude of change of plasma A in response to stress.
Understanding how stress may trigger AD-related processes is an important step in understanding how stress
contributes to AD development and progression in people. This proposal will address this important gap in the
stress-AD literature by translating the effects of acute stress on A production observed in animal models to
humans. Findings from this study will help develop a mechanistic pathway for how repeated or cumulative
stress increases AD risk and pathogenesis later in life and drive future avenues of research in AD development
and AD treatment options, especially during the prodromal stage of the disease when decreasing stress-
related A production might protect against AD-pathogenesis and progression."

LGR5, a marker of adult and fetal stem cells in various tissues and organs, has been studied extensively for the
past decades. Cells expressing LGR5 play key roles in organ/tissue development, homeostasis, regeneration,
and disease, including cancer. Therefore, having the ability to identify, track, and manipulate these cells in vitro
and in vivo, will allow their detailed role in normal and pathological organ function. To date, most of the research
on LGR5 cells has been performed using mice, which have significant anatomical, physiological, and molecular
differences from the human. Utilizing a newly developed LGR5-H2B-GFP pig line we have demonstrated its wide
utility for studying the role of these unique cells and have now made seminal observations in a variety of
tissues/organs. However, we have also been unable to address some key aspects due to the inability of the
existing model to analyze the differentiated progeny (lineage tracking) of LGR5 cells during development, after
transplantation, or during the process of injury and repair. In addition, while we have been able to inactivate both
alleles of the LGR5 gene, we do not have the ability to delete the cell itself. Being able to delete the LGR5
expressing cell will increase our understanding of the importance of this unique cell (versus the LGR5 gene itself)
in the phenotypes of interest. Thus, to overcome these two deficiencies, and further increase the value and
impact of the original LGR5-H2B-GFP animal model, we propose to develop a highly improved LGR5 pig line
that will allow labeling of the LGR5 cell, tracking of its progeny after injury, and delete it when desired. The high
concordance between human and pig results to date with respect to LGR5 expression and function, not only
increases the value of this line for basic research, but also for rapidly translating clinical findings to humans,
further increasing the impact of this unique animal model. Successful completion of the proposed aims will
generate a powerful animal model for study of translational aspects of LGR5 stem cells of the gut, lung, skin,
liver, cochlea, and kidney among others."

Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and worldwide. The most common types of lung
cancer are non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC, 84%) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC, 13%). NSCLC
includes two major histological subtypes, adenocarcinoma (AC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). All
subtypes of lung cancer are thought to arise from airway epithelial cells damaged by genotoxic exposure, which
most commonly include tobacco smoke and radon radiation. These damaged cells frequently acquire early driver
mutations in the KRAS gene that could be also present in advanced lung cancers. However, even in the cases
with significant and chronic exposure (such as in heavy smokers), not all damaged cells give rise to cancer, and
the mechanisms that prevent the progression of early premalignant lesions to cancer are still not fully understood.
Studies using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) highlighted the roles of cell cycle arrest and
senescence, mediated by retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins and p53, in protection from lung tumorigenesis.
However, further research is required to better understand the barriers to lung carcinogenesis at the molecular
level, and to develop accurate models representing early stages of lung cancer pathogenesis.
 Previously, we characterized a transcriptional repressor complex called DREAM that assembles in G0/G1
when Rb-like protein p130 recruits E2F4, DP1, and a stable core of five proteins including LIN9, LIN37, LIN52,
LIN54, and RBBP4. The DREAM binds to promoters and mediates the repression of >800 cell cycle genes,
including most genes required for DNA damage response and repair. Phosphorylation of serine-28 residue in
LIN52 by DYRK1A kinase is required for the DREAM assembly. DREAM-DYRK1A pathway could be relevant to
cancer because either inhibition of DYRK1A, or S28A-LIN52 mutation result in bypass of the oncogenic Ras-
induced senescence in the immortalized human and mouse cell lines. The KRAS gene is mutated in 15% - 30%
of NSCLC cases, and its driver role in lung cancer is strongly supported by encouraging NSCLC clinical data
using KRASG12C-targeted therapeutics. However, the pathophysiological significance of the DREAM disruption
in lung cancer is not known, and the mechanisms of senescence bypass in the cells lacking DREAM are not well
understood. Here, we test our hypothesis that DREAM complex contributes to tumor prevention by
suppressing DNA repair in the damaged cells during early stages of lung cancer pathogenesis.
Previously, the role of DREAM in lung cancer could not be directly investigated due to a lack of suitable mouse
models. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a DREAM-less mouse homozygous for S28A mutation
in the Lin52 gene, using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. We will use our novel Lin52S28A mouse model to investigate
the role of the DYRK1A-DREAM pathway during the early steps of lung cancer pathogenesis driven by genotoxic
stress or KrasG12C mutation."

Photoreceptor loss due to degenerative retinopathy is a leading cause of adult vision loss. Transplantation of
photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) into adult retina is an exciting strategy for replacing lost photoreceptors
and restoring vision in mice. However, a major obstacle to advancement of this approach is extremely limited
migration of transplanted cells through the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) and into the retina. Our laboratory
has discovered, that PPCs express a number of migratory receptors which guide migration to retinal ligands in
vitro. We hypothesize that receptor-driven, haptotactic and chemotactic mechanisms can be exploited to
optimize PPC migration through the IPM and into the retina. Our first goal in this project is to characterize PPC
haptotaxis to bound IPM ligands and chemotaxis to soluble retinal ligands using our established bioinformatics
database and microfluidics platform. We will characterize chemotaxis driven by the top three expressed PPC
receptors to their corresponding soluble retinal ligands, KDR-VEGF, PDGFR-PDGF, and RET-GDNF,
receptors-ligands respectively. And we will analyze haptotaxis driven by the top two haptotactic PPC receptors
ITGAM and ITGB1 to IPM ligands chondroitin sulfate and fibronectin. Next, we will examine the extent to which
modulation of haptotactic and chemotactic receptors will increase migration in vitro and in a rhodopsin
knockout, degenerative retinopathy retina model ex vivo. Lastly, we will analyze receptor protein levels of
PPCs migrated into the IPM and retina to validate our current data and define novel mechanisms of PPC
migration. The combined cross-disciplinary approach will provide data to move PPC transplantation forward for
the restoration of vision."
10812363,"ABSTRACT: Quality of Alcohol-related Care Received: Missed Opportunities, Disparities and Impacts
 of Health Reform
Nearly 20 years ago it was estimated that Americans with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive recommended
care only 10% of the time. This was a striking, wake-up call to alcohol services providers and policymakers given
the tremendous impact of unchecked harmful drinking in the US. Excessive drinking is a leading cause of
preventable death among Americans, with 1 of every 4 US adults exceeding NIAAA's recommended drinking
limits. Moreover, there are disparities in on-going heavy drinking beyond young adulthood, in later onset,
persistence and recurrence of AUD, and in alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. The pressing need to address
unhealthy drinking has motivated alcohol screening and brief intervention (ASBI) in primary care, and recognition
of the chronic, relapsing nature of AUD has focused attention on treatment engagement, retention, and
completion and the promise of alcohol pharmacotherapy. Yet new research suggests that the quality of ASBI
falls far short of clinical guidelines, and that there may be disparities in access to pharmacotherapy. Now, more
than ever, healthcare quality and disparities are key issues for US healthcare providers and
policymakers, and targeted by health reform initiatives to improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs.
This Continuing Center Project aims to shed light on these issues by using national survey and administrative
data to investigate alcohol-related care quality and disparities across the alcohol services system, from
prevention to treatment. Study Aims are to: 1) Assess the magnitude and severity of missed opportunities for
providing appropriate ASBI for unhealthy drinking and AUD; 2) Examine receipt of pharmacotherapy for AUD;
and 3) Assess the effects of health reform on the receipt of appropriate ASBI, completion of alcohol treatment,
and integrated care (receipt of specialty treatment and general health care by persons with AUD and especially
health comorbidities). This population-based study will leverage our team's distinctive expertise studying drinking
patterns, alcohol problems, alcohol services utilization and related disparities using national data sets; apply
traditional analytic and quasi-experimental techniques as well as cutting-edge causal inference methods; and
employ an integrative conceptual framework to highlight how inequities in care can add up across the alcohol
services system. By defining the need for care based on alcohol and health comorbidities, this study will highlight
the health implications of failing to provide quality care for unhealthy drinking and AUD. Findings can help to
stimulate efforts by clinicians, healthcare administrators, treatment providers and policymakers to increase and
improve alcohol-related care and equitable access."

10812367,"ABSTRACT: High-Intensity Drinking over the Life Course: Identifying high-risk subgroups through
 event-based and population-based approaches
Binge or heavy episodic drinking (HED) of ≥4/ ≥5 drinks for women/men in a single occasion or day has been a
key marker of harmful drinking in general and clinical populations and has been widely used in alcohol
epidemiology to capture the public health burden from alcohol use. Yet critics have raised the issue that the HED
threshold fails to capture the impact of high-intensity drinking (HID) and implies the same average risks to all
heavy drinkers regardless of whether they consume 5 or 15 drinks. Recent studies have raised attention to HID
of consuming double (8+/10+ drinks) or even triple (12+/15+ drinks) the HED amount. As amounts per day reach
extreme levels, risks for consequences and alcohol use disorders (AUD) increase greatly, even when average
intake remains the same. This proposed Center project will trace trends in harmful drinking patterns with special
attention to HID occurrence and rates over a 40-year period, identify a range of alcohol-related precursors and
problems through event-based and population-based approaches, and situate harmful patterns within contexts
to inform early screening and interventions for high-risk groups. We will employ sophisticated statistical
methods to examine associations and consequences involved with HED and HID, using two adult general
population and two heavy drinker event-based samples, each type of data designed to generate
complementary and new knowledge about HID. We carry forward ARG's rich history in alcohol epidemiology
and measurement expertise, and the Center mission to reduce alcohol-related disparities, in all our study aims.
In response to NIAAA's priorities, and to ensure direct translational impact of study findings, we incorporate
specific theory and practice for each study aim. Our definitions of HED/HID include both threshold (5+, 8+ and
12+) and amounts drunk in any day (from 5-7, 8-11, and 12+ drinks). Aim 1 takes a life course perspective to
document harmful drinking trends over time from 1984 to 2024 and by priority groups (e.g., women; middle-aged
to older adults; socially disadvantaged groups including racial/ethnic minorities and those with lower education;
and people with history of AUD treatment or in recovery). Aim 2 characterizes event-level factors that heighten
the risks for HID compared to HED levels. Sensitivity analyses will compare whether adjustments for drink
size/strength and drinking rate (estimated BAC) will improve accuracy of how HID predict alcohol problems (e.g.,
AUD). Aim 3 situates harmful drinking patterns involving HID within the socioecological model to examine risk
and protective factors both currently and across the life course that are strongly associated with HID. Also in Aim
3 we assess the extent that HID elevates the public health burden of AUD and other problems above that of
HED and non-HED levels for all drinkers and priority groups using risk models and machine learning methods.
Study findings will help identify key population subgroups and risk/protective factors that can support future
development of targeted interventions at the event, individual, and environmental levels to reduce heavy and
high-intensity drinking and their associated consequences."

Center. Continuing from the 2016-2020 Center, the current SDS Core consists of three biostatisticians with
varying areas of expertise in cutting-edge methods, including causal inference approaches like doubly robust
models, Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and instrumental variable methods; machine-learning models
like SuperLearner and segmentation analyses; traditional epidemiologic and econometric methods like age-
period-cohort and multi-level analyses; and innovative weighting methods for survey data. All projects (National
Alcohol Survey; Health Disparities; Alcohol Services; High-Intensity Drinking) depend on the SDS Core for
biostatistical services in order to meet their specific aims. The SDS Core proposes to support the Center's goals
in the following three ways. First, the SDS Core will provide state-of-the-art biostatistical and analysis support
services to each of the Center's research projects. This support will be provided throughout the entire research
process including hypothesis generation, survey design and monitoring of sampling progress, database
development, analysis formulation and implementation, and research manuscript preparation. Second, a
continuing training aim will further the goal of increasing the methodological sophistication of Center researchers
through a series of courses on motivation, theory, implementation, and inferential interpretation of a wide range
of cutting-edge methods. As part of this training, Center researchers will also learn several key statistical
packages in hands-on workshops. These courses have been ongoing as part of the current and previously
funded Centers, and have been extremely valuable in raising the overall level of technical functioning of ARG
researchers in the continually evolving field. The third and final aim is to provide a range of database and
dissemination, including maintenance of and oversight for using the secure data repository, and support services
for disseminating results from Center-related projects, with the exciting addition of a new data visualization
module. The SDS Core is uniquely positioned to drive innovation because it provides integral services necessary
for projects to implement cutting-edge methods for addressing key questions in substance use and health
disparities research, while also drawing on its decades of experience with traditional epidemiologic approaches.
A formal SDS Core offers the correct balance of expert consulting and analysis resources, and a system of
biostatistical theory and practical implementation training courses to create an atmosphere where researchers

certified medical microbiologist (Burd) and an epidemiologist (Tunali) with expertise vast areas of antibiotic
resistance. For Core B to enable successful completion of the research projects and advance our understanding
of antibiotic HR we propose three specific aims. 1) To provide access to clinical bacterial isolate. Isolates
(Enterobacterales and Acinetobacter baumanii complex) will be collected as part of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC) Georgia Emerging Infections Program (EIP) Multi-site Gram-negative
Surveillance Initiative (MuGSI), Emory University's Investigational Clinical Microbiology Core (ICMC)
biorepository, and Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. 2) To profile clinical bacterial isolates for HR. We will
test 500 bacterial isolates per year from bloodstream, urine, and respiratory clinical infections: 200 multi-drug
resistant organisms (MDRO) from the Georgia EIP; 100 non-MDRO from the ICMC and 200 predominately
susceptible isolates from Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. Each isolate will be tested for HR to
approximately 20 antibiotics using population analysis profiling (PAP), the gold standard for HR. 3) To perform
epidemiological analyses revealing the prevalence, type and trends of HR. We will establish the prevalence of
HR from the 2500 isolates tested in aim 2. We will perform comprehensive descriptive epidemiology on the
clinical and laboratory characteristics of isolates with HR and compare those to isolates without HR. Core B will
be conducted in the laboratories of the Georgia EIP and Emory University's ICMC, which have extensive
expertise in active-population based surveillance and studies of HR. The Core leadership will work closely with
the HR-IRU program directors/PIs and project leaders to ensure that the needs of all projects are rigorously met
in a reliable, reproducible and timely manner."

Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is critical to designing novel approaches and therapeutics to
combat resistant bacteria. Heteroresistance (HR) is a bacterial phenotype in which an isolate contains a
subpopulation of cells that show a substantial increase in antibiotic resistance compared to the main population.
Many species of bacteria and nearly all classes of antibiotics exhibit this form of phenotypic resistance and there
is evidence from in vitro experiments, mathematical modeling, animal infection models and clinical studies that
the resistant subpopulations can enrich during antibiotic exposure and lead to treatment failure. Recent studies
show that the resistance phenotype in HR is in the majority of cases unstable and in the absence of antibiotic
pressure it rapidly reverts to susceptibility. One major reason for the instability is the occurrence of genetically
unstable tandem gene amplifications of different types of genes that can cause resistance when present at an
increased copy number (e.g., bona fide resistance genes that are normally expressed at low levels, efflux
pumps). Due to the instability, low frequency and transient character, it is challenging to detect and study these
subpopulations and in a clinical microbiology setting this often leads to difficulties in unambiguously classifying
bacteria as susceptible or resistant, which can lead to potential treatment failures. To facilitate the improved
treatment and detection of HR infections, we need to understand in detail the underlying mechanisms and
dynamics by which the resistant sub-populations form, are maintained and recede back to their baseline
frequency in the absence of antibiotic. Specifically, we will ask: what are the key genetic, physiological and
environmental processes and signals that govern the generation of resistant sub-populations and subsequently,
if and how we may modify and interfere with them. To address these questions, we will use clinical isolates of
Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp) and A. baumannii.
At a basic level, this work will significantly broaden our understanding of (i) how traits exhibited by a
subpopulation of cells is generated and can influence behavior and evolution of bacterial populations, (ii) how
HR is generated by CNV, (iii) the mechanisms and dynamics of CNV and (iv) how HR may be predicted from
whole genome sequencing data. This will, in the long-term, provide us with better tools to identify HR and mitigate
its effects in clinical settings and, thereby, improve antibiotic treatment outcome."
10799604,"ABSTRACT
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious medical challenges of our time. This crisis puts patients at risk
of untreatable bacterial infections and threatens major advances of modern medicine that rely on antibiotics
(transplants, chemotherapy, etc). There are at least 2.8 million antibiotic resistant infections each year in the
US, leading to over 35,000 deaths [1]. Without significant action, worldwide annual mortality due to these
infections is predicted to reach 10 million by 2050, surpassing that predicted for cancer [2]. Understanding
resistance mechanisms is critical to designing novel approaches and therapeutics to combat resistant bacteria.
Heteroresistance (HR) is an enigmatic form of antibiotic resistance in which a bacterial isolate harbors a
resistant subpopulation that can rapidly replicate in the presence of an antibiotic, while a susceptible
subpopulation is killed [3, 4]. We have observed HR to the antibiotic, fosfomycin, which is a member of its own
drug class and has primarily been used in the US in an oral form to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) [5]. The
use of fosfomycin has recently increased as bacteria become resistant to other classes of drugs [6] and due to
its strong safety profile. Due to its increased need and expected expanded approval for IV use,
fosfomycin is expected to become a much more prominent part of the antibiotic arsenal in the US.
Therefore, it is essential that we elucidate the biology of fosfomycin resistance to guide clinical use.
Strikingly, our surveillance data revealed that the rate of fosfomycin HR among carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE; 72%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB; 89%) was higher than that of any other
antibiotic tested, and that a large proportion was not detected by clinical diagnostics [7]. We recently
demonstrated that HR to diverse antibiotics, including fosfomycin, can cause treatment failure in vivo [4].
Interestingly, and thus far unique among studied examples of HR, we found that fosfomycin HR is caused by
two distinct, co-existing resistant subpopulations, both of which replicate in the presence of drug and are not
persisters, but form resistant small (R-SM) or large (R-LG) colonies. Results from a transposon screen and
metabolomic experiments revealed the underlying basis for the R-SM and R-LG cells to be metabolic
heterogeneity, rather than unstable genetic changes such as gene amplification. We will dissect how metabolic
signaling drives the expansion of the resistant R-SM subpopulation and the roles of glutamate and glutathione
in this process. We will then study the prevalence of distinct fosfomycin resistant subpopulations among
diverse clinical isolates. This work will have a sustained and powerful impact on our understanding of non-
genetic mechanisms of HR and metabolic and phenotypic heterogeneity. This will complement Project 1 which
focuses on unstable genetic mechanisms of HR. The new and fundamental insights gained will lay the
foundation for the discovery of novel therapeutics and interventions targeting subpopulations to
reduce human disease."
10813160,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and debilitating. Presently, gold-standard treatments
are only effective for approximately half of patients, underscoring the need to develop novel interventions,
particularly to target core underlying mechanisms and more effectively treat this recurrent disorder.
 Rumination, the tendency to perseverate about depressive symptoms, contributes to MDD onset and
predicts treatment non-response and relapse. At the neural level, rumination is characterized by elevated
functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), and prior research also has consistently
demonstrated patterns of DMN hyperconnectivity in MDD. Interestingly, mindfulness meditation, which trains
attentional focus to the present moment, reduces perseverative thinking, ruminative tendencies, and depression
symptoms. Further, our research and others have shown that adolescents can apply mindfulness practices to
decrease perceived stress, increase sustained attention, and suppress DMN activity. Although mindfulness has
profound mental health benefits, for some, mindfulness alone may not be sufficient to mitigate ruminative
tendencies during a depressive episode. That is, MDD symptoms, including reduced motivation, inattention, and
lack of self-efficacy, may impede a patient’s progress in successfully acquiring and utilizing mindfulness
strategies necessary to change perceptions about one’s environment and relationships. To directly address this
challenge, we propose using real-time fMRI neurofeedback to enhance the acquisition and utilization of
mindfulness skills to better target DMN hyperconnectivity, rumination, and depressive symptoms.
 We developed a novel, 15-minute mindfulness-based, real-time neurofeedback (mbNF) paradigm
whereby people observe a visual display of their brain activity and practice mindfulness to volitionally reduce
DMN activation. In the R61 phase, 90 adolescents (ages 13-18) diagnosed with MDD will complete a 45-minute
mindfulness training outside the scanner. To test target engagement of reducing DMN hyperconnectivity and
optimal dosing, adolescents will then be randomized to receive either a 15- or a 30-minute mbNF session
(n=45/dose group). If we meet our Go criterion (i.e., significantly reducing DMN hyperconnectivity), we will then
proceed to the R33 phase to investigate whether mindfulness with mbNF outperforms mindfulness only. Thus,
a new sample of 120 depressed adolescents (ages 13-18) will participate in a double-blind randomized clinical
trial and receive mindfulness with the optimal mbNF dose (i.e., per the R61) or mindfulness only (n=60/group).
We will test–using clinician-administered instruments, self-reports, and ecological momentary assessment–
whether compared to mindfulness only, mindfulness with mbNF contributes to a greater reduction in clinician
assessed depression symptoms (primary outcome) as well as decreased rumination (secondary outcome)
across the post-treatment, 1-month, and 3-month assessments. As a whole, mbNF is directly in line with
precision medicine initiatives, and if successful, could revolutionize clinical care for depressed adolescents."
10868708,"The COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continues to result in
significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although effective vaccines and therapeutics have been
introduced, COVID-19 will continue to persist as a public health issue as a result of vaccine
resistance/hesitancy and risk of reinfection, the emergence of variants of concern that may evade current
vaccines, and the potential existence of latent viral reservoirs. The adverse outcomes associated with COVID-
19 are increased by a number of pre-existing conditions, notably diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
hypertension. These conditions share obesity and insulin resistance (IR) as a common underlying feature,
which has raised the question of whether obesity per se is an independent risk factor for more severe COVID-
19 outcomes in the absence of clinically diagnosed diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension. This
concept is supported by previously described effects of obesity on respiratory disease and the immune
response. Evidence is also accumulating for altered glucose and lipid metabolism and new-onset diabetes in
COVID-19 patients that can persist after recovery from acute infection, and that constitutes an important
component of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). These data suggest that, while obesity and metabolic
disease affect the acute COVID-19, that there are a reciprocal acute and post-acute effects of COVID-19 on
metabolic control. We hypothesize that: (1) obesity/IR in the absence of other conditions such as frank
diabetes, CVD, or hypertension will increase the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute disease
pathology; and (2) that SARS-CoV-2 infection will exacerbate pre-existing preclinical metabolic disease as
reflected in progression to more advanced, clinically evident disease. We propose to address these
hypotheses through pursuit of the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1. Determine the effect of pre-existing obesity/IR on the acute response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the post-acute progression of metabolic
disease.
We will employ a nonhuman primate preclinical model of lean, metabolically healthy and obese, insulin-
resistant adult male rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 over a 2-week (acute phase) or 6-month
(post-acute) course of disease, during which time comprehensive longitudinal assessments of viral load, lung
pathology, peripheral and adipose immune cell responses, and glucose and lipid metabolism will be performed.
At necropsy following the acute and post-acute studies, islet function will be assessed and multiple tissue
samples collected for determination of viral distribution and persistence in potential latent reservoirs. The
proposed studies represent a unique opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reciprocal
relationship between COVID-19 and metabolic disease in an experimentally tractable preclinical model."
10748400,"Viral manipulation of mitotic and antiviral signal transduction determines the outcome of infection, but remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, our laboratory studies a family of protein kinases comprised of homologs widely expressed in poxviruses and in all multicellular eukaryotes. The long term goal of our research is to determine how poxviruses usurp and redirect signaling cascades governing mitotic and host defense effectors responsive to foreign DNA. Mammalian poxviruses express two proteins, B1 and B12, which are homologous to each other and to three eukaryotic protein kinases named vaccinia related kinases (VRKs). Comparative studies of B1 and VRK1 revealed that both enzymes directly modify the cellular protein BAF. Importantly, BAF acts as both a mitotic regulator and antiviral effector by binding and compacting dsDNA, a property that is inactivated via phosphorylation by B1 or VRK1. Our new data argue that B1 and cellular VRKs co-regulate other pathways as well, including an antiviral pathway activated by the B12 protein. Our data indicate that B12 directs strong repression of vaccinia DNA replication via partly unknown mechanisms also governed by B1. Intriguingly, B12 is a nuclear poxviral protein and a non-catalytic kinase or `pseudokinase', which are of key innovative importance for this proposal. Pseudokinases are members of the pseudoenzyme family, about which little is known in viruses. It is our central hypothesis that vaccinia B1 and B12 form a novel signaling axis that supplants and redirects cellular VRK pathways regulating BAF and other VRK substrates such as histones and the HUSH (Human Silencing Hub) complex. To test our hypothesis, we propose three aims. AIM 1) Determine how B1 and B12 remodel VRK1-responsive signaling during poxvirus infection. This Aim tests the hypothesis that B12 interacts with VRKs in the nucleus, thereby altering H2A, BAF, and HUSH regulation. Characterization of B12 interaction with BAF, B1, and cellular VRKs in vitro and in cultured cells will be achieved. AIM 2) Determine the molecular mechanisms governing B12 repression of poxvirus DNA replication. This Aim tests the hypothesis that the B12/VRK1 complex plays key roles in the mechanism of B12 signaling dysregulation. Structure/function analysis of B12 through targeted mutational analysis, novel loss of function screens, and investigation of B12 phosphoregulation are outlined in this Aim. AIM 3) Determine how viral/cellular pseudokinases mediate repression of the poxvirus lifecycle and converge with protein phosphatase signaling. This Aim will test the hypotheses that B1 and VRK2 kinases regulate B12 via direct phosphorylation while VRK3 and the phosphatase PP2A control dynamic regulation of B1/VRK1 substrates, leading to manipulation of downstream antiviral responses. The completion of this work will: fill gaps in our understanding of poxvirus manipulation of nuclear processes, yield broadly relevant insights to the field of kinase-pseudokinase biology, and provide needed information of how mitotic and antiviral signaling interweave."
10746460,"Abstract
 The spread of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can influence the
dynamics, function, and survival of microbial communities. A major mechanism of HGT, conjugation, plays a
critical role in the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. By combining high-
throughput phenotypic quantification and genomic sequencing, we recently showed that >25% of >200 clinical
bacterial isolates expressing extended spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs) can effectively transfer their resistance
through conjugation. The widespread of transferable plasmids raises fundamental questions regarding the
determinants of their persistence and how it can be reversed. Past studies have established that the persistence
of a plasmid depends on two critical traits – the fitness effect of the plasmid and its transfer rate. In preliminary
work, we discovered a robust threshold-linear correlation between plasmid burden and conjugation
efficiency. Most of the plasmids do not experience a significant increase in burden unless their conjugation
efficiency reaches a threshold. Beyond the threshold, a significant tradeoff emerges between the two aspects:
the faster a plasmid transfer, the greater the burden it causes to the host. This tradeoff has implications for
the persistence and evolution of plasmids in microbial communities. Building on the foundation of our published
work and the preliminary results, the central goal of the proposed research is to examine this quantitative
correlation in terms of its underlying molecular mechanisms and its general applicability (different plasmids,
bacterial hosts, and growth environments). We will also investigate the ecological and evolutionary
consequences. To achieve this goal, we will quantify this correlation for a broad spectrum of transferable
plasmids in different bacterial hosts, examine the expression patterns of genes associated with plasmids and
hosts using sequencing, and predict and measure persistence of these plasmids under different experimental
conditions. The proposed research will generate unprecedented, quantitative measurements of modulation of
HGT by antibiotics and other environmental factors."
10814796,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder of old age, is
clinically hallmarked by memory loss and neuropathologically by accumulation of Aβ plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Synaptic dysfunction has recently emerged as another early
key feature of AD; evidence suggests that synaptic density decreases up to 30% in preclinical
stages of AD and correlates more closely with cognitive deficits than Aβ pathology. Although age
is the single biggest risk factor for developing AD, the observation that even individuals at genetic
risk for AD or harboring AD neuropathology are able to remain cognitively normal as they age has
refocused research away from risk and underscored the need for investigations of the factors that
confer resilience in hopes of reducing disability and disease incidence. KLOTHO is dubbed an
anti-aging and longevity gene, and plays a key role in cellular metabolism, central nervous system
maturation, and synaptic plasticity. Critical to this proposal is that KLOTHO also seems to
enhance synaptic integrity and protects from neurodegeneration. Thus, this integrative, clinically
relevant project will rigorously investigate whether KLOTHO 1) confers resilience against age-
and AD-related synaptic dysfunction, and 2) modifies the relationship between such dysfunction
and cognitive decline both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The proposed study will be
embedded within the robust framework of two well-characterized and longitudinally followed
cohorts of ~2,000 at-risk, late-middle-aged adults (the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s
Prevention [WRAP] and the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center [WADRC]). All
participants are already genotyped for KLOTHO and have been cognitively phenotyped for up to
20 years under WRAP/WADRC. The R01 will provide resources for a subset of these participants
(N=150) to undergo multimodal biomarker assessment ([11C]UCB-J PET imaging, CSF and
blood-based biomarkers) at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Completion of this study has the
potential to provide invaluable insights and druggable targets for forestalling brain/cognitive
deterioration with advancing age or AD pathological burden."
10769887,"Project Summary
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of oropharyngeal cancers in the US. Despite the safety and
effectiveness of the HPV vaccine (HPV-V), coverage is far below that for other routine adolescent vaccines
and the Healthy People 2030 goal of 80%. HPV-V promotion at dental visits is seen as a prime opportunity to
prevent oropharyngeal and other cancers, yet many dental providers are not comfortable doing so due to lack
of knowledge and self-efficacy, and fear of harming the patient-provider relationship. Using the NIH Stage
Model of Behavioral Intervention Development as our guide, we propose to develop a theory-based
intervention to address dental provider barriers to HPV-V promotion, elucidate the intervention's behavioral
mechanisms, and test the real-world efficacy of the intervention in catalyzing provider HPV-V promotion. The
intervention will consist of 1) provider training about HPV/HPV-V; 2) tailored scripts to aid providers in
responding to patient/parent/guardian concerns about HPV-V. During the UG3 phase, we will randomize 21
HealthPartners Dental Group clinics to intervention vs. usual care (UC; n=~131 providers). UG3 aims are to:
develop survey measures and pilot-test provider HPV-V promotion training (Aim 1) and tailored scripts (Aim 2);
develop measures and methods for monitoring provider fidelity to the training and intervention activities (Aim
3); and draft compliance/study documents and obtain IRB/NIDCR approvals (Aim 4). During the UH3 phase,
we will conduct a cluster (clinic)-randomized clinical trial (intervention vs. UC) to test the real-world efficacy of
the intervention to increase HPV-V promotion activity (Aim 5). We will assess whether the intervention
impacted the three intended behavioral mechanism targets: increased knowledge of HPV/HPV-V; increased
self-efficacy for HPV-V promotion; and reduced fear of HPV-V promotion negatively affecting the patient-
provider relationship (Aim 6). For each target, we will also assess whether the intervention's effects followed
the full mechanistic pathway to the endpoint behavior, HPV-V promotion (Aim 7). Beyond our aims, we will
conduct exploratory work examining two additional candidate behavioral mechanisms: adequacy of material
resources to support dental providers in promoting HPV-V, and providers' perception that HPV-V promotion
comports with their professional identity. We will also conduct an exploratory analysis of the intervention's
efficacy in increasing HPV-V uptake (30-day post-visit patient vaccination rates). Our long-term goal is to
reduce HPV and oropharyngeal cancer prevalence through HPV-V promotion by dental providers. Significant
impact of the project includes: 1) developing the first theory-based behavioral intervention for HPV-V promotion
aimed at dental providers; 2) delivering the first evidence of real-world efficacy of such an intervention; 3)
illuminating behavioral mechanisms purported to underlie provider behavior change; 4) producing fundamental
knowledge to guide future HPV-V promotion intervention development; and 5) advancing the science of
behavior change by revealing behavioral principles underlying provider behavior change."

high quality, reproducible data requires extensive expertise in protocol development. The development of
Core C, the Immunophenotyping Core, will serve as a Shared Resource Laboratory by providing COBRE
investigators access to technical expertise to take advantage of existing state-of-the-art immunophenotyping

will have expertise in a range of experimental techniques in the field of immunophenotyping such as multianalyte
extracellular and intracellular flow cytometry, multi-analyte bead arrays, super-resolution fluorescent immunohistochemistry
and in situ hybridizations. Core C personnel will work closely with COBRE investigators to
optimize experimental design, develop immunophenotyping protocol, execute immunophenotyping experiments,
and analyze data. Thus, Core C will be a conduit between COBRE PI laboratories and the LSUHSC-S Research
Core Facility, allowing these laboratories to extend their research into the fields of immunology, inflammation

10819547,"Project 2 - ABSTRACT 
 The work proposed in this study seeks to investigate the role of macrophages colonization by Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae (N.g) during infection and the impact on gonorrhea development. Because N.g is a highly human 
adapted pathogen, it has developed numerous mechanisms to avoid and actively suppress innate and adaptive 
immune responses. Macrophages are present in significant numbers throughout the genitourinary mucosae and 
represent about 10% of total number of leukocytes recovered from these tissues. Thus, it’s likely that N.g 
encounters these cells during infection and that macrophages play an important role in N.g pathogenesis. We 
uncovered that N.g colonizes and establishes topologically distinct colonies in macrophages. During colonization 
N.g manipulates the actin cytoskeleton to create an intracellular niche supportive of bacterial replication. This 
new model of N.g persistence in macrophages is significant for gonorrhea symptomatology and outcome, since 
the relevant cellular reservoir of bacteria during in vivo infections has yet to be identified. Therefore, we 
hypothesize that N.g colonizes and alters the macrophages immune response in order to establish persistent 
growth within its host. In the first aim of this proposal we will investigate the transcriptional changes that occur in 
the infected cell and the bacterium during N.g colonization of macrophages. In the second aim we will assess 
the presence and the function of macrophages in a mouse model of N.g infection."
10758571,"Abstract
Until and unless we better understand and prevent spillovers of bat-borne viruses into intermediate hosts
and humans, we will be severely limited in our ability to stop pandemics. Henipaviruses are bat-borne, RNA
viruses that spillover through this route. Nearly half of all reported human henipavirus infections have been
associated with contact with sick domesticated animals, though our understanding of drivers of henipavirus
spillovers and specific transmission pathways remains severely limited. Building on preliminary data about
bat, domesticated animal and human infections, this multidisciplinary study integrates epidemiology, ecology,
and anthropology to identify spillover pathways for henipaviruses into domesticated animals in Bangladesh and
the risk they pose to human health. Our first aim is to identify drivers of henipavirus spillovers into
domesticated animals in Faridpur, Bangladesh. We will use multiplex pan-henipavirus assays to identify
infections in Pteropus medius bats and domesticated animals living nearby this roost through cross-sectional
and prospective studies. Combined with intensive studies of bat-domesticated animal interactions and weather
data, we will build statistical models to identify the relative contribution of each of these factors. Our second aim
is to describe which henipaviruses are being transmitted from bats to domesticated animals. Serologic
studies of animals in Bangladesh show that they are frequently infected with non-Nipah henipaviruses. Through
surveillance for and sampling of sick domesticated animals, we will describe the specific viruses that spillover
from bats in Faridpur. Our third aim is to determine the risk of henipavirus transmission from domesticated
animals to humans. We hypothesize that undetected henipavirus spillovers in humans are occurring through
contact with sick domesticated animals and will conduct cross-sectional and prospective serosurveys of humans
who have close contact with sick animals in Faridpur. We remain ignorant about henipavirus spillovers
through intermediate hosts – including the specific viruses spilling over, the frequency and distribution of
spillovers, and the pathways of transmission – at our own peril. The knowledge gained from this study will be
immediately applicable to human and animal health programs in Bangladesh and other countries where
henipaviruses circulate in bats. By learning about which henipaviruses infect humans, and how they are infected,
we can advise public health surveillance programs on how to optimize detection and epidemiologic
investigation of cases across Bangladesh. Our investigations about spillovers in Faridpur can also be scaled-
up to other areas of Bangladesh and countries where henipaviruses circulate in bats so that we can truly begin
to appreciate the scale of henipavirus spillovers in the global landscape."
10758615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In 2021, it is estimated that there will be 149,480 new cases of colon cancer diagnosed in the United
States and 52,980 CRC patients will die from this disease in which the incidence and death are only slightly
lower in women compared to men. Early diagnosis and improved treatments have decreased the incidence of
CRC in the United States; however, global rates of this disease are increasing, particularly in developing
countries. Individuals with a family history of colon cancer or inherited genetic mutations have a high risk for
developing CRC, however, it is estimated that 60-65% of all cases are “sporadic” with no inherited or genetic
risk factors in their background. Some of the risk factors for the sporadic CRCs are shared by many other
cancers and this includes age but also other preventable factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking,
low fiber/high fat diets, alcohol consumption and high intakes of red meat. Another sub-class of CRC patients
are young adults and the incidence of disease among this group has been increasing particularly in high
income developed countries. Surgery is a major first option for many colon cancer patients and this can also be
accompanied or preceded by radiation and neoadjuvant therapy. High risk patients with stage III and IV colon
cancer are treated with various drug combinations including fluorouracil, leucovorin, folinic acid, oxaliplatin and
capecitabine which inhibit the risk of disease recurrence. In addition to cytotoxic drug therapies more precision
medicine approaches that target specific genes such as EGFR and pathways (angiogenesis) are being
developed along with immunotherapies. The proposed research will focus on potential mechanisms and
clinical applications of bis-indole derived (CDIMs) agents that bind the orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1,
Nur77). NR4A1 is overexpressed in colon cancer patients and regulates expression not only of pro-oncogenic
genes and pathways but also PD-L1 and genes associated with T-cell exhaustion that can be identified in
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Preliminary studies confirm that CDIM/NR4A1 antagonists exhibit both
chemotherapeutic activity but also downregulate PD-L1 and reverse T-cell exhaustion and proposed studies in
Aim 1 will determine the underlying mechanisms using in vitro cell culture and syngeneic mouse models (Aim
1). In Aim 2 the chemotherapeutic and immunologic effects of CDIM/NR4A1 antagonists will be investigated in
an inducible APC knockout mouse model and in mice crossed with whole body and intestinal specific NR4A1
deletion. These studies, coupled with histological analysis of cycling stem cells and single cell analysis of the
tumor microenvironment and immune system will confirm the role of NR4A1 as an important emerging drug
target for both colon cancer chemo- and immune therapies."
10767820,"Over the past century, mean life expectancy in the United States has increased more than 50% (from 47 to 75
years), primarily through the elimination of lives lost due to premature death. Among those 65 years and older,
chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and impose a major burden on longevity and quality of life.
There have been limited efforts to attenuate the impact on quality of life that these diseases have – leading to
decrease in mobility and development of frailty that lead to acceleration of the aging process. This proposed
program project, “Skeleton and Joint Degeneration with Aging”, will be conducted by the Johns Hopkins Center
for Musculoskeletal Research and will be focused on improving our understanding of cellular mechanisms in
normal aging that lead to decreased mobility and increased pain and frailty. To support the Center goals, we will
establish the infrastructure, resources, and expertise that are required to support interdisciplinary basic, clinical
and translational research to investigate our central hypothesis that uncoupled remodeling of subchondral
bone and endplate porosity through cellular senescence leads to joint and spinal degeneration and the
development of pain, frailty, and mobility disorders during the normal aging process.
To ensure efficient operation and communication, the Administrative Core will provide the necessary
infrastructure and resources to achieve the program objectives through coordination of communication and
efforts among the four projects and three cores. The Administrative Core will achieve these goals through four
aims. The first aim will establish the administrative framework to support the individual scientific projects and
cores through several mechanisms of oversight, including establishment of Steering and Advisory Committees.
The second aim will provide the administrative support necessary for the successful operation of the program
project grant through monitoring and management of the project and core budgets, provision of a centralized
web and communication platform to support regularly scheduled meetings. The third aim will support outreach
and education efforts of the Center investigators within the larger research and medical communities at Johns
Hopkins University and beyond. The fourth aim will provide common data management and statistical analytic
support for the Center investigators.
In summary, the Administrative Core will establish the necessary infrastructure and resources to promote a
collaborative environment to ensure the success of the Center projects and cores to further our understanding
of the cellular mechanisms that lead to limited mobility, pain, and frailty during the normal aging process."
10767824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of the in vivo Animal model & histology core is to consolidate key personnel and equipment to
provide a centralized facility that will enhance collaborative and multidisciplinary investigations into multiple
mechanisms in age related skeletal degenerative disease. Core B will serve as a center to realize an optimized
and reasonable utilization and allocation of experimental and human resources. Employing skillful personnel to
conduct the common procedures in a standardized manner is not only a cost- and time-efficient strategy but also
can maximally reduce the potential for bias and increase the scientific rigor. Ranging from tissue histological
analysis to functional behavior test, Core B will facilitate the investigation of age related skeletal degenerative
diseases from four aspects: 1. Animal models and microsurgeries. The proposed surgical animal models:
destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), lumbar spine instability (LSI), dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
exposure for in vivo imaging will be conducted in the Core B. Our core will set up a team with members who
have extensive experience in conducting complicated microsurgeries in small animals. 2. Histological grading.
Core B will perform histological grading based on the Safranin O/fast green and H&E staining. The osteoarthritis
research society international (OARSI) scoring system will be applied to assess the joint degenerative status
while the grading method for classification of age-related changes in lumbar intervertebral discs will be used to
determine the degenerative status of lumbar discs. 3. Micro-CT analysis. Micro-CT measurements will be done

Persistent pain, particularly at rest, profoundly affects quality of life and daily physical activity, especially in the
elderly population. Pain itself is a risk factor for the development of future functional decline. Moreover,
decrease in mobility in turn significantly increases the risk of many chronic diseases. Low back pain (LBP) is
an extremely common health problem and affects roughly 80% of people during their life course and is the
leading cause of activity limitation and work absence. Thus, spinal degeneration with LBP is one of the most
prevalent diseases leading to a decline in mobility and frailty. Unfortunately, we still do not understand the
source of LBP and there is no effective disease-modified therapy.
Spinal amphiarthrodial joints are recognized as a functional unit, each of which exhibit unique responses to
mechanical loading and degenerate with aging. Especially, vertebral endplates undergo ossification and
become porous under unbalance mechanical forces or during aging. We have previously found a large number
of osteoclasts in the porous sclerotic endplates in LBP patients and aged mice (spinal hypersensitivity model),
suggesting active bone remodeling in endplates. We have also identified that over 70% of these osteoclasts
are senescent cells, which have been reported to lead to age associated tissue dysfunction. Moreover, clinical
and rodent animal studies demonstrated that nerve density was higher in porous endplates than that in normal
endplates in LBP patients and animal models, suggesting that the aberrantly innervated endplates may be a
source of LBP in patients and spinal hypersensitivity in mice. We have recently shown that osteoclasts secrete
Netrin-1, an axonal guidance molecule, to induce sensory nerve axonal growth in the endplates. Reduction of
osteoclasts inhibited the sensory innervation into endplates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that during
bone remodeling, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) activates its EP4 receptor on sensory nerves to decrease
sympathetic tone, which induced osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. Our pilot data
showed senescent osteoclasts, PGE2 and Netrin-1 levels were significantly increased in porous endplates.
Therefore, we are in a unique position to determine the role of sensory nerve dysregulation of the vertebral
endplate as the driver of spinal functional unit degeneration with aging. We hypothesize that elevated PGE2
concentrations and sensory innervation in the porous EP induced by senescent OCs and their
secretion of excessive Netrin-1 mediate spinal hypersensitivity in mice (LBP in patients). Specifically,
we will first determine the effect of osteoclastic SnCs on spinal hypersensitivity (Aim 1). We will next
investigate the mechanism of sensory innervation by senescent osteoclast-produced Netrin-1 in porous
endplates (Aim 2). We will finally examine if the elevated PGE2 level in porous endplates induce spinal
hypersensitivity during spine degeneration (Aim 3)."

Low back pain is the leading cause of disability, driven predominantly by aging. Pain contributes to frailty by
lowering quality of life and limiting physical activities. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is the most common
cause of low back pain, but is a non-specific finding. No cause-directed, mechanism-based medications protect
the spine from progression of degeneration and pain. The spine is a complex joint, built from alternating bony
vertebrae and IVD. The vertebral endplate forms a structural boundary between the IVD and the vertebral body.
Recent studies have implicated that the vertebral endplate plays a key role in the development of spinal
degeneration and low back pain. We have recently reported that daily administration of parathyroid hormone
(PTH) in aged mice for two months increases IVD cell size, restoring the vacuoles and rejuvenating the IVD. We
have also found that cartilaginous endplates become ossified and porous during aging, which induces sensory
innervation for spinal hypersensitivity. Our preliminary data demonstrates that endplate sclerosis improves with
PTH administration. Most importantly, we have found that the aberrant innervation of the endplate is reversed
with PTH and is associated with a reduction in pain behaviors in the IVD mouse models. We hypothesize that
PTH stimulated anabolic bone formation remodels the sclerotic, porous EP to reduce aberrant nociceptive
innervation. In this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Examine vertebral endplate
remodeling in the process of PTH-induced rejuvenation of IVD; Aim 2: Identify cellular target of PTH-induced
remodeling of porous vertebral endplates; and Aim 3: Determine the mechanism of PTH-induced reduction of
sensory innervation and improved pain behaviors. Our study team is comprised of basic scientists with expertise
in bone biology regarding PTH cell signaling mechanisms and neuroscience regarding nociceptor neuronal
activity, as well as, physician-scientists with translation expertise in mouse models of human disease, spinal
degeneration, and clinical use of PTH. We are uniquely suited to further understand the mechanistic actions of
PTH and potential as a disease modifying treatment of low back pain. Understanding the mechanism of PTH
treatment of low back pain will provide necessary data to inform further drug development and clinical trial
designs exploring activation of the PTH signaling pathway as a disease-modifying treatment of spinal
degeneration.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent age-associated chronic joint disease. Although direct joint injury and
excessive mechanical overloading are considered as important contributors to the development of OA, only
approximately 12% of the overall prevalence of symptomatic OA is attributable to posttraumatic OA of the hip,
knee, or ankle. Aging is recognized as the most important risk factor for OA, and the metabolic phenotype
becomes the second most frequent subtype of OA among patients enrolled in clinical studies. Recently, it has
been recognized that cellular senescence is a key driver for the progression of post-traumatic OA. However,
whether and how senescent cells (SnCs) are involved in the development of non-traumatic OA remain poorly
understood. In our preliminary study, we found accumulated SnCs at the joint subchondral bone marrow of both
spontaneous aging OA mice and STR/Ort mice, a spontaneous OA mice associated with metabolic dysregulation.
Increased SnCs were not detected in subchondral bone marrow of a post-traumatic OA mice. Therefore,
subchondral bone marrow cell senescence may represent a unique feature of non-traumatic subtype of OA
distinguishable from post-traumatic OA. Moreover, we identified that close to 80% of the SnCs are bone marrow
Pre-osteoclast (Pre-OC). Pre-OCs isolated from old mice, relative to young mice, had increased expression of
common senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors and much higher expression of
angiogenesis factor PDGF-BB, a potent angiogenesis factor. It is known that increased subchondral bone
angiogenesis is a major contributor to the development of OA. Therefore, the excessive PDGF-BB secreted by
subchondral bone marrow SnCs may contribute to aberrant subchondral bone angiogenesis. Our central
hypothesis is that senescent Pre-OCs induce aberrant subchondral bone angiogenesis by secreting excessive
PDGF-BB, leading to OA-related joint structural damage. The hypothesis will be tested by the following Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will trace the SnCs in synovial tissue, articular cartilage, and subchondral bone tissue of the
joints by detecting the cellular senescence markers in spontaneous aging OA mice and STR/Ort mice. We will
also trace the SnCs at different stages of OC lineage and verify the SASP phenotype of the cells in bone marrow
of the mice. Aim 2 will examine the necessity and sufficiency of Pre-OCs-derived PDGF-BB in age-associated
subchondral bone angiogenesis and OA development. In Aim 3, we will first define the contribution of cellular
senescence to subchondral bone angiogenesis and osteogenesis by selectively eliminating the SnCs in OA mice.
We will then test if blockage of Pre-OC senescence using both genetic and pharmacologic approaches
attenuates OA progression."

 Cellular communication involves the interplay of small molecule signaling species as well as a myriad of
enzymatic activities that are tightly regulated in both space and time to orchestrate biological responses. The
malfunction of these pathways results in abnormal cellular function and human disease. Our long-term goal is
to develop a detailed, molecular level understanding of cellular signaling in both normal and diseased states.
We approach this problem through the development and application of designer fluorophore- and protein-
based systems. Our lab has developed new classes of fluorescent probes for monitoring and responding to the
presence of signaling species associated with human disease. In complementary work, we have developed
protein-based approaches for precisely controlling cellular signaling events. During the next five years, we will
apply our technologies to illuminate spatial aspects of cell signaling as well as the fine details of the molecular
assemblies involved in cell signaling. We will also pursue new platforms for the gated release of agents in
living systems and approaches for monitoring signaling enzyme activity in living cells. Together, this work will
provide a more detailed understanding of cellular processes associated with human disease."

organization and gene transcription? 2) How do more recently discovered histone PTMs
and reader domains contribute to gene transcription? 3) What are the rules by which
histone readers engage nucleosomes and how do these binding events regulate

The cornerstone of obesity therapy - diet, physical activity and behavioral modification - fails to produce sufficient
long-term weight loss in most individuals. Clinical guidelines recommend the addition of anti-obesity medication
(AOM) when conservative methods are less than optimal. Yet even with the use of AOM, there is a wide range
of inter-individual weight loss suggesting that there are “responders” and “non-responders.” The variability in
response to AOMs underscores the heterogeneity of obesity and the need for more personalized treatment that
accounts for individual differences in etiologic factors. Given the strong heritability of obesity, it is possible that
genetic factors play a role in an individual’s response to a given pharmacotherapy. This proposal focuses on
the FDA-approved AOM, Contrave, which is a combination of two medications, naltrexone and bupropion (NB).
Naltrexone is a µ-opioid receptor (MOPR) antagonist and bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and
norepinephrine. Clinical trials of NB demonstrate a mean weight loss of 6.1% after 56 weeks of treatment;
however, only 48% of patients achieved a clinically significant reduction in body weight of ³5%. Knowledge of
the likely mechanisms of action of NB makes it possible to address what might underlie the variability in response.
The bupropion component activates the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron, a key regulator in decreasing food
intake and stimulating energy expenditure, and occurs in part through stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors
(DRD2). Naltrexone also activates POMC neurons by binding MOPR. We postulated that some of the variability
in response to NB may be due to the Taq1A genetic variant (rs1800497) located in the ankyrin repeat and kinase
domain-containing protein 1 (ANKK1) gene, adjacent to the DRD2 gene. Individuals carrying at least one minor
allele of the rs1800497 polymorphism (termed Taq1A A1+) represent about 45% of the population and have 30-
40% fewer brain DRD2. Such individuals likely have a relative deficiency in dopaminergic activation of POMC
neurons, thus, we predict they would receive the greatest benefit from a drug that remedies this deficit. With this
hypothesis in mind, we conducted a proof-of-concept pilot study reviewing charts of patients treated with NB and
indeed found that carriers of the Taq1A A1+ genotype had a greater weight loss response compared with non-
carriers, suggesting that this genotype could be used to predict successful weight loss. In Aim One, we propose
to rigorously test the hypothesis that presence of the Taq1A A1+ polymorphism is associated with greater weight
loss with NB compared with the A1- genotype. Maintenance of weight loss after discontinuation of drug treatment
will also be evaluated. In Aim Two, we will explore other genetic polymorphisms that might influence the efficacy
of NB and determine if serum prolactin level, a measure of central dopaminergic tone, may be used as a systemic
biomarker to help predict drug response. The ultimate goal is to incorporate pharmacogenetics into obesity
medicine in order to maximize results and limit unnecessary cost and exposure to side effects of medications
that provide minimal benefit to the individual patient."
10752612,"Project Summary: Spatial navigation is an essential task for living a safe, independent life. Spatial navigation
skills decline in normal aging and become progressively impaired in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 1,2,
severely impacting their daily life function, independence, and health 3. Despite the use of compensatory
navigational tools like signs, maps, and verbal directions, supporting spatial navigation in older adults and
those with age-associated neurodegenerative disease remains a challenge. A major impediment to designing
interventions is the limited understanding of how spatial direction comprehension is affected by the normal
aging process and neurodegenerative disease. The goal of this project is to determine how normal aging
and age-associated neurodegenerative disease affect spatial direction comprehension, and to
elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning spatial direction comprehension in healthy young and
older adults.
 Our primary hypothesis is that spatial direction comprehension is supported as a result of increased
connectivity between regions of the brain dedicated to encoding individual formats (i.e.,visual scenes, arrows,
and words), which will result in specific patterns of impairment among older adults and those with amnestic
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. We also hypothesize that the
intraparietal sulcus (IPS) – a region that encodes spatial directions with respect to the navigator's current
facing direction – will function as a hub by computing spatial directions from all representational formats, an
idea which has been supported by recent advances in fMRI. To test these hypotheses, the candidate will
employ converging methodologies from cognitive neuroscience, including advanced functional magnetic
resonance imaging techniques (network neuroscience and functional connectivity), and behavioral assessment
of healthy young adults and older adults, and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
 This award will enable the candidate to learn critical new methodologies, which will help uncover the
neural instantiation of spatial direction comprehension. Through research projects and training experiences,
the candidate will apply these methodologies to test new hypotheses and questions about how spatial direction
comprehension deteriorates in older adults and in patients with age-related dementias. This research proposal
will be undertaken at the University of Florida – an elite research institution with access to fMRI, a large
population of older adults with and without age-related dementia, and experts in network neuroscience,
neurology, and cognitive neuroscience. This award will also provide critical preliminary data that will be applied
to an R01 proposal on supporting spatial navigation in older adults and those with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias."
10784673,"Abstract:
Opportunistic CNS invasion by eukaryotic pathogens requires a highly coordinated, yet restrained, multi-
pronged immune response. CNS Infection by extracellular parasites such as Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba,
and Balamuthia have proven nearly impossible to treat, yet immune directed therapies against N. fowleri have
the potential alter the course of almost universally fatal disease. The “brain eating amoeba” N. fowleri is
responsible for a devastating form of meningoencephalitis known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis
(PAM) that is almost universally fatal (>97%) despite intensive clinical intervention, and new therapeutic
approaches are desperately needed. The protective relevance of Naegleria-reactive antibodies (Abs) in
humans is unclear, but animal models of PAM suggest that vaccinations and passive Ab administration
variably delay death and foster survival. Extracellular parasites cannot simply be neutralized by antibody, but
rather immunity relies on targeting antibody isotype specific effector mechanisms from immune cells. After
parasites are bound by antibody, isotype specific binding to fragment crystallizable receptors (FcRs) can direct
cell type specific effector functions against parasites. Prior studies of N. fowleri specific antibody responses
have not rigorously linked antibody specificity with the functional outcomes of individual\antibody isotypes,
creating a critical gap in understanding how antibody can optimally eliminate parasites from the within the
central nervous system (CNS) while not exacerbating immunopathology. We’ve generated a monoclonal Ab
specific for N. fowleri cell surface antigens that has shown strong anti-proliferative effects on parasites in vitro
and facilitates survival of infected hosts in vivo. This proposal seeks to define how combining anti-proliferative
effects of antibody and isotype specific binding can facilitate effective immune response against extracellular
CNS parasites while maintaining neuroprotection. Completion of this project will define new therapeutic
approaches to CNS infections that currently have few effective options and very poor outcomes."
10791741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of small molecule inhibitors has revolutionized targeted therapeutics, especially in the field of
protein kinases. However, pharmaceutical development continues to be plagued by two problems: (i) designing
specific drugs with limited off-target toxicity and (ii) combating the occurrence of resistance mutations in the
target of interest. The role of binding kinetics, referring to a ligand’s association and dissociation rate to its target,
are underexplored and underexploited in addressing these issues. In the non-equilibrium environment of the
human body, drug on- and off-rates have proven to be superior optimization parameters for candidate
compounds than the traditional IC50 and KD metrics. Furthermore, mutations that reduce drug residence time,
defined as how long a drug stays bound to its target, can presumably confer resistance to therapy.
Imatinib, the seminal achievement of rational drug design, inhibits the BCR-Abl oncoprotein and has reduced
the mortality rate for chronic myelogenous leukemia by 80%. Imatinib’s specificity for Abl kinase is due to its
conformational selectivity, and its success has sparked intense efforts to discover specific inhibitors of kinases
dysregulated in cancer and inflammatory disease. Despite its clinical success, relapse to imatinib therapy due to
resistance mutations is common, and a fundamental understanding of how mutations distant from the ligand
binding site cause resistance continues to elude us. We have preliminarily identified a series of patient-derived
resistance mutations that paradoxically show no change in equilibrium affinity for imatinib. We have also
validated that the Abl N368S mutant causes imatinib resistance by increasing drug dissociation rate. Therefore,
I propose using these Abl kinase mutations as a model system to explore how binding kinetics affect ligand
specificity, potency, and efficacy. My central hypothesis is that altered inhibitor binding or dissociation
kinetics could cause resistance independent of inhibitor affinity. I will explore this hypothesis by measuring
the effects of Abl kinase mutations on drug residence time and efficacy and by defining the conformational
changes of the Abl N368S substitution.
Through these studies, I will determine the structural mechanism of “kinetic resistance” mutations, a novel type
of drug resistance which I believe extends throughout the kinome. I will also elucidate key structural factors in
the conformational exchange of Abl kinase and the imatinib unbinding process. In addition, I will provide insight
into how prolonging in vivo drug action through slow dissociation rates can be applied to develop drugs with
minimal off-target toxicity. The contributions from this proposal are significant because they will validate altered
binding kinetics as both a novel mechanism of drug resistance in a highly-therapeutically relevant protein family
and as a viable strategy to improve drug specificity."
10932437,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioid analgesics are critical for acute and chronic pain management, but important side effects limit their safety
and utility, including tolerance, constipation, respiratory depression, and abuse liability. We have determined that
simultaneous activation of µ-opioid receptors (MORs), with the opioid analgesic morphine, and enhancement of
GABAergic signaling at α2 and α3 subunit-containing GABAA (α2/α3GABAA) receptors, with the novel
imidazodiazepine ligand MP-III-024, produces synergistic antinociceptive and anti-hyperalgesic effects.
Preliminary data also indicate that MP-III-024/morphine mixes produce sub-additive effects in behavioral tests
sensitive to morphine side effects, supporting further investigation of a dual pharmacological approach that
simultaneously targets MOR and α2/α3GABAA to enhance analgesic effects without increasing side effects. We
hypothesize that this dual pharmacology approach will result in more effective antinociception with reduced
development of critical opioid side effects. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a comprehensive preclinical
analysis of the effects of dual MOR-α2/α3GABAA pharmacotherapy in models of pain, tolerance, constipation,
respiratory depression, and abuse liability. We will systematically test whether κ-opioid receptors or δ-opioid
receptors also contribute to the antinociceptive effects of MP-III-024/morphine mixtures. Finally, we will
determine whether bivalent ligands designed to simultaneously target MOR and α2/α3GABAA will produce
analgesic effects and represent a new line of medication development. If successful, these studies would identify
a new method to enhance opioid analgesia, requiring lower necessary doses of opioid medications, in turn
reducing the likelihood of dangerous side effects or the development of opioid dependence and addiction."

 The effectiveness and mechanisms of stem cell-induced analgesia in treating dental pain is unknown.
We demonstrate that i.v. injections of human Stem Cells of Apical Papilla (hSCAP) reverse apical periodontitis
(infection of a tooth; AP)-induced mechanical allodynia. Moreover, hSCAP primed to periapical granulomas
(peripheral sites of tooth infection) attenuate capsaicin (CAP)-evoked intracellular Ca2+ accumulation ([Ca2+]I)
from trigeminal (TG) neurons and this effect is inhibited by anti-human macrophage migratory inhibitory factor
(MIF)-antibody (Ab). Therefore, here, we will test the central hypothesis that apical periodontitis-induced
nociceptive behaviors is reversed by hSCAP-derived release of MIF that directly inhibits TG neuronal activity.
We propose the following aims to test the central hypothesis in male and female tissues:
Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that hSCAP-derived MIF inhibits TG neuronal activities in vitro
 and in vivo. We will use anti-human MIF-Ab to evaluate the effect of in vivo release of MIF by hSCAP on
 mechanical allodynia as well as spontaneous nociception using conditioned placed preference (CPP). Next,
 using CRISPR-Cas9, we will generate a hSCAP cell line with MIF knockout. This cell line will be used to test
 the hypothesis that in vitro and in vivo hSCAP-derived MIF inhibits TG neurons and AP-induced pain
behaviors.
Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that neuronal CXCR4 and CD74 receptors mediate MIF-induced
 inhibition of TG neuronal activity in vitro and in vivo. MIF signals via the CXCR4 and CD74 receptors
 (21-23) that are expressed on mouse TG neurons (Fig. 11). We will evaluate the role of CXCR4 using
 AMD3100, a small molecule CXCR4 antagonist using in vitro Ca2+-imaging and in vivo behavioral assays.
 Next, we conditionally delete CXCR4 from TG sensory neurons to evaluate the function of CXCR4 receptors
 in vitro and in vivo. Next, will inject mice with AVV-shRNA against CD74 via an intraganglionic route to
 assess the effect of neuronal CD74 receptor knockdown on in vivo nociceptive behaviors and as well as in
 vitro Ca2+-imaging.
Specific Aim 3 will determine the signaling pathway/s activated by MIF that contribute inhibition of TG
 neuronal activity. Signaling via CD74/CXCR4 receptor occurs via Gi/o proteins. We demonstrate that 1)
 pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTx) completely reverses hSCAP-induced attenuation of [Ca2+]I (Fig. 15);
 and 2) MIF inhibits voltage gated Ca2+ currents (VGCaC; Fig 16) that is downstream of G activation. Using
 electrophysiological approaches, we will determine MIF signaling by determining Gi versus G signaling,
 type of VGCC inhibited, regulation of channels/receptors commonly known to mediate mechanical and
 spontaneous behaviors and finally study alternative Gi/o-mediated pathways commonly known post-MIF
activation.
These studies have high medical significance as they define a novel ligand-receptor system for treating
infection-induced pain, possibly leading to new non-opioid analgesics. Importantly, the combined use of
human hSCAP in rodent models foster mechanistic research and increases translational significance.
RELEVANCE: These studies aim at studying new class of non-opioid analgesics for dental pain."

 The objective of this project is to provide mechanistic information on the function and regulation of
cardiac palmitoyl-proteome (palmitoylome) in health, and how changes in the palmitoylation status of
key proteins in the heart contribute to disease development. Palmitoylation is a post-translational
modification, where a fatty acyl chain, most often palmitoyl chain, is covalently linked to the thiol side
chain of cysteine. This increase in hydrophobicity drives protein trafficking and changes their interaction
with neighboring molecules. Palmitoylation is important for 2 reasons: (1) prevalence - ~20% of human
proteins are palmitoylatable, (2) reversible - providing dynamic control of protein distribution and
function. Recently, we globally purified palmitoylated proteins from human, dog and rat hearts, and
used proteomic approach to identify 454 proteins forming a core 'cardiac palmitoylome'. Our study
defined the scope of protein palmitoylation in the heart, and broadly characterized them as 'subcellular
microdomain organizers'. We further identified 11 palmitoylating (DHHC) enzymes expressed in the
heart. The current proposal is built upon these recent progresses, and addresses 2 main questions.
First, given the numbers of known DHHC enzymes expressed in the heart (11) and substrates (454),
how is the DHHC enzyme/substrate relationship determined in cardiac myocytes? Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that DHHC enzymes, as transmembrane proteins not freely mobile in cytosol, have their
'territories' demarcated in cardiac myocytes, and proteins within their territories are potential substrates.
Second, what is the role of cardiac palmitoylome in disease development when dysregulated?
We will use junctophilin-2 (JPH2) as a case study. JPH2 is the major jSR/PM tether. It requires
palmitoylation of its cysteine side chains to strengthen the jSR/PM junctions. Genetic variants in JPH2
have been linked to cardiomyopathies, but the mechanisms underlying their pathogenicity are not clear.
Aim 2 will investigate the role of palmitoylation in determining JPH2's distribution and functions in
myocytes. Aim 3 will explore the possibility that some JPH2 genetic variants compromise
palmitoylation, and this deficiency in JPH2 palmitoylation contributes to their pathogenicity in
cardiomyopathies. Our research team combines 6 areas of expertise: (1) multiscale
detection/quantification of protein palmitoylation, (2) quantitative proteomics, (3) high-resolution
imaging/analysis, (4) bioinformatics/biostatistics, (5) modulation of CICR (Ca-induced Ca release) in
cardiomyocytes, and (6) profiling/quantification of post-translational modifications. This combination
allows us to probe the cardiac palmitoylome from single molecules to global proteome. We will also
provide fundamental information on the structure and function of JPH2, which is critical for
understanding why disease-related genetic variants in JPH2 are pathogenic.

With expanding cannabis legalization and concurrent significant increases in cannabis-related traffic fatalities,
driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) has become a major public health concern. Despite the
impairment in driving skills and increased crash risk associated with cannabis intoxication, little is known about
how individuals make the decision to drive (or not) after using cannabis. The proposed project advances our
team’s work on cannabis and DUIC risk factors to identify person-level (e.g., DUIC cognitions), within-person
processes (e.g., subjective intoxication, affective state, cannabinoid concentration, quantity, route of
administration), and contextual influences (e.g., social context, environmental conditions) that predict DUIC
behaviors in daily life. The proposed multi-method project will provide unique qualitative and quantitative
information about individual-level DUIC behavior using geographically explicit ecological momentary
assessment (EMA), which combines event-level data on cannabis use with spatio-temporal data on vehicle
movement. Our preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility of these methods by integrating passively
collected continuous location data using a vehicle-based GPS tracking device with EMA data on driving and
cannabis use. Frequent and less frequent cannabis users (N = 260) will complete smartphone measures of
cannabis use, concurrent substance use, affect, momentary impulsivity, perceived DUIC dangerousness,
driving intentions, driving motives and destinations/location, and context during a 4-week EMA period. DUIC
(i.e., driving within a pharmacologically-relevant timeframe) will be identified by integrating geospatial data (i.e.,
latitude/longitude/time and vehicle’s movement) passively and continuously collected in the field with EMA data
on cannabis use. Weekly testing of participant cannabis for Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol
(CBD) concentration will be done using a near-infrared spectroscopy device. This will be the first study to
prospectively examine the influence of within-person and contextual predictors on DUIC likelihood and
distance traveled (Aim 1). We will explore driving-related cognitions, indices of working memory capacity, and
user characteristics in relation to cannabis use and driving experience as potential moderators of the effects of
event-level predictors on DUIC (Aim 2). To provide insights on contextual factors and decision-making
processes related to DUIC, participants will complete a narrative qualitative interview focused on annotating
maps of representative DUIC and non-DUIC trips generated by GPS data during one of the four weeks of the
EMA period (Aim 3). Exploratory machine learning analyses will be used to characterize and distinguish DUIC
episodes from non-DUIC driving episodes (Aim 4). The current project will be the first full-scale study to
integrate such real-time individual-level exposure data with DUIC outcomes of interest. Findings can have
important implications for cannabis regulatory science and DUIC prevention efforts, which is critically needed
to protect public safety."

The broad goal of our continued research is to decipher the effect of estrogen deprivation, with or without
elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), on the vulnerability of the retina to neurodegeneration and to find a
preventative and/or curative pharmacological intervention to preserve the quality of vison under these
conditions. In the current grant period, we have shown that our prodrug approach (DHED) has produced the
powerful neuroprotectant, 17β-estradiol (E2), exclusively in the retina upon topical administration without
exposing the rest of the body to the unwanted side effects of the hormone. This distinguishing feature of DHED
has been demonstrated in both male and female animals. In an animal model of human glaucoma, we have
found that E2 produced locally from DHED protects the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from apoptosis, as well as
prevents visual impairment and functional deficits associated with the disease. Using proteomics, we have also
found that DHED eye drops successfully engaged E2-responsive therapeutic targets in the rat retinal proteome.
Through these studies, we have recognized that young, gonadectomized male and female animals with
normotensive IOP exhibit a proteomic landscape that is very similar to that of aged animals when compared to
young intact animals. Elevated IOP further disrupted vital protein expressions associated with signaling
networks involving neuroprotective targets and regulations of metabolic activities essential for retina health.
However, DHED eye drops completely alleviated the detrimental consequences of estrogen deprivation and
elevated IOP, suggesting that an “estrogenic” retina is needed for proper visual function. This application for
renewal addresses critical questions that stem from these collective findings. Specifically, is an E2-deprived
retina, regardless of age or elevated IOP, vulnerable to neurodegeneration, and can topical DHED be used as a
preventative and therapeutic agent to preserve the quality of vison under hypoestrogenic and/or elevated IOP
condition? Specific Aim 1 is designed to determine parameters of RGC neuroprotection and for the attenuation
of visual impairment afforded by DHED eye drops in E2-deprived animals compared to normotensive and
hypertensive ocular conditions. Proteomics- and phosphoproteomics-based studies in Specific Aim 2 will
investigate the mechanistic benefits of DHED eye drops in E2-deprived animals that exhibit normal versus
elevated IOP. Specific Aim 3 will utilize retina metabolomics to address metabolic dysregulations under
hypoestrogenic conditions and elevated IOP, compared to the amelioration of these alterations by topical DHED.
Through the integration of functional vision analyses with a multi-omics approach, we seek to advance our
understanding of E2 deprivation- and IOP-triggered ocular neurodegeneration, as well as its prevention or
treatment by topical DHED, in a comprehensive fashion."

and mortality within the United States. These statistics support a pressing need for understanding the
biochemical mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity and the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease
(ALD). Chronic alcohol metabolism impacts numerous cellular pathways including glycolysis, lipid metabolism,
the TCA cycle as well as antioxidant and inflammatory responses. There is a known biochemical link between
metabolic alterations, oxidative stress, and protein thiol redox switches (e.g., cysteine (Cys) residues);
however, very little information exists regarding how chronic alcohol metabolism impacts hepatic thiol redox
signaling and control networks. Our preliminary data supports the notion that alcohol metabolism, protein
acetylation, and Cys redox are highly associated. Therefore, we present an innovative approach for
investigating how alcohol metabolism impacts thiol redox signaling and control. Central to our aims, the thiol
redox proteome is an adaptive interface that provides a means to sense, avoid, and defend against oxidants
and other toxicants. Therefore, the hypothesis of this proposal is that alcohol metabolism impacts thiol redox
signaling and control through lysine acetylation, resulting in hepatic dyshomeostasis and contributing to ALD.
We will investigate the proposed specific aims to test our hypothesis: Specific Aim 1: Characterize altered thiol
redox signaling and control due to alcohol metabolism. Specific Aim 2: Utilize Sirtuin 1 overexpression to
define mechanisms of acetylation-redox signaling and control. Specific Aim 3: Integrate mechanisms of redox-
Cys and acetyl-Lys to elucidate CoAlation specific redox signaling. We will execute these research aims
utilizing a cutting-edge proteomics and bioinformatics approach to reveal novel redox sensing mechanisms
within hepatocytes. Elucidating how alcohol metabolism alters hepatic redox signaling and control through
novel post-translational modifications will support the development of targeted clinical interventions to
ameliorate ALD in millions of Americans."

Mortality for infants is almost 2 times higher and for children 2.6 times higher in rural communities compared
with urban settings; little is known about what portion of these children interact with the Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) system. Data for rural health disparities currently come from vital statistics and suggest that
much of the excess rural mortality occurs in conditions that are common reasons for Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) dispatch. EMS providers provide scene response, resuscitation, stabilization, and transport for
a range of life-threatening conditions and the care they deliver is a critical link in the chain of survival. Our
research on EMS care in urban areas finds that more than half of out of hospital children's emergencies have
an adverse safety event (ASE) during the delivery of care, and the highest rates are seen in children with
cardiopulmonary arrest, trauma, respiratory distress, seizures, and births. Currently, it is not known if and to
what extent potentially modifiable factors occurring during EMS care contribute to disparities in mortality. This
project proposes to address this knowledge gap through the following aims: Aim 1: Conduct a comprehensive
comparative investigation into the epidemiology of disparities in rural child outcomes from life-threatening
emergencies to identify factors associated with improved outcomes & survival; Aim 2: Identify and characterize
ASEs that occur during EMS care and understand how modifiable and nonmodifiable factors magnify
or attenuate the effect of ASEs on outcomes; Aim 3: Test a new linear approach to cognitive aids to reduce
errors and promote high-quality EMS resuscitation for children. This research will be a substantive departure
from the status quo by leveraging big data approaches to move beyond high level outcome frequencies and
get to the source of what might be preventable through the health care delivery system. Errors are considered
an important source of preventable harm and potentially death. Completion of this project will result in: (i) a
novel population-based epistry on child mortality and morbidity and EMS response in rural and urban settings;
(ii) a conceptual framework of how errors contribute to preventable morbidity and mortality for rural and urban
children; and (iii) pilot data on the effectiveness of linear cognitive aids to improve the safety of EMS care and
potentially reduce disparities in rural and urban child morbidity and mortality."

10849618,"The Nutrition, Obesity and Atherosclerosis Training Program at the University of Washington is a successful
Training Program, now in its 45th year of funding. The overall goal of the program continues to be to provide a
highly qualified group of postdoctoral MD physician-scientists and PhD scientists with the research skills they
need to become fully independent investigators in the areas of nutrition, obesity and atherosclerosis. The
Training Program utilizes 32 investigators at the University of Washington who are performing basic,
population science and clinical research in these areas as preceptors. Use is also made of a number of basic
and clinical scientists with whom the core faculty collaborates, additional training opportunities provided by our
External Advisors, and institutional support to broaden research training and resources available to trainees in
the Program.
Trainees entering the Program previously have obtained either an MD or PhD degree (or both) and most MD
candidates have completed residency training. Some have had some prior research experience. PhD
candidates have demonstrated ability in a basic science or population science discipline and have
demonstrated capability for research related to the focus of this Program. Selection of the 4 candidates
supported by this training grant is made from a large pool of qualified applicants who continue to apply for
research training in nutrition, obesity and atherosclerosis at the University of Washington.
This Program provides trainees with research experience in basic- population- and clinical science necessary
in preparation for independent research careers. Appointments to the Training Program are for at least 2 years,
with an optional 3rd year available. The program also includes opportunities for trainees to obtain Master of
Public Health or Master of Science degree in the areas of nutritional sciences, epidemiology, global health, and
health systems and population health, to interact through program-specific meetings, and to present their
research to peers, preceptors, invited scientists from other academic institutions, and at national scientific
meetings. A series of didactic lectures, seminars, and journal clubs related to the topics of lipids, obesity,
nutrition and atherosclerosis, as well as in scientific methods and biomedical ethics, complement the research
training. Rigorous evaluation of trainees and preceptors is performed bi-annually and is overseen by the
Internal Advisory Committee and an External Advisory Committee.
The Nutrition, Obesity and Atherosclerosis Training Program has been highly successful in training productive
scientists, including scientists from underrepresented groups, in these areas during the current funding period,
and will provide an even stronger training environment due to several changes to increase diversity,
coherence, and training opportunities during the next funding period."
10757947,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Negative valence states can be modeled in mice using fear conditioning and reward seeking (an example of
frustrative nonreward). Such states lead to transcriptional aberrations at the level of both individual genes and
genome-wide; these changes are also sexually dimorphic. One gene of considerable interest is cyclin-dependent
kinase 5 (Cdk5). While most prior studies have focused on the mechanisms of Cdk5 protein activation and
signaling in stress-evoked behavior, we recently reported that cocaine exposure and fear conditioning lead to
transcriptional regulation of Cdk5 in male mouse brain. This proposal will directly examine the connection
between Cdk5 gene activation and Cdk5 protein activity.
Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that Cdk5-associated histone modifications correlate with drug-, and
fear-induced Cdk5 expression. The current proposal explores the functional relevance of stress-induced histone
modifications at the murine Cdk5 locus across multiple behavioral paradigms using the innovative approach of
locus-specific epigenetic editing. This approach allows us to recapitulate endogenous mechanisms of gene
expression, avoiding non-physiologically relevant changes in protein expression resulting from traditional
knockout or overexpression. Furthermore, we apply cell-type specific analyses to elucidate Cdk5 function in
brain regions across the corticostriatal-limbic circuitry in the regulation of negative valence states. This proposal
will examine the direct functional relevance of sex-specific, epigenetic regulation of Cdk5 by fear conditioning
(Aim 1) and cocaine seeking during abstinence (Aim 2) using targeted epigenetic editing. Sex- and region-
specific phosphoproteomic profiling will be applied to define relevant Cdk5 targets. Identification of the precise
transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by which stress regulates specific gene expression is critical for the
development of targeted antidepressant treatments."
10775779,"THERANOSTICS FOR PEDIATRIC BRAIN CANCER
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequently diagnosed primary malignant brain tumor in children with median
survival of less than one year. Disease recurrence is common and is caused by the presence of glioma-initiating
cells (GICs) that are unreceptive to conventional therapies, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic
options. We aim to develop a novel strategy to specifically disrupt the lifeline of GICs, without causing toxic
effects to the normal brain. The highly vascularized nature of GBMs and the critical function of the perivascular
niche for nutritional supply of GICs have spurred much interest in novel vascular-disruptive agents (VDAs).
Intravenously administered VDAs easily reach GBM vessels and do not rely on the enhanced permeability and
retention effect, which can limit the delivery of macromolecules to the tumor tissue. VDA-mediated blood vessel
disruption causes efficient drug delivery to the GIC niche and starvation of many tumor cells. In contrast to
classical anti-angiogenesis drugs, VDAs not only disrupt the tumor vasculature, but also cause significant GIC
apoptosis through direct cytotoxic effects. While being highly effective for cancer treatment, initial VDA
formulations also caused significant toxicity to the normal brain. This is particularly concerning for children, as
the developing brain is more vulnerable to toxic side effects compared to the adult brain. To solve this problem,
we developed novel VDA-loaded theranostic (combined therapeutic and diagnostic) nanoparticles, which are
specifically activated in brain tumors by matrix metalloproteinases 14 (MMP-14). The normal brain does not
express MMP-14 and therefore, does not activate the theranostic drug, thereby creating highly effective cancer
therapy without side effects. The major goal of our project is to develop MMP-14-activatable theranostic
nanoparticles (TNPs) for curative treatment of GBM, without causing toxicity to the normal brain. The
approach relies on the high prevalence of MMP-14 in GBM, a proven MMP-14-activatable prodrug strategy, and
a nanocarrier platform based on FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticles. We hypothesize that our TNPs will be
converted to an active therapeutic agent only within MMP-14-expressing tumors, releasing the therapeutic drug
azademethylcolchicine and causing significant antitumor effects. In addition, we postulate that the iron oxide
nanoparticle moiety will allow real-time monitoring of drug accumulation and localization at tumors with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). In aim 1, we will evaluate whether TNP dose and VDA payload affect VDA mediated
vascular disruption, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and cancer-specific toxicity. In aim 2, we will investigate
the link between VDA-mediated tumor microvessel disruption, microvascular endothelial cell death and GIC
death. TNPs hold the potential to substantially improving therapeutic efficacy whilst simultaneously reducing
dose-limiting toxicities. Realizing our goal will uncover new targets and mechanisms for successful GBM therapy,
eliminate or substantially reduce off-target toxicities and provide children with brain cancers with a much needed
new treatment option."
10808932,"SUMMARY
The mammalian heart forms early in embryogenesis, and defects in its formation are at the root of congenital
heart defects (CHDs), affecting 1–2% of live births. The gene regulatory networks that are disturbed in CHDs
have begun to be elucidated from large-scale human genetic studies. Many of the genes causing CHD are
transcriptional regulators, and several of these are also associated with genetics of adult heart disease, such as
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. A complete understanding of the birth of cardiac progenitors and the first steps
that lead to the formation of the embryonic heart has implications for both CHD and adult heart disease.
The origins of the heart in embryogenesis have been defined as beginning in mesoderm that arises during
gastrulation. We previously defined a specific enhancer of Smarcd3 that labels a very restricted subpopulation
of Mesp1 lineage-labeled mesoderm, which contribute almost exclusively to the heart. Embryogenesis is a highly
dynamic process, whereby complex coordinated cell movements position organ precursors for precise
morphogenesis, and control the response to potent morphogenetic signaling gradients. While aspects of dynamic
cardiac morphogenesis have been visualized in the avian embryo, our knowledge of cardiac progenitor
emergence and behaviour in the mouse embryo is lacking. We have been able to culture and image live lineage-
labeled mouse embryos, and will leverage this exciting approach to investigate mammalian cardiac development.
We hypothesize that differentiation, migration, and contribution to early heart formation of early cardiac
progenitors are regulated by a specific gene regulatory network composed of temporally-modulated DNA
regulatory elements and the coordinated function of a cascade of transcriptional regulators. We will test this
hypothesis in two Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: To define genome-wide the gene regulatory networks that control the emergence of early
cardiac progenitors. We will define genome-wide regulatory networks that control the specification, migration,
and differentiation of early cardiac precursor using transgenic reporter lines combined with single cell RNA-seq
and single cell ATACseq (for chromatin accessibility) in normal and mutant embryonic heart development
Specific Aim 2. To visualize the birth and migration of early cardiac progenitors with live embryo imaging.
In this aim, we will use live embryo light sheet microscopic imaging of lineage-labeled mouse embryos to
visualize in 4D the live dynamic emergence of cardiac progenitors, their migration, and their collective behaviours
during early cardiac morphogenesis. We will further image in live embryos in 4D early cardiac progenitors in the
context of impaired migration (Mesp1 knockout embryos) and defective differentiation of first or second heart
fields (Tbx5 and Mef2c knockout embryos).
From transcription factor footprints in the genome, to transcriptomes, to live cells in vivo, our project will elucidate
at the single cell level the molecular nature of the earliest cardiac precursors."
10770374,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the advances in our knowledge of cancer biology and the approval of new cancer drugs by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), very few patients with solid tumors that have spread to distant sites
(metastases) are cured of their disease. This is true of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). Consequently,
substantial research is directed toward identifying new targets and treatments.
 New technologies which we and others have developed, now provide unprecedented approaches for
deeply characterizing tumors on a comprehensive scale. Studies using these approaches have determined
that mPC is comprised of multiple distinct subtypes – a subset of these are defined by specific genomic
alterations in oncogenes and genes that normally function to suppress tumor growth. Others are defined by the
phenotype – characteristics that influence function and behavior. Notably, a number of these subtypes are now
known to have different vulnerabilities to particular therapies – knowledge that underlies a more precision
approach for treatment. However, for most subtypes we do not currently have knowledge of their particular
vulnerabilities nor do we have therapeutics that can halt their growth/progression.
 Powerful high-throughput approaches to dissect the function of every gene in a particular cancer genome
have been deployed to construct cancer dependency maps (DEPMAP) in many cancer types. These
approaches are highly ‘discovery driven’ as they approach the problem of identifying cancer vulnerabilities in a
systematic rather than hypothesis-driven fashion. However, prostate cancer is largely excluded from these
International projects due to the very limited number of mPC models available to conduct these large scale
experiments.
 In this proposal, we aim to identify new treatment avenues for advanced lethal prostate cancer. We will use
multiple new models of metastatic prostate cancer that we have developed and characterized to identify PC
subtype specific dependencies using genome-wide loss-of-function screens. In parallel, we will evaluate
growth inhibitory effects of drug libraries of approved agents as well as compounds in development.
Combinations of agents that exploit genomic dependencies will be tested in vivo against a panel of patient
derived xenograft (PDX) lines with and without the predicted vulnerability."
10756524,"Abstract
Colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and worldwide. Colonoscopy is the
preferred screening method at an estimated annual cost of about $24 billion in the US. Unfortunately, many
lesions are missed because they can remain hidden from view behind folds and flexures of the colon. Current
methods of increasing the field of view are ineffective and some are very expensive, preventing the adoption of
these methods into clinical practice.
In this proposal, we propose to develop a single viewpoint panoramic imaging technology which can provide
360-degree side-view of the colon. The proposed panoramic imaging system consists of an array of imaging
systems which share the same viewpoint, addressing the key barrier in reconstructing the panoramic image from
multiple imaging systems. We will develop a unique monolithic opto-mechanical design to integrate all
subsystems precisely without active alignment. The proposed single viewpoint panoramic imaging system can
be either integrated to the new colonoscope so that the colonoscope will have standard forward view and 360-
degree panoramic side-view, or built as a snap-on attachment for the current commercial colonoscopes to
provide 360-degree panoramic side-view.
To demonstrate the imaging capability of the proposed single viewpoint panoramic system, we will first develop
and characterize a single viewpoint panoramic attachment for the standard colonoscope, and then evaluate the
performance in detecting polyps and compare to a standard colonoscope.
The proposed single viewpoint panoramic imaging system will maximize the detection of polyps and substantially
reduce the incidence of colon cancer. It will benefit the patients and society in five-fold: reducing incidence of
colon cancer, reducing the chance of ‘interval’ cancer, decreasing overall morbidity and mortality, increasing the
interval between colonoscopies, and reducing the economic burden of this disease."
10756143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses with few effective evidence-based treatments and there is little
mechanistic understanding of the neuropsychological impairments underlie both illness and recovery. We have
previously identified differences in the neural circuits that process social behaviors in both adolescent and adult
women recovering from anorexia nervosa. However, a better understanding of the relationships between social
perceptions and clinical symptoms requires understanding this illness in individuals early in their course of the
disease and examination of these processes over time as recovery progresses. This pilot exploratory project will
examine adolescent women seeking treatment for anorexia nervosa both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
Comparison data from age-matched healthy controls will be collected. To maximize data, computer administered
behavioral versions of well-characterized neuroimaging tasks assessing self-concept and social decisions will
be utilized, allowing the entire study to be completed virtually. Two sites will recruit participants: Children’s
Medical Center Eating Disorder Program at UTSW and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The
ability to conduct virtual assessments and tasks allows inclusion of 120 adolescent women (60 with anorexia
nervosa and 60 healthy controls) at three time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months), in the short time frame
of an R21. Aim 1 of this exploratory pilot project evaluates cognitive differences in self-concept while Aim 2
examines behavioral differences in social interactions. Within each aim, the social metrics obtained will be
evaluated with regard to group differences and their relation to current clinical symptoms. An exploratory
hypothesis within each aim will consider whether changes in clinical state are related to social metrics. At the
conclusion of this pilot project, we will have a better understanding of which components of self-concept and
social decisions differ in adolescents with anorexia nervosa and how these constructs are related to
psychopathology."
10746853,"Project Summary. There are no efficacious therapies available to halt or reverse AD progression, which is
attributed, at least in part, to the lack of translational molecular imaging tools suitable for both preclinical disease
models and humans to facilitate drug discovery and development. Therefore, the development of such tools for
non-invasive assessment of AD progression and therapeutic efficacy hold promises to fill the gap of this urgent
and unmet medical need.
 Chronic neuroinflammation has demonstrated a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. As such, activated
microglia release high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that prompt the release of excessive glutamate from
adjacent astrocytes. The resulting glutamate spillover activates extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors (NMDARs), thereby leading to the loss of synaptic integrity and neuronal cell death. As a primary
contributor to this process, the GluN2B subunit is enriched in detrimental extrasynaptic NMDARs, which
represents a promising target for monitoring glutamate-triggered neurotoxicity in AD. Our strategy involves the
use of a specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [11C]Me-NB1, that targets GluN2B-carrying
NMDARs. To date, [11C]Me-NB1 is the only GluN2B PET tracer that has been successfully validated in small
animals and healthy humans. Preliminary studies have shown that [11C]Me-NB1-PET is highly suited for non-
invasive mapping of the GluN2B subunit, with excellent target affinity and selectivity across different species.
However, non-invasive assessment of the distribution and expression of GluN2B has not yet been conducted in
AD and the availability of [11C]Me-NB1 now provides new opportunity to fill this fundamental knowledge gap.
Accordingly, our proposed study will lay the foundation for an appropriately designed clinical study with AD
patients and age-matched healthy volunteers using [11C]Me-NB1-PET in the subsequent R01 application. As our
specific objectives, utilizing non-invasive [11C]Me-NB1-PET, we propose to directly monitor GluN2B changes in
AD models and evaluate treatment response for novel microglia-modulating therapy in transgenic APP/PS1
mouse models. Following this, our long-term goal is to assess the utility of [11C]Me-NB1-PET as a translational
molecular imaging tool to provide new information (neuroimmune function and NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity)
of AD pathophysiology, and to enable target engagement and evaluate treatment response in clinical trials of
novel AD drugs."
10789880,"Project Summary/Abstract
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects over 12 million people worldwide. Available
therapies provide only a slight delay in ongoing growth of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney and liver that progress
to kidney failure and in some cases devastating pain and abdominal distension. Approximately one third of
ADPKD patients have non-truncating mutations in the primary disease gene PKD1/Polycystin-1(PC1). A
significant subset of these encode a version of PC1 that fails to mature to its site of action at the cell surface
yet may be an at least partially functional PC1 protein. PC1 “dosage”—the functional amount of PC1 protein at
its site of action—correlates with disease severity. Nonetheless, feasible approaches to increase PC1 dosage
had not previously been identified to evaluate therapeutically.
We have contributed to the identification and characterization of several disease genes that encode proteins in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are necessary for PC1 maturation. Patients with mutations in these genes
also get kidney and liver cyst due to insufficient PC1 dosage, and many are in desperate need of treatmentsIn
mouse models for these genes, increasing PC1 production by increasing a mouse’s genomic copy number of
Pkd1 provides a striking rescue of cyst formation. We hypothesize that increasing PC1 protein expression
in patients with mutations in these ER genes and in a substantial subset of patients with PKD1 non-
truncating mutations will dramatically reduce cyst burden.
We have identified, with supportive preliminary data, that the 5’ untranslated region of human PKD1 contains
likely highly relevant upstream open reading frames (uORFs). uORF translation distracts ribosomes away from
translating the intended protein. Our data suggests that blocking PKD1 uORF translation would produce a many-
fold increase in translation of PC1. Blocking uORF translation is achievable as a clinical therapy using antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO). ASOs are approved therapies for other diseases. For this proposal we will test and
characterize the effect of abolishing human PKD1 uORF translation to increase PC1 expression and
generate in vivo models for preclinical evaluation of this treatment on cystic disease severity. For our
first aim we will evaluate two independent approaches in vitro: (1) edit uORF initiation codon sequence in the
human PKD1 5’UTR using CRISPR to test the effect of uORF translation on PC1 expression, and (2) test and
optimize ASOs to characterize the effect of steric inhibition of uORF translation and RNA secondary structure
on PC1 expression. For aim 2 we will use CRISPR to humanize the 5’UTR of our epitope-tagged Pkd1-V5 mouse
with or without uORF initiation codon edits. We will test the benefit of abolished uORFs to have a clinically
meaningful effect on cyst formation and severity in our PC1 dosage-dependent mouse models and optimize
models to evaluate for preclinical therapies."
10795844,"With advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer, are more likely to
die from non-AIDS-related causes, and are less likely to die from AIDS-related complications. In fact, lung cancer
is now the leading cause of cancer death among PLWH. Tobacco use is a major contributing factor to lung
cancer incidence and mortality among PLWH since smoking rates among PLWH are approximately 40-50%.
Indeed, this is more than double or triple the 15.5% rate of smoking in the general United States population. With
several evidence-based tobacco treatment approaches at the patients' disposal, including pharmacotherapy and
behavioral counseling, optimizing how those treatments are delivered to patients requires an empirical approach.
Routine clinical care through the healthcare system may not be optimized to reach this patient population. Prior
research has shown that proactive tobacco treatment increases the likelihood of treatment engagement and
downstream cessation. Beyond the method for engaging in the initial contact session, prior studies have
demonstrated that there are optimal ways for framing how the tobacco treatment is being provided. That is,
presenting smoking cessation in an opt-out fashion results in increased patient reach and likelihood of
abstinence. Despite the evidence in support of a proactive, opt-out method for smoking cessation intervention
delivery, this strategy has not been evaluated in the context of tobacco treatment for PLWH. Further, because
this approach can connect patients with available, evidence-based interventions that can be delivered remotely,
it holds promise for implementation in the context of healthcare settings across the country. In the proposed
study, we will conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the impact of a proactive,
opt-out smoking cessation intervention on smoking cessation outcomes and advance understanding of key
barriers and facilitators of implementation processes. We propose a comparison of Treatment As Usual [TAU;
reactive, opt-in smoking cessation treatment delivered through Infectious Diseases clinical pathways] to
Proactive Outreach with Medication Opt-out for Tobacco Treatment Engagement (PrOMOTE) and
characterization of key determinants of PrOMOTE implementation outcomes. The intervention will consist of a
tobacco treatment specialist proactively and remotely contacting a patient to assess smoking status, provide a
brief motivational interview and counseling, and provide a mail-order prescription for varenicline (or dual NRT if
indicated) in an opt-out fashion. This proposed study will examine this novel approach to optimizing delivery of
smoking cessation care for PLWH. Integrating effectiveness and implementation results will help define best
practices for engaging PLWH with existing evidence-based smoking cessation interventions. This hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial presents on opportunity to optimize tobacco treatment delivery, and identify
barriers and facilitators towards future implementation and dissemination to ambulatory HIV clinics across the
country."
10805514,"Acinetobacter baumannii is listed by the CDC as a clinical pathogen that poses a serious antibiotic resistance
threat in the United States, due to its resistance to the last resort carbapenem antibiotics (carbapenem-resistant
A. baumannii or CRAb), which were the drugs of choice for treatment of infections caused by this microorganism.
In addition, CRAb is often resistant to antimicrobial agents of different classes (multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii
or MDRAb), which severely limits available therapeutic options. The major mechanism of resistance of A.
baumannii to carbapenems is production of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes, carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-
lactamases or CHDLs. In addition, carbapenemases of classes A and B, sensitivity of carbapenem targets
(bacterial penicillin-binding proteins or PBPs), rates of antibiotic penetration into the bacterial cell and their
expulsion by efflux pumps can also contribute to resistance. Levels of resistance to carbapenems reach up to
90% in some parts of the world, and mortality rates from infections caused by such bacteria are staggeringly
high, up to 50%. Our long-term goal is to develop novel antibiotics for treatment of deadly MDRAb infections.
Over the last decade, the Vakulenko group has performed in-depth characterization of clinically important
CHDLs, which provides guidance for development of a new generation of carbapenems capable of inhibiting
these enzymes. Concurrently, Dr. John Buynak’s (co-PI) group developed dozens of novel atypically-modified
carbapenem antibiotics. We evaluated these antibiotics for their activity against MDRAb and demonstrated that
three of them possess superior activity (when compared to commercial carbapenems) against MDRAb. All three
inhibited the most prevalent A. baumannii CHDL, OXA-23, and had varying spectra of inhibitory activity against
other CHDLs and carbapenemases of other classes. One of these compounds had an unprecedented wide
spectrum of activity and resisted hydrolysis by a wide range of clinically important carbapenemases of all
molecular classes. In this grant application, we propose to perform detailed characterization of our novel
carbapenem antibiotics. We will determine activity of our compounds against A. baumannii strains expressing
major CHDLs and other carbapenemases and unveil kinetic and structural features responsible for their ability
to inhibit these enzymes (Aim 1). We will study interaction of our novel carbapenems with their targets, PBPs,
and determine to what extent efflux pumps and porins influence bacterial resistance to these antibiotics (Aim 2).
We will design and characterize several dozen novel carbapenem antibiotics to further improve their antimicrobial
activity by enhancing their inhibitory potency against various carbapenemases, improving affinity for PBPs and
increasing penetration rates and resistance to efflux (Aim 3). We will perform in vitro characterization of our best
novel carbapenems to assess their solubility, stability and toxicity. Finally, our best compounds will be evaluated
in animal studies to appreciate their potential as novel therapeutic agents against MDRAb (Aim 4)."

Since the introduction of chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood leukemia more than 60 years ago, the
prognosis of childhood cancer has improved dramatically. The overall 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers,
many of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now 84%. Progress for a number of childhood
cancers, however, has been limited, with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50%
of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing
to their disease. In the US, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children greater than one
year of age. Moreover, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage,
hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the
estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health related quality of life
complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. Thus, despite our advances, development of new
therapeutic approaches must be a priority for childhood cancer basic, translational and clinical researchers. The
Children's Oncology Group (COG), the world's largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and
adolescent cancer research, was founded 17 years ago. The COG's multidisciplinary research team, comprised
of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children's hospitals, universities, and
cancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) National Clinical Trials
Network (NCTN), to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome
for all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer
that builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest
potential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases,
we will study novel therapeutic approaches including but not limited to targeted small molecule drugs,
immunotherapies and cellular therapies. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes clinical trials
focused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. As more than 90% of children
diagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer a
diverse population of children with cancer and their families the opportunity to participate in innovative research.
This research effort includes allowing for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer,
providing the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in
laboratories around the world. The proposal is for support of the COG Network Operations Center, clinician-
scientists who develop and conduct research, and for member sites to participate through enrollment of eligible
subjects."

Impairment of articular cartilage function after injury and disease like osteoarthritis (OA), remains a major health
problem. One of the major drawbacks of tissue engineering-based therapies for damaged joint articular cartilage
is that the cartilaginous repair tissue formed by implanted mesenchymal stromal cells or endogenous progenitors
does not resemble articular cartilage, likely due to fibrochondrogenesis and the endochondral ossification
process. Joint cartilage is generated during embryogenesis by specialized GDF5+ cells called ‘interzone’ cells or
‘joint progenitors’. They are distinct from progenitors that give rise to growth plate chondrocytes. In this proposal,
we aim to define the molecular targets that control articular-like permanent chondrocyte formation versus growth
plate-like transient chondrocyte formation, by using novel GDF5+ mesenchymal cells developed from human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). During in vitro chondrogenesis, such cells express signs of primitive (or
embryonic) articular chondrocytes but not of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Significantly, after transplantation of the
cartilage they develop, no mineralization was observed for 8 weeks (i.e., permanent cartilage). Therefore, the
hPSC-derived GDF5+ cells may share the activity of joint progenitors, although genome-wide RNA-sequencing
(seq) analyses suggested association with developing tenocytes or ligamentocytes. In contrast, alternative
hPSC-derived chondroprogenitors, SOX9+ cells, generated cartilage that readily underwent complete
mineralization, mimicking growth-plate chondroprogenitors. Interestingly, when mixed with GDF5+ cells, the
SOX9+ cell-derived cartilage behaved as permanent cartilage in a GDF5+ cell-dose-dependent manner,
suggesting the involvement of a non-cell autonomous mechanism. Therefore, we first propose to test if the
GDF5+ cells have a joint progenitor-like activity, characterize the (permanent) cartilage developed from them,
and shed lights on how the cells generate permanent cartilage (Aim 1). Second, we plan to identify genes
potentially involved in permanent cartilage formation from GDF5+ cells through comparative RNA-seq analyses
of cartilage pellets developed from the GDF5+ and SOX9+ cells (Aim 2). We will then functionally validate the
candidate genes (and their encoded proteins, inhibitors and activators if commercially available) for their ability
to enable SOX9+ cells to generate articular-like permanent chondrocytes using gene knockout and
overexpression techniques (Aim 3). We will then examine whether GDF5+ cells and such gene-modified SOX9+
cells induce more sustained repair of damaged joint cartilage than SOX9+ cells (Aim 4). Lastly, any of the genes
defined in these studies will be manipulated similarly in therapeutically relevant adult mesenchymal stromal cells
to confirm that targeting the same mechanisms will convert the adult stem cells to articular cartilage-forming cells
(Aim 4). Thus, success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic insights into how articular-like
permanent cartilage can be selectively formed from various chondrogenic cells, potentially leading to novel
therapeutic strategies for effective, sustained repair of damaged cartilage."

glucose-lowering medications from classes that differ in their mechanisms of action.
Variability in treatment efficacy may be due to genetic variation, but data are needed to
guide specific pharmacotherapy addressing the pathogenic mechanisms affecting an
individual patient. The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative
Effectiveness (GRADE) Study is evaluating the effectiveness of each of the four most
commonly employed glucose-lowering medications (sulfonylurea, GLP-1 receptor
agonist, DPP-4 inhibitor, basal insulin) added to a background of metformin. Among
5,047 randomized participants, 4,730 have consented to genetic analyses. We propose
to use a genome-wide association approach to test 1) whether specific genomic regions
or polygenic scores associate with the glycemic response to each of the four drugs, or to
a specific mode of action; 2) whether specific genomic regions or polygenic scores
associate with key intermediate traits of glucose homeostasis (e.g. insulin sensitivity, β-
cell function), or the occurrence of side effects and diabetes complications; 3) in a
subset of 1,600 participants with available DNA who have undergone continuous
glucose monitoring, whether specific genomic regions or polygenic scores associate with
the mismatch between glycated hemoglobin and average glycemia, or with glycemic
variability while on each drug; and 4) whether variants known to be associated with type
2 diabetes or related traits, polygenic scores constructed from such variants, or
physiology-driven partitioned genetic scores, are associated with response to each of
the four agents employed in GRADE. This proposal represents a full pharmacogenetic
exploration in the GRADE clinical trial designed to advance precision medicine in type 2
diabetes."

The Mouse Metabolic Physiology Core and its two subcores, the Metabolic Regulation Subcore and the Body
Weight Regulation Subcore, provide investigators both guidance on experimental design and use of state-of-
the-art techniques to assess genetic and environmental determinants of insulin action, substrate metabolism,
and energy balance in vivo. The experienced faculty and highly skilled staff of this Core have a 20-year history
of performing complex procedures to study metabolism in healthy, unstressed mice and have been at the
forefront of development, standardization, implementation, and dissemination of new concepts and techniques
to study mouse models of metabolic diseases. In the present application, the Mouse Metabolic Physiology
Core delivers critically needed mouse-related services to investigators outside of Vanderbilt. Skilled mouse
surgeons perform difficult surgeries such as catheter, brain cannula, and brain probe implantations, as well as
bariatric surgery and islet transplantation. Experienced staff perform complex experiments such as metabolic
flux analyses under conditions such as those created by a glucose clamp or exercise. Measurements of energy
balance components and assessment of reward/motivated behavior allow for the physiological and behavioral
determinants of body weight to be determined in mouse models of metabolic disease. This Core merges
techniques so that oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, energy expenditure, activity and feeding behavior are
measured simultaneously with studies of metabolism using indwelling catheters or neural regulation using
implanted cannula and fiber optic probes. Experience at Vanderbilt over the past 5 years predicts robust use of
this Core. The Mouse Metabolic Physiology Core participates in important educational programs for the
diabetes community, including a weeklong course that has been given 20 times over 19 years focusing on
surgical and experimental techniques necessary to perform glucose clamps in mice. This Core supports the

10772056,"National Center for Metabolic Phenotyping in Live Models of Obesity and Diabetes (MPMOD)
 at UC Davis
ABSTRACT—OVERALL SECTION
 According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than a third of U.S. adults are obese, suffer related
complications (e.g., heart disease, stroke, cancer), and cost the US economy more than $150 billion annually.
And the facts don’t stop there: recent data from the CDC reveal an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes,
reaching a prevalence of ~11% of the US adult population today. Genetics, environmental factors, food and
physical activity behaviors, chronic stress, and coincident high-risk morbidities all point to diabetes and obesity
being diseases of heterogenic origin. In this context, advanced research to comprehensively phenotype better
mouse models relevant to the human condition is especially needed to fully understand disease pathogenesis
and mechanisms to inform strategies for curbing this rising epidemic.
 Translational research in vivo using genetic, surgical, humanized, and other types of mouse models are
needed especially now to characterize disease pathogenesis, mechanisms, and consequences. These models
need to be relevant to the pathophysiology of human metabolic disease so as to inform more effective
diagnostic, therapeutic, and prevention strategies. To catalyze this effort and accelerate progress toward these
goals, UC Davis proposes the creation of a National Center for Metabolic Phenotyping of Mouse Models of
Obesity and Diabetes (MPMOD). The Center will provide the diabetes and obesity research communities
access to specialized and advanced resources to assess mouse models employing unique, complex, and
hard-to-find tests and procedures. MPMOD users will also be connected to competent, experienced, and
expert consultation and advice on experimental design, test selection, outcomes measures, and interpretation.
 The UC Davis MPMOD team has a solid foundation of service to the research community: for the last 10
years, UC Davis served as a flagship in the NIDDK Metabolic Mouse Phenotyping Center (MMPC)
Consortium, providing in vivo services on live mice and in vitro analyses on murine tissue and plasma and
serum to the greater research community. The MPMOD Center at UC Davis will build from those successes
and our strong infrastructure to offer many novel and innovative approaches to tackle new questions in live
mice, drawing upon the larger UC Davis scientific enterprise and core labs to provide the research community
with high quality metabolic, physiologic, and behavioral phenotyping services in vivo to characterize the
heterogeneity, pathogenesis, and consequences of diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders.
 The MPMOD Center at UC Davis will consist of an Administrative Core providing administrative, service,
and business oversight for the Center; an Animal Core that will import and provide husbandry, care, and
numerous special services (e.g., SPF husbandry, gnotobiotic mouse management, ABSL3 conditions,
microsurgery capability, necropsy and histopathology) for mice submitted to the Center; a Metabolism and
Metabolic Health Core with significant resources and expertise to offer well-established metabolic phenotyping
tests plus innovative approaches (e.g., PET imaging, continuous glucose monitoring, sophisticated energy
balance measures, xenometabolomics) to reveal subtle shifts in macronutrient metabolism, energy intake and
feeding behaviors, energy expenditure and metabolic efficiency; and a Physiology and Behavior Core with
substantial breadth and depth of expertise and capabilities to provide in-depth assessments of organ and
whole-animal physiology (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory, ocular, and neurological) and
neurobehavioral assessment of exercise behavior, sleep, learning and memory, anxiety, depression and
stress, and motor function relevant to diabetes and obesity. Each of the Cores will have a Scientific Leader and
co-Leader, Core Coordinator, and Technical Specialists to conduct experiments. Numerous Scientific
Consultants affiliated with each Core will be available to offer expert advice on experimental design, test
selection, and data interpretation, and provide novel and complex tests and procedures upon request.
 In addition to comprehensive tests and consultation, a major strength of the MPMOD Center at UC Davis
will be a close association with internationally recognized assets for production and sharing of novel mouse
disease models. Scientists can of course send in their own mice for testing, but in addition they can order a
mouse model of diabetes or obesity from a repository (e.g., the UC Davis MMRRC, KOMP2 programs) or have
the Center make a relevant mouse model de novo (e.g., genetically-altered, bariatric surgery model) for them.
 Services will be offered at reasonable cost to all users who will be afforded equal service priority whether
from inside UC Davis or an outside institution. The Center will reinvest program income to develop new testing
technologies, fund collaborative projects, support fee waivers, and subsidize pilot and feasibility studies. The
Center intends to be an active and engaged member of the MPMOD Consortium by participating in shared
governance of the national MPMOD Program and by providing complementary services to avoid costly and
inefficient overlap between other MPMOD Centers. Finally, the Center will be an active participant in the
MPMOD Vibrant Program and has proposed an innovative partnership between MPMOD Centers and
Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the 23-campus California State University (CSU) system."
10819551,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Respiratory diseases are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite that vaccines 
are available, the CDC recognizes Whooping cough as a reemerging infectious disease that kills hundreds of 
thousands of babies and children each year, both in developed and underdeveloped countries. Unfortunately, 
the failure to control Whooping cough is not an isolated phenomenon, as a similar lack of protection is seen with 
other respiratory pathogens, such as pneumococcus. Common to most vaccines strategies against respiratory 
bacterial diseases is a focus on the generation of antibody responses, which overlooks roles for T cells and 
mucosal immunity in producing durable protective responses. Eosinophils are a type of immune cell that is known 
to play pivotal roles in protection against infection by parasitic helminths (worms), indicating a function in the 
overall immune response to pathogens. Recent studies reveal that eosinophils play important roles in adaptive 
cellular immune responses by coordinating T and B cell responses in the gastric mucosa, and in maintenance 
of mucosal homeostasis. This project will make use of Bordetella bronchiseptica infection of mice, a tractable 
small animal model for Whooping cough, to investigate the role of eosinophils as drivers of the T cell responses 
in respiratory bacterial infections. Our preliminary data indicate that eosinophils are required for clearance of 
Bordetella bronchiseptica from the mouse respiratory tract. Moreover, mice lacking eosinophils present with a 
persistent infection, fail to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, and are unable to generate effective antibody 
responses, suggesting that eosinophils promote adaptive immunity. Completion of the proposed studies will 
improve our understanding of eosinophil biology and the mechanisms eosinophils use to drive T cell responses. 
We anticipate that the knowledge gained from our work will identify novel targets for the development of improved 
vaccines against Whooping cough and possibly other diseases caused by respiratory pathogens."

10784694,"DEVELOPMENTAL CORE ABSRACT
HIV has the highest prevalence in the US among marginalized populations, including African-American and
Latinx communities as well as sexual and gender diverse individuals. Therefore, ending the US epidemic will
require innovative research to inform services that can reach the most marginalized populations. One way to
achieve this is to ensure that individuals from groups underrepresented in science enter the pipeline for career
development. Methodologically strong investigators from diverse communities are necessary to expand research
and community networks and implement innovative and effective interventions to address co-morbid mental
health problems and HIV. In addition, they must possess cultural fluency and an intimate understanding of what
makes programs sustainable locally. In an innovative response to these needs, the University of Washington
(UW) Developmental AIDS Research Center (D-ARC) Developmental Core team aims to 1) Attract, engage, and
support a diverse set of early stage investigators (ESI) in mental health and HIV research and 2) Enhance the
mentoring skills of mental health and HIV researchers to promote a nurturing environment for ESI. Culturally
informed mentorship is essential to increasing the quantity and diversity of investigators for the HIV behavioral
research workforce. Thus, we will use an established Mentoring the Mentors (MtM) curriculum for ongoing
cohorts of US and sub-Saharan African mentors. The Core will leverage existing strengths and institutional
support at UW, including from the UW/Fred Hutch CFAR (which has generously provided four 2-year New
Investigator Awards for mental health and HIV, to supplement the Core’s ten 2-year Synergistic Pilot ARC
[SPARC] awards and eight Travel Awards). The Core will connect ESI with mentors from an extensive network
of UW investigators with relevant methodological and implementation science expertise and strengthen access
to NIH-funded centers (e.g., ALACRITY), NIAID-funded clinical trial networks (e.g., HPTN, HVTN, IMPAACT,
MTN), and the NIMH-funded U19 Scale-Up Hub Networks. Finally, the Core will leverage UW graduate school
offerings, e-learning methods courses, and global trainings in state-of-the-art implementation science. Overall,
the Core will add value by synergizing local expertise in mental health and HIV to develop a diverse group of
independent scholars and supportive mentors, each capable of conducting the rigorous, innovative science
needed to end the HIV epidemic."
10784698,"INTEGRATED CARE CORE ABSTRACT
Meta-analyses have established the efficacy of a broad range of treatments for common mental disorders (such
as depression, anxiety and PTSD). Moreover, the feasibility of integrating efficacious mental health services and
HIV prevention and treatment has been demonstrated, with integration shown to be an efficient strategy for
increasing access to effective mental health care and improving HIV outcomes. However, evidence-based
mental health treatments are not typically available as part of routine HIV prevention and treatment services,
compromising both mental health and HIV outcomes. The Integrated Care (IC) Core of the UW D-ARC aims to
help bridge this “know-do” gap so that mental health treatments shown to be effective in research trials are
actually delivered to people living with or at risk for HIV. IC Core efforts will be guided by an Institute of Medicine
framework for establishing the evidence base of psychosocial interventions (IOM). The Core leverages unique
strengths in (a) integrated care at the UW Departments of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences and Global Health
and (b) HIV research and services available through the UW/Fred Hutch CFAR and two federally funded
education and training centers that provide technical assistance to a large group of local, regional and global
HIV care providers. Led by a diverse, multidisciplinary team, the IC Core will unite regional and global HIV care
providers with UW researchers to generate research aligning with the IOM framework and bridging the gap
between research and practice. The Core features innovative strategies to engage community partners (peer-
to-peer learning networks), provide expert consultation on research proposals (Idea Development Workshops),
and disseminate new findings (annual writing workshops as well as publications and webinars coordinated with
the Mental Health Innovation Network). The Core will award two Community-Centered Pilot AIDS Research
Center (C-PARC) grants to partnerships between UW faculty and HIV care provider organizations to incentivize
collaborations. By supporting the development of new researchers and new collaborations between researchers
and HIV care partners both local and global, the Core aims to establish an infrastructure for ongoing and
meaningful engagement of community partners in research that will lead to impactful, innovative research and,
ultimately, accelerate an end to the HIV epidemic."
10784703,"METHODS CORE ABSTRACT
Timely support for research design, measurement, statistics, data visualization, and results presentation is
essential to ensuring the rigor and reproducibility of D-ARC research and driving scientific innovations. Led by
an interdisciplinary team of methodological experts with extensive mentoring and consulting experience, the
Methods Core will support a broad range of behavioral research in support of the D-ARC's mission in clinical
and translational science. Core Faculty will consult with D-ARC investigators and their collaborators on research
methodology across the stages of research, from research planning for a grant, to data collection and analysis,
to the presentation and discussion of results. In addition to their need for standard statistical support,
investigators are challenged by advances in data collection and statistical models leading to ever more complex
data sets and planned analyses; this is especially true for early-stage investigators (ESI). Important recent
advances include the management and analysis of dense data resulting from smartphones and wearable
devices; adaptive intervention strategies; causal inference for non-randomized interventions; latent variable
models capturing and summarizing complex patterns of behavior; nuanced longitudinal models that highlight
typical patterns of change as well as variability in patterns of change over time, and the challenges posed by
implementing and scaling interventions. Planning such research, as well as analyzing and communicating the
results, requires the involvement of expert analytic investigators. The Methods Core Faculty are well equipped
to handle these complex types of data, in addition to providing more fundamental statistics support. The aims of
the D-ARC Methods Core are to 1) Improve the methodological quality, range, and rigor of behavioral research
in mental health and HIV through tailored consultations with D-ARC investigators; 2) Deepen the methodological
expertise of D-ARC investigators by offering a quantitatively focused Junior Investigator Group (JIG-Quant) to
ESI and funding targeted workshops and visiting scholars on cutting-edge methods; and 3) Stimulate new
collaborations among Core Faculty and other experts to propel research on innovative behavioral methods,
incentivized by two pilot awards. The Core adds value to the UW research enterprise by contributing to the
development of the Next Generation of independent investigators and the creation and application of innovative,
rigorous, and reproducible methods. Growing the research workforce and supporting improvements and
innovations in methodology will lead to superior science, ultimately exerting a greater impact on the co-occurring
mental health and HIV epidemics."
10773092,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall hypothesis of this project is that regular physical exercise in mothers is critical for the prevention of
type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease in offspring. Our mouse studies establish that maternal exercise before
and during pregnancy has striking beneficial effects on the metabolic health of both male and female offspring.
These findings have opened a new area of exercise physiology research, suggesting that exercise is an
important tool to combat the development of type 2 diabetes, and underscores the need for scientific
investigation aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms by which maternal exercise improves metabolic
health of offspring. For this purpose, and based on our extensive published and preliminary data, we have
defined four Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and TGF2 as central
mediators of maternal exercise effects on offspring metabolic health in liver, skeletal muscle, and other
offspring tissues. This includes experiments that will: a) determine the function of VDR in maternal exercise-
induced hepatic, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue AMPK/TET signaling, epigenetic changes, and in vivo
glucose homeostasis; b) investigate TGF2 as a maternally derived exercise signal that activates epigenetic
changes and improves offspring phenotype; and c) determine if maternal exercise has wide ranging effects to
improve the function of skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Specific Aim 2 will determine optimal exercise and
pharmacologic treatments for the improvement of offspring metabolic health. This includes experiments to
define: a) optimal maternal exercise protocols to improve metabolic health; and b) pharmacologic activators
that mimic the beneficial effects of maternal exercise on offspring health. Specific Aim 3 is to identify and
determine the function of novel exercise regulated placental proteins that improve the metabolic health of
offspring, as our initial findings established that placenta is central to transmitting the effects of maternal
exercise to offspring. Aim 3 experiments include: a) investigation of novel placental secretory proteins
increased by maternal exercise; b) fetal tissue destination of these proteins; and c) investigating maternal
exercise effects on placenta spatial and single cell transcriptomics. We have recently made the exciting
discovery that grandmaternal exercise improves the metabolic health of second generation (F2) offspring in
adulthood. Specific Aim 4 will determine the mechanisms by which grandmaternal exercise training enhances
F2 offspring health. This will include investigating: a) maternal exercise effects on F1 sperm and oocytes; b)
mechanisms for improved glucose tolerance in F2 offspring, including studies of skeletal muscle glucose
uptake; and c) effects of grandmaternal exercise on epigenetic regulation of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose
tissue in F2. This emerging area of exercise physiology research has great potential to advance world health
by understanding mechanisms by which exercise during female reproductive years may limit the vicious cycles
of increased metabolic risk across multiple generations."
10817236,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Effective treatment is an unmet and urgent need for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC). PDAC is characterized by mutations of the KRAS gene, which occurs in >95% of cases.
However, targeting KRAS and its downstream signaling pathways, particularly the RAF-MEK-ERK
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been clinically unsuccessful due to rapid
emergence of escape mechanism including autophagy. In this study, we made novel observation that
MAPK inhibition (MAPKi) results in rapid and dramatic secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF),
which we found mediates both cell survival and death. Selective targeting of the pro-survival MAPKAPK2
(MK2) downstream f TNF signaling augments MAPKi-induced autophagy and cell death. To rigorously
study these aspects, we have developed a 3-dimensional co-culture system to show that the anti-tumor
effect of combined ERK and MK2 inhibitors is powerful enough to overcome the protection provided by
adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and kill PDAC cells. We made observations that targeting
MK2 induces favorable immunological changes that could potentiate checkpoint immunotherapy.
The overarching goal of our proposal is to perform deeper and more comprehensive mechanistic studies
to support development of novel therapeutic combinations that can be delivered to PDAC patients as
clinical trials. To achieve this goal, we propose the following three Aims:
 1. Aim 1: We will study the role of MK2 in autophagy in PDAC and CAFs using a new 3D spheroid
 culture system. We will determine the mechanism by which MAPKi-induces autophagy.
 Furthermore, we will identify new interacting partners of MK2 through a novel proteomic approach.
 2. Aim 2: We will develop new genetic mouse models with conditional MK2-deletion to
 systematically dissect the role of MK2 in different cell types in PDAC progression and shaping the
 tumor microenvironment.
 3. Aim 3: We will assess the combination of MK2 plus MAPKi and chemotherapy using a repertoire
 of thirty patient-derived xenograft models. We will perform additional studies using state-of-the art
 techniques and mouse models to develop novel immunotherapy regimens that will be rigorously
tested."
10833468,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromatin-based DNA damage response (DDR) pathway is fundamental for protecting cells from genome
instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. The DDR pathway is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle to ensure
spatiotemporal control of DNA repair. Cell cycle-regulated chromatin modification is crucial for orchestrating DNA
repair. Notably, H4K20 methylation is a cell cycle-dependent histone mark that is involved in DNA double-strand
break (DSB) repair pathway choice. Newly incorporated unmodified H4 recruits TONSL to replicated damaged
chromatin to execute homologous recombination (HR) repair; whereas, H4K20me2 recruits 53BP1 to damaged
chromatin predominately at G1 phase to promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The knowledge gap for
the current model comes from the unclear role and regulation of H4K20me1 and DSB repair pathway choice.
Identifying histone H4K20me readers provides important insights into how chromatin modifications execute
cellular functions by recruiting downstream effector proteins to damaged chromatin at the right time. We identified
ZMYM3 (Zinc finger myeloproliferative and mental retardation, type-3), as an HR promoting factor, which
specifically binds to the H4K20 methylation mark. The overall objective of this project is to elucidate the
mechanistic regulatory role of ZMYM3 on cell cycle-regulated H4K20 methylation, and how it translates into DNA
DSBs repair pathway choice on post-replicative chromatin. Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the
connection between ZMYM3 and H4K20 methylation by biochemical assays and genetic studies; 2) characterize
the ZMYM3 functional complex(es) on post-replicative damaged chromatin; and 3) elucidate the mechanism of
how ZMYM3 regulates cell cycle-regulated DSB repair pathway choice and. We will focus on investigating
DYNLL1/LC8, a recently characterized DNA repair protein, and its physical, genetic and functional connections
with ZMYM3 in DSB repair regulation. Our long-term goal is to dissect the detail of how cells orchestrate DNA
repair via chromatin modifications. These studies are poised to provide critical insights into how H4K20me1 and
H4K20me2 dictate the choice between HR and NHEJ on post-replicative chromatin repair. It will also decipher
how ZMYM3 shapes the post-replicative chromatin epigenome and recruits DDR proteins at damaged chromatin.
Although inherited DDR defects predispose in cancer development, the vulnerability is therapeutically exploited
to preferentially kill tumor cells. Thus, DNA damaging agents are a major class of therapeutic agents that include
radiotherapy. Since chromatin directly regulates DNA repair proteins accrual at damaged chromatin, the
epigenome is an attractive target for drug discovery for cancer treatment. This work exploits a combination of
biochemical, genetic, epigenetics and cellular approaches to dissect the detailed mechanism of cell cycle-
regulated epigenome on genome integrity maintenance that can translate to potential biomarkers and drug
discovery for cancer treatment."
10792590,"Despite decades of research into the pathogenesis of amyloid disease, and improvements in patient
survival, most of these disorders remain invariably fatal due to significant cardiac and renal loads of organ-
compromising amyloid present at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, there is an urgent need for agents that
remove patient tissue amyloid, to complement current therapies designed to reduce the production of amyloid-
forming protein. Immunotherapy, using amyloid-binding antibodies or antibody fragments such as peptibodies
(peptide-fused antibody fragments), to recruit cells capable of clearing amyloid, is still the principle method of
choice for achieving amyloid clearance. However, translation of these reagents requires demonstration of
amyloid-binding in patients. This can be achieved by molecular imaging, thereby enhancing clinical trial design
and patient selection in the clinic.
 Our goal is to develop and characterize a novel pan-amyloid-binding human peptibody that is readily la-
beled of imaging and capable of clearing tissue amyloid. The agents we propose incorporate our amyloid-reac-
tive synthetic peptides, which we have already shown bind amyloid in patients in a Phase 1 imaging trial.
These will be fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc domain to generate a functional peptibodies, which can
engage macrophages through Fc-receptors and facilitate clearance of tissue amyloid. We have already devel-
oped and characterized a murine peptibody that exhibits excellent amyloid binding and stimulates macro-
phages in vitro. This proposal will assess the efficacy of various peptides in the context of humanized peptibod-
ies with the goal of identifying a lead candidate for clinical translation. The smaller size of peptibodies, relative
to antibodies may allow more efficient accumulation in tissue amyloid, notably in the heart and kidney, and the
choice of peptide will influence many biological factors that impact therapeutic efficacy.
 We have developed several quantitative assays to assess peptibody function using both synthetic amyloid-
like fibrils and patient-derived human amyloid extracts. A well-characterized murine model of systemic
amyloidosis will be used to evaluate the specific binding of radiolabeled peptibody with amyloid in vivo by
SPECT imaging, tissue biodistribution measurements, and microautoradiography. Optical imaging of dual
fluorophore-labeled human amyloid implanted in mice will be used to assess macrophage-mediated
phagocytosis and dissolution of amyloid in real time. Other assays including stability, structural
characterization, developability, and induction of phagocytosis are planned.
 Our long term goal is to generate an immunotherapeutic peptibody that can also serve as a companion
imaging agent to enhance the development program and serve as a patient-selection tool in the clinic. The
combination of identifying patients that would benefit from peptibody therapy, and an efficacious pan-amyloid
reactive reagent could result in significant clinical benefit for patients with these diseases."
10843042,"Project Summary/Abstract:
My laboratory research program in stochastic modeling and inference of evolutionary processes focuses on
developing efficient methods for inference of evolutionary parameters from molecular data, and statistical
tests for assessing evolutionary hypotheses. This proposal will focus on answering three fundamental
questions in the study of evolutionary processes: Are the observed patters of genetic diversity the result of
adaptive or non-adaptive evolution? What is the mode and strength of selection? How can we identify
genomic regions undergoing selection? Whether adaptation, demography or local patterns of mutations are
the sources of variation across populations, these forces influence the shape of the underlying genealogies
and phylogenetic networks. Hence, assessing differences among genealogies provide information about
differences in these forces, particularly among genealogies of different individuals, possibly living in
different environments and times. We propose to approach these questions by defining new coalescent
models of selection and exploiting a metric on the space of genealogies to define statistical tests. The
computational advantage and the ease of biological interpretation, together with the mathematical properties
of the proposed models and metric spaces, open the door to novel approaches for studying adaptation. Over
the next five years, the Palacios laboratory will combine tools from combinatorial optimization, Bayesian
inference, and coalescent theory to develop new coalescent models and tests applicable to studying the
evolution of pathogens and other organisms."
10757903,"Macrocyclic peptides (MCPs) can demonstrate antibody-like potency and specificity against ""undruggable""
targets such as protein-protein interactions. Some MPCs, especially ones found in nature, also have drug-like
cell permeability and even oral absorption, leading to the proposition that MCPs define a fertile ground for the
discovery of novel, cell permeable inhibitors against undruggable targets. My lab is among the leaders in the
worldwide effort to define the factors that govern passive membrane permeability in MCPs. In addition to
defining a set of rules for generating molecules in this space, we have shown that existing macrocyclic natural
products represent only a tiny fraction of potential permeable scaffolds in this size range (MW 700-1500). As
the basic science of membrane permeability in MCPs has continued to mature, new questions have arisen
which our lab is uniquely positioned to address: To what extent can side chains sequester polar backbone
atoms in the membrane, and, conversely, to what extent can polar side chain functionality be ""smuggled"" into
the membrane via interactions with backbone atoms? Are there scaffold geometries that enhance these
effects? What is the fundamental size limit to passive membrane permeability? To what extent can strongly
ionizable groups be incorporated into lipophilic MCPs without abrogating permeability? Can DNA-encoded
library technology be used to discover novel, membrane permeable scaffolds that greatly enhance the extent
to which we can evaluate this chemical space, especially in the higher MW range? Our program will capitalize
on recent developments in DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology to generate large (108 - 1012-member)
libraries that are diversified at both the side chain and backbone levels. We have shown that DNA-conjugated
MCPs can be separated chromatographically based on the permeability of the pendant macrocycle and
independent of the encoding DNA molecule, allowing us to use the power of split-pool synthesis and next-
generation sequencing to dramatically expand our ability to delineate the constraints on permeability among
highly diverse scaffolds well above 1000 MW. Finally, there have been few systematic studies on the impact of
scaffold geometry on efflux and hepatic metabolism, which, besides permeability, are important factors that
govern pharmacokinetic behavior. We will utilize our powerful split-pool synthesis and MSMS-analytical tool to
determine the effect of scaffold geometry on efflux and metabolism, which will further enhance our
understanding of this important chemical space. This MIRA proposal seeks to build on a vibrant and successful
research program to uncover the basic scientific principles governing drug-like properties in a chemical class
that continues to inspire medicinal chemists in their pursuit of ever more challenging targets."
10804623,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 1.1 million patients admitted annually to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for post-acute care after a
hospitalization have Alzheimer’s Disease or Related Dementias (ADRD), and their outcomes are poor and
variable. Given the high clinical complexity and care coordination needs of patients with ADRD, one potential
solution to improving the outcomes of patients with ADRD receiving SNF care is through physicians who
specialize in SNF-based care. “SNFists” (i.e., physicians for whom SNF patients comprise the majority of their
practice) are becoming increasingly common. Our prior work found a 37% increase in the prevalence of
SNFists from 2012 to 2015, with a high degree of variability across markets. In this study, we will examine
whether physicians specializing in SNF-based care improve functional outcomes and reduce potentially
avoidable healthcare utilization (such as hospital readmissions) of patients with ADRD receiving post-acute
care in SNFs. To accomplish these goals, we will expand an existing dataset of Medicare claims and SNF
clinical assessment data for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hospital to a
SNF from 2012 through 2019. Using this database, we will examine the trends in physician specialization in
SNF care in the context of market, facility, and physician characteristics. Next, we will measure the impact of
physician specialization in SNF care on the outcomes and healthcare utilization of patients with ADRD using
difference-in-differences cross-temporal matching. Lastly, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with key
SNF personnel (e.g., director of nursing, medical director) to quantitatively identify practice strategies and care
processes that differ between physicians in high- vs. low-performing SNFs based on the outcomes of patients
with ADRD. When complete, these studies will inform practice and policy to optimize (increase or reduce) post-
acute care patients’ access to physicians who specialize in SNF-based care. The findings will be used to
develop interventions to improve the value of SNF-based post-acute care for patients with ADRD."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a public health crisis in the United States. TBI is a very common injury
in young adults and causes long-term disabilities in cognition, learning and memory, emotional control, and
sensory and motor function. A severe TBI can lead to lifelong physical and psychological problems and
increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases. Severe TBI in young adults is a significant public
health problem and national burden because their lifelong disabilities, permanent productivity loss, and long-
term daily care dependence not only seriously affect the life of an individual and their family but also create a
heavy financial burden in the United States.
In the traditional view, TBI is an event that only needs acute management and a brief period of rehabilitation.
Today’s notion is that TBI is the onset of a chronic health condition that requires therapies for improving
recovery months and years after TBI. However, no such a treatment is available in the chronic phase. The
chronic phase exists in a long period from 3 or 6 months after TBI and throughout an individual’s life span. The
lack of treatment to improve severe TBI recovery in the chronic phase is a critical problem for the country.
Using a severe TBI model in young adult mice, we have demonstrated significant improvements in functional
recovery by a combination treatment of stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-
CSF) (SCF+G-CSF) in the chronic phase. However, it remains unclear how SCF+G-CSF treatment in the
chronic phase of severe TBI improves functional recovery. The objective of this application is to determine the
underlying mechanisms of the SCF+G-CSF-enhanced recovery in chronic TBI. Based on preliminary studies,
we hypothesize that SCF+G-CSF-improved severe TBI recovery in the chronic phase is mediated by the
enhancement of cerebral remyelination and neurostructural regeneration. Using the approaches of molecular
and cellular biology, pharmacology, Cre-LoxP technology, 2-photon live brain imaging and neurobehavioral
evaluation, this hypothesis will be tested through two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how SCF+G-CSF
treatment in the chronic phase of severe TBI enhances remyelination in cerebral white matter, and Aim 2 will
define how SCF+G-CSF treatment in the chronic phase of severe TBI enhances neural structure regeneration.
Searching for treatments to improve severe TBI recovery in the chronic phase is a highly-important-but-not-
investigated field and an urgent national demand to improve the health of young adults living with severe TBI. It
is expected that the accomplishment of the proposed mechanistic studies will significantly move the TBI
research field forward by identifying a unique pharmacological approach to repair a severe TBI-damaged brain
in the chronic phase."
10767860,"Medical and traumatic emergency conditions affecting the cardiac, respiratory, nervous, and hematologic systems collectively account for the overwhelming preponderance of death and disability affecting Americans. The ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic has brought into stark relief the importance of emergency care research to rapidly evaluate treatments, and the disproportionate burden that underserved populations suffer. It is imperative that new approaches for timely diagnosis and equitable treatment of these conditions be efficiently developed.  This renewal application is to continue and evolve the effective Southwest Strategies to Innovate EmeRgENcy Care Clinical Trials Network (SW SIREN) Hub and Spoke system to conduct high-quality, multi-site clinical trials to improve the outcomes for patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, and hematologic, and traumatic conditions. The SW SIREN consortium will leverage strong regionalized prehospital-medical center partnerships in major population centers in the Southwest (Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties in California, Denver, Colorado, and Clark County, Nevada), with a continued focus on recruitment of underrepresented populations. The Hub-and-Spoke consortium is comprised of the Award Hub, 5 Core Spoke Medical Centers, 83 Additional Spoke Hospitals, and 5 County EMS systems. Within the consortium are a total of 10 tertiary-quaternary academic centers able to participate in complex intervention trials and an extensive range of frontline hospitals able to participate in simple pragmatic trials. Building upon our success in training and mentorship of fellows and mid-career clinical trialists, we will utilize six Clinical and Translational Science Awards and seven universities to identify and elevate the next generation of SIREN clinical trialists. Twelve Advisory Panels with expertise in specific disease and research domains will facilitate trial implementation within the consortium and serve as a resource to the Hub leadership and to individual performance sites.  The four specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) perform high-quality pragmatic clinical trials in several different types of emergency disorders afflicting adults and children throughout the Southwest; 2) facilitate collaboration between emergency medicine physicians, disease specialists, and EMS systems throughout the Southwest in trial design and execution; 3) provide an educational environment that provides opportunities for designated SW SIREN junior faculty fellows to participate in clinical trial research under the supervision of experienced investigators and disseminates knowledge about emergency care to medical students, residents, fellows, and allied health professionals; and 4) ensure equitable participation of a substantial number of patients with emergency conditions in SIREN clinical trials, including women, children, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, and other traditionally underrepresented populations."

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) drive countless processes in biology. The ability to block these interactions
with high specificity is crucial for probing the basic science of these processes, as well as for developing imaging
agents or novel therapeutics. However, most traditional molecules for blocking protein-protein interactions—like
small molecules, peptides, or antibodies—rely on the precise targeting of the crucial interface or binding pocket,
which can be difficult for some targets. Furthermore, none of these approaches can be easily tuned to match the
valency or size of the target, and binding to patches on the protein not directly involved in PPIs can fail to block
activity. Here, we propose to develop a nanoscale synthetic antibody (“nano-synbody”) consisting of a tunable
DNA nanostructure bearing 2-3 peptide/protein ligands that can bind to distinct surfaces of a target protein and
block its association with its partner through the steric bulk of the DNA structure. The individual peptide/protein
binding agents will be derived from either known molecules, or found independently through methods like phage
display. Critically, our method merges computational simulation—and in silico “evolution”—of these hybrid
protein-DNA nano-synbodies, creating a library of structures and probing their association with the target. We
aim to create a feedback loop, whereby the computational simulations yield candidate nano-synbodies that can
be experimentally tested, further informing the next round of simulations. We will first apply this pipeline to a
homo-trimeric nano-synbody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer (Aim 1). This test bed will allow us to
optimize the process and find a high-affinity blocking structure. Then, we will apply our method to nano-synbodies
for blocking the assembly of fibrinogen into fibrin clots (Aim 2). The second Aim will involve phage display against
fibrin to find novel binding agents, and thereby convert them into high-affinity hetero-trivalent structures. In both
Aims, we will demonstrate the advantage of nano-structuring ligand presentation over simple oligomerization
with flexible linkers. Taken together, our work will generate a new computational-experimental paradigm for the
design of tunable, user-defined nanostructures that can present three or more peptides/proteins for binding to
any protein, and blocking its association with its target. Crucially, our approach does not require binding directly
to the interface, which should enable it to target a much larger range of proteins that may not be amenable to
traditional approaches, large protein complexes, or mutants/variants of the targets that might escape single
binding agents."

Biological oscillators are essential to a variety of cyclic processes in cells and development. These include cell
divisions, heartbeats, and somitogenesis. Impaired biological oscillators may cause diseases from insomnia to
cancer. It is thus crucial for an oscillator to develop the ability to maintain a stable function against the changes
in environmental conditions. The architecture of many oscillators is highly conserved among species, despite
that the actual molecules may vary from species to species. This highlights the important role of network topology
in the functions of biological oscillators. How the network structure is linked to the certain functions of biological
oscillators is still an open challenging question in systems and synthetic biology. The goal of this proposal is to
identify the fundamental principles underlying the robust functioning of clock networks. To achieve the goal, a
systematic computational approach will be applied to analyze all topological modifications that significantly
impact the robustness and tunability of clock networks. As a comparison to computational studies, this proposal
will experimentally investigate the possible mechanisms by which cell cycles retain robust oscillations. The
proposed experiments make use of a droplet-based microfluidic system, where cell-free extracts are
encapsulated in droplets to mimic single cells that undergo mitotic cycles. This artificial cell system will be
integrated with live embryo imaging and stochastic modeling, to track and analyze many single oscillators
simultaneously, and thereby quantify the robustness of the mitotic cycles to environmental changes and
molecular stochasticity. To study the role of network structure in the robustness of the clock, results from intact
oscillators will be compared with the ones whose sub-networks are compromised. The results from the mitotic
clock may apply to a broad set of other clocks that share similar topological cores. The results should also provide
valuable insights on how to design a robust synthetic clock."

Among aggressive lymphomas, the Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are among the
most highly proliferative, and have massive requirements for production of metabolic precursors.
Along these lines we recently identified NAD+ dependent lysine deacetylase SIRT3, as a master
regulator of mitochondrial stress metabolism, as a critical driver of DLBCL growth and
survival. We showed that SIRT3 loss of function in DLBCL cells kills lymphomas by disrupting
their ability to use glutamine and other amino acids in the TCA cycle, which triggers destructive
autophagy – both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we created the mitochondrial targeted SIRT3
selective small molecule YC8-02 that precisely mimics the effect of SIRT3 depletion and potently
killed DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo. These compounds yielded further enhanced killing effects
in combination with targeted therapies such as venetoclax as well with chemotherapy drugs
commonly used to treat DLBCLs. Finally, our mechanistic data point to pathways in cells that
could eventually lead to resistance to SIRT3 targeted therapy, as well as ways to prevent this
from happening so as to yield maximal therapeutic efficacy. An overarching challenge in
delivering precision medicine for DLBCL patients is their marked genetic heterogeneity and
extreme abundance of somatic mutations. There are currently no targeted agents with activity
and targets relevant to more than a small fraction of patients. However, we identified SIRT3
as a broadly relevant and critical non-oncogene addiction that is required by DLBCLs
independent of their genetic background. Through this proposal we provide the basis for i)
translating SIRT3 inhibitors to the clinic, ii) understanding and mitigating potential resistance
mechanisms, and iii) incorporating SIRT3 inhibitors into rationally designed anti-lymphoma
regimens with broad relevance for the subsets of patients who desperately need improved
therapies. Our proposal uses state of the art model systems physiologically relevant to these
complex tumors, and is poised to deliver highly impactful outcomes from the scientific and clinical
perspective."

 Children and adolescents (herein “youths”) treated in outpatient mental health care span a broad range
of problems and disorders, with substantial comorbidity, and their most pressing problems and treatment
needs may shift during treatment. These challenges may be addressed by treatment that is flexible and
transdiagnostic (i.e., applicable to multiple mental health problems and disorders). A recent transdiagnostic
treatment, FIRST, created in collaboration with community practitioners and intervention scientists, uses a
principle-based approach to support efficient learning and implementation by clinicians. FIRST is built upon five
empirically supported principles of change (e.g., calming, problem solving), each applicable to treatment of
depression, anxiety/OCD, trauma, and misconduct. Three open benchmarking trials of FIRST, using low-cost
clinician training and group consultation, have shown steep slopes of clinical improvement in youths treated in
outpatient clinics. The proposed randomized controlled effectiveness trial will provide a more definitive test of
FIRST, an initial investigation of a candidate mechanism of change, and tests of therapist characteristics that
may predict and moderate implementation of evidence-based practices.
 The sample will be ethnically and economically diverse youths, aged 8-15, from four community
clinics—two in greater Boston MA, two in greater Austin TX—all referred by their families and all showing
elevated depression, anxiety/OCD, post-traumatic stress, or conduct problems. Clinicians within each clinic will
be randomly assigned to learn and use FIRST or to employ Usual Care (UC), and youths will be randomized to
treatment by FIRST or UC clinicians. Clinical outcomes will include change on standardized measures of
mental health and on severity of the specific problems identified as most important by each youth and each
caregiver at baseline. Study measures will include a proposed mechanism—regulation of negative emotions—
thought to be responsive to treatment and responsible for changes in mental health. Analyses will assess
whether treatment with FIRST impacts regulation, and whether improved regulation accounts for outcomes of
FIRST treatment relative to UC. Finally, the study will investigate whether clinicians’ baseline knowledge of,
attitudes toward, and motivation to use evidence-based practices predicts or moderates their implementation of
such practices in psychotherapy. The study will thus provide the first randomized trial of this new practice-
adapted transdiagnostic treatment, plus an inquiry into the process through which it may work and therapist
factors that may strengthen or weaken implementation."
10767875,"Age-related cognitive decline (ARCD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and late-onset AD-related pathologies are linked
to changes in brain structure, cell populations, synapse densities and connections, inflammation, protein
aggregation and mitochondrial stress. However, we do not understand the complex causal networks and
mechanisms of ARCD and AD. In this neurogenetics imaging program we quantify the impact of human familial
AD (FAD) gene variants on brain structure and function using a highly diverse cohort of aging mouse hybrids
that combine human genes variants with the BXD family. In Aims 1 and 2 we generate high resolution whole
brain MRI DTI data and connectomes for each of 40 sex-matched sets of transgenic and aging control hybrids
at ~6 and ~14 months using state-of-the art analysis workflows. We generate matched behavioral data, as well
as light-sheet immunohistochemistry for entire brains taken from subsets of cases with the most outstanding
phenotypes—lines that are highly susceptible to cognitive loss and those that are most resilient. Light-sheet,
MRI-DTI and fMRI connectomes is merged with MI-DTI in Aim 3. All work exploits systems genetics and mapping
methods we have developed and embedded in the GeneNetwork web service. A crucial facet of Aim 3 is
integrating extensive behavioral data on age-related cognitive and other behavioral and CNS changes generated
from AD-BXD and many other models. This allows us to define loci, candidate genes, and mechanisms
modulating ARCD and AD, and to systematically test for associations with age, sex, and linked changes in
structure, connectivity, and cell types. Finally, we integrate omics data we have for BXD and other genomes
(e.g., hippocampal RNA-seq and proteomes) with comprehensive human AD GWAS, imaging, and omics data.
All results are shared openly using robust internet services—GeneWeaver, CIVM server, NIF, Mouse Phenome
Database, and the AMP-AD Knowledge Portal. Data and workflows will be FAIR-compliant. Key deliverables are
(1) far more quantitative, unbiased, global, and replicable data on genetic, molecular, cellular, and system-wide
processes linked to cognitive loss and AD. We also deliver causal molecular and mechanistic models of that
incorporate realistically high levels of genetic diversity—6 million DNA variants. This work empowers in-depth
unbiased analyses of age-related functional decline in ARCD and AD that translate to human populations.
Success will enable faster and more robust preclinical testing of interventions and drug treatments for ARCD
and AD."
10773039,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the greater than 350 Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID) in humans that have been identified to date,
the molecular basis of a significant number (~100) of PIDs have yet to be defined. Recently, 9 children (4 now
deceased) from 4 independent families were identified with severe PIDs that were linked to mutations in the
NCKAP1L gene encoding for Hematopoietic protein-1 (Hem-1), a conserved hematopoietic cell-specific
component the WAVE actin regulatory complex (WRC). Affected children presented with severe recurring
respiratory and skin infections, failed antibody responses to pneumococcal immunization (characteristic of B
cell immunodeficiency), dysregulated cytokine production, and autoimmunity. Although the cellular and
molecular functions of Hem-1 orthologues in flies and worms are relatively well characterized, there is a critical
knowledge gap regarding the cell specific functions of Hem-1 in the development and functions of primary
immune cells. Our longterm goal is to overcome this knowledge gap by dissecting the cell-specific roles of
Hem-1 in the development and functions of adaptive and innate immune cells. The objective of this proposal is
to disrupt Hem-1 expression in primary murine and human B lymphocytes in a B cell-specific manner to define
the roles of Hem-1 in B cell development, protective humoral immunity, and autoimmunity. Our Specific Aims
are to utilize inducible B cell specific gene targeting in mice, and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated Hem1 deletion in
“humanized mice”, to test our central hypotheses that B cell specific disruption in Hem1 results in: (1) impaired
B cell development in part due to reduced homing and retention of developing B cell progenitors in essential
lymphoid niches;(2) absent T cell independent antibody responses resulting in crippled protective immunity to
influenza A virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, important community acquired respiratory pathogens; and
(3) hyper-responsive B cell signaling and T-bet driven transcriptome, resulting in increased autoantibody
production. To demonstrate feasibility, we have generated innovative mouse models to emulate Hem1 PID
patients including mice with a non-coding point mutation in Hem1 (Hem1pt/pt), Hem1 null (Hem1-/-) mice,
Hem1floxed (Hem1fl/fl) mice, as well as Hem1 deficient ”humanized mice” which contain Hem1 deficient
primary human hematopoietic cells. Based on our preliminary results which strongly support our hypotheses,
we expect that the results of these studies will be highly significant and will have a high impact because they
will define for the first time, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how loss-of-function variants in
NCLAP1L disrupt B cell development, signaling, and protective antibody-mediated immunity resulting in PID
and autoimmunity. Because of extensive genetic heterogeneity of the 4 human PID families, limited number of
patients, and concurrent infections, the development of these innovative mouse model systems are critical for
dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how mutations in Hem-1 result in PID and autoimmunity,
and to provide much needed platforms to develop and test therapies to treat and cure Hem1 deficient children."
10767259,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
RNA-seq has become standard routine in many biological and biomedical experiments to study gene activities.
A very first step of RNA-seq analysis is usually to quantify the expression abundance of each transcript in the
reference transcriptome. However, studies have showed that current transcriptome is incomplete, which limits
the accuracy of expression quantification. As large-scale RNA-seq data are now available, an efficient and robust
way of constructing transcriptome is the assembly of the full-length expressed transcripts from a set of RNA-seq
samples, a computational problem known as meta-assembly. This proposal addresses this problem and aims to
develop efficient meta-assemblers for short-reads and long-reads RNA-seq data.
As previous studies, we have developed so far the most accurate single-sample assemblers Scallop (Nature
Biotechnology, 2017; for short-reads RNA-seq) and Scallop-LR (for long-reads RNA-seq). The core of Scallop
and Scallop-LR is the use of splice graph together with phasing paths, which encode reads spanning more than two
vertices, to represent reads alignment, and a novel algorithm that decomposes the splice graph while preserves
all phasing paths. This data structure and idea of “phase-preserving” provides algorithmic foundations for our
proposed meta-assembly algorithms.
The key of meta-assembly is to take advantage of shared and complementary information in the given samples.
We propose to combine multiple samples at the splice graph level. Specifically, for each gene locus, we construct
a single combined splice graph, through merging individual splice graphs and pooling their phasing paths. To
keep the information in individual splice graphs, their typologies will be encoded as additional phasing paths. The
entire data structure is therefore space-efficient and loss-free, and can be piped into following phasing-preserving
algorithms for decomposition. We will specialize our existing phasing-preserving algorithms to handle paired-end
phasing paths and long phasing paths. Eventually, statistical methods will be developed to infer the statistical
significance of each individual assembled transcript, and multiple hypothesis testing will be performed to control
overall falsely discovered transcripts. We also propose a new consensus-approach that learns a discriminator to
automatically select the optimal algorithm for different meta-assembly instances.
The outcomes of this project will be open-source, easy-to-use, reproducible and accurate meta-assemblers for
short-reads and long-reads RNA-seq data, respectively. These meta-assemblers will then enable more accurate
identification of novel isoforms and the annotation of gene structures. Combined with large-scale RNA-seq data,
data-driven transcriptomes can be constructed, benefiting downstream study such as RNA-seq quantification and
differential analysis."
10769751,"Summary
Chemotherapy is a mainstream treatment for most cancers, despite recent progress in the development of new
therapies for cancer. A well-documented long lasting toxicity of some chemotherapy agents is their capacity to
cause or intensify muscle wasting and fatigue in cancer patients, which are manifestations of cachexia. Cachexia
is a metabolic disorder contributing significantly to cancer-related morbidity and mortality due to systemic
wasting, as well as decreasing the efficacy while increasing the toxicity of chemotherapy. Consequently, patients
suffering from chemotherapy-related muscle wasting may experience difficulty adhering to or completing
treatment regimens and may require delays in treatment, dose limitation, or discontinuation of therapy. Further,
chemotherapy-related muscle wasting and fatigue can persist for months to years after the cessation of
chemotherapy. Thus, the interplay between chemotherapy and cachexia is a significant threat to cancer patient
survival and quality of life. However, the underlying mechanism of the detrimental effects of chemotherapy on
skeletal muscle is poorly understood, and there is no FDA-approved treatment for this chemotherapy toxicity.
The current proposal aims to address this clinical paradox by testing a novel hypothesis for the mechanism
through which fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, two widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, promote cancer’s
capacity to induce muscle wasting in tumor-bearing mice. Previously, supratherapeutic doses of 5-FU were
shown to promote muscle dysfunction directly in cancer-free animals by causing mitochondrial dysfunction and
oxidative stress but not activating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that mediates muscle protein loss. Given
that 5-FU is used in cancer patients, it is necessary to understand whether and how 5-FU promotes muscle
wasting at therapeutically relevant doses in cancer hosts. Similarly, cisplatin has been shown to cause muscle
dysfunction directly in cancer-free mice at a supratherapeutic dose, but whether and how it promotes muscle
wasting in cancer hosts are undefined. These knowledge gaps prevent clinical intervention of chemotherapy-
associated cachexia. Based on preliminary data, the current project is designed to test the hypothesis that 5-
FU and cisplatin cause or intensify muscle wasting in cancer hosts indirectly by stimulating the intrinsic capacity
of cancer cells to induce muscle protein degradation at therapeutic doses, and to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms of this action. Leveraging these findings, experimental therapies will be carried out by repurposing
existing pharmacological agents that inhibit 5-FU and cisplatin’s capacity to stimulate cancer-induced muscle
wasting. If successful, these drugs can be quickly tested in clinical settings for intervention of chemotherapy-
associated muscle wasting."

Abstract
The Research Center in Minority Institutions at Miami-Dade's Florida International University (FIU-RCMI) is
supported by the largest NIH Award in the history of FIU. Since 2017, the FIU-RCMI has been devoted to
developing and sustaining a national, clinical and behavioral research program addressing health inequities
and disparities primarily associated with HIV and substance use problems. We have provided extensive
research support and training for early-stage investigators (ESIs), partnered with underserved communities to
develop and conduct research, and capitalized on our community connections to develop supplementary large-
scale research combatting health disparities. FIU, our emerging preeminent research program in health
disparities, our ESIs, and our South Florida minority community partners all have benefitted from the NIMHD-
funded FIU-RCMI. We are enthusiastic about submitting this competitive renewal proposal for our Center,
which builds upon our earlier achievements, refines our approaches to ESI mentoring, community research
partnership, and faculty recruitment, and broadens our scope. Our scientific focus areas will include basic
biomedical research, behavioral research and population science, and clinical/health services research, with
one R01-equivalent project in each area. During the initial funding cycle of the FIU-RCMI, we concentrated on
behavioral and clinical research primarily regarding HIV and substance use problems. More recently, with
supplemental research funding, the hiring of new investigators, and the growth of our pilot studies and
community research enhancement programs, FIU-RCMI research concentrations have grown to include
behavioral, clinical, population, and basic biomedical research regarding Alzheimer's Disease, COVID-19, app-
based HIV prevention approaches, farmworker agrochemical exposure, and precision cancer therapeutics. Our
competitive renewal proposal reflects this growth. The FIU-RCMI is well positioned relative to FIU's priorities,
long-range goals and vision for health-related research. Moreover, FIU's Health Inequities and Disparities
Program, of which the FIU-RCMI is a major component, has been designated by FIU as an Emerging
Preeminent Program. Overarching goals of our proposed Center renewal include: 1. enhancing institutional
research capacity, 2. increasing investigator success in obtaining competitive extramural research support, 3.
fostering an environment conducive to career development for ESIs, 4. disseminating research generally and
specifically for advancing minority health, and 5. establishing sustainable relationships with community-based

 This proposal responds to PAR-22-039 and aims to develop focused ultrasound (FUS) as a next
generation high precision device-based pharmacological neuromodulation tool and evaluate its use in non-
human primates as a translational step to humans. Current device-based neuromodulation technologies rely
on interaction with cells’ endogenous sensitivities to different forms of energy. Although FUS alone overcomes
spatial and depth limitations of other non-invasive neuromodulation modalities, the diverse response of cells to
FUS presents a limitation and can make predictable neuromodulation difficult. We seek to move beyond the
paradigm of modulating via endogenous sensitivity by developing FUS in combination with phase shift
nanoemulsions (PSNEs)—200 nm liquid particles that can carry a drug payload and become microbubbles
when exposed to brief (<1 msec) FUS pulses above a threshold. By developing FUS combined with PSNEs,
we will be able to predictably modulate millimeter-scale regions throughout the brain by either locally
enhancing blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and injecting a drug or by releasing drugs from PSNEs
loaded with a drug. We propose a research plan that will move these technologies forward in the non-human
primate as an important translational step to humans. We first propose to develop an ultrasound transducer
that will decrease the focal spot size including receive elements that will allow us to map particle activation
through the skull. We will integrate the transducer into a FUS neuromodulation system built by our team under
the BRAIN Initiative and develop open-source software that will improve treatment planning for FUS
neuromodulation. We will apply this system to open the BBB in the sensorimotor region by activating PSNEs,
driving the resultant microbubble and injecting the inhibitory drug GABA, which does not cross the unopened
BBB in concentrations high enough to inhibit neurons. Because opening the BBB is not desirable in many
scenarios, we will also develop activatable drug-loaded PSNEs to locally deliver the anesthetic sodium
pentobarbital without opening the BBB. We will characterize the inhibitory effect of both neuromodulation
methods using BOLD fMRI and assess safety using neuroimaging and behavioral analysis. Our
multidisciplinary team has all expertise for MR-guided FUS with fMRI feedback and will collaborate with co-
investigator Dayton whose laboratory developed a condensation-based PSNE formulation that uses the same
excipients as commercially approved contrast agents. The acoustic technologies we propose to develop would
improve the spatial capabilities of FUS neuromodulation and explore two approaches for focal pharmacological
neuromodulation in the monkey including safety assessments that pave the way for translation."
11025587,"Project Summary
 This proposal responds to PAR-22-039 and aims to develop focused ultrasound (FUS) as a next
generation high precision device-based pharmacological neuromodulation tool and evaluate its use in non-
human primates as a translational step to humans. Current device-based neuromodulation technologies rely
on interaction with cells’ endogenous sensitivities to different forms of energy. Although FUS alone overcomes
spatial and depth limitations of other non-invasive neuromodulation modalities, the diverse response of cells to
FUS presents a limitation and can make predictable neuromodulation difficult. We seek to move beyond the
paradigm of modulating via endogenous sensitivity by developing FUS in combination with phase shift
nanoemulsions (PSNEs)—200 nm liquid particles that can carry a drug payload and become microbubbles
when exposed to brief (<1 msec) FUS pulses above a threshold. By developing FUS combined with PSNEs,
we will be able to predictably modulate millimeter-scale regions throughout the brain by either locally
enhancing blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and injecting a drug or by releasing drugs from PSNEs

10794310,"Despite advances in our understanding of the genetic origins of AML, treatment options have remained
essentially unchanged for 30 years, and clinical outcomes remain poor. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) represent
the population of blasts that are resistant to chemotherapy and re-initiate AML after therapy; thus, this subset of
blasts must be eradicated to cure disease. Unfortunately, therapies developed specifically to target LSCs have
yet to be validated in the clinic. We and others recently identified a novel AML antigen, CD97, that is expressed
in the vast majority of human AMLs. Our recently published studies have revealed several features of CD97 that
suggest that it may be an excellent therapeutic target in AML: 1) CD97 is one of the most commonly expressed
AML antigens; 2) CD97 regulates blast growth, survival, and differentiation; 3) CD97 regulates LSC function, as
demonstrated in serial transplantation experiments of primary AML; and, 4) CD97 is not required for HSC
function, suggesting low toxicity of CD97-targeting therapeutics. Highlighting its clinical importance, CD97 mRNA
expression is an independent predictor of disease-free and overall survival in AML.
 CD97 is an adhesion class G-protein coupled receptor (aGPCR) characterized by a long, extracellular ligand-
binding domain and a GPCR-Autoproteolysis-INducing (GAIN) domain that can induce signals that may or may
not require extracellular domain shedding. Isoforms of CD97 produced by alternative splicing differ in the
composition of the ligand-binding domain, but at present, it is unclear if the various CD97 isoforms mediate
unique or overlapping roles in AML. Our overall hypothesis is that the various CD97 isoforms play distinct roles
in leukemogenesis and LSC self-renewal by virtue of their unique ligand binding and/or signaling properties. Our
specific goals are to determine the role of CD97 isoforms in leukemic transformation and LSC function, to
identify the molecular and structural requirements for CD97 activity, and to utilize novel human synthetic
antibodies (sAbs) against CD97 with different epitope specificities to evaluate the function of CD97 as well as
test their anti-leukemic activity. We will determine the roles of the various structural subdomains of CD97 required
for LSC function utilizing our novel CD97 Abs, CD97 constructs expressing multiple naturally occurring and
engineered structural variants of CD97, and complementary in vitro and in vivo models of mouse and human
AML.
 Given our team's complementary expertise in LSC biology, antibody engineering, and aGPCR biology, we
are uniquely positioned to investigate the mechanisms of CD97 signaling and function in LSCs. Collectively,
these studies will dramatically increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate LSC self-
renewal and help expedite translation of CD97 antibody therapies to the clinic. Finally, these studies may have
broader consequences since CD97 plays disease-modifying roles in other human cancers."
10784713,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although West Africa is currently burdened with an unprecedented high levels of malaria, the research
capacity in Africa is too low to meet the malaria control and elimination goal. Furthermore, many new
techniques and tools developed in the developed countries have not been well utilized by Africa
scientists. For example, new tools in molecular population genetics, genomics and bioinformatics and
disease modeling have not been integrated into malaria research and control in Africa. Low research
capacity in West Africa is far more dire in comparison to other African regions. Therefore, there is an
immediate need to strengthen the research capacity in infectious diseases in West Africa. We propose
this Regional Centre for Vector Borne Diseases in West Africa (RCVBD) to enhance research capacity
in malaria epidemiology and medical entomology through training PhD students and junior faculty and
research scientists. The consortium partners are from three West African institutions (University of
Ghana, The Medical Research Council Unit Gambia, and Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la
Santé of Burkina Faso). Collaborators from three US institutions (University of California at Irvine,
University of New Mexico and the Northwestern University) will assist the training program. The overall
goal of this training program is to enhance research capacity in West Africa by training the next
generation of African scientists in the area of vector-borne disease research and control with a
special focus on malaria. The thematic areas of training include epidemiology, medical entomology
and application of new genetic, genomic and ecological research tools. We propose three tracks of
training. Track 1 will be long-term training of 8 PhD students in West Africa. Track 2 will provide short-
term research training to 15 junior university faculty and junior scientists from the Ministry of Health in
West Africa to foster specific skills required for malaria research and control. Track 3 will be training
workshops and short courses to disseminate techniques and knowledge to wide communities involved
in vector borne disease research and control in West Africa. This training program will focus on four
scientific areas in urgent need, including 1) new tools for malaria epidemiological and entomological
surveillance, 2) antimalarial drug resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs, 3) population genomics
of insecticide resistance, and 4) modeling malaria transmission dynamics and malaria intervention
strategies. This research training program will help advance the careers of West African scientists by
strengthening their academics and research productivity through vigorous mentorship and outstanding
publications, equipping them with new knowledge and skills, and enhancing their collaborative
opportunities with scientists within and out of Africa."

Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of death in patients with epilepsy. SUDEP
mechanisms are not understood, although there is evidence to implicate apnea, autonomic dysfunction, and
cardiac arrhythmias. Our work in mice led to the hypothesis that cardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanism
of SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. We demonstrated altered cardiac myocyte (CM) ionic
currents, calcium handling, and action potentials (APs), as well as cardiac arrhythmias in mouse models of
SCN1A-, SCN8A-, and SCN1B-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). We showed that
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CMs from Dravet syndrome (DS) patients have substrates for
arrhythmias. Importantly, no animal or iPSC model can completely replicate the human DS phenotype. Because
mouse and human cardiac APs are very different, we used human iPSC-CM models to investigate cell
autonomous effects of SCN1A haploinsufficiency. However, cells in 2-dimensional culture cannot replicate
complex cardiac tissues, cardiovascular changes, or cardiac innervation. Here, we will develop and validate a
large animal model in which the role of cardiac arrhythmias, in addition to seizures, in SUDEP can be
investigated. Rabbits closely replicate the human cardiac AP and provide a complete organism to translate to
the clinical setting. Our objective is to develop and validate a transgenic rabbit model of SCN1A-linked DS. We
generated a New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit Scn1a deletion model using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.
However, NZW Scn1a+/- rabbits showed neither seizures nor cardiac arrhythmia. We later found that F1: NZW x
Dutch Belted Scn1a+/- rabbits have seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, and premature death. These exciting results
suggest that we may have generated the first transgenic large animal model of a DEE, although this model must
now be rigorously validated. If validated, this work will be a significant advance over currently available DS
models. R61 Phase Specific Aims: 1. To characterize seizure onset, seizure types, seizure frequency and
duration, and determine the rate of SUDEP in DS rabbits. 2. To characterize arrhythmia types, frequency, and
duration, whether arrhythmias occur independently of seizures, and whether cardiac arrhythmia is associated
with SUDEP in DS rabbits. R33 Phase Specific Aim: To validate the model using the ASO drug STK-001 or the
drug combination stiripentol + clobazam to reduce seizures and SUDEP. Establishing a genetic rabbit model of
DS will better inform the translatability of neuro-cardiac mechanisms of SUDEP to human disease."

Preeclampsia (PEC) affects 1 in 20 pregnancies and is a leading cause of severe maternal morbidity and
mortality. Life-threatening neurological complications of PEC include intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral
edema, cerebral vasospasm, and ischemic stroke. Most maternal deaths due to PEC-associated
cerebrovascular complications occur postpartum. Despite this, clinical research has primarily focused on
antepartum blood pressure (BP) treatment, rather than postpartum. Current BP management guidelines for
postpartum patients recommend absolute thresholds for treatment, without accounting for factors such as
degree or rapidity of change from patients’ baseline BP. Clinicians urgently need better methods to 1) identify
individuals at risk for these devastating postpartum complications, and 2) guide BP management using
personalized, precise targets optimized for brain protection. Normal brain function requires constant cerebral
blood flow (CBF). Cerebral arterioles respond actively in response to fluctuations in BP, protecting the brain
from acute injury due to hypo- or hyper-perfusion, a phenomenon known as cerebral autoregulation. Changes
in cerebral autoregulation contribute to the pathophysiology of postpartum cerebrovascular complications. In
individuals with impaired autoregulation, targeting BP parameters to optimize cerebral perfusion could help
reduce the risk of ischemia, elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema and intracerebral hemorrhage.
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive bedside monitoring modality that measures brain tissue
oxygenation as a proxy for CBF. The use of NIRS-based autoregulation-guided BP targets improves clinical
outcomes in neurologically injured patients. We propose to apply this novel approach to the management of
postpartum PEC (within 6 weeks of delivery) in a single-center, Phase II clinical trial, PROMIS (PROtecting
Maternal brains from Injury and Stroke). We will use NIRS monitoring to calculate personalized limits of
cerebral autoregulation in 20 individuals with postpartum preeclampsia with severe features (Aim 1); and pilot
the use of autoregulation-guided BP goals for postpartum preeclampsia with severe features in an additional
20 individuals (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) standard guideline-based BP management for postpartum PEC
over 24 hours will result in ≥ 10% of time during which BP exceeds personalized upper or lower limits of
autoregulation; 2) more time with BP outside personalized limits of autoregulation will be associated with a)
increased neurological symptoms and b) objective evidence of cerebral hypo- or hyper-perfusion by NIRS; and
3) targeted BP management using autoregulation-guided goals will result in fewer neurological symptoms and
less time spent outside limits of autoregulation, compared with patients treated according to current guidelines.
This novel, high-risk, high-reward trial will be the first early phase interventional neuro-obstetric trial aimed at
preventing postpartum maternal death and disability due to neurological causes."

Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Despite encouraging progress in creating
new therapeutics, most lung cancer patients develop resistance and succumb to metastatic disease. The
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is frequently mutated in lung
cancer (10-50%). Several EGFR inhibitors have been developed to mitigate the transformative effects of mutant
EGFR. For example, gefitinib and osimertinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used for treating EGFR-
mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, despite the initial responsiveness of patients to
these drugs, a rapidly acquired resistance occurs mainly because of new genetic alterations, including
amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET).
Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing represents 90% of all the RNA editing events in the cell and regulates
mRNA sequence, function, degradation, and structure. RNA editing has been observed in both coding and non-
coding genes, including miRs. Furthermore, coding RNA editing dysregulation has been recently associated with
cancerous phenotype and drug resistance, including against TKIs.
Recent high throughput interrogation of the human genome has allowed for the identification of miR editing
deregulation in cancer. However, the biological impact of edited non-coding RNAs (i.e., miRs) in lung cancer
progression and drug resistance remains largely unknown.
We preliminarily identified a reduction of A-to-I editing in position 5 of miR-411-5p in the tissues of lung cancer
patients. We determined that ed.miR-411-5p negatively affects the ERK1/2 pathway, directly targets MET, and
alters TKI drug resistance in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, it is reported that MET transcriptionally regulates
the expression of miR-222. We have also found that the miR-222 targets ADAR2, a member of the ADAR
proteins family, responsible for pre-mRNA and non-coding RNA A-to-I editing. ADAR2 also induces A-to-I editing
in miRs, including miR-411-5p. We found that ADAR2 is downregulated in lung cancer tissues and TKI resistant
tissue and cell lines and anticorrelates with miR-222 expression.
We hypothesize that miR editing dysregulation contributes to the pathobiology of lung cancer. Therefore, we aim
to globally evaluate the impact that ed.miR-411-5p has on NSCLC progression and TKI resistance. Then, we
also intend to investigate by RNA seq. if the ed.miR-411-5p induces ADAR2 expression and activity through
MET, ERK1/2, and miR-222 signaling repression with the scope of uncovering new post-transcriptional
mechanisms that regulate lung cancer progression and drug resistance."
10799678,"Cancers that depend on the spatial location of the disease affect all ethnicities and age groups,
accounting for significant mortality and therapy-related side effects. In one instance, over 50,000
new cases of head and neck squamous carcinomas are diagnosed each year in the United
States, leading to large, rich repositories of patient data. For each of these cases, oncologists
need to anticipate survival, oncologic, and toxicity outcomes associated with treatment
strategies in order to select a treatment which balances efficacy and toxicity. However, despite
the wealth of data available, in the clinic decision support for cancer treatment is rudimentary
and incorporates only a handful of patient characteristics, largely due to a lack of computational
methodology and tools.
We propose to construct a novel statistical and computational methodology for longitudinal and
personalized treatment decisions over time, with specific application to head and neck cancer
therapy planning. Simultaneous incorporation of complex factors---such as radiation dose
location with respect to radiosensitive organs or patient reported side effects affecting quality of
life---into treatment decisions over the course of cancer therapy requires the development of
novel methodology. This methodology is revolutionary in that it is the first in the field to include
both imaging and nonimaging data, while taking into account large-scale biological and clinical
correlates. The approach is innovative through its leverage of big data repositories and through
its unique blend of computational modeling principles from bioengineering and computer
science. These methods allow us to incorporate diverse data types and model competing
outcomes.
From a clinical perspective, this integrative approach is novel in the field of cancer therapy. The
resulting clinical decision support methodology will mark a significant advance in biomedical
computing because it will be able to identify, for the first time, actionable timepoints for therapy
and toxicity modification, based on a patient’s characteristics and quality of life indicators. The
empirically-derived treatment decision support methodology developed in this project has the
potential to directly improve the standard of care and the quality of life of surviving patients with
a grave, often fatal and debilitating illness."
10794986,"SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a universally fatal brain tumor. Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), such as anti-
programmed cell death-1 protein (aPD1), alone or in combination with bevacizumab - an anti-vascular endothelial
growth factor antibody (aVEGF), failed to improve survival in phase III clinical trials in GBM. This failure is, in
part, due to the formidable barriers that the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) creates. First, GBM tumor cells
are highly proliferative and invasive with low neoantigen load, and thus, can easily evade immune surveillance.
Second, GBM vessels are abnormal, and thus, they create a leaky, hypoxic and edematous TME and limit the
delivery of drugs and the access of antitumor immune cells such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) into the tumor
resulting in a cold CTL-excluded TME. Moreover, limited number of CTLs that accrue within GBM TME are
dysfunctional. In contrast, pro-tumor immune cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and “M2-like” macrophages
preferentially accumulate in GBM. Unlike CTLs, Tregs and “M2-like” macrophages do not require intact vessels
for trafficking to the tumor and thrive and proliferate in the GBM TME. Third, our pilot studies indicate that aPD1
aggravates vascular abnormalities and inflammatory responses in GBM, causing toxicities. Collectively, these
features give rise to a strongly immunosuppressive TME in GBM that resists both the standard of care (SoC) and
immunotherapy. Our preclinical and clinical studies and those of others indicate that angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) can
shorten the duration of aVEGF-induced vascular normalization. Thus, we hypothesize that normalizing tumor
vasculature by co-targeting angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and aVEGF (abbreviated as aA2V) can both overcome
resistance to aPD1 and reduce toxicities in patients with GBM. We will test if aA2V+aPD1 can durably
normalize tumor vessels and improve their function. At cellular level, we will test if aA2V+aPD1 can repair the
dysfunctional endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules, which are required for CTL cell trafficking, convert
them to non-canonical antigen presenting cells to present tumor antigens to CTLs, and collectively result in
improved CTL infiltration and function (Aim 1). We will further determine the involvement of antibody-
dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) in aPD1-induced adverse events and their alleviation by aA2V (Aim 2).
Finally, we will use our newly developed surgical model that faithfully recapitulates GBM therapy in mice
including SoC (surgery and chemo radiation) to test whether combining SoC with aA2V+aPD1 can promote
durable responses (longer survival and memory responses) (Aim 3). Our findings will provide unprecedented
insights into the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in GBM, establish a novel strategy to overcome this
resistance while abrogating putative adverse effects, and directly inform the design of clinical trials of GBM
patients with combination aA2V+aPD1 therapy and SoC."
10820547,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Metabolic Tissue Function Core
 The purpose of the Metabolic Tissue Function Core is to improve the efficiency of diabetes-related
research through provision of expertise, equipment, and services that optimize the investigational capacity of
Washington University Diabetes Research Center (DRC) members. The Core facilitates acquisition of high
quality rodent and human islets and assists investigators in developing induced pluripotent stem cells.
In addition, the Core provides services for the functional analyses of islets and other metabolic tissues
relevant to the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. These functional studies include hormone
secretion assays, assessment of -cell mass, quantification of metabolism, and characterization of other
variables critical to the pathogenesis of diabetes. The Core provided services to 34 different DRC member
laboratories during the past funding period, including 6 P&F recipients, and these services supported the
publication of 51 papers. The Metabolic Tissue Function Core, through its unique expertise, state-of-the-art
equipment, and services, thus has considerable potential to contribute to the development of new therapies
likely to improve the health of Americans with diabetes, prediabetes, related endocrine and metabolic
diseases, and their devastating complications."
10820552,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Mass Spectrometry Core (formerly Metabolomics Core)
 Diabetes and its related endocrine and metabolic disorders are characterized by disruption of
homeostasis. Aberrant signaling cascades involving protein post translational modifications such as
phosphorylation, accumulation of potentially toxic lipid species, and altered flux of intracellular metabolites are
among the abnormalities that constitute the diabetic milieu. The DRC Mass Spectrometry Core, an expanded
version of the former Metabolomics Core, provides rigorous mass spectrometry-based proteomics and
metabolomics analyses to DRC investigators that include quantification, structural characterization, and
functional characterization of diabetes-related biomolecules. The Core increases efficiency and cost
effectiveness by providing centralized, standardized mass spectrometry analyses to study molecular
mechanisms of the pathogenesis of diabetes, its risk factors, and its complications. A major goal of the
core is to promote use of mass spectrometry (MS) methods in diabetes research through training,
collaboration, development, service, and dissemination. Specific objectives of the Core are: 1) to provide and
maintain functional MS systems for diabetes-related studies; 2) to consult with DRC investigators regarding
how MS can advance their research programs; 3) to perform service-related MS analyses for diabetes
investigators, such as quantifying target analytes, obtaining spectra for structural identification, and assisting
with mass spectra interpretation; 4) to develop new MS methods; and 5) to provide training to students and
fellows in principles and use of MS systems. During this past funding period, this Core, operating as the
Metabolomics Core, provided services to 34 different DRC member laboratories, including 3 P&F recipients,
and the >11,000 hours of Core service supported the publication of 90 papers. Through a substantial
institutional investment, the capabilities of this Core have increased prompting a name change to DRC Mass
Spectrometry Core. The services offered by the Mass Spectrometry Core reflect the evolving bioanalytical
needs of DRC investigators, including 1) quantitative study of protein expression, including targeted assays
from clinical samples; 2) quantitative assessment of protein-protein interactions; 3) characterization of post
translational modifications; 4) elucidation of the biological functions of proteins or protein groups; 5) targeted
metabolomic services; 6) broad surveys of multiple metabolic pathways and quantification of pathway
metabolites via untargeted metabolomics; and 7) high-throughput, quality-controlled measurements of analytes
in large sample sets from clinical studies. The Mass Spectrometry Core thus leverages substantial institutional
investments in instrumentation and analytical expertise to promote new discoveries and scientific progress in
diabetes research at the Washington University DRC."
10820558,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Translational Diagnostics Core
 The long-term goal of the Washington University Diabetes Research Center (DRC) Translational
Diagnostics Core is to improve human health by supporting clinical laboratory testing services for
research in diabetes mellitus and related metabolic disorders. Over 50 analytes are routinely available as
part of the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment (CLIA) test menu. Several other analytes are
available on multiple testing platforms for research use. Most quantitation is performed on serum or plasma
samples from human studies. Some analyses are performed on samples from animal models. During this past
funding period, the Core provided services to 46 different DRC member laboratories (including 9 P&F
recipients), and 16 external academic users, and these services supported the publication of 100 papers. More
than 137,000 test results were provided, including >37,000 human insulin values, >33,000 human C-peptide
values, and >3,000 mouse insulin values. The Core seeks to provide expert consultation to investigators so
that the most appropriate tests can be chosen while taking cost, sample volume, and number of samples into
consideration. In addition to quantification of classic metabolic analytes relevant to diabetes, such as insulin
and glucagon, the Core has added glycated albumin, which promises to be a useful marker of intermediate
term glucose control, and will add type 1 diabetes autoantibodies during the next funding cycle. The Core also
offers assays for diabetes and metabolism relevant molecules, such as adiponectin, leptin, IL-6 and TNF. For
analytes not offered in-house, the Core maintains contracts with outside laboratories, so that these analyses
can be performed at substantially lower cost to DRC members. Development of new research tests on
specialized equipment is another important activity of the Translational Diagnostics Core, which makes the
latest advances in diabetes and metabolism research available to DRC members. A newly acquired single
molecule counting instrument will allow better accuracy for low-abundant signaling molecules with a wider
dynamic range than with traditional methods. The Translational Diagnostics Core provides efficient, high
quality diagnostic services promoting the translation of basic scientific discoveries for the prevention, treatment
and cure of diabetes and its complications."
10781890,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this K01 award is to provide Dr. Joshua Wallach, an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at
the Yale School of Public Health, with the protected time necessary to become an independent expert in
synthesizing, evaluating, and establishing the best evidence to inform clinical practice in the field of alcohol use
disorder (AUD). Although AUD is a common and morbid disease, for which medication treatment is available,
uncertainties about whether and for whom treatments work may be causing AUD medication underutilization.
To advance the evidence base to support AUD medication treatment, research is needed to identify patient
subgroups that are most likely to benefit from each medication used to treat AUD. However, traditional
subgroup analyses often consider only one patient characteristic at a time and are conducted in small clinical
trials with strict exclusion criteria, short durations, and outcomes that may not reflect how patients feel or
function. This proposed K01 will address these limitations by conducting subgroup analyses using multiple
data sources, outcomes, and analytical techniques. In Aim 1, Dr. Wallach will identify and assess the validity of
already published subgroup analyses to establish promising patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit
from each medication used to treat AUD. In Aim 2, existing data from the largest AUD trial in the US (the
COMBINE study) will be used to (a) corroborate promising patient subgroup differences identified in Aim 1 and
(b) explore new differences between patient subgroups, using multiple methods (i.e. traditional and statistical
learning, which can consider multiple characteristics) and outcome measures (abstinence, heavy drinking, and
2-shift reduction in World Health Organization drinking levels). In Aim 3, claims data from OptumLabs, a
database of over 150 million privately insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees, will be used to determine
whether the same, similar, or new differences between patient subgroups are observed in real-world settings
when hospital and ambulatory care outcomes are considered. These aims will clarify uncertainties among
patients and clinicians regarding the adoption of AUD medications, which can decrease the public health
burden associated with AUD. To support these aims, Dr. Wallach’s career development plan will include
training in: (1) AUD medications and addiction medicine, (2) novel statistical learning techniques that can be
used to inform individualized clinical decision making, and (3) pharmacoepidemiology and observational
research methods for real-world medical product evaluation. The candidate has identified an interdisciplinary
team of mentors and advisors, including co-primary mentors Dr. Joseph Ross, a health services researcher
and administrative data expert, and Dr. Stephanie O’Malley, an AUD treatment and addiction medicine expert.
The Yale Schools of Public Health and Medicine provide the ideal environment for career development. This
K01 will prepare Dr. Wallach for an R01 submission, and will facilitate his long-term goal of developing an
innovative research program combining meta-research and real-world evaluation to improve AUD clinical care."
10773008,"PROJECT 3 – REGULATORY RNAS AS CANCER DRIVERS AND DEPENDENCIES
PROJECT SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a large and relatively understudied class of RNA molecules that
have great potential to provide novel opportunities to influence gene regulation and cancer biology. The long-
term goal of Project 3 is to identify lncRNAs that are over-expressed in basal-like triple negative breast cancer
(B/TNBC) and basal-like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (B/PDAC), define their roles in the disease, and
develop approaches to manipulate their expression in vivo to impact cancer progression and metastasis.
MALAT1 lncRNA has been shown to be upregulated in over 20 different cancer types and high expression of
MALAT1 has been shown to be associated with the propensity to metastasize, poor patient outcome, and drug
resistance. In Aim 1, a series of studies are proposed to determine the role of human MALAT1 lncRNA, taking
advantage of a recently established innovative patient-derived breast tumor organoid BioBank containing
organoids from various tumor sub-types as well as normal breast organoids. RNA antisense purification of
MALAT1 followed by mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) will be carried out to identify common and tumor-specific
MALAT1-associated proteins with a specific focus on proteins involved in transcription and/or pre-mRNA splicing.
To probe the role of MALAT1 in cancer progression, ASO-mediated knockdown (KD) will be carried out to assess
alterations in gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing, as well as impact on tumor growth and metastasis in
patient-derived organoid xenograft (PDO-X) models +/- standard-of-care drugs. In Aims 2 and 3, a series of
studies are proposed to determine the function of several recently identified lncRNAs that are significantly
upregulated in both B/TNBC and B/PDAC. Cellular fractionation and a CRISPR screen will identify those
lncRNAs that are chromatin-associated and essential. Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) coupled
to deep sequencing and RAP-MS will be used to identify genes that these lncRNAs regulate, and critical
protein interactors. Candidate lncRNA function in proliferation, migration, invasion will be assessed upon ASO
KD and over-expression studies. The impact of lncRNA loss on gene expression, pre-mRNA splicing, and
chromatin structure, as well as therapy response, will be evaluated. PDO-X models will be used to study tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo and to assess the impact of lncRNA KD on tumor progression. These studies will
define the functions of several newly identified chromatin-associated lncRNAs that are over-expressed in both
B/TNBC and B/PDAC, and determine their role(s) in gene expression as well as their potential as therapeutic
targets. Together, the proposed studies in this Project will address the function of a set of nucleic acid therapeutic
targets and nucleic acid antisense-based therapies to impact cancer progression and metastasis."

10880315,"ABSTRACT
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder affecting over 1 billion people worldwide.
Undiagnosed and untreated OSA is also associated with a substantial economic burden, accounting for an
estimated annual cost of $149.6 billion. Given the significant disease burden and economic costs associated
with undiagnosed and untreated OSA, a robust clinical research framework is needed to address the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of OSA. The P4 Medicine approach to Obstructive Sleep Apnea that drives this overall
Program Project aims to conduct scientific studies that predict who will develop the disorder, prevent OSA and
its adverse consequences, and personalize diagnoses, therapies, and clinical care. In order to study OSA
through the Project in this Program, diverse and complex data from a variety of data sources, including the
electronic health record (EHR), daily continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) usage and adherence
information, genetics, and molecular biomarkers must be studied. To effectively answer the scientific questions
posed by each Project, we have constructed a Data Integration Core (Core C) to collect, integrate, and analyze
information derived from these varied data sources. Our team will be led by Director Dr. John Holmes, an
established medical informatician and epidemiologist with over 35 years of experience in database design and
implementation, development of information systems for clinical research, and analytic collaborations with
biostatisticians and clinical researchers. Core C will be co-led by co-Directors Dr. Danielle Mowery, a clinical
informatician with expertise in data science, machine learning, and clinical research informatics, and Dr. Diego
Mazzotti, a sleep medicine researcher with specific training in biomedical informatics. The Core C leadership
and support staff bring decades of experience in clinical research, sleep medicine, data science, informatics,
digital health, genome science, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Collectively, Core C will provide data collection
and management resources, as well as development and incorporation of cutting-edge approaches to data
integration and analysis to support all Projects. We will also implement strategies related to all stages of clinical
research data management, including clinical database mining, integration of heterogeneous data sources, and
data representation according to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles, making all
tools and approaches open-source and available to the biomedical research community at large."
10799596,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - CORE C: Single-Cell Analysis Core
HR arises from cell-to-cell variation of genotypic and metabolic processes. The goal of the Single-Cell Analysis
Core (Core C) is to provide experimentally-validated and yet difficult-to-perform single-cell-level analyses to
evaluate the mechanisms and dynamics of HR. Core C will support the single-cell-level studies proposed in all
three Projects by providing a centralized platform for culturing bacterial cells under well-controlled antibiotic
environments, measuring relevant processes at single-cell resolution, and performing image analysis as well as
necessary statistical analysis. Specifically, Core C will i) provide microfluidic continuous culture platform, ii)
quantify the copy number variation of resistance genes, and iii) determine metabolic activities of single cells in
heteroresistant populations. Core C activities will be conducted by Dr. Minsu Kim's laboratory in the Department
of Physics at Emory University, which has extensive expertise in single-cell-level imaging and analysis of gene
expression, metabolism, and physiology in bacteria. Dr. Kim was one of the first scientists to apply a single-cell
approach to antibiotic research and is considered a leading expert in this area. Dr. Kim and his team will work
with the PI of individual projects collaboratively to ensure they can successfully complete their projects in a timely
manner."
10792947,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in childhood has an aggressive etiology, with substantial short- and long-term
health complications and medical costs. There is an urgent need to: 1) identify children and adolescents at
highest risk; 2) identify modifiable contributing factors; 3) understand the underlying pathophysiology; and, 4)
determine how these factors vary across sex and race/ethnicity. A comprehensive and holistic understanding of
these issues is required to develop models that can identify individual factors and susceptible time windows for
T2D conversion and requires a nationwide effort and multidisciplinary consortium. We propose to serve as 1 of
the 15 Clinical Centers operating within the proposed NIDDK consortium that will recruit and track a national
cohort of children (estimate = 3,750) representing the diversity of the pediatric population at risk for T2D. Our
multidisciplinary team has extensive expertise in longitudinal studies of obesity and diabetes in children, including
an NIDDK-funded 15-year longitudinal study (R01 DK 59211; PI: Goran) that followed a cohort of 300 Latino
children at risk for T2D, resulting in almost 100 publications. From this and other prior studies, we have identified
the need for a larger and more diverse cohort, incorporation of environmental exposures, and inclusion of
comprehensive nutritional, metabolic, and social determinants. At our site, we will recruit 250 participants
with obesity and family history of T2D with bi-annual assessments. We will work with stakeholders and other
consortium sites to optimize recruitment and retention. We propose three complementary approaches to assess
the metabolic basis of T2D: insulin secretion, clearance, and β-cell function from an oral glucose tolerance test
with frequent sampling; hemoglobin A1c, and percent time in range from continuous glucose monitoring. We will
monitor metabolic and environmental factors by measuring: 1) total body fat, visceral and subcutaneous
abdominal adipose tissue, and liver and pancreatic fat by DEXA and MRI; 2) biochemical markers (free fatty
acids, sex steroids, lipids, inflammatory profiles, incretins, and liver enzymes); 3) lifestyle (diet, sleep, and
physical activity); 4) exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and air pollution; 5) social determinants of
health. In addition, we propose collection of biological samples (eg DNA, stool, saliva) to create a biobank for
future investigation. We will work with the consortium to develop a unified protocol and harmonized outcome
measures. We hypothesize: 1) Children who develop T2D will have a greater pubertal decline in β-cell function,
and decreased glucose time-in-range, which will be associated with greater increase in overall adiposity and
liver fat, compared to children who do not develop T2D, and that these relationships will differ across sex and
ethnicity; and, 2) High dietary sugar, limited access to healthy foods, and higher exposure to perfluoroalkyl
substances and/or air pollutants will also be associated with risk of T2D. Through harnessing the power of this
consortium, we also propose development of a structured risk score analysis to characterize different endotypes,
exposures and risk factors that predict progression to T2D during pubertal development."
10765735,"Abstract: Sedentary behavior is becoming increasingly prevalent with the expansion of a ‘work from home’
culture, most recently driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. We now spend more time sitting than in all other
activities combined. This increased chair dependency, including a reduction in occupational energy expenditure
over the past 5 decades, has contributed to the epidemic of chronic disease, including metabolic syndrome,
cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies, including a large meta-analysis
of 18 studies totaling 794,577 subjects, concluded that sedentary behavior mediates T2DM. The CDC predicts
that if current trends continue, as many as 1 in 3 U.S. adults could have diabetes by 2050. At present, 9% and
34% of U.S. adults have T2DM and prediabetes, respectively. Although we excluded diabetics in our pilot study,
11 of the 15 overweight or obese subjects were found to have some insulin resistance by HOMA-IR at baseline
(BMI positively correlates with the incidence of T2DM). In our pilot study of 15 subjects with sedentary office
jobs, 6 months of sit-stand desk use resulted in a 23% improvement in insulin resistance, most substantial in
those who decreased daily sitting by over 90 minutes/day. Additional improvements in vascular endothelial
function and triglyceride levels were seen without any change in exercise activity, step counts, or body weight.
These findings not only corroborate epidemiologic findings on this topic but suggest causality and warrant a
randomized control trial. This strategy of replacing sitting desks with a sit-stand desk has significant potential to
reduce cardiometabolic risk in the 70% of adults categorized as overweight or obese, the majority of whom have
insulin resistance. This intervention could have substantially strong impact, amplified by the COVID-19
pandemic, given nearly 80% of U.S. jobs are sedentary. We hypothesize that adult subjects at-risk for
diabetes will improve insulin sensitivity, metabolic and vascular (endothelial) health with a sit-stand desk
intervention at work (whether in the office or at home), in the context of a randomized, controlled trial.
We will randomize 198 sedentary office workers with a BMI≥25 at risk for T2DM in a 1:1:1 ratio of three groups:
(a) sit-stand desk intervention targeting 2 hours standing per day; (b) sit-stand desk intervention targeting 3 hours
standing per day; or (c) control arm over 6 months. Objective quantification of sitting and standing times will be
performed with sophisticated activity monitors and smartphone activity logs. We will ascertain if the sit-stand
desk improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic health and whether there is a dose-dependent relationship with
changes in sedentary time (Aim 1). We will determine if the intervention improves vascular endothelial function
locally (superficial femoral artery FMD) and/or systemically (assessing brachial artery FMD resilience) (Aim 2).
Sub-aims will assess changes in circulating triglycerides and free fatty acid levels and correlate with changes in
endothelial function. Affirmative findings would move the field forward by demonstrating that a readily adoptable
workplace intervention focused only on reducing sitting time alone, reduces cardiometabolic risk."
10830280,"Project Summary/Abstract
We propose studies to evaluate the direct impact of preimplantation embryo manipulation on the metabolism of
embryos and tissues. Because embryo manipulation is routinely used in the context of Assisted Reproductive
Technologies (ART) to treat patients with infertility, these goals have wide clinical implications. In fact, more
than 8 million children have been conceived by the technologies and more than 2.5 million in vitro fertilization
(IVF) cycles occur every year. Hence, there is great need to know if preimplantation embryo manipulation
induces subtle, but possibly long-lasting effects on the health of ART offspring.
The focus of this application is at the core of the PI’s expertise, as he has devoted most of his career to
understanding how ex-vivo embryo manipulation is associated with changes in the embryo (altered gene
expression, development, mitochondria function) and long-term maladaptive changes in the offspring (defects
in placentation, altered postnatal growth and ultimately altered glucose homeostasis).
While these results are important, multiple key questions remain unanswered. In particular, the molecular
mechanisms responsible to alter growth and metabolism in adults are unknown. For example, it is unclear if
metabolism is altered in embryos generated in vitro and if these metabolic alterations are maintained in adults
and responsible to cause abnormal glucose handling in adults generated by IVF. Importantly, the President's
Council on Bioethics and Congress urged the NICHD to determine whether these adverse outcomes are
specifically related to ART procedures.
Exciting novel preliminary data suggest that alteration of glycolysis and lactate metabolism are present in
embryos and possibly in adult generated by IVF. Based on preliminary data, objectives of this application are
to: 1) understand if alteration of glycolytic pathways exist in embryo who have undergone different degrees of
manipulation; discover the mechanisms leading to 2) metabolic alterations and 3) if specific epigenetic
changes exist; finally, 4) study if these alterations are maintained in adult mice conceived by IVF. Our central
hypothesis is that the ex vivo embryonic environment, deviating profoundly from the in vivo conditions (different
oxygen concentrations, altered energetic sources) cause increase in reactive oxygen species. Reparative
mechanisms will induce metabolic alterations and epigenetic changes. These molecular alterations will be
maintained in adult offspring resulting in altered glucose and lactate metabolism. Regarding expected
outcomes, we will: 1) determine what culture conditions produce greater or smaller change in glycolysis in
embryos, 2) discover the pathways responsible for these changes, 3) describe the specific epigenetic changes
induced by these alterations and finally 4) discover what metabolic pathways are altered in IVF offspring.
These datasets are expected to have an important impact because of the translational value to the fields of
developmental reprogramming, diabetes, obesity and for patients affected with infertility."
10806241,"The breakthroughs in diagnosis of rare diseases made possible by genome sequencing (GS) are some
of the most exciting in medicine today. Rare diseases affect nearly 30 million individuals in the United States,
and two-thirds of those affected are children. Studies suggest that GS (including exome and whole genome
sequencing) may be able to provide a diagnosis to up to 50 percent of patients previously undiagnosed after
extensive clinical and genetic testing. However, the downstream benefits and costs of these tests for patients,
families, and the healthcare system remain poorly defined and methodologically challenging to assess. In
response to these challenges, leaders in health economics and policy have called for the development of new,
interdisciplinary methods for defining and measuring the value of GS. In order to ensure these methods are not
only accurate, but also ethical, it is critical to bring to the surface a consideration of the values and preferences
of various stakeholders (i.e., patients, families, clinicians, payers) involved in the use of GS for diagnosis of
rare diseases, and whose values are served by different methodological approaches to defining and measuring
the value of GS.
 The goal of the proposed research is to examine both how we can, and how we should, define and
measure the value of GS for pediatric patients with rare diseases. This proposal has three specific aims. Aim
1: to identify the range of potential downstream impacts of GS for pediatric patients undergoing GS for
diagnosis of rare diseases and their families, using in-depth ethnographic methods to capture perspectives of
diverse stakeholders. Aim Two: To build on Aim 1 to develop a framework mapping the range of costs and
benefits of GS as they relate to a) diverse stakeholder perspectives on the value of GS for diagnosis of rare
diseases; and b) relevant domains of health-related quality of life (HRQL) for pediatric patients with rare
diseases. Aim Three: To build on Aim 2 to develop a preference-based measure for assessing the impact of
GS on HRQL specifically for pediatric patients with rare genetic diseases for use in future economic
evaluations of GS. If successful, the proposed research will provide essential and timely data to guide policy
recommendations for effective, ethical, and equitable implementation of GS in clinical care.
 Dr. Halley will achieve these aims by drawing on her current skills in ethnography and health services
research, as well as on additional training in biomedical ethics, genetic and genomic testing, and health
economics, to be carried out at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. Dr. Halley is already an
accomplished scholar with a track record of high-quality research. The proposed training and mentored
research will provide her with the additional knowledge and skills necessary to become an independent,
interdisciplinary researcher examining the ELSI of new genomic technologies, with a focus on the intersection
of medical anthropology, biomedical ethics, and health economics."
10817058,"SUMMARY
Despite recent advances in therapeutic strategies, the prognosis for patients with highly malignant brain tumors,
glioblastomas (GBM) remains poor, with a median survival of 12-19 months. Immunotherapy has emerged as a
promising approach for different cancer types. However, its efficacy in GBM has been limited primarily by overall
systemic immune suppression and the immune-suppressive tumor micro-environment. Recently, we have shown
CRISPR/Cas9 engineered self-targeting re-purposed cancer cells specifically home to tumor cells and release
targeted ligands that induce tumor cell killing which translates into survival benefits in mouse models of primary
and metastatic tumors. Based on our exciting studies, we have gene edited and subsequently engineered
syngeneic immunosuppressive GBM to express bi-functional immunomodulatory and cytotoxic protein, interferon
(IFN)β and granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor (GMCSF), which is known to induce both innate and
adaptive immunity. Our preliminary data reveal that repurposed immunosuppressive GBM cells do not proliferate
in vivo and elicit an active immunity which prevents tumor recurrence. These results although promising, have
raised fundamental questions for our tumor cell based gene edited therapy strategy to be characterized and
tested extensively in immunocompetent mouse tumor models that mimic clinical settings of immunosuppressive,
resected and recurrent immune-profiled GBM tumors. In this proposal, we will first develop and extensively
characterize a platform of gene edited and engineered syngeneic immunosuppressive and active GBM
therapeutic tumor cells (ThTC) and assess them for their mechanism based direct killing of parental GBM cells
and their ability to elicit active anti-tumor immunity in primary and recurrent mouse GBMs. Based on our previous
findings that GBM tumor resection promotes the recruitment of CD4/CD8 T cells and local delivery of synthetic
extracellular matrix (sECM) encapsulated immunomodulators has therapeutic efficacy, we will test sECM-ThTC
for their therapeutic efficacy in resected GBM mouse tumor models. We hypothesize that ThTC will lead to
specific killing of residual GBM cells in the tumor resection cavity of primary and recurrent GBMs and elicit active
immunity. To ease clinical translation, we will ultimately CRISPR/Cas9 gene edit and subsequently engineer
patient derived resected primary tumor cells (hTC) to express human IFN and GMCSF (hThTC). These hThTC
will be tested in recurrent GBM models generated from glioma stem cell (GSC) lines in humanized mice. The
integration of the safety kill switch, HSV-TK in ThTC will ensure safety in our approach and the incorporation of
genetically engineered imaging markers into both ThTC and GBMs will allow us to follow fate and efficacy in vivo
and thus to fine tune the proposed approaches. We anticipate that our findings will have a major contribution
towards developing novel ThTC based therapies for GBM and are likely to define a new treatment paradigm for
patients with other cancers."
10754574,"ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are two devastating
chronic lung diseases associated with aging and with a common environmental risk factor, cigarette smoking,
but with differing physiology and pathology, which may be due to genetics. Our group has led two large-scale
COPD genome-wide association studies (GWASs), identifying five loci (near FAM13A, DSP, MAPT-KANSL1,
ZKSCAN1, and STN1) where the genetic variant alleles associated with an increased COPD risk are associated
with a decreased IPF risk. These opposite risk loci may reside in regulatory elements that act as “molecular
switches” in disease-relevant cell types that impact gene expression to shunt biologic processes toward
producing a COPD or IPF end-phenotype. However, GWASs do not directly implicate the functional
consequence of genetic variants or the effector genes, cell types, or gene regulatory networks through which the
genetic variants are acting. MicroRNAs, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both COPD and IPF,
modulate gene expression levels and may impact the gene regulatory networks at the opposite risk loci. The
goal of this project is to define COPD/IPF opposite risk loci and describe the functional mechanisms, effector
genes, and relevant lung cell types through which these opposite risk loci are acting. We hypothesize that
opposite risk genetic loci for COPD and IPF are due to shared causal variants acting as molecular switches
through regulatory elements affecting gene expression in specific lung cell types. Furthermore, we hypothesize
that these molecular switches are marked by discrete microRNA and RNA differences as well as divergent gene
regulatory networks in COPD compared to IPF lung tissue. To address these hypotheses, we propose a series
of investigations starting by refining the five known COPD/IPF opposite risk loci and identifying new opposite risk
loci using expanded COPD and IPF GWASs and TOPMed WGS data. Next, we will perform joint single nucleus
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) and snRNA-seq in COPD and IPF lung
tissue from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) to predict the disease-specific and lung cell-type-
specific regulatory elements and effector genes at each of the COPD/IPF opposite risk loci. We will use CRISPR
interference genome editing in implicated cell types to functionally validated predicted relationships of regulatory
elements to effector genes. Next, we will generate microRNA sequencing data in IPF lung tissue from the LTRC
and build disease-specific gene regulatory networks integrating genetic, microRNA, and RNA data at each
opposite risk locus. We will highlight therapeutic opportunities by assessing these gene regulatory networks for
drug-related pathway enrichment. We will then examine the COPD- and IPF-related cellular phenotypes that
result from perturbations (CRISPR interference, CRISPR activation, and microRNA targeting) of the genes in
the opposite risk loci gene regulatory networks. This study will help define the pathobiology and improve our
understanding of the susceptibility for the two most deadly chronic lung diseases."
10754282,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 COVID-19 is associated with cognitive impairment that may persist long after infection. COVID-19 risk
factors overlap with those for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including older age, the APOE4 allele, and vascular
dysfunction, suggesting that pathology from one condition may exacerbate pathogenesis of the other. Blood-
brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may serve as a common pathogenic mechanism, as BBB breakdown has been
identified in individuals at risk for AD and may facilitate COVID-19-related neural injury via binding of SARS-
CoV-2 to cerebrovascular endothelial cells or via virally-mediated neuroinflammation. Sex is also a risk factor
for both diseases, with increased AD risk for women and sex-specific risk for acute and chronic COVID-19
symptoms, which may be partially mediated by sex hormone regulation of SARS-CoV-2 binding, inflammation,
immune activity, or BBB dysfunction. The intersection of latent AD neuropathology with neuroinflammation or
cerebrovascular dysfunction triggered by COVID-19 among the aging population may ignite a perfect storm of
neurodegenerative changes. Yet despite potential for convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic upon a pre-
existing public health crisis of dementia, little research has been devoted to understanding the mechanistic
overlap between these conditions or the potentially catastrophic public health consequences of their synergy.
 The proposed investigation will assess the neurobiological sequalae of COVID-19 in older adults along with
their modification by sex, AD pathology, and AD genetic risk. Restriction spectrum imaging to measure brain
microstructure and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to estimate BBB permeability will be conducted on adults
aged 50 years or older with previous COVID-19 infection (CV) and disease-related cognitive impairment, and
on uninfected healthy controls. Cognitive testing will be conducted at time of neuroimaging and annually for up
to four additional years. AD polygenic hazard scores (PHS), estrogen and testosterone levels, and plasma p-
tau181, will be measured for all participants, and lifetime estrogen exposure will be calculated for women. This
project will test the hypotheses that CV exhibit greater BBB breakdown, microstructural damage, and more
severe cognitive impairment and decline than controls (Aim 1). AD risk (Aim 2) and sex (Aim 3) are predicted
to modify effects of COVID-19 on brain and cognitive measures, with more severe disease-related brain injury,
BBB permeability, and cognitive decline for those with high PHS or abnormal p-tau181 and for women. In sex-
stratified analyses, testosterone and estrogen are expected to correlate with brain injury, BBB breakdown, and
cognitive deficits (Aim 3). This study will pioneer the most advanced diffusion and permeability MRI techniques
to clarify the yet elusive neurobiological effects of COVID-19 underlying its cognitive symptoms in older adults
at elevated risk for neurodegenerative changes. It will advance our understanding of the currently speculative
synergy between COVID-19 and AD pathogenesis as well as the complex role of sex and hormonal regulation
in COVID-19-related neurological sequalae."
10804610,"Alcohol misuse is a leading cause of human misery, morbidity, and mortality. Existing treatments are far from
curative. While the roots of alcohol misuse are complex and multifactorial, Anxiety plays a key role. Models of
addiction suggest that many drinkers misuse alcohol to relieve excess anxiety (‘self-medicate’). Anxiety-related
states, traits, and disorders increase the odds of alcohol use and problems, and these associations are magnified
among individuals who habitually use alcohol for relief. Recent research motivates the hypothesis that anxiety-
fueled alcohol misuse reflects hyper-reactivity to Uncertain Threat, the prototypical trigger of anxiety. Yet several
key gaps in our understanding remain: (G1) There have been no systematic, well-powered efforts to test the
relevance of Uncertain Threat circuitry to dimensional variation in alcohol misuse, impeding the development of
more effective or tolerable therapeutics. Prior imaging studies have largely focused on cortical regions. The
relevance of subcortical regions implicated in animal models of addiction and anxiety remains unclear. (G2)
Computational psychiatry recognizes 2 distinct kinds of uncertainty: Risk and Ambiguity. Which of these is more
relevant to alcohol misuse remains unexplored, thwarting the development of precision treatments. (G3)
Preclinical work has identified a distributed brain circuit that is sensitive to Uncertain Threat, but it remains
unknown which components of this circuit are most relevant to anxiety-fueled craving and consumption in the
real world. To address these questions, we will recruit a racially diverse community sample of 240 AUD+ adults,
over-sampling those who use alcohol for anxiety relief. Parametric threat-anticipation paradigms will allow us to
probe circuits sensitive to categorical and dimensional variation in threat uncertainty. Smartphone phenotyping
will assess real-world threat exposure, threat uncertainty, anxiety, craving, and alcohol use. These data will
enable us to address 3 aims. (A1) Identify the brain regions and facets of threat uncertainty most relevant to
clinical variation in alcohol use, symptoms, and problems. (A2) Use smartphone technology to pinpoint
modifiable factors—including alterations in perceived threat and anxiety—that trigger craving and consumption.
(A3) Fusing the fMRI and smartphone data-streams will allow us to fractionate the Uncertain Threat circuit and
pinpoint the components most relevant to anxiety-fueled alcohol misuse in the real world—an aim that cannot
be addressed using either tool in isolation. This integrative approach promises to bridge levels of analysis and
has never been applied to alcohol misuse. Summary: AUD is notoriously heterogeneous, with >2,000 unique
clinical profiles. Our focus on a theoretically coherent set of dimensional measures in a diverse, clinically relevant
sample promises to overcome this barrier and provide fresh insights into the underlying neurobiology. Building
on well-established negative reinforcement models and a fruitful line of psychophysiological research, this study
will provide a potentially transformative opportunity to identify new treatment targets; guide the development of
new translational models; and inform the development of new digital interventions."
10808153,"Project Summary
Developing sustainable approaches to the synthesis of molecular therapeutics will be important for the
continued evolution and success of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistries. A major component of
drug synthesis involves transition metal catalyzed C–X (X = C, N, O, etc.) bond formation reactions.
While precious metals such as Pd are used for these reactions, first row transition metals are becoming
more widely adopted, as they are abundant and open new mechanistic pathways involving one- and
multi-electron transfer reactivity, which can potentially work in concert with ligand noninnocence and
multireference electronic structure to form transformative structure/function relationships. The merger
of thermal catalysis with photochemistry also provides new mechanistic possibilities for cross-couplings
that harness the energy of light to drive bond-formation reactions that would not occur in ground states.
However, the nature of inorganic intermediates and the important ultrafast transition metal excited state
relaxation processes in ground and excited state cross-coupling reactions are not well understood. This
proposal therefore applies physical inorganic approaches to develop a fundamental knowledge base
of the geometric and electronic structures of the critical inorganic species formed in Cu- and Ni-
catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, as well as the time and energy evolution of photoinduced electronic
states involved in excited state catalysis. This knowledge base will ultimately guide the development of
a molecular engineering approach to ligand development and catalyst discovery. We will bring new
spectroscopic methods to the field, including variable temperature variable field magnetic circular
dichroism (VTVH MCD) and X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies, which will be critical to
quantitatively define transition metal electronic structure, including multireference character. Ultrafast
optical and X-ray spectroscopic approaches will also be used to define the key photonic energy
distribution pathways that define photocatalyst efficiency and further guide ligand perturbations to
control the excited state potential energy surfaces (PESs) of photocatalysts. Spectral features of
isolable species will be used to experimentally calibrate computational methods to define the critical
frontier molecular orbitals and bonding interactions that activate metal centers for reactivity, especially
those that are fleeting but critical to catalysis. Electronic structure calculations will also allow for the
translation of our understanding of resting states, intermediates, and excited states to reaction
coordinates in catalysis and the PESs governing relaxation pathways. In concert with collaborative
methodological studies, the proposed research will help inform chemists how to leverage the ground
and excited state electronic structures of first-row transition metal complexes and thus guide academic
and industry research toward sustainable approaches for bond constructions in drug synthesis."

Project 2 (Zeitler): Identifying Disparities in Care of Rural Patients with Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices
Patients in rural settings have significantly worse outcomes from cardiovascular conditions compared with
patients in non-rural settings, including treatment of arrhythmias with a cardiac implantable electronic device
(CIED), like a pacemaker or defibrillator. These ubiquitous implantable devices store copious amounts of
medical information related to device function and disease progression, among other items. These data are
available to treating physicians and other clinicians through remote monitoring (RM), which relies on wireless
connectivity between patients, a remote server, health care facilities, and treating physicians. Monitoring of
patients with a CIED through this RM paradigm as an adjunct to periodic in-person evaluations has been
associated with a variety of improved outcomes over in-person evaluations alone, ranging from improvements
in patient satisfaction to decreased mortality. Thus, RM is unequivocally recommended in combination with in-
person evaluations. While known disparities in RM exist among the uninsured and elderly, the geographic
distribution of RM remains unstudied.
A number of factors suggest that RM of CIEDs may be particularly vulnerable to geographic disparities. For
one, patients in rural areas face greater barriers to connectivity, including less access to high-speed internet
and less-consistent cell phone coverage. These barriers couple with the challenge of greater geographic
distances that must be traveled to access in-person subspecialty services, a necessary aspect of CIED care.
With the guidance of a community engagement studio, the proposed work incorporates mixed methods to: 1)
better understand barriers and facilitators of RM in rural areas; 2) identify geographic disparities in CIED care;
and 3) exploit variation in RM referral networks to understand characteristics associated with optimal CIED
care in rural areas. These efforts will be informed and supported by expert input from the Statistics,
Informatics, and Qualitative Methods Core to evaluate variation in health care delivery and outcomes, as well
as the deep experience in community engagement and qualitative research methods represented by the
Community Engagement and Outreach Core. Findings from this research will constitute meaningful progress
towards addressing geographic disparities in arrhythmia care while, enabling achievement of investigator
independence."
10931331,"Abstract
Despite a notable 32.7% decline in mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD) since 1999, the prevalence of
stable angina has not decreased. Stable angina is defined as predictable chest pain on exertion or under
mental or emotional stress. Stable angina signifies partial obstruction of coronary flow or microvascular
changes and comes with substantial lifetime consequences including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, reinfarction,
and cardiac arrest. Nearly 9 million Americans have stable angina and heart disease is now the leading
disability-adjusted disease globally. Stable angina is associated with multiple symptoms, impaired functional
status, and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aims of this randomized controlled trial are to
test the efficacy of acupuncture for stable angina/chest pain syndrome on pain and symptom control, health-
related quality of life, healthcare utilization, PROMIS measured patient health outcomes and to describe the
duration of the acupuncture treatment and placebo effects for up to 12 weeks. One hundred twelve patients
hospitalized with IHD and experiencing symptoms of stable angina will be recruited from 2 academic medical
centers. Those with a confirmed diagnosis of stable angina, experiencing symptoms at least once per week,
and treated with medical therapy for at least 1 month, will be randomly assigned to acupuncture or an attention
control group. Participants in the acupuncture group will receive a standardized Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM) point prescription. Acupuncture will be administered 2 times per week for 5 weeks for a total of 10
treatments. The attention control group will view non-pain related TED Talk videos over 5 weeks approximately
equal to the 10 hours of treatment for the acupuncture group. The participants will then meet with research
staff to answer questions related to the videos. Upon completion of the study, the attention control group will be
offered the same acupuncture protocol as the intervention group at no charge. The McGill Pain Questionnaire
and the American Heart Association (AHA) Angina Log will be used to measure pain location, intensity, quality,
pattern and associated symptoms. Froelicher’s Healthcare Utilization Questionnaire-Rev. will be used to
assess healthcare use. The Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7 will be used to measure symptoms other than
pain, functional status, and HRQoL. The PROMIS-29v2 will assess patient-reported health outcomes.
Participants will complete measures of anginal pain (pain now, worst pain, & pain since the last session) and
the AHA Angina Log before each acupuncture treatment. Pain will be measured after each treatment.
Research staff will contact participants weekly for up to 12 weeks or until pain returns to baseline to assess the
frequency and severity of anginal attacks. The outcome variables of pain, symptoms, functional status,
healthcare utilization, HRQoL, and PROMIS health outcomes will be analyzed using mixed regression models
to determine the efficacy of acupuncture. Symptom management is critical for reducing disability and improving
health outcomes for those with angina."
10867359,"Aging is associated with loss of lung structure and declining function. Emphysematous loss of tissue structure
is exacerbated by vasculopathy, which increases susceptibility to lung disease, and limits survival. We have
previously demonstrated that the structure and function of the lung microvasculature is regulated by a
specialized mesenchymal vascular progenitor cell (MVPC). We have also defined Dickkopf-related protein
1 (DKK1) as a regulator of this niche in murine and human model. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
MVPC numbers decline with age in WT mice by 1 year, and that, when MVPC are depleted in young mice,
lung aging is accelerated, resulting in severe emphysema at 1.5 years of age. While MVPC are key modulators
of the pulmonary microvasculature in the distal lung, adventitial stem cells (ASC) influence large blood vessel
homeostasis in the proximal lung. Our preliminary data identifies key similarities between MVPCs and ASCs
suggesting that decline in ASC numbers and function may also result in accelerated lung aging. Given ASC
function is tightly controlled by lung-resident type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and pulmonary ILC2 are
known to decrease with age, loss of ASC-ILC2 crosstalk is likely a contributor to emphysema. Similar to aging,
vascular remodeling is driven by chronic activation of type 2 (Th2) inflammation. Our preliminary data support
increased Th2 cytokine profiles in plasma and BAL of COPD patients. Human and murine scRNAseq data
define ILC2 and MVPC populations as well as immune cell infiltrate and cytokine expression characteristic of
Th2 inflammation in COPD and a smoking model. The goal of this proposal is to define the mechanisms that
result in loss of adult MVPC and ILC2 progenitor function contributing to accelerated lung aging, by altering
vascular structure and function, and increased susceptibility to emphysema in the aged population. We
hypothesize that loss of progenitor function accelerates lung aging by altering cell interactions within vascular
niches, promoting vascular remodeling and increasing susceptibility to emphysema in the aging population. We
will test that decline in MVPC and ILC2 numbers and/or function in the aging lung accelerates aging via
impairment of vascular homeostasis due to disruption of cell – cell interactions in their respective perivascular
niches, promoting vascular remodeling and loss of tissue structure using novel conditional murine models to
knock down progenitors in aged mice or young mice. We will assess the requirement of MVPC, MVPC derived
DKK1, ILC2 cells, and ILC2 derived IL13 in the maintenance of vascular niche homeostasis and susceptibility
to emphysema. We will use conditional models to manipulate DKK1 or IL13 expression in mice allowed to age
in the presence or absence of cigarette smoke exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Lastly, we will test that loss of
ILC2 and MVPC progenitors promotes lung aging and is associated with COPD and a type-2 immune
endotype. This work will provide an understanding of progenitor aging, mechanisms by which loss of MVPC
and ILC2 function drives vascular remodeling with a Th2 endotype contributing to lung aging and emphysema."

Established in 2003, the NSRRC is meeting the needs of the swine medical research community. The
NSRRC provides a central repository service to the swine research community by importing, storing, and
distributing swine biological resources. Not only does it assure that valuable models are preserved and are
freely available, it allows researchers to satisfy NIH requirements for resource sharing, relieves the
distribution burden from individual investigators, and provides genetic and health quality control. The
NSRRC has served the NIH swine community over the past 3 ½ years by doing the following: creating 25
new models; importing 12 new models; rederiving pigs into the high health NSRRC building; cryopreserving
gamete, embryo, and male and female somatic cell samples; distributing cells, tissues, organs or pigs to 73
investigators at 43 different institutions; providing training opportunities to undergraduates, graduate
students, resident veterinarians, and visiting scientists; and sponsoring workshops that promote the use of
pigs in research. During the funding period, the NSRRC will continue to: import existing swine models of
human health and disease; rederive pigs to eliminate pathogens and health monitoring to assure
maintenance of a specific pathogen-free status; cryopreserve and store gametes, embryos, and both male
and female somatic cells to prevent future loss of valuable models; distribute expertise, reagents, cells,
tissues, organs, and specific pathogen-free pigs; use state of the art techniques to create new genetically
engineered pigs needed by the medical research community; and serve as a site for training and
educational activities related to research employing swine models."

10577555,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis affect more than 100 million people worldwide every year,
despite the existence of treatment and prevention methods. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance will
curtail our ability to effectively manage these infections, making it critical to expand our knowledge of Neisseria
biology. Commensal Neisseria provide a tool by which we can dissect one common but poorly understood
facet of pathogenic Neisseria behavior, asymptomatic infection. N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis
descended from a commensal ancestor and share many host interaction factors with human adapted
commensal Neisseria. The central hypothesis of this application proposes that the mechanistic roots of
Neisseria asymptomatic infection are commensal in origin, and that the study of conserved host interaction
factors provides insight into commensal colonization and asymptomatic infection alike. To test this, I utilize a
mouse-Neisseria model of asymptomatic carriage to systematically evaluate a subset of conserved host
interaction factors, guided by preliminary data obtained from a transposon mutagenesis and screening
approach. In Aim 1, I examine the impact of Type IV pilus retraction during host modulation and inter-bacterial

10808891,"ABSTRACT
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic cancer in the US. Incidence is increasing, especially
for aggressive, understudied tumors that confer poor prognosis and are more often seen in African Americans
(AAs). EC has one of the largest survival disparities of all cancers: AAs have >2-fold higher mortality vs. other
racial/ethnic groups. The disparity remains after accounting for stage, histology, comorbidities, and treatment.
The etiology of aggressive tumors and 2-fold survival disparity are large knowledge gaps in EC. The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) achieved milestones in clarifying endometrial tumor biology. Using exome sequence
data, TCGA defined 4 new tumor subtypes with prognostic significance and showed these data can refine
subtype classification beyond classic histology. But TCGA used mostly good prognosis endometrioid tumors
(>90%) and tumors in white women—with only 46 AAs—to define these subtypes. Our pilot analysis of AA vs.
non-AA tumors in these sparse data suggested AAs more often had mutational features suggestive of poor
outcomes. We hypothesize somatic differences in AA vs. non-AA tumors may help explain the large survival
disparity. Here, we will use the largest, most diverse population to date—including 1,011 AA and 2,043 non-AA
cases in the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium (E2C2)—to study genomic variation across the
full spectrum of endometrial tumors, distinct risk factor profiles across tumor types, and the role of underlying
tumor biology in driving the 2-fold survival disparity. We will: define the mutational landscape and novel
tumor subtypes using whole-exome sequence data in 3,054 endometrial tumors and compare these in
AA vs. non-AA cases. This will use exhaustive genomic profiling of point mutations, indels, and copy number
alterations. Next, we will identify differences in risk factor associations by tumor molecular subtypes in
3,054 cases and 3,054 matched controls. Despite many known EC risk factors, TCGA was not designed to
study these in concert with somatic changes. We will combine tumor profiling data in cases with information on
known germline genetic and epidemiologic risk factors in cases and controls to study distinct risk factor profiles
by tumor subtypes. Finally, we will 3) determine the extent to which tumor molecular subtypes explain the
2-fold survival disparity in AA and non-AA cases: Having characterized tumor genomes, we will use
mediation analysis to determine the extent to which tumor molecular profiles in AAs and non-AAs explain the
survival disparity. Leveraging E2C2 resources and collaborations, we will characterize the biology and risk
profiles of the component subtypes of EC, including aggressive tumors, and somatic differences that drive the
survival disparity. Long-term this can lead to refined risk prediction tools, improved targeting of disease
prevention and treatment, and strategies to reduce longstanding racial disparities in mortality. Our study will
also build a unique platform on which to perform future population-based -omics studies of EC."
10775795,"Interactions of the gut microbiota with cells of the immune system govern multiple physiological functions that
are manifested locally, in the regulation of intestinal barrier functions, and systemically, in autoimmune
diseases and modulation of anti-tumor immunity. Although mutualistic microbial species generally provide vital
health benefits to the host, some of them can conditionally cause harm under some circumstances, such as
host genetic vulnerabilities or following environmental perturbation. These bacterial species, known as
“pathobionts”, have been proposed to be major contributors to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as
ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which are characterized by intestinal dysbiosis. A better characterization
of these bacterial species and the mechanisms by which they interact with the host in healthy homeostatic
conditions and during IBD-associated inflammation is critical for developing better therapeutic approaches. We
study the model pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus, which induces regulatory T cells (iTreg) in the healthy
murine gut, but promotes Th17-mediated inflammation when the iTregs are compromised. H. hepaticus-
specific naïve T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in colon-draining mesenteric lymph
nodes (mLN), and up-regulate Foxp3 and RORgt, transcription factors characteristic of intestinal iTreg.
However, when IL-10 is limiting or when iTreg induction is otherwise compromised, the microbe-specific T cells
express RORgt and adopt a pathogenic (p)Th17 cell program in the lamina propria. The goals of this proposal
are to identify the APCs that interact with naïve H. hepaticus-specific T cells in the mLN to program either iTreg
or pTh17 differentiation pathways, elucidate the molecules involved and the temporal dynamics of the APC-T
cell interactions, and determine the roles of the diverse types of MHC class II-expressing cells in the intestinal
lamina propria in promoting iTreg and pTh17 cell functions. In preliminary studies, we found that selective loss
of either CCR7 in dendritic cells (DCs) or MHC-II in type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) resulted in abrogation
of iTreg cell differentiation and in expansion, instead, of pTh17 cells in mLN and lamina propria. A similar iTreg
phenotype was observed when molecules involved in TGF-b release were mutated in DCs or ILC3, suggesting
that regulated local release of this iTreg-inducing cytokine requires naïve T cells to interact with both DCs and
ILC3. Our first aim is to precisely characterize, through genetic and transcriptomic approaches, the cell types
required for iTreg induction in the mLN, and rule out potential for misinterpretation due to expression of Cre in
rare uncharacterized APCs or to indirect effects of the cell type-restricted mutations; and determine the
spatiotemporal interactions of the cells, using multiphoton microscopy. The second aim is to identify the CCR7-
independent APC(s) required for pTh17 cell induction in settings of compromised iTreg induction. The third aim
is to leverage the H. hepaticus-specific system to investigate potential non-T cell priming functions of diverse
MHC-II-expressing cell types in the intestinal lamina propria, including epithelial and endothelial cells."
10733456,"Summary: Mechanisms coordinating the local and systemic resistance to pathogens.
Defending a host against pathogens to ensure homeostasis and health requires the coordinated effort of multiple
cell types. Many pathogens that enter the host via a specific tissue portal can often disseminate to multiple
tissues over time and cause significant damage to additional host organs. Cells of the innate and adaptive
immune system respond to the initial infection as well as disseminated infection to mount robust defense against
both phases of pathogen attack. Importantly, in some cases, dissemination is delayed from the primary infection.
Intuitively, if the eventual sites of disseminated infection were immunologically prepared to expect the arrival of
potential infection from the primary site of pathogen growth, the host would be better able to control systemic
disease. Significantly, the preliminary data leading to this proposal suggests that such a mechanism for long
range coordination between local dendritic cells (DC) and distant stromal cells operates via a hitherto
unappreciated pathway for making the heterodimeric cytokine IL-12. We hypothesize that pathogen-activated
Dendritic Cells at the original site of infection secrete inert IL-12p40 monomers which circulate to distant organs,
combine with IL-12p35 released locally by stromal cells to tailor tissue-specific anticipatory immunity. This long-
distance combination of inert subunits of IL-12 within tissue niches allows individual sites to not only prime the
immune cells in that microenvironment in anticipation of potential infection, but also fine-tune immunity in a
tissue-specific fashion (e.g. by releasing the protein IL-23p19 instead of IL-12p35, which would lead to the local
assembly of IL-23 and eventual amplification of type17 immunity instead of type1).
In this proposal, we evaluate the molecular, cellular and systems level mechanisms of this hypothesis using
three independent and convergent Specific Aims (SA).
SA1: examines the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the release of both subunits (P40 and P35)
as well as the principles which facilitate their tissue-level assembly into IL-12. DC subsets producing P40,
selective mechanisms favoring monomer release and adaptations allowing tissue retention will be dissected.
Tissue signals initiating P35 release as well as significance for P19 (the P40-partner responsible for IL-23) will
also be evaluated.
SA2: studies how host defense is facilitated by the innovative concept of Immunological premonition in tissues
at a cellular level. Immune cells that respond to locally assembled IL-12 and the duration of the immune
modifications resulting from this will be measured in the context of immunizations as well as infectious challenge.
SA3: defines the systemic consequences of immunological premonition by using a physiological co-infection
model. Organisms that can modify local vs systemic P40 are expected to be natural part of our host-microbe
relationships. We will measure responses to acute infections in the presence of bacteria with defined impact on
local IL-12 to understand how immunity at primary and distal sites are coordinated to effect optimal host defense
to multiple pathogens in parallel.
Taken together, we expect these studies to be transformative by revealing the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying a critical inter-tissue communication and coordination axis in host defense. Future
studies can develop clinical therapeutics targeting these pathways to improve tissue-specific immunity from
vaccines administered at distant sites, reducing systemic immunopathology from local infections, and improving
host resistance to pathogen dissemination or colonization."
10800665,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemochorial placentation occurs in many mammalian species including primates and rodents. It ensures the
most intimate contact between maternal and embryonic compartments and requires specialized adjustments.
Among these adjustments is the need for extensive remodeling of the maternal uterine spiral arteries. Uterine
vascular modifications are required for the delivery of nutrients to the fetus. Mechanisms controlling uterine
spiral artery remodeling remain poorly understood. Central to the vascular remodeling process is a specialized
population of trophoblast cells referred to as invasive trophoblast cells (generic term) or alternatively as
extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells (human-specific term). Impairments in differentiation of the invasive
trophoblast/EVT cell lineage, intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion, and/or trophoblast cell-directed uterine cell
modulation contribute to early pregnancy loss, placental dysfunction, pregnancy-related diseases, and a range
of postnatal health issues. Our long-term goal is to elucidate regulatory processes controlling development of
the invasive trophoblast/EVT cell lineage and their role in establishing the uterine-placental interface.
Placentation in the human and rat are both characterized by deep intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion and
extensive trophoblast cell guided spiral artery remodeling. Our research strategy is based on our prior
establishment and extensive characterization of in vitro and in vivo models for studying deep hemochorial
placentation in the rat and the utilization of human placentation site specimens and human trophoblast stem
cells for investigating gene regulatory networks controlling EVT cell development. In this proposal we focus on
two regulatory pathways controlling invasive trophoblast/EVT cell differentiation: i) phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway; ii) CBP/EP300-interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp rich carboxy-terminal
domain 2 (CITED2)-regulated pathway. These regulatory pathways are viewed as entry points and guides to
mechanisms controlling development of the invasive trophoblast/EVT cell lineage. The proposed research
provides an innovative approach to studying deep hemochorial placentation. Collectively, the research is
directed toward elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying physiologically relevant processes that ensure
successful hemochorial placentation. This approach will lead to the identification of conserved regulatory
pathways controlling the invasive trophoblast/EVT cell lineage, which will create opportunities and a platform for
understanding the pathogenesis of placental anomalies leading to pregnancy disorders."
10805382,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite recent advances in early detection and treatment, breast cancer remains a major cause of morbidity
and mortality. Native Hawaiian women have the highest breast cancer incidence in Hawaii despite their
favorably reproductive patterns. Japanese American women now experience the same breast cancer risk as
non-Hispanic White women Further, advanced breast cancer rates are considerably higher in Asian American
Women in Hawaii and the Pacific compared to the US mainland, 15% versus 9%. The absolute risk of invasive
cancer and advanced cancer in these groups of the US population is not known. Our long-term goal is to
develop accurate and validated breast cancer risk biomarkers that can contribute to screening strategies for
Asian groups with diverse breast cancer risk profiles who to date have not been well represented in breast
cancer cohorts and clinical trials. The Hawaii Pacific Islands Mammography Registry (HIPIMR) will be a
resource to identify and validate novel image biomarkers for the diverse ethnic groups of this region with
varying risk factor profiles including Native Hawaiians, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and other ethnic groups.
Combining San Francisco Mammography Registry and HIPIMR cohorts will give us the statistical power to
describe risk of invasive and advanced cancer in Asian groups. Our central hypothesis is that standard breast
cancer risk factors and image factors and their prevalence are different in the diverse populations found in high
concentrations in the Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa) and Asian ethnic groups in the mainland US
compared to non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women. We plan to test the hypothesis that
using risk factor profiles and next generation breast composition and texture features across Asian groups, the
fastest growing segment of the US population,9 and NHPI ethnic groups will improve cancer risk prediction.
Our specific aims are as compared to non-Hispanic White women: 1. Examine clinical risk factors and their
association with invasive and advanced breast cancer in women undergoing breast cancer screening by Asian
(Japanese, Filipino, Chinese) and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander (AANHPI) ancestry, 2. Identify next-
generation breast imaging characteristics from 2D and 3D mammography, including volumetric breast density,
calcifications, masses, texture features and their association with invasive and advanced breast cancer for
AANHPI women, using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, 3. Identify the
combination of clinical risk factors and image factors associated with invasive and advanced breast cancer risk
among AANHPI women. This study addresses the need for accurate identification of defined clinical and
radiomic risk factors among AANHPI populations and their relation to breast cancer risk to improve outcomes
for these women."
10765620,"ABSTRACT
Retrotransposons are the most abundant genetic elements in almost all animal cells, making up 38% of the
human genome. Their activation inherently leads to DNA damage and mutations, and this activity is increasingly
appreciated to cause numerous human diseases. Despite their abundance and fundamental impacts on host
physiology and pathology, the study of retrotransposons remains an underexplored area of biomedical research.
Using new tools and technologies developed by my team, in the long-term, we aim to understand how
retrotransposon activity is developmentally regulated, and what are the function and impact of their
developmental activation to the hosts under physiological and pathological conditions.
Our early progress revealed an unexpected convergence among developmental retrotransposon activation, host
immunity, and antiviral response. These results lead to our central hypothesis that developmentally programed
retrotransposon activation primes the immune system to grant the hosts a long-term protection against future
pathogen infections. Toward this hypothesis, we have discovered that Gypsy retrotransposon selectively
becomes active in the newly regenerating tissues during Drosophila metamorphosis. We have also found that
Gypsy activation triggers the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), the effectors of innate immunity.
Excitingly, we further learned that suppressing Gypsy activation during metamorphosis leads flies to succumb
to viral infection at adulthood. Guided by these strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific
Aims to characterize this Gypsy activation mechanism and to uncover how Gypsy signals AMP production and
ultimately promotes an antiviral response: (1) Characterize how Gypsy activity is regulated during animal
development. (2) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Gypsy activation primes host innate immunity.
(3) Define the long-term impact of Gypsy activation on combating pathogens.
Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by identifying new mechanisms that control
retrotransposons and characterizing the influence of retrotransposon on host immunity. Given that the activation
of retrotransposon likely contributes to inflammation in neurodegenerative disease and increases
immunogenicity of cancer cells, our findings will potentially provide new perspectives to harness them for treating
related diseases."

Education and training have been central to the mission of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) throughout its
existence. The ACC Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) component coordinates
ACC cancer-related education, training, and career activities. In this role, CRTEC integrates these activities
across the Penn campus, including the ACC, the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM), and nine other Penn
Schools that have activities with cancer education and training content. A prime focus of CRTEC is to drive and
promote cancer education and training activities in the ACC and across the University of Pennsylvania with the
goals of delivering cancer-related education to students, trainees, faculty, and other professionals and
expanding and diversifying the cancer workforce through targeted education, training, and mentorship. The
Specific Aims of CRTEC are as follows: Aim 1: Coordinate cancer education, training, and career development
activities across the ACC and Penn; Aim 2: Provide cancer research-related education, training, and
mentorship to individuals ranging from high school and undergraduate students to cancer professionals, with
an emphasis on ensuring a diverse and enduring pipeline of trainees and future cancer researchers; and Aim
3: Evaluate the quality and impact of ACC CRTEC activities to improve ACC education/training and to guide
new CRTEC developments. CRTEC impacts students, trainees, and professionals with a goal to advance
cancer research careers starting with entry-level professional training through faculty and cancer research
leadership roles. CRTEC is led by an ACC Associate Director for Education and Training, senior support staff,
and an Operations Committee. It interacts with the Programs, Shared Resources, and Community Outreach
and Engagement. CRTEC impacts the ACC by (1) coordinating the already diverse, well-established, and
extensive cancer-related education and training activities at the ACC and Penn; (2) improving access to
cancer-related education for students, trainees, staff, and professionals; (3) sustaining cancer career
development through integrated cancer-related training and mentoring for faculty, trainees, and staff; and (4)
enhancing diversity at all levels of education and training. CRTEC leverages formidable strengths at ACC and
Penn in cancer education and training that include a compact, accessible, and highly integrated campus with
extraordinary depth in all disciplines relevant to cancer research; longstanding cancer-focused education in the
ACC, PSOM and other Schools; a uniquely large and diverse portfolio of GME and biomedical postdoctoral
training programs, many with decades of NCI and other funding; extensive ACC-directed professional
education; and expertise and national leadership in basic, translational, clinical, and population-based cancer
research. CRTEC provides ACC members with a central point of contact for innovations in cancer-related
education and training."
10767241,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enhancers are an important class of noncoding loci regulating gene expression and play important roles in
modulating diverse phenotypes and disease states. However, our understanding of the role of enhancers in
phenotypic evolution is limited and we lack a detailed understanding of the relationship between sequence
change within and between species, epigenetic states and variation in enhancer function. Moreover, we have
few statistical models that allow researchers to connect evolutionary changes in enhancer sequences within
and between species to phenotypic variation, and we often cannot unambiguously determine the causes of
observed changes in evolutionary rate of enhancers along lineages. Finally, most studies of enhancer
evolution thus far have studied only small numbers of enhancers and genome-wide assays of enhancer
variation and function are rare. Here we propose to develop statistical models linking phylogenetic patterns of
enhancer evolution with phenotypic variation between species, and to leverage within-species variation across
multiple species – “comparative population genomics” – to disentangle the sources of rate changes observed
in enhancers across species. We will also functionally test diverse enhancers on a large-scale, using the
developing fore- and hindlimb of volant and flightless birds as a model of development and gene expression.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will extend a recently developed Bayesian phylogenetic model for detecting rate
changes in noncoding DNA, phyloAcc, to improve its biological realism by incorporating stochastic gene tree
heterogeneity and the ability to associate sequence change with both binary and continuous traits. Building on
a novel data set of comparative gene expression and chromatin states across multiple species and
developmental stages, we will also develop methods to associate genome-wide variation in chromatin states
between species with binary and continuous traits. In Aim 2 we will develop additional statistical models to
leverage information from sequence variation within species to better understand the evolutionary forces
contributing to rate variation in noncoding DNA observed between species. The models developed in Aims 1
and 2 will be refined and made available to the broader community in a user-friendly format for use on diverse
systems and species. In Aim 3 we will functionally validate large numbers of candidate enhancers identified in
Aims 1 and 2 as having evolved new functions or found in altered chromatin states in the developing fore- and
hindlimb of volant and flightless birds. Using high-throughput assays in chicken, emu and other birds we will
study the relationship between within- and between-species sequence variation of enhancers and their ability
to drive gene expression. Together these aims will provide a number of tools that will benefit the community of
researchers using comparative genomics to understand links between genotype and phenotype, and will
extend the kinds of phenotypic traits and genomic signatures that will inform this emerging paradigm."
10764195,"PROJECT SUMMARY – IL-27-producing B cells in the antibody response
Built on our novel findings that B cells can be induced to express high levels of IL-27 (IL27p28/EBI3 heterodimer),
this proposal will explore molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the role of IL-27 and IL-27-producing B
cells (B-27 cells) in class-switched antibody (Ab) responses. As we contend, B-27 cells shape the magnitude
and quality of T-dependent Ab responses, including those elicited by viral infections. As we also contend, they
do so as “helper” B cells to enhance the function of their target “effector” B cells, i.e., those responding to antigens
and differentiating into IgG-producing cells. Such class-switched Abs include IgG1, which directly neutralizes
virus, and human IgG3 and mouse IgG2a/IgG2c (IgG2a), which have additional anti-viral effector functions.
Owing to the unique requirement of both innate and adaptive immune receptor signals for their induction, B-27
cells are strategically positioned to mediate the potent effect of TLR ligands in boosting the Ab response.
 We hypothesize that B-27 cells are induced in a manner dependent on transcription factor BATF3, and
optimize the Ab response by cooperating with IFNg to promote proliferation, survival and full differentiation of
IgG-producing B cells. This is based on our compelling preliminary data indicating that: (i) as an important
source of IL-27, B cells are induced to produce IL-27 after priming by TLR ligands and then stimulation by Tfh
cell stimuli CD154 and IL-21; (ii) mice with B cell-specific deficiency in Il27p28, Ebi3 or Batf3 are impaired in
IL-27 production and specific IgG2a responses; (iii) IL-27 activates STATs, directs CSR to IgG2a and promotes
survival and plasma cell differentiation in B cells stimulated by CD154 and IL-21 in vitro; and (iv) IL-27 and IFNg
together boost B cell growth and differentiation in vitro, and, conversely, combined IL-27R and IFNgR deficiency
in B cells abrogates specific IgG2a responses and significantly impairs IgG1 responses in vivo.
 To test our hypothesis, we will (Aim 1) characterize B-27 cells induced in Tg(Il27p28-Gfp) reporter mice upon
infection by vaccinia virus (VV), which is also used as a vector of a variety of vaccines, or immunization with
conjugated hapten NP-CGG mixed with alum and TLR ligand LPS; and determine the cooperation of B-27 cells
with IFNg in specific IgG responses and underlying effector B cell proliferation, survival, CSR/SHM, plasma cell
and memory B cell differentiation. We will also (Aim 2) address the mechanisms underlying the role of BATF3
in Il27p28 induction by identifying its cis-elements in the Il27p28 locus and partner transcription factors in vitro;
and analyze induction of B cell BATF3 and its impact on B-27 cell generation and Ab responses to VV infection
and NP-CGG/alum/LPS in vivo. Finally, we will (Aim 3) analyze the cooperation of B-cell IL-27R and IFNgR
signals in optimizing effector B cell growth and differentiation in response to VV infection in vivo and stimulation
with CD154 and IL-21 in vitro; and address the underlying mechanisms, focusing on their synergy in regulating
STAT signal outputs and gene expression. By unveiling the mechanisms and function of B-27 cells, our studies
will have a sustained impact on the understanding of IgG responses to viral infections and vaccine development."
10783051,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Since 2010, U.S. life expectancy improvements have stalled and in certain years declined. Much
attention to this stall has focused on the role of rising drug overdose deaths. In published work, however, our
team has identified stagnating declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality to be the major culprit. A
failure to improve CVD mortality puts the U.S. at risk for sustained declines in inter-generational life
expectancy. However, to date, research has not identified why U.S. CVD mortality is stagnating and, for some
age groups, increasing. Using novel approaches, we will investigate four hypotheses for stagnating CVD
mortality: (a) rising obesity and the resulting increase in CVD risk at a national level, (b) plateauing declines in
cigarette smoking, (c) survivor effects attributable to improved survival among those with a history of a CVD
event, and (d) rising levels of socio-economic vulnerability and geographic disparities.
 Aim 1 identifies the role that changes in obesity (Aim 1a) and cigarette smoking levels (Aim 1b) are
having on national-level CVD mortality. We will reconstruct cohort histories of obesity to model the aggregate
effects of both current and earlier-in-life obesity incorporating the dynamics of obesity duration in the
population across time. We will provide the first estimates of the role of slowdowns in the decline in cigarette
smoking use to CVD mortality trends by extending the Preston Glei Wilmoth approach to cause-specific
mortality. We will also apply g-method approaches to identify the joint effects of obesity and smoking
accounting for the dynamic relationship between the two variables. We will provide new estimates of the
changing prevalence, treatment, and control of three other established CVD risk factors (diabetes,
hypertension, high cholesterol) (Aim 1c). Aim 2 investigates “survival effects”, namely that improved survival
among those with a history of stroke or a heart attack have accumulated in the population raising the overall
frailty of the population. We will apply a novel simulation to quantify its role. Aim 3 turns the lens to disparities
and provides an in-depth accounting of heterogeneity in recent CVD trends by geography, race, nativity and
socioeconomic status. Examining subpopulation heterogeneity will reveal whether patterns of CVD mortality
align with those of diseases of despair. We will apply the methods developed in Aims 1 and 2 to account for
disparities in levels and trends in CVD mortality across population subgroups. We will also explicitly investigate
the role of the shifting population composition of the United States with respect to nativity and race/ethnicity.
 The stagnation in U.S. CVD mortality declines has now been evident for a decade without a clear
explanation. The COVID-19 pandemic may only worsen existing trends. Given the magnitude of the change in
the CVD mortality trajectory and the fact that it is now affecting Americans of most age groups indicates that
more than one causal factor is responsible. This project will be a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of
leading explanations for the stagnation."
10839331,"Exposure to food deprivation (e.g., hunger) and threat (violence) during mid-to-late adolescence (ages 15-19)
can have a lasting impact on the mental and physical health of youth. However, the interplay—during this key
developmental stage—of acute and chronic exposure to deprivation and threat with modifiable cognitive,
psychological, and social factors is not well understood. Clarifying this interplay would help guide the creation of
novel interventions that target specific, modifiable cognitive and social mechanisms during development. This is
crucial for impacting youth at elevated risk for mental health problems because of markedly dislocating and
stressful experiences, such as unaccompanied migration. Due to globalization, the number of unaccompanied
minors is increasing dramatically, including in the US where 194,000 arrived from Latin America in October 2020-
January 2022. Unaccompanied teen migrants are especially vulnerable to violence and hunger before, during,
and after migration. Prior studies in refugee teens show increased risk of PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety,
and substance use disorders. Post-resettlement stressors compound these risks. Threat and deprivation in early
adolescence predict poor mental health and worsened cognitive capacity, especially executive functions, which
continue to develop throughout adolescence. Importantly, not all youth who experience these adverse conditions
develop mental health problems; thus, it is essential to identify which risk factors are particularly important and
which coping strategies and community resources can buffer their effect. No study, to our knowledge, has
examined the impact of all these factors in one comprehensive model among unaccompanied migrant youth.
 In partnership with community organizations in New York City, our pilot study (CAMINANDO) recruited 74
teens who migrated from Latin America as unaccompanied minors. We found poorer mental health (PTSD,
generalized anxiety, depression) and executive functions were differentially associated with violence and hunger
exposure. Initial qualitative data further suggest that supportive social networks post-resettlement help youths
cope with the impact of migration. We propose CAMINANDO-Mental Health a parallel mixed-methods (QUANT-
qual) longitudinal study (18-month follow-up) of 400 migrant youth (ages 16-19) that builds on the infrastructure
of our pilot to: 1) examine the impact of exposure to threat and food deprivation (distinguishing acute from chronic
exposures) on the mental health status of teens who migrated to the US as unaccompanied minors, and 2)
assess how concurrent post-resettlement psychological (resilience, emotional well-being), cognitive (executive
functions), and social (daily stressors, supports) factors affect mental health trajectories over 18 months in late
adolescence. Our approach is innovative in that it: 1) includes concurrent potentially modifiable psychological,
cognitive, and social factors in one model; 2) accounts for both acute and chronic food deprivation and threat;
and 3) longitudinally examines the coping strategies and resource-use patterns of migrant teens in community
settings. Study findings will inform strategies to improve outcomes for teens migrating as unaccompanied minors."
10820436,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to determine the optimal time restricted eating (TRE) window to produce weight loss
in adults with overweight or obesity. Daily caloric restriction (DCR), the current standard of care dietary strategy
for weight loss, produces 5-7% weight loss in the context of a guidelines-based behavioral weight loss program,
yet adherence is challenging and weight regain is common. Thus, rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness
of novel dietary interventions is needed to provide a range of evidence-based options to effectively treat
obesity. TRE involves restriction of energy intake (EI) to a limited window of time each day and has been widely
promoted in the lay press, but TRE studies to date have shown only minimal (0-4%) weight loss. However, prior
TRE studies have several substantial limitations, including lack of standard of care DCR control groups, small
sample sizes, short duration, and failure to provide appropriate obesity treatment guidelines-based behavioral
support. While several different dietary strategies can be used to achieve energy restriction, behavioral support
is critical to enhancing adherence to both diet and physical activity (PA) recommendations and thus weight loss
outcomes, yet no prior studies have provided behavioral support for TRE. Further, most TRE studies to date
have utilized late TRE windows (L-TRE, e.g., eating window 12-8 PM), often providing the rationale that
participants are more likely to adhere to L-TRE rather than early TRE (E-TRE, e.g. eating window 8AM-4PM).
However, there is strong rationale from mechanistic studies to suggest E-TRE may result in greater weight loss
and cardiometabolic benefits than L-TRE. We have shown that E-TRE results in improvements in glucose
variability and insulin sensitivity, clinically significant weight loss (6.3 ± 4.1% at 12 weeks), as well as
improvements in dietary quality, increased PA, reduced sedentary time and subjective improvements in
sleep. However, we did not include a L-TRE control, so it is unclear whether the E-TRE window or the provision
of behavioral support enhanced weight loss outcomes as compared to prior TRE studies. Thus, a rigorously
designed trial is needed to evaluate the impact of E-TRE, L-TRE and DCR delivered in the context of a
guidelines-based behavioral intervention on weight loss and cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, 162 adults
with overweight or obesity will be randomized 1:1:1 to E-TRE (8-hr window starting 1-2 hrs after waking), L-TRE
(8-hr window starting 5-6 hrs after waking) or DCR (25% caloric restriction) for 26 weeks (primary outcome), with
follow up at 52 weeks. Our aims are to compare the effects of E-TRE, L-TRE, and DCR on: 1) Changes in body
weight and composition and markers of cardiometabolic health; 2) Dietary adherence, EI and dietary quality; and
3) PA and sleep. Our overall hypothesis is that E-TRE will result in greater weight loss and improvements in
cardiometabolic outcomes as compared to L-TRE and will be non-inferior to our current standard of care (DCR).
In addition, we hypothesize that adherence to E-TRE and L-TRE will be greater than adherence to DCR, and E-
TRE will result in greater adherence to PA and improved sleep duration/quality as compared to L-TRE and DCR."
10769735,"Abstract/Summary
Progress in understanding Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is close to producing more
effective treatments, creating an urgent need for disease-predictive biomarkers to guide their use. Using
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of beta-amyloid and Tau and positron-emission tomography tracers,
we can detect AD pathology in cognitively normal individuals. However, current tools do not allow us to predict
when or even if an individual with asymptomatic pathology will develop symptoms. To address this need, we
propose to longitudinally study ≥3000 cognitively normal individuals (50-75 years at enrollment) in the Emory
Healthy Brain Study to define the frequency of asymptomatic AD and rates of cognitive decline in a racially
diverse cohort of healthy individuals (Specific Aim 1). An important goal of Aim 1 is to achieve ≥33% African-
American participants to provide sufficient power to address questions regarding race- and sex-dependent
differences in biomarkers and risk of cognitive decline. Participants will be phenotyped biennially with cognitive
testing, cardiovascular physiology, brain MRI, and blood and CSF collection. Cross-sectional (Specific Aim 2)
and longitudinal analyses (Specific Aim 3) will test the hypothesis that biomarkers of synaptic, vascular,
myelination, glial immunity, and metabolic functions will identify subgroups who are at greatest risk of
progressing to symptomatic AD. Candidate biomarkers will be identified through state-of-the-art proteomics,
MR imaging, and statistical methods. A highly collaborative data and biospecimen sharing plan will allow other
investigators to leverage these resources to advance a broad spectrum of ADRD research."
10894601,"Project Summary – Core 2 – Clinical and Tissue Core CHU-Toulouse / DFCI
Modern biomedical research is being transformed by what is increasingly becoming a flood of information.
Electronic medical records have opened unprecedented opportunities for studies investigating a wide range of
problems ranging from epidemiological aspects of human disease to the comparative effectiveness of various
treatment protocols. Similarly, genomic technologies such as next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing from
bulk and single cell have opened a floodgate of data and information that promises to shed light on the complex
nature of human disease. In this information-rich age, one of the greatest challenges is therefore no longer
generating data, but effectively integrating it so that it can be used to our advantage. Because clinical practice
has long been separate from the research enterprise at most academic health centers, a situation has evolved
in which clinical and research data exist in separate, often incompatible domains with a variety of technical,
institutional, and organizational barriers between them. Further limiting our ability to extract the maximal value
of the data we have available is the fact that data within institutions is rarely integrated with the vast body of data
available in the public domain. Similarly, another need is to aid Investigators better characterize and identify
tumor biologic and molecular genetic correlates for response, progression, and survival by collecting, preserving
and distributing tissue derived from patients on clinical protocol. A large sources of clinical data will be used in
this program project. The data for this large IFM/DFCI collaborative clinical trials are collected in an established
clinical trials database at the IFM and DFCI. In the previous funding period this core has supported number of
clinical publications by providing database support and help projects generate large volume of genomics data
by providing quality-controlled tissue sample. This Core will continue to have as its main goals to create,
maintain, and quality control the clinical database (Specific Aim 1); and to collect, transport, process and store
tissue samples from all sites utilizing standardized procedures in centralized tissue banks (Specific Aim 2); and
to develop an integrated database to incorporate the sample tracking and oncogenomic information with the
relevant clinical data from the clinical trials database with web based query capabilities (Specific Aim 3)."
10763356,"ABSTRACT
Infections with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) during
pregnancy are associated with premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor and delivery, low birth weight,
congenital infections, perinatal death and mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection. Sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) like these are common in pregnant women globally, but often go undiagnosed; recent work by
our group found a 41% STI prevalence amongst HIV-infected pregnant women, of which 64% of infections were
asymptomatic. Recent research suggests the vaginal microbiome may play a critical role in STI acquisition,
persistence and treatment outcomes. Our pilot work has shown that diagnostic testing for CT, NG, and TV in
antenatal care services for HIV-infected pregnant women in South Africa is highly acceptable and feasible;
however, our work has made clear that evaluating the impact and cost effectiveness of different diagnostic
screening strategies that optimally decrease the burden of STIs during pregnancy and at time-of-delivery is
urgently needed. Furthermore, our findings highlight that biological factors that increase the risk for STI
persistence and/or treatment failures must be further investigated.
In response to the need to 1) identify optimal, cost-effective screening strategies that decrease the burden of
STIs during pregnancy and reduce adverse birth outcomes, 2) provide evidence to update WHO's syndromic
management guidelines, and 3) elucidate the role of the vaginal microbiome in STI treatment outcomes, we
propose a novel, highly innovative study with the following three Aims:
Aim 1: Evaluate 3 different screening strategies to decrease the burden of CT/NG/TV among pregnant
 women, and reduce adverse birth outcomes.
Aim 2: Evaluate cost per pregnant woman screened and treated, cost of adverse birth outcomes, and
 cost-effectiveness per STI and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.
Aim 3: Investigate the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and persistent Chlamydial
 infections in pregnant women.
Our proposed 5-year study will enroll 1250 HIV-infected and 1250 uninfected pregnant women from three large
ANC clinics in Tshwane District, South Africa, as well as their ~2500 neonates and up to 834 male partners. Our
research team, led by established researchers, has significant expertise and experience in all aspects of the
proposed study. Our multi-institutional collaborations will allow us to leverage unique implementation platforms
and resources, and allow for rapid dissemination of findings to South African and global stakeholders."
10782500,"Pericoronary fat: MACE risk from non-contrast CT and the role of iodine perfusion in contrast CT
Summary
Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) inflammation is an important, emerging concept in coronary artery dis-
ease, giving rise to the “outside-in” theory where inflammatory cells within PCAT, delivered by the vasa-
vasorum, influence atherosclerosis plaque progression. Using cardiovascular CT images, we will use ad-
vanced image processing and AI to better understand pericoronary fat appearance and to predict major ad-
verse cardiovascular events (MACE). As cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in
the US, improved early detection, disease prediction, and patient management will positively impact health for
many individuals. Using cardiac CT imaging (angiography, CCTA; perfusion, CCTP; and calcium score, CTCS)
in elegant experiments and analyses, we will elucidate pericoronary fat assessments and create a new, inex-
pensive CTCS assessment of pericoronary fat suitable for screening. As the principal pericoronary fat inflam-
mation feature in CCTA is elevated HU, we will use CCTP to assess pericoronary fat perfusion and clarify the
role of iodine on existing CCTA signatures, including confounds due to varying filling rates with obstructive dis-
ease. Using paired images, we will associate CTCS pericoronary fat features to established ones from CCTA.
Using appropriate pericoronary fat features from CTCS exams, we will predict major adverse cardiac events
(MACE) without the iodine confound and combine with Agatston to get an even better prediction. Large CTCS
cohorts enable interesting research studies. For example, using the serial Coronary Artery Risk Development
in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, we will determine if pericoronary fat features precede the appearance of cal-
cifications, giving credence to the “outside-in” theory. The CTCS exam is inexpensive (≤$99) at many institu-
tions. At University Hospitals (UH), our nationally acknowledged free CTCS program currently servicing
>13,000 patients/year with an archive of >65,000 cases, will provide an opportunity for big data, machine/deep
learning analysis of PCAT. In addition, improved MACE prediction from PCAT plus Agatston will enable multi-
ple future studies on health disparities, genes, cardiometabolic risk, co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes and psoria-
sis), and cardio-oncology. To accomplish goals, we have assembled a world class team of biomedical engi-
neers and physician scientists at University Hospitals/CWRU with deep knowledge of cardiovascular CT imag-
ing and the biology of atherosclerosis. This proposal will ultimately advance the field of predictive medicine and
propel new ways to pre-emptively detect at-risk patients so that they can be placed on evidence-based thera-
pies."

Most cancer patients that develop brain metastasis succumb to the disease. Brain metastasis occurs in patients
with melanoma (8-11%), lung (17-39%), and breast (5-17%) adenocarcinoma. Of all melanoma patients with
metastatic disease, 40-50% develop brain metastasis and this percentage raises to 70% in autopsy studies.
Despite its importance, mechanisms that mediate brain metastasis are largely unknown.
We developed a new BM model of patient-derived short-term cultures (STCs), which consist of a brain metastasis
(BM) and a non-brain metastasis (NBM)-derived STC from the same patient, and showed that matched pair BM
retain greater brain-specific metastatic capability than NBM STCs. Through proteomics and in vitro assays, we
showed that BM STCs have higher levels of APP-specific gamma secretase activity and secrete more Aβ than
their NBM counterparts. In xenograft models, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Aβ secretion dramatically
inhibited BM formation without affecting metastasis to other organs, exposing a critical role for Aβ in BM. We
hypothesize that therapeutic agents targeting Aβ, developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, can be repurposed
for the treatment of brain metastasis, as single agents or combined with approved therapies.
This proposal leverages the complementary expertise of Drs. Hernando (molecular mechanisms of melanoma
and metastasis), Schober (cell biology, single cell RNAseq), and Ruggles (computational biology) to: 1) assess
the therapeutic potential of clinical-grade antibodies and small molecules against Aβ in syngeneic preclinical
models of brain metastasis, 2) investigate if our findings apply to other tumor types with tropism to the brain, like
lung and breast adenocarcinoma, and brain tumors such as glioblastoma; and 3) investigate cell-autonomous
and non-cell autonomous effects of targeting Aβ on the brain microenvironment using single-cell resolution
techniques.
Our studies will detail if/how Aβ functions as a critical mediator of BM. Characterizing this novel mechanism will
provide important insights into BM, establish an intriguing link with neurodegeneration, and provide proof of
principle of Aβ inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy against BM and possibly brain tumors."

This project proposes empirical research and a scholarly book on the medicalization and pharmaceuti-
calization of food allergies. One out of every 13 US children has a food allergy, and nearly half of those
children are allergic to multiple foods. Because food allergies can be life-threatening, a significant amount
of biomedical research and development has been invested in finding effective therapies. These novel
therapeutic options—including one recent FDA-approved drug, an array of clinical trials, and even un-
regulated food-based treatments—have attracted considerable parental interest despite potentially sig-
nificant risks. Indeed, preliminary research indicates that parents often have a higher tolerance for the
risks of these medical treatments compared to the risks from food.
I am currently completing an ethnographic study of peanut allergy clinical trials, and the proposed project
will expand and continue this line of research for the scholarly book through three specific aims: (1) ex-
plore the experiences and perceptions of parents of children with peanut or other food allergies who have
not pursued clinical trials, (2) document how unregulated food allergy treatments are being offered
through private practices, and (3) integrate empirical findings from Aims 1 & 2 with my current ethno-
graphic work on food allergy clinical trial participation. For Aim 1, I will conduct 30 interviews with par-
ents who are (a) practicing avoidance of their children's food allergens with no additional treatment, (b)
treating their children's peanut allergy with the FDA-approved drug, or (c) treating their children's food
allergies with unregulated therapies. For Aim 2, I will conduct 10 interviews with clinicians who offer
unregulated food-based treatments for food allergies to analyze how they describe their practices, includ-
ing any safety protocols they have in place. The book manuscript will be written as part of Aim 3, wherein
I will use data from both projects to provide a comprehensive view of food allergy therapeutics.
The proposed project is significant because it will provide rich information about how US families navi-
gate food allergies as a part of everyday life as well as a condition that increasingly justifies risky thera-
peutic interventions. This project is innovative because food allergy therapeutics have not been examined
from a critical social science perspective, and there has been no empirical research comparing the per-
spectives of parents who choose different medical pathways to manage their children's food allergies or
comparing how stakeholders perceive potential differences between FDA-approved, investigational, and
unregulated food allergy treatments. Food allergies are certainly a health threat, but this new era of food
allergy therapeutics marks a transition in which the condition is being more intensely and problematically
medicalized."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia responsible for significant morbidity and mortality
burden. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder but disproportionately more common in
patients with AF. OSA has been proposed as a risk for AF. However, clarifying the association between the
OSA and AF has been challenging due to many commonly shared risk factors such as obesity. No studies
have demonstrated whether information about OSA improves prediction of future risk of AF. In particular,
identifying who “among those with OSA” would be at risk for AF is unclear. Better identification of the group
most vulnerable to developing AF among those with OSA will inform clinicians and patients of critical
information needed for therapeutic decision making. One major challenge in OSA evaluation is that
conventional metrics used in the evaluation, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) do not adequately
capture downstream cardiovascular (CV) responses. We and others have identified promising physiologically-
driven polysomnography (PSG) markers that better capture the severity of OSA and improve CV risk
stratification. Specifically related to AF, our preliminary study shows that heart rate response (HRR) to OSA
events, but not AHI, is associated with incident AF in community dwelling elderly men. Electrocardiography
(ECG) is a readily available diagnostic tool that captures electrical activity of the heart. Deep learning (DL) has
shown great promise in detection and risk prediction of various clinical outcomes including AF from `awake'
ECGs alone. `Sleep' ECG is affected by sleep state, respiration and particularly by pathological respiration
such as OSA events. Based on this, we propose Aim 1: To evaluate whether novel HRR-based OSA metrics
improves risk prediction of AF beyond the current AF risk prediction model. We will use a combined
prospective cohort of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC)-Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS),
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)-SHHS and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) (N~5000, AF
events~800). Aim 2: To develop and test the DL model using an awake ECG (10 sec 12 lead) and sleep ECG
(single lead) to predict a new onset AF in general population “with OSA”. We will develop a convolutional
neural network (CNN) model utilizing ARIC + CHS cohorts (combined N with OSA~1500, AF events ~400) and
externally validate in MESA cohort (OSA~1000, AF events ~100). The performance will be compared with the
CHARGE-AF risk prediction model. Aim 3: Same as Aim 2 except it will be the DL model in prediction of new
onset AF patients with OSA in clinical practice. Building upon the CNN model from Aim 2, we will develop a
separate CNN model using clinical ECG data from a single academic medical center (N= 2000, AF~200) that
may be more relevant in real world clinical practice. 50% of the dataset will be used for training and 50% for
validation. The findings of this study will provide critical information about the future application of DL in
improving CV risk stratification of people with OSA."

The objective of this proposal is to understand how immune responses in children with sickle
cell disease (cwSCD) are shaped by exposures in their local environment and lead to disparate
health outcomes. The rationale underlying this proposal is that our prior work demonstrates that
cwSCD have unique alterations in their blood inflammatory transcriptional profiles and upper
airway microbiomes at baseline with further perturbations during acute complications. We have
also shown that the public health exposome (PHE), which includes stressors from the natural,
built, social, and policy environments, influences inflammation in chronic diseases. The
proposed research is significant because SCD disproportionally impacts underrepresented
minority populations with many children frequently exposed to and challenged by multiple
negative social determinates of health. The central hypothesis is that the PHE is associated
with altered inflammatory signaling in cwSCD leading to increased frequency of acute
complications. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Characterize SCD baseline immune signatures and 2) Link environmental and socio-
demographic factors from the PHE 4.0 database to SCD outcomes at the individual, community,
and population-levels. We will pursue these aims using sophisticated transcriptional and
proteomic profiling of immune signatures combined with a novel database of real-time PHE data
and well-characterized clinical data. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in immunology,
microbiology, and public health along with hematology, pulmonology, and ID specialists
combines complementary clinical and research expertise to take a new approach to study
outcomes in cwSCD. The expected outcome of this work will establish a unique profile of
immune signatures integrated with the PHE to generate an unparalleled dataset of biologic
data with societal and environmental factors that influence health in cwSCD. The long-term
goal is to integrate findings with a comprehensive assessment of the airway and gut
microbiomes and hormonal stress responses from this cohort and longitudinally evaluate how
immune-environmental factors predict acute complications. Ultimately, we will create
comprehensive phenotypic profiles of cwSCD to help improve prediction, prevention, and
treatment of acute complications in cwSCD that move beyond the current paradigm of
supportive and/or reactive care."

duration of sleep. Disruptions in sleep that come with aging may result in effects such as fatigue,
irritability, headaches, and deteriorating cognition. These disruptions are presumed to result from
alterations in brain regions that underlie endocrine, behavioral and cognitive responses to
homeostatic challenges in the organism. Unraveling common molecular mechanisms between
aging and sleep disturbances – which may lead to new therapeutic strategies to alleviate these
outcomes – is of great importance. Aging pathophysiology points to dysfunctional cholinergic
transmission, which may be driven, in part, by altered hypothalamic orexin neurons. We
hypothesize that kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of cholinergic
neurotransmission, plays a mechanistic role in age-related sleep dysfunction and orexin
activation. The small molecule KYNA is of particular interest because (i) KYNA and its
synthesizing enzymes kynurenine aminotranferases (KATs) are increased in the aging brain and
(ii) an excess of KYNA may be especially involved in sleep deficits that are seen with advanced
age. We propose the novel hypothesis that accumulated KYNA activates orexin neurons, thereby
disrupting sleep, a circumstance that is exacerbated with aging or a homeostatic sleep deprivation
(SD) challenge wherein KYNA accumulates in the brain. A specific inhibitor of KAT II, main
enzyme responsible for brain KYNA formation, will be used as an experimental tool to
mechanistically test the hypothesis. There are two specific aims to test our hypothesis. Aim #1:
To examine the relationship of KYNA to orexinergic activation in the lateral hypothalamus of
young rats (3-4 months) and old rats (26-28 months). Hypothesis: Accumulation of KYNA, as a
result of aging or acute sleep deprivation (SD), in the lateral hypothalamus activates orexin
neurons. Aim #2: To evaluate the impact of KYNA synthesis inhibition in improving sleep quality
in old rats and young rats with reduced orexin expression. Hypothesis: KAT II inhibition serves as
an efficacious strategy to overcome sleep architecture deficits in old rats and young rats with
reduced orexinergic signaling."

This R03 proposal describes a two-year research plan focused on the investigation of previously unannotated
miniproteins to the genetic etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Rare inherited and de novo genetic
variants are important causes of ASD, but explain the etiology in only ~20% of families. Furthermore, rare
ASD-associated variants have been identified in noncoding regions of the genome, but the functional
significance of those found is largely unknown, representing a critical knowledge gap in ASD genetics. We
recently completed a study to profile the mRNA translational landscape (the “translatome”) of the human brain,
identifying thousands of small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding putative miniproteins <100 amino acids,
many of which are translated from annotated noncoding regions of the genome. We hypothesize that
miniproteins represent an unappreciated cache of hidden genes whose role in disease is almost entirely
unexplored. To address the potential role of miniproteins in ASD, we will leverage the largest whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) dataset in ASD, as well as our newly created atlas of human brain miniproteins, to discover
miniprotein genes associated with ASD risk based on rare inherited and de novo sequence-level and structural
variants (Aim 1). Additionally, our preliminary data suggest that many miniproteins lack three-dimensional
structure (intrinsically disordered) and are rich in sequence motifs that bind RNA. Traditional sequence-based
analysis of proteins will perform poorly on short, highly disordered miniproteins. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will
build physical feature-based analysis paradigms to predict the molecular function of ASD-associated
miniproteins. This work combines expertise in developmental neuroscience, genomics, and computational
protein biology. The knowledge gained from this R03, including the identification of new ASD-associated
genes, will form the basis of future studies to characterize the function, cell type-specificity, and developmental
regulation of miniproteins in the human brain, as well as their contribution to ASD. Our approach to
incorporating previously unannotated miniproteins in genetic analysis can be applied to other neurologic and
non-neurologic conditions, thereby expanding our understanding of the genetic architecture of human disease."

Advances in synthetic biology have accelerated to the point where the synthesis of entire genomes is now
possible. However, the technologies for these feats are painstaking, and the production of a new chromosome
or genome requires multiple years of effort, working from small fragments to ever larger assemblies. The
cumbersome assembly process is due in large measure to the need to carry out an ordered series of hierarchical
homologous recombination steps that proceed through transformations into organisms, primarily yeast. The
speed (and ultimately scale) of large fragment assembly would be greatly improved if it were possible to routinely
amplify very long stretches of DNA (> 100 kb) in vitro. To that end, this proposal is focused on the further
development of a novel directed evolution method known as Compartmentalized Self-Replication (CSR), in
which polymerases expressed in cells in emulsions undergo thermal cycling to amplify their own genes, to
generate long read DNA polymerases that should prove capable of generating PCR amplicons > 100 kb in length,
with few errors. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop a novel library construction method that most
efficiently brings together sequence and structural domains from a variety of DNA polymerase variants to form
diverse chimeras (Aim 1.1), and to sieve these libraries using improvements to CSR that will allow us to select
for extreme processivity in yeast (Aim 1.2) and efficient error-correction (Aim 1.3). The variants that result will
be characterized for their ability to synthesize long amplicons in vitro (Aim 2.1), for their fidelity (Aim 2.2), and
for their detailed kinetic properties (Aim 2.3). Finally, to better ensure the processivity of the resultant polymerase
chimeras, we will append either DNA-binding domains (Aim 3.1) or clamps (Aim 3.2) that should lead to much
better ability to grip DNA. In addition to accelerating the ongoing revolution in genome synthesis, such long-read
polymerases should also pave the way to new sequencing technologies, including for single molecule
sequencing and for single cell sequencing."

Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully carried out, identifying numerous
genetic variants associated with common diseases and disease related complex traits. The identified genetic
associations can now explain a large fraction of the genetic contribution and trait heritability, revealing the
genetic architecture underlying common diseases. The success of GWAS in the past few years have laid down
a solid foundation both for pursuing the mechanistic insights towards the biology of disease and for
transitioning towards new diagnostics and therapeutics in clinical settings. Advancing GWAS towards
mechanistic insights and clinical translations, however, urgently requires the development of advanced
computational methods that can take advantage of the unique data features and increased data complexity of
GWAS as well as the data available from parallel genomics studies.
 Here, we propose to develop a set of new computational methods to advance GWAS analytics beyond
simple variant association analysis and move towards the understanding of the biology of disease and enable
potential clinical translations. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop integrative methods to integrate GWAS
with multiple gene expression mapping studies of distinct genetic ancestries to investigate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the variant-trait associations and interrogate the contribution of ancestry specific
genetic architecture underlying expression towards gene-trait associations. In Aim 2, we will develop causal
inference methods to leverage the genetic associations to improve our understanding of the causal relationship
among complex traits and to identify causal risk factors that underlie disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will develop
prediction methods to make use of the genetic associations and take advantage of the genetic and
environmental correlation among multiple complex traits to facilitate the genetic prediction of disease risk,
aiding disease diagnosis and clinical applications. All methods will be implemented in user-friendly open-
source software and disseminated to the scientific community. At its conclusion, the proposed study will
provide a comprehensive suite of computational methods and software tools for advanced analytics in GWAS.
These methods are essential for understanding the transcriptomic and causal mechanism underlying disease
etiology, enabling accurate and robust genetic prediction of disease risks, and facilitating biological discoveries

OpenMM [http://openmm.org] is the most widely-used open source GPU-accelerated framework for biomolecular
modeling and simulation (>1300 citations, >270,000 downloads, >1M deployed instances). Its Python API makes
it widely popular as both an application (for modelers) and a library (for developers), while its C/C++/Fortran
bindings enable major legacy simulation packages to use OpenMM to provide high performance on modern
hardware. OpenMM has been used for probing biological questions that leverage the $14B global investment in
structural data from the PDB at multiple scales, from detailed studies of single disease proteins to superfamily-wide
modeling studies and large-scale drug development efforts in industry and academia.
Originally developed with NIH funding by the Pande lab at Stanford, we aim to fully transition toward a community
governance and sustainable development model and extend its capabilities to ensure OpenMM can power the
next decade of biomolecular research. To fully exploit the revolution in QM-level accuracy with machine-learning
(ML) potentials, we will add plug-in support for ML models augmented by GPU-accelerated kernels, enabling
transformative science with QM-level accuracy. To enable high-productivity development of new ML models with
training dataset sizes approaching 100 million molecules, we will develop a Python framework to enable OpenMM
to be easily used within modern ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Together with continued
optimizations to exploit inexpensive GPUs, these advances will power a transformation within biomolecular

10580080,"Scientific advances from pain research in basic models and chronic pain populations are rarely translated and
applied to improve our clinical understanding of pain and disability among individuals with significant
intellectual, motor, and communicative impairments associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite
the well document burden of chronic pain in cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of pediatric-onset
lifelong motor and developmental disability, there is relatively little known about sensory function in relation to
chronic pain. The heterogeneity in CP etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical appearance suggests new
approaches may be warranted to identify measureable phenotypic patient characteristics predictive of
individual variation in chronic pain outcomes. Current pain assessment approaches used in CP are limited in
their ability to subgroup CP patients in relation to sensory function that may be relevant for understanding
pathophysiological pain mechanisms. Most of the sensory testing research conducted with CP, while important
and not in question, has relied on sensory stimuli designed to assess impaired discriminative tactile abilities
such as two-point discrimination, texture and shape perception reflecting large sensory fiber afferent function.
There has been little work incorporating sensory testing approaches that simultaneously evaluate loss and gain
of sensory function reflecting both large and small fiber afferent integrity. The specific purpose of this
application is to address the limited scientific understanding of sensory function in CP to ultimately reduce the
burden of chronic pain. As a first step to close the gap between the well documented pain burden in CP and
the relatively unexplored pain mechanisms in CP we are proposing to investigate an objective standardized
(protocol-based) measurement approach by extending the application of a modified quantitative sensory
testing (QST) protocol to characterize and compare sensory function in children with CP with and without
chronic pain. Our reasoning is as follows. First, comparing sensory function between chronic pain and no
chronic pain groups has the potential to reveal differences in underlying tactile/nociceptive sensory function
with high relevance for improving our understanding of chronic pain in CP and other severe IDD populations.
Second, applying QST to a large sample of children and adolescents with CP will provide the basis for
investigating sensory function in relation to individual and clinical characteristics, and health outcomes to
identify novel tailoring variables that could guide pain treatment target selection (no such guidelines exist right
now). Third, using a protocol-based approach affords an important standardized context in which to investigate
nociceptive and inflammatory relevant biomarkers. Finally, the logic of QST provides the basis for exploratory
but highly novel tests of sensory subtype constructs (gain, loss of function) informed by the chronic/neuropathic
pain research literature as a first step toward creating sensory-function based grouping of chronic pain in CP."

HIV incidence is declining in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but some areas are not on track to achieve the
“epidemic control” target of <0.1% annual rate of new infections set by the United Nations in the Sustainable
Development Goals. Common mental disorders (CMD) such as depression and anxiety are extremely
prevalent among people living with HIV, interfere with lifelong adherence to treatment, and are associated with
risky sexual behaviors. Accordingly, health authorities in SSA are recognizing the importance of CMD
screening and treatment as a component of HIV prevention, but have not yet determined where to focus these
services. The areas at greatest risk of missing the epidemic control target are known as HIV hotspots. We
hypothesize that there are different types of hotspots: some driven by risky behaviors, some arising by random
chance, and some that emerged in the past and have become trapped in a positive feedback loop between
incidence and prevalence. The optimal role of CMD screening and treatment may differ by hotspot type.
We propose to use mathematical modeling to predict the occurrence of hotspots, determine how to classify
them by type, and estimate the optimal role of CMD screening and treatment for each HIV hotspot type. Next,
we will work with experts in two SSA countries – Kenya and Zambia – to develop an investment case for
incorporating CMD screening and treatment into an optimal HIV response, either nationally or with a focus on
HIV hotspots. Finally, we will use a value-of-information approach to determine whether the costs of finding
and classifying hotspots are justified by the benefits of targeting and customizing the HIV response to each
hotspot. We expect our project to guide Ministries of Health and implementers about scale-up of CMD
treatment in SSA while also expanding basic understanding of HIV epidemics, which were hypothesized to
contain hotspots due to fundamental mathematical properties such as fractals and chaos. These hypotheses
have not been revisited in two decades, while geospatial HIV data and methods have proliferated. We expect
that our project will enable more effective HIV prevention in SSA by expanding hotspot targeting and by
facilitating the integration of CMD care into the HIV response."

Cxcl10 is a chemokine that mediates leukocyte migration during normal immune response. In cancers, Cxcl10
has been considered as a good prognostic marker correlated with tumor immune infiltrates and therapy
response, consistent with its normal function in cytotoxic immune response. As such, Cxcl10 has been utilized
as an indicator of robust immune response to therapy in clinical trials and Cxcl10-based cancer therapy has
been proposed. Paradoxically, Cxcl10 is associated with metastasis and poor patient survival in several
cancers including breast cancer, suggesting that Cxcl10 may have a function of promoting cancer progression.
The molecular context of this Cxcl10 oncogenic role is not well understood. This research team has identified
CXCL10 as one of the inflammatory genes repressed by the ING4 tumor suppressor, which suggested a
potential inverse functional relationship. Preliminary studies from the PI’s laboratory analyzed breast tumor
gene expression datasets including METABRIC and found that CXCL10-high/ING4-low expression was
significantly associated with reduced disease-free survival in patients. These data suggested that Cxcl10 may
exert an oncogenic effect in the context of ING4 deficiencies. Corroborating this, Cxcl10 induced in vitro
migration of ING4-deleted cells, but not of ING4-intact cells. The use of inhibitors demonstrated that Cxcl10-
induced cell migration required Cxcr3 (the receptor for Cxcl10) and the Gbg subunits downstream of Cxcr3 G
protein-coupled protein receptor (GPCR), but not Gai. These data indicated a novel mechanism of the
Cxcl10/Cxcr3/Gbg axis that mediated migration of ING4-deleted cells and potentially metastasis. Based on
these data, the hypothesis that Cxcl10/Cxcr3/Gbg signaling mediates metastasis of ING4-deficient cancer
was generated. The overall goal of the study is to unravel the mechanism of Cxcl10 oncogenic signaling. To
test the hypothesis for this Small Grants Program R03 proposal, the specific aims will focus on Gbg signaling
as it may present novel therapeutic opportunities. The specific aims are: 1) to identify the specific Gbg
subunits responsible for mediating Cxcl10-induced migration of ING4-deleted breast cancer cells in vitro and 2)
to determine the role of Gbg in Cxcl10-induced metastasis of mammary tumors using mouse models. In mouse
models, gallein (a Gbg inhibitor) and Gb/Gg gene deletion will be evaluated for inhibitory effects on Cxcl10-
induced tumor metastasis. Impact: Up to 34% of breast cancers have been identified as ING4-deficient, which is
correlated with lymph node positivity and poor patient survival. Thus, delineation of the Cxcl10/Cxcr3/Gbg/ING4
signaling mechanism may have a broad impact on breast cancer treatment. If the proposed hypothesis is proven
correct, the cell and mouse models in the study can further be used to test novel therapeutic agents targeting the
pathway."

The long-term objective of this project is to characterize the pathways and mechanisms that preserve viability
and genome integrity in adult mammals exposed to environmental genotoxic stresses. DNA damage can be
repaired by the high fidelity pathway homology directed repair (HDR) or by error prone non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ). The consequences of HDR loss in adult vertebrates is not well understood because germline
knockouts are embryonic lethal, thus, most of our understanding has come from cell culture models or inferred
from tumors caused by HDR deficiency.
To address this critical need, we have generated genetically engineered mice that can undergo inducible deletion
of up to 99% of the essential HDR gene Brca1 in every tissue, post development. We will use this model to
address critical questions on 1) the role of HDR in cell/tissue/organismal viability after different types of DNA
damage; 2) the dependence of different tissues on HDR to maintain genome integrity after different types of DNA
damage; 3) mutation signatures in tissues of HDR deficient mice caused by different stresses, allowing inference
of repair pathway utilized in absence of HDR; 4) how the transcription factor p53 cooperates with HDR in each
of these phenotypes; 5) the cooperative role of HDR and NHEJ in DNA repair. We hypothesize that in mice with
deletion of the essential HDR gene Brca1, tissues known to develop HDR deficient tumors will have a higher
mutation rate and favor p53 mediated programs of arrest over apoptosis compared to non-tumor prone tissues.
Specific Aim 1. Determine how HDR preserves viability by mediating tissue specific cellular and
transcriptional responses. In wild type or Brca1 deleted mice, we will examine how Brca1/HDR preserves
near-term viability after different types of DNA damage by 3 measures: 1) the DNA damage response and cell
fate (apoptosis, cell cycle arrest); 2) transcriptomic changes; 3) pathology of different tissues.
Specific Aim 2. Determine tissue and DNA damage-specific role of Brca1/HDR in maintaining genome
integrity. In this aim, we will examine long-term consequences of HDR deficiency on genome maintenance.
Somatic mutations are known to accumulate in normal human tissues with age and are linked to disease. We
will examine fidelity of repair and longevity of mice with or without functional HDR that survive different types of
DNA damage. Deep sequencing and mutation signature analysis will reveal what tissues rely on HDR and what
type of DNA perturbation is most mutagenic in different HDR deficient tissues.
Specific Aim 3. Determine viability and stress response in mice deficient in NHEJ or both NHEJ and HDR.
Because embryonic deletion of either Brca1 or the NHEJ gene Lig4 (coding for Ligase 4) is lethal, their individual
and cooperative roles in adult tissues are not known. In this aim, we will examine survival and stress response
after deletion of both HDR and NHEJ pathways in adult mice, leaving only SSA and alt-NHEJ."

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common cancer diagnosed in lifetime smokers of whom there are
more than 90 million in the United States. Smokers with LUAD frequently (more than 25%) harbor somatic
activating mutations in the Kras oncogene. Kras-mutant LUAD (KM-LUAD) displays very poor clinical outcome
and inferior response to therapy. Despite the urgent need of new strategies for early treatment of this fatal
disease, we still do not understand targetable changes that promote onset of KM-LUAD. Using a human-
relevant genetically engineered mouse model comprised of tobacco exposure and high somatic mutation
burdens including driver Kras variants, features that constitute a perfect storm for LUAD pathogenesis in
humans, we identified significant progressive changes in gut microbiome composition that were coexistent with
reduced levels of gut and circulating bacterial metabolites and closely associated with evolution of KM-LUAD.
Similar microbial phenotypes were observed in mice exposed to combustible cigarette smoke (CCS). We
further found in lungs of the mice up-regulation of pro-tumor inflammatory cues including activation of the IL-6
/STAT3 pathway which we have previously shown to promote KM-LUAD development by immune
reprogramming. Also, we noted that lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a host defense antimicrobial protein that is released
from cells during microbiome imbalance, was markedly progressively up-regulated in normal airway cells prior
to onset of Kras-mutant preneoplasias and LUADs. Genetic deletion of Lcn2 in these mice markedly increased
KM-LUAD development concomitant with global changes in the gut microbiome and heightened pro-tumor lung
inflammation. Despite these insights, the interplay between the host microbiome and key immune responses in
the pathogenesis of KM-LUAD are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the host microbiome (derived
from the gut and possibly the lung) promotes tobacco-associated KM-LUAD development through
activation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway and changes in systemic and lung immune contexture. We will
address our hypothesis using the following three aims. In Aim 1, using sequencing, metagenomics, as well as
bacterial metabolite and immune profiling approaches, we will discern evolving microbiome changes that are
functionally linked to tobacco carcinogen- and CCS-associated KM-LUAD development as well as probe
downstream systemic and local (in lung) immunomodulatory effects including those on the pro-tumor IL-
6/STAT3 pathway. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of host antimicrobial and immunomodulatory cues
mediated by LCN2 induction in KM-LUAD pathogenesis. In Aim 3, we will investigate chemopreventive and
early therapeutic effects of microbiome intervention, alone or in combination with immunotherapy, against KM-
LUAD. At the conclusion of our studies, we will have shed light on uncharted host processes in the evolution of
KM-LUAD, paved the way for identification of new targets to guide chemoprevention and early detection of this
fatal disease in smokers and contributed novel models for studying LUAD pathogenesis."

exon 25 leading to a G1336R change in epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat 34 presented with skeletal
fragility and fractures. Never before has a mutation in Notch signaling been associated with osteogenesis
imperfecta (OI). Whereas significant knowledge has been generated about the function of Notch receptors in
the skeleton, little is known regarding mechanisms that control the activation of Notch and that are dependent
on the interaction of its extracellular domain with Notch ligands. We created a Notch24006G>C mouse model
(Notch2em1Ecan) that harbors a 4006G>C mutation in exon 25 of Notch2 and exhibits small and fragile bones
replicating the genetic and functional outcomes of the human disorder. This reveals that a previously
unrecognized mutation in the extracellular domain of NOTCH2 causes a skeletal syndrome; however, the
mechanisms responsible for the skeletal manifestations are not established, and will be explored as part of the
proposed research. Our specific aims are: Aim 1) To characterize the skeletal phenotype of Notch2em1Ecan
mutants. Our goals are to establish the phenotype and cell lineage affected in Notch2 mutant mice and
mechanisms responsible for the skeletal phenotype; Aim 2) To establish the mechanisms responsible for
changes in Notch24006G>C mutant function. We will determine whether NOTCH2 mutants have altered affinity
and binding to Notch ligands of the Jagged and Delta-like families and whether this results in changes in Notch
activation and signaling in Notch2em1Ecan mutants. The goals of the proposed work are to understand novel
functions of the NOTCH2 extracellular domain and the skeletal manifestations of diseases associated with a
newly discovered NOTCH2 mutation."

important enzymes involved in multielectron oxidation or reduction reactions employ metal
clusters in their catalysis. The Britt laboratory is studying how such clusters are assembled by
identifying and interrogating assembly intermediates with their spectroscopic methods. For
example, the [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase enzyme uses a complex multinuclear Fe-S “H-cluster”,

of H2 with protons and electrons. How does nature safely assemble such a center involving
potentially dangerous CO and CN- species? Other experiments are unraveling the biosynthesis
of the complex Fe-S “M-cluster” at the heart of the nitrogenase enzyme, which can incorporate
Mo or V or an additional Fe in its active site. We are studying the biosynthesis of an interesting

cells. Comparative transcriptomics coupled with functional perturbation revealed a premigratory “cranial-specific”
neural crest GRN subcircuit that links anterior identity to ability to differentiate into facial cartilage. Here, we
propose to elucidate the gene regulatory network (GRN) downstream of this cranial-specific subcircuit
that confers ability to differentiate into facial skeleton. The goal is to understand the program underlying
differentiation and pattern formation of craniofacial cartilage. First, we will explore regulatory changes in trunk
neural crest cells after introduction of cranial crest subcircuit genes. Next, we will characterize late-migrating
cranial crest cells as they condense to form facial cartilage at the single cell level to understand GRN changes
as a function of time, at single cell resolution and a functional level. Finally, we propose to identify active
enhancers and their direct inputs in late migrating and condensing cranial crest cells by combining in vivo
electroporation of reporter constructs in the chick embryo with high throughput genomic approaches. To these
ends, we will conduct the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Effects of “reprogramming” trunk neural crest cell identity. Ectopic expression of cranial
 crest subcircuit genes imbues trunk crest cells with chondrogenic potential after grafting to the head. Here we
 will: characterize transcriptional changes that occur in reprogrammed trunk crest cells over time; test the ability
 of reprogrammed trunk neural crest to form ectopic cartilage in their normal environment; test the ability of the
 cranial subcircuit to confer chondrogenic ability onto ES cells and crestosphere-derived cells.
Specific Aim 2: Transcriptional profiling and functional validation of condensing cranial neural crest
 cells at high cell resolution using single cell RNA-seq and multiplex in situ hybridization. To gain
 insights into how neural crest-derived cells differentiate and what gene regulatory programs control their
 progression to facial skeleton, we propose to perform single cell RNA-seq of condensing cranial crest cells in
 the branchial arches with the goal of identifying candidate GRN components of the cartilage-forming module.
 We will validate expression of candidate transcription factors at high resolution and test their function using
 CRISPR-Cas9 knockout.
Specific Aim 3: Construction of a cranial cartilage gene regulatory network (GRN) by identifying cis-
 regulatory elements and direct downstream targets of the cranial crest-specific subcircuit genes. In
 order to build regulatory linkages in branchial arch neural crest, we will characterize their chromatin landscape
 using low-input Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) optimized for as few as 1500 cells
 per replicate and perform CUT&RUN to confirm direct inputs downstream of subcircuit genes."

The recent FDA approval of 7T for clinical imaging of the knee, opens the possibility that this ultrahigh field
MRI platform will become a more prominent tool in biomedical research and patient management.
Musculoskeletal (MSK) research and diagnostic imaging have been traditionally performed at magnetic
fields of 1.5 and 3T. While there is increasing availability of ultrahigh field (UHF) 7T instruments and FDA
approval of 7T clinical use in the head and knee, only a fraction of the system’s true capability is being
exploited. First, approval has only been given for operation in a single transmit mode configuration. As
such, clinicians cannot take advantage of the available parallel transmit (pTx) functionality to integrate
state-of-the-art solutions for tackling B1+ homogeneity and local SAR management. Even if available, the
RF coils and optimization routines to use the pTx functionality do not exist. Second, traditional diagnostic
imaging methods for evaluating the knee do not fully exploit the array of morphologic, compositional, and
functional data available when performing MRI at UHF. Both the traditional and novel imaging approaches
alike benefit from the increased signal-to-noise ratio at 7T. The increased sensitivity can be exploited to
provide higher resolution images that are known to have a real and significant impact on diagnostic
accuracy in the knee. Furthermore, certain methods are simply too compromised at lower field strengths
to be obtained as part of routine imaging at 3T and below including techniques like quantitative sodium
imaging and perfusion as measured through arterial spin labeling. In this proposal we focus on the
engineering, methodological and protocol developments to realize the full potential of 7T knee imaging
and provide a critical translational study focusing on the utility of the methods to impact clinical care. This
work will be accomplished by completing four specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on the development,
integration, and optimization of a pTx RF coil coil using ultrahigh dielectric constant (uHDC) material and
RF management strategies to provide high-resolution morphological knee imaging methods including zero
echo time imaging. Aim 2 will implement and optimizequantitative compositional and functional methods for
evaluating the knee joint at 7T including T1rho andarterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion methods. Aim 3
will involve the development and optimization of a sodium (23Na) knee coil using uHDC material and
strategies for accurate quantification of 23Na concentration in the articular cartilage of the knee. Finally,
the translational Aim 4, will involve a pilot study to explore the ability of the developed technologies and
methods to impact patientcare. The technical developments in this proposal will advance knee imaging at
7T and likely accelerate its clinical adoption. The results of the pilot study are expected to have an immediate
and important impact,by forming the basis of future longitudinal prospective studies evaluating the effects
of medical treatmentson clinical outcome."
10747345,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nonsense mutations cause approximately 15% of genetically inherited retinopathies and inherited human
diseases in general, accounting for 2.5 to 3 million patients in the U.S. For certain specific genes, nonsense
mutation incidences can be as high as 40%. Because nonsense mutations cause premature termination (PTC)
of protein translation, the disease phenotype is often severe. Currently, there are only a limited number of
therapies for nonsense mutations being tested in human clinical trials, including gene therapy, small molecule
read-through drugs, or genome editing. Associated challenges equal the promises of each of these therapeutic
options. Looking forward, newer technologies may address these hurdles and provide more safe and efficacious
treatments for patients. During protein translation, tRNA functions at the ribosomal site to incorporate a specific
amino acid into the polypeptide sequence. We aim to develop the next generation of nucleic acid therapy based
on anticodon encoding transfer RNA (ace-tRNA) that incorporates the correct wild type amino acid at the site of
a disease-causing nonsense mutation. Because of the many anatomical advantages afforded by the eye, we
seek to test the broad applicability of ace-tRNA therapeutics for nonsense mutations that cause retinopathies
and related blindness due to defects in a variety of genes, including those encoding ion channel proteins.
Specifically we will focus on nonsense mutation in ion channels expressed in photoreceptors (PR) which convert
retinal light inputs and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which provide support for PR. These two cell types are
primarily the site of blindness pathogenesis.
In this project, we will:
 1) Develop ace-tRNA therapeutics that target specific nonsense mutations across several PR and RPE ion
channels.
 2) Engineer both viral and non-viral ace-tRNA delivery systems for long-term editing. Using these we will
 determine the functional outcome of ace-tRNA treatment using cultured cells and human iPSC-derived
 RPE and iPSC-PR retinal organoids.
 3) Test both our viral and non-viral ace-tRNA in vivo using mice harboring genetic defects that cause
 blindness in humans; and
 4) Assess the safety and bioavailability of ace-tRNA therapeutics in our preclinical NHP model systems.
There are no FDA-approved therapeutic drugs that target channelopathies because of the complexities
associated with precise post-translational modifications, carefully regulated expression, and assembly. Our
team’s combined expertise in ace-tRNA development, nanomaterial synthesis, human pluripotent stem cell
biology, ion-channel physiology, and pathophysiological model systems is unique and ideally suited to advance
ace-tRNA technology toward clinical trials for a wide range of genetic diseases that cause blindness."
10766119,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Binaural hearing provides substantial benefits in complex listening environments, improving the ability to
understand speech and providing the ability to localize sounds. However, in order to take advantage of binaural
cues, sounds from the two ears need to be integrated (binaural integration). Binaural integration does not
fully occur for some populations of listeners, such as cochlear implant (CI) users. Whether, and the degree to
which, binaural integration occurs depends on two aspects of the acoustic signal. One aspect is the statistical
similarity between the waveforms in the left and right ear (interaural correlation). The second is the symmetry
in terms of the place of stimulation in the two ears (physical interaural symmetry). Our overarching
hypothesis is that interaural correlation and interaural symmetry both play a role in binaural integration, with
interaural correlation also driving adaptation, altering the functional interaural asymmetry to counter the effects
of the physical interaural symmetry.
The proposed study will manipulate the interaural correlation and interaural symmetry of the signal as well as
the cochlear region to which the signals are delivered. These experiments will provide insight into both the
functioning of the auditory system and the critical factors to consider when developing device programming
techniques for bilateral CI users (Specific Aim 1). While adaptation, reducing the effects of physical interaural
asymmetry, has been well documented for pitch-matching tasks, we hypothesize that interaurally correlated
signals drive adaptation across the entire binaural auditory system, but the magnitude and/or time-course of
the effects differ across different binaural cues. These experiments will provide critical insight into the relative
importance of interaurally correlated and physically interaurally symmetric signals for driving adaptation. They
will also provide critical guidance as to when it is crucial to address the common issue that bilateral CI users
chronically receive interaurally correlated signals at interaurally asymmetric locations (Specific Aim 2).
The proposed studies will provide fundamental insight in to how the binaural auditory system combines signals
from the two ears. This research will also provide insight into the factors that will influence bilateral CI users’
binaural abilities, both directly after activation, and over time. This will lay the groundwork for a paradigm shift
in terms of how and when clinicians program bilateral CI users’ devices to maximize binaural benefits."
10783725,"Project Summary: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) can cure hematological
malignancies, but this treatment causes graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an immune response of donor cells
against the recipient. Anti-inflammatory corticosteroid medications can often control GVHD, but in some cases,
GVHD is resistant to this treatment, especially when it affects the intestinal tract. The goal of this project is to
understand the mechanisms that cause steroid-resistant (SR) gut GVHD and to develop effective approaches to
prevent or treat SR-Gut-GVHD. Results with a newly established murine model have demonstrated that SR-Gut-
GVHD is induced by prolonged administration of corticosteroids. Corticosteroid treatment induces expansion of
IL-22-producing Th/Tc22-like cells, IL-22-dependent abnormalities in gut microorganisms, and reduced numbers
of anti-inflammatory CX3CR1hi mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) that regulate T cell expansion and control
bacterial translocation. Information from our preliminary studies and other investigators suggests that
corticosteroid treatment inhibits the polyamine-hypusine pathway in T and MNP cells and regulates the fidelity
of T cell lineage differentiation and the expansion of pro- and anti-inflammatory MNP cells. Our studies also
suggest that steroid treatment increases Ceacam-1 expression by intestinal epithelial cells, thereby increasing
bacterial transcytosis and unfavorably altering the balance between proinflammatory CX3CR1lo MNP and anti-
inflammatory CX3CR1hi MNP cells. These changes trigger a feedforward pathogenic loop consisting of
expanding IL-22-producing Th/Tc22-like cells, IL-22-dependent dysbiosis, and increased numbers of
proinflammatory CX3CR1lo MNP with decreased numbers of regulatory CX3CR1hi MNP, leading to full-blown
SR-Gut-GVHD. To test this hypothesis, this application proposes 3 aims. Aim 1 will determine whether
corticosteroid inhibition of the polyamine-hypusine pathway in T cells leads to expansion of Th/Tc22-like cells
with lineage infidelity. Aim 2 will determine whether corticosteroid inhibition of polyamine-hypusine pathway in
CX3CR1+ MNP cells augment expansion of proinflammatory CX3CR1lo MNP with reduced numbers of anti-
inflammatory CX3CR1hi MNP in response to challenge by dysbiosis. Aim 3 will determine whether observations
in murine models reflect the pathogenesis of SR-Gut-GVHD in humans and whether reversal of abnormalities in
the polyamine-hypusine pathway and whether blocking bacterial interaction with Ceacam-1 on intestinal
epithelial cells by anti-Ceacam-1 mAb prevents and reverses SR-Gut-GVHD.
Relevance: By elucidating in-depth mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis leading to SR-Gut-GVHD in
a well characterized murine model and by assessing the relevance of the experimental results in colon tissue
from patients with SR-Gut-GVHD, results of this project could identify potentially effective approaches for
translational testing in humans."
10812228,"Project Summary/Abstract
The identification of cancer metastases to the bony vertebral column obligates the treating clinician to make a
surgical decision. Current spinal stability decision-making is empirical, qualitative, and can be inaccurate. The
consequences of that decision for the patient, however, are significant. If the spine is deemed at risk for
fracture, then the patient will undergo a major spinal operation. Conversely, the patient whose spine is deemed
stable risks fracture and possible paralysis if the analysis was incorrect. This research program addresses both
the stability decision and the nature of the treatment. In this renewal application, we will continue our efforts to
develop non-invasive, quantitative, and reliable methods to predict the fracture risk of vertebrae with metastatic
cancer under physiologically relevant loading conditions, and to optimize minimally invasive techniques using
novel biomaterials to reconstitute the load bearing capacity of an affected vertebra. In Aim 1, we propose a
novel injectable polymer network that can be self-crosslinked via catalyst-free click chemistry into “click”
organic-inorganic nanohybrid (click-ON) bone cement. Compared to our previous injectable system, the novel
cement has improved biocompatibility, injectability, and crosslinking efficiency. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
efficacy of the optimized click-ON bone cement to both prevent impending fractures and treat existing fractures
in cadaveric models using the clinical vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures, respectively (Aim 2a). Intact
lumbar spines (L1-S1), spines with simulated lytic defects, and spines with biomaterial augmentation will be
tested under accurate and biomimetic loading conditions using a novel robotic testing system. Our previously
developed quantitative computerized tomography based finite element analysis (QCT/FEA) models will be
expanded to include both kinematic motion evaluation and fracture risk prediction under physiological loading
and boundary conditions and validated using the experimental results (Aim 2b). In Aim 3, We will develop a
phantom-less calibration technique to account for the effects of QCT protocols on QCT/FEA results (Aim 3a).
Using the powerful AnalyzeMD platform, we will implement an automated process to further advance the FEA
technique for time efficiency and reproducibility (Aim 3b). We will apply the comprehensive QCT/FEA models
in a retrospective cohort of spine metastasis patients and assess the virtual reconstruction using the click-ON
bone cement as a first step towards clinical translation. The QCT/FEA technique developed in this work takes
into consideration both the quality and quantity of bone and the degeneration status of the intervertebral discs.
This technique allows the clinician to counsel her/his patient regarding activities of daily living that can be
performed with a low risk of spinal fracture. Our future plans are to expand the clinical implementation of the
spinal FEA analysis at Mayo Clinic. We will add FEA evaluation results in our discussion with the patients
regarding our recommendations for their care. We will study the outcome results of those recommendations,
adjust the decision parameters as necessary, and then extend the analysis to additional institutions."
10812350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Electronic health record (EHR) data represent a huge opportunity for cost-efﬁcient clinical and public health
research, especially when a randomized trial or a prospective observational study is not feasible or ethical. EHR
systems, however, are typically developed to support clinical and/or billing activities. As such, substantial care
is needed when using EHR data to address a particular scientiﬁc question. In this, an important potential threat
to validity is missing data. Moreover, since EHR data are not collected for any particular research question, it
will often be the case that measurements that are critical to answering the question will be unavailable in the
record of some patients. This, in turn, requires researchers to contend with the potential for selection bias and
compromised generalizability.
 Towards addressing issues of missing data in an EHR, researchers could, in principle, appeal to a vast
statistical literature and use standard methods such as multiple imputation (MI), inverse-probability weighting
(IPW) or doubly- robust (DR) estimation. These methods, however, have generally been developed outside of the
EHR context. As such, they typically fail to acknowledge the complexity of the EHR data, in particular the many
decisions made by patients and health care providers that give rise to `complete data' in the EHR, known to as
the data provenance. Because of the disconnect between this complexity and the settings for which most missing
data methods are developed, the application of standard missing data methods to EHR-based studies will often
fail to resolve selection bias and generalizability will remain compromised.
 Unfortunately, in contrast to confounding bias, very little attention has been paid to developing methods for
missing data that are speciﬁcally tailored to the complexity of EHR-based studies. We will begin to address this
gap by developing, implementing and evaluating a suite of novel, innovative statistical tools including: Aim 1: A
uniﬁed framework for robust causal inference in unmatched and matched EHR-based cohort studies with missing
confounder data; Aim 2: A formal, robust framework for causal inference in emulated target trials based on EHR
data; Aim 3: A novel blended analysis framework for missing data in EHR-based studies that combines MI and
IPW in an innovative and unique way; Aim 4: A novel double-sampling strategy for when the EHR data are
suspected to be missing-not-at-random.
 The proposed aims are motivated by challenges the investigative team has faced in a series of EHR-based
studies of long-term outcomes among patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. Throughout this research,
we will use data from one of these studies, the DURABLE study, which has rich demographic and longitudinal
clinical information from three Kaiser Permanente health systems on ≈45,000 patients who underwent bariatric
surgery between 1997-2015, as well as on ≈1,636,000 non-surgical enrollees during that time period."
10767906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dementia is the most expensive medical condition in the US. There is an urgent need to intervene to curb
the increasing prevalence of dementia in our population. Strong preliminary data from more than 18 ran-
domized clinical trials demonstrate that computerized, cognitive speed of processing training (SPT) im-
proves cognition and transfers to improved instrumental activities of daily living. Recent evidence further
indicates that SPT may reduce dementia risk. Analyses of 10-year data from the ACTIVE trial revealed
that older adults randomized to SPT were 29% less likely to develop dementia. Moreover, those who com-
pleted additional training had a 48% reduced risk of dementia across 10 years. Two limitations of this
study were a lack of clinical diagnosis of dementia and use of a no-contact control condition. Thus, an im-
portant question is, “Can SPT be successfully implemented to reduce incidence of mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) or dementia?”. Our primary goal is to test the effectiveness of SPT to reduce incidence
of MCI or dementia. The Preventing Alzheimer's with Cognitive Training-PACT field trial advances prior
research by rigorously implementing SPT in a large population of cognitively normal older adults and ex-
amining the primary endpoint of MCI or dementia clinical diagnoses. Older adults are randomized to SPT
or an active control arm of cognitive stimulation (i.e., computer games) and progression to MCI or demen-
tia will be clinically assessed after 3 years. We further will explore if SPT effects are moderated by the de-
gree of amyloid pathology or apolipoprotein E4 status. To demonstrate feasibility, our investigative team is
implementing the study protocol in an R56 phase and successfully enrolled 744 older adults at the time of
proposal submission. Three years after enrollment, we will re-assess study participants to identify those
exhibiting cognitive decline. Such participants will be provided a thorough medical evaluation to clinically
ascertain MCI or dementia diagnosis. Those classified as MCI or dementia will further complete an amy-
loid PET scan and genetic testing. This non-pharmacological prevention trial is innovative with a highly
efficient experimental design and optimized SPT training protocols including an active control group. The
proposed research will determine if SPT successfully reduces incidence of MCI or dementia. This out-
come will be significant in that if an intervention can delay the onset of dementia by only one year, there
will be ~9.2 million fewer cases of the disease by 2050, substantially reducing cost. Positive results would
support use of a relatively inexpensive and easy to apply intervention that could delay or prevent the on-
set of Alzheimer’s disease and/or related dementias. Such an outcome would justify further research to
identify mechanisms of action. Results will inform clinical practice of effective interventions to attenuate
age-related cognitive and functional decline and thereby improve public health."

ABSTRACT
The ACAD Training and Quality Assurance (TQA) core is tasked with building precise and uniform
procedures in the collection of data and its management. The TQA core emphasizes 1) Quality Assurance
(QA), which concentrates on developing and enforcing measures to prevent errors in data collection and
management and 2) Quality Control (QC), which focuses on building infrastructure to effectively identify
and correct errors. To accomplish its aims, the TQA core will establish QA procedures to educate and train
ACAD team members and develop multiple QC measures such as double scoring and identification of
outliers to identify and rectify errors. By reliably collecting and managing data in a standardized manner,
ACAD will produce high-quality harmonizable data that can generate replicable scientific findings. In
addition, the TQA core intends to investigate population-specific error susceptibilities of ACAD measures
using quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally, by making ACAD training materials for administration
of cognitive measures available to qualified clinicians and research scientists, the ACAD TQA core will
increase participation of diverse populations in research and reduce healthcare disparities."
10935935,"SPATIAL MULTIOMICS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
To investigate how disease relevant changes, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are linked to specific risk factors
(e.g., age-related changes, protein aggregates, vascular pathologies, etc.) to alter the spatial arrangement
of cell types in the brain and their gene expression profiles, we need to build high-resolution maps of brain
tissue at the cellular level in individuals with and without pathology. Building these maps requires proper
characterization of the pathological features, as well as a reproducible workflow for data generation and
imaging. To this end, the Spatial Multiomics Core will work closely with the Biospecimen Core, the Integrated
Computational Analysis Core, and the four Projects to provide standardized, high quality generation and
integration of large-scale spatial molecular data. Thus, the overall proposal will directly address an unmet
need in the field to provide state of the art, rigorous, spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic data
acquisition and integration methods, applied to human postmortem tissue at scale. This Core encompasses
the generation of this data required for the research in the four main Projects in this proposal. Specifically,
this Core will perform spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) and multiplexed proteomics using iterative
indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) experiments in postmortem tissue spanning a range of ages and
pathologies and age-matched controls. The overarching aims of this core are: i) to build and optimize robust
workflows based on existing protocols, to thereby enable the generation of Project data at high throughput
and scale (Aims 1 and 2); and ii) to adopt new protocols for imaging-based validation studies on fixed and
frozen tissue, to thereby enable the integration of new technology into the multiomics workflow (Aim 3). The
completion of these objectives will provide a standardized body of data and analysis workflows for the
Projects in this proposal, setting the stage for the careful cell type and gene expression signature analyses
carried out in all of these projects. Finally, this overall framework will ultimately provide a rigorously curated,
large-scale data set that will enable novel understanding of how differing etiologies produce specific
pathological features, how these relate to physiology in each CNS cell type, and how the dysfunction in the
various assemblies of cell types within brain regions lead to differing clinical presentation."

Aging is characterized by the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage resulting in decreasing cellular
functionality; diseases that are particularly associated with aging include cerebrovascular disease and
neurodegenerative diseases. Although focus has been on individual proteinopathies and cerebrovascular
defects that occur more frequently with age, little is known about the local effects of aging on gene expression
signatures and how these effects impact cellular composition and increase susceptibility to disease. Here,
we focus on how ageing alters the cellular environment in three distinct regions of the brain, in patients with
minimal or no pathology, that are known to be susceptible to the effects of protein and/or vascular pathologies
in later life: superior temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and calcarine cortex. We hypothesize that
normal aging will have local and global effects on cell type composition and associated gene
expression/molecular signatures, and that understanding these attributes will allow us to form a better
understanding of why divergence from this state may result in pathology in these vulnerable regions. The aim
of this project is to generate a spatial atlas of normal aging using individuals spanning an age range from 20-
90, all with minimal to no underlying pathology. To achieve this goal, we will use immunohistochemical (4i)
and unbiased transcriptomics (10x Visium ST) techniques to generate a large-volume (300-micron thickness)
3-D atlas of three key brain regions vulnerable to pathology in later life from 30 individuals. We aim to derive
cell type- and molecular signature-specific maps for each subject, integrating these data into a computational
framework to characterize changes in local and global signatures with respect to age. We will then validate
high-value associations derived from this framework in a replication cohort of 20 individuals. Using this
approach, we hope to provide an unprecedented set of cell type and gene expression signature maps that
represent the spectrum of normal aging."
10935939,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging, and results in a variety
of symptoms, the most prominent of which is progressive cognitive decline. Whereas the primary pathological
proteinopathies associated with AD are aggregates of amyloid-beta (plaques) and tau (neurofibrillary
tangles), the appearance, density, and distribution of these proteinopathies shows substantial heterogeneity
across individuals and brain regions. In addition, individuals often display co-occurrence of these two
proteinopathies with other protein aggregates such as TDP43 and alpha-synuclein; these latter two are
primarily associated with diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Frontotemporal Dementia and
Parkinson’s Disease, but their occurrence in AD is not rare. From our bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq
studies on post-mortem tissue, we have identified specific cellular signatures/putative subtypes whose
abundance is associated with tangles and plaques. However, these bulk and single-nucleus experimental
approaches do not preserve spatial information about how these cell types are localized (or not) around
pathological inclusions, and thus generate an incomplete picture of how the cellular structure of the aged
brain is altered in the presence of AD pathology. Here, we aim to examine the spatial distribution and
organization of these cell types directly in intact human brain tissue using highly-multiplexed spatial methods.
We propose a combination of novel but demonstrably scalable protein and gene expression approaches to
study large volumes (300-micron thickness) of human tissue with combinations of these proteinopathies.
These large volumes are necessary to study the full impact of protein aggregates on the “highly local”
environment. Specifically, we use a combination of highly multiplexed antibody staining and genome-wide
spatial transcriptomics methods to examine our hypothesis on the reorganization of neuronal and glial cell
types around pathological inclusions, with a focus on the two major AD-associated proteinopathies (amyloid
and tau). Ultimately, this will generate a high-resolution atlas of cell types and gene expression signatures in
aged human brain tissue that are altered in the presence of protein aggregates commonly found in AD,
complementing many of the existing and ongoing bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq studies in the field of
human neurodegeneration research."

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common, heritable, and serious medical condition associated with a wide
range of adverse health consequences. OSA presents with a heterogeneous set of symptoms that form subtypes
characterized by degrees of excessive sleepiness, disturbed sleep, and a lack of traditional symptoms. Further,
downstream disease risk differs by symptom subtypes. For example, increased cardiovascular risk conferred by
OSA is driven by patients in the excessively sleepy subtype, highlighting the importance of this symptom. This
Project builds off the established existence and relevance of OSA symptom subtypes, and seeks to expand
knowledge by understanding the physiology, genetic architecture and multi-Omics signatures associated with
OSA symptom subtypes, with a particular focus on excessive sleepiness. Aim 1 leverages traditional and novel
electroencephalographic (EEG)-based metrics to assess whether differences in the physiologic response to OSA
explain different symptom manifestations. Prior data suggest patients in different subtypes have similar apnea-
hypopnea index (AHI), but there has not been a detailed examination of other physiological traits. Aim 2 uses
existing data resources to examine the underlying common and rare frequency genetic variation associated with
OSA symptom subtypes, a quantitative measure of excessive sleepiness, and physiological features of OSA
symptom subtypes. Previous studies and our own preliminary data have identified several loci genetic risk loci
for OSA and sleepiness, and highlight a possible relationship of changes in methylomic, transcriptomic, and
metabolomic profiles with OSA and related symptoms. Thus, Aim 3 will apply integrative methods to combine
sequencing data with multi-Omics data from NHLBI's TOPMed Program to identify potential causal genes and
biological pathways through which genetic risk loci operate to affect OSA symptom subtypes and risk factors.
We propose an efficient and cost-effective approach to identify physiological, genetic and other Omic predictors
of OSA symptom subtypes and excessive sleepiness. Ultimately, results will move the field forward by connecting
genetic variation to biological mechanisms and physiological indicators, thus improving our scientific
understanding while identifying new predictors and biological targets for early and precise interventions. The
National Center on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR) has recently identified high priority critical opportunities
to help reach its strategic goals, including identifying biomarkers for sleep disorders and using Omics approaches
to advance precision medicine. This Project speaks directly to these opportunities."
10782000,"Project Summary:
Widespread dissemination together with emergence of tumor cell resistance to existing
therapeutic agents is ultimately responsible for almost 90% of cancer deaths. However,
the metastasis-promoting genetic programs and the underlying signaling networks
orchestrating the progression of the metastatic disease process remain poorly defined.
In order to develop effective anti-metastatic therapeutic agents and improve patient
outcomes, further progress elucidating the fundamental biology of metastasis is needed.
Notably, majority of the comparative genetic studies to date have relied on the primary
tumors and the metastatic lesions to facilitate the identification of genetics factors that
drive tumor progression and dissemination. However, deciphering drivers of metastasis
solely based on the genetic information from solid tumors is limiting due to genetic
divergence and tumor heterogeneity. Since metastatic tumor cells must leave the
primary tumor, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that break free from primary tumors and
seed metastatic lesions are better suited to facilitate comprehensive understanding of
the metastatic disease process. However, efficient capture of CTCs and unbiased
genomic amplification are extremely challenging due to the rarity and fragility of CTCs.
Thus, new technologies and platforms are needed to effectively utilize the biology of
CTCs for systematic identification of metastasis-promoting genetic factors.
Recently we reported the very first genome-scale in vivo CTC CRISPR knockout screen
specifically designed to identify genetic-factors contributing to tumor cell dissemination.
Xenografted tumors were seeded with pooled CRISPR-edited metastatic prostate cancer
cells, each harboring single gene loss-of-function genetic alterations covering all protein
coding genes of the human genome. Using a high-performance microfluidic
immunomagnetic cell sorting approach for efficient CTC capture directly from mouse
blood coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS) for barcoded guide RNA
enrichment analysis, we demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of the use of CTCs
for the identification of critical genetic factors promoting tumor cell dissemination thereby
illuminating targeted routes for inhibiting metastasis driving pathways.
In this project, we will develop a next-generation blood-to-barcode (B2B) chip (Aim1) that
accelerates in vivo CRISPR-based discovery efforts to identify critical genetic factors
impacting metastatic potential. The B2B chip will power a series of in vivo CRISPR
activation screens (Aim2) across a panel of human and mouse metastatic prostate
cancer cell lines strategically selected for modeling broad range of tumor metastatic
potential in vivo as well as origins of metastatic tumors. Collectively, these screens are
anticipated to reveal genetic factors that could be targeted therapeutically to limit the
development of metastatic tumors. Through systematic clinical relevancy prioritization
and validations using a battery of in vitro and in vivo approaches in prostate cancer
model systems (Aim3), clinical utility of our lead genetic factors as targeted anti-
metastatic agents will be established."

 The current FDA-approved responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device offers a promising alternative to
surgery for more than 600,000 Americans with intractable epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery.
Unfortunately, there are no validated biomarkers to predict seizure outcomes before these devices are placed,
and approximately 1/3 of patients do not benefit from RNS long-term. There is a critical need to develop
biomarkers based upon clinical and electrophysiological data to determine the most effective therapy for patients
with medication-resistant seizures, and to bring quantitative rigor to clinical decision making. The long-term goal
of this proposal is to discover and validate a predictive biomarker signature for RNS response that can be used
in epilepsy surgery decision making and broadly adopted. To achieve this goal, our overall objective is to
develop this prognostic biomarker signature using machine learning applied to a carefully selected set of features
and models calculated from intracranial EEG (IEEG) obtained during presurgical evaluation that incorporates
qualitative clinical features. We will collaborate across centers and with industry partners via a novel federated
approach, whereby each clinical site will post data in a common format to their own, private, cloud-based data
store, which will be accessible to analysis pipelines run centrally from our cloud-based platform. Our central
hypothesis is that biomarker signatures derived from multimodal data collected during evaluation prior to device
implant can be used to predict patient response to RNS therapy. Our preliminary data, analyzing 10 RNS patients
each from UCSF, NYU and UPenn, demonstrates our ability to perform the proposed research.
 In the R61 Phase, we will test this hypothesis retrospectively in 125 patients who underwent IEEG prior
to RNS device placement at the UPenn, UCSF and NYU epilepsy centers. Our specific aims for this phase are:
1) To build a federated processing pipeline for biomarker discovery using presurgical evaluation neuroimaging,
IEEG and clinical metadata, 2) To identify a predictive biomarker signature from this data. Our federated analysis
framework will enable us to: (a) accelerate biomarker discovery across multiple sites and industry partners, (b)
satisfy patient and industry limitations on sharing proprietary data, (c) provide a practical framework for rapid
adoption across clinical centers worldwide. In the R33 phase, the biomarker signature will be validated in 100
additional patients followed longitudinally at 9 clinical sites. The proposed research is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by rigorously analyzing multimodal patient data to predict
response to RNS and guide decisions on device implantation. The proposed research is significant because it
has the potential to dramatically improve the success rate of RNS for epilepsy through better patient selection.
This study also puts into place a novel, versatile, federated data mining infrastructure for multi-center and industry
collaboration in translational neuroscience."
10847354,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by a
polyglutamine expansion in the protein ATXN1. In the course of delineating early mechanisms
underlying neurodegeneration, we made the unexpected discovery that ATXN1 directly regulates the
expression of the angiogenic and neurotrophic cytokine VEGF and that VEGF levels are abnormally
low in the SCA1 mouse brain with pathologic consequences. We have since discovered that delivering
recombinant VEGF is therapeutic in the well-characterized SCA1 knock-in mouse (SCA1154Q/2Q;
Q=glutamine), the most precise existing mouse model of SCA1. However, there are several challenges
with developing recombinant VEGF as a therapy. Here we propose to build upon our recent work
developing a VEGF-mimetic particle that could be readily synthesized with a greater potential to
engage VEGF receptors in both neurons and endothelial cells to maintain neurovascular health in
SCA1. The goal is to engineer a first-in-class nanotherapy for SCA1."

Evidence is now robust that asymptomatic carriers contribute to the bulk of malaria transmission in Sub-
Saharan Africa, where 95% of the global malaria burden resides. This is true in both high and low transmission
settings. In areas where malaria control efforts have achieved some success and transmission has declined, it
may be hard to make further progress without interventions targeting the asymptomatic infectious reservoir.
We have worked in rural Bagamoyo district in coastal Tanzania since 2018, characterizing the asymptomatic
reservoir and performing mosquito feeding studies to better understand human-to-mosquito transmission from
low density malaria infections (LMI). This work has involved direct skin feeding assays to measure the
infectivity of > 500 children and adults to Anopheles gambiae, with ongoing analyses examining the
relationship of gametocytemia and other covariates to the likelihood of transmission (infectiousness) and
mosquito infection rates. Now, in conjunction with the University of California San Francisco and the Ifakara
Health Institute, we have the opportunity to leverage this data to understand how treatment of LMI through
periodic active case detection in children can lead to a reduction in gametocyte carriage and the infectious
reservoir. The “Low-density malaria infection (LMI) trial among children in Tanzania” (U01AI155315, PI: Hsiang
and Olotu) will assess whether treating LMI in children results in clinical benefits on long-term health. Over two
years, 200 children in Bagamoyo district randomized to undergo malaria active case detection with molecular
testing (ACDm) will be screened 3 times each year (during biannual transmission peaks and at end of second
peak) using an ultrasensitive PCR, and receive antimalarial therapy if positive. They will also be followed
monthly and treated if they present with fever and are positive on a rapid test, as per standard passive case
detection (PCD). In the comparator arm, 200 children will receive PCD only. In this proposed project, we will
measure gametocytemia from monthly surveillance samples to determine the effects of proactive treatment of
LMI on gametocyte prevalence and gametocyte AUC (area under the curve) in each study arm (Aim 1). Since
reductions in gametocyte carriage will variably translate into reduced transmissibility across individuals based
on factors such as age, symptom status, and seasonality, we will use data from our Bagamoyo skin feed
cohort to model how reductions in gametocytemia translates to a reduction in human-to-mosquito transmission
in both study arms (Aim 2). We hypothesize that active case detection of LMI will reduce gametocyte carriage
and days of infectiousness in children to a greater extent than that achieved by PCD alone. The proposed work
will quantify the potential transmission-reducing benefit of using ultrasensitive diagnostics to actively detect and
treat LMI in African children. Findings will be important to policymakers and advance the science behind efforts
to interrupt transmission and achieve malaria elimination."

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-associated vasculopathy in which there is deposition of
amyloid-β protein in the walls of leptomeningeal and parenchymal blood vessels. It can be seen in association
with Alzheimer’s disease- neuropathologic change (AD-NC), as well as in isolation. In this study, we focus
on how CAA alters the local cellular environment in three distinct regions of the brain that are known to have
variable susceptibility to CAA: superior temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and calcarine cortex.
We will compare CAA in isolation and in association with increasing burden of AD-NC. There is extremely
limited molecular data on how CAA can modify the local cellular environment in aging, although we know
CAA can cause cognitive decline in the absence of any other proteinopathy, but can also exacerbate the
cognitive decline with proteinopathy. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to generate a spatial atlas
of cell types and molecular signatures in cases with CAA and variable severities of Alzheimer’s Disease-
Neuropathologic Change (AD-NC) to assess short- and long-range, and interactive effects of multiple
pathologies on cellular composition and signatures from post-mortem human brain tissue. We hypothesize
that CAA has local effects on the cell type composition and protein signature nearby, affecting all elements
of the neurovascular unit (NVU), and that the effects of CAA are exacerbated by the presence of comorbid
AD proteinopathies. For this project we propose a combination of novel but demonstrably scalable protein
and gene expression approaches, to study large volumes (300-micron thickness) of human tissue with
combinations of CAA with and without AD-NC. This will allow for the generation of a high-resolution atlas of
cell types and gene expression signatures in aged human brain tissue that relate to CAA, complementing
many of the existing and ongoing bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq studies in the field of human
neurodegeneration research"

Estimates suggest that across a period of just 16 years (2001-2017), prevalence of T2D in youth has doubled,
from an estimated prevalence of 0.34 per 1000 youths to 0.67 per 1000 youths. Through our work on the
SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (SEARCH) we have reported that the incidence of T2D is
disproportionately experienced in marginalized racial and ethnic minority groups, with American Indian and
non-Hispanic Black youth experiencing the greatest burden of T2D. We have demonstrated that the well-
known complications and comorbidities of adult-onset T2D, including diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy, arterial stiffness, and hypertension, have an accelerated onset in youth onset T2D.
While it has been well-established that overweight and obesity, together with family history, are associated with
increased risk for development of youth onset T2D, the majority of youth with these risk factors do not develop
T2D. T2D rarely occurs prior to the onset of puberty and it is well-established that puberty is associated with a
decrease in insulin sensitivity, with nadir experienced typically at Tanner Stage III, before returning to pre-
pubertal levels by Tanner Stage V in the healthy adolescent. Youth appear to be at greatest risk for
development of T2D as they progress toward the latter stages of puberty. We propose a longitudinal cohort
study designed to provide deep phenotyping of pathophysiologic markers across the pubertal transition for
high-risk youth with obesity, assessing these factors in relation to underexplored social, behavioral, and early
life risk factors for development of T2D in youth. As one of many clinical sites supporting this Consortium, we
are prepared to enroll 504 youth, from a highly diverse population of youth with obesity and in early to mid-
puberty (Tanner Stage II or III). Operational aims include recruiting and retaining a diverse cohort of at-risk
youth (OA1), sustaining stakeholder engagement to inform the study throughout study planning,
implementation, and dissemination (OA2), and establishing a biobank of participant specimens and samples
from which future ancillary studies can be conducted (OA3). The Scientific Aims supported by these
Operational Aims address the overarching objectives of conducting deep phenotypic characterization of youth-
onset T2D, including assessment of physiologic markers across the pubertal transition (SA 1.), establishing
social and behavioral risk factors for and protective factors against development of youth onset T2D, beyond
that which has already been established (SA 2.), and evaluating genetic and epigenetic data to further
mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis in youth (SA 3.). Ultimately, this work will support
increased understanding of which individuals are at risk for developing youth-onset T2D and allow identification
of determinants of progression from prediabetes to T2D, which will support groundbreaking future prevention
approaches that, once evaluated, could be tailored to individual risk."
10770552,"Basement membranes (BMs) are non-cellular protein layers that simultaneously provide
parenchymal cell-attachment sites and also barriers between tissue compartments. The inner
limiting membrane (ILM) is a special BM that prevents movement into the retina from the
vitreous as such it is a formidable barrier to intravitreal viral-mediated gene transfer or stem cell
transplantation. Current methods to circumvent the ILM involve its physical or enzymatic
removal with limited effectiveness. The consequence has been that successful cell- and gene-
based therapies have targeted a subretinal approach, an effective approach for the outer retina,
but of extremely limited use for the inner retina. The goal of this exploratory project is to
manipulate the molecular structure of the ILM to promote integration of neural stem cells or viral
transfection. ILM formation is dependent on the deposition of laminins, particularly those
containing the β2 subunit. We propose two different manipulations of the laminin polymer
forming the backbone of the ILM: one, genetic and a second, employs a small biomolecule to
disrupt the laminin polymer.
 Our first approach will be to remove genetically a key component of the ILM, Lamb2. Our
prior studies show this disrupts the sheet-like nature of the ILM. We will test if this molecular
rearrangement of the ILM renders these retinae more permeant to cell and virus entry. Second
approach will be to disrupt laminin polymerizing; netrins, small matrix molecules with laminin
homology, are known to disrupt laminin polymerization during normal development and in
experimental conditions. We will produce netrin-induced focal disruptions of the ILM and assay
for facilitated gene and cell integration.
 We will perform our experiments, in vitro using organotypic cultures of retina as well as in
vivo murine models. The in vitro approach has the advantage that we can add back laminin and
reconstitute the ILM and thereby proving that laminin manipulation is the key step. The in vivo
approach is more clinically relevant. While in this exploratory project, we will use murine models
future successor applications could employ more clinically relevant animal models.
 Together, the experiments in this project will assess the barrier that the ILM presents to
biologic-based engraftment therapies. They will determine if specifically disrupting the laminin
backbone is enough to promote engraftment. These experiments if successful will provide a
powerful tool to promote advanced matrix-based approach to manipulation of retinal BMs to
promote gene-based and cell-based therapeutics in the inner retinal disease."

Genetic mutations that confer autism (ASD) risk often occur in genes that comprise signal transduction networks
that link synaptic transmission to downstream changes in gene expression. However, the dynamic, network-
scale behavior of these complex and interconnected signaling networks in normal or disease states is poorly
understood. This is the first renewal application of a highly productive R01 grant that built a quantitative multiplex
co-immunoprecipitation or QMI panel to study the dynamic activity of a 20-member protein interaction network
(PIN), consisting of glutamate receptors, scaffolds, and signal transduction molecules; mutations in the genes
encoding all target proteins have been genetically linked to autism. Using QMI, we discovered that this PIN
encodes information by varying the composition and intensity of modules of coordinated interactions in response
to incoming signals. Moreover, we found that mutations that contribute to autism risk disrupt synaptic PINs
by causing them to assume a network state that resembles the state of a wildtype neuron that has
undergone homeostatic scaling. This results in a reduced dynamic range of the network to change in response
to subsequent stimuli, and leads to a systems-level disturbance in basal glutamate tone (as reflected in disrupted
E/I balance). In the second cycle we focus on the question of, can we normalize ASD PINs, and will this
normalization correlate with functional rescue of phenotypes? In Aim 1, we focus on normalization via FYN
kinase, which we identified as a dysregulated network hub in FMR1-/y mice downstream of synaptic plasticity
inputs. Preliminary data demonstrate that inhibition of hyperactive FYN signaling normalizes hyperactive protein
synthesis and behavior; we propose to perform an extensive battery of molecular, cellular and behavioral assays
to investigate the potential of FYN inhibition to treat the phenotypes of FMR1 deficiency. In Aim 2, we extend our
network-scale analysis to a second PIN critical to synaptic plasticity, the mTOR network. We use
pharmacological and genetic inhibition of mTOR to model information flow through the mTOR PIN during
synaptic plasticity, and to establish which components of the pathway are required for homeostatic scaling, in
vivo or in vitro. In Aim 3, we focus on PIN normalization by manipulating synaptic activity. We attempt to `un-
scale' the synaptic PIN of ASD-mutation-carrying mice, and measure if this treatment is able to restore normal
PIN activity and the ability of the neuron to undergo normal homeostatic scaling. Critically, this last experiment
will reveal whether altered levels of neuronal activity downstream of developmental mechanisms cause disrupted
synaptic and mTOR signal transduction, or conversely if ongoing deficits in signal transduction are independent,
or even causative, of altered basal activity levels. Overall, this renewal would continue our investigations into the
molecular network mechanisms by which ASD risk genes disrupt synaptic signal transduction."
10884157,"The objective of the proposed work is to develop a vaccine that provides broad protection against group 1
influenza A viruses – a group that includes the 1918, 1957-1958, and 2009 pandemic viruses, as well as avian
influenza “viruses of concern” – by eliciting a robust and durable immune response targeting the highly
conserved membrane-proximal stalk domain of hemagglutinin (HA). The project will test the hypothesis that
the combination of shielding the variable head domain of HA, refocusing the immune response to the highly
conserved stalk domain by controlling the orientation of HA, and multivalent presentation, will provide broad,
durable, and robust protection against group 1 influenza A viruses. Influenza represents a serious global health
problem, with seasonal influenza virus infections imposing significant health and economic burdens, and
pandemics caused by novel influenza viruses representing an even more serious threat. Licensed vaccines
induce an immune response that primarily targets the head domain of HA, which is highly variable in
sequence. As a result, the immune response to influenza vaccination is narrow and strain-specific and would
provide little protection against potential pandemic influenza viruses. While “broadly neutralizing” antibodies
targeting the highly conserved stalk domain of HA are prophylactically and therapeutically protective against
influenza virus challenges in vivo, such antibodies are not elicited effectively in natural infections or by licensed
influenza vaccines. The immunosubdominance of the HA stalk domain may result from its membrane-proximal
location, with interactions of B-cell receptors with conserved stalk epitopes being blocked by steric hindrance
on virions which are densely packed with glycoproteins. Indeed, we have recently shown that tuning the
orientation of HA to enhance the accessibility of stalk epitopes results in an enhanced protective stalk-directed
immune response. Furthermore, we have demonstrated an approach (tethered antigenic suppression) for
suppressing the immune response to the head domain of HA and refocusing the immune response on desired
epitopes (such as the stalk). We have also designed vaccines that elicit a robust protective antibody response
against a variety of antigens, including HA, by displaying them multivalently from virus-like particles. The first
aim of the proposed work is to engineer and test novel HA antigen designs to provide an enhanced stalk-
directed immune response. We will shield the head domain of HA to suppress its immunogenicity and will tune
the orientation of the head-shielded HA to increase the accessibility of the stalk domain and enhance its
immunogenicity. We will also investigate the ability to further increase the breadth of protection by using
engineered HA antigens that incorporate stalk domains from different viral subtypes. The second aim is to
characterize the breadth and the longevity of the anti-stalk response induced by vaccination in mice. The third
aim is to characterize immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy in naïve and pre-immunized, male and female
ferrets."

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) commonly occurs in critically ill patients in the ICU. Patients with severe AKI often
require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) because it enables hemodynamic stability and better
volume control. Anticoagulation therapy is frequently used to keep the CRRT circuit (especially the blood filter)
from clotting as many critically ill patients are prothrombotic, and/or when CRRT is commonly performed for
multiple days. However, both systemic heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation therapy are associated with
higher costs, increased circuit complexity, and complications. Consequently, we propose to develop an
anticoagulant-free blood filter (the HemoCartridge) based on the ultra-high-flux and blood compatible silicon
nanopore membrane (SNM) technology for extended extracorporeal applications. The HemoCartridge will
operate clot free with little to no anticoagulation for the length of a CRRT session to eliminate the costs,
complexity, and complications of administering anticoagulation therapy, reduce blood loss, reduce the cost of
CRRT due to filter clotting and replacement, and reduce the risk of not delivering an adequate dialytic dose to
the critically ill AKI patient. In this SBIR Phase II proposal, we will develop a clinical-scale HemoCartridge and
then assess uremic toxin clearance and hemocompatibility on the bench top and in the anephric porcine
model."

Availability of large longitudinal datasets describing elderly populations with schizophrenia treated in usual care
settings present opportunities to expand the limited evidence on outcomes of antipsychotic drug treatment for
this population and to learn what works in the real world: which drugs, in what sequence, combination, or
intensity, for whom (what racial/ethnic groups, in what social circumstances), and at what risk. While this
objective is not new, advances in machine learning and causal inference could improve inferences, and thus
generate evidence to answer these questions. Leveraging data generated in usual care settings, we will (a)
translate novel statistical methods to assure distributional balance on observed confounders using high-
dimensional longitudinal data with multiple competing antipsychotic drugs (multi-valued treatments) and
longitudinal treatment patterns (treatment regimens); (b) utilize robust non-parametric or semi-parametric
methods; and (c) extend tree-based approaches to simultaneously model effectiveness and safety outcomes to
fill evidence gaps. We will link racially/ethnically diverse cohorts of elderly publicly-insured adults with
schizophrenia utilizing antipsychotics to geographical indicators of social contextual factors– upstream social
determinants of health (SDH) such as household income and crime rates— that are known to influence
treatment adherence and other health behaviors. Aim 1 applies causal effect estimation of the index
antipsychotic drug prescribed using weighted semi-parametric or non-parametric methods that (a) depend on
high-dimensional confounders and (b) may be moderated by patient race/ethnicity and area-level SDH. Aim 2
identifies and characterizes frequently observed treatment regimens that may differ by race/ethnicity and SDH.
Aim 3 estimates effectiveness and safety of the treatment regimens identifed in Aim 2, and determines if

Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a hugely destructive public health problem that is surging worldwide,
including in many parts of the US and Asia. Thailand is an optimal site for studying the genetics of MUD, owing
to lower genetic and environmental heterogeneity than in the US, and lower research costs, in the greater
context of a devastating and widespread Thai epidemic of MUD, The Principal Investigators have formed the
international relationships and established the logistical infrastructures necessary for human genetic studies of
drug use disorders, including MUD, in Thailand, as shown during the prior iteration of this project; we collected
>4000 MUD-informative subjects (cases and exposed controls), twice the promised sample. Leveraging our
established and effective collaborations (Thanyarak Institute and Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok; Suan
Prung Hospital in Chiang Mai), our successful prior work supports the feasibility of this project. We will collect
and characterize a biobank sample for studies of substance use disorders (SUDs), especially MUD, as well as
other psychiatric disorders and behaviors. 6000 subjects will be recruited in Bangkok (primarily at SUD
treatment facilities) and 4000 in Chiang Mai (at Suan Prung, the major psychiatric hospital in the north of
Thailand and in the community); 10,000 in total, balanced with equal numbers of cases and non-MUD matched
controls. Subjects will be evaluated via the Thai MIND biobank instrument (the Thai version of an instrument
developed for a Million Veteran Program (MVP) project from previously-validated assessment modules). All
subjects' DNA will then be subjected to 3x low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at the Yale Center for
Genome Analysis, variants called, and the dataset subjected to genomewide association analyses. WGS will
allow the identification of common, rare, and copy number variants. We will undertake meta-analysis with other
East Asian (e.g. Taiwan – 2200 cases, 4400 controls) populations to increase power, and conduct trans-
ancestry meta-analyses with diverse ancestry groups (from the MVP sample and other large-scale biobanks
and cohorts). Following the identification of risk variants, we will use multiple approaches to investigate and
model MUD and other SUD polygenicity, and pleiotropy more broadly. We will also investigate the relationship
between genetic risk for MUD and other psychiatric traits, and implement causal inference analysis to
disentangle the pleiotropy of MUD with other psychiatric traits and disorders. Combining our newly-recruited
Thai cohort with our earlier Thai sample and other samples of diverse ancestral backgrounds will permit us to
fine-map MUD-associated loci and identify causal alleles across ancestry-specific LD patterns. Data will be
made available to the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and results shared broadly. Results from this study
have the potential to advance greatly our understanding of genetic risk factors for MUD, especially in East
Asian populations underrepresented in genetic studies, leading to an improved understanding of the
neurobiology of MUD and, ultimately, improved approaches to its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10-15% of US adults including 30-40% of persons with diabetes
mellitus (DM), is associated with poor outcomes, and often progresses to requiring dialysis or transplantation.
Half of all Americans with CKD also have DM. While traditional and emerging pharmacotherapies are often
used in CKD with diabetes (CKD/DM), the synergistic role of dietary interventions has not been well
examined. Low-carbohydrate low-fat diets are often recommended in DM, whereas low-protein diets (LPDs)
are recommended for non-diabetic CKD with increasing emphasis on plant-based protein sources. Evidence
suggests that high-protein diets with greater animal protein content may lead to glomerular hyperfiltration and
faster decline in renal function in patients with CKD/DM. There remains major controversy regarding the
potential risks vs. benefits of plant-based diets in CKD/DM, for which guidelines remain based on expert
opinion. Given conventional dietary restrictions for the management of DM, there is concern that plant-based
LPDs may lead to protein-energy wasting and hyperkalemia, whereas these diets may indeed be most
beneficial in patients with CKD/DM given their faster rates of CKD progression as compared to non-diabetics.
At present, clinical practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations regarding the amount (low vs.
high) and source (plant vs. animal) of dietary protein intake (DPI) in CKD/DM. Given that prior dietary trials in
CKD such as the 1994 Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study excluded CKD/DM and did not
examine the optimal proportion of plant vs. animal-based proteins, there is urgent unmet need for a rigorous
dietary intervention study to examine the efficacy and safety of patient-centered plant-based diets in CKD/DM.
 In the spirit of PAS 20-160 (Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting NIDDK Diseases) we propose a pilot
feasibility randomized controlled trial, conducted in parallel with patients' routine follow-up visits at two CKD
clinics within the University of California Irvine, to test the feasibility and safety of implementing a Plant-
Focused Nutrition in CKD/DM (PLAFOND) diet with a DPI of 0.6-0.8 g/kg/d comprised of >2/3 plant-based
sources, vs. standard-of-care renal diet with <1/3 plant-sources and low-potassium content, administrated by
dietitians, over a 6-month period in 120 patients with CKD/DM stage 3-5. We will determine whether the
PLAFOND diet vs. the standard-of-care renal diet can be adhered to with consistent separation in dietary
protein and plant-based proportions at 3- and 6-months. We will also examine nutritional status, physical
performance, and body composition, as well as glycemic measures using traditional metrics and continuous
glucose monitoring, while other biochemical parameters and patient-reported outcomes including CKD-related
symptoms will also be studied. In addition to providing the requisite feasibility and safety data of patient-
centered dietary regimens needed for the design and conduct of future multi-center trials, our proposed study
will have major immediate impact by reinvigorating the critical role of dietary management of CKD/DM."

The major objectives of the proposed research are to illuminate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
control developmental plasticity and to investigate how post-mitotic differentiated cells in an intact animal can be
reprogrammed and remodeled into new cell types in the process of transdifferentiation (Td). The well-described
pathway for endoderm development in C. elegans will be applied to molecularly dissecting Td and
“transorganogenesis” (conversion of one organ into another). One component in this pathway, the C. elegans
ELT-7 GATA transcription factor, is capable of converting differentiated, post-mitotic cells of two organs, the
pharynx and uterus, into cells with gene expression patterns and ultrastructural characteristics of normal gut
cells. Highly dynamic changes in the transcriptome occur during this remarkable process, and six stages
(promiscuity, attenuation, extinction, rebound, persistence, and remodeling) can be resolved during Td based
on gene expression and altered cellular and organ morphology. These events define Td-competent (Td+) cells
that convert to gut-like cells and Td-resistant (Td-) cells that only transiently permit ELT-7 to activate its target.
Among the genes whose expression undergoes upregulation during Td are sets of genes associated with protein
turnover, autophagy, and the intracellular pathogen response (IPR), suggesting that these pathways play a role
in Td. On the basis of ELT-7-induced developmental arrest, two genetic selections were developed that identify
large numbers of mutants defective in Td. With these preliminary findings in hand, we will probe the mechanisms
of Td through three Specific Aims. In SA1, we will investigate the dynamics of cellular remodeling, test the
hypothesis that turnover processes of protein degradation and autophagy participate in key stages of Td and
remodeling, assess the role of the IPR in Td, and investigate the action of cell-cycle exit in the Td process. In
SA2, we will evaluate whether differences between single Td+ and Td- cells of varied differentiated cell types can
be ascribed to their unique transcriptome dynamics and will test the hypothesis that changes in chromatin
architecture of Td- cells, assessed by ATAC-seq, initially and transiently proceed through similar patterns to
those of Td+ cells, with elastic reversion to the original state. In SA3, we will characterize mutants from two
genetic selections that are defective in ELT-7-mediated developmental arrest and Td and will use them to
investigate interdependence of the six stages of Td. We will identify the causal gene(s) underlying large numbers
of mutants defective in Td by a high-throughput method based on statistical analysis of variants in pooled
genome-wide sequences, including those coding for proteins and non-coding RNAs. These studies may advance
our understanding of mechanisms involved in pre-cancerous metaplasias of the digestive tract. They will also
provide insights into the mechanisms of organ malformation in birth defects and could lead to methods for
reprogramming differentiation for organ generation in regenerative medicine."

The United States currently has the highest COVID-19 infection and related mortality rates in the world. In
California, Latinos account for the highest percent of COVID-19 cases (58.9%) and deaths (47.3%) and are
disproportionately represented in occupations deemed as ‘essential’. Latinos also suffer from higher rates of
poverty and chronic disease which places them at greater risk of COVID-19 infection and related complications.
In collaboration with Family Health Centers of SD (FHCSD) and working with Community Health Workers (aka,
promotores/as), we will implement a tailored intervention to reduce household- and community- spread of
COVID-19 among Latinos. Households of recently diagnosed Latino adults (n=256 households) will be
randomized to one of two groups: 1) Standard-of-Care comparison group, 2) COVID-19 promotor/a Intervention,
who will receive standard of care plus tailored counseling delivered by promotores/as. This project will test the
immediate, mid-term, and long-term efficacy of the promotor/a intervention to prevent household and community
spread of COVID-19. In addition, we will test the efficacy of the proposed intervention on short- and long-term
behavioral, mental, and physical health outcomes. This study aims to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in a
population that has exceptionally high rates of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. We will harness our
research team’s extensive experience in developing multi-level interventions working with promotores/as to
promote behavior change among Latinos, and leverage a strong community-academic collaboration that
maximizes community impact and sustainability. This research will lead to the development of sustainable and
scalable community-academic models designed to respond quickly, efficiently, and effectively to both this
existing and future public health threats."
10757461,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) remains the only curative modality for
patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies and many nonmalignant hematologic
disorders (genetic disorders and immunodeficiency disorders). Graft vs host disease (GVHD) is
the major complication and cause of non-relapse mortality in allogeneic HSCT. GVHD is
attributable to donor T cell recognition of recipient alloantigen, presenting commonly in skin, liver
and gastrointestinal (GI-GVHD). Initial clinical suspicion of GI-GVHD is made by symptoms of
severe weight loss and increased stool output >500cc (500->1500)per day, without other cause
identified. Clinical diagnosis of GI-GVHD separately from chemotherapy/infectious colitis (CI-
Colitis) requires colonoscopy/endoscopy followed by biopsy, but has < 60% intra-expert
variability of pathological diagnosis. To overcome these limitations in diagnosis of GI-GVHD, we
propose to: 1) test the safety of Clinical MSOT detecting oxy-/deoxy-hemoglobin,
total hemoglobin, and collagen contrast in patients with GI-GVHD and to 2) evaluate the
potential of clinical MSOT to differentiate GI-GVHD from chemotherapy/infectious colitis
(CI-Colitis) to ultimately increase diagnostic accuracy, decrease patient risk, and decrease time
to therapy.
Building upon our experience in HSCT and autoimmune responses in patients, as well as
experience with multispectral optoacoustic tomography, these proposed studies aim to assess
the potential of MSOT imaging to differentiate GVHD from CI-Colitis with the ultimate goal
to provide patients a transabdominal non-invasive, accurate and objective method to
identify disease for individual patients in support of personalized medicine. We
hypothesize that clinical MSOT imaging is safe for patients with compromised immune
systems and that clinical MSOT can distinguish GVHD from CI-Colitis based upon a
combination of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin and collagen. We will test this hypothesis by
the following Aims: 1) Assess safety of clinical features of MSOT in patients with GI-GVHD
or CI-Colitis; and 2) Evaluate potential of clinical MSOT to identify and stratify GI-GVHD in
HSCT patients. Our study will be the first to test clinical MSOT in HSCT patients and the first
proposed study to use MSOT differentiate diseases of similar clinical presentation but
radically different therapies."
10935932,"This proposal, to create the 3D Aging & Alzheimer Brain Program, addresses several critical gaps in ongoing efforts to bridge the divide between known risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the syndromic manifestations of the disease. The significant gaps are in: i) how the neurobiology of aging-related cognitive decline may provide insights into enhancing resilience; ii) understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD susceptibility loci and diversification of AD target genes and how these genes cause a cellular effect; and iii) key topological and morphometric information when using current sequencing approaches on cortical tissue to implicate cellular subtypes contributing to disease. To address these gaps, we propose a comprehensive program to systematically generate and analyze multiple interconnected reference data sets, that includes diverse individuals, to (a) characterize the individual and synergistic effects that AD proteinopathies, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and aging itself have on the molecular and cellular architecture of the older neocortex and (b) identify those aspects that contribute to cognitive decline, the clinically meaningful outcome of AD. To this end, our Program targets three brain regions to capture the effects of a range of different neuropathologies. We will establish three large-volume molecular atlases of: 1) the aging brain by sampling the entire lifespan in individuals with minimal neuropathologic burden to investigate the effect of aging itself in the brain; 2) the impact of amyloid and tau proteinopathies, including specific representative cases to capture the independent and synergistic effects of β-amyloid and tau alone and in combination with α-synuclein and TDP-43 proteinopathies; and 3) the impact of CAA to yield new insights into a very different aspect of amyloid proteinopathy and its impact on the neurovascular unit. We will then establish a reference dataset of molecular data in 300 diverse individuals to enable the assessment of spatial molecular features in relation to pathological and cognitive outcomes. In parallel to the development of these atlases and reference datasets, we will optimize experimental protocols for spatial transcriptomics and iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) to facilitate large-scale projects and enable enhanced data generation over existing, baseline capabilities. We will distribute all protocols and data through the NIA-funded AD Knowledge portal, which already hosts multiomic data from the same cohorts and participants, to accelerate repurposing of the data. Finally, we will create MAAP-Brain, a 3-D interactive data visualizer, so that all investigators and particularly non-computational scientists, can interact with our data and results. The Program team brings together a highly complementary cast of talented junior and senior scientists, and it rests on a foundation of multiple intersecting long-term collaborative research programs that position it well to achieve all its deliverables towards advancing our understanding of the complex clinico-spatial-molecular features that contribute to aging and AD, which will provide needed resources to the broader scientific community."
10773001,"PROJECT 2 – RNA-SPLICING DYSREGULATION IN CANCER
PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of Project 2 is to understand the various roles of alternative splicing in pancreatic and
breast cancer, and to exploit cancer-specific features of this process to develop targeted-therapeutic
approaches. Cancer cells display extensive qualitative and quantitative dysregulation of splicing, and a subset
of the isoforms that are inappropriately expressed contribute to tumorigenesis or altered cell metabolism. The
mechanisms and pathways through which the splicing-factor oncoprotein SRSF1 accelerates transformation of
pancreas ductal cells, and its reciprocal regulation with mutant KRAS, will be investigated. The spliceosomal
core component BCAS2 will be studied to understand the impact of its elevated expression on alternative splicing
and tumorigenesis in pancreatic and breast cancers. Organoid models, as well as orthotopic and genetic mouse
models, will be used to study tumorigenesis promoted by these splicing factors when their expression is elevated
in pancreatic or breast cancer, with an emphasis on basal-like subtypes. High-throughput RNA-sequencing and
computational analyses will be employed to identify and compare the affected splicing targets of SRSF1 and
BCAS2 in these different cancer contexts, and selected target isoforms will be characterized and manipulated to
evaluate their contributions to tumorigenesis and potential as therapeutic targets. One key event, alternative
splicing of pyruvate kinase M pre-mRNA, which controls the distinctive glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells, will
be thoroughly investigated as a potential therapeutic target, by specifically manipulating this process in vitro and
in vivo, using antisense technology and organoid and mouse models of pancreatic and breast cancer."
10771160,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proteome is a quantitative output of a genome and the ultimate effector of cellular functions. Yet
remarkably little is known about the logic behind proteome construction. The goal of my research program is to
understand the evolutionary driving forces and the molecular processes that shape protein levels in living cells.
Using bacterial model systems, my lab takes a holistic approach by developing quantitative technologies to
measure, manipulate, and model the expression stoichiometry of co-regulated proteins and the effect of
imbalanced production on bacterial growth, survival, and colonization. This current grant seeks to answer
several fundamental questions regarding the physiology and regulation of protein stoichiometry.
 At the physiological level, we use molecular and theoretical methods to determine 1) the optimality of
protein production rates for every gene and the cellular responses to non-optimal levels, 2) the precise ratios of
protein production upon sudden environmental changes and the consequences of imbalanced production, and
3) the theoretical basis for the stoichiometry of proteins that function together. These studies will help elucidate
new principles for building a proteome and provide a new way of thinking about protein imbalance in disease.
 To understand the regulatory principles of gene expression behind this stoichiometric protein production,
we use quantitative and massively parallel assays to determine 1) the sequence determinant of Rho-
dependent transcription termination in Bacillus subtilis, whose RNAP polymerases outpace ribosomes
(`runaway transcription'), 2) the molecular basis of runaway transcription, 3) a predictive model for the
efficiency of Rho-independent transcription termination, and 4) the landscape of translational control for
bacteriophage mRNAs. Our studies in these areas will help establish a critically needed framework for
predicting gene expression from genomic sequences and advance fundamental knowledge of bacterial gene
regulation. We anticipate that our mechanistic dissection, coupled with systems-level inquiry into proteome
composition, will make bacterial model organisms the first system for which we have a quantitative
understanding of the interplay between genome, proteome, and fitness."
10836976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The fundamental view of bacterial cells is that they are not organized because they generally
lack membrane-bound organelles. Despite the textbook perception that bacteria are
disorganized, a growing array of non-membrane-bound organelles called “biomolecular
condensates” have been identified. These condensates are formed through the physical
process of liquid-liquid phase separation and have the capacity to selectively organize enzymes
and substrates into distinct subcellular locations, suggesting bacterial cells may be highly
organized. The Schrader lab identified the first bacterial condensate in the bacterium C.
crescentus, termed the BR-body, which was found to organize the bacterial RNA decay
machinery, facilitating its complex multi-step biochemical pathway. Bioinformatic signatures of
BR-bodies have been identified across bacteria including many pathogens, suggesting they are
broadly conserved. In addition, several bacterial biomolecular condensates have subsequently
been identified that are involved in diverse biochemical pathways, suggesting that bacterial cells
are generally organized by non-membrane-bound organelles, yet the number and diversity of
such structures remains poorly characterized. By combining in vivo imaging experiments and in
vitro biochemistry we seek to define the important aspects of biomolecular condensate function
and diversity in bacteria. We believe that many of the characteristics of C. crescentus BR-
bodies will be shared in pathogenic organisms, potentially leading to the identification of new
antibiotic targets."

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a clinical condition that includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a clot in the
deep veins of the legs and pelvis, and pulmonary embolism (PE), a clot in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary
emboli are primarily a consequence of a dislodged DVT clot that travels from the deep veins to the lungs,
obstructing blood flow; they are too often fatal. The aim of this proposal is to identify genetic variation
associated with venous clot embolization to the lungs in those with a DVT and to characterize the biology and
pathology underlying this process. Little is known about factors associated with embolization, including genetic
factors, and the knowledge gap is wide. The only established genetic predictor of embolization is rs6025
variant in the coagulation factor V (FV) structural gene (F5); rs6025 has been shown repeatedly to be a
stronger predictor of DVTs without a PE (odds ratios [OR] ~4.8) than of DVTs with a PE (OR ~2.1). We know a
lot about the functional consequence of the F5 variant rs6025 on FV protein function, but our understanding
does not explain the differential DVT-PE effect. We have preliminary data indicating that another non-
synonymous F5 variant, rs4524—not in linkage disequilibrium with rs6025—is also differentially associated
with DVT-PE risk. Further, this differential in DVT-PE risk for the F5 variants is not observed for other well-
established VTE variants, including F2 (prothrombin) and ABO. No large-scale genetic discovery effort has
been undertaken to identify new loci differentially associated with DVT-PE risk, nor has a systematic
investigation of known loci been pursued to characterize the underlying biology. The aims of this proposal will
address these scientific gaps. The research settings are the International Network Against Venous Thrombosis
(INVENT) Consortium, which has amassed over 35,000 VTE cases from 15 studies with genome-wide
markers, and the Wolberg Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which specializes in
mechanisms of clot formation, structure, and stability. There are 3 aims. Aim 1: VTE Sub-phenotyping: Using
existing study information on the classification of VTE, we will sub-phenotype 35,049 VTE cases to identify
those with DVT alone and those with PE, with or without a diagnosed DVT. Aim 2: Genetic Discovery: We will
then conduct a genome-wide association study meta-analysis that estimates the risk of PE among those with a
DVT. Agnostic and candidate-variant testing will be conducted. Replication will be conducted in over 12,000
VTE cases. Aim 3: Functional Biology: We will conduct functional interrogations of genes and their variants that
are known to be differentially associated with DVT-PE risk. Our approach will be to provide biologic evidence
from systematic and reductive, function-focused experiments. Initial work will focus on F5 rs6025 and rs4524;
subsequent work will interrogate other novel associations in functional assays of clot formation, structure, and
stability. This work will advance our biologic understanding of venous clot embolization to the lungs and may
present opportunities to reduce fatalities attributable to PE."
10767325,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects ~1% of all live births in the United States. Over 85% of individuals with
CHD now live well into adulthood1–4, exposing a burden of non-cardiac disabilities, such as neurodevelopmental
disabilities. In fact, over half of all children with moderate or complex CHD suffer from neuropsychological deficits,
with impaired executive functions (EF) the most common. EF are critical higher-order neurocognitive functions
important for independent living and mental health. However, predicting who will be more impaired and in need
of intervention is challenging, as routinely measured patient and medical factors explain only one-third of the
variance in outcomes. Because impaired EF is particularly amenable to treatment, better predictors of EF are
needed to appropriately allocate services and improve outcomes. To develop such methods, we first focus on
dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA). Among the severe forms of CHD, d-TGA is the more common,
occurring in 3/10,000 live births. d-TGA leads to severe in utero hypoxia that is corrected soon after birth with
an arterial switch operation. Additional surgery and cardiovascular sequelae are rare. Thus d-TGA patients have
the most uniform postnatal course of all CHDs but, like other CHDs, is associated with hypoxia and has significant
yet variable impairment in EF. This project leverages adult d-TGA subjects being studied under R01HL135061
and d-TGA patients involved in prior Boston trials to create the largest, best characterized d-TGA cohort to date.
We propose to perform sophisticated image analysis on brain MRI data and add genetic testing focused on
neuroresilience and hypoxia response genes. First, we will employ our sulcal pattern analysis to determine the
extent of in utero alterations in brain development, as sulcal patterns are determined prenatally and remain stable
into adult life. Second, we will explore the rich club structural and functional networks to separate highly
connected central hubs (rich club) that form early in life from less connected peripheral regions which are thought
to be adaptive. The overarching goal of this study is to use novel MRI analyses to determine the brain
organizational changes associated with altered EF and the modulating role of neuroresilience and hypoxia
response genes in adults with d-TGA. Toward these ends, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1.
Determine the relationship between sulcal patterns and executive function in adults with d-TGA and if this
relationship is modified by (a) presence of neuro-resilience gene ApoE ε2 or ε4 alleles, or (b) variants in hypoxia
response genes. Aim 2/3. Determine the relationship between structural/functional connectivity using rich club
and executive function in adults with d-TGA and if this relationship is modified by (a) presence of neuro-resilience
gene ApoE ε2 or ε4 alleles or (b) variants in hypoxia response genes. Successful completion would help
determine brain changes associated with altered EF and the potential modulating role of neuroresilience and
hypoxia response genes as well as inform the balance of in utero versus adaptive changes. This knowledge is
relevant to the larger CHD group and will inform the need for prenatal versus postnatal interventions."
10745960,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants
of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on
chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic
Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and
effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of
racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in
clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the
presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and
4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This
incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’.
Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of
sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air
pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy
metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately
exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large
datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1-
kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the
association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on
~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the
association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top
performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then
assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of
neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse
studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the
interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney
disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this
interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for
APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease."
10747383,"Project Summary/Abstract
 A key driver of cancer is the global deregulation of transcription networks in the cell. Transcriptional output
is dependent on chromatin structure and topology; repressed genes are sequestered from active genes into
regions of compacted DNA near the nuclear membrane. Dense chromosomal domains, termed heterochromatin,
are associated with Heterochromatin Protein-1 (HP1) and are tethered to the periphery via an interaction with
the nuclear transmembrane protein, Lamin Binding Receptor (LBR), and the intermediate filament protein, Lamin
B. Consequently, cancer cells that undergo global rewiring of transcription also often exhibit aberrant protein
expression of Lamin B, LBR and HP1. The physical manifestation of the misregulation of these proteins is
distortion in the size and shape of the nuclear envelope. Indeed, this nuclear pleomorphism is used as a
histological marker of tumor progression. In estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients,
downregulation of HP1 and upregulation of Lamin B and LBR is strongly correlated with earlier occurrence of
distal metastasis. Understanding the biophysical properties that govern the assembly of heterochromatin at the
nuclear periphery will facilitate the development of therapies aimed at restoring proper gene regulation. HP1 was
recently found to concentrate DNA and chromatin into liquid-liquid phase separated (LLPS) droplets in vitro. This
suggests a potential mechanism of DNA organization in vivo. To investigate the molecular details of HP1-
mediated compaction and phase separation, I utilized DNA curtains and confocal microscopy. I identified key
regions of HP1 required for multivalent—LLPS interactions and DNA compaction. This preliminary research
focused on DNA, and the graduate work in Aim 1 will build on these studies by evaluating HP1 interactions with
complex nucleosomal substrates. Heterochromatin in vivo is distinguished by evenly spaced nucleosomes and
the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3). I will make chromatin substrates that range from mono-
nucleosomes to 50kb chromatin fibers with variations in spacing and methylation modification. I will monitor the
binding, oligomerization and phase separation of HP1 on these substrates by a combination of bulk biochemical
assays and a novel single molecule chromatin assay. The proposed postdoctoral research in Aim 2 will focus
on determining a physical model of the nuclear periphery. I will reconstitute the interactions between chromatin
and the lamina with single molecule studies in vitro and super resolution studies in cells. I will use cell lines and
mouse models of breast cancer metastasis to determine the molecular mechanism guiding metastatic recurrence
of ER+ breast cancer patients with high expression of Lamin B and LBR. This research program will propel me
toward my ultimate goal of leading my own lab studying how nuclear topology is coupled to cell fate determination
in development, and the misregulation that leads to disease."
10850771,"Project Summary
In some cancers, intriguingly, the same mutation results in drastically different disease phenotypes in different
patients. An example is a type of blood cancer, known as myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), where a single
nucleotide change in the JAK2 gene, may result in either an increase in the number of red blood cells, an increase
in the number of platelets, or scarring of bone marrow tissue, in different patients. The disease outcome is just
as unpredictable. Some patients show no symptoms for decades whereas others rapidly progress to acute
leukemias. This disconnect between genotype and phenotype may be due to the identity of the hematopoietic
stem cell (HSC) in which the mutation first occurs. Not all HSCs are equivalent and some may preferentially give
rise to certain types of blood cells. Additionally, the subsequent expansion of the population of mutated stem
cells may be different in different patients. Therefore, to understand the heterogeneity in disease presentation,
we would like to know when and in which cell the cancer mutation first occurred in each patient, how the
population of mutated HSCs expanded, and to what extent the differentiation trajectory of the cancer cells
deviates from that of the healthy cells. Here, we propose a comprehensive research program to make these
measurements in individual MPN patients. To understand the difference between the cancer cells and the
healthy cells in each patient, we will profile each cell individually. Bulk measurements average over the cancer
cells and healthy cells, and obscure different cell states along the differentiation trajectory. We have recently
developed a technology platform to simultaneously read out the full transcriptome and the cancer mutation in
single cells. We will apply this platform to cells obtained from bone marrow biopsies of MPN patients. To obtain
the history of the expansion of the cancer stem cells in each patient, we will reconstruct the lineage tree of the
HSCs by sequencing the somatic mutations in the whole genomes of individual HSCs. Somatic mutations occur
randomly at each cell division and are passed on to a cell’s descendants. Critically, we will also trace the
differentiation trajectories of the progenies of each HSC by identifying the somatic mutations that uniquely mark
each HSC in our single-cell transcriptomic data. Taken together, these measurements will provide the most
detailed molecular picture of MPN at a single-cell resolution and the most comprehensive molecular history of
cancer progression in individual patients. Finally, to identify and test potential therapies for MPN, we will engineer
animal models whereby lineage histories of individual cells can be obtained without whole genome sequencing.
We will engineer a mouse model of MPN in which individual cells record their lineage histories in their own DNA
by using Cas9 to induce heritable mutations in synthetic target arrays that are transcribed and read out using
sequencing. Our proposal will answer some of the most outstanding and fundamental questions about MPNs
and blood development. Ultimately, our measurements should reveal patient-specific targeted therapies that
preferentially eradicate the cancer stem cells or hinder their differentiation."

The smoke-free home intervention study aims to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco use and exposure
by increasing access to smoke-free homes and cessation resources among racially/ethnically- and
linguistically-diverse populations in federally subsidized housing (“subsidized housing”). Black/African
American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian populations with limited English proficiency are over-represented in
subsidized housing; these populations have higher rates of tobacco use and exposure than the general
population. Tobacco-related cancer and cardiovascular disease contribute disproportionately to the excess
morbidity and mortality in these populations. Comprehensive smoke-free policies have the potential to
substantially reduce tobacco-related disparities among populations in subsidized housing. In 2018, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development implemented a smoke-free policy in a minority of public
housing, presenting a unique opportunity to expand the reach of such policies to all types of subsidized
housing. This study fills this gap by identifying approaches to increase the implementation of smoke-free
policies in all types of subsidized housing by increasing the voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes and
promoting access to smoking cessation services. We will build on our pilot work, where we developed and
evaluated the feasibility of a smoke-free home intervention to increase voluntary adoption of smoke-free
homes in permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless adults. We adapted our previously-developed
smoke-free home intervention to federally subsidized housing by incorporating new intervention components
that align with racially-ethnically and linguistically-diverse populations in three geographically-diverse California
Counties. The multi-faceted intervention, delivered by bilingual study staff in Chinese (Mandarin and
Cantonese), English, or Spanish includes: 1) one-on-one counseling to residents who are smokers on how to
adopt a smoke-free home, and 2) training housing staff as lay health workers to deliver monthly brief cessation
coaching to residents. We propose to conduct a wait-list cluster randomized controlled trial of the adapted
smoke-free home intervention compared to usual care among N=544 residents from 24 subsidized housing
sites in Contra Costa, Oakland and San Francisco. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To estimate the effect of our
adapted smoke-free home intervention on the primary outcome of residents' voluntary adoption of smoke-free
homes and the secondary outcome of biochemically-verified tobacco abstinence at 6-months follow-up. Aim 2:
To determine the cost of our adapted smoke-free home intervention and determine whether it is a cost-
effective use of health care resources. Aim 3: To evaluate variation in stakeholders’ perspectives on the
adapted smoke-free home intervention’s adaptability, scalability and sustainability. The proposed intervention
can expand access to smoke-free policies and smoking cessation services in subsidized housing, thereby
reducing racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco use, tobacco exposure and chronic disease in these populations."
10767995,"Project Summary:
Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunits (G6PCs) hydrolyze glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and
inorganic phosphate. G6PC2 is predominantly expressed in pancreatic islet b cells. Genetic and molecular
studies have linked increased G6PC2 activity to elevated FBG. Higher FBG in the non-diabetic and pre-diabetic
ranges strongly influence the risk of cardiovascular-associated mortality (CAM) and developing type 2
diabetes (T2D) whereas, in individuals with T2D, elevated FBG increases the risk for diabetic complications
and further increases the risk of CAM. These observations strongly suggest that G6PC2 inhibitors may
represent a potential novel therapy to reduce FBG. We hypothesize that the proposed genetic, metabolic,
physiological and biochemical studies will define the functions of G6PC2 in b cells, demonstrate that G6PC2 represents a
viable target for lowering FBG and generate data that fosters the development of G6PC2 inhibitors. Our data suggest a
new paradigm in which a glucokinase/G6PC2 futile substrate cycle, rather than glucokinase alone, is the key
determinant of glycolytic flux in b cells. Consequently, deletion of G6pc2 increases the sensitivity of glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) to glucose, which results in reduced FBG. We have developed novel assays
for measuring G6PC2 activity in vitro and in intact cells. In Aim 1 we propose using these assays to identify
non-synonymous G6PC2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that impair G6PC2 activity and then
explore their effects on human health using Vanderbilt’s BioVU biobank. We will also explore the concept,
arising from preliminary data, that G6PC2 regulates metabolic fluxes and pulsatile insulin secretion in b cells
through a mechanism independent of the known action of G6PC2 on glycolysis, that involves altered ER
calcium oscillations. We hypothesize the results of Aim 1 will define the functions of G6PC2 in b cells and highlight the
positive as well as potential negative effects of G6PC2 inhibition in humans. The conspicuous absence of structure-
function studies on G6PC2 originated from the absence of a high-resolution molecular model, the low inherent
activity of the enzyme and an inability to purify active G6PC2. The groundbreaking publication of the
AlphaFold2 algorithm for protein structure prediction, and our development of heterologous expression and
purification protocols for isolation of stable and catalytically active G6PC2, have overcome these hurdles. In
Aim 2, we will use mutagenesis to probe the functional importance of amino acids within various putative
domains in G6PC2 and then leverage a toolkit of biochemical/biophysical assays to define their effects on
G6PC2 folding, stability and catalysis. We will also perform studies to characterize the specificity of a human
G6PC2 inhibitor and explore its ability to regulate GSIS in human islets. We hypothesize the results of Aim 2 will
establish a new paradigm for investigation of G6PC2 by providing a molecular blueprint for understanding the structural
basis of catalysis as well as generating data that will provide insight into the mode of action of a known G6PC2 inhibitor,
which will inform the rational design of optimized compounds."
10757442,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined as a breast cancer (BC) subtype lack of estrogen
receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression and HER2 amplification/overexpression. It
represents a significant clinical challenge because the patients with TNBC have a poor prognosis and
account for a disproportionate number of BC deaths. Although targeted therapies, including PARP inhibitors
and a Trop-2-directed antibody (Ab)-drug conjugate as well as immunotherapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Abs) have
been approved to treat advanced/metastatic TNBC, chemotherapy currently remains the mainstay for a large
part of TNBC patients and initially effective. However, drug resistance and tumor recurrence frequently occur,
suggesting that TNBC is highly heterogenerous and it is in urgent need to develop more effective molecular-
based therapies for this aggressive disease. We recently discovered an elevated expression of HER3 (or
erbB3) in about half of the TNBC clinical samples and cell lines examined. Bioimformatics analyses of TCGA
datasets revealed that high erbB3 expression significantly associated with poorer outcomes in TNBC
patients, especially those with the subtypes of Basal-like 1 (BL1), Luminal-Androgen receptor (LAR), or
Basal-like 2 (BL2). We then identified PHF8 (PHD finger protein 8, or KDM7B, a histone lysine demethylase)
as one of the most downregulated epigenetic modifiers upon silencing of erbB3 in a BL2-TNBC cell line. The
positive correlation of erbB3 and PHF8 was further supported via analysis of BC clinical samples and cell
lines. Moreover, studies with gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches indicated that PHF8 played a
crucial role in HER3-mediated promotion of BL1/2-TNBC cell growth, migration, and invasion. Thus, we
hypothesize that PHF8 functions as a key downstream mediator of HER3 signaling in BL1/2-TNBC
progression and metastasis; and inhibition of HER3 or PHF8 will significantly enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapy against TNBC. We intend to define the molecular basis of HER3 signaling-mediated
upregulation of PHF8 in TNBC and subsequent tumor progression and metastasis, and to determine the
therapeutic potential of inactivation of HER3 or PHF8 in combination with chemotherapy against TNBC.

Early life stress (ELS) is defined as stressful and traumatic events, such as household dysfunction, neglect,
sexual or physical abuse, economic hardship, and exposure to violence, experienced up to 18 years. ELS was
identified as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor over 20 years ago, but mechanistic insights into its effects
remain very limited. Exposure to ELS is pervasive in the US with ~50% of children and adolescents having one
or more major ELS experiences. ELS exposure increases the risk traditional CVD risk factors - by the 3rd-4th
decade of life. A recent analysis of healthcare burden in Europe and North America attributed $748 billion in
annual costs to the effects of ELS, with 75% of those costs in people with multiple ELS exposures. The
significance of our work aligns with the NHLBI mission to promote the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
diseases enhancing the health of all individuals to live longer and fulfilling lives. Among individuals with a history
of ELS exposure, vascular dysfunction (elevated peripheral vascular resistance, increased vascular stiffness)
and elevated diastolic blood pressure are already evident in early adulthood. The overall goal of our program
project grant (PPG) is to define mechanisms by which ELS leads to CVD risk and inform strategies for prevention
and effective treatment of CVD consequences in individuals exposed to ELS. This PPG will address two critical
barriers to fulfill our goal: 1) Need for ELS-specific in-depth mechanistic and translational studies; and, 2) Identify
modifiable protective factors that can reduce ELS-induced CVD risk. The overarching hypothesis of our PPG is
that ELS induces immune cell activation leading to vascular dysfunction with increased hypertension risk and
CVD risk that are exacerbated by later life stressors or moderated by resilience/protective factors. This PPG with
both basic science and clinical projects utilizes a synergistic and integrative approach translating concepts from
clinically relevant rodent models to humans. Our group is extremely synergistic, with each leader bringing unique
expertise from different scientific backgrounds focused on our overall goal to understand mechanisms of ELS
induced indicators of CVD risk and resilience. Over the past several years, our team built strong collaborations
translating discoveries between basic and clinical labs with several pilot grants, co-mentoring trainees, and
multiple jointly authored abstracts, manuscripts, and publications. The four projects and three cores are
integrated in their goals and impact such that much more will be achieved together than separately. This PPG
utilizes a range of approaches to investigate in-depth molecular mechanisms of ELS-induced hypertension and
vascular disease risk as well as to delineate protective factors mediating resiliency to this risk. The results will
have important translational potential pointing to new intervention or prevention strategies for the health
consequences of CVD and reducing the healthcare burden of CVD."

Healthcare professionals, genomic scientists, and numerous other stakeholders are embracing the advances in
healthcare that are possible, and with increasing frequency are being delivered, through approaches that
employ genomics to improve care and patient outcomes. To ensure that we can continue to expand upon and
deliver the full potential of such an approach requires a highly qualified cadre of clinician-scientists, scientists,
and clinicians working collaboratively to advance discoveries and implementation in genomic medicine. This
proposal for continuation of our post-doctoral genomic medicine training program, “Program for Applied
Research and Development in Genomic Medicine or PARADIGM,” leverages our successes and lessons
learned from the first cycle of funding to: 1) refine an integrated training program in genomic medicine, which
includes didactic, research, clinical, and professional development activities; 2) recruit promising junior
investigators and train them using an interprofessional and interdisciplinary mentoring approach; and 3)
evaluate the PARADIGM training program for achievement of learning objectives, success, and long-term
productivity and career progress of trainees. This training program for MDs, PharmDs, PhDs, and other clinical
specialists at the doctoral level is based on four premises: 1) Genomic medicine must be advanced by a cadre
of clinicians and PhD scientists from a variety of specialty areas; 2) a team approach is essential; 3) genomic
medicine will require a diverse workforce of leaders; 4) the University of Florida is an ideal environment for this
training. To train individuals to meet these needs, PARADIGM will provide a multi-year, integrated,
multidisciplinary program comprised of four major components: 1) a Didactic component of required and
optional coursework; 2) a Mentored Research component involving a defined research project under the
mentorship of an accomplished genomic medicine scientist and clinician; 3) a Clinical Genomic Medicine
component that integrates trainees into the genomic medicine clinical practice setting; and 4) a Professional
Development component including training in research integrity; administrative, fiscal and regulatory training;
and grant-writing skills. Training across these four components will be tailored to the experience and needs of
each trainee, but will be concentrated in three cores of expertise at UF: pharmacogenomics, cancer genomics,
and disease susceptibility genetics/genomics. The program will be led by two highly accomplished leaders in
the field together with a cadre of highly talented, collaborative, multidisciplinary mentors. PARADIGM will
undergo continuous evaluation and quality improvement to ensure long-term success of the trainees. Upon
program completion, each trainee will be expected to possess knowledge and skills that will enable them to
manage the challenges of evidence generation and clinical use of genomic medicine."
10868547,"Mental disorders are among the leading causes of disability in the world, and improved strategies
to reduce their burden are needed. Epidemiologic studies of psychiatric disorders now include not
only important quantification of prevalence and incidence, but also sophisticated measures of
phenotype, high-throughput -omics assays, etiologic inquiry, and broad prevention interventions.
Neuroscience, via increasingly accessible imaging modalities collected in large numbers of study
participants, has only begun to inform public health. In tandem, long-term health impacts of mental
disorders, including suicide, have continued to increase in prevalence despite best efforts at
prevention and mitigation. The goal of the Psychiatric Epidemiology Training (PET) program at the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is to produce the next generation of psychiatric
epidemiologists who can address these needs by conducting research that will advance our
understanding of the causes and consequences of mental disorders, and developing,
implementing, and evaluating rationally designed interventions to prevent and/or control these
disorders. It will achieve this through a rigorous program of coursework, research apprenticeships,
and integrative activities that provide trainees with a solid foundation in the core proficiencies of
psychiatric epidemiology while giving them the opportunity to pursue specialized training in one of
two Concentrations: Etiology of Mental Disorders and Interventions in Mental Disorders. The
program will include 6 predoctoral fellows who are supported by an experienced group of 24 Core
and 12 Affiliate Faculty who are aligned with one of the two Concentrations. PET program trainees
will be prepared to assume leadership positions in mental health research as faculty in Schools of
Public Health or Medicine, in government positions formulating research priorities and mental
health policy, in private industry conducting applied research, or in non-profit mental health
agencies or non-governmental organizations advocating for those with mental disorders. The PET
program has successfully trained psychiatric epidemiologists for over 4 decades. Drs. Volk and
Zandi will continue to lead the program and build on the successes of the last cycle to train the
next generation of leaders in psychiatric epidemiology. They are poised to continue building on the
rich tradition of the program and lead it in new directions that will produce leaders in psychiatric
epidemiology who will advance the field and drive research that focuses on etiologic mechanisms
and targeted interventions."

This application seeks to renew the NIH T32 Training in Basic and Translational Digestive Sciences that is
currently in its 10th year. The University of Michigan has a superb history of training in gastrointestinal
sciences over the last several decades, including both physician and non-physician scientists. In 2012 we
initiated a training program that focused on training postdoctoral clinical fellows (MD, MD/PhD) together with
predoctoral PhD candidate scientists interested in basic and translational digestive sciences. The Training
Program includes 26 NIH-funded faculty mentors, including 12 clinically active physician scientists and 14 non-
clinical faculty members, who come from clinical and basic science departments: Internal Medicine (13),
Molecular & Integrative Physiology (6), Pathology (3), Microbiology & Immunology (3), and Surgery (1). Our
program consolidates the major investigators who are conducting gastrointestinal basic and translational
research at the University of Michigan Medical School into a strong core of mentors for the training of physician
scientists and biomedical investigators interested in a research career in gastrointestinal science. Our group of
26 training program faculty are also members of the Michigan Digestive Diseases Core Center funded by NIH
(P30 DK34933) since 1986 and bring a long history of collaboration and team science. Our T32 training
program focuses on three thematic areas that provide exceptional cross-disciplinary collaboration amongst the
participating faculty: 1) mechanisms of cell fate, plasticity, regeneration, and transformation; 2) systemic,
cellular, and nutrient metabolism; 3) immune and inflammatory responses to host-environment-microbial
interactions. Continued support is requested for 3 predoctoral trainees seeking PhDs in one of a number of
disciplines that range from Physiology, Microbiology & Immunology, to Cell & Molecular Biology, and for 2
postdoctoral Gastroenterology Fellow trainees. The Program, co-directed by Chung Owyang, MD (Division of
Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine) and Linda Samuelson, PhD (Department of Molecular &
Integrative Physiology), includes a weekly seminar series in GI science (both internal and external speakers),
trainee research presentations, training in responsible conduct of research and research reproducibility, and
strong mentoring and career development guidance. Trainee research will be supported by more than $20
million of annual research funding awarded to the training faculty combined with substantial institutional
support to directly support the trainees and the Program. The combined mass and diversity of available
resources, our past training record, and the demonstrated excellence of the training faculty provide strong
evidence that this program will continue to be highly successful in training the next generation of investigators
interested in basic and translational digestive sciences."
10764700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Resource
The mouse has long served the scientific community as the mammalian model of choice for the study of
human disease. Decades of work used mice to great success in the study of single gene mutations to
better understand human biology and monogenic disorders. This compendium of work greatly advanced
our understanding of gene function, but it was also long recognized that the genetics of human health
was more complex than could be revealed by studying single genes in isolation. Fortunately, specialized
mouse strains were developed to begin to dissect more complex genetics and as the “omics” age
emerged the mouse was developed into an even more powerful model for the study of genetics at the
“systems” level. Strains have been developed, and more are under development, which have “human-
like” genetic diversity. These strains, and their predecessors, provide an experimental avenue to
modeling genetic complexity with an accuracy and confidence that allow findings to be translated to the
clinic more rapidly.
Over the years, a number of valuable resources have been created to study complex genetics. These
resources range from inbred strains, hybrid mapping panels, classic Recombinant Inbred (RI) lines, and
Chromosome Substitution (CS) strains, all the way to more recent strains such as the highly diverse
Collaborative Cross (CC) and Diversity Outbred (DO) populations. The utility of these special mouse
strains is entirely dependent upon getting consistently high-quality mice into the hands of researchers
around the world.
The Special Mouse Strains Resource (SMSR) at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) has provided reliable, efficient
access to these specialized strain panels for the scientific community and ensured their perpetuation though
cryopreservation. The SMSR is unique in its ability to provide high health status facilities with streamlined
order management and short delivery times. As importantly, the SMSR continues, to work closely with the
complex trait community to evolve its resources and to provide access to large-scale mouse breeding and
housing capacity to support collaborative research projects.
The SMSR will continue to provide this high-quality resource through the following aims: Aim 1 - SMSR will
actively distribute as well as archive specialized mouse strains and related resources for complex trait analysis.
Aim 2 - SMSR will maintain complete and accessible strain information and informatics resources for SMSR
strains. Aim 3 - SMSR will evaluate new and existing resource needs."
10764704,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Applied Research
 The genetics underlying human biology and disease is complex and will require the use of “system genetics”
to dissect the myriad of interactions that control and regulate biological processes. Tools for human studies
have advanced greatly yet there remains a necessary reliance on mammalian models. To this end new strains
of mice have been created that better emulate the extent of human genetic variation. These strains include
Collaborative Cross (CC), Diversity Outbred (DO) and recombinant inbred mice (e.g. BXD). The CC/DO and
BXD platforms harness the natural inbred strain variation needed for systems genetics studies. However, the
use of these strains typically requires additional genetic engineering of the mice to create “tool strains” to allow
specific types of genetic manipulations. Such strains already exist for standard inbred strains (e.g. C57BL/6J),
but “tool strains”, that carry commonly needed genetic manipulations, are not presently available for genetically
diverse inbred strains such as CC/DO, BXD, or all of the founder inbred strains used to create these RI panels.
 The use of the powerful CC/DO/BXD strains is growing rapidly and to facilitate efficient use of these mice we
propose to create a series of tool strains and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). To do this, we will take
advantage of diverse inbred strains that harbor novel, high efficiency recombinase-based docking sites to
facilitate the use of CRISPR-cas9 editing for creation of the new strains. Validated new tool strains will be
made available through the Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR).
 To achieve this goal we will:
 Derive and validate germ line competent mESC lines from existing Bxb1 integrase strains. The goal
here is to create a panel of genetically diverse mESC lines harboring Bxb1 integrase sites, as well as LSL-
Cas9-FLAG. These mESCs will provide tools for engineering loci that are difficult to engineer in zygotes or for
validation experiments that can be accomplished in vitro.
 Generate Rosa26-LSL-Cas9-FLAG tool strains for CAST/EiJ, PWK/EiJ, and DBA/2J inbred strains.
These strains will enable CRISPR/cas9 editing in the absence of exogenous Cas9. This facilitates engineering
in zygotes and allows for easy, precise engineering of somatic cells/tissues. The goal is to create and validate
this important tool strain for the three high priority inbred strain backgrounds listed above.
 Generate germ line deletion tool strains for CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ inbred strain backgrounds.
Removal of specific DNA sequences or engineering stop codons is frequently accomplished using flanking
loxP sites that serve as catalytic domains for cre recombinase. Implementation of this approach frequently
uses “germ line cre” strains, that are not currently available on genetically diverse strain backgrounds. Thus,
the goal here is to take advantage of our Bxb1 docking site strains to create Rosa26 Sox2-cre knock-in alleles
on CAST/EiJ and PWK/EiJ."
10577199,"Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability, with more than 795,000 people having a stroke in the United States each year. Stroke survivors often experience loss of motor control and impaired function. Immediately after stroke, there is a time-limited window of heightened plasticity during which the greatest gains in recovery occur. Therefore, early intensive sensorimotor rehabilitation post-stroke is critical in improving functional outcomes and minimizing disability. As recommended in a national guideline, “rehabilitation therapy should start as early as possible, once medical stability is reached”. However, acute stroke survivors often receive little active training to improve mobility during their hospital stay and they are left alone during most of the day. Especially for those acute patients with no voluntary motor output (Manual muscle testing MMT=0), active motor training might be even less, partly due to a lack of rehabilitation protocols to detect potential motor recovering signals sensitively and facilitate neuroplastic changes. Although a number of rehabilitation devices have been developed for stroke rehabilitation, few of them is suitable for the critical period of early in-bed rehabilitation, especially for patients with MMT=0, to provide timely motor-sensory training during the critical time window early post stroke.  To address this unmet clinical need, the proposed project will develop a novel wearable rehabilitation robot suitable for in-bed acute stage rehabilitation with guided motor relearning, passive and active motor-sensory rehabilitation early in the acute stage post-stroke including patients who are paralyzed with no motor output. We propose to develop the early acute stroke rehabilitation device suitable for severe motor impairment and evaluate the device through a clinical trial to conduct intensive daily motor-sensory rehabilitation on patients with acute stroke including those with MMT=0 or 1 during the earliest feasible periods (>24 hours after admission) and throughout their hospital stay, using a wearable rehabilitation robot. The long-term goals are to intervene early and facilitate sensorimotor recovery, reduce lower limb impairments, and improve balance and locomotion.  In Phase I of the study, we will improve the hardware and software of a prototype wearable rehabilitation robot and make it suitable for in-bed early intensive rehabilitation of acute stroke survivors with severe ankle motor impairment to carry out the training: 1) guided motor relearning training under real-time feedback; 2) intelligent stretching for sensory stimulation and stiffness reduction; 3) game-based active movement training under robotic assistance and demonstration; 4) repeat the guided motor relearning in 1).  A clinical trial will be conducted in Phase II on a study group receive the above 4-step training, while control group receives only passive ankle movement in the middle range of motion without stretching and active ankle movement without robotic assistance.  The proposed study seeks to provide a much needed early in-bed sensory-motor training protocol applicable to severe motor impairment using a rehabilitation robot to facilitate neuroplastic changes in the critical period of early post stroke, which will likely promote earlier and better recovery and improve functional outcomes."
10766754,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The plasma membrane-bound sodium-dependent citrate transporter (NaCT) plays a major role in fatty acid
biosynthesis and thus represents a major therapeutic target for various metabolic diseases. Its bacterial
homolog, VcINDY, is a prototype of the entire divalent anion sodium symporter (DASS) family, of which NaCT is
also a member. Despite the enormous progress that has been made, major gaps remain in our current
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NaCT, VcINDY, and other secondary membrane transporters. In
particular, we do not know how a transporter works in real-time. At best, mechanistic descriptions of the transport
cycles of these transporters consist of a series of structural snapshots of some of the individual states, along
with limited kinetic parameters connecting the various states obtained from ensemble measurements. In this
project, we aim to characterize the structure, dynamics, function, and inhibition of these two sodium-driven
carboxylate transporters. (1) We will first characterize the structural basis of sodium-substrate coupling in
VcINDY and NaCT. We will identify the ion stoichiometry and the positions and structures of the unknown sodium
sites in the transporters. Following measurements of sodium-dependent substrate binding in solution, we will
determine the structures of the transporters in the presence and absence of sodium using cryo-EM. Any
hypothesis suggested by such structures will be examined by biochemical experiments. (2) Using smFRET, we
will characterize the real-time dynamics with which VcINDY and NaCT transition between the outward- and
inward-facing states during transport. Specifically, we will identify the number of conformational states that are
sampled during transport and determine the rates of transitions between those states. Using this framework, we
will investigate how the sodium ions and substrates that generate the driving force for transport modulate these
parameters. These experimental measurements will be integrated into computational models generated by MD
simulations. (3) We will aim to understand the entire reaction cycle of the transporter, including the energy
landscape. We will develop FRET-based succinate and citrate sensors to measure the transport activities of
individual transporters in single liposomes. These measurements will be used to construct the entire free-energy
landscape of the transporter using MD simulations. (4) Finally, we will elucidate the mechanisms of inhibition of
NaCT by several classes of allosteric inhibitors from the pharmaceutical industry to improve their potency and
specificity in order to help design better strategies in the treatment of metabolic disorders."
10755336,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating condition with potentially
devastating effects on large numbers of cancer patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 650,000 patients are treated with chemotherapy every year in the United States, and between 30-
70% of these patients will develop symptoms of CIPN. Clinical research has demonstrated CIPN is a leading
cause of therapeutic non-compliance, reduced quality of life and poorer cancer survival rates. Patients who
develop symptomatic CIPN also have an associated $20,000 increase in overall treatment cost in comparison
to patients that do not develop symptoms and are also more like to suffer relapse of their cancer. Currently, there
are no established treatments for CIPN.
 We propose that 4-aminopyridine (4AP), principally a K+ channel inhibitor, is a promising candidate to
prevent and/or treat CIPN. Separate from the known abilities of 4AP to enable impulse conduction in axons with
myelin damage, 4AP has recently been used to treat acute peripheral nerve injuries with enhanced durable
functional recovery and repair of myelin damage. In more recent studies, treatment of acute skin wounds with
4AP enhances healing and regeneration of neural elements of skin. In addition, in its best studied applications,
4AP is used to provide symptomatic relief in a variety of neurological syndromes in which normal nerve cell
function is compromised. Restoring normal nerve function may also be relevant to decreasing neuropathic pain,
as seen in previous studies in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury.
 The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that 4AP can be used to prevent or decrease
caused by exposure to paclitaxel (PTX). Our experiments will test the independent sub-hypotheses that (i)
initiation of 4AP treatment prior to establishment of CIPN prevents its development without compromising the
effectiveness of PTX in treating a well-accepted syngeneic model of breast cancer in mice; and (ii) established
CIPN is responsive to 4AP as a means of decreasing neuropathic pain after CIPN is established.
 An established mouse model for PTX-induced CIPN will be used in these experiments. 4AP will be
studied both as a concurrent treatment with PTX to prevent CIPN development, and as a means of providing
symptomatic relief in established CIPN. Outcomes will evaluate the pressure sensitivity (allodynia), thermal
sensitivity, gait coordination, electrophysiology, muscle physiology, and histology focusing on the ultrastructural
changes."
10754592,"Abstract
Like skeletal muscle myofibers, cardiomyocytes in the heart constantly adjust their size based on
perceived workload or disease stimulation, in which hypertrophic versus atrophic pathways are in
balance to achieve an appropriate equilibrium matched to real-time workloads. In a less
appreciated process, both heart and skeletal muscle can reduce size through molecular
regulatory pathways that cause tissue catabolism. This reduction in size is referred to as atrophy
and this process can underlie tissue remodeling and responses to disease stimulation or loss of
sufficient nutrients (such as starvation) in which both tissues can serve as metabolic reservoirs.
Here we uncovered a novel function for thrombospondin1 as a regulator of both cardiac and
skeletal muscle atrophy. We have previously shown that the thrombospondin gene family (Thbs1-
5) plays a critical role in membrane stability through effects on the ER stress response and
secretory pathways, as well as controlling the integrin and dystrophin-glycoprotein complexes
present with the sarcolemma. However, more recently we have discovered that Thbs1 is uniquely
induced by disease stimuli associated with cardiac remodeling and caloric restriction, and that
Thbs1 uniquely regulates cellular atrophy and autophagy through an intracellular pathway within
the ER/SR that functions at 2 levels. 1) Thbs1 directly binds and regulates the ER stress factor
PERK and eIF2α to mediate cardiomyocyte atrophy through the transcription factor ATF4, and 2)
Thbs1 selectively expands lysosomes and the vesicular pathway of autophagy. Hence, we
hypothesize that Thbs1 is an ER-dependent chaperone that mediates cardiomyocyte size
reduction, in part, by driving the catabolic process through autophagy. To investigate this
hypothesis, we will interrogate 2 specific aims: 1) To examine the mechanisms of cardiac atrophy
and autophagy through PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 signaling mediated by Thbs1 within the ER
compartment. 2) To examine a mechanism whereby cardiac autophagy is mediated by Thbs1-
dependent formation of lysosomes and associated catabolic vesicular activity. The proposed
course of investigation will be conducted in both cultured cardiomyocytes and in genetically
modified mouse models so that both reductionist and mechanistic approaches can be taken, as
well as in vivo assessment in a physiologically relevant context. The proposed application is
innovative as it will define for the first time what appears to be a novel cell biology pathway through
Thbs1 that controls striated muscle remodeling through atrophy and autophagy."
10805405,"To achieve a healthy society, America needs both highly trained health professionals and a science-literate
public. The development of both begins during K-12 education. Within the NIH, the SEPA program provides
the principal means to influence pre-college science education. Our application builds on current infrastructure,
which provides ca. 1700 high school students per year, many of them from underrepresented groups, with
authentic scientific experiences based on experiment modules that utilize live organisms as biomedical models.
Students investigate the impacts of environmental/life-style chemicals on fundamental biological processes. In
the process, ca. 20 pre-service teachers per year learn to teach with an inquiry-based approach. Moving forward,
the proposed SEPA program will i) engage in-service and pre-service teachers and students with an in-depth
introduction to the scientific method and its components that is closely linked to the conduct of the experiment
modules. A major focus will involve analytical applications of data science that emerge after aggregating large
amounts of data submitted by students to a computational portal and data repository. Complementing this novel
emphasis, ii) student experimentation will be placed within a context of science and society, called environmental
health civics – a history of environmental chemicals in relation to governmental regulation and chemical toxicity
research. Attention will be directed toward environmental justice, particularly issues which effect Milwaukee
youth, including lead (Pb) poisoning, through the use of a powerful on-line environmental health mapping
program from the EPA. Experiment modules and special student conferences will further develop this area.
Both i) and ii) will be fully aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards. In addition, we will iii) provide
new ways for early career teachers to implement our program as they transition from pre-service status to mature
in-service teachers. Finally, iv) we will transfer our program to an on-line format and partner with other
institutions to expand the reach of our pre-service teacher program. Content goals will be merged with our
objective to offer large numbers of minority and economically disadvantaged students research experiences with
our modules. Our Specific Aims are to 1. Introduce in-service and early career teachers to the principles of
data and data science in relation to our environmental health experiment modules. 2. Collaborate with the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, UW-Stevens Point and Carthage College science teacher education
programs to certify 100 pre-service teachers in the principles and practice of scientific experimentation and
communication. 3. Provide 8,500 high school students with a) experiences in doing data and data science-
focused scientific research, and b) an understanding of the importance of chemical toxicology, including a focus
on environmental justice. 4. Work with the Milwaukee Public School System and other regional schools to
provide large numbers of low income and underrepresented minority students with research experiences. 5.
Develop a robust on-line version of our program. 6. Conduct a thorough evaluation of the entire project."
10809055,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global HIV/AIDS pandemic, shifts in drug use patterns, and advances in intervention research designs, all create new
ethical challenges for studies at the intersection of HIV and drug abuse. To date, there is a paucity of well-qualified
investigators trained to conduct scientifically rigorous studies to inform policies directed at meeting these challenges. The
goal of this renewal is to advance the contributions of the Fordham University HIV and Drug Abuse Prevention Research
Ethics Training Institute (RETI), the only program of its kind, to meet this need. The broad long-term objectives of the
RETI are to train a new generation of scientists who will conduct robust and unbiased designs to inform research ethics
practices sensitive to the unique needs of individuals with and at-risk for HIV and substance abuse and to extend the
program's global impact through online scientific and pedagogical resources. These objectives are met through the
following aims. Aim 1: To increase early career clinical scientists' capacity to conduct rigorous and reproducible
empirical research on HIV and drug abuse prevention research ethics practices and policies. Ethical decisions by
investigators and IRBs/RECs are often guided by subjective interpretations of broadly worded regulations and guidelines.
Empirical data on ethics practices and policies is thus needed to better inform these decisions. Aim 1 will address this
need through the RETI mentored research project (MRP), a multi-year funded research experience in which trainees
receive intensive supervised experience designing, implementing, analyzing and disseminating an original study on HIV
and drug abuse research ethics. The MRP will be conducted in conjunction with the annual RETI Summer Institute that
will build trainee competencies in the unique conceptual frameworks and research designs for conducting studies on
research ethics. Aim 1 will also be achieved through career development activities designed to enhance publication and
grant writing skills and to disseminate trainees' work through a new public webinar series. Aim 2: To increase early
career clinical scientists' capacity to engage communities in the construction of HIV and drug abuse participant
protections. Although community advisory boards (CABs) are now commonplace in HIV and drug abuse research, few
programs teach trainees how to involve appropriate stakeholders in the development of the study design and the
procedures to protect participant rights and welfare. This has often led to limited empowerment of prospective participants
as collaborative partners. Aim 2 will be achieved through Summer Institute seminars on methods to engage prospective
participants in ethics-relevant dialogue and inclusion of community advisory boards at the design and interpretation stages
of the mentored research project. Aim 3: To create and sustain a global information network for enhancing ethical
knowledge and evidence-based ethics practices, policies and pedagogy for HIV and drug abuse prevention research ethics.
Aim 3 will be achieved through expansion of RETI's global online HIV and drug abuse research ethics scientific and
pedagogical resources. As a new feature, the RETI will promote transformative partnerships between investigators and
communities by creating Community Access to Research Ethics (CARE), a social media platform specifically tailored to
bring research ethics science to communities and populations represented in HIV and drug abuse research."
10763425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Morphea is a disfiguring autoimmune disease of the skin and underlying tissue. An unbalanced inflammatory
response leads to fibrosis and atrophy of the deeper tissue, causing physical and psychological disability.
Available therapies for morphea are not always efficacious and are often associated with substantial side
effects. One of the biggest barriers to the development of new treatments is a lack of studies examining the
pathophysiology of morphea, the initial step that leads toward the development of more directed and
efficacious therapies. The Morphea in Adults and Children (MAC) and National Registry for Childhood Onset
Scleroderma (NRCOS) registries, led by the principal investigators (Jacobe and Torok, respectively), have
already begun to address this problem. Working together, we have investigated the protein expression and
bulk transcriptional profile associated with morphea in both children and adults using protein assay, cytometry,
and microarray/RNA sequencing. These data indicate that fibrosis in morphea is driven by inflammation
through a network of IFN-γ mediated genes. Despite this progress, the pathogenesis of morphea, including the
exact cell populations’ producing this IFN-γ over expression, needs to be examined in depth before new
treatments can be tested. That is the goal of this proposal.
Our studies will leverage both the unique resources of the MAC and NRCOS registries (the largest in the
world), which are supported by a Parent Observational Cohort study grant (NIAMS R01), and the
multidisciplinary and complementary expertise of the investigators (including facilities at UTSW Medical Center
and the University of Pittsburgh) to conduct detailed transcriptional and mechanistic studies to fully investigate
transcriptional profiles of likely pathogenic cell types and study the immunological effects of key molecules in
fibroblast cultures and co-culture systems. The objectives of the proposed studies are to: 1) further define
dysregulated immune pathways in morphea via transcriptomic analyses, 2) determine the association of these
gene signatures to validated clinical measures and disease course to evaluate their role as biomarkers in
morphea, 3) identifying inflammatory cell subsets that express these IFN-γ mediated genes, which are likely
the pathogenic cell subtypes, 4) determine fibroblast subsets and their interaction with pathogenic
inflammatory cells, 5) and define the pathogenic pathways that enable the disease, by first utilizing human
fibroblast cultures. The conduct of these studies will not only probe morphea to find the underlying disease
mechanism, but will also produce promising targets for development of biomarkers and new therapies."
10756568,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In recent years, FDA has approved a growing number of drugs that are covalently linked to target biological
molecules. To expand the development of covalent inhibitors, technologies more specific to the discovery of
such inhibitors are needed. It is also necessary to address concerns regarding off-site reactivity and toxicity
associated with covalent drugs. The particular focus of this proposal is to develop multiscale in silico covalent
docking approaches by integrating robust quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potentials
with the EnzyDock docking platform, thus enabling explicit modeling of multi-step chemical events and their
energetic contributions during the search for docked poses. Current docking approaches lack the ability to
perform covalent bond formation in a manner consistent with an inhibitor’s pre-covalent binding mode, as well
as with the reaction transition state and covalently bonded mode. This wanting ability not only hampers the
fundamental understanding of warhead-target reactivity, but also poses a technical barrier for advancing in silico
docking strategies. Indeed, many existing docking programs offer the capacity to perform covalent docking but
in an ad hoc fashion, as covalent docking was not considered from the design phase of the program development.
With the goal to overcome this technical challenge, two specific aims are: AIM 1 is to develop a multiscale
QM/MM/EnzyDock covalent docking method. In this development, EnzyDock will serve as the primary docking
platform and robust semiempirical QM/MM potentials will be developed, calibrated for each specific warhead-
target reaction type and combined with EnzyDock. In addition, we will develop and implement the generalized
Born (GB) solvation model with the QM/MM potential framework to improve the energetics of QM/MM-docked
poses. AIM 2 will apply the QM/MM/EnzyDock approach developed in AIM 1 to establish effective workflow for
in silico screening of large covalent inhibitor databases. Specifically, two workflows will be explored: The first
workflow is based on docking with a predefined covalent attachment site, which is employed in most covalent
docking programs. The second workflow entails a dynamic approach to covalent docking, in which covalent
attachment sites on the ligand are searched and determined on the fly during docking using cheminformatics
analysis and spatial proximity with target residues in the binding pocket. In this research, the study will be limited
to the warheads that react only with cysteine residues, while additional target residues, reaction types and
warheads will be considered in future research to construct a more comprehensive warhead-target reaction
database. Thus, the two workflows will be tested and benchmarked against known structures and
kinetic/thermodynamic data of drug-Cys covalent systems. We expect that the methods developed in this project
will make the in silico covalent inhibitor discovery more powerful and help understand electrophilic-target
reactivity for use in warhead design and selection."
10775791,"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the follicular lymphoma (FL) are the most common lymphoid
malignancy in adults. EZH2 mutant occurs in DLBCL and FL patients. Immunotherapies, EZH2 inhibitor and CAR
T cells are FDA approved for FL and DLBCL, respectively. Understanding why patients respond or are resistant
to the immunotherapies is essential for these approaches to reach their full potential. However, it is unclear
whether the mechanism of EZH2i action is cell autonomous or through restoration of immune surveillance and
how EZH2i affects the ability of CAR T cells to kill lymphoma because there has not been visualized the process
of immune surveillance against lymphoma in vivo. In particular, the white pulps of mouse spleen, key regions of
lymphomagenesis, are challenging to visualize in vivo due to the limited imaging penetration depth of
conventional two-photon (2P) microscopy. Leveraging deep tissue imaging capability of three-photon (3P)
microscopy that provides twice deeper imaging depth than 2P microscopy, we aim to in vivo visualize the dynamic
interplay of lymphoma B cells with their microenvironments and CAR T cells in the spleen upon EZH2i treatment.
To this end, we propose the following specific aims: (1) develop simultaneous 6-color and longitudinal 3P
microscopy approach for intravital imaging of the white pulps in mouse spleen and (2) perform the intravital 3P
microscopy for understanding the impact of EZH2 inhibitors on reactivation of anti-lymphoma response and their
impact on enhancing CAR T cell therapy. In Aim 1, first of all, we will determine permissible laser parameters to
optimize the imaging speed for tracking individual immune cell migration in a mouse spleen because high
average power and pulse energy of laser excitation required for deep and fast imaging can cause thermal and
focal damages. Second, we will develop an implantable chronic imaging window for longitudinal imaging of
mouse spleen for several weeks to several months. Third, we will develop simultaneous 6-color 3P imaging
system to visualize the interaction among 6 different cell types by adding 2 more detection channels in the current
4-color 3P imaging system. In Aim 2, we will perform the simultaneous 6-color and longitudinal 3P microscopy
to visualize the dynamic interaction of lymphoma B cells with helper T cells, regulatory T cells, CD8 effector T
cells, follicular dendritic cells, and blood vessels in the spleen of syngeneic lymphoma mouse model upon EZH2i
or control vehicle treatment. In addition, we will also visualize the interplay of lymphoma B cells with CAR T cells
and the following apoptosis of the tumor cells upon EZH2i or vehicle treatment to understand how EZH2i affects
the ability of CAR T cell to kill the tumor cells. Collectively, this study will demonstrate 6-color and longitudinal
3P microscopy for intravital imaging of the splenic immune system with tumors, for the first time. The imaging
results will provide the first direct evidence for the nature of the anti-lymphoma immune response and the manner
in which lymphomas evade host immune cells and CART cells, allowing us to generate new hypotheses for the
design of combination immune therapies."
10755337,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are important urinary tract pathogens and the most common causes of
catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). CAUTIs are one of the most common health care-
associated infections and contribute to nearly double the mortality rate of catheterized compared to non-
catheterized patients. CAUTIs are frequently polymicrobial and inter-species interactions contribute to the
development of catheter biofilms and increase the risk of sepsis. Polymicrobial environments are shaped by both
cooperative and competitive interactions between species. However, specific interactions between different
urinary tract colonizers currently remain poorly defined. Characterizations of competitive interactions is
additionally hampered by the fact that a large number of competition systems remain undiscovered. Our overall
goal is to study the role of competition systems for successful colonization of Enterobacteriaceae in the urinary
tract. This proposal specifically aims to identify and further characterize a novel inter-species competition system
employed by Proteus mirabilis to kill competitor species. We showed that clinical and commensal P. mirabilis
strains quickly and drastically (2-million-fold) reduced viability of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae
during co-culture. Cell-free P. mirabilis culture supernatant alone did not reduce viability of target cells. Killing
instead required direct contact between cells. However, a heat-labile component in stationary phase P. mirabilis
supernatant was sufficient to induce killing, suggesting that the system is likely regulated via quorum sensing.
Killing also occurred on solid surfaces, where P. mirabilis was able to penetrate and kill all cells in established
microcolonies of E. coli. This highlights a potential role of the killing system in mixed biofilms, which is an
important component of urinary catheter colonization and persistence. The only known contact-dependent
competition system in P. mirabilis is the Type 6 Secretion System (T6SS), but a mutant deficient in this system
still killed E. coli. We thus hypothesize that P. mirabilis employs a novel contact-dependent system to kill E.
coli cells. The objective of this study is to identify the killing system and its regulation, define the mechanism of
action, and elucidate the role of the killing system for competition of P. mirabilis with E. coli during polymicrobial
infections in vivo. In Aim 1, we will use a transposon library of P. mirabilis and a bioluminescence-based assay
to screen for P. mirabilis mutants unable to kill E. coli and to identify genes coding for effector molecules, delivery
system and regulatory molecules of the killing system. We will also test the hypothesis that quorum sensing
molecules regulate the activity of the system and investigate the mechanism of how E. coli cells die after contact
with P. mirabilis. In Aim 2 we will assess the role of the P. mirabilis killing system during polymicrobial infection.
We will first test the ability of P. mirabilis to kill E. coli during biofilm formation on urinary catheters and then
assess colonization of catheters and dissemination to peripheral organs for P. mirabilis and E. coli in single and
polymicrobial infections using a CAUTI mouse model."

In addition to concentration, the orientation and conformation of proteins, carbohydrates, metabolites, and
nucleic acids are essential characteristics differentiating healthy and diseased states. In fact, broadly available
advances in mass spectrometry (MS), with unparalleled levels of selectivity, speed, and sensitivity, have armed
researchers with new biological insights and prompt additional questions regarding molecular and biophysical
parameters that differentiate disease states but transcend MS measurements. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)
is a gas-phase separation technique that directly complements MS measurements and expands understanding
regarding molecular shape and dynamics in biological systems. However, comparatively low sample utilization
and separation efficiencies have hindered its broad adoption in the bioanalytical and clinical communities. With
recent, broadly available technological advances in the field of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing a new
class of ion mobility separation is enabled that largely alleviates the drawbacks of its predecessors. The
Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM) framework achieves this goal by establishing a dynamic electric
field capable of confining ionized molecules for expanded periods of time along with a means to efficiently
fractionate the different classes prior to analysis using MS. Contemporary SLIM experiments achieve impressive
levels of gas-phase ion separation, but focus only on one dimension of separation due to restrictions largely
imposed by the underlying PCB electrode arrangements and control electronics. To cast the SLIM platform into
multiple separation dimensions and achieve new levels of biologically relevant diagnostics, the present effort
aims to develop and disseminate an economical tandem IMS platform that integrates a series of innovative,
simplifying strategies. These include the integration of a low-cost electrode switch that expands the experimental
versatility within the SLIM platform and a series of ion compression strategies aimed at creating high-density ion
populations. Most importantly, and prior to MS analysis, we will exploit the highly compressed nature of the ion
beams within the SLIM by subjecting these species to high intensity ultraviolet photons to induce molecular
disruption and yield more information regarding the target biological system. Concurrent efforts using laser
irradiation and a new class of UV-C light emitting diodes will be compared with the latter offering considerable
cost-savings. The third, composite goal of this project is to address the duty cycle issues of existing SLIM
concepts by fully multiplexing the tandem SLIM-ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) platform. With the added
functionality of IMSn and the extended, multi-channel SLIM paths, the separation power of the system is
anticipated to represent the state-of-the-art. At the conclusion of the proposed research we expect to realize a
fully functioning, high-efficiency SLIM-UVPD framework capable of interfacing to all mass analyzers classes and
ready to address a suite of biological problems ranging from metabolomics to structural biology."

Human telomeres are specialized chromatin structures uniquely programmed to coordinate cellular division with
genomic integrity, thus providing a senescence barrier to cancer-cell evolution. Telomere structural maintenance
and genome sensing functions require extensive epigenetic signaling and higher-order chromatin dynamics that
are poorly understood. Our previous studies have revealed the important roles of telomere encoded repeat RNA
(TERRA) in the coordinate regulation of telomere chromatin structure, DNA replication and repeat-length
maintenance. We have found that TERRA expression can be regulated by subtelomeric binding of chromatin
organizing factor CTCF and tumor suppressor protein p53 in response to DNA damage stress. TERRA is also
regulated by histone assembly factors DAXX and ATRX that are implicated in the Alternative Lengthening of
Telomeres (ALT) through recombination. New preliminary data indicates that DAXX and ATRX are also required
for p53 binding to subtelomeres in response to DNA damage, suggesting a coordinate regulation of these factors
in telomere chromatin control and TERRA expression. In Aim 1, we investigate the role of DAXX and ATRX in
regulating telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin accessibility that is critical for p53 binding, TERRA expression,
and telomere DNA repeat stability. TERRA is also known to interact with shelterin component TRF2. In Aim 2,
we propose to investigate the interaction of TERRA with the TRF2 amino terminal GAR domain, and how this
further regulates telomeric DNA replication, chromatin structure, and chromosome conformation. Finally, in Aim
3, we will investigate how TERRA and telomeric chromatin can be processed into vesicular bodies in response
to telomeric stress to generate extracellular inflammatory signals. We propose that exosomal TERRA and
telomeric chromatin serve as telomere-specific Alarmins that are important in cellular senescence and tumor
microenvironment signaling. These studies will provide an integrated analysis of telomere transcription and
chromatin regulation, with stress response pathways that are important in human cancer and related
inflammatory disease.
Central Hypothesis: Telomeres are specialized epigenetic elements that sense and signal replication stress to
control cell proliferative capacity and senescence. TERRA represents an important telomere-repeat generated
molecule that functions in chromatin structure, DNA replication and repair, and DNA damage signaling.
Characterization of normal and pathogenic functions of TERRA will provide important insight into the
mechanisms driving genetic instability in cancer and related genetic instability syndromes."
10773019,"CORE B – ORGANOID BIOBANK
PROJECT SUMMARY
Organoids are microscopic self-organizing, three-dimensional cellular structures that are grown from stem and
progenitor cells in vitro. These culture models recapitulate many structural and functional aspects of their in vivo
counterpart organs. This versatile technology has led to the development of many novel human cancer models,
which have been widely validated as having superior capabilities to conventional 2D cancer cell lines in
recapitulating human carcinoma biology. Over the last several years, several investigators at CSHL, including
members of the Program, have come together to establish a unique Organoid Biobank. Through a productive
collaboration with clinical oncologists, surgeons, and pathologists at several health centers, we have obtained
hundreds of fresh tumor specimens, which have been adapted as primary cultures as organoids. Rigorous
standard operating procedures annotated the genome and transcriptome of these cultures, resulting in the
classification of each tumor organoid into molecular subtypes. Importantly, this biobank includes numerous
basal-subtype models of pancreatic and breast carcinoma, which are a major focus of this Program. During the
next funding cycle, Core B will support all three Projects in the use of organoid models of cancer, which will
include a) establishing novel organoid models of basal-subtype breast and pancreatic cancer b) performing
genomic and transcriptomic characterization of these models c) assisting investigators in propagating organoid
cultures for various perturbation experiments d) assisting investigators in performing customized assays for
characterizing organoid morphology, migration, and lineage identity. Collectively, these valuable resources and
services will enable a deep investigation of transcriptional and splicing dependencies in cancer and allow for the
identification of biomarkers to predict therapeutic efficacy."
10744725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The inner-ear fluids, unlike other body fluids, are stationary and isolated from the rest of the body.
These characteristics give opportunities and challenges in maintaining inner-ear health and in treating inner-
ear diseases. Due to the blood-labyrinth barrier, systemic delivery of drugs to the inner ear is highly inefficient.
On the other hand, this isolation is an opportunity—drugs can be delivered locally with minimal off-target
concerns. Unfortunately, the potential advantage of local delivery has been difficult to capitalize on because of
the labyrinthine geometry of the inner ear. Application of drug at any location of the inner ear labyrinth filled
with stationary fluids results in high concentration at the application site without reaching distant locations. A
current remedy is to create surgical holes in the temporal bone to allow inner-ear fluids to flow despite the risk
of surgical damage. We propose minimally invasive and efficient drug delivery mechanism into the inner ear.
Specifically, we will develop a method to use sounds as the agitating source for cochlear drug delivery.
 Recent data regarding OoC micromechanics are both exciting and controversial because new
observations do not fit well into existing frameworks for cochlear biophysics. For example, the outer hair cells
are widely-acknowledged as the actuator for cochlear amplification. However, the outer hair cells generate
force most efficiently at frequencies below the characteristic frequency at most cochlear locations, raising the
possibility of additional functions. The proposed project combines two topics that have previously been
investigated independently—mechanics and fluid homeostasis of the OoC. By combining these two subjects,
we propose the novel hypothesis that active outer hair cells enhance mass transport along the cochlea.
 We will test the hypothesis with three aims that combine physiological and computational modeling
approaches. For Aim 1, experiments in live animals (gerbil) will be used to characterize the effect of sound and
outer-hair-cell motility on mass (neurotoxin) transport along the length of the cochlear duct. Aim 2 experiments
will use excised cochlear tissues implanted in a novel micro-fluidic chamber to characterize the OoC peristaltic
vibrations due to outer-hair-cell motility. For Aim 3, new biophysical computer models will simulate drug
delivery along the cochlea, thereby integrating physiological results from Aims 1 and 2.
 Approximately one out of five adults in the United States has some degree of hearing loss. Multiple
common forms of hereditary, age-related, and noise-induced hearing loss are ascribed to malfunctions of
cochlear-fluid homeostasis. By investigating cochlear-fluid homeostasis from an innovative point of view
(mechanics), this project will provide an explanation on why hearing of high frequency sound is more
vulnerable. In the long term, we have ambition to provide a remedy to delay/prevent hearing losses related to
fluid-homeostasis."
10747439,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are among the most common musculoskeletal complaints and are
becoming more common. These injuries cost the US health care system $5 billion dollars
annually. Prospective randomized and controlled studies have demonstrated that rotator cuff
repair (RCR) is indicated for small- and medium-sized tears. Over 500,000 RCRs are performed
in the US annually. However, after RCR, healing fails to occur in >25% of patients.
Understanding how to improve healing is a critical barrier to success. There is near universal
agreement that improving the biology of tendon healing is the key to improving healing. Our
prior research suggests Sex Hormone Deficiency (SHD, i.e. hypogonadism) plays a role in RCR
healing failure. The research described in the current proposal is the next step towards
translating our promising and compelling preclinical and laboratory findings into improved
clinical care of patients with RCTs. SHD can be treated with hormone therapy (HT), which is
widely utilized, well-tolerated, inexpensive, and FDA approved. Thus, we propose a phase II
study to test preliminary efficacy and feasibility. Within aim 1, we will estimate the preliminary
efficacy of systemic HT through a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial.
Hypogonadal men aged 40-80 with SHD will be included. Postoperatively we will evaluate: A.
RCR outcomes and B. RCR healing. We hypothesize that outcomes and healing will be better in
the HT group than the control group. Within aim 2, we will determine the feasibility of studying
systemic HT in the setting of RCR. Although there is extensive clinical experience with HT in
human males with SHD, there is almost none in a setting of RCR surgery. To determine the
feasibility of a future, larger, multi-center, randomized clinical trial, we will measure the following
within the context of the study described in Aim 1: A. recruitment and retention rates, B. patient
compliance, C. hormonal response, and D. adverse effects. The expected outcome of the work
proposed is demonstration of the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of HT in human males with
SHD undergoing RCR. If this intervention is effective and feasible, then a future, larger, well-
powered, multi-centered randomized clinical trial with longer follow-up would be warranted.
Such a study could improve the treatment of people with RCTs, thereby decreasing a source of
significant disability."
10805489,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and subsequently type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasingly common in adolescents, but the phenotype of
youth-onset T2D (YO-T2D) differs from adults. The NIDDK TODAY study we helped lead, demonstrated that
youth with T2D had a high (≈50%) and rapid failure rate on oral medications and faster need for insulin therapy
vs. adults treated for a similar duration in the ADOPT study. As further evidence, in our NIDDK RISE study,
where treatment responses in youth with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly diagnosed T2D were
directly compared to adults of similar BMI and initial glycemia, youth were twice as insulin resistant as adults
and had rapid deterioration of β-cell function and glycemic control compared to adults given the same
treatment with similar medication adherence. Finally in our HIP study, metformin did not improve insulin
sensitivity or secretion even when started early in puberty in normoglycemic youth with obesity, arguing for
innovative approaches. Of most concern, TODAY demonstrated an incidence of microvascular diabetes
complications ranging from 32-68% by a mean age of only 26.4±2.8 yrs, affecting individuals who should be at
their peak of productivity; complications more heavily affected those with minority race/ethnicity, raising
concerns related to health disparities. This unprecedented early morbidity and projected health care costs
mandate a focus on defining a) the ideal T2D diagnostic and/or screening criteria for youth b) pathophysiologic
distinctions between Y-T2D and adult-onset T2D c) how to prevent Y-T2D d) how to better treat Y-T2D once
present. Though some risk factors for developing Y-T2D (e.g. family history, obesity, etc.) are well-established,
only a small subset of these high-risk youth progress to T2D as adolescents. Thus, other causal components
need to be explored, such as adverse childhood experiences, stress, poverty, racism, sleep/circadian rhythm,
subtle differences within sedentary behavior, and the exact impact(s) of pubertal hormones. We propose to
enroll and follow longitudinally 3,540 diverse youth (236 from our site) at risk for developing T2D from urban
and rural locations who are early in puberty, and perform longitudinal assessments every 6 mo (HbA1c,
Taneda scale every 6 mo, OGTT/DXA/MRI, yearly) paired with additional sample storage to be analyzed once
a “critical mass” of youth with new-onset T2D is accumulated. We propose the following Specific Aims,
developed in collaboration with our stakeholders/community members from populations disproportionately
affected by T2D: 1. To assess patterns of change in metabolic and pubertal events, we will measure: glycemia,
insulin sensitivity/secretion, body composition, free living behaviors, and pubertal hormones, as well as bank
blood, stool, hair, and urine. 2. To assess psychosocial and psychological factors, we will measure stress,
discrimination, teasing, microaggressions, social status, access to care, depression/anxiety, and cortisol. 3. To
use the data collected in Aims 1 and 2 and apply unbiased data analysis methodology to identify biomarkers
for progression risk and develop a prediction model for who will develop Y-T2D."
10911005,"Suicide is a lethal problem for Veterans. A major challenge in predicting and preventing suicide is that ideation
and suicide behaviors fluctuate over time, as do the cognitive, emotional, and physical states that precede them.
Recent advances in mobile health technology hold promise for intensively measuring risk factors for suicide that
are proximal, time-varying, and occur naturalistically in daily life using smartphones. Cognitive factors - including
cognitive control and social cognition - play a role in suicide risk; to date, however, mobile health tools have not
been adopted to objectively measure cognitive performance fluctuations in Veterans. To address this gap, we
propose to use our previously developed mobile health tool for measuring cognitive control and social cognition
in the daily lives of Veterans with elevated suicide risk. Drawing on our experience delivering mobile health
assessments in individuals at-risk for suicide, we will examine the dynamic relationships between cognitive
performance and suicide, as well as other contextual variables associated with suicide risk. A transdiagnostic
sample of Veterans with current suicidal ideation will complete concurrent mobile cognitive tests (MCTs) and
ecological momentary assessments (EMA) within a two-week intensive assessment. Our aims are to identify
associations between cognitive test performance and constructs closely linked to suicide risk (restricted coping
ability, negative interpersonal beliefs, ideation). We also seek to examine how relationships established in the
intensive mobile health longitudinal dataset relate to real-world suicide outcomes which we will derive from the
electronic medical record and telehealth assessments. We will use the dataset to identify subtypes of Veterans
based on their temporal pattern of suicidal ideation and examine associations between subtypes and real-world
suicide outcomes. Finally, we will explore the role of specific context variables (e.g., sleep) in suicide risk.
Deliverables from this project will include an intensive longitudinal dataset that overcomes limitations of
traditional static laboratory-based assessments. This dataset can be leveraged to assess additional real-time
proximal risk factors associated with suicide in longitudinal studies and interventional research on the cognitive
underpinnings of suicide."
10852872,"Project Summary/Abstract:
HCC is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recurrence rates after curative
resection remain high, especially in high-risk HCC which includes large tumors (>5 cm), multifocal disease and
tumors with vascular invasion. Further complicating clinical management of HCC is the fact that currently no
neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies are available. We now also appreciate that recurrence is mediated via immune
mechanisms. In support of this are observations that increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells are associated with
better outcomes and less recurrence in resected HCC. Conversely, high proportions of immune inhibitory cells
including tumor associated fibroblast (TAMs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T regulatory cells
(Tregs) contribute to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and poor prognosis in HCC. Other soluble
mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), and platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF), are also secreted by tumor cells to promote an immunosuppressive environment.
This proposal will determine how the multikinase activity of regorafenib complements antitumor activity of anti-
PD-L1 antibody therapy, by targeting key pathways of relevance to Tregs, MDSCs, and TAMs, all of which
contribute to resistance to immunotherapy. Thus, by targeting multiple kinases that foster maintenance of these
cells, we postulate regorafenib will limit their persistence in the microenvironment and improve the efficacy of
PD-L1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting of HCC. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that multikinase
inhibition with regorafenib will limit suppressive features in the HCC tumor microenvironment and permit more
robust effector CD8+ T cell expansion and infiltration upon immune checkpoint blockade. This hypothesis will
be tested via two aims: 1: To determine the effects of regorafenib and durvalumab on suppressive immune
features in HCC. 2: To define the impact of neoadjuvant regorafenib and durvalumab on chemokine signatures
and infiltrating T cell phenotypes in HCC tumors. In the current proposal, we will advance the field by applying
this novel combination in high-risk HCC in the preoperative setting. Using innovative translational approaches
and patient specimens from early to intermediate stage HCC, we will address relationships between inhibitory
immune cells and CD8+ T cell subsets. This approach also provides a unique opportunity to explore mechanistic
effects of the regorafenib and durvalumab combination in the TME by utilizing paired tissue samples. It will further
our knowledge of changes in the TME induced by the immunotherapy/targeted therapy combination, help
understand mechanisms of resistance and define the next steps in improving the current regimen. Developing a
new and effective preoperative systemic therapy at this critical point in disease progression may provide the best
chance for improved long-term survival and therefore have a significant impact on the outcome of HCC."

localization resulting in lengthy incomplete surgeries and repeat visits. Our objective is to provide physicians with
an entirely new multimodal molecular imaging strategy that has the potential to offer 1) intra-operative surgical

improve therapeutic decision-making. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an ideal cancer on which to
develop our new multimodal imaging approach as it suffers from poor tumor demarcation and is easy to access
with optical imaging tools. We intend to develop an entirely new class of multimodal nanoparticles (NPs) to serve
as our tumor targeting contrast agents. These new NPs are intended to provide real-time fluorescence image
guidance during tumor resection and Raman multiplexed imaging to identify molecular expression and drug
target availability for effective therapy. These multimodal NPs have the potential to provide physicians with a
molecular map of the tumor with improved sensitivity and specificity not previously achievable with existing single

major problems in gaining regulatory approval. Our innovative approach utilizes the dyes that are already FDA
approved for the coloring of our foods, drugs and cosmetics. Color is all around us, however, we often take for

they in fact have a multitude of useful optical properties (e.g. absorbance, fluorescence, Raman scattering) that
make them ideal for imaging applications. We propose to integrate these dyes and their multimodal imaging
capabilities into a nanoparticle construct specially designed to provide useful imaging contrast that enables
improved cancer detection, localization and molecular profiling. We will begin our study by characterizing the
physical characteristics of these newly fabricated NPs and their multimodal imaging capabilities. This will include
in-vivo evaluation of their biodistribution and extravasation properties by utilizing multiple molecular imaging
tools. We will then test their tumor targeting efficiency in cell culture and on human tissue. Our nanoparticles will
actively target tumors through chemically conjugated targeting ligands and/or passively target the tumor through
the enhanced permeability and retention effect. We will assess the tumor targeting efficiency and surgical
navigation potential of our newly developed NPs with pre-existing preclinical and clinical molecular imaging tools.
These studies will enable the repurposing of these aesthetically pleasing household organic dyes as multimodal
imaging probes to enable an entirely new, and clinically translatable, paradigm. The images generated from
these multimodal nanoparticles could improve cancer detection and localization for improved surgical resection,
but also aid clinicians in the design of treatment protocols which are most suitable for the individual patient."

To investigate how disease relevant changes, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are linked to specific risk factors
(e.g., age-related changes, protein aggregates, vascular pathologies, etc.) to alter the spatial arrangement
of cell types in the brain and their gene expression profiles, we need to build high-resolution maps of brain
tissue at the cellular level in individuals with and without pathology. Building these maps requires proper
characterization of the pathological features, as well as a reproducible workflow for data generation and
imaging. To this end, the Integrated Computational Analysis Core will work closely with the Spatial Multiomics
Core, the Biospecimen Core, and the four Projects on all aspects of imaging and genomics data analysis.
This includes the following: 1) Primary analysis, comprising image registration, segmentation, and gene
expression quantification, 2) Secondary analysis, comprising cross-sample registration and cell type
assignment using multiplexed protein expression and genome-wide transcriptomics data, and 3) Tertiary
analysis, involving the derivation of discrete measurable attributes summarizing key aspects of cell type,
gene expression, and pathological composition and distribution in space. By scaling up and adapting existing
workflows to address these data analysis needs, this Core is centrally involved in all analysis aims of each
Project, as well as being engaged in continuous feedback with the Spatial Multiomics Core to optimize data
generation workflows. An additional goal of this core is to integrate the raw and processed data, as well as
the spatial attribute models, into a queryable, interactive portal called the Multidimensional Atlas of Aging and
Pathology in the Brain (MAAP-Brain) visualizer. This publicly accessible portal, along with dissemination of
workflows through the educational component of this overall U19 proposal, will provide the brain aging and
AD scientific community with an interface to engage with the large-scale data generated by the Projects and
other Cores. Ultimately, we aim for this dissemination effort to allow external researchers to generate or
validate their own hypotheses about changes in cellular composition and arrangement associated with aging

10935943,"PROJECT 4: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the past two decades, we have come to appreciate that the aging brain harbors a multiplicity of
neuropathologies and that AD proteinopathy often coexists with other pathologic features such as Lewy Bodies
and TDP43 proteinopathy. However, the impact of co-occurrence remains poorly understood. Co-occurrence
also increases with advancing age, highlighting that age is a critical risk factor for all of the neuropathologies that
we examine in our 3D Aging & Alzheimer Brain Program. This project aims to profile brain tissue from a large
(n=300) set of diverse individuals to create a complementary resource to those produced in Projects 1-3. Here,
we profile a random sample of participants in the RUSH cohorts to capture the heterogeneity seen in the older
population. In addition, we leverage their detailed ante-mortem characterization of neuropsychologic function to
relate molecular data and the cellular attributes identified in Projects 1-3 to cognitive decline, the ultimate,
clinically meaningful outcome in AD. Amyloid, tau and CAA all influence cognitive performance in the ROSMAP
cohorts. In particular, preliminary results from single nucleus RNAseq data suggest a critical role for a new
microglial subtype, Microglia 13 (Mi13), in AD and CAA. Thus, the new 3D dataset that we propose to generate
and distribute as part of this Project will enable us to test a specific hypothesis that we have today and to uncover
new insights from unbiased analyses. Our samples also include 100 African-American (AA) participants from the
ROSMAP and MARS cohorts that have the same clinicopathologic traits and multiomic brain data as the 200
non-hispanic white (NHW) participants. Here, we therefore explicitly complement the other Projects, which focus
on Non-Hispanic White participants, by sampling a large number of AA subjects so that we can assess the
generalizability of our findings to a broader population. The integrated analysis of the data in this project with the
attributes identified in the other three projects will lead to a new set of candidate proteins involved in cognitive
decline, which will be used to profile a replication cohort of an independent set of participants. Thus, the key
goals for us are (1) the creation of an easily repurposable, high-impact dataset, (2) the testing of a current
hypothesis and (3) assembly of an important set of new insights into AD and CAA that can be used to seed
further investigation, including some dedicated to AA. Overall, this Project creates a unique reference data set
that can be repurposed for a multitude of uses and leveraged to design a next generation of spatial transcriptomic
(ST) studies for other neurodegenerative diseases."
10771113,"Project Summary
Insulin resistance (IR) is a major health problem in the U.S. It precludes type II diabetes and is often present in
patients suffering from obesity, both being major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Currently,
mechanisms leading to IR are not fully understood. ET-1 is a vasoactive peptide primarily released by
endothelial cells. It is increased in patients with obesity and associated with IR. ET-1 is elevated in response to
hypoxia, which occurs in individuals with obesity. It activates two receptors, ETA and ETB, which typically
oppose each other physiologically. Our preliminary data indicate that inhibiting ETB receptors in rodents, either
genetically or pharmacologically, improves insulin tolerance and reduces fasting blood glucose. This
improvement in glucose control is associated with an increase in plasma adiponectin and adipose adiponectin
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) mRNA. In addition, adipocyte specific ETB
gain of function mice have exacerbated glucose intolerance in response to high fat feeding, while adipocyte
ETB knockout mice have improved glucose and insulin tolerance compared to floxed control littermates. These
data suggest the adipose tissue as a possible target for ET-1 induced reduction in insulin signaling. It has been
previously shown that activation of ETB receptors on cultured adipocytes inhibits the anti-lipolytic effects of
insulin. Furthermore, blockade of ETB receptors improves insulin sensitivity in a rodent model of sleep apnea.
These data suggest that increased ET-1 observed in patients with obesity may promote IR via the ETB
receptor. Thus, we hypothesize that that obesity induced tissue hypoxia promotes ET-1/ETB receptor
activation in adipose leading to IR on adipocytes, PPAR-γ inhibition and reduced Adiponectin release
by adipocytes thereby causing IR in muscle and liver tissue. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize both in
vivo and in vitro techniques. First, using cultured adipocytes, we will determine whether activation of ETB
receptors inhibits PPAR-γ, reduces adiponectin secretion, and causes insulin resistance on adipocytes. Next,
we will used clinically approved inhibitors of ET-1 receptors in a model of diet induced obesity and IR, and we
will utilize two novel mouse models that were produced by our lab that allow us to over-express or knockout
the ETB. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be tested:
Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ETB receptor activation directly inhibits insulin signaling on
adipocytes and reduces adiponectin production by inhibiting PPAR-γ.
Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that ETB receptor activation on adipocytes promotes insulin resistance
by inhibiting PPAR-γ and reducing adiponectin release in mice.
Specific aim 3: To test the hypothesis that ETB receptor blockade increases plasma adiponectin and improves
insulin resistance in obese mice."
10794218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Errors associated with DNA replication, transcription, mRNA processing, and protein biogenesis result in the
continuous production of potentially toxic defective proteins. The error-prone nature of these essential processes
requires robust quality control (QC) systems to effectively triage and destroy defective translation products.
Protein quality control is an essential component within the larger protein homeostasis (proteostasis) system and
proteostasis dysfunction has been implicated in human aging-related pathologies. On one hand, elevated protein
QC function is needed to enable neoplastic cell proliferation in cells with high mutational burdens or chromosomal
abnormalities. Conversely, impaired proteostasis and defects in protein QC function result in the enhanced
production of misfolded and toxic aggregation prone proteins that typify many neurodegenerative disorders.
These observations suggest that developing molecular strategies to predictably alter QC function to either
enhance, or limit QC capacity as needed can improve aging-associated disorders and extend human healthspan.
However, there is a surprising and substantial gap in our understanding of not only how QC systems selectively
engage their substrates, but also how substrates evade detection during proteostasis dysfunction. To make
substantive progress toward the goal of leveraging QC systems to combat aging-associated disorders, it is
necessary to identify and characterize cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable detection and degradation
of diverse QC substrates. Recent research progress from my lab has identified a spatially restricted QC pathway
that acts on stalled and collided ribosomal complexes both before and after translation initiation to target
defective translation products for degradation and recycle ribosomal complexes. Further, we have developed a
systematic pipeline for biochemical, structural, and cellular interrogation of enigmatic but critical QC ubiquitin
ligases that have been implicated in targeting diverse substrates for degradation by unknown mechanisms. We
have focused our initial studies on the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1. Our recently described HUWE1 structure
represents the first full-length structure of a HECT-domain ligase. We have generated a unique and powerful set
of genome-edited cell lines and HUWE1 variants that have and will enable molecular dissection of HUWE1
function, HUWE1 substrate identification, and identification of cellular stress conditions that require HUWE1 for
cellular survival and proliferation. Research outcomes achieved by the proposed studies will mechanistically
determine how terminally stalled ribosomes are sensed and resolved and how ribosome-associated QC
pathways can be manipulated to alter proteostasis function. Further, we will establish mechanisms by which QC
ligases engage substrates under normal and stressed conditions. Successful completion of the proposed
research will provide substantial progress toward our long-term goal of combating aging-associated human
pathology through the development of molecular strategies to modify cellular responses to chronic proteotoxic
stress and improve cellular fitness following proteostasis insults."
10907405,"Project Summary / Abstract
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a leading delivery vector for gene therapies of a wide range of genetic
disease and predilections. The FDA has recently approved AAV-mediated treatments for spinal muscular
atrophy (SMA) and RPE-associated retinal dystrophy, while 150 clinical trials are ongoing. However, inefficient
transduction requires high doses with risk of immunotoxicity that has been evident in clinical trials.
 A genome-wide screen for host proteins, needed for AAV cell transduction, changed the understanding
of AAV entry. Hitherto-uncharacterized AAVR was identified as a key receptor, while the downstream role of
GPR108 is most likely in endosomal escape. AAVR cryo-EM structure will be put into biological context.
Studies of GPR108 will start by pinpointing the entry step and cell location where AAV and GPR108 associate,
and identification of the domains with which AAV interacts. The approach to structure will be holistic. Overall
configuration will come from cryo-electron tomography (ET) of AAV complexed with native-like GPR108
nanodiscs. This will be integrated with high resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM) of AAV complexed with
expressed extracellular domains of GPR108. Triggers will be investigated of an AAV conformational transition
that releases a virally-sequestered phospholipase A2 for endosomal escape, as AAV traffics to the nucleus.
 Antibody neutralization of AAV is widely considered mediated by interference with glycan-binding or of
a post-entry step. This will be reevaluated after finding overlap in the binding of AAVR and several neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies. Prevalent in vivo modes of binding will first be established through cryo-EM using
polyclonal antibodies from pooled human serum. Mutations, directed towards escape, will be used to test
whether receptor-binding and entry are, in fact, primary mechanisms of neutralization, and whether escape to
rapid neutralization by pre-existing antibodies can be designed without harm to receptor-mediated cell entry.
 Computer methods, optimizing atomic structure vs. cryo-EM maps, prototyped during AAV studies, will
be developed and disseminated. Modules will implement the RSRef algorithm, unique in matching to map
values, a sum of 3D atomic profiles of refinable experimental resolution. This will be combined with open
source force fields, opening an emerging application of atomic resolution cryo-EM in determining hydrogen
bonding networks and protonation states. For resolutions below 3 Å, restraints eliminating unnecessary
freedom will be introduced to limit the over-fitting that is an under-appreciated problem in EM refinement.
 The project’s main goal is a molecular understanding of AAV’s host interactions, providing structural
and mechanistic foundations for engineering needed improvements in vector efficiency and specificity in
development of safe gene therapies. Broader collateral impact will come from a model system for viral entry
that will be put to rigorous practical test, and computer methods for improving the precision of EM structures."

The overall objective of this project is to develop a clinical system that fuses laparoscopic video and
laparoscopic ultrasound for enhanced visualization and navigation of laparoscopic procedures. Real-
time video acquired using a laparoscope remains the primary visualization and guidance modality in
over 14 million procedures performed per year globally, but it shows the operating surgeon organ
surfaces only. Laparoscopic ultrasound can show internal structures, but is often displayed on a
separate screen, leaving the surgeon to perform a mental integration of the 2 modalities. This task is
inefficient, subjective, and variable with expertise. Introduction of a needle in the surgical field for
ablative procedures further increases the surgeon's cognitive load by needing to register multiple
sources of information for understanding three-dimensional spatial relationships and for maintaining
hand-eye coordination. The proposed real-time data fusion, which we refer to as augmented reality
(AR), presents complementary information to the operating team in an intuitive way. Research,
development, and clinical translation efforts preceding this proposed project have demonstrated the
technical feasibility and clinical utility of the proposed AR visualization and navigation. The team has
successfully developed research prototypes and used the most recent prototype in 11 human cases at 2
different surgical centers. This proposal is borne out of the real-world lessons from our clinical
translation experience toward building a clinical system. The major areas of improvement include
reducing system complexity and size and improving reliability and clinical viability. Children's National
Hospital and Terason will collaborate to develop custom specialized laparoscopic ultrasound
transducers and offer AR as a well-integrated advanced application on a commercial ultrasound
platform. The specific aims for this project are to 1) develop custom tracked laparoscopic ultrasound
transducers, 2) develop a commercial-grade ultrasound system with integrated tracking and AR
technologies, and 3) conduct preclinical evaluation of the developed system. Our scientific premise is
that comprehensive intraoperative visualization of normal and pathological anatomy and navigated
guidance of ablation needles will improve the precision, safety, and efficiency of prevailing laparoscopic
procedures, and expand their utilization. The proposed academic-industrial partnership is designed
such that these benefits are realized through the development of a clinical system ready for routine use
in the operating rooms worldwide."
10783745,"The role of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis remains largely understudied. Little is
known about how astrocytes change their functions/properties under different reactive states and what
consequences such changes cause under pathological conditions. The JAK/STAT pathway is a key player in
inducing astrocyte reactivity in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Active JAK/STAT signaling has been
observed in human AD brains and AD animal models, and plays a vital role in promoting AD-related pathology
and cognitive deficits in AD model mice. However, how the JAK/STAT pathway is activated in astrocytes during
AD progression and how AD-related astrocyte reactivity affects other brain cells to promote AD pathology remain
unclear. OSM receptor β (OSMRβ), encoded by the Osmr gene, is a key upstream activator of the JAK/STAT
pathway in response to stimulation by Oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines.
Significantly, Osmr has been revealed as a prominent disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) marker, while genes
encoding other JAK/STAT upstream activators are not specifically associated with DAAs, suggesting that
OSMRβ plays a unique role in AD-related activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in astrocytes. Our functional tests
showed that activation of OSMRβ increased expression of multiple DAA markers in astrocytes, whereas
astrocytic deletion of Osmr (referred to as OsmrcKO), or blockade of OSMRβ signaling using an OSM neutralizing
antibody, significantly reduced Aβ-induced expression of DAA markers. These data suggest that OSMRβ plays
a crucial role in initiating AD-related astrocyte reactivity. Moreover, treatment with the OSM neutralizing antibody
attenuated Aβ deposition in AppNL-G-F knock-in mice and improved their cognitive performance, supporting a role
of OSM/OSMRβ in modulating these AD-relevant processes. To further support the disease relevance of OSMRβ
in AD, we found that its level was elevated in postmortem AD brains. Collectively, our preliminary data reveal a
novel OSMRβ/JAK/STAT axis that plays a crucial role in initiating astrocyte reactivity and promoting AD-related
pathology and cognitive deficits. Our central hypotheses are that activation of the OSMRβ/JAK/STAT axis
induces AD-related astrocyte reactivity to drive AD progression and that OSM/OSMRβ signaling represents an
attractive target for AD therapy. We will test these hypotheses in three aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the
molecular features of OSMRβ-initiated JAK/STAT signaling and determine its role in inducing AD-related
astrocyte differentiation and heterogeneity. In Aim 2, we will examine how OSMRβ/JAK/STAT-induced astrocyte
reactivity leads to multi-faceted functional impairment of astrocytes as well as neurons and microglia. In Aim 3,
we will test whether blocking OSM/OSMRβ signaling effectively ameliorates AD-related pathological and
cognitive deficits. Successfully accomplishing the proposed studies will reveal fundamental information about
the heterogeneity and functional impact of AD-related astrocyte reactivity and offer preclinical insight into
targeting OSM/OSMRβ signaling for improvement of AD-related neuropathology and cognitive deficits."
10757452,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by resistance to current therapies, a high degree of
desmoplasia, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This scientific proposal focuses on
cyclic AMP Response Element Binding protein 1 (CREB) as a transcriptional factor downstream of KRAS that
promotes disease aggressiveness and poor survival. Genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of CREB leads
to significant attenuation of PDAC tumor burden and improved survival in multiple murine PDAC models. Utilizing
high throughput sequencing approaches, we have identified tumor cell-derived leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
as a key CREB-regulated immunomodulatory cytokine, serving as a possible paracrine mediator of tumor-
macrophage crosstalk in the TME. We hypothesize that targeting the CREB-LIF signaling axis can remodel the
immunosuppressive TME by significantly impacting tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)s and reinvigorating
the T cell-based adaptive anti-tumor immune response to improve the efficacy of checkpoint immunotherapy.
Based on our preliminary data, the critical role of the CREB regulated LIF signaling will be investigated through
three specific aims. 1) Elucidate the molecular mechanism and impact of CREB regulated LIF in PDAC
oncogenesis. Here, we will assess the CREB-mediated regulation and functional roles of tumor cell-derived LIF
by exploring the nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, interaction with transcriptional complexes, and gene regulatory
networks. We identify the CREB-LIF axis requirement in the tumor cell growth using CRISPR/Cas9 genome
editing with CREB on or off in vivo pancreas tissues and evaluate the expression of LIF relative to CREB in
patient PDAC tissues, patient-derived xenografts, and primary tumor derivative organoids. 2) Determine how
CREB-dependent LIFR signaling in macrophages impacts the tumor immune landscape. We hypothesize that
the CREB modulates LIF release and promotes TAM infiltration/polarization towards a tumor-promoting M2-like
phenotype via activating STAT3 in macrophages. We will determine the effect of CREB-regulated LIF release
on TAM activity using CREB on or off with LIF knockout tumor cells and assess the impact of CREB-regulated
LIF signaling on the adaptive immune response and TME during PDAC progression in myeloid-specific knockout
models of Lifr and Stat3, and 3) Determine if CREB inhibition and conventional immunotherapeutic approaches
reduce tumor growth and improve overall survival. We hypothesize that the tumor cell-intrinsic CREB-LIF
activation is a pivotal switch that drives immune suppression in the pancreatic TME, which can synergize with
immune checkpoint inhibition. We will use CREB inhibitor with checkpoint inhibitor to establish the safety of the
therapies and study tumor growth and overall survival in genetic mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and
organoids to further complement these preclinical studies. Together, these results will provide new therapeutic
strategies to reduce mortality from this disease. Furthermore, these studies can be broadly applicable to the
myriad of other malignancies where CREB-LIF signaling is altered."

Stem cells self-renew and differentiate into various cell lineages to sustain tissue homeostasis and functions.
Most tissue microenvironments comprise multiple components, including epithelial, stromal, immune, and
endothelial cells, that interact with each other to coordinate response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. There
remains an unmet need for in vitro models that can capture tissue heterogeneity and enable high-throughput
studies.
The PI developed Micro-OrganoSpheres (MOS) that can be established rapidly and efficiently from small
amounts of primary tissues. Allowing self-renewal and differentiation of adult stem cells to recapitulate key tissue
characteristics, MOS also sustain the original tissue microenvironment, enabling both ultra-high-throughput
assays aided by deep-learning algorithms and direct microbial-host interactions.
For the next R35 period, MOS will be leveraged as a fundamental research tool for understanding interactive
processes in heterogeneous tissues in a systematic and scalable manner. Three projects are proposed:
(1) We will set up a high-throughput MOS screen to systematically study how different cell types in a
heterogenous tissue respond to different microbes.
(2) We will develop a MOS combinatorial indexing technique to probe how cell-cell interactions in local
microenvironments lead to spatially heterogenous tissue responses.
(3) We will use MOS engraftment and intravital imaging to understand cell fate decisions and progression
of stem cell niche from development to adulthood.
The success of these projects will elucidate the mechanisms by which 1) different cells coordinate locally to
respond to stimuli and 2) the stem cell niche progresses during growth. Furthermore, this research will provide
the broader scientific community with basic research techniques that can be generalized to understand a wide
variety of tissue and stem cell functions."
10794219,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epilepsy negatively impacts quality of life due to the seizure burden and associated depression and anxiety, in
addition to increased morbidity and mortality. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms
of focal epilepsy. Anti-epileptic medication is successful in treating about 60-70% of these patients. In the
remaining patients, usually after long, unsuccessful drug trials, surgical intervention of the presumed seizure
focus leads to seizure freedom in 50-80% of patients. Therefore, more accurate early predictors of
pharmacological and surgical treatment outcome are needed to improve clinical management of these
patients. The scientific premise of this work is that while the identification of the seizure focus plays an
important role in directing management of focal epilepsy patients, the outcome of treatment (pharmacological
and surgical) is significantly influenced by the connectivity across large widespread network(s).Therefore, the
goal of this project is to develop early biomarkers of drug responsiveness and surgical outcome using MRI
functional and structural connectivity quantification. In a homogeneous group of drug refractory mesial TLE
patients whose seizure focus was presumed to be the hippocampus based on current clinical assessments,
the relationship between resting-state functional and structural network integrity in seizure propagation
networks were quantified non-invasively using MRI. These network alterations were related to disease and
cognitive characteristics before and after surgery. This allowed the development of a preliminary MRI
connectivity biomarker for post-surgical seizure outcome in mesial TLE. Building on this foundation, the
specific aims of this proposal will result in the improvement of functional and structural connectivity biomarkers
of surgical outcome in mesial TLE (Aim 1), and the development of similar biomarkers for use in other TLE
patients with seizures originating in the temporal lobe outside the mesial temporal structures (Aim 2). The
success of Aim 3 will provide a method for early identification of those who will and will not respond to anti-
epileptic medication to reduce prolonged drug trials. The overall outcome of this work will directly address the
2014 NINDS Benchmarks for Epilepsy Research section III part B: to identify biomarkers for assessing or
predicting treatment response, including markers that may identify specific populations that are likely to have
good outcomes or develop adverse responses. As such, this study has the potential to result in significantly
improved clinical management of a common debilitating disorder."
10756930,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a common cause of early-onset dementia, encompasses a group of disorders with significant genetic, clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity. Understanding the diverse underlying mechanisms of FTLD pathogenesis is a fundamental area of interest of my research program. To accelerate scientific discovery, we have adopted a comprehensive approach that investigates multiple FTLD mechanisms driven by key molecular players (e.g., TDP-43, progranulin, and tau). We also place great emphasis on translational research geared towards identifying much needed biomarkers and therapies, an area of particular importance given that there exists no treatment for FTLD. Our endeavors to uncover the pathomechanisms associated with TDP-43, tau and FTLD-causing mutations have yielded seminal findings published in high-impact journals. For instance, in the five years since the discovery of the G4C2 repeat expansions in C9ORF72 as the most common known cause of FTLD, my group identified a new neuropathological hallmark specific to this mutation, namely the accumulation of proteins of repeating dipeptides synthesized from the expansion; made significant strides in elucidating mechanisms of disease relating to these so-called c9RAN proteins; identified promising therapeutic strategies and potential biomarkers for C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers; and developed the first mouse model to recapitulate both neuropathological and clinical features of patients. Our productivity is influenced by the excellent research environment fostered at Mayo Clinic, which brings together highly interactive and devoted neurobiologists, geneticists, neuropathologists and physician scientists, as well as the numerous collaborations we have forged with world-renowned experts in the field. Herein, we propose to extend our discoveries by addressing impactful questions, some of which may be high risk, but all with clear potential to be transformative to the field. Of importance, the nature of the R35 mechanism will allow us the flexibility to explore intriguing new directions that emerge from our findings and those of others, ensuring that our studies remain timely and relevant. Overall, with the goal of advancing our understanding and developing therapies for FTLD, we propose mechanistic and translational investigations relating to three main areas: 1) C9ORF72-linked FTLD-TDP; 2) GRN-linked FTLD-TDP; and 3) FTLD-Tau. We will explore various therapeutic approaches, seek to identify disease-relevant biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and develop and improve FTLD animal models."
