 Heart failure (HF) is the major cardiac syndrome and treating chronic HFis an unmet need in the United
States and worldwide. Therapeutic options for advanced heart failure target systemic stress pathways and sur-
prisingly few therapies exist that directly target failing heart muscle. Our long-term goal is to use our under-
standing of the biology of failing myocardium to develop muscle specific therapeutic solutions. The key patho-
logical hallmark of HF is an abnormal calcium transient, impairing both contraction and relaxation. In small ani-
mals and humans, cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1), which organizes calcium microdomains and the cal-
cium handling machinery, is diminished in both systolic and diastolic heart failure. In these rodent models of
HF, cBIN1-microdomains are disrupted and can be normalized by cBIN1 gene therapy for functional rescue
and reduction in arrhythmogenic incidence. Whether the observed HF rescue by cBIN1 gene therapy in rodent
models of HF can be translated to human patients requires a preclinical step in large animals. A validated ca-
nine model of ischemia induced HF will be used to understand key regulators of T-tubules and sarcoplasmic
reticulum microdomains, restore function, and improve mortlity in failing hearts.
 The overall objective of this application is to test a cBIN1 gene therapy in a preclinical large animal
model of ischemic HF. Our central hypothesis is that in a canine model of ischemia induced HF, adeno asso-
ciate virus 9 (AAV9)-transduced exogenous cBIN1 restores functional contractility and reduces arrhythmogenic
substrate. The central hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing two aims: Specific Aim 1) Determine in a
canine model of ischemic heart failure whether cBIN1 gene therapy provides a functional and mortality benefit.
In vivo echocardiography, invasive hemodynamics, and serum biomarkers of cardiac stress and remodeling
(NT-proBNP, cBIN1 score), will be monitored after cBIN1 therapy. Specific Aim 2) Determine in a canine
model of ischemic heart failure whether cBIN1 gene therapy reduces arrhythmic events and substrate develop-
ment. Continuous telemetrically recorded ECG monitoring, electroanatomical endocardial mapping and VT in-
ducibility testing, and mapping of cardiac activation, intracellular calcium, and transmembrane voltage will be
performed to determine the effectiveness of cBIN1 gene therapy in reducing the arrhythmogenic substrate.
 It is anticipated that this cBIN1 gene therapy will be the first therapy in medicine that directly targets and
reverses the cellular remodeling in the myocytes of failing hearts, rescuing cardiac function, provides a mortal-
ity benefit, and reduces arrhythmias prevalent in ischemic HF. This proposal will explore the effectiveness of
this therapy in a highly relevant pre-clinical ischemic HF model and move this therapy from a promising lab
finding closer to clinical realization."

Age-related neurodegenerative diseases place a substantial and increasing socioeconomic burden on society.
Age-related dementias including Alzheimer’s disease represent some of the greatest unmet medical
challenges facing the aging population in the US. To date clinical interventions for these diseases have had
very modest impact despite major efforts to develop new therapeutics. This landscape suggests that we are
still missing fundamental information regarding the root cause of these diseases and the specific cellular
vulnerabilities that lead to disease progression. We propose that a critical element of theses disease may
relate to local synaptic metabolism. The brain is highly vulnerable from a metabolic point of view: severe
hypoglycemia results in overt and severe neurological problems including delirium and coma. Furthermore, as
we age (and aging is the strongest correlate of all these afflictions) the efficiency with which we can deliver fuel
to tissues (including the brain) and convert this fuel into the useful biochemical currency, the high-energy
intermediate adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), both degrade. Although these neurodegenerative disorders
ultimately lead to neuronal death it is thought that much earlier symptomatic problems arise from synaptic
dysfunction. My laboratory recently discovered that nerve terminals represent one of the likely loci of the
brain’s metabolic vulnerability: they consume large amounts of ATP but store little rapidly usable high-energy
molecules and must therefore locally synthesize ATP to maintain function. We also discovered that synapses
relay on several mechanisms to upregulate ATP that are essential for synapse function. Additionally, we
discovered resting nerve terminals consume large amounts of ATP to maintain the synaptic vesicles proton
gradient but that this energy burden likely varies across neurotransmitter type. We propose to test the
hypothesis that neurodegenerative diseases have a strong local metabolic component by examining how
genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disease specifically impact the local metabolic balance and do to
determine if this might be a driver of disease-driven synapse impairment. Although certain neurodegenerative
diseases disease initially present with other overt symptoms (for example movement disorders) over time they
most frequently convert to dementias in the majority of patients. Here using quantitative approaches we will
determine how nerve terminals in a metabolically vulnerable neuron population rely upon glycolysis versus
oxidative phosphorylation to support function, examine if maintaining the vesicle proton gradient places a large
energetic burden on the nerve terminals (Aim1), determine if the disease mutations associated with
mitochondrial integrity specifically impact the balance of ATP (AIM2) and determine if a number of other known
disease associated mutations increase metabolic vulnerability by altering the local balance of ATP production
versus consumption in this critical neuron population (Aim3). The lessons and insights learned from these
studies should then prove valuable in informing the pathology of a larger class of dementias."

Over 2,500 children undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in the United States each year for an
increasingly broad set of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Unfortunately, pulmonary complications after
HCT are a leading cause of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and are frequently associated with a complex
overlap of respiratory infection, viral reactivation, alloreactive inflammation, treatment-related lung injury, fluid
overload, and other toxicities. In clinical practice, differentiation of pulmonary infection and non-infectious
inflammation is challenging and failure to accurately diagnose pulmonary complications is associated with
significant mortality. Further, an incomplete understanding of the varied biology of post-HCT pulmonary
complications has to date limited the application of targeted therapeutics necessary to improve survival.
Therefore, the goal of this K23 proposal is to advance our understanding of the pathobiology of post-HCT
pulmonary complications in children. To do this, we will apply metagenomic sequencing technology to lower
respiratory biospecimens from two geographically distinct pediatric cohorts. In Specific Aim 1a, we will determine
the composition of the pulmonary microbiome in pediatric HCT patients with different subtypes of lung disease
and will identify occult pathogens that can be implicated in disease. In Specific Aim 1b, we will model the
outcome of transplant-related mortality (TRM) according to microbiomic characteristics while controlling for
potentially confounding clinical traits. In Specific Aim 2a, we will analyze patterns of pulmonary gene expression
in order to improve our understanding of dysregulated biological pathways involved in lung injury after HCT. In
Specific Aim 2b, we will associate TRM with human gene expression signatures in order to identify high-risk
patients with shared biology that may benefit from molecularly targeted interventions. In sum, these aims will
develop a platform with which to more accurately diagnose pulmonary infections and identify discrete cellular
pathways involved in infectious and non-infectious post-HCT lung injury. The knowledge gained from this
investigation will be directly useful in improving diagnostic and prognostic classification schema necessary to
adapt targeted therapeutics and improve patient outcomes.
The candidate's career goal is to improve molecular characterization and treatment of pathobiologic subtypes of
lung injury in children who have undergone HCT. In this K23 application, the candidate has proposed a detailed
career development plan focused on developing a technical, methodological, and bioinformatics expertise in the
execution of impactful research in this rapidly evolving cross-disciplinary field. The candidate is trained in
Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, holds a faculty position at the University of California, San Francisco, and is
well supported by an experience mentoring and scientific advising team. This K23 proposal will generate robust
data to inform a subsequent R01 submission facilitating the candidate's transition to an independent scientific
career aimed at improving outcomes for pediatric HCT patients with lung injury."

Astrocytes respond to CNS damage and disease with changes in gene expression and morphology and with
immune activation to become reactive astrocytes. Alcohol Use Disorder is characterized in part by
neuroimmune responses that increase with the progression of the disorder. Reactive astrocytes upregulate the
expression of Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) encoded by the gene Plat, which is involved in brain
plasticity, the remodeling of the brain extracellular matrix, and neuroimmune responses including microglial
activation and neuroinflammation. tPA is upregulated by ethanol in several brain areas and in astrocytes in
several models of ethanol exposure. The main scientific questions driving the proposed studies are: 1) What
are the changes in translating RNA occurring in astrocytes after Chronic Intermittent Ethanol-2 Bottle Choice
(CIE-2BC)? 2) What are the changes in nuclear gene expression occurring in astrocytes after CIE-2BC? 3)
Does Plat/tPA knock-down in astrocytes reduce escalation in drinking, neuroimmune responses, and synaptic
changes induced by CIE-2BC? We hypothesize that: CIE-2BC induces changes in the translation of
neuroimmune genes in astrocytes and that some, but not all, changes in translation are driven by changes in
transcription. We also hypothesize that knocking down Plat selectively in astrocytes will attenuate escalation in
drinking, induction of neuroimmune genes, and synaptic changes induced by CIE-2BC. We propose to use the
Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mouse model that allows the selective pull down of actively translating RNA from
astrocytes by the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method. Moreover, this mouse line has GFP
fluorescence in the nucleus that allows for the isolation of astrocyte-specific nuclei by Fluorescent-Activated
Cell Sorting (FACS). In Specific Aim 1 we will study the translatome in amygdala and PFC of female and male
Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice after CIE-2BC by TRAP-RNA-seq. Pathway analysis will be performed to
determine enrichment in the biological processes affected by CIE-2BC. We will employ TRAP-qPCR, Western
blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate changes in neuroimmune gene translation and protein
expression. In Specific Aim 2 we will study the nuclear transcriptome in the amygdala and PFC of female and
male Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice after CIE-2BC by FACS sorting of astrocyte nuclei followed by RNA-seq. We
will integrate transcriptome and translatome data to identify RNAs regulated by alcohol through transcription-
dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms. We will employ FACS-qPCR and Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH)-RNAScope to validate changes in neuroimmune gene expression. In Specific Aim 3 we
will investigate the hypothesis that tPA knock-down in astrocytes attenuates CIE-2BC-induced escalation of
drinking, immune response, and synaptic changes. Inducible Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 mice will be crossed to floxed
Plat mice for the selective knock down of Plat in astrocytes. Mice lacking tPA in astrocytes will undergo CIE-
2BC; drinking escalation, immune response, and synaptic changes will be assessed."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and a major cause of blindness, limb amputation and kidney failure. It has reached epidemic proportions worldwide with a prevalence exceeding 10% in the US. The pathophysiology of T2D involves defects in insulin homeostasis including insufficient insulin secretion from the pancreas, impaired insulin action in muscle, liver and adipose tissues (insulin resistance), and reduced insulin removal from the circulation (insulin clearance) predominantly by the liver. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of insulin secretion and insulin resistance has been a major focus of investigations for decades, which has resulted in successful antidiabetic therapeutic strategies. In contrast, insulin clearance has been a relatively understudied area in diabetes research. Its molecular determinants are incompletely understood and its role in the etiology of T2D remains unclear. Reduced insulin clearance may represent a beneficial metabolic adaptation to insulin resistance that promotes compensatory hyperinsulinemia to limit the burden on -cells and likely protect against T2D. Conversely, it has been proposed that impaired insulin clearance may exacerbate insulin resistance by driving hyperinsulinemia- mediated downregulation of insulin receptors. It has also been hypothesized that genetically reduced hepatic insulin clearance constitute a primary causal factor in the development of T2D. Clearly, the mechanisms and physiological correlates of insulin clearance deserve further attention.
A limitation of experimental investigations of insulin clearance is the relative dearth of known molecular determinants that regulate this process. In previous studies, we identified CEACAM1 as a critical factor in hepatic insulin clearance. While the role of CEACAM1 in receptor-mediated insulin internalization, an initial step in cellular insulin clearance, and metabolic homeostasis is now well established, the molecular mechanisms and mediators of subsequent steps in cellular insulin trafficking are less well understood. Thus, the overall objective of the present proposal is to extend our understanding of this process through the discovery of novel molecular determinants and characterization of their role in systemic insulin/glucose homeostasis.
Motivated by the high heritability of insulin clearance observed in humans, we embarked on a hypothesis-free genetic approach. Using a collection of ~100 inbred mouse strains in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, we performed transcriptome and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes and molecular pathways associated with steady-state C-peptide/insulin (C/I) molar ratio, a surrogate measure of insulin clearance. Our preliminary results provide several novel insights. First, they implicate the AMPK pathway in the regulation of cellular insulin clearance and identify this process as a previously unrecognized metabolic target of AMPK signaling. Moreover, we identified Tmem175 as a novel genetic determinant of insulin clearance in the mouse. While Tmem175 has not previously been characterized in the context of insulin metabolism, it has been implicated in endosomal pH regulation, a key process in the degradation and intracellular trafficking of insulin and the insulin receptor (INSR). Furthermore, the TMEM175 chromosomal region is associated with T2D in human populations, which lends support to the hypothesis that variation in TMEM175 activity may affect diabetes risk and highlights the potential translational relevance of this project. We will follow up on our preliminary results as described below:
Specific Aim 1: To investigate the role of AMPK pathway in insulin clearance. We will use primary hepatocytes to investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of insulin clearance by AMPK. Pharmacological and genetic approaches will be employed to modulate AMPK activity and the impact on insulin binding, internalization and degradation, as well as the endocytic trafficking of INSR will be assessed. To identify downstream effectors of AMPK signaling in the regulation of insulin clearance, we will test the role of direct AMPK phosphorylation targets in cellular insulin clearance using gain- and loss-of- function approaches. The effect of AMPK signaling on systemic insulin clearance will be evaluated through pharmacological activation of AMPK in C57BL/6J mice and in mice with liver-specific genetic ablation of AMPK.
Specific Aim 2: To investigate the role of Tmem175 in insulin clearance and metabolic homeostasis. To gain mechanistic insights into the role of Tmem175 in cellular insulin metabolism, we will assess insulin binding, internalization, degradation and INSR trafficking in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. The role of Tmem175 in systemic insulin clearance will be assessed in whole-body Tmem175-deficient mice and its impact on hepatic insulin extraction will be investigated in mice with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated liver-specific suppression. Furthermore, we will evaluate the metabolic impact of Tmem175 deficiency through longitudinal analyses of insulin and glucose homeostasis in the context of pre-diabetes using diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and the genetically obese db/db mice with established T2D.
We anticipate that these studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of insulin clearance and its role in the pathophysiology of T2D. Furthermore, our work will lay the foundation for novel therapeutic approaches in T2D based on the manipulation of insulin clearance."

This application seeks to understand how temporally-dynamic information is incorporated into social decisions by investigating the influence of social hierarchy on basic neural and cognitive processes engaged in valuation and learning. While some kinds of social information are stable, others can fluctuate in a way that can shift a social context. Hierarchy, or the organization of individuals according to power and status, is a common feature of most social animal species including humans and is a kind of social information that can exhibit both stable and transient qualities. Knowing a person’s place in society may shape an individual’s decisions to trust or learn from them. Critically, deficits in social decisions, broadly, are observed in psychopathologies ranging from autism to schizophrenia and potentially, such deficits might arise from maladaptive monitoring and integration of time-varying social features such as hierarchy. While stable hierarchical identities like socioeconomic status or gender could influence a person’s decision to trust or learn from professionals like medical doctors or teachers, situational contexts can further transiently increase or decrease perceived differences in power or status (e.g., being at a hospital or in a classroom). The intersection between these stable and transient features of hierarchy are especially important because power dynamics may engage distinct or overlapping mental processes. For instance, patients might be more proactive in suggesting alternative therapies if they perceive healthcare providers to be of similar social status. These processes might further modulate different kinds of decisions depending on implicit goals. Affiliative and competitive goals might be under dissociable influence of hierarchy if the neural and cognitive processes involved in the decisions only partially overlap. While traditional psychological experiments have investigated human social decisions using anonymous or unknown partners (which offers important experimental control), this limitation is detached from real-world scenarios in which humans acquire dynamic information about the people with whom they are interacting. Studying the neural mechanisms involved in these decisions can provide information about the basic cognitive processes that contribute to maladaptive decision making. Specifically, computations in brain regions like the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction supporting reward maximization over costs, mentalizing, and learning abilities are important for interactions with others. Notably, the functional roles of these regions are consistently implicated in clinical disorders like schizophrenia and autism, which share common social behavior deficits. Therefore, understanding the brain mechanisms involved in the integration of social hierarchy with learning and decision making can provide transdiagnostic insight about social behavior. This examination of interactions between psychological constructs like reward valuation and learning with social processes achieves and extends the goals of the Research Domains Criteria (RDoC) Initiative by considering the temporal elements of social context at the neural and cognitive levels. Aim 1 of this proposal will investigate how stable and transient social information is integrated in decisions with affiliative goals. Here, participants will make decisions about sharing rewards in a distribution game. Specific hypotheses will be tested by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modelling to test whether neural representations can distinguish costly sharing of rewards between oneself and others when information is provided about others’ social status and power in both stable and transient domains. Aim 2 will extend these mechanisms to a competitive social learning context. During fMRI, participants will perform a task that permits evaluation of complex belief learning from decisions made by opponents. Hypotheses will evaluate whether brain mechanisms supporting social learning depend on competitors’ perceived status and power. Studying these processes in the same participants who complete the experiment in Aim 1 will further allow comparison of hierarchical identity representation. Specific test will evaluate whether humans form latent representations that change depending on the context across different dimensions: affiliative versus competitive goals, stable hierarchy position, and transient hierarchy position. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how these neural representations relate to daily social interactions and personal experiences with social inequality. When interacting with others whose perceived hierarchy is either ambiguous or different than one’s own, humans tend to deploy emotion regulation strategies. Deficits in emotion regulation abilities, however, are symptomatic of a range of psychopathologies. Therefore, here we will identify whether neural representations of social hierarchy are related to daily life social-hierarchy related emotion regulation and abilities to mentalize the intentions of people who vary in social hierarchy. The correspondence of brain mechanisms to real-world decisions outside of the lab can inform potential future interventions that alleviate social decision-making deficits in psychopathology. Overall, this proposal has been designed to combine the candidate’s expertise in functional neuroimaging and economic decision making to prepare the candidate for an independent research career focused on neural mechanisms of social decision making."

A prerequisite for tumor development is acquiring resistance to apoptosis. This can be accomplished through
multiple mechanisms, but a frequent alteration in human cancers that protects from apoptosis is the
overexpression of one or more of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. BCL2 itself is frequently
overexpressed in multiple types of B cell lymphomas and many other lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies.
Because of the perceived reliance of cancer cells on BCL2 for survival, a targeted specific BCL2 inhibitor was
developed, ABT-199 (venetoclax). Although, venetoclax has been FDA approved for the treatment of specific
leukemias, clinical trials with venetoclax have not been successful for B cell lymphomas with high levels of BCL2,
such as follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) that have translocated or amplified
BCL2. The results indicate these lymphomas do not require BCL2 for their continued survival, revealing a
significant gap in knowledge of what lymphomas use to protect themselves from apoptosis. Recently, we made
the unexpected discovery that BCLW, an unexplored anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member that was only thought
to be important in spermatogenesis, was overexpressed in six different types of B cell lymphomas, including
follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. We determined patients with DLBCL containing higher levels of BCLW had
reduced survival, and BCLW was more highly expressed than BCL2 in higher grade follicular lymphoma. We
also showed BCLW was necessary for the survival of Burkitt lymphoma cells, and increased levels of BCLW
provided resistance to Burkitt lymphoma cells to an inhibitor that targets three anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
members. Therefore, we hypothesize BCLW overexpression is necessary for the survival of multiple types of B
cell lymphomas and confers resistance to lymphoma cells to venetoclax and other BCL2 family inhibitors. We
propose two Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate the requirements of BCLW in multiple
different B cell lymphomas in relationship to other BCL2 family members and mechanisms for its overexpression.
In Aim 2, we propose to determine the contribution of BCLW to resistance to inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL2
family members and ways to overcome this resistance. Completion of these Aims will significantly increase
knowledge into the BCL2 family of proteins and the contribution of BCLW to B cell lymphomas and resistance to
targeted inhibitors of BCL2 family members. Results are also likely to lead to improved lymphoma clinical trials,
diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic interventions with knowledge based treatment combinations."
10772972,"Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounting for more than 85% of these cases. KRAS, the most common oncogenic driver in NSCLC, confers a
poor prognosis with limited treatment options. LKB1 is the third most frequently mutated gene in NSCLC. The
mutations in both KRAS and LKB1 account for about 30% of NSCLC, with increased aggressiveness, a high
frequency of metastases and resistance to therapeutics. Autophagy degrades proteins and organelles and
recycles them to provide metabolic substrates, a function that is critical when extracellular nutrients are limited.
Although the role of autophagy in cancer has been intensively studied, the precise role of autophagy in cancer,
especially in vivo, remains elusive and controversial. Moreover, targeting autophagy to treat cancer generally
has not contributed significantly to the advancement of clinical trials. Therefore, identifying genetic vulnerability
that renders strong sensitivity to autophagy inhibition is urgently needed to improve autophagy targeted-
therapies. LKB1 regulates energy homeostasis by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which
inhibits catabolic processes and upregulates anabolic processes, in response to energy crisis. Based on earlier
studies, we began to test the hypothesis that loss of LKB1 promotes cancer cell proliferation but also restricts
adaptation to metabolic stress, a property that may be further compromised by loss of autophagy. Using
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of NSCLC, we found that autophagy inhibition was synthetically
lethal in KrasG12D/+;Lkb1-/- (KL) mediated tumorigenesis; in contrast to KL lung tumors with intact autophagy, loss
of an essential autophagy gene, Atg7, dramatically impaired both tumor initiation and tumor growth. This is in
sharp contrast to wild-type LKB1 (KrasG12D/+;p53-/-) tumors that are much less sensitive to essential autophagy
gene ablation. Our in vitro study further revealed that autophagy modulates lipid metabolism essential for KL
cancer cells to survive nutrient starvation. These observations indicate that LKB1 mutations predispose KRAS-
driven NSCLC to autophagy inhibition and that LKB1 mutations could be explored as a predictive biomarker for
precision lung cancer therapy. Based on our recent findings, we form our central hypothesis: autophagy
compensates for LKB1 loss by maintaining the metabolism of Lkb1-deficient Kras-driven lung tumors and
promoting their metastasis. We will test this with following specific aims: Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanism by
which autophagy regulates lipid metabolism and KL tumorigenesis in vivo. Aim 2. Determine how autophagy
promotes KL tumor metastasis. Aim 3. Identify metabolic bypasses that potentially create resistance to
autophagy inhibition in KL NSCLC. Successful completion of this proposal will: (1) yield new insights into the role
of autophagy in modulating cellular metabolism in support of KL lung tumorigenesis and metastasis; (2) validate
the novel concept that autophagy inhibition is a selective and powerful therapeutic strategy against primary and
metastatic KL NSCLC; and (3) reveal metabolic bypass as a potential mechanism of therapy resistance."

 The purpose of this US-China Biomedical Research Collaboration project is to understand the role of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and to validate BBB
permeability imaging as an early marker of SVD. SVD is a major cause of stroke, white matter (WM) disease
and dementia, but the mechanisms underlying brain damage and cognitive decline remain largely elusive. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that BBB breakdown initiates disease onset and progression in humans with
genetically defined SVD (NOTCH3 mutation carriers suffering from cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL). The proposal will use a unique cohort of
Chinese CADASIL patients already lined up for study inclusion at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University
in Beijing. With cutting-edge BBB permeability imaging techniques at 3 and 7 Tesla, using dynamic contrast
enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted arterial spin labeling (DW ASL), as well as other innovative
biomarkers of SVD as part of the MarkVCID consortium (www.markvcid.org), we will systematically investigate
the clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging changes during CADASIL progression. In 3 aims, we will first
evaluate the repeatability and correlation between BBB permeability to Gadolinium-based contrast agent
(GBCA) and water respectively in the cohort of Chinese CADASIL patients. Using a longitudinal study, we will
then determine the initiating role of BBB breakdown using DCE MRI and DW ASL in the cohort of Chinese
CADASIL patients to test the hypothesis that increased BBB permeability in NOTCH3 mutation carriers
initiates disease onset and progression, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions, development of WM
lesions and free water content, ischemic infracts and mircrohemorhages, and cognitive decline. We will further
develop and evaluate a multiparametric MRI protocol for CADASIL patients including BBB permeability
imaging at ultrahigh field of 7T. Leveraging a unique cohort of Chinese CADASIL patients, and applying
cutting-edge imaging approaches at 3 and 7T, this US-China Biomedical Collaboration project will define the
initiating role of BBB dysfunction in cerebral SVD, and will establish the BBB as a new key target for
therapeutic interventions in CADASIL and by extension SVD. This project will also result in cutting-edge BBB
permeability imaging protocols at 3 and 7T as early imaging markers of SVD."

Our data show that RTK−SOS1/2−WT RAS signaling is a critical therapeutic target in RAS-mutated cancers.
Our objective is to differentiate between those RAS-mutated cancers in which inhibiting RTK−SOS1/2−WT
RAS−effector signaling should be part of an overall effective therapeutic strategy.
Direct RAS inhibition as a monotherapy is not effective long-term. RAS proteins show differential activation of
RAF and PI3K pathways: HRAS potently activates PI3K but poorly activates RAF, whereas KRAS potently
activates RAF but poorly activates PI3K. Because of these differences, inhibiting mutant RAS will not effectively
inhibit both the RAF and PI3K pathways. Further, similar to MEK inhibition, mutant RAS inhibition relieves
negative feedback controls leading to rapid hyperactivation of RTK−WT RAS signaling. A more comprehensive
understanding of the interplay between mutant RAS and RTK−WT RAS signaling is essential to developing
rational therapeutic approaches to treat RAS-mutated cancers.
We found inhibition of RAS effectors activated poorly by mutant RAS synergizes with and limits resistance to
mutant HRAS and KRAS inhibitors. The mutant HRAS inhibitor tipifarnib blocks PI3K signaling and synergizes
with MEK inhibitors; covalent KRASG12C inhibitors block MEK signaling and synergize with PI3K inhibitors. We
also found that the RASGEFs SOS1 and SOS2 have unique and overlapping functions that promote mutant
RAS-driven transformation. SOS1 is critical for mutant RAS activation and SOS1 inhibition augments the
efficacy of mutant RAS inhibitors. RTK−SOS2−PI3K signaling protects cells from anoikis and mediates mutant
KRAS-driven transformation depending on the PI3K mutational status. SOS2 KO synergizes with MEK inhibitors
only in PPIK3CA WT cells, whereas SRC inhibitors synergize with MEK inhibitors only in PIK3CA-mutated cells
as was previously reported. These observations suggest the hypothesis that inhibiting RTK−SOS1/2−WT
RAS−effector signaling will impair resistance to, and augment, current therapeutics targeting mutated RAS or
downstream RAS effectors. We will test this hypothesis with the following Aims:
This proposal elucidates the molecular mechanisms through which SOS1/2−WT RAS signaling drives
transformation of cancers harboring specific mutant RAS isoforms. We perform studies using a combination of
defined genetic model systems and more cancer-relevant systems including CRISPR-modified human cancer
cell lines, xenograft studies, and studies using GEMM models to: Determine how WT RAS isoform signaling
cooperates with oncogenic RAS to promote oncogenic transformation. Characterize the role of SOS1 in
mutant RAS-driven proliferation and transformation, both independently and in combination with SOS2.
Establish SOS2 and SRC as therapeutic targets in patient-derived colon cancer organoids based on
KRAS and PIK3CA mutation status. Our findings will inform novel therapeutic approaches for eradicating
subsets of RAS-mutated tumors with genotype-dependent precision."
10773067,"Ferroptosis and Cancer Cell Signaling
Summary
 Programmed cell death (PCD) plays important role in normal biology, and its deregulation contributes to the
development of various diseases. Ferroptosis is a PCD modality driven by cellular metabolism and iron-
dependent cellular lipid peroxidation. Mounting evidence indicates that ferroptosis is involved in multiple
pathological conditions, including cancer. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of ferroptosis is important
for both fundamental biology and disease treatment.
 While most mechanistic investigation of ferroptosis focuses on intracellular molecular events, our recent
studies revealed a conceptually novel mechanism for ferroptosis regulation that is non-cell autonomous: in
epithelial cells, E-cadherin-mediated intercellular interaction suppresses ferroptosis through intracellular
Merlin/NF2-Hippo signaling; antagonizing this signaling axis unleashes the activity of the proto-oncogenic
transcriptional co-activator YAP to promote ferroptosis through regulating multiple ferroptosis modulators. As E-
cadherin and Hippo-YAP signaling are key regulators of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), our work
provides mechanistic insights into the recently published observation that mesenchymal and metastatic
properties of cancer cells are highly correlated with the sensitivity of cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Our
preliminary studies furthersuggest that malignant mutation of E-cadherin and multiple components in the Merlin-
Hippo-YAP signaling pathway can be used as biomarkers predicting cancer cell responsiveness to future
ferroptosis-inducing therapies. Considering that loss of function mutations of tumor suppressors E-cadherin,
NF2, and Lat1/2 (components of Hippo signaling), as well as super-activation of YAP oncoprotein, are all
malignant events that make cancer cells more resistant to common therapies and to apoptotic cell death, our
finding that these same mutations instead render cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis induction is
unexpected and highly important both conceptually and clinically.
 Based on these preliminary results, in this proposal, (1) intercellularly, we will investigate the molecular
basis underlying the role of E-cadherin in transducing signals into the intracellular machinery, thus functioning
as both a tumor suppressor and counter-intuitively, an inhibitor of ferroptosis; to further expand this concept, we
will determine if other cell adhesion molecules can also regulate ferroptosis via similar mechanism; (2)
intracellularly, we will determine how YAP dictates ferroptosis sensitivity via its transcription co-regulating
activity; and (3) relevant to cancer, as E-cadherin mutation is highly frequent in gastric cancer, a fatal disease
currently without effective treatment, we will investigate the role of E-cadherin tumor suppressor in determining
gastric cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, and the potential role of E-cadherin-regulated ferroptosis in gastric
cancer metastasis. Genetically engineered mouse models for gastric cancer, as well as gastric cancer patient-
derived tumor organoids and xenograft mouse models, will be used for this preclinical investigation. Taken
together, success of the proposed research will unveil in-depth mechanisms of ferroptosis, as well as its
functional communication with various cancer-relevant intercellular and intracellular molecular events. The
proposed research will also lead to the identification of biomarkers that predict cancer responsiveness to future
ferroptosis-inducing cancer therapy."

This study will provide novel insights on cognitive trajectories among new liver transplant recipients,
and the impact of cognitive function on self-management, health behaviors, and patient outcomes.
The prevalence of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in North America is estimated at up to 1,000 per
100,000 population and has nearly doubled over the past two decades with baby boomers (born 1945-1965)
accounting for half of cases. From 2009 to 2016, there has been a 65% increase in cirrhosis mortality in the U.S.
Decompensated cirrhosis has a 5-year survival of only 34-56% with liver transplantation (LT) as the only life-
saving option. By 2033, LT demand will increase by 23% and per-patient LT-associated costs will rise from $1.4
to $2.1 million, resulting in a total of $26.7 billion in transplant-related medical expenses over a 10-year time
horizon. To maximize the benefits of LT, liver transplant recipients (LTRs) must have strong self-management
skills to navigate health systems, adhere to clinical monitoring, and take complex, multi-drug regimens. All of
these tasks require formidable cognitive abilities for active learning and problem solving. LTRs are at higher risk
for poorer cognition due to high prevalence of pre-transplant cognitive impairment (hepatic encephalopathy),
multiple chronic conditions, alcohol use, and increasing age. The cognitive status of LTRs over time could affect
self-management and transplant outcomes, yet these issues have not been thoroughly investigated.
Our proposed cohort study (`LivCog') will longitudinally characterize cognitive performance using the NIH
Toolbox among 450 new LTRs from 3 diverse transplant centers, beginning at transplant waitlisting and then at
1, 4, 12, and 24 months post-LT. We will also serially assess self-management skills, physical function, health
behaviors, patient-reported and clinical outcomes. Potentially modifiable post-transplant targets will be
investigated, including caregiver support, physical activity, sleep, and treatment adherence to understand causal
pathways that could inform future health system responses. Our specific aims are to: 1) assess pre to post-LT
cognitive trajectories and identify risk factors for persistent cognitive impairment, 2) evaluate associations
between cognitive function and self-management skills, health behaviors, functional health status, and post-
transplant outcomes, and 3) investigate potential mediators and moderators of associations between cognitive
function and post-transplant outcomes. Our proposed LivCog study will fill critical gaps in understanding
cognitive recovery and function, risk factors and consequences of cognitive impairment among LTRs. Findings
will directly inform future interventions to improve post-transplant outcomes."

Treating and caring for the more than 6.5 million older adults in the U.S. living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
presents the largest burden from a single disease on the healthcare system, with costs exceeding $320 billion
per year for AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD). While deaths due to major diseases (e.g., stroke, heart
disease, and cancers) have declined, AD and AD-related deaths have increased substantially, with a projected
cost of about $1 trillion per year to the US economy by 2050. Although AD is currently irreversible, new
therapeutic approaches and prevention strategies are under extensive investigation. Over 50% of the
pharmacologic agents currently being tested for AD target aberrant brain metabolism. Thus, it is essential to
establish a concrete relationship between metabolic dysfunction and pathologic features of AD brains.
However, comprehensive whole-brain metabolic mapping, including cortical and subcortical brain regions that
are highly relevant to AD pathology, has not been achieved, due to substantial technical challenges in
acquiring high-quality magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging data with sufficient spatial resolution
across the entire brain in clinically acceptable scan time. In this regard, we propose to generate a robust and
reliable metabolic mapping of the whole brain, including the cortical regions, by establishing technical
capabilities for three-dimensional echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (3D-EPSI). Building on our team’s
pioneering work in MR technical development and an existing collaboration, we are ideally positioned to make
integrative technical advances in nuisance signal reduction, improved spatial encoding, and real-time motion
and B0 correction, to create a state-of-the-art metabolic imaging approach. Accurate anatomy-based regional
data analysis tools (namely MetaSurfer) will also be developed to provide a novel surface-based approach to
processing whole brain metabolic imaging data. Thus, this project offers comprehensive whole-brain metabolic
imaging packages for a full end-to-end solution from robust data acquisition to novel data analysis. Using the
developed packages, we will create population-averaged normative whole-brain metabolic atlases in the aging
population after stratifying amyloid status (Aβ- and Aβ+), which will provide a statistical basis for assessing
metabolic alterations in AD. In our pilot clinical study of early AD, we will investigate the relationship between
brain metabolic imaging outcomes and molecular, genetic, morphological, clinical, and cognitive measures in
people with early AD, leveraging the available data from NIA AD Research Center (ADRC) resources and
ongoing AD clinical studies. This study will provide critical data for future large-scale clinical trials evaluating
new AD-treatment strategies as a part of the emerging field of metabolic and bioenergetic medicine for
AD/ADRD."
10747363,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurological impairment caused by aging or neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is
a major and growing health burden. Despite best efforts, traditional approaches to develop effective therapies
have been largely unsuccessful. Interestingly, studies in both human subjects and animal models have shown
that physical activity, especially endurance exercise, can improve cognitive function, mainly learning and
memory, in part by enhancing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Recent studies have highlighted the
importance of secreted factors in cell-to-cell and cross-organ talks in exercise. The secreted factors that
mediate the cognitive benefits of exercise represent very attractive drug targets.
Our previously published data identified the novel exercise hormone irisin, the cleaved and secreted from of
FNDC5 (fibronectin-domain III containing 5), as a prime candidate contributing to the cognitive benefits of
exercise. Based on this preliminary data, we hypothesize is that FNDC5, through its secreted form irisin,
acts as a critical regulator linking exercise to adult hippocampal neurogenesis resulting in
improvements in cognitive function. Our goal is to rigorously test this hypothesis by integrating mechanistic
molecular techniques, functional and morphological studies, and behavioral testing in genetic mouse models.
We will achieve this goal by addressing the following three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will determine whether
muscle-derived irisin is required for exercise-induced improvement in cognitive function. In Aim 2, we will test if
irisin is the active form to mediate the beneficial effects of exercise. In Aim 3, we will elucidate whether
peripheral elevation of irisin is sufficient to improve cognitive function in aging mouse models.
Successfully completing these experiments will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism
whereby exercise affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improves cognitive function. In addition, this
project will establish a framework for potentially using irisin to treat cognitive decline in aging or AD."
10747366,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Class Ia ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are anti-cancer and antibiotic drug targets due to their role in the
biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. They convert ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides using radical-
based chemistry with reducing equivalents coming from a pair of cysteine residues in the active site that form a
disulfide upon enzyme turnover. Recent structural work elucidating the active state structure of the class Ia
RNR of Escherichia coli has revealed for the first time, the intact 32-Å-long pathway for radical transfer
between subunits that is responsible for the generation of a catalytically essential radical species in the
enzyme active site. In this proposed research, I will investigate the role of water channels in the proton transfer
that occurs concomitant with electron transfer. I will also investigate the role of a tryptophan residue (W48) in a
radical transfer pathway that otherwise involves tyrosine residues. Furthermore, I will probe the structural
rearrangements that occur in order to facilitate re-reduction of the active site disulfide. This re-reduction
pathway is known to be dependent on the C-terminal tail of the α subunit of RNR, which shuttles reducing
equivalents from thioredoxin to the active site, but no structural snapshots of this process have ever been
captured. Here, I propose to use site-specific mutagenesis to investigate the involvement of water channels in
proton transfer by assessing the catalytic competency of RNR variants in which the water networks have been
disrupted. I intend to assess the role of W48 in the PCET pathway through the site-specific incorporation of
unnatural W analogues which will give us a spectroscopic handle with which to directly monitor radical transfer
to and from W48. Finally, I propose to capture structural snapshots of the re-reduction steps of RNR, including
a structure of RNR with thioredoxin using cryogenic electron microscopy. These studies will enable us to
answer several of the major outstanding questions of this prototypical RNR. This work will also enable me, a
physical inorganic and materials chemist by training, to gain expertise in biochemical and structural biology
methods which will inform new research directions that will benefit from a synthesis of these two skill sets. As
one of the world’s foremost research institutions, MIT is an ideal and highly collaborative environment in which
to pursue the studies described in this proposal. Furthermore, as an internationally recognized leader in the
field of structural biology, Prof. Drennan’s scientific mentorship will enable me to excel in my undertaking of this
research."
10747394,"Summary/abstract: Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide, costing the US Healthcare system
billions of dollars annually for surgical treatment. Lens opacification has been linked to dysfunction in major
membrane proteins, Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) and Lim2. The overall goal of my project is to develop a
comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions of
these membrane proteins. In the absence of a blood supply, the microcirculation system transports nutrients
and removes wastes to inner fiber cells and is essential for maintaining lens transparency over decades of life;
however, how this microcirculation system is established and maintained as a function of age is not well
understood. Using advanced mass spectrometry techniques such as hydrogen-deuterium exchange-MS,
native-MS and chemical crosslinking studies, I intend to elucidate how specific protein and lipid interactions
impact the structure and function of AQP0 and Lim2; membrane proteins that are fundamental to the
microcirculation system of the lens. The most abundant lens membrane protein, AQP0, plays important roles in
lens fiber cell adhesion and water permeability with water permeability regulated by interaction with the
calcium-binding protein, calmodulin. Data from my lab and others demonstrated that calmodulin interacts with
the C-terminal tail of AQP0; however, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations suggest a non-canonical interaction
with a cytosolic loop of AQP0. This MD prediction has not been experimentally validated. In addition to AQP0-
protein interactions (Aim 1), I hypothesize that AQP0-lipid interactions (Aim 2) regulate AQP0 permeability and
adhesion properties that underlie lens transparency; however, there are limited reports on AQP0 interactions
with native lipids. Given the vital role of AQP0 in maintaining lens transparency and its connection to cataract,
understanding regulatory interactions with proteins such as calmodulin and native lipids will clarify its role in the
microcirculation system. The second most abundant membrane protein in the lens is Lim2 and, like AQP0, its
mutation has been associated with cataractogenesis in mice; however, little is known about Lim2-protein
interactions (Aim 1). Binding partners to Lim2 have been reported, i.e. calmodulin and galectin-3, but how
these interactions modulate Lim2 structure and function are not clear. Additionally, native lens lipids have been
reported to impact Lim2 subunit assembly, but the details underlying this phenomenon have not been
explored. As a result of the scarcity of experimental research on Lim2-native lipid interactions (Aim 2), I will use
native MS to identify specific lipid interactions and determine how they affect Lim2 structure. My findings will
aid researchers develop therapeutic targets and/or practices that can prevent, reverse or delay cataract
formation."
10747427,"Project Summary
The broad and long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel quantitative methods and
biostatistical tools for microbiome data analytics to aid in microbiome-based discovery sciences. The
microbiome, also called the second genome of the human, has received much attention in the past few years.
Due to its critical roles in human health and disease, the human microbiome has now been recognized as an
integral part of the individualized medicine approach because it not only accounts for inter-individual variability
in all aspects of a disease but also represents a potentially modifiable factor that is amenable to targeting by
therapeutics. Despite those fruitful and promising findings from microbiome studies, there is no consensus in
the current field as how to appropriately analyze the data, let alone the optimality and efficiency issues that
have yet to be addressed. Several challenges amount to this predicament, including complex experimental
designs of microbiome studies, an unknown interplay between microbiome and host, extremely sparsity and
high dimensionality of the data, phylogenetic relatedness of the microbial taxa, and compositional structure of
microbiome. As a result, although quite a few analytical methods and tools have been developed for
microbiome data analysis, several specific gaps exist in the methodological toolbox, hindering the advance of
microbiome-based biomedical sciences. To fill these gaps, this proposal aims to develop robust and powerful
quantitative methods and tools for microbiome data analysis. Specifically, Aim 1 focuses on developing robust
and powerful methods for differential abundance analysis in complex study designs. It will develop new
methods to address zero-inflation, compositional effects and correlations in microbiome data. Aim 2 focuses on
strategies to increase the power of microbiome-wide multiple testing. It proposes two new multiple testing
procedures, which address confounders and phylogenetic relatedness, respectively. Aim 3 proposes to
develop compositional canonical correlation analysis methods for integrating microbiome data with other omics
data. Specifically, it will develop an efficient and flexible framework for integrating heterogeneous omics data
with microbiome data, accounting for compositional effects and phylogenetic relatedness. Aim 4 will develop
user-friendly and efficient software packages so the community can benefit maximally from methodological and
scientific advances resulting from this application. The proposed methods will be evaluated using simulations,
and more importantly, applications to several ongoing microbiome studies in the Center of Individualized
Medicine at Mayo Clinic. The proposed quantitative methods and open-source software packages will
contribute to microbiome biomarker discovery and microbiome-based mechanistic studies. All methods and
tools developed under this grant will be made available free of charge to interested researchers and the public."
10747432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most advanced cancer patients do not have an accurate understanding of their prognosis and treatment, which
interferes with patient-centered, high-quality healthcare. Gaining such information often requires patients to
confront stressful clinical discussions while understanding complex medical information. Existing interventions
to improve understanding largely target information delivery, without assessing and reducing psychological
barriers to hearing prognostic information accurately. This Pathway to Independence Award will equip Dr.
Heather Derry with the necessary skills to launch her independent research career, in which she aims to
identify and reduce stress-related barriers to informed medical decision-making among patients with cancer.
The candidate's prior work suggests that anxiety may reduce patients' accuracy for recently-discussed scan
results (used to monitor disease progression and inform treatment). In this career development award, the PI
will: (1) solidify targets and methods for a stress management intervention to improve patients' understanding
of prognostic information (i.e., scan results), then (2) adapt, revise, and (3) pilot test a stress management
program to reduce anxiety prior to key prognostic discussions. At Weill Cornell Medicine's distinguished Center
for Research on End-of-Life Care, the PI will receive expert mentorship and complete specialized training in
advanced cancer and end-of-life care, intervention adaptation and clinical trials, advanced psychophysiology
and statistics, and leadership. In the K99 phase, the PI will conduct an observational study to confirm pilot data
linking psychological factors to patient understanding, and investigate vagal tone (measured by heart rate
variability) as an underlying physiological mechanism for this pattern. Before an appointment to discuss scan
results during first-line treatment, 75 patients with advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer will complete
assessments of resting heart rate and self-reported anxiety, worry, and anticipatory stress. After the
appointment, patients will report their understanding of those scan results. Patients' answers will be compared
to audio-recorded clinical visits for accuracy. Analyses will test relationships between accuracy, psychological
factors, and heart rate variability. Qualitative interviews will elicit patients' preferences for intervention
adaptations and delivery methods. In the R00 phase, the PI will use this information to adapt an existing stress
management program (a public resource) to mitigate anxiety (and/or other targets) prior to these appointments.
Finally, the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy will be tested in a pilot randomized
trial, compared with usual care. Overall, the project will begin to address key psychological and physiological
factors missing from prior attempts to improve advanced cancer patients' understanding of prognostic
information. Given her prior training and research in health psychology, strong mentorship team, and proposed
training plan, Dr. Derry is well-positioned to become an independent investigator in this area, with the overall
goal of increasing quality of life and quality of care for people with advanced cancer."

evaluation of vaccines against Shigella sonnei, norovirus, cholera, and influenza; investigator-initiated trials
for novel RSV vaccines, and application of systems vaccinology tools to elucidate the cellular/molecular
pathways that lead to successful adaptive immune responses to vaccines in both young and aged
individuals. Investigators in our program lead a large U01-funded cohort study of pregnant women and their
infants studying the earliest responses to influenza infection and vaccination in order to understand the
principles of immunologic imprinting. The VTP features outstanding basic science faculty pursuing a wide
variety of projects relevant to vaccine development, including the areas of infectious disease pathogenesis,
novel immunogen design, basic aspects of immune development and regulation, computational and
functional genomics related to vaccines, and reproductive biology and immunology. The VTP will provide
training to M.D., Ph.D., and MD-PhD postdoctoral researchers that will facilitate their development into
successful independent investigators devoted to vaccine-relevant research. The program will support 4
trainees in the program per year, each appointed to 2-year terms. 22 expert mentors with strong track
records in scientific mentorship and NIH-funded research programs will serve as the VTP mentors and
faculty. Formal education in the breadth of vaccine sciences will be provided to all VTP trainees, including a
seminar course in vaccinology covering bench-to-bedside aspects of vaccinology, formal education in grant
writing, and targeted coursework relevant to the research project and focus (basic or translational) of
individual trainees. Our program is dedicated to recruitment of trainees from diverse backgrounds, races,
and ethnicities. The intended outcome is to nurture and develop VTP trainees into creative, independent
scientists who will form the vaccinology workforce of the future."

The long-term objective of UNC PREP in the Biomedical Sciences is to increase the number of individuals from
groups underrepresented in the biomedical workforce to become leaders that can significantly impact the health-
related research needs of the nation. The immediate goal of UNC PREP is to equip, encourage, and empower
talented post-baccalaureates scholars from underrepresented groups to matriculate and excel in top biological
and biomedical graduate programs. Since its inception in 2010, UNC PREP has strived to support the unique
needs of each scholar and to facilitate their transition into competitive PhD programs and research careers. In
this renewal, we will continue to provide immersive, high-quality research experiences, relevant comprehensive
professional development training, supportive program staff with scientific research backgrounds, and a cohesive
community of like-minded scholars with similar professional goals. An overarching framework of UNC PREP is
a programmatic design where each scholar can develop their “science identity” and acquire scientific self-efficacy
so that they see themselves as belonging in the greater scientific community. UNC PREP provides each trainee
with an institutional network of colleagues and mentors who can offer guidance and support success throughout
their career. With these goals in mind, we are expanding our student support efforts by introducing a new initiative
that will leverage the now extensive UNC PREP alumni network. “PREP T.R.A.I.L.S. (Training Researchers with
Alumni to Ignite Leaders in Science)” is geared towards providing targeted mentorship, networking, and career
exploration for our scholars by providing social engagement, improving sense of belonging within the local
scientific community, and to helping scholars envision a career path. In addition, the specific aims for UNC PREP
will continue to be 1) to formulate and carry out Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for each scholar, 2) to
provide an immersive research experience under the direction of a UNC faculty member (75% time), 3) to provide
comprehensive relevant coursework, professional development, and networking (25% time) for building
additional skills important for a successful science career. The program components will be continuously
evaluated using quantitative and qualitative measures of student progress and outcomes and will drive evolution
of program components to maximize positive outcomes and the development of well trained and prepared
scholars. During the first 12 years of UNC PREP, 93% of our scholars transitioned into competitive
biomedical PhD programs with 88% retention or completion of these programs. This renewal will continue
to build upon the highly effective strategies of UNC PREP. Ultimate success of UNC PREP will be defined as
scholars completing PhD programs and transitioning into scientific leadership positions such as academic
faculty, lead scientists in industry or government, or in other STEM careers."

Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and serious condition, accounting for more than 300,000
hospitalizations and over $2 billion in health care costs per year in the United States alone. Patients with AP
have an increased risk of several complications including diabetes (DM). Two recent meta-analyses suggest that
AP increases risk of DM by 23-37%, and that the risk increases over time. The pathogenesis of DM following AP
has historically been ascribed to the loss of β-cell mass, however other mechanisms, including the development
of insulin resistance or β-cell autoimmunity may also play a role.
The Type 1 Diabetes and Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC): The overall goals of the T1DAPC are
to describe the risk for and mechanisms of diabetes mellitus occurring after one or more episodes of acute
pancreatitis. Secondary objectives include defining the natural history of acute pancreatitis, the clinical risk
factors that predict development of diabetes and pre-diabetes, the natural history of beta cell function after
acute pancreatitis, and the potential contribution of an altered immune state to the increased risk for diabetes
after acute pancreatitis. These objectives are being addressed the ongoing, prospective, observational
T1DAPC study entitled “Diabetes RElated to Acute Pancreatitis and its Mechanisms (DREAM)”.
DREAM-ON: This ancillary study pilot proposal, entitled “Diabetes RElated to Acute Pancreatitis and its
Mechanisms: Metabolic Outcomes Using Novel CGM Metrics (DREAM-ON)” which will be conducted in
participants enrolled in the DREAM study, will test whether continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is clinically
useful to predict risk for developing diabetes, the need for insulin therapy among those who develop diabetes
and whether CGM can provide insight into the diabetes subtype among patients who have experienced an
episode of acute pancreatitis. Thus, the results of this ancillary study will complement and extend the primary
research questions in the DREAM study.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To perform CGM in all participants in the DREAM study in conjunction with their scheduled visits at
months 3, 12, 24 and subsequent annual visits and to determine if CGM metrics predict incident pre-diabetes
and DM.
Aim 2: To determine if CGM metrics predict need for insulin therapy in patients who develop DM after AP.
Aim 3: To determine whether CGM metrics correlate with measures of insulin secretion and insulin resistance
derived from the OGTT, MMT and FSIVGTT, and can be used as a surrogate to predict diabetes subtype."

 Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FA) are endogenous adaptive signaling mediators present in animal and human
tissues and fluids under basal conditions. They are formed at sites of inflammation and, most importantly, as an
interaction of dietary components containing nitrite and nitrate (e.g. leafy vegetables) and conjugated fatty acids
(e.g. dairy products, and plant seeds). NO2-FA are electrophilic and pleiotropic signaling modulators that have
demonstrated protective effects in various pathological conditions. They exert their signaling actions by reacting
with target proteins to activate Nrf2 and heat shock protein expression, inhibit NF-κB and STING inflammatory
signaling, and associated fibrotic events. During the R0, we discovered the presence of a new group of nitrated
species, NO2-conjugated linolenic acid (NO2-CLNA), in healthy human urines. These lipids contribute to 40% of
the total NO2-FA pool, despite the limited levels of the CLNA substrate present in the western diet. The
remarkable nitration yields and ease of nitration of CLNA under biological conditions, the levels detected in
humans, and the potential biological activities underscore the value of this proposal. We hypothesize that the
nitration of CLNA is a critical reaction in the gastric compartment that confers new metabolic, protective, and
anti-inflammatory functions to these conjugated fatty acids. We will test the hypothesis through the following
Aims:
Aim #1 Define the NO2-CLnA formation and absorption.
Aim #2 Define the reactivity, signaling properties, and metabolism of new bioactive NO2-CLNA
Through quantitative and mechanistic studies, this proposal has the potential to change the CLA and CLNA
paradigm and demonstrate an active role for nitration in conferring new signaling activities to these conjugated
fatty acids, impacting how we understand pharmacology of these dietary fatty acids."

Africa is the site of origin of modern humans, contains the greatest levels of human genomic
variation, and is the source of the worldwide range expansion of modern humans in the past
100,000 years. However, a fundamental gap in knowledge exists regarding African genomic and
phenotypic variation, resulting in a lag in biomedical research, not only in Africans, but also in
people of recent African descent. We will apply an integrative evolutionary genomics approach
incorporating genomic, metabolomic, microbiome, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data in
combination with detailed phenotypic data to reconstruct African population history and better
understand the genetic basis of adaptive traits in ethnically diverse African populations.
Specifically, we will use genome-wide SNP arrays as well as high-coverage whole genome
sequencing data to identify targets of natural selection in these populations and to look for genetic
associations with gene expression as well as anthropometric, cardio-metabolic, and immune
related traits. We will use functional genomics approaches to identify causal regulatory loci and
to study their impact on gene expression in vitro using high-throughput luciferase reporter assays
in appropriate cell lines. We will also use Crispr-Cas9 technology to validate and characterize the
functional impact of potential casual variants in both human cells and in vivo in model systems.
Lastly, we will characterize gut microbiome diversity and examine correlations with diet, genetic
and environmental variation. Our data will generate a deeper understanding of African genomic
diversity, population structure, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium that are critical for the
successful application and interpretation of genome wide association studies in African-descent
populations. Furthermore, this study will have important implications for understanding the genetic
basis of intermediate phenotypes (gene expression and the metabolome) and of complex traits in
Africans. In addition, the data collected will be an important resource for the biomedical research
community. Lastly, our study will shed light on human evolutionary history and evolutionary forces
shaping patterns of genomic variation in ethnically diverse humans."

Although the COVID-19 pandemic is leaving no one untouched, the health of older adults and Black, Indigenous
and other people of color (BIOPC) has been disproportionately impacted. Further, the emergent variants and
data demonstrating that at least some variants can be contracted and transmitted by those vaccinated are
accompanied by continued messaging emphasizing mask-wearing and social distancing, exacerbating
concerns of social re-engagement. An extant literature demonstrates that social distancing is linked to a host of
biopsychosocial consequences including psychological distress, loneliness, sleep disruption, pain severity, and
of particular relevance here, escalation in alcohol use and cognitive decline. Critically, these outcomes have
noted interactions and are particularly disadvantageous in the context of concurrent aging processes. Thus,
there are compelling arguments for study of biopsychosocial outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic among older
adults. Additionally, given the disproportionate impact on BIOPC and studies (albethey limited) illustrating race-
related differences in vulnerability to isolation related stressors, it is imperative that purposeful study of the role
of race/ethnicity be conducted. Finally, although there is a large literature detailing female sex as a risk factor for
increased vulnerability for psychological distress and related outcomes, the manner and degree to which such
risk would be evidenced in light of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and as a function of age and race/ethnicity
is not known. Currently emerging data address some of these issues as they were experienced in early phases
of the pandemic. However, characterizing the long-term consequences of this prolonged pandemic requires
conceptually-driven longitudinal study, expeditiously initiated. If delayed, information fundamental to scientific
progress and public health programming will be missed. Thus, guided by RFA AA-21-002 and existing data, we
propose a prospective, multi-method/multi-modal longitudinal study directed to clarifying the interactive effects
of COVID-19 stressors (i.e., sleep quality, psychological distress, loneliness/negative affect and chronic pain),
alcohol use and neurobiobehavioral decline/stability in 160 older (age 65-75) male and female current drinkers
(n=80 each) of both majority and minority race/ ethnicity (60/40 distribution) while controlling for essential
covariates such as emotional and physical proximity to COVID-19. Through longitudinal assessment across 3
years, we will define the pandemic’s evolving impact and clarify significant modulators of outcomes. Together,
these data will inform both scientific questions regarding the long-term impact of COVID-19 stressors, patterns
of alcohol use, and neurobiobehavioral change and public health planning and prevention efforts."
10786101,"Of the many immunotherapy approaches under development, the ability to use bispecific antibodies or
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to direct T-cells to selectively kill tumor cells has demonstrated significant
early success. Typically, bispecific antibodies or bispecific T-cell engagers (i.e., BiTes) cross-link T-cells by
binding to CD3 and to a target cancer cell surface antigen, usually through a monovalent interaction. An
alternative approach is to genetically engineer a cancer patient’s T-cells to express a single chain antibody
(scFv)-CD3ζ fusion protein that can target the cancer cell surface antigen. After re-introduction into the patient,
CAR-expressing T-cells have been able to selectively eliminate the target cancer cells. While successful, the
genetic engineering of cell surfaces is time consuming and irreversible and the use of BiTes requires
continuous infusion. Furthermore, the resistance to both approaches due to antigen loss has been observed.
 Our group has shown that two dihydrofolate reductase molecules (DHFR2) fused to an αCD3 single chain
antibody (scFv) can be engineered to spontaneously self-assemble upon the addition of the chemical
dimerizer, bis-methotrexate (BisMTX), into either highly stable octavalent chemically self-assembled nanorings
(CSANs). CSANs have been prepared with BisMTX containing a third arm, thus enabling it to be conjugated to
oligonucleotides, fluorophores, radiolabels and drugs. Recently, we have prepared αEpCAM/αCD3 CSANs
and αCD133/αCD3-CSANs. The bispecific CSANs rapidly (min) and stably (days) bind to CD3 on T-cell
membranes, thus forming chemically self assembled prosthetic antigen receptor (PAR) T-cells. Upon
incubation of the PAR T-cells with EpCAM+ and/or CD133+ cancer cells, rapid and selective killing of primary
and tumor initiating cancer stem cells (CSC) was observed. We have also demonstrated with an orthotopic
murine cancer model that αEpCAM and αCD133 PAR T-cells are non-toxic and able in combination to
eradicate tumors in vivo. A unique safety feature of our approach is the ability to remove the CSANs from the
T-cells by dosing with the FDA-approved non-toxic antibiotic trimethoprim at clinically relevant concentrations,
thus allowing us to deactivate the cells pharmacologically and reduce cytokine release.
 Consequently, as an alternative to current approaches, we determine the generality T-cell induced killing
and eradication of TNBC tumors with αEpCAM/α-CD3-CSANS and αCD133/αCD3-CSANS. In addition, we will
develop a tripspecific αEpCAM/αCD133/αCD3 CSANs that will allow the simultaneous elimination of TNBC
primary tumor cells and CSC. The successful completion of the project milestones should result in the
elucidation of the key features governing a chemical biologically based non-genetic and reversible method for
T-cell targeting, as well as the importance of CD133 on TNBC proliferation. These rules will be applicable to
the clinical development of anti-cancer immunotherapy with greater selectivity, lower toxicity and a reduced
ability for the development of resistance."
10786106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
End stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to diabetes continues to rise despite improvements in glycemic control
and widespread treatment with reno-protective drugs. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms
responsible for the progressive decline in kidney function is urgently needed to identify new, more efficacious
methods of treatment and prevention of ESKD in diabetes. By studying diabetic patients with advanced kidney
disease with proteinuria and CKD≥3, we obtained two novel findings related to progression to ESKD in both T1D
and T2D. Using follow-up data from two independent cohorts and global miRNAs platform, we found a specific
profile of plasma miRNAs strongly associated with progression to ESKD. These miRNAs specifically targeted
axon guidance pathway (AGP) proteins. Strikingly, circulating levels of 6 AGP proteins (two ligands EFNA4,
EFN5 and 4 receptors EPHA2, EPHB2, EPHB6, UNC5C) were very strongly associated with the extent of kidney
structural lesions in the T2D Pima Indian cohort and progression to ESKD in four independent cohorts. Our
findings are the first to implicate circulating AGP proteins in the progression to ESKD in diabetes.
To follow-up these findings, we propose a multi-disciplinary study to assess the role of the AGP proteins in the
development of early progressive kidney functional decline (PKFD) and learn about mechanisms through which
circulating AGP may damage the kidney. Three complementary studies are proposed. Dr. Krolewski’s lab will
examine whether elevated levels of two exemplars of AGP proteins EFNA4 and EPHA2 are associated/causally
related to the development of early PKFD. Dr. Kretzler’s lab will examine how circulating levels of the AGP
proteins may impact candidate etiological pathways in kidney cells. Dr. Korstanje’s lab will examine whether
genetic manipulation of circulating levels of EFNA4 and EPHA2 in mice models of diabetes lead to onset of
diabetic kidney disease. The proposed research has the following specific aims:
Aim #1: We will examine the effect of variation of circulating levels of the candidate miRNAs and AGP proteins
examined at baseline in the two nested cases-control studies of T1D patients with Normo-Alb (n=390) and Micro-
Alb (n=430) on risk of early PKFD during 7-15 years of follow-up. Aim #2: We will examine the link between
circulating levels of the candidate AGP proteins and dysregulation of candidate etiological pathways using single
cell RNA sequencing results obtained from research kidney biopsies from Pima Indians with T2D. Aim #3: We
will test EPHA2 and EFNA4 for their ability to modify renal phenotypes in a diabetic mouse model and test
whether miR-328-5p and miR-339-5p, which are both downregulated during progression to ESKD and have
orthologs in the mouse, can affect the impact of these AGP proteins on diabetic kidney disease.
The proposed research has a very high probability of generating novel findings. Its success is assured by the
fact that the co-investigators have a track record of collaboration, and study cohorts and biobanks of specimens
from all members of the Joslin Kidney Study and Pima Indian Kidney Study are available."

The Puerto Rico BioBank (PRBB) Shared Resource of the Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer
Center (PHSU-MCC) Partnership collects, processes, annotates, stores, and distributes biospecimens and
clinical-demographic data for investigator-initiated translational cancer research. As of August 2022, the PRBB
has consented 4,097 subjects representing 42 different cancer types and healthy individuals. From these
subjects, 1,899 clinical history and demographic surveys were completed and 8,453 biospecimens were
collected. Tissues, derivative analytes (e.g., DNA/RNA), data, and tissue microarrays have been distributed to
research projects supporting publications and grant submissions. The PRBB contributed to the development of
a Biobanking clerkship for medical students in collaboration with the Research Education Core (REC) and
contributed to education efforts in H/L communities in both Tampa and Ponce in collaboration with the Outreach
Core (OC). Together with the Quantitative Sciences Core (QSC), the PRBB has consented 142 H/L patients to
the ORIEN-Avatar network (https://www.oriencancer.org) improving the representation of H/L tissues in this
network, dedicated to accelerating the discovery of novel targeted cancer treatments, that is currently only 7.2%.
The PRBB participates in international consortia including REBLAC (Latin American and Caribbean Biobanking
network), PRACTICAL (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the
Genome), LAGENO-BC (Latin America Genomics of Breast Cancer Consortium), the Latino Colorectal Cancer
Consortium (LC3), the Confluence Project for Breast Cancer Genetics. The objective of the PRBB is to address
the critical unmet need in cancer health disparities of a lack of representation of H/L patients in comprehensive
molecular datasets at levels that align with the prevalence of cancer in this population. The aims are: 1) Support
research projects by targeted recruitment of patients of selected cancer types along with non-cancer controls.
Recruitment is both broad to build a comprehensive database for future projects and focused on the currently
proposed full research projects in prostate and ovarian cancer. We will continue to optimize the logistics of patient
education and consenting at collaborating physician’s offices and San Lucas Hospital (SLH) and by maintaining
constant contact with Project PIs. 2) Support research by developing innovative resources and services. We will
focus on developing new research resources and services that can be rapidly accessed by researchers. This
includes building well-annotated tissue microarrays representing cancer types that significantly impact H/Ls
(prostate, ovarian), expanding molecular phenotyping (exomeSeq, RNAseq, ancestry) in collaboration with
ORIEN, tapping into the potential for identifying clinical trials that are matched to a patient’s molecular profile,
and leverage our emerging expertise in organoid and patient-derived xenografts models to support projects. 3)
Collaborate with partnership components in education, outreach, and community education on the importance
of tissue donation, and improving data availability with the QSC."
10933553,"ABSTRACT | PILOT RESEARCH PROJECT
Transmen (TM) and non-binary individuals (NB; individuals assigned female sex at birth who identify as a man,
male, or another diverse non-binary gender identity on the masculine spectrum) are at higher risk of screening-
detectable cancers. The incidence of cervical cancer among Latinx (a gender-neutral term designating
Hispanics/Latinos (H/L)) is the highest among all ethnic groups in the US. Thus, Latinx TM and NB (LTM-NB)
are at a higher risk for cervical cancer as they lie at the intersection (i.e., gender and ethnic minorities) of two
populations that experience health disparities for this disease. Individual and interpersonal level factors in
interactions with health care providers such as the gendered nature of testing, “misgendering” or use of incorrect
pronouns, and avoidance to discuss issues about body parts associated with their assigned at birth gender have
been identified as some of the key aspects driving cervical cancer disparities among LTM-NB. In addition,
healthcare providers’ negative attitudes and insensitivity can contribute to emotional discomfort for testing,
adding another screening barrier. Our previous studies among LTM-NB in Puerto Rico and Florida show that
providers lack knowledge about specific healthcare needs, have negative stigmatizing attitudes, and manifest
discriminatory behaviors in clinical interactions with LTM-NB. However, although there are existing guidelines to
foster cancer early detection and prevention among TM, no guidelines or interventions address the increased
disparities encountered by ethnic minority LTM-NB. We developed a brief online intervention to improve medical
students’ competencies for cervical cancer education and screening promotion among LTM- NB. The efficacy of
this intervention has already been tested and exhibited medium to large effect sizes. The Aims of this proposed
study are: Aim 1) Test the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing medical students’ knowledge, attitudes,
and skills for providing healthcare to LTM-NB. This will be achieved by conducting a randomized controlled trial
with participants from Ponce Health Science University and from Moffitt Cancer Center-University of South
Florida. Quantitative measures (knowledge and attitudes) and SPS direct observations (behaviors) will be
collected to examine the intervention’s effectiveness. The rationale for this aim is to determine the additional
effect of the measure. Aim 2) Determine the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of implementing the
interventions in real-world medical educational settings. We will implement quantitative self-report measures and
individual interviews with a sub-sample of participants from the experimental condition (n=10) to examine
implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility). The impact of this study will reveal
new effective interventions and implementation strategies. The translational implications of this work will result
in providing medical schools with a cross-cultural tool to train students on cervical cancer prevention for LTM-
NB."
10931550,"ABSTRACT – Pilot Project 5
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies and the survival
rate remains stagnant with a 5-year survival rate of only 5-8%. Black/African Americans (B/AA) individuals
experience the highest prevalence and lowest overall survival rates of PDAC compared to their White
counterparts. FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) is often the preferred
chemotherapy treatment choice for patients with PDAC, but considerable toxicities have limited its use. The
decreased expression of nucleoside transporters due to genetic and epigenetic reasons appeared to account for
Gem resistance. In addition, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which is responsible for Gem phosphorylation into the
active form, is postulated to correlate with Gem efficacy. To address these challenges, we have modified Gem
to 4-(N)- stearoylGem (4NSG) to: i) block the CDA attack on Gem, and ii) increase Gem transport into PDAC
cells. Our recent results revealed highly expressed epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in pancreatic
tumor samples. Guided by our recently published and unpublished results, we hypothesize that optimized 4NSG
nanoparticles with surface-modified anti-EGFR antibody (4NSGnpcetu) will improve the therapeutic efficacy of
Gem. We propose the following specific aims to address this hypothesis. Aim 1: Test the efficacy of 4NSGnpcetu,
in B/AA, and White patient-derived organoid models (PDOs) with stroma and in primary PDAC cells. Aim 2:
Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 4NSGnpcetu in PDAC PDX mouse models bearing subcutaneous tumors from
B/AA and White patients. Aim 3: Measure dCK RNA/protein expression in PDAC PDX tumor models and SNP
genotypes in PDAC cases and controls in the MultiEthnic dataset. Our studies will determine whether racial
differences in dCK variant, gene expression, and protein activity can correlate with improved Gem efficacy in
B/AA and /or White PDAC patients. The valuable information obtained will significantly advance the overall goal
of improving the response and survival rate in PDAC patients."
10759424,"While risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) have been
widely studied, there is still much unknown about the biological pathways that lead to ADRD. This project
seeks to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and ADRD by examining the
role of peripheral immunosenescence in these processes. A major gap in existing research is a lack of
longitudinal studies that can establish an etiologic link between peripheral immunosenescence and
development of incident ADRD. In addition, there are few population-based studies examining these processes
in U.S. representative samples. Population-based studies can evaluate whether clinical findings among ADRD
patients are generalizable to the broader population as well as examine the role of social determinants in these
processes. Despite consistently observed social inequalities in ADRD, including on the basis of race/ethnicity,
sex/gender, and socioeconomic status, the pathways by which social disadvantage lead to ADRD are not well
understood, limiting population-wide ADRD prevention strategies. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the role
of population immunity in predicting ADRD. The overall objective of the current proposal is to evaluate the
relationship between peripheral immunosenescence and domain-specific cognitive function, decline, and
ADRD diagnoses in a nationally representative sample of older US adults, and, to examine the extent to which
immunosenescence explains social inequalities in cognitive function, decline, and ADRD. Our central
hypothesis is that immunosenescence, characterized by an increased number of senescent immune cells
(e.g., CD8+CD45RA-, CD4+CD45RA-) and elevated inflammatory cytokines (C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha) will be associated with worse cognitive outcomes, and that immunosenescence
will partially explain some of the social inequalities in cognitive outcomes. The rationale for the proposed
research is that immunosenescence may be an important early risk factor for ADRD, potentially representing a
biological mechanism explaining population heterogeneity and inequalities in ADRD risk. To investigate these
relationships, we will pursue three specific aims:1) Determine the association between peripheral
immunosenescence and cognitive function and decline in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); 2)
Determine the association between peripheral immunosenescence and incident ADRD measured both by HRS
cognitive assessment and linked Medicare claim data; and 3) Determine the extent to which
immunosenescence explains social inequalities in cognitive function, decline, and ADRD. This proposal is
innovative as it will be the first large-scale population-based study of immunity and cognition. It will yield
critical insights to our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and ADRD, and inequalities in
these processes. This project is significant because the results could point to new diagnostic tools able to
discern profiles of immunosenescence predictive of ADRD in the peripheral blood."

Dr. Clark is an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Baylor College of
Medicine (BCM) and a physician-scientist trained in immunoparasitology. Her career goal is to become an
independent molecular epidemiologist and perform high-quality clinical research that improves the health of
people living in low resource settings. The leading cause of cancer death for women in tropical low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs) is cervical cancer, which is caused by persistent infection with the human
papilloma virus (HPV). Cervical cancer rates are particularly high in LMICs with large intestinal helminth
burdens, and preliminary data show a significant population level association between intestinal helminth
infection and HPV infection. Dr. Clark proposes to evaluate whether intestinal helminth infection facilitates HPV
co-infection by altering the cervico-vaginal environment. She will conduct a cross-sectional study of adult
women undergoing cervical cancer screening in Peru. This innovative study aims to determine the prevalence
of HPV infection, evaluate cervico-vaginal cytokine profiles, and examine the distribution of cervico-vaginal
microbiota in women with and without intestinal helminth infection. Results of this work will suggest novel
interventions that are urgently needed to prevent cervical cancer in women living in LMICs. Dr. Clark’s unique
skill set will allow her to serve as a link between clinical discovery and public health system implementation of
new strategies for cervical cancer prevention. From a public health perspective, if intestinal helminth infection
increases a woman’s risk for HPV infection and therefore cervical cancer, deworming—a widely available, low-
cost intervention—should reduce the cervical cancer rates, thereby increasing the feasibility of cervical cancer
screening program implementation and reducing costs associated with early cervical dysplasia detection and
treatment programs. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Clark has developed a comprehensive career
development plan that combines thorough mentoring and training activities integrated into her clinical research
program. She will have regular meetings with her mentorship team, Dr. Elizabeth Chiao, an authority in virus
mediated malignancies and HPV screening, and Dr. Peter Hotez, a leader in parasitology and global health,
and will receive additional expert-level mentorship from her scientific advisory committee. Mentored research
will be supplemented with formal training activities including graduate-level coursework, directed studies, ad
participation in scientific meetings. Her career development plan is supported by a world-class scientific
environment at BCM, which offers ample opportunities for junior faculty development and provides all the
resources needed to achieve her career goals. The proposed mentored career development activities will
provide the focused mentorship and career development activities that Dr. Clark requires to succeed as an
independently funded molecular epidemiologist conducting high quality, high impact international research."
10759449,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to identify and characterize functional 3’ UTR genetic variants that alter
post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA abundance, with a focus on variants relevant to
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, an increasing number of genetic variants have been
cataloged that confer risks to human diseases, including AD. However, it remains a great
challenge to identify causal variants and elucidate their potential function relevant to disease
pathogenesis and progression. Compared to the progress in pinpointing genetic variants that
alter transcriptional regulation or protein-coding sequences, how genetic variants may affect
post-transcriptional processes is poorly understood. Many of the newly identified AD-associated
variants reside in non-coding regions, such as introns and 3’ UTRs, that may confer regulatory
function to the related gene, especially at the level of post-transcriptional regulation. In particular,
the 3’ UTRs of human genes are enriched with many cis-regulatory elements recognized by
trans-factors, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Together, these cis-elements and
trans-factors dictate many aspects of the mRNA that affect the final expression of a gene. mRNA
abundance of a number of well-known AD-relevant genes are regulated by RBPs or microRNAs
bound to their 3’ UTRs. Genetic variants that affect these regulatory mechanisms will lead to
abnormal mRNA expression, thus significantly altering related functional pathways. In this
project, we will leverage the large collection of public data sets on RBP-RNA interaction profiling,
RNA-seq and genotyping data collected from AD and control subjects, and our in-house data
generation. We will develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets,
complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and high-throughput experimental testing, to
pinpoint 3’ UTR genetic variants that alter mRNA abundance in AD. This work will allow a
previously unattained level of understanding of genetic variants in post-transcriptional regulation
and provide new means to tackle the imperative task of functional interpretation of genetic
variants in AD."

10929496,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – OUTREACH CORE
The Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s geographic area is
composed of San Diego and Imperial Counties, the two U.S.-Mexico border counties in California which
include ~3.5 million residents. This region is a majority-minority area, with extensive cultural, linguistic, and
racial/ethnic diversity. Disparities in cancer risk factors, screening, treatment and survivorship continue to
persist nationally and within the Partnership’s region, particularly among underserved groups. Generally,
medically underserved individuals are diagnosed with cancer at a later stage and have poorer survival
compared to individuals who are more affluent. Reducing these cancer disparities requires capacity
development for evidence-based practice and community-engaged research and practice dissemination. There
is also a need for greater engagement and training of researchers from under-represented backgrounds to
collaborate with community organizations that serve this population. Further, communities rarely have
opportunities to develop research programs and implement evidence-based practices in collaboration with
expert clinicians and researchers. Using innovative approaches that are integrated into all Partnership
components, the Outreach Core addresses these gaps through its overarching goal: To integrate community
engagement principles into all CREATE Partnership activities. To accomplish this, the Outreach Core will
adopt the Community-to-Bench model, which provides an intentional effort to ensure community engagement
and bi-directional dialogue. The following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Advance cancer health equity by
facilitating and supporting catchment area-relevant research and community-engaged research including but
not limited to Partnership-sponsored research projects; 2) Provide support to community health centers for
screening, early detection, linkage to care and referral pathways; 3) Foster community engagement by
conducting needs assessments, disseminating evidence-based practices and resources and implementing
educational and outreach activities; and 4) Contribute to the Partnership’s educational mission by providing
educational opportunities to undergraduate, graduate and medical students, as well as early-stage
investigators in areas of community-engaged research and cancer disparities. Working closely with the
Community Advisory Board, the OC will build upon existing community partnerships to further expand the
Partnership’s outreach activities with underserved communities and to support research in catchment area
priority cancers. To conduct this work, the Core has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in
cancer disparities research, prevention, multilevel interventions, and community health system interventions.
The Core’s collaborative approach is responsive to community needs and will improve cancer health equity in
the Partnership’s region and beyond."
10761744,"After a tissue is infected, the invading pathogen must be controlled and the tissue must be repaired or
else long-term morbidity and mortality will ensue. Toxoplasma gondii infections result in a
non-resolving chronic infection with tissue cysts residing preferentially in skeletal muscle and the
central nervous system. In contrast to the brain little is known about the immune response and
immune-regulation in the infected muscle. Foxp3-expressing CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a
key role in controlling the immune response to infection and aid in tissue repair. Yet, we have found
during chronic T. gondii infection muscle Tregs become pathogenic and cause inflammation instead
of preventing it. We have shown these Tregs are Th1-polarized but do not produce IFNγ. Tregs in T.
gondii-infected muscle produce low levels of amphiregulin, a cytokine critical in repairing
immune-mediated pathology. We showed that Toxoplasma-induced immunopathology in muscle can
be ameliorated by recombinant treatment with amphiregulin in chronically infected mice and returning
function to the tissue. However it is unclear how amphiregulin mediates this effect. The overarching
hypothesis for this proposal is that T-bet expression in skeletal muscle Tregs drives this pathogenic
function by dampening production of key factors associated with normally suppressive Treg function.
This hypothesis will be addressed in the following specific aims: (1) identify how T-bet drives the
pathogenic function of Tregs in infected muscle and (2) define the role of amphiregulin in infected
muscle during Toxoplasma infection. How a chronic infection alters the highly orchestrated
immune-mediated regeneration of muscle is still poorly understood. Loss of muscle mass predicts
reduced quality of life and often increased morbidity for chronically ill patients and so a better
understanding of what drives this process is needed for directing therapeutic interventions."
10744263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In the weeks following myocardial infarction, damaged tissue undergoes a structural change, where myocytes
are broken down and removed, and collagenous tissue is restructured. This structural change impairs the tissue's
ability to resist internal pressures and if left untreated can lead to aneurysmal growth, ischemic mitral regurgi-
tation, and ultimately heart failure. Polymer injection therapy has been clinically shown to reduce post-infarct
left-ventricle cardiac wall remodeling, but the development of this treatment thus far has been largely experimen-
tal. Optimal therapy parameters, both for generic treatment and for individual patients are currently unknown.
 Our objective for this proposal is to develop an experimentally guided computational model of left ventricle
remodeling that incorporates heart-speciﬁc imaging data, which will enable us to systematically optimize the
polymer injection therapy by examining the impact of treatment parameters such as injection volume, site density,
and polymer stiffness. This heart-speciﬁc imaging data will allow us to determine the effect of individual infarct
geometry and myocardium microstructure, and to tailor treatment to individual cases. We also seek to use this
image data to validate the long term predictions of this model, demonstrating that it can predict the remodeling
that occurs, and the impact of different polymer injection conﬁgurations. Therefore, it will serve to preemptively
consider multiple treatment options so clinicians can choose the best course of action for individual patients.
 The objectives of this proposal are summarized in the three following speciﬁc aims:
SA1. Model post-infarct tissue remodeling matching established ovine MI model progression
SA2. Validate in a heart-speciﬁc pipeline at the tissue and organ levels
SA3. Utilize the previously generated model to optimize polymer injection treatment protocol"

10766167,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The University of Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) conducts a robust two-stage review for rigorous internal
oversight of the scientific aspects of all cancer clinical studies.
The First stage review is via Disease Teams that are involved in trial selection, implementation, study
coordination, and data management. Each disease team consists of disease-focused clinical research
investigators (MD and PhD) and study staff involved in the development and conduct of clinical studies. Each
disease team defines their clinical research priorities. The first stage review by disease teams helps eliminate
many trials from moving forward in the start-up and implementation process.
Second stage review is via the UVACC Protocol Review and Monitoring System, which oversees and ensures
the scientific merit, priorities, and progress of all cancer clinical studies conducted at the UVACC. A Protocol
Review Committee (PRC), appointed by the UVACC Director and administratively supported by the Office for
Clinical Research, has been given the authority and charge to carry out this mandate.
The PRC is chaired by Ryan Gentzler, MD. Its primary goal is to ensure that investigator-initiated and industry-
initiated cancer research studies involving human subjects conducted at the UVACC are: (1) scientifically and
statistically sound; (2) appropriately designed; (3) feasible for completion; and (4) in compliance with NIH
guidelines for human studies.
The PRC also plays an important role in mediating competing studies by requiring adherence to an institutional
prioritization plan and patient availability, and closely monitors the clinical trial progress and rules for
termination of studies in the UVACC based upon accrual and continued scientific relevance."
11027805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can withstand treatment with bactericidal
antibiotics even when lacking identifiable resistance genes. It is thought that these recalcitrant infections are
attributable to phenotypically antibiotic-tolerant cells called persisters. Despite the acknowledged contribution of
P. aeruginosa to chronic and recurrent infections, there is a lack of basic research into cellular mechanisms that
underlie P. aeruginosa antibiotic persistence. My central hypotheses in this research proposal are that the
cellular responses following treatment will govern P. aeruginosa antibiotic persistence and resistance
development (Aim 1), and that increased duration of coexistence with common co-isolate, S. aureus, will
increase P. aeruginosa persistence by priming it in a more stress-tolerant state (Aim 2). This fellowship research
will provide critical insight into persister physiology as well as the opportunity to learn cutting-edge techniques,
analyses, and skills that will prepare me to lead independent research efforts in the future as a dentist-scientist
interested in bacteria of the oral cavity.
 In Aim 1, I will investigate how P. aeruginosa persisters reawaken after drug treatment. I will perform RNA-
seq to screen for genes that are differentially expressed between untreated cultures and cells that are viable
after antibiotic treatment. Hits from this screen will be functionally validated by conducting persister assays with
multiple genetic models for the genes of interest, including transcriptional reporters, knockout mutants, and
inducible complementation strains. Significant genes of interest will be tested in biofilm cultures and in host-
mimicking media to add clinical relevance. In Aim 2, I will determine how the duration of co-culture with S. aureus
affects P. aeruginosa persistence and the physiologies of surviving cells. To efficiently passage and assay P.
aeruginosa in co-culture, I am implementing a novel, dual-chambered apparatus that I designed, called the “H-
Cell.” The H-Cell allows dynamic crosstalk between species while maintaining segregated populations for
efficient sampling. I will determine the transcriptomic changes between P. aeruginosa persisters grown in
monoculture or in H-Cell co-culture with S. aureus by RNA-seq. I will validate the hits by testing genetic
constructs. Furthermore, I will test P. aeruginosa persistence in strains that are co-isolated with S. aureus from
clinical sputum samples and thus have co-existed in a host environment.
 From my use of multiple bacterial strains, antimicrobials, and culture conditions, I aim to reveal the
generalizability or specificity of P. aeruginosa persistence mechanisms and how they contribute to the
development of antibiotic resistant progeny. Furthermore, I can apply the investigative approach, technical skills,
and tools that I develop throughout this proposal to my future research on bacterial physiology in multispecies
communities of the oral cavity. Altogether, completion of this research can inspire anti-persister strategies to
reduce the burden of recalcitrant infections and their contributions to the broader antibiotic resistance crisis."

Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly prevalent, but significantly
understudied comorbidity that negatively impacts quality of life for individuals with SCI. Increasing evidence
suggests impaired vagal activity is a primary cause of upper GI dysfunction after injury. Under normal
conditions, gastric reflexes are coordinated by the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve contains both afferent fibers that
convey sensory information to central structures and efferent fibers that carry motor output needed for gastric
contractions. Previous work in our lab has demonstrated that following injury, vagal afferents are significantly
less responsive to chemical stimuli, including the gut peptide ghrelin. Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that
normally serves to decrease vagal afferent activity and increase gastric motility by binding to the growth hormone
secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a), a G protein-coupled receptor, expressed along the vagal afferents. The cellular
mechanisms underlying ghrelin’s ability to modulate vagal afferent activity in both healthy and disease states
have yet to be fully elucidated. This proposal will utilize an animal model of SCI combined with molecular and
imaging techniques, in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology, and in vivo nerve recordings to identify mechanisms
underlying the loss of vagal sensitivity post-SCI. The proposed experiments will investigate the central
hypothesis that GHSR1a-mediated inhibition of calcium currents is dysregulated in gastric-projecting nodose
ganglia neurons after SCI. Based upon our preliminary observations, we will test the hypothesis with two specific
aims. Aim 1 will determine the precise mechanism underlying GHSR1a modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+
channels (CaV2.2 or N-type) in gastric-projecting vagal afferent neurons of naïve rats using whole-cell patch-
clamp electrophysiology. Aim 2 will utilize immunohistochemistry, single-cell quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), electrophysiological techniques, and in vivo nerve recordings to identify
whether the GHSR1a-mediated effects of ghrelin on N-type Ca2+ channel currents and gastric vagal afferent
excitability are dysregulated following SCI. This proposal will provide critical information regarding how changes
to GPCR-mediated inhibition of CaV channels impairs gastric vagal afferent activity following injury. In addition,
the proposed work will benefit future studies investigating the use of ghrelin mimetics to treat gastric dysmotility
associated with a broad range of conditions including SCI, diabetes mellitus, and obesity."

The causes of most non-syndromic structural birth defects remain unknown due to their complex causes where
genetic and environmental factors (GxE) interact to cause disease. Understanding how GxE converges to
alter embryonic development is critical for devising preventive strategies to reduce risks. Recent work by the
Zohn laboratory established a new mouse model to study the mechanisms underlying GxE interactions and
congenital heart defects (CHDs). Extensive preliminary studies with this mouse model led us to formulate our
central hypotheses: GxE converges to alter gene expression in cardiac progenitor cells to alter cell fate, and
different genetic variants in critical genes can have divergent effects on GxE interactions.
We propose two Specific Aims that use our GxE mouse models to illuminate how GxE interacts to cause
CHDs. Our experimental design involves altering the vitamin A content of the maternal diet (Environmental
factor) in mice carrying a mutation in Hectd1 (Genetic factor), a novel ubiquitin ligase discovered in the Zohn
laboratory. We show that while neither heterozygous mutation of Hectd1 nor mild vitamin A deficiency results
in CHDs, the combination of the two causes CHDs. Mechanistically we demonstrate that Hectd1 is required for
vitamin A/retinoic acid signaling, yet how HECTD1 regulates signaling remains unknown.
The aims of this project are 1) to determine how GxE converges to cause CHDs in our model and 2) to
elucidate how HECTD1 regulates retinoic acid signaling utilizing an allelic series of truncated HECTD1 mouse
lines that model human CHD-associated mutations. Interestingly, our preliminary studies indicate that distinct
mutations in HECTD1 disrupt retinoic acid signaling differently.
Successful completion of these aims will: 1) provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of how GXE interacts
to cause CHDs by elucidating which critical developmental processes are disrupted in our GxE model; 3)
reveal how HECTD1 regulates RA signaling; and 4) link our animal studies to human disorders by modeling
patient mutations in mouse models and determining how these mutations differentially interact with maternal
vitamin A intake. These studies will reveal the mechanisms of how GxE interaction alters the development of
the heart and pinpoint critical targets for preventing birth defects."

 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects approximately 10% of adults above the age of 40
and is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide. Comorbid diseases commonly accompany COPD and are
important determinants of COPD outcomes. In addition, exercise capacity and physical activity are strong
independent predictors of all-cause mortality in COPD patients. The two important determinants of exercise
capacity are hemoglobin level, the limiting factor for oxygen carrying capacity, and iron level, which dictates
tissue oxidative capacity. Thus, while iron deficiency and anemia are related, they are distinct conditions with
differing mechanisms of pathophysiology. Currently, compared to anemia, less is known regarding the
association between iron deficiency and COPD morbidity. In limited observational and retrospective clinical
studies, iron deficiency has been shown to be associated with self-reported exacerbations, worse exercise
tolerance, and increased severity of chronic lung disease-associated pulmonary hypertension. Regarding
treatment, there have been proof-of-concept studies showing improvement in exercise capacity with IV iron
repletion in small cohorts of COPD patients. However, given the small scale of the studies thus far, it remains
unknown whether all COPD patients are affected similarly by iron deficiency and whether iron repletion will
provide equal benefit.
 The main object of this proposal is to understand the association between iron profile and COPD morbidity
through two novel aims. First, to determine the association between iron profile, specifically ferritin and
transferrin saturation, and COPD-related hospitalization by conducting a retrospective secondary analysis
of a large COPD patient data registry with approximately 85,000 individuals. Second, to prospectively
determine the association between iron profile and 2a) hospital readmission rate and 2b) functional
status by physical activity level, in a cohort of patients recently hospitalized for COPD exacerbations.
The second aim will be nested in an observational cohort study of patients recently hospitalized for COPD
exacerbations that is enriched for exacerbation events. We will obtain iron profiles at 1-week post-index
hospitalization and the cohort will be followed for 12 months with regular interval in-person or telephone
assessments for exacerbations and validated respiratory symptom measures. Physical activity level will be
acquired through step count and heart rate monitoring. This proposal provides an excellent training vehicle for
patient-oriented clinical research through hands on experience following a cohort from enrollment to final
analysis. I will also develop expertise in basic large data management and physical activity data acquisition
and analysis. If we find that iron deficiency is associated with COPD morbidity, future investigation of treatment
with iron repletion and assessment of benefit versus harm would be warranted, and would serve as the
foundation for my future K-level career development award."

Despite the central role of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (CaP) progression, insights into the specific
molecular mechanisms by which AR controls the cellular processes that drive CaP progression remain largely
elusive. Lack of this knowledge is an important problem, because without it, development of novel therapeutic
approaches that target specifically AR-dependent events underlying the lethal phenotype is unlikely. The long-
term goal is to understand how the mechanism(s) by which AR controls clinically relevant gene expression in
CaP cells can be manipulated for therapeutic intervention. The objective here is to determine the therapeutic
potential of disrupting AR-responsive PKN1-SRF interactions. The central hypothesis is that targeting PKN1
will prevent CaP progression mediated by AR-responsive SRF action. This hypothesis is formulated based on
preliminary work produced in the applicant's laboratory. The rationale for the proposed studies is that, once it is
understood how AR regulation of SRF action in CaP occurs, select targeting of AR action that is relevant to
disease progression will be possible. The central hypothesis is tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) determine
the role of PKN1 in the AR-responsive SRF transcriptional complex; 2) define the substrate for PKN1's kinase
action in the AR-dependent SRF transcriptional complex; and 3) determine therapeutic potential of targeting AR-
responsive PKN1-SRF interactions. Aim 1 will determine the impact of genetic or pharmacological inactivation
of PKN1 on the composition and function of AR-dependent SRF complex at target genes using a combination of
RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq assays. In Aim 2, state-of-the-art biotin-based proximity ligation assays
and mass spectrometry in CaP models that express wild-type or kinase-dead PKN1 or in which PKN1 action is
pharmacologically inhibited will define PKN1-dependent phosphorylation of SRF, the SRF transcriptional
complex and its chromatin environment. Aim 3 will determine the therapeutic potential of inhibiting PKN1-SRF
interactions in clinically relevant PDXs and fresh ex vivo explants of CaP tissue obtained from patients. Clinically
applicable biomarkers of response to such treatment will be sought using gene expression and proximity ligation
assays. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on an entirely different approach to target AR
action in CaP: unraveling and targeting an AR-dependent signaling pathway downstream of AR that controls the
expression of genes that are relevant for CaP progression. This contribution is significant because is it the first
step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development of novel treatment modalities that
target specifically AR-mediated gene expression that underlies the lethal CaP phenotype. With respect to
expected outcomes, the proposed studies will identify the molecular mechanisms by which PKN1 introduces a
therapeutic vulnerability in the AR-PKN1-SRF signaling cascade that gives rise to the aggressive CaP
phenotype. These results will have an important positive impact because they will fundamentally advance
knowledge about AR action in CaP, in general, and provide new targets for CaP therapy, specifically."
10754237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Spina bifida is the most common permanently disabling birth defect in the USA; myelomeningocele (MMC)
is the most severe form. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in affected children and is a risk factor
for sudden death in this population. Abnormal sleep physiology is likely multifactorial for children with MMC,
related to the level of spinal defect, presence of congenital and acquired brainstem abnormalities,
musculoskeletal factors, and pulmonary abnormalities. Yet, systematic assessment for SDB is not routine.
 Fetal surgery to close the spinal defect is a major advance in MMC therapy. Fetal surgery improves motor
development and can reduce the need for ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts by diminishing hindbrain herniation,
but cognitive outcomes are not improved compared with post-natal MMC repair (mean Bayley-II mental
development index scores ~1SD lower than normal controls at age 30 months) and persistent executive
function deficits are common later in childhood. The effect of fetal MMC repair on sleep pathophysiology
remains unknown. Meanwhile, emerging evidence suggests that for otherwise healthy children even mild
symptoms of SDB during infancy, such as parent-reported snoring, identify long-term risk for adverse
neurobehavioral consequences, including subtle cognitive deficits. Thus, the premise of this proposal is that
SDB is a potentially remediable contributor to the abnormal cognitive outcomes for children with MMC.
 Innovative preliminary work by the investigators suggests that SDB is ubiquitous among newborns with
MMC regardless of the timing of surgical repair. We recruited twenty newborns with MMC for neonatal
polysomnography (5 fetal repair and 15 post-natal repair). All of these neonates had SDB, with no difference
between those who received fetal vs. post-natal repair. We now have a unique opportunity to leverage the
existing infrastructure of the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet) for a multicenter observational
study that will have direct impact on clinical practice through the following specific aims – Aim 1: Determine
whether fetal vs. post-natal MMC repair at NAFTNet centers influences neonatal SDB; Aim 2: Define the
association between neonatal SDB, objective measures of sleep physiology, timing of MMC surgery, and
neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 2 years for patients with MMC; Aim 3: Assess whether fetal vs. post-
natal MMC repair influences the risk for persistent SDB at age 2 years.
 Evaluation of sleep in neonates who require intensive care is an innovative, emerging opportunity with
potential for major impact on health and quality of life for affected children. This study will be the first of its kind
and could pave the way for a significant shift in clinical practice, to include routine screening of newborns with
MMC for SDB as part of a new standard of care. Results of this work will inform future intervention studies
designed to determine the most effective approach to treatment of SDB as a strategy to optimize long-term
medical and neurodevelopmental outcomes."

 Natalie Jayaram, MD MSB is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas
City and a faculty member in the Department of Pediatrics and Division of Cardiology at Children’s Mercy
Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. As a pediatric cardiologist and health services researcher, her long-term
career goals are to improve the care of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) by contributing
to the science of quality assessment, by examining the effectiveness of policy-based initiatives on care, and by
partnering directly with patients to facilitate changes in care. The goal of the current project is to study public
reporting for congenital heart surgery (CHS). Public reporting is designed to provide healthcare consumers
with outcome data for a given provider or institution. Proponents of public reporting advocate for transparent
disclosure of health outcomes data and contend that public reporting results in improved outcomes.1-4 Critics of
public reporting cite evidence that public reporting may not substantially improve outcomes and could result in
unintended consequences, including risk avoidance practices.5-14 Formal study regarding the impact of public
reporting on outcomes for CHS has never been performed. The highly specialized nature of CHD care, with
relatively less local or regional competition compared to more prevalent conditions (e.g. adult cardiovascular
disease) but with patients willing to travel to seek the ‘best’ care,15 suggest that public reporting for CHS
warrants independent investigation. The primary aims of the proposed project are: 1) to evaluate whether, as
an unintended consequence of public reporting, there is a shift in patient case mix, suggesting that centers
could be avoiding surgical intervention in patients at highest risk for poor outcome 2) to evaluate the
association between implementation of public reporting for CHS and surgical outcomes, and 3) to better
understand the type and format of data that CHD patients and families would find most meaningful to help
them make informed decisions regarding care. Study aims 1 and 2 of the project propose obtaining data from
the State Inpatient Database in order to study the association between public reporting, institutional case mix,
and surgical outcomes at centers throughout the US performing CHS. Study Aim 3 proposes focus groups
involving CHD patients and caregivers to gain an improved understanding of their preferences with regards to
public reporting. Together with her mentorship team, Dr. Jayaram has worked to create a career development
plan that will provide her with additional training, education, and experience in the areas of advanced statistical
methodology, experience in working with administrative data, and formal training in qualitative research and
patient engagement. Overall, the skills learned from this project and educational plan coupled with an
outstanding mentorship team will allow Dr. Jayaram to achieve her ultimate goal of becoming an independent
investigator and leader in the field of pediatric cardiovascular outcomes research."
10754240,"Although hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been extensively studied in transplantation and cancer, immunological properties of the HSC niche have remained largely unexplored. The testis and placenta act as immunological sanctuaries for embryonic and germline stem cells, and are termed immune privileged sites. In these tissues, allogeneic (allo-) or xenogeneic grafts persist long-term, even without immune suppressive therapy. Little is known about whether tissue-committed stem cell niches are broadly immune privileged. Our current R01 has tested whether the HSC niche within the bone marrow (BM) acts as an immune privileged site that shields both allo-HSCs and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) from immune attack. We have demonstrated that distinctly activated niche-residential FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) render such HSCs immune privileged. Such niche Tregs enable the persistence of allo-HSCs in non-conditioned immune competent mice, while promoting engraftment. Niche Tregs also shield LSCs, leading to therapeutic resistance. To discover further fundamental insights into immune privilege, this R01 renewal application proposes the following extensions of study to characterize: A) niche Tregs; B) highly immune-privileged, highly primitive HSCs/LSCs, amongst other stem cells; and C) highly immunoprotective niches, amongst other HSC niche locations. There has remained a long-standing controversy as to whether the HSC niche localizes at BM sinusoids, arterioles, or the bone surface. This controversy may be at least partially explained by potential heterogeneity in HSCs. We expect that immune privilege identifies the top of the hierarchy within heterogenous HSCs and niches. The proposal will decipher the crosstalk among niche Tregs, highly immune-privileged HSCs/LSCs, and highly immunoprotective niches, and define their roles in allo-HSC transplantation and in leukemia. Our wok will further develop new therapies to manipulate or transfer these linked key players in immune privilege to promote allo-HSC engraftment or to overcome therapeutic resistance in leukemia."
10910882,"Pollution is the leading environmental cause of premature death and disease globally, yet only a
fraction of the hundreds of thousands of chemicals in production have undergone safety testing. To
solve this problem, the long-term goal is to develop advanced, predictive toxicity testing to transform
environmental health protection.
The overall objective of this proposal is to use a groundbreaking
population-sequencing approach to harness the natural genetic diversity of wild C. elegans in
combination with functional genomics approaches to identify the structure-activity relationships of
poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The central hypothesis is that underlying genetic
variation will result in variation in response to PFAS exposures, which will identify unique molecular
mechanisms of toxicity across PFAS that vary in three structural properties: chain length, chain
composition, and functional group. The rationale is that generating toxicity data to regulate the
>12,000 individual PFAS chemicals currently in production is impractical, but identification of
structure-activity relationships of PFAS is likely to contribute to improved risk assessment and
regulation of PFAS. The central hypothesis will be tested using three specific aims: 1) Determine the
contribution of genetic architecture on PFAS toxicity in wild C. elegans; 2) Identify the effects of
PFAS structure on gene regulation; and 3) Identify genomic variants that confer sensitivity and
resistance to PFAS exposures. For the first aim, 192 wild strains of C. elegans will be used in a
pooled-population, selection and sequencing approach to determine the contribution of natural
genetic variation in response to exposures and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are
associated with specific structural features of PFAS. For the second aim, ATAC-sequencing and
mRNA-sequencing will be conducted in laboratory, wild-type (N2) C. elegans following exposures to
the same PFAS chemicals to identify gene-regulatory mechanisms involved in response to
exposures and shared and unique responses based on each molecular attribute. For the third aim,
candidate gene variants will be prioritized and tested for causality (structure-specific sensitivities)
using genome editing and phenotypic analysis. This proposal is innovative because it uses a multi-
omics approach to identify causal gene variants and regulatory pathways to reveal specific structure-
activity signatures of PFAS toxicity. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to
contribute to improved risk assessments through the identification of novel mechanisms of PFAS
toxicity and structure-activity relationships. Ultimately, the i
dentification of genes and molecular
mechanisms that mediate response to PFAS exposures provides the opportunity to extrapolate
across chemicals that share molecular attributes for improved regulation to promote healthier lives."

Cancer cells must employ a telomere lengthening mechanism to ensure replicative immortality. 15% of cancer
cells utilize Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT), a homologous recombination-mediated pathway.
Perturbation of the ALT mechanism can be achieved by disruption of enzymes involved in ADP-ribosylation, a
post-translational modification that regulates several cellular processes including transcription, metabolism, and
DNA repair. The pharmacological inhibition of enzymes involved in ADP-ribosylation has proven to be of
immense biomedical value in cancer therapy. Over the last 30 years, studies have primarily built on intensive
investigation of ADP-ribosylation as a modification that is exclusively found on proteins. Yet, new evidence is
emerging that nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are direct and perhaps even the predominant sources of ADP-
ribosylation, especially in the aftermath of DNA damage. This paradigm shift has major implications for our
understanding of the physiological function of ADP-ribosylation in ALT. Thus, improving our knowledge of the
cellular targets and mechanisms of this new DNA modification will be vital for the development of enhanced
ADP-ribose-targeting therapeutics that achieve better clinical outcomes for ALT cancer patients.
 I found that telomeres, specialized structures at the ends of the chromosomes, are targets of the major
ADP-ribosylation enzymes; Poly ADP-ribose Polymerase (PARP1), Poly ADP-ribose Glycohydrolase (PARG),
and a newly identified factor known as Terminal ADP-ribose Hydrolase (TARG1). I uncovered that PARP1
coordinates the ADP-ribosylation of telomeric DNA sequences and that TARG1, acting in conjunction with
PARG, is responsible for the removal ADP-ribose from telomeric DNA. Furthermore, I show that the disruption
of TARG1 expression provokes replicative complications at ALT telomeres that may have catastrophic
consequences for cancer cell viability. In Aim 1, I will further assess the impact of DNA ADP-ribosylation and
defects in factors that regulate its removal on telomere function and ALT. In Aim 2, I will dissect the impact of
co-suppression of TARG1 and PARG, factors that regulate DNA ADP-ribosylation, on cancer cell viability, and
the contribution of telomere dysfunction therein. This study will provide new and crucial knowledge on the novel
and fundamental role of ADP-ribosylation in ALT. By exploring the impact that its deregulation has on ALT, this
study will contribute new insights into how the deregulation of ADP-ribosylation contributes to cancer treatment."

The AIDS research portfolio at Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) has continued to expand
as demonstrated by a peak growth of approximately $6.5 million dollars (30% increase) in nonhuman primate
(NHP) AIDS research grant funding over the past eight years. This growth in grant funding is accompanied by
a high demand for Indian-origin specific pathogen free (SPF) rhesus macaques as the animal model for this
research. YNPRC has continued to maintain a colony of SPF rhesus macaques to provide these animals for
HIV/AIDS research. This application requests continued support to expand the SPF colony by maximizing
production. The application includes the Overview; Husbandry and Management Core; the Viral Testing Core;
and the MHC Genetic Typing Core (Colony Genetics). This grant will support a subset of the overall YNPRC
SPF colony and will derive program income from animal assignment fees and per diems. YNPRC will provide
institutional support to cover remaining expenses for this colony as well as the remainder of the SPF colony.
Management and Husbandry: To leverage the resources provided by the U42 to maximize production of
Indian-origin rhesus monkeys and facilitate allocation of these animals for NIH-funded HIV/AIDS research
Viral Testing: To provide serological and molecular viral diagnostic testing in support of the SPF colony and to
maintain a colony free of diseases that impact AIDS-related research at the Yerkes NPRC
Colony Genetics: To provide parentage testing, comprehensive analysis of MHC class I and class II alleles,
and to develop new techniques for detailed genetic characterization to support a genetically healthy breeding
colony and provide genetic information on animals essential to the animal assignment process in support of
AIDS research.
Achieving these aims will ensure the Yerkes NPRC SPF breeding program is sustainable, providing the
necessary animals to support the HIV/AIDS research program using Indian-origin rhesus monkeys. The
availability of this critical resource to scientists performing preclinical studies using the rhesus monkey model
will have a positive, significant impact on the development of treatments to prevent or cure infection from HIV
in people."

Individuals with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at high risk for rapid
functional decline and hospitalization. Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the few interventions that has been
shown to effectively modify the course of COPD and improve health outcomes; however, challenges in
implementation and access to this high resource intervention in real-life settings have led to low-availability and
engagement due to both healthcare system-level and patient-level barriers. To address barriers specific to low-
resourced healthcare settings, we developed COPD Wellness with patient and clinical stakeholders. This 10-
week community-based program retains key elements of pulmonary rehabilitation (exercise training, self-
management, and peer social support), but is designed to be portable and feasible to deliver in diverse settings.
While COPD Wellness addresses many system-level barriers, it does not directly address patient-level barriers.
Lower levels of adherence are common across low-income, low health literacy communities, reflecting the
burden of competing socio-environmental stressors that interfere with the ability to carry out rehabilitation
activities and independently contribute to poor outcomes in COPD. We adapted the evidence-based resource
support program, Health Advocates (HA), for the unmet social needs of older patients with COPD as a strategy
to improve acceptance, adherence, and impact of pulmonary rehabilitation programs (Plus+).
The proposed study will directly test the benefit of the COPD Wellness and Plus+ Program relative to usual care
and estimate the added benefit of the HA in COPD Wellness Plus+ to COPD Wellness alone in a three-arm,
randomized waitlist-controlled trial conducted in three geographically isolated urban primary care sites that
provide care for some of the most socially vulnerable patient populations with COPD. In this Type 1 effectiveness-
implementation hybrid design, we aim to 1) determine the effectiveness of COPD Wellness and Plus+ to improve
functional and symptom outcomes; and, using a mixed-methods approach 2) to evaluate the implementation of
COPD Wellness and Plus+ across study sites applying the RE-AIM and CFIR frameworks to identify additional
barriers and enablers of intervention implementation and patient acceptance and adherence. COPD Wellness
Plus+ was designed to specifically address barriers to rehabilitation and function within low-resourced healthcare
settings. If effective, the COPD Wellness Plus+ program can offer a feasible pathway for broader implementation
of low intensity pulmonary rehabilitation regionally and nationally in the U.S."

It is estimated that around 40% of the adult population of the United States is obese and thus at increased risk
for several chronic illnesses. Current weight loss strategies for obese people are often ineffective and come
with serious neurological side effects. This proposal aims to determine whether new strategies to treat and
prevent obesity can be developed from current insights into biological aging.
The transcription factor C/EBP-β regulates the expression of genes involved in fat catabolism and fat stores
mobilization. Preliminary observations suggest that pro-longevity interventions, such as mTORC1 inhibition,
prevent diet-induced obesity in mice and activate C/EBP-β. The nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase
inhibitor (NRTI) adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) also prevents diet-induced obesity and activates C/EBP-β, though
independently of mTORC1 inhibition.
Building on these premises, Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that activation of hepatic C/EBP-β leads to increased
energy expenditure and fat catabolism, with net negative effects on weight and fat stores. Using transgenics
and pharmacological approaches, we will determine the role of hepatic C/EBP-β in lipid metabolism and
homeostasis in the face of obesogenic challenges and morbid obesity. State-of-the-art techniques will be
applied to measure the impact of different isoforms of C/EBP-β on energy balance, glucose homeostasis, and
endocrine regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.
Aim 2 sets out to determine whether mitohormetic stresses can increase lipid metabolism through activation of
C/EBP-β. Using ADV and other mitochondrial stressors, we will measure activation of mitohormetic pathways
and their connection with increased hepatic oxidation of fatty acids and energy expenditure.
This proposal will be carried out in an institution with strong research programs in both aging and
obesity/diabetes biology. The candidate will receive state of the art training in techniques and analytical tools
necessary to the completion of both aims, including indirect calorimetry, insulin and glucose tolerance testing,
and big data analysis. The candidate will also acquire an in-depth background in energy and nutrient
homeostasis. Altogether, the experiments and training proposed will allow the candidate to build an
independent and successful research program applying insights from geroscience to understand and
investigate nutrient homeostasis, energy balance, and related metabolic disorders."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children and the
leading cause for hospitalization of infants. A subset of RSV-infected children develops severe protracted lung
inflammation that leads to respiratory failure and even death but effective therapies for RSV are lacking. Our
preliminary data for this proposal implicates a role for NK cells in the pathobiology of RSV infection. We have
determined that NK cells are abundant in the airways of RSV-infected children with profound hypoxemia and
that NK cell cytotoxicity is impaired in pediatric RSV. NK cells are pivotal mediators of innate viral immunity and
are also key cellular effectors of inflammation resolution to clear inflamed tissues of virus-infected and
activated cells through immune synapse formation and lytic granule delivery to trigger targeted apoptosis.
Disrupted inflammation resolution can perpetuate tissue damage and chronic inflammation; hence, NK cell
resolution function is critical to prevent protracted lung inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is an active
process mediated in part by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), a family of endogenous fatty acid-
derived molecules that counter inflammatory signals and accelerate resolution through cell-specific actions. We
recently identified that SPMs mitigate RSV-induced lung inflammation in mice, but whether RSV impacts SPM
resolution pathways in humans remains unknown. In preliminary data for this proposal we identify for the first
time that NK cells in human RSV express receptors for the SPMs resolvin D2, resolvin E1, and lipoxin A4. We
have determined that the SPM lipoxin A4 up-regulates NK cell cytoskeletal proteins to promote lytic granule
trafficking and augment cytotoxicity, distinct from steroids that disrupt NK cell cytoskeletal dynamics and impair
cytotoxicity. This proposal will test our central hypothesis that RSV infection alters airway and circulating NK
cell immunophenotype and disrupts cytoskeletal signaling pathways to impede NK cell resolution functions that
can be restored by exogenous SPMs. To test this hypothesis in pediatric RSV+ ICU patients, we will pursue the
following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine NK cell immunophenotypes and effector functions in pediatric RSV
infection; Aim 2: Define mechanisms for disrupted lytic granule trafficking that governs NK cell cytotoxicity; and
Aim 3: Establish circuits of defective inflammation resolution linked with pediatric RSV infection. This proposal
brings an innovative approach to the study of RSV by leveraging human pediatric biospecimens to determine
a novel NK cell–SPM immunoregulatory axis and utilizes cutting-edge mechanistic immunology techniques to
identify and probe novel targets in RSV. This proposal has relevance to public health as an unprecedented
post-pandemic surge of pediatric RSV infection is currently overwhelming hospitals and pediatric ICUs and
identifying new immune targets for potential therapeutic or preventative strategies is urgently needed."

This Ruth Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) training Program proposes to take primarily
surgeons during the second or third year of their general residency programs, and expose them to two to four
years of mentored research with highly productive basic science mentors focused on inflammation‐related topics.
Four training positions are requested. The overall research program will focus on mastery of molecular biology,
functional genomics and gene regulation, and in some cases applying artificial intelligence to this data, as it
applies broadly to inflammation research. Although the bulk of the training program will be in the laboratory of
an experienced research mentor, trainees will be expected to participate in didactic experiences that complement
their research experience. Select trainees will have the opportunity to complete a Ph.D. program in the Graduate
School in three to four years. Trainees can also participate in alternative advanced degrees (M.S., M.P.H.), or
can complete graduate certificate programs which are formal collections of courses that together form a coherent
program of study offered through an academic unit. This training program takes advantage of the unique
strengths of the College of Medicine in the expanding field of personalized medicine, as well as the existing
collaborations between basic scientists and clinicians committed to the training of future clinical academicians.
The interface between molecular biology and inflammation research will be targeted to trauma, sepsis,
ischemia/reperfusion injury, burn and vascular injury pathology and patients who enter chronic critical illness.
The faculty will be drawn from funded basic and clinical scientists with expertise or faculty appointments within
and without the Department of Surgery who will serve as research mentors to the trainees. Clinical mentors will
interact with the trainees and the research faculty to assure that the trainees are being exposed to clinically‐
important issues in inflammation research. Overall direction of the program will rest with the Program Director
and an Executive Committee. Candidates for the fellowship are recruited nationally and from the University of
Florida College of Medicine (Gainesville and Jacksonville). Successful applicants with the assistance of the
Executive Committee will identify a research and clinical mentor who will help formulate a formal individual

their own basic science departments, as well as laboratory research meetings. They will also be expected to

The level of each protein synthesized in a cell results from both the amount of mRNA available, and
the number of ribosomes that initiate translation of that mRNA. Eukaryotic translation initiation factors
(eIFs) can reprogram which mRNAs are available and translated to produce different levels of the
encoded proteins in response to discrete cellular signals. In fungal species, translational control plays
important roles in host evasion and other pathogenesis mechanisms, and in mammalian species,
altered levels and modifications of eIFs influence cancer progression and other disease states. A
number of protein factors stimulate translation, including the eIF4 factors (4A, B, E, G, and H) that
engage the 5’ cap of mRNA and the small subunit of the ribosome, to promote events prior to start
site recognition. Ample data support roles of the RNA helicase 4A and cofactors 4B and 4G in
unwinding 5’ UTRs to promote translation of structured mRNAs. However, the mRNAs that depend
on 4B activity for translation are distinct from those that rely heavily on 4G, even though both factors
promote 4A activity. Moreover, in striking contrast to protumorigenic 4A and 4G, increased levels of
4B improved survival of patients with aggressive cancers, and preliminary data directly implicated 4B
in opposing metastasis of murine breast cancers. Understanding how 4B mediates translation of
specific transcripts could be important for understanding and predicting metastatic phenotypes.
Finally, posttranslational modifications of the eIF4 factors are known to modulate translation in
mammals, and deregulation is common in disease states. However, it is unclear how modifications of
the eIF4 factors regulate translation in fungal species and how this affects expression of specific
mRNA pools. This proposal takes on these challenges, investing years of experience characterizing
the mechanics of yeast translation initiation and a powerful arsenal of in vitro, genetic, and genome-
wide tools. In order to better understand how mRNAs are selected by ribosomes for translation, the
objective of this work is to understand how 4B achieves translation versus repression of
specific mRNA pools in yeast. Three aims will be pursued: Aim 1. Determine how 4F and 4B
interactions affect translation of 4B hyper and hypo-dependent mRNAs. Aim 2. Elucidate yeast 4B-
RNA binding preferences. Aim 3. Understand how posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of 4F and
4B impact 4B-specific mRNA control. This proposal will use eIF4B as a model to determine how core
translation initiation factors modulate translation versus repression of specific mRNA pools and will
shed light on how robust activity of 4B opposes the metastatic phenotype."

 The opioid crisis has become a national epidemic and the statistics are startling. In the past decade there
has been a sharp increase in heroin use, opiate prescriptions and fentanyl abuse. Overdose deaths have doubled
nationally since 2000 and in 2015, and more than 33,000 deaths were attributable to overdose from opioids. In
addition, there has been a major increase between 1998 and 2011 in the number of opioid-dependent pregnant
women, such as with methadone dependency. Although opioids have been well studied in general, the epidemic
of opioid abuse, especially in pregnant women, has unmasked how little we know about the effect of methadone
on fetal brain development. In the past several years, we have taken advantage of a newer technology, the 3D-
brain organoids, that facilitated enormously the investigation of early human brain development. This has provided
us with an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the effect
of opioids on early brain development. Using such methods, we have been able to produce exciting preliminary
data showing that methadone decreases synaptic transmission and possibly affects synaptic plasticity. Based on
our recent results, we have posed the following overall hypothesis: Opioid exposure leads to
abnormal synaptogenesis and impaired synaptic transmission during fetal brain development. In order to
address this hypothesis, we have formulated the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect
of methadone on neural network activity during development in human cortical organoids. We will use multi-
electrode array recordings to explore how methadone modifies the neural network activity. Specific Aim 2: To
determine the effect of methadone on cellular electrophysiological properties and synaptic function and structure
during development in human cortical organoids. We will investigate AP firing properties, synaptic currents, and
Na+ and K+ currents in neurons and dissect the pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms using patch-clamp, molecular
and imaging techniques. Specific Aim 3: To dissect the mechanisms of the methadone-induced changes in
synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission in human cortical organoids. As thrombospondins 1,2 (TSP1,2),
astrocyte-secreted glycoproteins, play a role in neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine and synapse formation, we will
study the effect of methadone on TSPs to obtain an understanding of the molecular pathobiology of methadone’s
effect on the human fetal brain. Our studies in this application are novel and unique and address the important
problem of human brain maldevelopment under the influence of methadone in pregnant women. With an
understanding of the mechanisms involved in methadone effect, we believe that we can develop novel therapeutic
targets to mitigate the effect of methadone on brain development in early life."

Diastolic heart disease (DHD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. With no FDA approved
therapies to improve diastolic function, the NIH has placed special emphasis on collaborative initiatives bridging
basic science and clinical data to understanding the molecular mechanism of DHD. The hallmarks of diastolic
heart disease are a stiffening left ventricle and an inability for the heart muscle to relax, both of which occur in
DHD by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Building on recent work that the cardiac microtubule network
(MTN) can both stiffens and impairs the relaxation of failing cardiomyocytes, in Aim 1 we determine the relative
contribution of the MTN to myocardial stiffness in intact preparations of HTN and DHD ventricular myocardium.
We isolate the myocyte and fibrotic contribution to stiffening and use complimentary reductionist approaches to
isolate the relative contributions of actomyosin activity, passive titin stiffness, and the MTN to myocyte
mechanics. In Aim 2 we extend these findings into a clinically analogous ex-vivo working myocardial slice
preparation to dissect the MTN impediment to the phases of diastole in HTN and DHD. The working preparation
allows us to contextualize the findings in Aim 1 with the emergent properties arising from cyclically contracting
loaded myocardium. Thus, by carefully designing a series of complementary assays we will resolve the
molecular contributions to cardiac stiffening and impaired relaxation in DHD, and in doing so determine the
potential for MTN-targeting therapies in DHD."

High Drinking in the Dark (HDID) mice have been selectively bred to drink to intoxication. HDID mice are
genetically distinct and represent a unique genotype for drug screening. Many of the compounds that reduce
drinking in other strains (e.g., C57BL/6J) do not reduce drinking in HDID mice, and also fail to reduce drinking
in humans. Many INIA-Neuroimmune studies have found that alcohol alters inflammatory signaling. We
employed a rigorous approach for testing whether several compounds targeting immune signaling could
reduce binge-like drinking in HDID mice. To date, 14 out of 28 compounds tested in HDID mice were able to
reduce binge-like drinking in HDID mice. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor and our most
promising clinical target, and other compounds that reduced binge-like drinking have one thing in common -
they increase anti-inflammatory (e.g. IL-10) signaling. These results offer a broadly unifying hypothesis for
more mechanistic experiments to investigate how the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling regulates
binge-like drinking in HDID mice. Here, we study this mechanism in the context of initiation of binge-like
drinking, and determine whether this framework holds true under chronic binge drinking conditions. An
overarching goal of this proposal is to identify and target anti-inflammatory signatures to reduce drinking and
restore alcohol-induced changes in anti- and pro-inflammatory signaling in the brain. Specfic Aim 1 tests
whether specific inflammatory signaling pathways contribute to binge-like drinking in iHDID mice using a
combination of complementary molecular, genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches in
collaboration with INIA-N PIs Roberto, Mangieri, Bilbo, and Lasek. Specific Aim 2 tests whether chronic binge-
like drinking is accompanied and/or regulated by anti-inflammatory gene expression in iHDID-1 mice. Aim 2 will
employ informatics approaches to identify compounds for behavioral and molecular studies in collaboration
with INIA-N PI Mayfield. This project also collaborates with INIA-Stress PIs Vazey/Mooreman and
Becker/Lopez to test the effects of promising compounds on other behaviors, and shares the HDID and HS/Npt
mouse lines as unique resources developed and maintained under this award with investigators nationwide."

Cold temperature (<15°C) exposure stimulates perivascular beige adipocyte progenitor cells (bAPCs) to
generate beige adipocytes. Beige adipocytes act as cellular furnaces to burn blood glucose and free fatty acids
to generate heat. Recent studies have shown the metabolic benefits of beige adipocytes, suggesting potential
clinical efficacy for obese patients and type 2 diabetics. However, the potential to form cold-induced beige
adipocytes declines with age, creating a pivotal challenge to the therapeutic promise for older individuals, many
of whom constitute the obesity epidemic. Our studies begin to unravel how aging suppresses beige adipogenic
potential and identifies new ways to rejuvenate beige fat cell biogenesis to restore metabolic fitness in aged
mammals. Our previous studies have linked cellular senescence, a state of cellular arrest, of bAPCs to the age-
associated decline in beige adipose tissue. In an attempt to find additional mechanisms blocking beige fat
biogenesis in aged mammals, we found that the expression and signaling of platelet derived growth factor
receptor beta (Pdgfrβ) is increased in aged bAPCs. Moreover, ablation of Pdgfrβ within the beige adipose lineage
restored beige adipocyte generation and improved metabolic health in aged (not young) mice. Despite beige fat
formation in aged Pdgfrβ-deficient mice, lineage-tracing studies revealed that auxiliary source(s) generated
beige adipocytes. In agreement, senescence tests demonstrated that Pdgfrβ neither promoted nor reversed
cellular senescence. Instead, we found that Pdgfrβ signaling prevents group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)
recruitment and activation within iWAT depots. Mechanistically, we identified that Pdgfrβ elicits signals via Stat1
to suppress the ILC2-inducer, interleukin-33 (IL-33), to control WAT ILC2 activity. Finally, we identify sympathetic
tone as a significant regulator of age-induced Pdgfrβ expression. Our aims will elucidate the physiological and
cellular role of Pdgfrβ in regulating beige fat biogenesis under aging and obese conditions. We will elucidate the
Pdgfrβ-Stat1 signaling mechanism in bAPCs to control ILC2 recruitment via IL-33. We uncover how sympathetic
output regulates Pdgfrβ expression to drive the age-dependent beige adipogenic failure. These findings will
implicate Pdgfrβ signaling as a central node in the bAPC aging process. Importantly, this application will identify
factors that reverse age-dependent beige adipogenic failure with a direct clinical utility to combat excess body
fat and metabolic dysfunction to extend lifespan and restore health."

Systemic and structural racism is a public health crisis. However, little is known about the impact of
structural racism and discrimination (SRD) on the health and emotional well-being of individuals across the life
course. While prior studies have shown associations between discrimination and negative health outcomes in
adults (e.g., cardiometabolic disease, depression), these studies have been cross-sectional and primarily
examined individual-level sources of racism and discrimination. Much more research is needed to fill gaps
in our understanding about the relationship between SRD and health disparities before interventions
can be developed. To significantly advance the field regarding SRD and health equity, studies need to
include: (1) multi-level measures of SRD including individual (both intrapersonal and interpersonal),
neighborhood, institutional, and societal/policy levels; (2) rigorous mixed-methods designs (e.g., ecological
momentary assessment (EMA), biological measures, geographic information system (GIS) data, surveys); (3)
multi-site samples with urban and rural participants; (4) a life course approach; (5) whole-person outcome
measures (i.e., mental, physical, behavioral health); and (6) longitudinal study designs. Including these study
elements will allow for comprehensively examining the relationships between SRD and health and emotional
well-being to identify mechanisms to target in interventions to mitigate SRD. The main objective of the
proposed study is to examine multiple levels (i.e., individual, neighborhood, institutional,
societal/policy) of SRD and associations with mental, physical, and behavioral health outcomes across
the life course to identify intervention targets to promote health equity. The proposed study is built on a
prospective longitudinal cohort study of 627 racially/ethnically diverse families (i.e., African American, Hispanic,
Native American, Immigrant/Refugee, White) across the life course (childhood, adolescence,
adulthood/parenthood) from urban settings (i.e., Minneapolis, St. Paul). The parent R01 already has three
time-points of mixed-methods data (i.e., EMA, GIS, survey) that includes discrimination and neighborhood
segregation measures and physical and behavioral health outcomes carried out using a community-based
participatory approach. For the proposed study, a sample of 300 racially/ethnically diverse families from rural
Georgia (i.e., Athens) will be added to compare SRD experiences in urban versus rural settings. In addition,
cardiometabolic and stress biomarker data (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, HbA1C,
cytokines) and multi-level measures of structural racism (i.e., individual, neighborhood, institutional,

Each year over 107,000 patients initiate hemodialysis (HD) for the treatment of advanced kidney failure in the
United States alone. The risk of death is startling, with peak mortality observed during the first two months, most
of which relates to cardiovascular (CV) disease. The majority of incident HD patients are hypervolemic and have
evidence of cardiac structural abnormalities, which are associated with a higher risk of adverse CV outcomes.
Furthermore, patients who lose residual renal function rapidly appear to be at highest risk of adverse outcomes.
 Pharmacologic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is known to reduce CV outcomes in non-HD patients
and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, but these beneficial effects have not
been observed in the HD population. Combining an angiotensin receptor blocker with a neprilysin inhibitor has
been shown to reduce CV outcomes in patients with heart failure, while at the same time slowing the rate of
kidney function decline. Therefore, there is strong biologic rationale to test the effects of this therapy in incident
HD patients.
 Thus, building on our prior data, in we propose a pilot randomized placebo-controlled parallel group clinical
trial to test the safety and tolerability of sacubitril/valsartan and test the effects (vs. placebo) on the reduction of
left atrial volume index and preservation of residual renal function in incident HD patients. The results of our
studies will inform the design and development of a larger multi-center outcomes trial, which is urgently needed
to address the unacceptably high rates of mortality in incident HD.
 In summary, our proposals are clinically relevant, feasible, innovative, and are supported by preliminary data.
Building on the underlying pathophysiology and our experience in performance of clinical trials, our proposals
have the potential to improve care for patients undergoing initiation of HD for kidney failure."
10771282,"This is a competitive U01 renewal application under the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism-
Neuroimmune (INIA-N) Consortium (Notice# RFA-AA-20-11/12/13). It is designed to integrate multidisciplinary
research projects based on the genomic, cellular, and behavioral neuroadaptations related to excessive alcohol
consumption. The overall premise is that excessive alcohol consumption produces changes and adaptations in
immune-related pathways that promote and sustain drinking. Mounting evidence indicates that immune-related
pathways, including cytokines, are critical to regulating neuronal functions in addiction-related brain regions that
underly the excessive drinking and behavioral phenotype associated with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Notably,
transcriptomic, and functional results point to interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling as a strong candidate to test our
central hypothesis that cytokines are integral to the neuroadaptations occurring in GABAergic and glutamatergic
synapses and play a critical role in excessive drinking and anxiety-like behaviors associated with ethanol
dependence and withdrawal. Specifically, we hypothesize that chronic ethanol-induced activation of IL-6
signaling is a major mediator of the central amygdala (CeA) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) synaptic
changes that contribute to the escalation of drinking and the associated negative affect. We anticipate that
chronic ethanol will produce sex-, brain region- and cell type-specific IL-6 functional changes that subsequently
contribute to ethanol dependence-associated behavioral phenotypes and persist (or be exacerbated) with
ethanol withdrawal. We will study the IL-6 pathway and its positive and negative regulators (including SOCS3
and IL-10) to unveil potential therapeutic targets to alleviate ethanol-induced inflammation and ameliorate
alcohol-related behaviors. In Aim 1 and 2, to induce ethanol dependence, we will use the chronic intermittent
ethanol–two-bottle choice (CIE-2BC) paradigm in both male and female mice. We will apply behavioral,
biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches to characterize dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathways
in alcohol-drinking animals. Aim 3 will investigate the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of ethanol-
induced neuroimmune responses on physiological functions across species (rodents and rhesus macaques) and
cellular and molecular mechanisms of the candidate drugs/neuroimmune signaling that are identified by other
INIA-N projects. Thus, we anticipate that our studies will identify cellular mechanisms and neuroimmune targets
that contribute to excessive alcohol drinking. Furthermore, our INIA collaborations will promote replicability and
translational aspects by testing our key targets in multiple species using multiple complementary approaches to
bridge alcohol basic research with the human condition.
The key personnel have extensive publications within their areas of expertise and ongoing interactions with many
INIA PIs that are invaluable for the completion of the proposed studies. Drs. Roberto and Bajo will be dedicated
to the electrophysiology and biochemical studies, and Dr. Roberts to the behavioral studies."

 Despite effective strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC)
remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. While there have been considerable
policy and system-level efforts to increase CRC screening rates, uptake remains well below national goals of
80% participation, and racial/ethnic disparities remain. Colonoscopy and FIT are considered evidence-based
and top-tier tests for CRC screening, but most screening programs rely heavily on one of these tests.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate a multi-level intervention that could durably increase
CRC screening rates by incorporating principles of behavioral economics, such as opt-out framing, simplifying
choice, and effort reduction. Through partnership with the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS),
we will develop a centralized program that includes clinician-directed nudges facilitated by the electronic health
record (EHR) and direct outreach to patients. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of sequential choice
(colonoscopy, then FIT to those who defer or decline) compared to offering colonoscopy only.
 This is a 3-year pragmatic clinical trial with 2 x 3 factorial design at 30 diverse primary care practices
with 20,000 average-risk patients who are overdue for screening. Clinicians will be cluster randomized in a 1:1
ratio (at the practice level) to A) colonoscopy only, or B) sequential choice (colonoscopy, then FIT if no
colonoscopy is completed) nudges in the EHR during clinic visits (Aim 1). Concurrently, patients will be
individually randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to 1) no outreach, 2) colonoscopy only, or 3) sequential choice outreach
of colonoscopy, then FIT (Aim 2). The primary outcome is completion of guideline-recommended colorectal
cancer screening. Through surveys and qualitative interviews, we will explore patient and clinician factors
impacting the effectiveness of the intervention."

Gender-diverse (GD) individuals are underserved, targets of violence, and at higher risk for negative health
outcomes. Although up to 66% of GD individuals are assigned female at birth (AFAB) and up to 97% of these
individuals have gender-related voice problems, there is no evidence-based treatment for voice
masculinization, a critical factor in gender-affirming medical intervention and personal safety. Most clinicians
and many patients are left to assume that gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone (T) is the only
path toward voice change. The current speculation is that T leads to an increase in the size of the vocal folds,
leading to lower fundamental frequency (fo), and thus to voice masculinization. However, this theory has not
been directly assessed, and T is likely to cause additional structural changes to the larynx and vocal tract that
may impact both self- and listener vocal-perception of gender (VPoG). In summary, despite a critical health
need in an at-risk population, there is a lack of evidence supporting this common voice treatment for GD-AFAB
individuals. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate our conceptual model of voice and speech in GD-AFAB
speakers: 1) that T results in anatomical changes in vocal fold length, vocal fold thickness, and vocal tract
length, decreasing voice fo and speech formants, which leads to changes in VPoG; and 2) that individual
characteristics are related to the degree of VPoG changes with T. This observational study will follow GD-
AFAB adults who are being treated with T as part of their normal clinical care to systemically test this model.
In Aim 1, we will longitudinally characterize the effects of T in GD-AFAB individuals, providing unprecedented
understanding of the actual impact of this common treatment at the group level. In addition to anatomical,
physiological, and acoustical measures, perceptions of both self and others will be included to account for
potential misalignment of these perceptions, which are equally important outcome measures of voice
modification [8, 99]. This aim will provide evidence-based expectations about voice masculinization for
individuals considering the use of T. Aims 2 and 3 will examine changes in VPoG at the individual level,
regardless of group-level findings in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will define the anatomical, physiological, and
acoustical changes associated with changes in VPoG with T. This aim will identify how T modifies
communication, which will allow for objective outcomes and therapeutic targets in future clinical trials. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will determine participant characteristics that are associated with changes in VPoG with T,
providing more precise expectations about individual treatment responses.
Together, these aims will provide a roadmap for future evidence-based treatment: clinicians will be able to
provide guidance about when, how, and in whom communication will be impacted by T."

This K23 proposal will provide Calyani Ganesan, MD, MS with dedicated time, mentorship, training, and
research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Ganesan is a clinician-scientist with a
long-term vision of improving the quality of care for patients with urinary stones. Under the guidance of a strong
mentorship team, she will acquire skills in: 1) advanced statistical methods used in pharmacoepidemiology
studies; 2) the collection and analysis of prospective patient data; and 3) a novel bone imaging technique,
high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), to assess skeletal status.
This grant proposes to improve the screening and management of patients with urinary stone disease and
diminished bone strength. Despite an increased risk of fracture in patients with urinary stone disease, there are
currently no guidelines regarding the screening and treatment of osteoporosis in these patients. It is also
unclear which medications might provide dual benefit in decreasing skeletal fragility and reducing stone
recurrence in these patients. This project aims to: 1) identify patients with urinary stone disease who are at
high risk for osteoporosis or fracture; 2) determine the effects of medications used to treat osteoporosis on
urinary stone disease; and 3) identify the underlying bone deficits in patients with urinary stone disease using
HR-pQCT and bone biomarkers reflecting bone formation and resorption. The first two aims will be answered
by analyzing national data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Optum datasets. For the third
aim, Dr. Ganesan will recruit patients with urinary stone disease from the Stanford University and Veterans
Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System Kidney Stone clinics. She will use HR-pQCT and serum biomarkers to
measure and monitor bone parameters over time in these patients.
The proposed work has potential to make a significant clinical impact. Successful completion will enable
clinicians to identify which patients with urinary stone disease should be screened osteoporosis and inform
clinicians how best to treat these patients so that fracture associated comorbidity and recurrent stones can be
reduced. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and the research infrastructure at
Stanford is already in place. Dr. Ganesan is poised to build on her research skills, advance and disseminate
scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and eventually compete for R01 or equivalent
funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Ganesan to become a successful
independent clinical investigator."

Increasing evidence indicates that both zona incerta (ZI) and paraventricular thalamus (PVT) play important
roles in the regulation of feeding. Our previous study reported that activation of ZI GABA neurons and their
projections to PVT rapidly evokes binge-like eating. Food deprivation activates ZI GABA neurons and selective
ablation of ZI GABA neurons suppresses daily food intake and body weight gain in mice, supporting the
importance of ZI GABA neurons in the physiological feeding control. However, it remains largely unknown how
the ZI-PVT pathway is innervated and controlled by other brain areas for the feeding regulation. In this
application, we propose to study how central serotonin (5-HT) signaling targeting both ZI and PVT for the
feeding control. Although the importance of central 5-HT signaling in the satiety regulation is well-known, little
is known what raphe 5-HT projections regulate feeding motivation. Our pilot data show that both ZI and PVT
receive dense 5-HT projections from raphe nuclei, including both dorsal and medial raphe. Food deprivation
depressed the activity of dorsal raphe neurons that project to ZI and PVT. In addition, 5-HT excited PVT
neurons but inhibited ZI neurons as well as ZI-PVT GABA transmission. Based on the significant role of the ZI-
PVT neural pathway in feeding control, we hypothesize that: 1) raphe neurons send 5-HT signaling to modulate
both ZI and PVT neurons, and inhibit ZI-PVT GABA transmission. 2) raphe 5-HT projections to ZI and PVT
regulate feeding motivation and food intake. 3) chronic high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet alters 5-HT inhibition
on PVT-projecting ZI neurons and ZI-PVT GABA transmission. Aim 1 of the proposal is focused on the study
about the functional 5-HT neural projections from raphe to both ZI and PVT, and the modulatory effects of 5-
HT signaling on ZI and PVT neurons. Using slice electrophysiology in combination with optogenetics to target
specific neurons in brain slices, we will corroborate the differential modulation of 5-HT signaling on ZI and PVT
neurons as well as ZI-PVT GABA transmission. In Aim 2, we will examine how raphe 5-HT projections to both
ZI and PVT regulate feeding motivation and food intake. In the proposed experiments for the behavioral study,
we will use optogenetic tools to manipulate raphe 5-HT neurons and their projections to ZI and PVT. We will
also use slice electrophysiology and c-fos immunoreactivity to study how ZI- and PVT-projecting 5-HT neurons
respond to the metabolic states, revealing the role of raphe 5-HT projections to ZI and PVT in the physiological
feeding regulation. In Aim 3, we will study how chronic HFHS diets alter 5-HT inhibition on PVT-projecting ZI
neurons and ZI-PVT GABA transmission. Together, the proposal in this application will elucidate a novel role
of 5-HT signaling in the regulation of food intake by targeting both ZI and PVT. Also, the findings from this
project will help further understand how dysfunctional brain 5-HT signaling is involved in overeating and obesity."

Preexisting cognitive deficits or exposure to stressors both increase the probability of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
These relationships are bidirectional, and excessive alcohol consumption can also directly impact cognition and
dysregulate stress systems. Individual differences in cognition and stress reactivity are thought to define
phenotypes within the AUD spectrum which may differ in disease prognosis and responsivity across treatment
strategies. As such, precisely defining the behavioral and neurobiological substrates mediating covariance
across cognitive, stress, and drinking domains is critical for our understanding of AUD. However, until recently
we have lacked technical approaches which would allow for determination of whether individual differences in
these behaviors arise from the same neurons or from distinct populations within brain regions. To parse how
these phenotypes manifest we must 1) quantify the complex individual differences that emerge at the intersection
of stress, alcohol drinking, and cognitive function and 2) determine the precise neurons in the brain that control
these interactions. To this end, we will first use deep phenotyping of both behavioral and neuronal features to
computationally define individual differences across domains in mice. Previous studies have demonstrated that
prefrontal cortex is a critical mediator of cognitive function, responses to stressors, and drinking, but the precise
degree of shared circuitry between these behaviors is unclear. Thus, we will use a longitudinal design to define
the neuronal plasticity signatures in prefrontal cortex that govern expression and interactions between these
behaviors within the same subjects. Mouse models offer unique advantages for defining the precise cell-types
within the prefrontal cortex that give rise to these behaviors, but it will also be essential to determine if these
neurobehavioral relationships are conserved in higher-order species. Using a cross-species approach,
conservation of relationships between plasticity in specific cortical cell-types and individual differences in
cognitive, stress, and alcohol interactions observed in mice will then be directly tested in ex vivo brain slices from
non-human primates. Successful completion of this proposal will provide novel insight into the circuit basis of

Over half of all new HIV infections in the US in 2017 occurred in 48 high-incidence counties and rural states
known as HIV “hotspots”, indicating a need to intensify HIV prevention efforts in these regions. Preexposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce new HIV infections by 99%, but PrEP use is limited in hotspots in the South
where HIV incidence is highest. The criminal justice system is a prime location to engage persons in PrEP, as
many people who pass through jails and prisons have risk factors for acquiring HIV. Implementing PrEP in jails
in particular, where medically underserved Black and Latinx populations are over-represented, can have a high
public health impact given rapid turnover back to the community. Because virtually no jails in the South offer
PrEP due to resource constraints and competing priorities, there is a critical need for strategies to implement
PrEP in this setting. Our central hypothesis is that a rigorously-developed PrEP implementation strategy can
improve linkage to community PrEP care for persons released from southern jails. The objective of this
proposal is to develop, implement and evaluate a multicomponent PrEP implementation strategy for the Dallas
County Jail, the 8th largest jail in the nation and located in an HIV hotspot. We will leverage our robust
partnerships with stakeholders in the jail, public health department, and community as we follow a well-
established EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) framework. The implementation
strategy will include locally-adapted, evidence-based tools for identifying candidates for PrEP, engaging them
in shared decision-making about PrEP, and navigating them to PrEP care at community reentry. We will
rigorously evaluate our implementation strategy using a type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study,
which prioritizes implementation outcomes while also collecting clinical outcomes. Our specific aims are to: 1)
Assess facilitators and barriers to PrEP evaluations in jail and linkage to PrEP at jail release; 2) Refine a
multicomponent PrEP implementation strategy for the Dallas County Jail; and 3) Implement and evaluate the
PrEP implementation strategy. We will use mixed-methods to evaluate implementation processes (feasibility,
acceptability, penetration and sustainment) and clinical outcomes for PrEP evaluations and linkage, and an
interrupted time series to measure changes in HIV/STI testing and diagnoses. Our study team includes experts
in HIV, PrEP, implementation science, qualitative research, and clinical care for incarcerated populations. This
project is significant in its potential to impact HIV incidence in a highly affected population in an HIV hotspot.
The work is innovative in using implementation science to improve PrEP for incarcerated populations and is
directly responsive to NOT-MH-20-024, “Implementation Science to Advance the United States HIV Prevention
and Treatment Goals.” Our strategy is scalable and with guidance from Dissemination Consultants, can serve
as a model for future public health initiatives in other criminal justice settings, directing PrEP in a patient-
centered manner to those most likely to benefit in order to maximize impact on HIV incidence."
10773624,"Project Summary: Evolution of multiple resistance mechanisms from extensive use of antibiotics has eroded
the efficacy of one of the most important classes of antibiotics, the β-lactams. The situation is particularly dire
in non-fermenting gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where not only β-lactamase
enzymes (i.e., PDC, PER, and VIM) drive resistance but the outer membrane in concert with efflux serves as a
formidable barrier to antibiotic entry. This 3-year SBIR Direct-to-Phase II Application centers on completing the
lead optimization of a unique catechol-conjugated β-lactamase inhibitor (CC-BLI) series able to take advantage
of facilitated entry and offering an unprecedented level of activity against Multidrug-Resistant (MDR)
Pseudomonas when combined with ceftolozane (currently marketed as Zerbaxa®). The commercial
presentation of Zerbaxa® is intravenous ceftolozane combined with the legacy β-lactamase inhibitor
tazobactam; however, tazobactam fails to protect ceftolozane from Ambler class C Pseudomonas-derived
cephalosporinases (PDC), as well as class A (KPC), B (VIM and NDM), and D (OXA) carbapenemase. In
addition to enhanced entry the CC-BLI series has activity against serine and metallo-β-lactamase enzymes
including those that hydrolyze carbapenems. At the completion of lead optimization, the resulting Preclinical
Development Candidate will be paired with ceftolozane (TOL), which best supports the potent activity in P.
aeruginosa. This candidate TOL/CC-BLI combination will be advanced through Non-GLP toxicology activities
and eventually to IND filing and approval.
Ultimately, it is envisioned that this new combination product will provide a unique clinical option for empiric
therapy of MDR non-fermenter infections in the hospital general ward and ICU and as a second-line therapy for
susceptible organisms."
10779580,"Abstract
 RB1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in various tumors, including
retinoblastomas, small cell lung cancers, triple-negative breast cancers, prostate cancers, and osteosarcomas.
In addition, RB1 is one of the most prevalent tumor suppressor genes driving metastasis. Despite extensive
studies of pRb family proteins, a therapeutic approach that specifically targets defects in this tumor suppressor
is currently not available, representing a critical knowledge gap and the need to search for alternative
strategies for treating cancers with inactivated RB1.
 Synthetic lethality (SL) presents a viable approach to target RB1-mutated tumors. A pair of genes can
be defined as having a SL interaction when perturbation of either gene alone is not lethal but simultaneous
perturbation of both genes is lethal. We previously performed a genetic screen for SL partners of Rb in the
Drosophila eye and then confirmed the validity of identified targets (splicing machinery, RAN, eIF4A3, and
others) in human cancer cell lines and patient tumor samples. Moreover, we demonstrated that these SL
interactions are preserved in the presence of additional strong oncogenic alterations such as activation of Ras
and loss of Pten (Parkhitko et al., 2021). We hypothesize that combined targeting of two synthetic lethal
partners belonging to different pathways would have an additive/synergistic effect on the proliferation of RB1-
deficient cells and the growth of xenograft tumors.
 In this application, we propose to test a small library of drugs targeting the identified SL
targets/pathways alone and pairwise in isogenic pairs of RB1-relevant cancer cell lines (Aim 1); and to test
whether the combined targeting of two SL partners selectively and more efficiently to single drugs slows down
the growth of xenograft tumors (Aim 2). We expect that our proposal will have a high translational impact as we
will prioritize the FDA-approved drugs that can be easily translated to a human clinical trial and provide a
personalized approach to RB1-mutated cancers. In addition, we will get new insights into the biology of RB1-
deficient cells that belong to the top most often mutant tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells."

Unfortunately, no regenerative options exists and current treatments do not restore full function.
The articulating tissue of the condyle is a fibrocartilage that consists of an intricate interface

to a homogenous sponge scaffold and untreated control defects. First, we will study the
properties of a multilayer scaffold design in-vitro. We will characterize the permeability and

defects treated with the multilayer scaffolds. We will assess mechanical properties, regenerate
tissue composition, and condylar architecture formation using terminal assays at 1, 3 and 6
months post-surgery. Third, we will study the regeneration potential of three cell subpopulations
found on the condyle. Successful completion of this proposal is the critical step to provide a
regenerative therapy to treat TMJ mandibular cartilage degeneration, and a basis for successful

care system that could shape patient-care for the millions of older adults with hearing loss."
10757755,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia among adults with overall 
poor prognosis. More specific therapies have been developed against FLT3(ITD/TKD)-positive AML 
(FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKi). Still, complete remissions are rare, and after initial 
response the leukemia invariably progresses within a few months.
AML cells accumulate lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but DSB repair pathways 
maintain their survival. BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination (HR) usually plays a major role 
in DSB repair. However, we reported that leukemias expressing AML1-ETO and PML-RAR, 15- 35% of 
karyotypic normal AMLs, and TKi – treated FLT3(ITD/TKD)-positive AMLs (39% of karyotypic 
normal AMLs) are HR-deficient. Proliferation of HR-deficient solid tumor cells depends on DNA 
polymerase theta (Polθ) encoded by POLQ gene, which promotes a backup DSB repair called 
microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). According to cBioPortal database AMLs express the 
highest levels of POLQ mRNA among all tumors. Western blot analysis detected high levels of Polθ in 
AML cells when compared to normal counterparts. Altogether, these findings 
supported by preliminary data suggest that survival of AML cells (especially 
HR-deficient), which are under constant genotoxic stress, depends on Polθ. Therefore, 
Polθ may be a novel and promising drug target in AML.
Our preliminary data suggest that AML-inducing mutations [FLT3(ITD/TKD) +/- TET2mut, 
DNMT3Amut, MLL-AF9, AML1-ETO] can modulate the sensitivity of AML cells to the inhibition of Polθ. 
Therefore, in Aim #1 we will inhibit Polθ (shRNA, mutants and Polq-/- cells) and introduce 
AML-inducing mutations (retroviral infection, CRISPR/Cas9) to pinpoint mutations, 
which predispose leukemia cells to be sensitive to Polθ inhibition +/- standard cytotoxic drugs.
Using high throughput screening followed by biochemical testing and in vitro cellular sensitivity 
assays, we identified Polθ inhibitors (Polθi) that specifically kill HR-deficient primary AML 
cells. In Aim #2 we will further develop Polθi towards novel drug-like entities as targeted 
therapeutics for AMLs.
In Aim #3 we will employ murine AML-like models, primary AML cells and xenografts to test 
therapeutic potential of inhibition of Polθ combined with (1) other DNA repair inhibitors (RAD52i, 
PARPi) against HR-deficient AMLs, and (2) standard cytotoxic drugs against HR-proficient AMLs.
We anticipate that Polθi developed in these studies will be effective against a wide-range of AMLs 
and ultimately will be advanced to clinical trials."
10757703,"Over the past year, the entire world has been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of February 2021, there
have been over 112 million confirmed cases and over 2.5 million deaths globally. In New York City, the initial
US epicenter of the pandemic, there have been >700,000 cases, >89,000 hospitalizations, and >29,000
deaths. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have experienced alarming rates of anxiety, stress, and insomnia due to
COVID-19, which are likely to persist beyond the pandemic. In the proposed work, we will examine the
presence and predictors of long-term psychological symptoms and the consequences for cardiovascular health
among emergency department (ED) HCWs following the COVID-19 pandemic. This work is necessary to
understand the scope of the problem and to inform efforts to protect the health of these frontline HCWs who
have risked their lives to ensure our safety. Pre-COVID, ED HCWs were already known to be at greater
psychological risk than nearly every other subgroup of clinicians. Psycho-physiologic stress factors have been
dramatically magnified during the COVID period, in what has been referred to as a “parallel pandemic” of
surging mental and physical harm faced by HCWs. It is critical to understand the presence of sustained
psychological symptoms seen in HCWs who treated COVID patients, as well as downstream impacts on
cardiovascular health. Our preliminary work showed that HCWs experienced significant acute psychological
distress during the initial COVID peak in New York City. In a survey of hospital HCWs conducted in April
2020, we found high rates of acute stress disorder (65%), anxiety (36%), and insomnia (70%). Early evidence
points to persistence of psychological symptoms. In these participants, 25% experienced post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and 39% experienced insomnia at a 10 week follow-up. In the proposed study, we will (1)
examine the prevalence and predictors of sustained psychological symptoms in ED HCWs who provided care
during the COVID pandemic; (2) characterize the relationship of psychological symptoms to 3-year progression
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; and (3) examine a potential protective factor (i.e.,
resilient coping) in the development of COVID-related psychological symptoms. To achieve these aims, we will
conduct a prospective 3-year study of psychological and cardiovascular health in ED HCWs exposed to some of
the highest COVID case rates in the world. At study baseline (Year 0) and at each annual follow-up (Years 1-3),
we will conduct a thorough psychological test battery that includes measures of COVID-related PTSD, COVID-
related fear, insomnia, and resilient coping. Each participant’s ASCVD risk score will be computed annually.
Our primary exposure and predictor of psychological symptoms will be the computed “Covid burden,”
quantified as the number of shifts worked between March 1, 2020 (date of our hospital’s index case) and study
enrollment, in which COVID admissions exceeded 15% of total ED patients. Findings will inform interventions
to protect mental and physical wellbeing in HCWs as we navigate this and future public health crises."
10757706,"Project Summary/Abstract
We aim to improve the cure rates for metastatic cancers. To achieve this we propose a combined modality
approach to stimulate and diversify an endogenous anti-tumor immune response at all tumor sites to recognize
and destroy tumor cells in a manner that will prevent recurrence and enable long-term cancer free survival.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI; e.g. anti-PD-L1), are a class of immunotherapies that modulate immune
tolerance of a tumor by blocking specific inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions on the surface of T cells and
thereby overcoming T cell inhibition or exhaustion. In patients with immunologically “hot” tumors, characterized
by a pre-existing but exhausted anti-tumor immune response, ICIs can restore efficacy to the anti-tumor immune
response, sometimes resulting in complete and durable tumor regression. However, ICIs have not shown clinical
benefit in the treatment of immunologically “cold” cancers that are characterized by low levels of T cell infiltrate
and low mutation burden resulting in few mutation-created neo-antigens. To overcome immunotherapy treatment
barriers posed by immunologically cold tumors, we propose to combine systemic delivery of ICIs with systemic
delivery of radiation by targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). To date, nearly all approaches to combining
radiation and immunotherapy have used external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), which promotes tumor immune
cell infiltration through activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses. Administration of EBRT to multiple tumor
sites or to the whole body (to target radiographically occult or microscopic disease) would result in prohibitive
toxicity, including lymphopenia. TRT is a systemic method of delivering a therapeutic radionuclide to a tumor,
which poses an alternative option for delivery of immunomodulatory radiation to metastatic tumor sites without
causing immunosuppression. The Weichert lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has developed a novel
class of TRT, known as NM600, an alkylphosphocholine analog that is selectively taken up and retained in nearly
any tumor type in any location. Our broad hypothesis is that unique physical properties of radionuclides (e.g.
emission type, linear energy transfer, half-life, tissue range) differentially impact immunomodulation by TRT. In
this study, the immunomodulatory capacity of alpha- (225Ac) and beta- (90Y) particle emitting radionuclides will be
compared directly. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of the Morris and Weichert
labs, we will now determine the radionuclide-specific potency of combining TRT with immunotherapy to enhance
the immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on preliminary
data showing potent synergy with the combination of TRT and ICI, 2) evaluate therapeutic mechanisms of TRT
and ICI using the intrinsic properties of 225Ac- and 90Y-NM600, focusing on type I IFN response activation and 3)
investigate potential enhanced tumor responses with the combination of two distinct radionuclides with ICI. The
insights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical testing in
patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer."
10784024,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy exposure is a serious occupational hazard affecting oncology nurses. It could lead to infertility,
fetal anomalies, and cancer. Chemotherapy exposure occurs by the direct contact with chemotherapy drugs
through dermal absorption, inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Oncology nurses’ adherence to chemotherapy
handling guidelines is essential to prevent their exposure to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, oncology nurses’
adherence to these guidelines is suboptimal. The goal of the research in this application is to develop, validate,
and pilot test a novel “Workplace program to Improve Safe Handling of hazardous drugs” (WISH) intervention
to promote adherence to chemotherapy handling guidelines among oncology nurses. The WISH intervention
includes two components: 1) an educational component and 2) debriefing sessions on chemotherapy exposure
incidents. The first specific aim in this research is to develop and validate the WISH intervention using a mixed-
method approach. In this aim, Dr. Abu-Alhaija and her research team will: 1) develop an online educational
component on chemotherapy safety, 2) establish the content validity of the educational content based on
experts’ evaluation, and 3) establish the face validity of the educational component and determine other
intervention features (frequency, duration) by conducting 3 focus groups with oncology nurses (n=4-6 nurses
per group). The second aim is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the WISH intervention using a pilot
randomized controlled trial with two groups of oncology nurses; an intervention group (n= 30) and a control
group (n=30). This research will use The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
r2p approach by involving nurses in developing the intervention and planning the study activities in a way that
fits nurses’ work schedules and preferences. The immediate output from this research is an intervention that
can be implemented by healthcare institutions to increase nurses’ adherence to chemotherapy handling
guidelines. The short-term outcome is promoting the adherence to chemotherapy handling guidelines among
oncology nurses. The long-term outcome is improving the health and wellbeing for nurses and healthcare
workers. This research meets the current NIOSH priority strategic goal for research focuses on reducing
occupational cancer, cardiovascular disease, adverse reproductive outcomes, and other chronic
diseases, and the intermediate goal 1.3E: adherence to safe handling of hazardous drug guidance aimed
at preventing reproductive problems resulting from the inadequate adherence to safe handling guidelines.
Additionally, this study is very relevant to National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) for Healthcare and
Social Assistance sector, in which preventing occupational exposure to hazardous substances was identified
as a research priority. Plus, this research is pertinent to the Cancer, Reproductive, Cardiovascular, and
Other Chronic Disease Prevention Program cross-sector, as it aims to protect nurses from chemotherapy
exposure complications such as cancer, reproductive problems, and other chronic conditions."
10796206,"ABSTRACT
In addition to its pivotal roles in regulating cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and metabolism, the p53
tumor suppressor has been demonstrated to modulate innate immune and adaptive immune responses through
its crosstalk with key regulators of immune signaling pathways. The dysregulation of Interleukin 17 (IL17)
cytokine family and its receptors has been associated with many human diseases, notably inflammation and
cancer, crediting to their crucial roles in normal host immune responses. Particularly, Interleukin 17 Receptor B
(IL17RB) has been found to be overexpressed in various cancers through the activation of NFB, AKT, or ERK
signaling to promote tumorigenesis. Our preliminary results indicate that IL17RB is a p53 repression target and
repression of IL17RB sustains the p53 response. Additionally, activation of p53 by nutlin-3a or IL17RB depletion
decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL8 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The goal of
this application is to study the role of p53-mediated IL17RB repression in tumor suppression and inflammation
inhibition. We established systems of IL17RB repression, overexpression, and activation, that will enable
biochemical and cellular characterization as well as in-depth gene expression analyses to elucidate the
contribution of IL17RB repression to tumor suppressive and inflammation inhibitory function of p53. The
proposed work will not only allow us to gain a better understanding on how IL17RB links p53’s crosstalk with
other signaling pathways and how p53 attenuates oncogenic effects of chronic inflammation through repressing
IL17RB, but also provide a mechanistic basis for the development of novel anti-cancer strategies as well as
inflammation inhibitors. In addition, this project will enhance the research environment at St. John’s University
by providing undergraduate and graduate students with numerous opportunities to learn the fundamentals of
biomedical research."

The human body is composed of at least 400 different cell types, each distinguishable by distinct cellular markers.
Cancer cells also express distinct cellular markers, differentiating them from their precursor cell-type prior to
malignant transformation. Accordingly, the broad goal of oncology is targeted, tumor-specific therapies designed
to maximize therapeutic efficacy while avoiding undesired off-target effects. This is recognized as a major
obstacle for the application of current gene editing technologies. Proposed here is a strategy for tumor-specific
gene editing involving combined use of the chimeric adeno-associated virus / phage (AAVP) vector together with
the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) gene
editing system – collectively referred to as AAVP-CRISPR. The tissue-specific targeting aspect is carried out by
the phage capsid of AAVP, which can be modified to display a targeting peptide for ligand-directed delivery of a
desired transgene. AAVP, first introduced in 2006, is a well-characterized gene delivery tool that has been
explored in numerous tumor models. Here we plan to introduce two separate CRISPR/Cas systems with
previously demonstrated gene editing efficacy into the AAVP vector. The first construct will contain the
conventional CRISPR/Cas9 system, while the second construct will contain the more recently discovered
hypercompact CRISPR/CasΦ system, referred to as AAVP-CRISPR/Cas9 and AAVP-CRISPR/CasΦ,
respectively. The two constructs will be engineered to display RGD4C, a well-known, clinically viable tumor-
targeting peptide, and carry various gene editing guide RNA (gRNA) combinations. Gene editing using the two
constructs will first be performed in an in vitro setting, to confirm activity of the elements of each CRISPR/Cas
system, including receptor binding, cell internalization, Cas gene expression, and gene editing activity. Several
gRNA configurations will be tested in vitro and AAVP-CRISPR constructs containing the leading gRNA
candidates will be evaluated for tumor targeting, Cas expression, and gene editing activity in vivo. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide insight into the efficacy of AAVP-CRISPR for tumor-specific gene
editing and contribute to the development of much needed novel therapeutic strategies for cancer."

10759363,"Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in Veterans. CVD-related
deaths are over twice as likely in patients with comorbid alcohol misuse, due in part to alcohol misuse
directly exacerbating several modifiable factors that lead to CVD. No interventions exist targeting both
these comorbidities, and current VA/DoD treatment guidelines for comorbid alcohol misuse in primary care
are ineffective. Because alcohol misuse is often a recurrent problem, and the dominant driver of treatment
recommendations, timely treatment of these Veterans’ CVD risk in conjunction with alcohol misuse
treatment in may be critical for developing clinical traction with CVD risk. Dr. Blalock seeks to refine a
telehealth intervention and acquire necessary training throughout this CDA-2 proposal to begin his career
as an independent VA health services researcher who seeks to improve the effectiveness and reach of
behavioral health treatments for Veterans with comorbid behavioral health problems.
Significance/Impact: 9-32% of the entire Veteran population has comorbid alcohol misuse and modifiable
elevated CVD risk. This high-risk population is entirely preventable, but is undertreated and understudied.
The proposed CDA research would be the first to directly target this high-risk population. This research is
highly relevant to Veteran health, VHA priorities, and HSR&D priorities because the combined intervention
targets and telehealth approaches address critical gaps in treatment timeliness and access.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 –Characterize a national cohort of Veterans with alcohol misuse and modifiable CVD
risk, their alcohol services utilization, and clinical outcomes. Aim 2 – Qualitatively assess barriers to
treatment for Veterans with alcohol misuse and CVD risk across multiple stakeholders. Aim 3 – Use a
successive cohort design to iteratively develop an intervention based on patient feedback. Aim 4 – Test the
acceptability and feasibility of an intervention to reduce alcohol misuse and CVD risk in Veterans.
Innovation: This application is highly innovative in its attempt to address for the first time: 1) perceptions of
barriers to treatment in this population, 2) the utility of a combined intervention for alcohol misuse and CVD
risk, 3) multimorbid patient preferences for timing of treatments for multiple different targets, and 4) the
sustainability of health behavior habits in VA formed by an intervention using “implementation intentions.”
Methodology: Aim 1 will use electronic health records to examine the status of key health criteria and
services utilization among Veterans with alcohol misuse, both with and without comorbid CVD risk. Aim 2
will use qualitative interviews of both Veterans with comorbid alcohol misuse and elevated modifiable CVD
risk, their providers across different settings, and systems-level stakeholders to assess current treatment
barriers. Aim 3 will employ a successive cohort design to iteratively test the proposed intervention with
rapid and early feedback from multiple Veteran cohorts. Aim 4 will test a refined intervention based on
feedback from Aims 2 and 3 to determine the acceptability to Veteran patients, as well as the feasibility of
recruitment, randomization, and intervention.
Next Steps/Implementation: Beginning in Aim 1, a systems-level advisory board will be convened semi-
annually with the goal of eliciting feedback throughout intervention development to aid implementation. By
the end of the 3rd year of the CDA-2, an IIR application will be submitted to fund a randomized comparative
effectiveness trial of the Aim 3 intervention. Results will also be presented to local Veterans engagement
panels associated with “VetREP.” Additional feedback from OCC and OMHSP operations partners, and
implementation considerations gleaned from utilization patterns and care settings in Aim 4, will allow rapid
development of a post-IIR implementation plan. Additional training in cost effectiveness and implementation
science will also give Dr. Blalock the skills to follow through with additional research and implementation."

behavioral health treatments for Veterans with comorbid behavioral health problems.
Significance/Impact: 9-32% of the entire Veteran population has comorbid alcohol misuse and modifiable
elevated CVD risk. This high-risk population is entirely preventable, but is undertreated and understudied.
The proposed CDA research would be the first to directly target this high-risk population. This research is
highly relevant to Veteran health, VHA priorities, and HSR&D priorities because the combined intervention
targets and telehealth approaches address critical gaps in treatment timeliness and access.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 –Characterize a national cohort of Veterans with alcohol misuse and modifiable CVD
risk, their alcohol services utilization, and clinical outcomes. Aim 2 – Qualitatively assess barriers to
treatment for Veterans with alcohol misuse and CVD risk across multiple stakeholders. Aim 3 – Use a
successive cohort design to iteratively develop an intervention based on patient feedback. Aim 4 – Test the
acceptability and feasibility of an intervention to reduce alcohol misuse and CVD risk in Veterans.
Innovation: This application is highly innovative in its attempt to address for the first time: 1) perceptions of
barriers to treatment in this population, 2) the utility of a combined intervention for alcohol misuse and CVD
risk, 3) multimorbid patient preferences for timing of treatments for multiple different targets, and 4) the
sustainability of health behavior habits in VA formed by an intervention using “implementation intentions.”
Methodology: Aim 1 will use electronic health records to examine the status of key health criteria and
services utilization among Veterans with alcohol misuse, both with and without comorbid CVD risk. Aim 2
will use qualitative interviews of both Veterans with comorbid alcohol misuse and elevated modifiable CVD
risk, their providers across different settings, and systems-level stakeholders to assess current treatment
barriers. Aim 3 will employ a successive cohort design to iteratively test the proposed intervention with
rapid and early feedback from multiple Veteran cohorts. Aim 4 will test a refined intervention based on
feedback from Aims 2 and 3 to determine the acceptability to Veteran patients, as well as the feasibility of
recruitment, randomization, and intervention.
Next Steps/Implementation: Beginning in Aim 1, a systems-level advisory board will be convened semi-
annually with the goal of eliciting feedback throughout intervention development to aid implementation. By
the end of the 3rd year of the CDA-2, an IIR application will be submitted to fund a randomized comparative
effectiveness trial of the Aim 3 intervention. Results will also be presented to local Veterans engagement
panels associated with “VetREP.” Additional feedback from OCC and OMHSP operations partners, and
implementation considerations gleaned from utilization patterns and care settings in Aim 4, will allow rapid
development of a post-IIR implementation plan. Additional training in cost effectiveness and implementation
science will also give Dr. Blalock the skills to follow through with additional research and implementation."
10759453,"Immunodominance, the observation that epitopes on an antigen are not “born equal”, poses a major challenge
for next-generation vaccines against rapidly evolving pathogens. An underlying premise of this proposal is that
in order to engage in rational immunogen design for next-generation vaccines, we first need to answer a
fundamental question in immunology -- namely how to define immunodominance in biochemical and structural
terms. Rather than relying on animal models that could complicate the direct translation to human health, we will
directly sample both the circulating (plasmablasts and memory B cells) and tissue-resident (germinal center) B
cells in humans. First, we will use structural biology approaches – primarily cryo-EM – to ask what an
immunodominance map of an initial immunization looks like on a protein structure level (Aim 1). Specifically, we
will establish epitopic heatmaps of antigen-specific B cells after vaccination in humans, using SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein as a model antigen. Studies with other viruses like influenza have shown that pre-existing immunity
generated upon primary infection biases all subsequent immune responses (to infection and to vaccination). In
influenza, the issue is the immunodominance of epitopes that readily mutate (antigenic drift) and make the
seasonal reformulation of the vaccine required. In our recent study of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we noted
an original antigenic sin-like backboost to the spikes of two seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1.
Antibodies derived from the cross-reactive B cells had higher levels of mutation than did the strain-specific ones.
We therefore wish to know how pre-existing immunity, generated by preceding infection, affects immunological
memory and de novo responses to subsequent vaccination (Aim 2). We will follow the maturation of immune
responses longitudinally. We will a) determine the somatic genetic relationships among responding B cells during
primary and recall responses b) examine the resulting antibody (Ab) specificity and affinity maturation and c)
follow the evolution of immunodominance heatmaps over time across B cell compartments. Recent emergence
of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has made it clear that the virus mutates to avoid immune responses
on a population level. However, how much antigenic variation is allowed so that there is still vaccine protection
against different variants is unknown. We will concurrently follow the B responses “breakthrough infections” and
sequence the infecting strain to understand the epitopic distance that permits reinfection (Aim 3). The
overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the structural features of immune imprinting and, ultimately,
the structural correlates of Ab protection against evolving viruses. Insights gained will not only shed light on the
basic B cell biology but will also inform better vaccines. We will use SARS-CoV-2 as a model but we will extend
to other coronaviruses as probes of the immune system's ability to mount an appropriate antiviral response. A
particular strength of this proposal is the use of structural biology to gain atomic level, mechanistic understanding
of the evolution of the Ab response with direct, single-cell interrogation of B cell responses in humans."
10759456,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease caused by leishmania parasites, and exhibits a wide range of clinical
manifestations from self-healing lesions to chronic debilitating infections. Currently there are no vaccines for
this disease, and the drugs used to resolve the infections are often ineffective. Although the parasites are
important determinants of disease severity, the immune response itself causes a large amount of pathology.
CD8 T cells have been shown to play a dual role in disease by being both protective when they produce IFN-γ,
but pathogenic when they mediate inflammation-inducing cell death in lesions. We found that IFN-γ-producing
protective CD8 T cells are restricted to draining lymph nodes, whereas cytotoxic and therefore pathogenic CD8
T cells are found in leishmanial lesions in both experimental murine models of the disease and in patients. Our
preliminary results suggest that this dichotomy in CD8 T cell function is a response to the tissue
microenvironment and that protective IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells become cytolytic once they enter
leishmanial lesions. The factors involved in this conversion are unknown, and here we propose to fill this gap in
knowledge. In our first aim we will determine how the tissue microenvironment initiates the cytolytic pathway
in CD8 T cells. We will test the role of hypoxia, IL-1β and IL-15 in promoting cytolytic T cell development and
determine how heterogeneous the CD8 T cells are within the lymph nodes and lesions. In our second aim, we
will determine what induces the expression of Blimp-1, a transcription factor that regulates cytolytic T cell
function and is required for CD8 T cell-mediated disease. In addition, we will test the ability of Blimp-1 to
promote pathology by enhancing CD8 T cell recruitment to lesions. Both of these aims will provide information
helpful in designing therapies that might block the development of pathogenic CD8 T cells. Finally, in the third
aim we will evaluate the role of neutrophils and the skin microbiota in altering the skin microenvironment. Our
preliminary results suggest that neutrophils regulate O2 levels in lesions, that the microbiota amplify neutrophil
recruitment and both neutrophils and the microbiota are required for CD8 T cell-mediated disease. Overall,
these studies will provide information from murine models that will be foundational in understanding the
immune responses mediating and regulating disease in cutaneous leishmaniasis."
10759457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite new treatment modalities, the incidence of breast cancer has remained steady in recent years with
>250,000 new diagnoses and >40,000 deaths annually in the US. Concurrently, the proportion of US women
with overweight or obesity continues to rise, and is approaching 70%. Obesity and metabolic disease (which
occurs in lean and obese women) increase breast cancer incidence and worsen patient outcomes in women of
all ages. Premenopausal women with obesity are at increased risk of triple negative (TN) breast cancer (lacking
any targetable factors). Postmenopausal women with obesity incur more estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast
cancer and are more likely to develop resistance to endocrine therapies. While estrogen is clearly an important
part of this relationship, two key observations suggest that there may be estrogen-independent mechanisms at
play: 1) obesity is accompanied by worse prognosis for estrogen-independent triple negative breast cancer; and
2) anti-estrogen therapies are less effective against ER+ breast tumors in women with obesity. Regardless of
tumor subtype and menopausal status, excess weight is associated with poor outcomes for breast cancer
patients. Weight loss is known to improve breast cancer outcomes, but most people cannot sustain the standard
dietary weight loss strategies and weight regain is common. Intermittent energy restriction (IER) is a novel dietary
weight loss strategy that may have more beneficial effects on metabolic health and on breast cancer risk and
tumor progression. The work in this proposal will employ preclinical, clinical, and interventional studies, to
examine a novel mechanism of obesity-associated tumor progression and the value and feasibility of innovative
dietary interventions for eliminating obesity’s adverse effects on breast cancer.
We have merged expertise in nutrition, obesity, and medical oncology to: 1) examine a novel role that cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the tumor microenvironment (TME) may be playing in obesity-associated
tumor progression; 2) investigate if the novel dietary weight loss strategy of IER can eliminate obesity-associated
tumor progression; and 3) perform an ORBIT Phase IIa proof-of-concept study examining the ability of an IER-
based weight loss intervention to reach meaningful clinical milestones in breast cancer patients afflicted with
overweight and obesity and refine the intervention for delivery in a future randomized efficacy trial.
If the objectives of this proposal are achieved, we will have:
* Advanced our understanding of the obesity – breast cancer relationship, with evidence of a novel role for
 CAFs and the TME in obesity-associated tumor promotion for TN and ER+ breast cancer;
* Established the foundation for IER weight loss trials in breast cancer survivors, with data that will help us
 adapt these strategies to the unique characteristics and needs of this patient population; and
* Identified novel circulating biomarkers of a pro-metastatic TME, which may help identify patients most
 susceptible to metastatic disease."
10758824,"ABSTRACT
Over 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs; age 15-39 years) are diagnosed with cancer every year in
the United States, more than 8 times the number of younger patients. Survivors of AYA cancer are unique due
to their life stage and lack of appropriate services for this population (e.g., fertility preservation, insurance
coverage, and educational/vocational support). In contrast to young adult survivors of childhood cancer, little
systematic research has been conducted among survivors of AYA cancer to understand their health-related
outcomes. At diagnosis and during treatment, AYAs face delayed and limited access to appropriate care,
lower clinical trial enrollment, greater treatment-related toxicity and morbidity, and inferior survival. Early post-
treatment studies of AYA cancer survivors indicate numerous financial, social, and personal burdens
associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the long-term cancer survivorship experience
among survivors of AYA cancer is largely unexplored. Cancer during young adulthood likely leads to loss or
delay in achieving milestones of adulthood (e.g., full-time employment, financial health, marriage, having
children) following cancer treatment. Additionally, young adult Hispanic cancer survivors are understudied,
despite evidence that Hispanics experience significant differences in health-related outcomes.
Project Milestones will address these research gaps by recruiting and surveying a population-based cohort
(n=2,000, ~42% Hispanic) representing long-term (3-10 years post-diagnosis) survivors of the most prevalent
cancers found in older AYAs diagnosed between ages 21-39. Our specific aims are: (1) To assess risk and
protective factors of the achievement of milestones of adulthood and to compare achievement of milestones
between survivors of AYA cancer and non-cancer comparators; (2) To assess risk and protective factors of
long-term well-being and health related quality of life (HRQOL); and, (3) To assess risk and protective factors
of engagement in cancer-related follow-up care. For all outcomes, we will examine age, cancer type, and
ethnic differences. Among Hispanic survivors, we will examine cultural factors associated with study
outcomes.
This population-based study will include prototypical AYA cancer cases ascertained through the Los Angeles
County Cancer Surveillance Program Cancer Registry. Self-report surveys will assess milestones of
adulthood, well-being, HRQOL, and cancer-related follow-up care. Multivariable regression analyses will
identify protective and risk factors for milestones, HRQOL and cancer-related follow-up care. Comparative
analyses will identify differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic AYA survivors and between AYA cases
and non-cancer comparator participants (from the California Health Interview Survey). Results will inform the
development of guidelines and programs supporting survivors of AYA cancer, including addressing and
reducing health disparities affecting those of Hispanic ethnicity."
10778590,"This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI
acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease
risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the
characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity
is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the
hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the
observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence
of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation
in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses
this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a)
already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally
relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the
mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson),
and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn
brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this
circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this
time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated
measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the
context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop
measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such
measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as
yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal
(gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that
are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these
novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy
homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity
risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated
with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants
of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis
for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity."
10772188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to target the neurobiology underlying restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) in
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-tolerated nutritional
supplement and glutamatergic modulator that has exhibited efficacy for reducing RRB severity in recent
preliminary trials. The goals of this career developmental award are to learn the theoretical principles and develop
practical application techniques for proton spectroscopy (1H MRS) and electroencephalography (EEG)
approaches in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, learn clinical trial methodologies and develop skills
for examining treatment efficacy in controlled trials, and learn advanced statistical modeling techniques for
assessing complex treatment-related outcomes in pediatric populations. The ultimate overarching goal is to
support a promising early career investigator in transitioning to an independent research position. To achieve
these goals, we will (Aim 1) acquire 1H MRS and EEG data from children with ASD who exhibit severe RRB and
examine the ability of NAC to modulate excitatory signaling in cortico-striatal circuits (CSC) in a single dose
challenge study (NAC and placebo). We will also (Aim 2) examine the efficacy of NAC for improving RRB in a
12-week randomized controlled trial and (Aim 3) assess the ability of neurobiological measures of excitatory
signaling (1H MRS and EEG) to predict treatment response. CSC are a salient treatment target because CSC
contribute to RRB in mouse models of ASD and exhibit relationships with RRB severity in children with ASD.
Altered excitatory signaling in CSC regions have also been reported in children/adults with ASD, and most
importantly, NAC can modulate glutamatergic signaling in CSC regions. Thus, excitatory (i.e. glutamatergic)
signaling in CSC in ASD may contribute to the severity of RRB, at least for some individuals, and modulation
with NAC may confer some clinical benefits, especially for children with elevated levels at baseline. We expect
that children with ASD who receive NAC will exhibit a larger reduction in 1H MRS and EEG measures of
glutamatergic signaling compared to children who receive placebo, which will be associated with a larger
reduction in RRB severity following 12 weeks of treatment with NAC compared to placebo. We expect that
baseline measures will also be able to accurately predict which children respond to NAC and will explore the
effects of NAC on different subtypes of RRB, which may be due to different neurobiological alterations. The
findings from this research will support the efficacy of NAC for the treatment of RRB and shed light on the
mechanisms of action underlying NAC-mediated improvements. This is particularly important because there are
currently no drug treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, including RRB, and severe RRB are associated with
management challenges and barriers to adaptive learning. With this training, I plan to develop a programmatic
line of research to identify the neurobiology of specific symptoms in children with ASD and develop objective
biological markers that can be used to improve treatment-related research and help advance precision medicine."

The Extracellular Vesicle Purification and Analysis (EVPA) Core will uniquely serve the three individual projects
within the Program Project Grant. Overall, the goal of the Core is centralize the methods, expertise, equipment,
and skilled labor to perform extracellular vesicle (EV) purification, analysis, sizing, counting, and quality control.
The Core will isolate EVs by differential centrifugation and density-gradient ultracentrifugation using Optiprep/
iodixanol layering. EVs will be counted and sized using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Moreover, this Core will
perform Fluorescent Activated Vesicle Sorting (FAVS) which is based on fluorophore-conjugated antibodies to
label EV surface markers and genetically encoded fluorescent markers to label internal proteins. This technique
allows for the gating (counting) and sorting of EVs which are naturally below the diffraction limit of light based on
size. EV preparations will further be sub-fractionated based on specialized density gradients to trace EV protein
markers and RNA contents and isolate exomeres. For Project 1, this Core will purify EVs for all 3 Aims, as well
as provide EV subfractionation and FAVS EV analysis and sorting for Aim 1C. For Project 2, this Core will purify
EVs for all 3 Aims (1-3). For Project 3, this Core will utilize FAVS EV analysis and sorting and EV and exomere
purification to achieve the goals of all 3 Aims (1-3). The EVPA Core will also engage in technology development
to further develop the FAVS method to analyze single EVs based on fluorescent RNAs and RBPs, and to use
fixed, permeabilized EVs for analysis.
 In summary, the goals of the Core are to provide uniform purification and analysis practices for all 3
projects and uniquely skilled technicians and equipment in a centralized Core. As such, this structure will facilitate
extensive but timely characterization and delivery of high quality materials to investigators and drive the cutting
edge in this area."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating disease and there is no current curative treatment, with insulin being
the only product available. T1D affects not only glycemic control but also many important aspects of a patient's
life, including emotional well-being, quality of life, working ability, and social interactions29. In addition, persons
with T1D present increased risk of developing other serious complications. Therefore, there is an urgent need
to develop new cutting-edge strategies for T1D management.
The steep rise in the incidence and prevalence of T1D cannot be explained solely by genetic factors
implicating the environment, and specifically the gut microbiome, as a culprit for the disease
etiopathogenesis45. The gut microbiome influences multiple host functions, including immunity, and persons
with T1D present changes in gut microbiota associated with immunological deregulation and gut leakiness6.
Clinical studies demonstrate that fecal microbiome therapy (FMT) and probiotics can halt the progression of
new onset T1D13, corroborating the importance of the gut microbiome.
A promising and safe approach for the treatment of T1D that leverages the body’s own natural microbiome-
associated immune regulatory mechanisms is the use of resistant starches. High amylose starch (HAMS) is a
well-tolerated source of dietary fiber that modulate the gut microbiome and the host immune response. HAMS
consumption shifts the gut microbiome profile towards dietary fiber fermenters, producing the beneficial short
chain fatty acids SCFAs. However, HAMS only partially ameliorates T1D in humans. A potentially better
strategy is to use HAMS that has been esterified, releasing larger amounts of SCFAs in the intestinal tract and
eventually the circulation. Rise Therapeutics is developing R-5280, a modified version of HAMS that has been
butyrylated and acetylated. In our prior Phase 1 clinical trial enrolling adolescents with recent onset of T1D,
oral administration of R-5280 increased SCFA production leading to improved overall glycemic control. In
addition, R-5280 consumption resulted in significant increases in specific beneficial metabolites, and reduction
of inflammatory T cells. Given the limited success of prior therapeutic strategies and potential long-term risks of
immunomodulatory therapies in patients with T1D, the use of a microbiome modulating therapy like R-5280
offers a simple, safe, and inexpensive alternative approach to mitigating this devastating disease.
The goal of this proposal is to perform a confirmatory double blinded placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of
adolescents with early onset of T1D. The key aims of this proposal are: 1) compounding of R-5280 and
placebo to prepare for patient distribution; 2) execute the Phase 2 clinical trial; and 3) expand biomarker
discovery and characterization. Successful commercialization of R-5280 will provide a profound medical
advancement for treating T1D."

Disease associated with allergies such as asthma are a rising health problem with no current curative solutions.
CD4+ helper T cells (TH) that respond to common allergens play an important role in driving airway inflammation
in asthma. To better understand the diversity of T cell subsets in allergy and asthma, we analyzed the single-cell
transcriptome of ~50,000 house dust mite (HDM) allergen-reactive TH cells from asthmatics and non-asthmatics,
with and without HDM allergy. From our analysis, besides canonical clusters of cells such as TH2, TH17, and TH1,
we identified a novel subset of allergen-reactive TH cells characterized by an IFN responsive gene signature that
we called THIFNR cells (Seumois et al. Science Immunology, 2020). Proportions of THIFNR cells were
significantly increased in nonallergic individuals compared to allergic patients, suggesting an allergen-specific
host specific response even in non-allergic individuals. Moreover, the exclusive presence of the allergen-reactive
TH2 cells in the allergic patients suggests a protective role (anti-TH2 response) of the THIFNR cells in the non-
allergic patients with exposure to allergen. This potential protective role was reinforced by our in vitro studies
showing that TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) produced by THIFNR cells directly inhibits T cell
activation triggered by TCR engagement. In follow-up studies, we found THIFNR cells among viral-reactive TH
cells directed towards Flu or SARS-CoV2, suggesting a broader role of those cells in immune responses. Also,
we found THIFNR cells as a stable TH subset in a large cohort of healthy individuals. Because of the recent
discovery of THIFNR cells, very little is known about their origins, differentiation, phenotype, and function. We
hypothesize that these THIFNR HDM-reactive T cells could play a role through TRAIL engagement in dampening
TH2 inflammation in allergy and asthma.
In Aim 1, we will define the functional properties of THIFNR cells. We will perform co-culture experiments to test
the ability of THIFNR cells to inhibit proliferation and function of TH2 cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner. In Aim
2 we will determine optimal conditions to induce differentiation of THIFNR cells in vitro and compare their
functional properties with those generated in vivo. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine if HDM-reactive THIFNR
cells show persistence and plasticity in vivo. We will perform single-cell TCR sequencing of HDM-reactive
THIFNR cells and other memory CD4+ T cell subsets isolated from longitudinally collected blood samples of HDM
allergic and non-allergic subjects. By comparing TCR repertoire in longitudinal samples, we will assess
persistence of THIFNR cells in vivo. Overall, functional studies in this R21 program will provide important insights
into this novel CD4+ T cell subset; and form the basis of a future R01 application to conduct studies translating
findings to the clinic."

Colony Genetics Core
Genetic characterization of animals in the Yerkes specific pathogen free (SPF) breeding colony is conducted by
the Colony Genetics Core. Our efforts are focused on preserving genetic diversity through breeding and
identifying animals suitable for AIDS research assignment. The Colony Genetics Core recently transitioned
most wet-bench workflows onto liquid-handling robots and switched to a sample labeling strategy that facilitates
realtime tracking and automation. We developed and maintain several purpose-built tools that comprise our
analytical framework for defining genetic parentage, calculating genetic value, and developing breeding
recommendations. We make these tools, and all genetics datasets and analyses, available to the YNPRC
community and others through a web-based resource that we developed, Colony Informatics.
Across three Specific Aims, we will continue to ensure that animals are expeditiously genotyped for AIDS-related
assignment and to prioritize animals for retention as breeders. We will also begin to incorporate comprehensive
genetic characterization of breeders through exome sequencing. Altogether, our efforts are highly collaborative
and integrative; we routinely work with the other SPF cores, veterinarians, and investigators to ensure that the
needs of the colony are readily met.
Specific Aim 1: Provide breeding recommendations based on parentage and genetic value genotyping.
Specific Aim 2: Perform allele-specific genotyping for AIDS research assignment.
Specific Aim 3: Perform primatized exome sequencing of new breeders to surveil for new alleles.
Taken together, these proposed aims will ensure the genetic diversity and sustainability of the Yerkes SPF
colony for years to come."
10752617,"Of the 33,330 men who died from prostate cancer in United States last year, over 80% of these patients
presented with localized disease. Thus, a majority of PCa patients are diagnosed at a potentially curable stage
and are often treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Following RP, patients with aggressive disease face the
risk of prostate cancer recurrence, which manifests as persistently elevated or increasing serum PSA. While
salvage radiation therapy (RT) represents a standard treatment option for post-surgical recurrences, it results in
long-term disease control in only 30-40% of patients. Thus, the post-surgical recurrence state presents multiple
opportunities to improve patient care by addressing three critical challenges: (1) determining which patients will
benefit from the addition of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), (2) identifying which patients treated with RT
and ADT will require further treatment intensification, and (3) identifying the appropriate treatment intensification
strategy for RT and ADT treated patients. Since androgen-directed therapies represent the backbone of
treatment for PCa (that have progressed through local therapies) the RTOG 96-01 and RTOG 05-34 phase III
clinical trials represent a unique resource of banked prostatectomy cohorts from patients that were randomized
to the presence or absence of treatment with ADT. For patients whose clinical and pathologic features place
them at highest risk of dying from PCa, these landmark trials have defined the standard of care by showing that
the addition of ADT to RT resulted in significant improvements to patient survival compared to RT alone. This
presents an unparalleled opportunity to develop and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers addressing
multiple unmet clinical needs throughout patient care following surgery. Aim 1 will focus on using high-throughput
DNA and RNA sequencing to develop a predictive classifier for identifying which patients would benefit from ADT
using patients from RTOG 96-01 and 05-34. In Aim 2 we will develop and validate a prognostic classifier that
integrates genomic and clinicopathologic data for PCa patients treated with RT+ADT that may benefit from
treatment intensification. Aim 3 will focus on identifying RT+ADT patients requiring treatment intensification that
could benefit from receiving pelvic lymph node radiation therapy using patients from RTOG 05-34. The proposed
study would have significant impact by developing and optimizing prognostic and predictive biomarkers that
could have enormous potential for rapid clinical translation to personalize therapy and transform the
management of PCa patients following surgery."
10752620,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cisplatin is a well-known chemotherapy that results in a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI),
occurring in up to one in three adults receiving a single dose. Despite efforts to find less toxic but equally
effective alternatives, platin-based therapies are still incorporated in up to 40% of chemotherapy regimens, and
remain first-line treatment for a number of cancers. AKI occurring after oncologic treatments such as cisplatin
is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; it is therefore of paramount importance to identify
effective strategies aimed at prevention of cisplatin-associated AKI (CP-AKI).
 In Aim 1, we will examine the effect of 4 medications (Intravenous [IV] magnesium [Mg], mannitol,
metformin, and statins) on the incidence of CP-AKI. We will leverage a unique database of >45,000 adult
patients treated with IV cisplatin at 4 major cancer centers, applying the principles of target trial emulation to
address common biases in observational studies.
 In Aim 2, we will build upon animal models showing the protective effects of IV Mg on CP-AKI and our own
preliminary data showing that lower serum Mg levels are independently associated with AKI in cardiac surgery
patients. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in mesothelioma patients receiving hyperthermic
intraoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin (HIOCC) (n=80) comparing IV Mg to placebo for the attenuation of
CP-AKI. We will collect blood and urine samples pre- and postoperatively, comparing changes in serum
creatinine and novel markers of tubular injury between the two groups.
 In Aim 3, we will recruit 150 high-risk patients receiving IV cisplatin to examine whether a byproduct of the
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pathway, urinary quinolinate normalized to tryptophan, is elevated
in CP-AKI. If so, administration of agents directed at increasing NAD+ metabolites may be a promising
preventative strategy for CP-AKI in future studies.
 The projects proposed in this K23 application will provide the training needed to 1) become an expert in
onco-nephrology; 2) apply advanced epidemiologic techniques to observational datasets; 3) develop skills in
prospective patient recruitment; 4) build a biobank; 5) and acquire skills in the conduct of RCTs. The PI has
guidance from mentors Dr. David Leaf, an expert in AKI, RCTs, biomarkers, and onco-nephrology, as well as
Dr. Deborah Schrag, a world-renowned oncologist, outcomes researcher, and clinical trialist. The PI has
assembled an advisory committee of experts in causal inference, Mg homeostasis, statistics, and translational

colorectal and endometrial cancers with extremely high levels of hypermutation. The mechanism through which
Pole variants cause hypermutability remains puzzling. Because amino acid residues in the exonuclease
domain are preferentially affected, POLE mutations were originally thought to act by inactivating exonucleolytic
proofreading. However, subsequent research by our laboratory challenged this concept. Mutator effects of
cancer-associated variants in model systems greatly exceed the effect of proofreading deficiency (in the case
of the most recurrent variant, P286R - by two orders of magnitude). PoleP286R mice were also found to be much
more cancer-prone than proofreading-deficient Pole mice. Thus, factors other than loss of exonuclease must
be responsible for the elevated mutagenesis and cancer risk. The goal of this application is to decipher the
mechanisms that drive genomic instability in POLE-mutant tumors. Preliminary studies led us to propose that,
for many Pole exonuclease domain variants, the main consequence is not merely the loss of exonuclease but a
dramatically increased DNA polymerase activity, which affects the overall contribution of Pole to replication and
interferes with the function of other mutation avoidance mechanisms. This is a highly innovative hypothesis,
since it defines POLE variants in tumors as gain-of-function variants rather than loss-of-function as was
previously thought. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use purified
four-subunit Pole to characterize the biochemical effects of cancer-associated mutations. In Aim 2, we will
define the mechanisms of the mutator effects of Pole variants in proliferating cells. These studies will help
understand the etiology of a significant proportion of colorectal and endometrial cancers and may pinpoint new
targets for the development of personalized therapies for POLE mutation carriers. The biochemical and cell-
based assays we will establish in the course of this work will also be instrumental for assessing the functional
significance of multiple poorly understood POLE variants detected in tumors."

Globally, over 50% of those infected with HIV are women, and annually, ~50% of all pregnancies are unintended.
Therefore, there is a critical need to promote female-controlled methods of multipurpose prevention and delivery
strategies that can be disassociated from the sex act. Intravaginal rings are well tolerated by women, are
efficacious for contraception and hormone replacement therapy, and have high patient acceptability and
compliance 1-4. However, developing effective multipurpose IVRs is challenging due to the limitations of current
engineering processes 5-6, and differences in drug properties and release rates, thus mandating drug-specific
customized IVR designs. Our goal is to address these limitations by revolutionizing the engineering process of
intravaginal rings using a state-of-the-art 3D printing process known as the continuous liquid interface production
(CLIP™)7. Using CLIP, we can engineer IVRs with complex geometries that cannot be achieved with traditional
injection molding or extrusion. The complex geometries within the ring will allow us to precisely fine-tune diffusion
and release of drugs from the IVR, and achieve near complete release of drugs from the IVR. More importantly,
with CLIP, we can manufacture multipurpose IVRs that can integrate 2 or more drugs to prevent against
unintended pregnancies and STIs (HIV, HSV-2, HPV) in a rapid and cost effective single-step process. In this
NGM R01 grant and building on our existing data, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of this innovative
approach using highly relevant animal models as invaluable preclinical tools to assess the safety and
pharmacokinetic profiles of 3D CLIP MPT. This cutting edge combined approach will be utilized to evaluate the
scientific premise of our proposal in sheep and macaques to investigate the safety and efficacy of a unique and
highly innovative 3D printed multipurpose IVR technology."
10752635,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to study the NMDA-subtype (NMDARs) of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and their
regulation by NRAP-1, the first identified NMDAR-specific auxiliary protein, which we recently discovered in a
genetic screen for modifiers of NMDAR-mediated behavior in C. elegans. NMDARs are evolutionarily
conserved and well known for their role in synaptic plasticity, i.e., long-term potentiation (LTP); their importance
for cellular models of learning and memory; and their direct or indirect involvement in many neurological and
psychiatric disorders. Although NRAP-1 modifies the function of postsynaptic NMDARs, we showed that it was
released by presynaptic glutamatergic neurons. This discovery provided a major conceptual advance in our
understanding of the regulation of NMDAR-mediated synaptic signaling, with implications for both the control of
synaptic strength and for certain clinical disorders involving NMDARs. In preliminary experiments, we
successfully obtained crystals of recombinantly produced NRAP-1 and determined the crystal structure at 1.9
Å resolution. Elucidating the structure of NRAP-1 has provided important new insight into how NRAP-1
modifies NMDAR function. By studying vertebrate and C. elegans NMDARs, we have also demonstrated a
fundamental importance for the NMDAR amino-terminal domain (ATD) with respect to both receptor gating and
to the mechanism of action of NRAP-1. We now plan to build on this foundational work and ask how NRAP-1
functions to modulate NMDAR function, i.e., what are the interactions between NRAP-1 and NMDARs, and
how do these interactions change receptor kinetics? In contrast to overexpression of NMDARs, we discovered
that overexpression of NRAP-1 in vivo significantly increased NMDAR-mediated currents and behavior. This
has important implications for the control of synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, we found that NRAP-1 is actively
transported along neural processes. Together, these findings suggest that modulating NRAP-1 secretion might
be a mechanism used to regulate activity dependent changes in synaptic strength. Therefore, we will address
the molecular requirements for the transport and secretion of NRAP-1. The relevance of our proposed studies
is high because disorders of NMDAR-mediated signaling are implicated in synaptopathies associated with
neurodegenerative disorders as well as for mental health illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression.
Synaptic molecules are evolutionarily conserved, and our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate
synaptic signaling has greatly benefited from genetics-based studies in invertebrates such as Drosophila and
C. elegans. Notably, NMDARs and NRAP-1-like proteins appear to have co-evolved suggesting that vertebrate
NMDARs are likely regulated by auxiliary proteins. We therefore anticipate that our planned studies will help
provide a framework for a new mechanistic understanding of NMDARs centered on protein-protein
interactions."
10752663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer characterized by high rates of chromosome mis-segre-
gation during cell division. CIN can generate nuclear aberrations termed micronuclei when a chromosome or
chromosome fragment lags during anaphase and fails to join the main chromatin mass that will form the prima-
ry nucleus. Micronuclei recruit nuclear envelopes but defects in construction lead to frequent rupturing, loss of
compartmentalization, and an unregulated exchange of proteins and small vesicles with the cytoplasm. Mi-
cronuclear envelope rupturing causes broad dysfunction and is associated with extensive DNA damage and
genomic rearrangements, including clustered mutational phenomena such as chromothripsis and kataegis,
which are commonly observed in cancer genomes. Ruptured micronuclei can also activate the pro-inflammato-
ry cGAS-STING pathway, which plays essential roles in anti-tumor immunity. These observations suggest that
micronuclei may represent key platforms for genome evolution and immune activation in cancer. The mecha-
nisms driving DNA damage and immune activation at micronuclei are poorly understood. The laboratory dis-
covered that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated exonuclease TREX1, which is mutated in a variety of
human immune diseases including Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome, accumulates at micronuclei upon micronu-
clear envelope rupture where it resects micronuclear DNA and limits cGAS-STING activation. Therefore,
TREX1 occupies central positions in key pathways with diverse roles in human health and disease. Conse-
quently, there is strong rationale to understand mechanisms of TREX1 activity and engagement with cytosolic
DNA. The long-term goals of the laboratory are to determine mechanisms of DNA damage, clustered mutage-
nesis, and immune activation at sites of nuclear envelope rupture. The specific Aims of this proposal are to 1)
Elucidate mechanisms of TREX1 structure and function, 2) Determine how TREX1 is recruited to micronuclei,
and 3) Dissect pathways of micronuclear DNA damage. Each objective is supported by extensive preliminary
data. Aim 1 will focus on a previously uncharacterized region in TREX1, which is essential for its ability to de-
grade cytosolic DNA and inhibit cGAS activation. Aim 2 will build on results showing that TREX1 DNA binding
function is dispensable for its localization to micronuclei, while its association with the ER is essential. Aim 3
will use a new method to purify micronuclei to dissect sources of micronuclear DNA damage. Taken together,
these data will provide fundamental insights into cancer genome evolution, explain how previously uncharac-
terized TREX1 mutations cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, and may identify new strategies to improve anti-
tumor immunity."

[YTW]) youths (ages 15-24 years) at risk of and living with HIV are poorly represented in international
implementation science (IS) research. The overarching goal of Resilient HIV Implementation Science with
SGM Youths using Evidence (RISE) Clinical Research Center is to make significant contributions to the
development and conduct of IS studies to improve HIV prevention and care continuum (PHCC). A strategic
planning process including a comprehensive review of our CRC's role in accelerating and maximizing the
integration of digital health into practice, increasing the scientific capacity for IS research with SGM youths,
translating findings to inform national and global guidelines on clinical management of SGM youths was
conducted to inform this proposal. A vision statement encompassing four Themes – Equity in Partnerships
for Access, Youth-tailored Intervention, Rigor IS Research, and Collaboration Capacity for
Sustainability shapes our work. The RISE Clinical Research Center is a multidisciplinary research group
composed of an administrative core at the University of Maryland Baltimore and five clinical research
performing sites (CRPSs) that represent a network of implementing partners and community-based HIV
service providers (CBSPs) in West, East, and Southern Africa: (1) Centre for Population Health Initiatives,
Nigeria (CPHI); (2) Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria (IHVN); (3) Partners for Health & Development in
Africa, Kenya (PHDA); (4) Centre for the Development of People (CEDEP); and (5) Center for International
Health Education Biosecurity, Zambia (Ciheb Zambia). Together, we have over fifteen years of leadership
experience in the design, implementation, and conduct of health service studies with SGM youths in SSA and
the United States (US). Under the leadership of the multiple PIs, Man Charurat Ph.D, Lisa Hightow-Weidman

 The sensory receptors for mammalian vestibular organs, called hair cells, encode head movements
and relay information along the vestibular nerve to the brainstem and cerebellum. Mammals have two types of
hair cell, type I and type II, which different morphological and physiological properties. Type I and II hair cells
also have distinct forms of afferent innervation that are differentially distributed across the epithelial zones.
Vestibular hair cells die during normal aging and after exposure to ototoxins, and this loss can lead to profound
vestibular deficits. After vestibular hair cell damage in adult mice, supporting cells regenerate ~50% of type ll
hair cells, but no type I hair cells are replaced. This natural hair cell regeneration does not restore the
vestibular system to normal function, as measured by the vestibulo-ocular reflex and other behavioral tests.
One interpretation of this finding is that type I hair cells must be replaced in mammals for vestibular function to
return. While this is tempting to speculate, there is little evidence that type I hair cells are required for specific
vestibular functions. Indeed, we understand little about the respective contributions of type I and II hair cells to
our vestibular sense.
 One step toward solving this puzzle is to use molecular biology to better understand the unique
features of each hair cell type and to determine if subtypes of type I and II hair cells exist. Working with Drs.
Neil Segil and Litao Tao, I found from single cell RNA sequencing that there seem to be four molecularly
distinct populations of hair cells in adult mouse utricles: two type l-like populations, one type ll-like population,
and one unknown group of hair cells. In Aim 1, I will continue these studies, examining expression of
candidate cell-specific genes in all vestibular organs to determine if four distinct hair cell groups are identifiable
in each organ and how these groups are distributed across epithelial zones. I will generate novel insights into
hair cell features across vestibular organs, classify new markers for each cell type, and identify genes that may
be used to drive cell-selective gene misexpression in future studies. Another step toward testing the different
functions of type I and II hair cells is to remove each hair cell population and assess impacts on vestibular
function. In Aim 2, I will use CreLoxP technology to ablate all type I hair cells or peripheral type I hair cells in
all adult vestibular organs. I will determine the impact of these ablations upon animal behaviors and brainstem
electrical responses to vestibular stimuli, which to my knowledge has not been done before in adult mice. I
expect to gain new insights into the general function of type I hair cells and the specific functions of type I hair
cells in each epithelial zone. Overall, this research provides new information about properties and functions of
type I and II hair cells and inform on new therapies to treat balance disorders. Further, this project enables me
to receive top-notch research training in a collaborative setting using cutting-edge scientific approaches."

Bacteria in the human microbiome produce a complex pool of bioactive small molecules that have been
associated with effects on human biology in health and disease, but the mechanisms of action of these molecules
remain largely undefined. This proposal builds on preliminary data that a microbiome-derived small molecule,
the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA), induces the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a signaling
pathway that responds to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This observation links a microbiome-derived small
molecule to a basic aspect of host cell biology. In this proposal, the applicant seeks to bring this observation to
the mechanistic level using three complementary aims. In Aim 1, the consequences of LCA-mediated UPR
activation will be defined in physiological models of liver homeostasis and injury. In Aim 2, the molecular
mechanism by which LCA induces the UPR will be dissected using a combination of in-depth monitoring of ER
function and chemical and genetic perturbations to probe the roles of putative signaling pathways and receptors.
In Aim 3, the broader scope of UPR induction by bile acids, both individually and in combinations, will be
assessed using high-throughput assays and animal models.
Together, this work will establish the molecular basis of UPR induction by microbiome-derived small molecules.
Dysregulation of the UPR is implicated in metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and multiple forms
of cancer. Thus, this work may inform the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for such
diseases. More broadly, this work will provide a blueprint to define how small molecules from the microbiome
shape host biology by impacting fundamental cell biological processes.
Harvard Medical School houses world leaders in biomedical research in a collaborative and multidisciplinary
environment and contains cutting-edge facilities for microscopy, genomics, and proteomics that will support the
proposed research. The co-sponsors Dr. Marco Jost and Dr. Wade Harper are experts in studying host-
microbiome interactions and regulation proteostasis, respectively, and provide complementary technical
expertise and mentoring viewpoints. Completion of the proposed research will directly support the applicant’s
training goals, including training in microbiome biology, systematic genetics, and animal models of disease and
growth of skills to support an academic career."
10929997,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcription is an essential and tightly regulated process that requires the coordination of many factors to
ensure proper gene expression. Current models of transcription are predicated on stable, hierarchical
interactions. These models have been challenged through recent developments in in vivo imaging, which have
revealed that many transcriptional regulatory proteins interact transiently with chromatin. Instead of relying on
stability, occupancy at target loci is achieved through more frequent interactions resulting from the formation of
high local-concentration assemblies within nuclei, called hubs. Little is known about the functional impacts of
hub formation on transcription, how hubs alter the kinetics of regulatory proteins and how hubs function in cancer,
human expansion repeat disease, and other diseases. Previous studies largely rely on the ectopic
overexpression of proteins of interest and qualitative assays to study hub function and there is a of lack of both
specific strategies to perturb hub formation/properties with a measurable functional output and application of
suitable technologies to look at protein kinetics in vivo. The goal of this project is to use oncogenic mutations
found in the chromatin reader protein, ENL, to elucidate the mechanisms by which hubs impact transcription.
ENL mutations are among the first examples of pathogenic mutations that result in aberrant hub formation.
Importantly, such hub formation is functionally required for hyper-activation of target genes. The high specificity
and gain-of-function nature of ENL mutations make them a powerful system to study both the mechanisms of
hub formation as well as how aberrant hubs contribute to human disease. I hypothesize that ENL mutant proteins
promote the clustering of multiple elements, both genomic and proteomic, to alter transcription at target loci. In
Aim 1, I will combine advanced imaging techniques, including single molecule tracking and live imaging of
transcription, to determine the effect of hub formation on the molecular kinetics of incorporated proteins and
transcription dynamics. In Aim 2, I will investigate the effect of hub formation on the spatial proximity of target
genes using DNA-FISH and live imaging to determine if hubs drive genome reorganization for coordinated
expression of target loci. Completion of this project will offer novel insights as to how pathogenic mutations result
in aberrant hub formation and affect transcriptional dynamics to drive disease. More broadly, this work will
advance our understanding of hub-mediated gene regulation, revealing the potential for novel therapeutic
strategies to target gene dysregulation in disease."
10912526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During postnatal developmental stages known as critical periods (CPs), sensory experience acts upon a
genetically-hardwired connectivity map to sculpt the neocortical circuitry that enables mammalian functioning.
Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism disrupt this experience-dependent plasticity and compromise
the development of social, cognitive, and physical function. Since autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients
suffer from tactile hyper- or hypo-sensitivity that may reflect abnormal development of sensory circuits, ASD is
commonly studied in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In addition, the mouse whisker S1 is a somatotopic
map of the mouse whisker pad, so manipulation of specific whiskers induces observable functional changes in
the corresponding barrels of S1. Morphological and physiological studies of experience-dependent plasticity in
S1 have revealed several CPs and elucidated the influence of ASD on their emergence in mouse models of
autism. However, the gene expression programs underlying experience-dependent plasticity and the
influence of ASD on it remain unknown at the resolution of S1’s 100+ transcriptomically distinct cell
types. Since these cell types form the circuits that carry out sensory function, it is important to study the
influence of experience and ASD on their maturation. This project combines single-nucleus mRNA sequencing
(snRNA-seq) and computational biology approaches rooted in machine learning with temporally resolved
whisker manipulations and a mouse model of ASD to test two hypotheses. To test the hypothesis that whisker
experience is required for cell type development in S1, snRNA-seq will be performed at several time points
spanning two established CPs in whisker-deprived and control mice. Unsupervised and supervised machine
learning approaches such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, graph embedding, and classification will be
used to identify transcriptomic cell types at each time point and assess the influence of whisker experience on
their maturation. Hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization (HCR-FISH) will enable the
validation of cell type-specific development patterns. To test the hypothesis that ASD disrupts
experience-dependent cell type maturation, snRNA-seq will be performed on Fmr1 KO mice under whisker
deprivation and control conditions. Fmr1 KO models Fragile X syndrome, the most frequent monogenic cause
of intellectual disability and ASD in humans. While Fmr1 deletion has been shown to delay the maturation of
circuits in S1 during a CP, its influence on experience-dependent maturation of S1 cell types remains unknown.
Comparing gene expression profiles and cell types between KO and wild-type mice with and without
whisker-deprivation will reveal transcriptomic signatures of ASD and pinpoint the cell types in which its effects
are localized. Knowledge generated from this study about the manifestation of ASD in transcriptomic cell types
will improve understanding of ASD pathology and reveal candidate cell types for targeted treatment."

Macrophages are among the earliest immune cells present during fetal development. Different populations of
macrophages have distinct functions, with early yolk sac derived macrophages having an immune tolerant
function and later liver derived macrophages having a more robust inflammatory profile. In the mouse lung, the
inflammatory profile of liver derived macrophages increases late in development and peaks around the time of
birth. This pro-inflammatory phenotype of fetal macrophages conflicts with previous notions that the fetal
immune system resides solely in a tolerant state. Inflammatory macrophages may function to protect the
developing fetus and newborn from pathogens encountered right at birth, but might also contribute to
inflammatory disease pathogenesis, particularly in infants born preterm. We hypothesize that newly formed
macrophages arising from the fetal liver are programmed for inflammation via the IKKb/NF-kB pathway.
However, once macrophages travel to various organs in the developing fetus, they may adopt tissue-specific
features. This proposal will use state of the art, complementary approaches to measure developmental
changes in the immune signature of fetal macrophages within developing mouse tissues. Experiments using
knockout mice will test if canonical IKKb/NF-kB signaling is required for the pro-inflammatory phenotype. While
the myelopoietic cytokine GM-CSF is known to promote alveolar macrophage differentiation in the lung after
birth, our preliminary data suggest it may also regulate the inflammatory phenotype in fetal lung macrophages.
Studies using Csf2 (the gene encoding GM-CSF) knockout mice will test the requirement of GM-CSF on the
developing lung immune system and specifically macrophages. The project will bring together experts in
developmental immunology and computational modeling and employ novel, cutting edge approaches to
complex systems immunology. The results generated by this proposal will fill a significant gap in our
understanding of the fetal immune system and the unique functional properties of macrophages protecting
newborns."
10912510,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer. Few treatment options exist for patients with metastatic disease.
Upon tumorigenesis, melanoma cells invade into dermal and subcutaneous tissues and then eventually
metastasize to distant organs, encountering and interacting with various microenvironmental cell types. The
tumor microenvironment plays a significant role in melanoma progression. Lipid-laden cells called adipocytes
are located in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Recent work from our lab demonstrated that adipocytes
serve as a source of fatty acids that fuel melanoma growth and invasion. Although melanoma tumors are often
in direct contact with adipocytes, the mechanism of melanoma-adipocyte communication is unclear. Our
preliminary data identify the presence of gap junctions between melanoma cells and adipocytes. These data
point to Adipocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ACAM) as a potential mediator of melanoma-adipocyte adhesion.
In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanism of melanoma-adipocyte adhesion and its role in tumor
progression. ACAM mediates cell-cell adhesion through homophilic binding. Our own data show that ACAM is
upregulated in melanoma cells that are co-cultured with adipocytes. Loss of ACAM in melanoma cells
abrogates gap junctional communication with adipocytes. We hypothesize that ACAM is a key regulator of
melanoma-adipocyte contact and communication. Using human melanoma cell lines and adipocytes in a
co-culture system, we will identify changes in melanoma-adipocyte adhesion and cell-cell communication upon
knock out of ACAM. We will engineer adipocyte-restricted ACAM knockout zebrafish to delineate the effects of
adipocyte-specific ACAM loss on tumor progression. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism and
functional consequences of melanoma-adipocyte gap junctions. Gap junctions mediate the transfer of
ions, small metabolites, and secondary messengers such as cAMP, a key activator of lipolysis, between
neighboring cells. We hypothesize that melanoma-adipocyte gap junctions facilitate the direct transfer of
signaling molecules between coupled cells, ultimately activating tumor-promoting pathways such as
lipolysis. To gain insight into the molecular basis for melanoma-adipocyte gap junctions, we will first identify
the connexin(s) composition of these channels. We will also study the role of melanoma-adipocyte gap
junctions in lipolysis and tumor progression using an in vivo zebrafish subcutaneous transplant model. By
investigating how melanoma cells interact with adjacent adipocytes, we seek to delineate the impact of
adipocytes on tumor progression and identify novel therapeutic targets of the tumor microenvironment."
10889055,"Infertility effects around 15% of couples that are of reproductive age worldwide. Issues relating to infertility often
arise due to errors in the process of meiosis, the specialized cell division where a single diploid cell gives rise to
four haploid gametes. The general sequence of events in meiosis includes one round of DNA replication, the
separation of homologous chromosomes (meiosis I), and then the separation of sister chromatids (meiosis II).
During the process of chromosome segregation, the cell organizes bipolar spindles to evenly divide the genetic
material. Like most mitotically dividing cells, spermatocytes rely on the centrosome to be the microtubule
organizing center responsible for the formation of bipolar spindles. The centrosome consists of two centrioles
and associated proteins known as pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles are cylindrical organelles that exist
in pairs, one centriole oriented perpendicular to the other. The PCM that surrounds them consists of ordered,
dynamic proteins that are necessary for cellular functions such as protein degradation, organelle trafficking, and
spindle assembly. The PCM also acts as the spindle organizing center by concentrating the γ-tubulin that serves
as nucleation sites for assembling the microtubules necessary for bipolar spindle formation and chromosome
segregation. During cellular division, centriole duplication occurs. Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is responsible for
this duplication event in mitosis. PLK4 is regulated through autophosphorylation and proteasomal degradation
to ensure centriole duplication only occurs once during the cell cycle. However, in meiosis the cell must undergo
centriole duplication twice and centriole duplication is no longer coupled with DNA synthesis, but rather takes
place during prophase I and interkinesis. Furthermore, PLK4 protein levels remain high during spermatogenesis
and its activity is likely regulated by a novel mechanism. Because of this added complexity, the role of PLK4 in
relationship to centriole duplication during meiosis is not yet understood. To determine the role of PLK4 in
meiosis, conditional knockout (cKO) and overexpression (OE) mouse models, which allow for depletion or
upregulation of PLK4 in early prophase spermatocytes, are utilized. In the Plk4 cKO model, due to the lack of
functional PLK4, centrioles fail to duplicate, and the spermatocytes enter meiosis I with a single centrosome. In
contrast, centrioles are over duplicated in the Plk4 OE model. It is our goal to utilize these models to further
characterize the role of PLK4 as well as elucidate other regulatory mechanisms and components required for
centrosome biogenesis during mammalian spermatogenesis. As centrosome biogenesis is critical for
chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis, and centrioles are required for sperm flagella formation, our
studies will contribute to understanding causes of infertility and gamete aneuploidy. We will address the following
aims in this proposal:
Aim 1: Determine novel aspects of bipolar spindle formation during mammalian spermatogenesis
Aim 2: Explore the regulatory mechanisms required for centriole duplication during mammalian spermatogenesis"
10904672,"Project Summary:
The field of geroscience has identified multiple genetic, pharmaceutical, and lifestyle interventions
that promote longevity and delay the onset of age-related disease. One of the most studied of these
interventions is Dietary Restriction (DR), or a reduction in nutrient intake that does not cause
malnutrition. DR can extend lifespan and healthspan across taxa, and many of the genetic
mechanisms of DR were originally discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
Unfortunately, dietary restriction is not a realistic solution to prevent age-related disease on a
population level because following a DR protocol is very difficult for most people and because the
benefits of DR can be blunted by environmental factors. For example, exposing fasted animals to
food smells decreases the efficacy of DR in multiple model organisms. In C. elegans, food smells are
perceived by sensory neurons that initiate circuits leading to neurotransmitter release from
serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. Signaling from these bioamine neurotransmitters ultimately
conveys food availability information to the intestine through cell nonautonomous signaling. In the
intestine, this signal suppresses the expression of fmo-2, a gene required for DR-mediated longevity.
In the preliminary data collected for this proposal, we found that a second mode of food perception,
mechanosensation of food, also suppresses DR-mediated fmo-2 induction and longevity in C.
elegans. Much like food smell, mechanosensory suppression of DR requires the production of
bioamine neurotransmitters to drive cell nonautonomous regulation of peripheral longevity genes.
This project will identify key neurons and signaling components of the cell nonautonomous signaling
pathway through which mechanosensory food perception regulates aging. To map this circuit, I will
first identify the dopaminergic and tyraminergic neurons activated by mechanosensory food
perception and determine whether mechanosensation increases or suppresses release of these
neurotransmitters (Aim 1). Next, I will investigate elements of this pathway downstream of
bioaminergic neurons by 1) determining the bioamine receptor-expressing interneurons directly
downstream of the bioaminergic signal, and 2) identifying neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors
through which information about the food environment is conveyed to the intestine (Aim 2). Together,
these aims will enhance our understanding of how different modes of food perception regulate aging
through conserved signaling elements. Ultimately, we can use this information to create
pharmaceuticals that mimic the benefits of dietary restriction regardless of environmental food cues."

Twenty percent of Americans die of cancer. This alarming statistic reflects a major human health need for novel
cancer therapeutics. Small molecule mimics of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) represent an emerging new class of
immunotherapeutic cancer drugs, and numerous cGAMP-mimics have been entered into clinical trials in the last
three years. Unfortunately, due to their unusually complex structure, these clinical candidates are exceptionally
difficult to prepare via classic synthetic methodology, which serves as a limitation to their development. Recent
advances in biocatalysis, however, indicate significant opportunity to simplify the synthesis of cGAMP-mimics.
The enzyme that naturally produces cGAMP is called cGAMP synthase (cGAS), and preliminary results suggest
that engineering of cGAS may provide a way to access diverse cGAMP-mimics through a highly direct process.
This proposal aims to develop biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis of cGAMP-mimics using natural and
engineered cGAS variants. As over 500 sequences of cGAS enzymes have been catalogued from nature, there
is already a large protein library from which to develop an expanded biocatalytic lexicon for the synthesis of
cGAMP-mimics. There are three major challenges in the synthesis of unnatural cGAMP-mimics that will be ad-
dressed by this fellowship, which aims to 1) build a panel of cGAS enzymes with non-native nucleobase toler-
ance, 2) create stereocomplementary catalysts for phosphorothioate centers, and 3) engineer cGAS to create
atypical constitutional isomers of cGAMP. It is our hypothesis that novel reactivity and selectivity can be realized
through a two-phase iterative interrogation of cGAS proteins: high-throughput screening of a library of cGAS
enzymes against a reference target followed by engineering of the most successful variants. Insights from this
work will afford an increased knowledge of the specific structural features of cGAS that govern nucleobase tol-
erance, phosphorus-centered stereoselectivity, and site-selectivity in macrocyclization. This work will enable sci-
entists to develop tomorrow’s immunotherapeutic cancer drugs more rapidly."

greater than 12 months yields the greatest benefits,19,34,39 more than 50% of patients discontinue early.40,41
Patients who discontinue face substantially heightened risk of all-cause hospitalization, emergency department

Significance: What explains this high rate of discontinuation has not been well studied.20,21 Prior research,

younger age, minoritized race-ethnicity, male birth sex, higher pain interference and low buprenorphine
dose,4,10-11,25 but why or how such factors are linked with early discontinuation remains unknown. Research
probing the patient perspective is limited, drawing upon patients in clinical trials or small, homogenous

Innovation & Impact: Design and methodological innovations of the proposed study include: the national
scope of the sample; oversampling rural Veterans, women and Veterans of minoritized race and ethnicity in
surveys and interviews, and triangulating patient and provider interviews and survey data to understand areas
of convergence and divergence in perceptions regarding discontinuation decisions and treatment encounters.
The overall impact of this study is high because it will collect novel data that will identify modifiable factors that
inhibit patient retention in treatment, which can be used to develop interventions to improve retention, reduce
risk of relapse and improve the overall health and well-being of Veterans with OUD.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Surveys with a national sample of (N=965) Veterans prescribed buprenorphine for OUD paired with
administrative data and medical record review will identify modifiable patient-, provider- and system-level
factors predictive of buprenorphine discontinuation within 12-months of initiation.
Aim 2. Interviews with a national sample of patients (N=40) who recently discontinued buprenorphine and their
buprenorphine care provider (N=40) will investigate motivations for discontinuation and perspectives on the
process.
Methodology: We propose a prospective cohort study utilizing a convergent parallel mixed-methods design to
obtain complementary quantitative survey and qualitative interview data. We will enroll a national sample of
N=965 Veterans initiating buprenorphine, stratifying sampling to ensure diversity in terms of race, ethnicity,
birth sex and rural versus urban residence of patients enrolled. Longitudinal quantitative surveys at baseline, 6
and 12 months will obtain patient-reported data unavailable in administrative records to identify modifiable
barriers to treatment retention and learn about patient experiences sustaining versus discontinuing
buprenorphine. Administrative data supplemented by medical record review will identify provider and system-
level factors associated with early discontinuation. Qualitative interviews with a subset of discontinuing
patients, and the clinicians with whom they are paired, will identify motivations for, and experiences with,
discontinuation, and contextualize results obtained from survey and medical record review.
Next Steps/Implementation: Information obtained through this study will provide a foundation from which to
develop interventions targeting patients and providers that address the modifiable causes of early
discontinuation."

In the United States, 47% of adults 30 years or older are affected by periodontal disease, and this rate
increases with age to 70% in adults 65 years or older. The periodontal complex, consisting of alveolar bone,
cementum, gingiva, and the periodontal ligament (PDL), works to ensure proper tooth attachment and
nourishment, distribute occlusal forces, maintain alveolar bone height, and protect the periodontium from
invading microbes. Periodontal disease leads to the destruction of one or more of these tissues, which
ultimately results in partial or total edentulism as well as reduced function of the masticatory complex, self-
esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Most therapies are unpredictable as well as unsuccessful at repairing
all three lost or damaged tissues. Bone sialoprotein (Ibsp gene; BSP protein) is a multifunctional, extracellular
matrix protein found in mineralized tissues of the skeleton and dentition, including alveolar bone and
cementum. Total knockout mice (Ibsp-/-) display reduced acellular cementum, hypomineralized alveolar bone,
PDL detachment, severe alveolar bone resorption, tooth loss, and periodontal destruction. To date, nearly all
studies on BSP focus on its roles in cranial and postcranial development. However, its dual functions in
osteoblasts and osteoclasts also suggest an important role in the coupled process of bone remodeling; Ibsp-/-
mice show dramatic defects in alveolar bone socket healing following molar extraction. While the importance of
BSP in the periodontal complex is evident, its molecular functions remain unclear. We propose BSP is a key
molecule in periodontal development, homeostasis, and repair. The outlined experiments will test our central
hypothesis that BSP modulates periodontal development and repair through its functions in key cells for
periodontal function: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. The overall objectives of this proposal are:
1.) define the origin of BSP and cementoblast lineage using conditional ablation of Ibsp from ectomesenchymal
vs. epithelial cell populations; 2.) elucidate the role(s) of BSP in osteoblast and osteoclast function(s) in
alveolar bone healing by conditionally ablating Ibsp from osteoblasts and osteoclasts; and 3.) determine the
role of BSP in postmenopausal osteoporotic changes to bone metabolism using an ovariectomy (OVX) rodent
model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The knowledge gained from this proposal holds promise for the
development of novel and reparative therapies of the periodontal complex. Successful completion of the
proposed research will provide key insights into the function(s) of BSP in periodontal biology as well as
diseases characterized by excessive osteoblast-osteoclast decoupling."

This application represents a training plan designed to provide mentoring, career development, and support to
the applicant as a clinician-scientist seeking to move research from the benchtop to the bedside in craniofacial
and oral sciences. The training plan encompasses laboratory experimentation and professional and career
development opportunities, and the plan is supported by the outstanding local and institutional resources
available at UIC. The proposed research will address an important unmet clinical need facing craniofacial
trauma. While the mandible is the strongest and largest facial bone, there is a high level of incidence for
mandibular fractures. Unstable mandibular fractures exhibit delayed healing compared to fixed fractures, and
their healing involves a chondrocyte-to-osteoblast developmental pathway that is not yet fully understood.
Understanding the specific molecular pathways that control fracture resolution is important for improving
clinical outcomes and the development of new therapeutics. The focus of this study is on a transmembrane
proteoglycan, NG2/CSPG4. This molecule has been implicated in the mechanical response of mandibular
chondrocytes in the temporomandibular joint and the progression of osteoarthritis, but it has not been studied
in the context of endochondral fracture healing. The research plan in this proposal utilizes a preclinical murine
model of endochondral fracture healing in the mandible, together with transgenic knockout animal models, to
define the role of NG2/CSPG4 in the cell differentiation cascade that is required for the successful
mineralization of a fracture callus. The proposed research plan will test the central hypothesis that mechanical
loading-dependent NG2/CSPG4 signaling regulates the differentiation of osteochondral progenitor cells during
endochondral ossification in mandibular fractures. Long-term, our goal is to understand how cells make
decisions about their fate during bone regeneration. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of NG2/CSPG4 in the ability of
osteochondral progenitor cells to differentiate into cartilage. Aim 2 will focus on the role of NG2/CSPG4 in the
ability of cartilage cells to undergo mineralization. Together, the data generated from this project will address
an important gap in knowledge surrounding mandibular fracture healing and bone biology more broadly and
may identify a new therapeutic target for clinical intervention."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) poses a global healthcare burden, with significant morbidity and
mortality associated with excessive alcohol consumption and effective therapeutic options still lacking. Human
genome-wide association studies have recently identified genes potentially modulating alcohol consumption,
but pinpointing their mechanisms of action remains difficult. Genetic variance influencing gene expression has
been suggested as an additional factor in AUD but remains difficult to study in humans due to confounding
environmental factors, difficulty with tissue collection and inability to conduct mechanistic manipulations.
Mouse models are an effective substitute; Diversity Outbred (DO) mice from Jackson Labs display a large
amount of genetic diversity and small recombination intervals, allowing for precision mapping of quantitative
trait loci (QTLs). Recent research in our lab using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice identified marked variability in
ethanol consumption, with a pattern of progressive ethanol intake across the DO mice and heritability ranging
from 48-62%. Multiple highly significant or suggestive behavioral quantitative trait loci (bQTL) were identified
for alcohol consumption phenotypes, along with unique positional candidate genes; however, determination of
causal candidates and definition of mechanisms by which specific genes influence ethanol consumption have
not been yet been accomplished. We hypothesize that genetic mechanisms of DO mouse ethanol consumption
variance are largely driven by cognate differences in gene expression networks across PFC and NAc and that
a combined behavioral and expression genetics approach can identify critical molecular mechanisms and
candidate genes modulating ethanol consumption. To test this hypothesis, we aim to 1) employ an algorithm to
rank candidate genes influencing ethanol consumption using RNA-seq data collected from PFC and NAc
samples from DO mice, and functionally characterize gene expression networks associated with ethanol
consumption; 2) derive mechanistic causal inferences about individual gene expression patterns and their
relationships with ethanol consumption, and estimate direct genetic and individual gene transcript mediation
effects using structural equation modeling; and 3) validate causal candidates using viral vector mouse genetic
modulation of a candidate gene for ethanol consumption. These studies will provide the applicant with robust
and unique training in quantitative genetics, genomic and transcriptomic analyses, and the neurobiology of
alcohol, preparing him for a successful career as future independent investigator in the behavioral genetics of
alcohol."

Cell proliferation under normal and adverse environmental conditions depends on multiple DNA damage
response (DDR) pathways. Replicative stress and cellular exposure to genotoxic agents can lead to double-
strand breaks (DSBs) which are the most lethal DNA lesions. Major DSB repair (DSBR) pathways include error-
prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and accurate homology-directed repair (HDR) which promotes
genome integrity and tumor suppression. Microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), also referred to as
alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) and polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ), is the most recently
discovered DSBR pathway that contributes to genome instability and cancer cell survival. Over the last 15-20
years, basic research of DSBR has arguably led to some of the most important advances in the history of
biomedical science and biotechnology, such as the development of Poly ADP ribose 1 (PARP1) inhibitors as
precision medicine for HDR-deficient cancers, and genome engineering involving CRISPR-Cas9 which was the
subject of the 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry.
 Dr. Pomerantz’s lab has strongly contributed to advancing our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
of MMEJ based DSBR over the past 10 years, and has significantly contributed to advancing our understanding
of RNA-templated DSBR (RNA-DNA repair) over the past 5 years. For example, Dr. Pomerantz’s lab recently
identified a new MMEJ repair pathway involving Poll, and discovered that human Polq exhibits reverse
transcriptase activity and promotes RNA-DNA repair in human cells. To significantly advance our basic
knowledge of some of the most intriguing and important areas of DSBR, the Pomerantz lab proposes to continue
to address the following three questions: 1. Does RNA directly contribute to DSBR? 2. How are DSBR
proteins structurally and chemically regulated? 3. Do undiscovered DSBR pathways exist and contribute
to genome instability/integrity?"

The lab recently discovered a family of proton-selective ion channels collectively known as the
Otopetrins. The protein family was first identified based on the essential role of OTOP1 in the
development of the vestibular system, but their function as proton channels was not known.
Functions ascribed to OTOP channels since their discovery include pH sensing in the taste
system of both vertebrates and invertebrates and biomineralization in the development of the
invertebrate skeleton and vertebrate otoconia. OTOP channels have been found in the digestive
tract where they may play a role in pH sensing or acid transport, and where their expression is
correlated with disease prognosis. This application is to fund multidisciplinary approaches in the
Liman lab aimed at uncovering the basic functional properties of OTOP channels and describing
their distribution in vertebrate and invertebrate systems, with the ultimate goal of understanding
the role of OTOP channels in non-sensory systems. The proposal focuses mainly on vertebrate
OTOP2 and OTOP3 and on invertebrate OTOPS, whose function and distribution are poorly
understood. In the last grant period, the lab showed that OTOP3 is gated by H+ and Zn2+ while
OTOP2 is constitutively open. Using chimeras between the channels, we were able to begin to
identify elements of the gating apparatus. In the next grant period, the lab will examine, in
increasing detail, the functional properties of OTOP2 and OTOP3 channels that are relevant to
their physiological roles. The structural basis for functional properties of OTOP2 and OTOP3
channels, such as the mechanism of Zn2+ potentiation, will be determined using structure-guided
site-directed mutagenesis. Moreover, we will develop and test mouse strains that allow us to
visualize the distribution of OTOP channels and test their functional roles. A goal of the research
is to discover basic principles that govern the function of this novel class of ion channels and to
identify commonalities that will lead to an understanding of their functions in different cellular
contexts. Because OTOP2 and OTOP3 channels are not yet associated closely with a
physiological process or disease, funding from NIGMS is critical to support these fundamental
studies."

 Perhaps one of the most intriguing, yet least studied, aspects of macromolecular
transport is traffic through intercellular connections. These connections are termed tunneling
nanotubes in mammals and plasmodesmata (Pd) in plants. Whereas both mammalian and plant
viruses utilize cell-to-cell transport pathways, the first such capability was identified for
movement proteins (MPs) of plant viruses, the transport of which via Pd represents a
conceptual paradigm for intercellular traffic of macromolecules. Whereas the main research
effort in the field, including our lab, has been focused on the mechanism of MP cell-to-cell
movement, the important question of how the movement mechanism is controlled remained
largely unaddressed. The proposed research program aims to begin filing this gap in our
knowledge. Research in my laboratory focuses on three diverse aspects of plant biology and
plant-pathogen interactions: (i) cell-to-cell transport of the movement protein (MP) of the model
plant virus TMV; (ii) bacterium-to-plant cell transport of proteins and nucleic acids during genetic
transformation by Agrobacterium; and (iii) epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including
the pathogen response genes, by histone modifications. Recently, all three projects converged
on the regulatory roles of ubiquitin writers (E3 ligases) and erasers (deubiquitinases) in the plant
life cycle in general, and in the MP cell-to-cell transport in particular. Specifically, our findings
suggest that ubiquitin writers and erasers dynamically control two major aspects of the MP cell-
to-cell transport process: cargo stability/availability and assembly/disassembly of the Pd
transport machinery. The proposed program leverages the wealth of molecular tools and
experimental approaches that we have developed along the years to study cell-to-cell transport
of plant viruses and roles of protein ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation in plant-pathogen interactions
to address a new (and, so far, completely unresearched) level of regulation of intercellular
transport through Pd by reversible action of ubiquitin writers and erasers of the plant cell. We
believe that this goal is innovative and likely to be transformative also for studies of transport of
other proteins, viral and plant, through Pd."

Uterine-factor infertility affects up to 8.0% of infertile women, 13.3% of those with a history of miscarriage, 24.5%
of those with miscarriage and infertility and 1:500 or 1.5 million women worldwide. The use of human allogeneic
uterine tissues is a good option for uterine reconstruction, but its clinical use can be compromised by donor
shortage, and immunologic complications. Alternatives are needed. Recently, we reported, in Nature
Biotechnology, the application of autologous cell seeded-bioengineered uterine constructs for subtotal organ
replacement in a rabbit model. The engineered constructs maintained luminal patency, developed native uterine
tissue-like cellular and acellular structure and biomechanical properties; and supported embryo attachment,
placentation, pregnancy, and full-term delivery of viable offspring following natural mating. While rabbits provide
proof-of principle for this approach, they do not have a simplex uterus or monthly menstrual cyclicity. The most
appropriate preclinical model that parallels the uterine structure and function of women are old-world monkeys
who have a relatively thick simplex uterus, a monthly menstrual cycle including cycles of growth, differentiation,
degeneration (menses), and regeneration during their reproductive life. Recently, we completed a series of tests
using bioengineered implants that accommodate the thicker simplex uterus of NHPs and assessed structural
maturation; but did not assess the contribution of seeded vs. peripheral cells and matrix production in structural
regeneration, or their relationship to native uterine/endometrial biology and function. To this end, the goal of this
study is to measure the ability of autologous cell-seeded polymer scaffolds to reproduce primate-like uterine
tissue-like structure and function with significant surgically created uterine defects. The approach is to identify
the cellular and acellular origin of structural and functional regeneration; thus exploring the biology of the
regeneration process in these bioengineered implants. The clinical potential for successful treatment of uterine
factor infertility includes repair of adenomyosis/adenomyomas and uterine fibroid resection; restoration of
endometrial function in Asherman’s Syndrome; and reconstruction of normal uterine anatomy and function in
women with congenital abnormalities. Aim 1 will assess the structural development of the seeded bioengineered
implants and test the hypotheses that these implants develop native uterine tissue-like structure and size; consist
of both labeled seeded myometrial/endometrial and peripheral cells that contribute cellular and acellular
development similar to native tissue. Aim 2 will assess the functional development of bioengineered uterine
constructs and will test the hypotheses that they develop biomechanical and contractile properties similar to that
of native uteri; and functional endometrial markers consistent with normal uterine receptivity, implantation and
pregnancy. These studies will translate the work done in rabbits to a primate model that is highly relevant in
structure and physiology to that of women, and help us better understand the underlying biology of a
bioengineering approach for treating uterine factor infertility."
10767353,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Reward-associated cues are unlikely to provoke reward seeking when that behavior is inappropriate, yet cues
elicit opioid seeking in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) when that behavior is unproductive or
maladaptive. There is little understanding of how brain systems that can normally suppress unproductive reward
seeking are modified by opioid use and causally contribute to opioid seeking. This is in part due to technical
feasibility, as measuring adaptations in single neurons across the onset, maintenance, and relapse phases of
opioid use is challenging. Here, I overcome this issue using a novel assay developed in my lab, wherein I
longitudinally track activity in precisely defined neurons throughout heroin self-administration, extinction, and
reinstatement using two-photon calcium imaging in head-restrained mice. We test the overarching hypothesis
that a thalamostriatal subcircuit is inhibited by opioid use and by the presentation of stimuli that initiate opioid-
seeking behaviors. In support of this hypothesis, my preliminary data suggest that posterior paraventricular
thalamic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (pPVT NAc) become hypoactive and hypoexcitable
as a result of repeated heroin use and display rapid reductions in activity during cue- and drug-induced
reinstatement of heroin seeking. Furthermore, I show that optogenetically mimicking this inhibition during
extinction initiates heroin seeking. To test my specific hypotheses, in Aim 1, I will longitudinally track the activity
dynamics of single pPVT NAc neurons and neuronal ensembles throughout heroin self-administration,
extinction, and reinstatement. In Aim 2, I will evaluate the long-lasting intrinsic and synaptic adaptations among
pPVT NAc neurons at multiple timepoints following heroin self-administration. In Aim 3, I will determine the
function of pPVT NAc neuronal activity for the suppression of heroin seeking during extinction, and expression
of heroin seeking during reinstatement. Overall, this project will identify how a brain circuit that inhibits reward
seeking in inappropriate conditions is modified by opioid use and causally influences opioid-seeking behavior."
10783037,"Targeting inhibitor-resistant breast tumors with HER3-homing nano-capsids
 Elevated cell surface levels of the human epidermal growth factor receptor subunit 3 (HER3) is associated
with resistance to a number of signal-blocking breast cancer treatments, including inhibitors of EGF-R (lapatinib),
HER2 (lapatinib, trastuzumab, T-DM1), HER2-3 (pertuzumab), and combination therapy. Additionally, HER3
elevation has been identified on “untarget-able” tumors such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Patients
with such refractory tumors currently have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Moreover, as up to
70% of cases resist or acquire resistance to signal-blocking therapies, an alternative approach addressing this
important clinical problem has the potential for significant clinical impact. We have developed a self-assembling
nanobiological particle, HerDox, which uses HER3 as a portal for targeted entry of toxic molecules. In contrast
to receptor-targeted antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently used in the clinic, HerDox circumvents
the need to modulate signaling and can induce rapid entry of toxic molecules into tumor cells by receptor-
mediated endocytosis and membrane penetration. We have previously shown that HerDox can elicit targeted
toxicity to trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ tumors due to the augmented levels of HER3 on these cells in
association with resistance, while sparing heart and liver tissue. Whereas the prevalence of HER2-3
heterodimers on the HER2+ tumor cell surface can enable targeting by HerDox, naïve HER2+ tumors exposed
to trastuzumab undergo acute shift to a HER3+ phenotype and acquire augmented sensitization to HerDox
targeting and potency. EGFR inhibitors also have the same effect on both HER2+ and triple-negative breast
tumors in experimental models. These findings suggest that neoadjuvant treatment of primary tumors with clinical
inhibitors of HER2 or EGF-R can impart selective pressure on a heterogeneous tumor, driving expression of
surviving cells to a HER3 augmented phenotype and thus cornering these resistant tumors for HerDox attack.
This study will test this phenomenon in preclinical models of HER2+ and triple-negative tumors undergoing
treatment with targeted therapies currently used in the clinic or in clinical trials that are aimed at HER2 and EGF-
R, respectively. Our recent studies also show that HER3 is expressed on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and can
facilitate passage of systemic HerDox across the BBB and into brain-localized HER3+ TNBC tumors. The brain
is a predominant site of metastasis for both TNBC and resistant HER2+ breast tumors, but most targeted
therapies that are effective extracranially lack significant impact on intracranial tumors and thus brain metastases
remain a significant clinical problem. Both HER2+ and TNBC tumors that escape intervention and metastasize
to the brain express high levels of HER3. Therefore, we will also evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HerDox on
HER2+ and TNBC tumors localized in the brain as models of post brain-metastatic resistant breast cancer, for
which there is currently no targeted treatment or effective intervention."

Electronic cigarettes (e-cig) have been promoted as electronic nicotine (NIC) delivery systems (ENDS) without
the adverse effects of tobacco cigarette smoking (CS). However, recent studies have reported a wide range of
e-cig-induced toxicities with severe inflammatory lung disease observed in e-cig users. While there is a strong
association between CS-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and cancer, this has not been established for
e-cig use. E-cig generate toxic species, including free radicals and reactive acetaldehydes with the levels of
these toxicants increased with increasing device power. These toxic chemicals produce reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which can lead to uncontrolled inflammation and DNA damage with dysregulated cell
proliferation that trigger carcinogenesis. In our chronic mouse e-cig exposure model, we observed that e-cig
aerosol, generated from e-cig liquid containing NIC, induced lung tumors in 50% of the mice studied at 50
weeks of exposure, as first detected by micro-CT imaging. Histopathological examination of the tumors
showed adenocarcinoma or adenoma with focal mixed broncho-alveolar neoplastic and pre-malignant cells.
Superoxide radicals, inflammation, DNA damage and stemness markers were detected in the alveoli and
bronchioles, preceding cancer development at earlier exposure times. The free radicals and high levels of
aldehydes in e-cig aerosol, as well as the NIC derived iminium metabolite, can trigger processes of cellular
ROS generation and this may serve as a central trigger of carcinogenesis. Based on the critical public health
implications of this work, it is imperative to expand these observations to measure the exposure
intensity/duration relationships, and the role of e-cig aerosol free radical levels and NIC in cancer development.
Thus, we will perform longitudinal studies with the requisite group size needed to definitively address the
critical questions: 1) What is the exposure intensity and duration required for lung cancer initiation/progression?
2) What is the incidence rate of e-cig-induced lung cancer? 3) Is cancer onset and/or progression NIC-
dependent? 4) How is it effected by device power and resultant aerosol free radical levels? 5) Is cancer onset
and/or progression gender-dependent? 6) What are the mechanisms by which e-cig exposure triggers ROS
generation and inflammation in the lung? Studies with longitudinal micro-CT, MRI, EPR spectroscopy, EPR-
MRI co-imaging and blood tumor markers followed by biochemical assays and histopathology will determine
the role of exposure duration, ENDS power, NIC, and gender on initiation and/or progression of lung cancer.
ROS generation, lung inflammation and secondary epithelial mesenchymal transition will be evaluated as
triggers or steps leading to carcinogenesis. With knowledge of the role of these mechanisms and evaluation of
inhibitors that block them, we will identify therapeutic interventions that could be used to ameliorate e-cig
induced lung inflammation and carcinogenesis. Thus, this research will provide important insights defining the
carcinogenesis risk of e-cig use, and its underlying exposure-dependent triggers and mechanisms."

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurogenetic cancer predisposition syndrome, affecting 1 in
3,000 individuals worldwide. While most of the tumors are benign neoplasms (neurofibromas, low-grade
gliomas), 10-13% of patients will develop an aggressive sarcoma, termed a malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor (MPNST). Composed of high-grade neoplastic Schwann cells, MPNST most often arise from a benign
precursor lesion, such as plexiform neurofibroma (PN). Unfortunately, even with aggressive multi-modality
therapy, these cancers recur in >50% of individuals, and most patients die within five years of diagnosis. For
this reason, there is an unmet need for better therapeutic modalities. To identify novel targets, we generated a
series of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) lines that more accurately reflect the molecular heterogeneity of
human MPNSTs. Using these PDX lines, we showed that MPNST exhibit a high degree of aneuploidy and
harbor gains involving the long arm of chromosome 8 (Chr8q). Detailed analysis of Chr8q genes revealed that
UBR5 is the most highly upregulated gene in MPNST and that UBR5 genetic knockdown (KD) decreased
MPNST proliferation, survival, and migration. Based on these exciting data, we hypothesize that UBR5 is a
key driver of MPNST pathogenesis and in part responsible for Chr8 gain-mediated MPNST malignant
progression. In this proposal, we will: (1) Define when in MPNST progression Chr8q gain occurs and if UBR5
expression through this molecular event correlates with worse overall survival. (2) Utilize a recently developed
human induced pluripotent stem cell plexiform model and a murine Nf1 mutant plexiform neurofibroma-prone
strain that develops MPNST following lentiviral manipulation of other genomic drivers to determine the
sufficiency of UBR5 to promote MPNST formation. (3) Determine the mechanism of action of UBR5 in MPNST
including how UBR5 regulates cell survival and whether its role is dependent on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
The experiments outlined in this proposal will provide a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of
MPNST, which is required to uncover new opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies
that may improve clinical outcomes."

By the year 2050 the WHO predicts there will be 2 billion people aged 60 years and over. As the population of
aged individuals rises so will aging-associated diseases. To create better prevention strategies for diseases in
the elderly, we need to address fundamental biological questions regarding immune system deterioration
during the aging process. Specifically, the goal of this proposal is to determine whether defects in natural
immunity in the aged are due to changes in self-renewal of a subset of B cells, B1 cells, which produce natural
antibodies (NAbs).
NAbs are generated in the absence B1 cell stimulation and constitute a key modality of serological immunity
providing many essential functions within in immune system. The effectiveness of NAbs is attributed to their
distinct germline-like properties that result from development of B1 cells during fetal life with persistence into
adulthood. Our studies demonstrate NAbs are less effective at providing protection in aged males yet,
protection is maintained in aged females. If effective NAbs are maintained over a lifetime, these essential
proteins could aid in producing an increase in both health-span and lifespan; yet it is unknown how protective
NAbs are maintained in aged females but not aged males.
This loss in NAb protection against infection in aged males is not accounted for by a change in the amount of
antigen specific antibody, but instead, is due to the loss of antibody germline-like features, which does not
occur in aged females, where B1 cell derived antibody remains germline-like. Our preliminary and published
results suggest these findings are a result of better persistence of B1 cells that originate in fetal life with
advancing age in females as opposed to males. The reason for this is unknown but it is speculated that B1 cell
self-renewal is responsible. We hypothesize age and sex-associated defects in the protective capacity of
natural IgM results from loss of adult B1 cell self-renewal in aged males but not aged females. To test this
hypothesis, we will utilize advanced genetic techniques that provide the means for the first time to separately
track B1 cells originating in fetal life from those arising in adult life, and for the first time to measure the stage at
which B1 cells are in cell cycle, according to sex and age. We will 1) determine how biological sex influences
long term persistence of mouse B1 cells generated during different phases of life; 2) examine sex specific
regulation of mouse B1 cell cycle progression and self-renewal with increasing age; and 3) evaluate the role of
sex in specifying human B1 cell cycle dynamics and human B1 cell natural antibody function. This project will
elucidate mechanisms of differential B1 cell self-renewal in aged males and females, which will provide critical
information for designing novel approaches to maintain healthy natural immunity into old age by favoring self -
renewal of early appearing B1 cells."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long been associated with compositional and metabolic changes in the
gut microbiota, yet extensive research efforts have failed to identify a single pathogenic microorganism as the
causative agent. In this grant, we investigate an alternative hypothesis in which gut inflammation drives
adaptations in commensal bacteria that further exacerbates disease in IBD. Though bacterial adaptations are
necessary for commensal survival and persistence in the inflamed gut, we currently do not understand how these
adaptive strategies alter the function of commensal microbes. These include metabolic and immunomodulatory
activities of commensal bacteria that regulate mucosal immune homeostasis in health and disease. Thus, there
is a critical need to understand how the inflamed gut environment shapes commensal bacteria metabolism to
further exacerbate inflammation in IBD. The long-term goal of this study is to understand how gut bacteria direct
immune responses in order to develop rational microbial therapies for inflammatory diseases. Our central
hypothesis is that the oxygenated environment of the inflamed gut drives metabolic adaptations in commensal
bacteria, resulting in expansion of bacterial strains that exacerbate intestinal inflammation. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) define the genetic and functional variation of
commensal Bacteroides fragilis in the IBD gut; 2) determine the metabolic adaptations of commensal bacteria
during experimental colitis; and 3) identify the impact of oxygen on anaerobic bacterial metabolism and immune
modulation. We will examine the genetic variation of B. fragilis strains from healthy and IBD cohorts. This
information will enable the construction of strain-specific B. fragilis genome-scale models to elucidate the
metabolic output and phenotypic states of IBD-associated strains. Next, we will determine the genetic
adaptations of B. fragilis in mouse models of colitis and test the impact of intestinal inflammation on bacterial
metabolism and immune modulation. Finally, we will examine how oxygen-adapted strains of B. fragilis may
have metabolic and immunological consequences on intestinal homeostasis. The proposed research is
significant because defining commensal bacteria adaptations to early stages of gut inflammation will be a
powerful strategy for detecting and treating early stages of IBD and preventing progression into the debilitating
chronic phase of IBD."

Viral infection is a major contributor to the global burden of infectious diseases. Virus-related glomerular diseases
are seen in increasing frequency in clinical practice but are still underrecognized, thus miss opportunities for
timely treatment. Viral exposure can alter host immunity in subtle ways, leaving an indelible footprint on the
immune system. While there have been many studies indicating the association of viral infection with glomerular
disease, a direct involvement of virus in kidney barrier dysfunction is unknown in most cases. Among remarkable
research obstacles, lacking of a convenient and relevant animal model can be the most alarming one. We have
recently established a novel mouse model whereby viral proteins drive glomerular disease in concert with a
unique immune molecule, soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR). Intranasal injection of SARS-Cov-2 spike S1
protein (2019-nCov) caused proteinuria and podocyte injury specifically in mice with high levels of suPAR.
Treatment with anti-suPAR antibody in mice or anti- v 3 integrin antibody on human podocytes blocked
proteinuria and protected the glomerular filtration apparatus respectively. Notably, we found this unique synergy
between viral protein and host suPAR in causing glomerular disease applies to other integrin binding viruses as
well, including HIV-1 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Clinically, suPAR is associated with kidney function loss in
patients with HIV-1 infection, and in those with moderate to severe Covid-19. Based on these intriguing new
insights, we hypothesize that viral-host suPAR interplay induces glomerular integrin activation and plays an
essential role in some virus-associated glomerular disease. We propose to test this hypothesis by
comprehensively evaluating the implication of viral protein-suPAR-integrin triad in both mouse models (Aim 1)
and virus-associated human glomerular diseases (Aim 2), utilizing state of the art tools, and unique combinations
of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Additionally, we will test therapeutic modalities targeting the vicious viral
protein-suPAR-integrin cycle with relevant small molecule inhibitors and antibodies (Aim 3)."

 We recently identified a number of novel secreted soluble decoy RTK isoforms (sdRTKs), generated by an alternative
splicing/intronic polyadenylation (IPA) mechanism, which can act as potent natural inhibitors of aberrant RTK signaling, a
key driving aspect of a large fraction of cancers, including lung cancer. Further, we developed an antisense-based method
to effectively induce expression of the inhibitory soluble decoy RTKs in vitro and in vivo. These compounds represent a
new class of drugs that carry the advantage of simultaneously knocking down the pathological targets while introducing
natural dominant-negative isoforms, thus greatly increasing efficacy.
 We propose to apply this antisense-based splicing redirection strategy to induce endogenous, soluble decoy EGFR
inhibitory variants (sdEGFR) in EGFR-dependent tumors. sdEGFR variants, which are normally expressed at low
levels, encode the extracellular ligand-binding domain but lack the intracellular kinase domain.
We hypothesize that sdEGFR-inducing compounds inhibit EGFR signaling by a three-fold mechanism: A)
removal of full-length EGFR receptor, B) sequestration of EGF and other ligands, and C) neutralizing hetero-
dimerization with residual receptors (EGFR, HER2/3, etc.). We further posit that, as the resulting products are secreted,
they affect signaling in both targeted and bystander cells alike and interfere with paracrine and autocrine loops,
thus exerting an amplified effect. Since its mechanism of action is different from that of current therapies, this strategy
should be effective in all refractory tumors where the mechanisms of resistance still relies on EGFR activity, both
when such activity is being driven by wild-type EGFR amplification or EGFR-activating mutations.
 To this end, we will pursue the following specific aims:
 1) Characterization of natural inhibitory sdEGFR splicing variants.
 2) Optimization of splicing redirection compounds targeted to EGFR.
 3) Modulation of endogenous EGFR splicing and polyadenylation in treatment-resistant tumor models.
 We propose to use non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as our initial cancer model. NSCLC is the most frequent cause
of cancer fatalities, with over 130,000 deaths per year, a quarter of which are associated to, and depend on, aberrant
EGFR signaling. Notwithstanding the initial efficacy of targeted drugs, such as third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Osimertinib, against most activated EGFR, resistance typically emerges within 2 years. Thus, the development of
additional, alternative approaches to treat refractory EGFR-dependent cancers remains an unfulfilled need.
 Importantly, whereas we propose to use NSCLC as our main model system both in vitro and in vivo, our findings will
also directly apply to any cancer where EGFR plays an important role and is frequently mutated or amplified, such
as glioblastoma, colorectal cancer and others. Furthermore, analogous compounds can be simply designed against other
RTKs or other targets responsible for various mechanisms of drug-resistance and pathological signaling, thus adding a
powerful new set of tools to understand such phenomena, and to inform a multitude of therapeutic leads."

10747348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The retina is the most metabolically active neuronal tissue in the human body. The defect in the
energy metabolism of photoreceptor neurons and their supporting cells including glia and retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE), emerges as an important underlying cause for retinal degenerative
diseases such as inherited retinal degeneration and aging-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Previous studies and data from our lab support that photoreceptors, glial cells, and RPE are
biochemically adapted to form a metabolic ecosystem: 1) RPE transports glucose from choroid
blood supply to photoreceptors; 2) Photoreceptors metabolize most of the glucose into lactate; 3)
Lactate inhibits glycolysis in RPE to facilitate glucose transport; 4) Lactate stimulate Müller glia to
synthesize glutamine for photoreceptors. The long term goal of this project is to define the
metabolic interactions between photoreceptors and Müller glia and between RPE and outer retina
in vivo and identify their roles in retinal function and degeneration.
Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) controls the entry of pyruvate from glycolysis into
mitochondria for oxidative metabolism. We recently found that the deletion of MPC in the retina
depletes glutamine and glutamate, inhibits glutamine utilization and enhancing ketone body
oxidation, resulting in a progressive decline of visual function and retinal degeneration. Our
preliminary data showed that the deletion of MPC in photoreceptors causes much milder
phenotype than whole retina knockout, supporting the metabolic interaction that lactate is utilized
by other cells. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the roles of mitochondrial pyruvate
transport in photoreceptor, Müller cells and RPE in metabolic interactions, visual function, and
retinal survival. We plan to conditionally knockout MPC in photoreceptors, glia or RPE separately
and rigorously test our hypothesis using advanced tracer methodology, mass spectrometry, in
vivo infusion with 13C tracers, high-resolution imaging of metabolites, visual function tests, optical
coherence tomography, and transmission electron microscopy.
The outcome of this research will establish a conceptual framework for retinal metabolism that
describes how glucose is transported and utilized in different retinal cells and describes how
disruption of metabolism in one kind of retinal cells impacts the metabolism, function, and viability
of other retinal cells. This new knowledge will provide the basis for understanding the
mechanisms of retinal degenerative diseases and lay the foundation for developing new
treatments."

participants, approximately 30 undergraduate students from groups that are under-represented
in the sciences and 5 faculty advisors who have strong potential to encourage students from
these groups to pursue career paths in the biomedical sciences. The number of students from
some demographic groups who are pursuing graduate school in the sciences is far from parity
with their proportion among the US population, and the Society of Toxicology strongly supports
efforts to increase the diversity of the scientific workforce. Selected from a national pool of
applicants, these students and advisors will receive travel support and participate in a 3-day
program March 13-15, 2021, in Orlando, FL, in conjunction with the Society of Toxicology (SOT)
Annual Meeting March 14-18, and at the subsequent meetings in San Diego (2022) and
Nashville (2023). The aims of this program are to 1) increase awareness of undergraduate
students majoring in science and science advisors at undergraduate institutions about career
choices and opportunities in toxicology and 2) increase interest of undergraduate students in
graduate biomedical education and motivate students to obtain research experience especially
that pertinent to toxicology. Participants will hear specially selected presentations by high profile
toxicologists whose work exemplifies diverse research interests, engage in research poster
sessions, and meet with academic program directors and internship sponsors. Students are
grouped into mentoring teams including graduate student peer mentors and toxicologist host-
mentors who provide informal interaction and mentoring during the presentations, scientific and

Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) are groups of ambulatory practices devoted principally to the primary
care of patients and affiliated in their mission to investigate research questions related to the health of the
communities they serve. Current national initiatives are increasing clinical studies in community settings to
enhance recruitment of minority populations and other underserved groups that have historically been
underrepresented in clinical trials; this has resulted in PBRNs now being critical to the conduct of clinical trials in
the United States. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences Institutional Development Award for
Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-CTR) now requires PBRNs as a component of each IDeA-CTR,
providing opportunities to collaborate nationally. In 2022, the West Virginia IDeA-CTR PBRN convened an IDeA-
CTR PBRN Special Interest Group, designed to establish strong PBRN collaborations across IDeA-CTRs and
provide guidance on PBRN development strategies to those IDeA-CTRs establishing their PBRNs. However,
the IDeA-CTR Special Interest Group has not had the opportunity to meet face-to-face. We propose convening
an in-person meeting, the IDeA-CTR PBRN Summit, for purposes of driving PBRN research and increasing
clinical study participation of underrepresented populations, rural, and other underserved groups. The IDeA-CTR
PBRN summit will provide a forum for IDeA-CTR PIs, PBRN directors, and community members to discuss
relevant research, share best practices, and discuss solutions to common challenges experienced by primary

Diseases and disorders in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) and women’s health have a
profound impact on public health and families in the U.S. and around the globe. In addition,
many of these healthcare issues disproportionately impact poor and minoritized women and
pregnant people. For example, infant and maternal morbidity and mortality, preterm birth, low
birth weight, unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, infertility, and cervical
cancer all impact impoverished persons and persons of color to a greater extent than white and
more affluent individuals. Unfortunately, there is a lack of well-trained OBGYN clinical
investigators to address these important public health problems. The purpose of this R13
application is to provide support for 10 conferences/courses (twice per year for 5 years) to train
junior OBGYN investigators in clinical research design, biostatistics, ethical conduct of research,
and academic success (e.g., publishing, grant writing, promotions, etc.). The specific aims of
this application are to: 1) provide support for a diverse group of faculty that will create an
educational, interactive, and inspiring course in clinical research design and academic success
in OBGYN and women’s health research; 2) recruit promising and diverse junior faculty and
fellows in OBGYN who will attend the course, bring back valuable insights to their departments,
mentor fellows, OBGYN residents and medical students interested in OBGYN research, and
advance cutting edge science that will ultimately improve OBGYN and women’s health; and 3)
evaluate and improve this course through iterative approach with feedback from participants
and by tracking attendees over time to assess “success.” Success with be defined by tracking
academic metrics such as the number of peer-reviewed publications, grants submitted and
obtained, and academic advancement (e.g., promotion) and awards. We will also track our
recruitment of diverse faculty and conference attendees. The course will be innovative as it will
begin with virtual meetings to establish a baseline knowledge base and to tailor the course itself
to attendees and will follow participants over 18-24 months to assess success. It will stimulate
new ideas through facilitated brainstorming sessions, group discussions, scheduled, intentional
one-on-one interactions (mentoring sessions); The ultimate goal of this course is to train a new
and inspired group of new OBGYN investigators who will be poised to advance the health of
women and pregnant people in the U.S. and abroad."

Recent array-based epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of brain tissue report differential DNA
methylation in known and newly recognized late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) genes, thereby
underscoring the utility of EWAS in disclosing novel genes and pathways associated with LOAD pathogenesis.
As an alternative to the study of samples from donor brains, investigation of DNA methylation in accessible
peripheral tissues offers the opportunity to improve LOAD diagnosis and prognosis. Recently, we’ve identified
differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in blood that distinguish men and women with and without LOAD at
477 of 769,190 loci in a plurality of genes. Of these DMPs, 17 are shared between DMPs observed using clinical
LOAD markers analyzed independently as continuous variables comprising Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
scores, cerebrospinal fluid total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) levels, and t-tau/Aβ1–42 (Aβ42),
p-tau181/Aβ42, and Aβ42/Aβ1–40 (Aβ40) ratios. In patients with LOAD, 12 of the shared 17 DMPs are hypo-
methylated in B3GALT4 (Beta-1,3-galatcosyltransferase 4), a gene previously associated with LOAD in superior
temporal gyrus brain tissue, and 5 are hypo-methylated in ZADH2 (Prostaglandin reductase 3), a novel LOAD-
associated gene. Together these data reinforce use of blood to identify DMPs associated with dementia that
arises from LOAD, leading to the hypothesis that DNA methylation levels in blood may be used to identify novel
diagnostic, prognostic, and modifiable therapeutic targets of LOAD. Using a whole-genome-based approach,
this proposal builds upon the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center’s (WADRC) existing banked
biofluids and phenotypic data to validate the 477 DMPs, including sites in B3GALT4 and ZADH2, as biomarkers
of LOAD, while at the same time examining DNA methylation levels across the entire human genome (>25
million loci), with the potential to further identify novel DNA methylation predictors of LOAD. In addition, these
studies will be expanded by examining a second cohort of female and male participants presently enrolled in the
WADRC with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to identify DNA methylation biomarkers prior to the
onset of LOAD. MCI is an intermediate stage between cognitively normal older adults and LOAD. Patients with
MCI have an elevated risk of progressing to dementia. Eighty percent of MCI patients convert to LOAD after an
average of 6 years. Blood biomarkers that distinguish patients with MCI who later progress to LOAD from those
with MCI who do not progress to LOAD offer a substantial opportunity to improve the diagnosis and early
intervention in patients with accelerated cognitive aging. Together, findings from the present proposal will provide
the foundation for identifying DNA methylation profiles in blood that predict the expression and progression to
LOAD, detect deviations from healthy cognitive trajectories, identify modifiable risk factors and interventions, and
bolster research efforts with an epigenetic metric that integrates heritable and acquired variables that influence
aging."

alcohol consumption (Grant/Schnitko), (iii.) whole brain cFos analysis following GPR88 agonism to
reduce alcohol consumption (Kieffer/Harsan). Thus, these integrated, yet independent aims, will provide

10904860,"Project Summary/Abstract
Food insecurity has been linked to adverse health outcomes in children and adults, including obesity and
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Much less is known about health effects of food insecurity around pregnancy,
but there is substantial reason for concern, especially given that more than 1 in 10 pregnancies are affected.
Food insecurity often results in higher intake of fast and highly processed foods, leading to an unhealthful, pro-
inflammatory dietary pattern. Intake of highly processed foods also may lead to greater exposure to synthetic
endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contaminating these foods or their packaging. Pro-inflammatory diets
and EDC exposures each predict pregnancy complications, including excessive gestational weight gain
(GWG), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), depressive
symptoms, and small or large for gestational age birth (SGA and LGA). These prenatal complications presage
excess long-term CVD risk for mother and child alike.
People of color, especially non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women and their children, are at highest risk for
food insecurity as well as pregnancy complications. Racial and ethnic inequities in these risks, and in CVD
itself, are widening with time. Neighborhoods have emerged as highly relevant contexts because they possess
both physical (e.g., access to healthy food choices) and social (e.g., availability of social services) attributes
that can drive and interact with individual-level food insecurity, which translates into poorer health that
contributes to health inequities. Understanding these relationships will help inform policies that aim to reduce
excess CVD risk in both mothers and children.
Leveraging our team’s expertise in nutritional, social, and environmental epidemiologic research in the
peripartum period and early childhood, we propose to initiate a new cohort that will participate in the nationwide
Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. We will recruit 800 pregnant people
and their offspring from racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods in the Boston, MA
area and collect data from early pregnancy onwards, including enrolling repeat pregnancies with preconception
measures. We will conduct solution-oriented science within the unparalleled ECHO data platform, with the
overall goal of better understanding how food insecurity and related neighborhood and individual
characteristics contribute to pregnancy conditions that lead to later obesity and CVD risk."

Visceral adiposity is a major risk factor for the development of metabolic syndrome. A better
understanding of visceral fat expansion in the progression of obesity may provide new strategies to
treat obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. Visceral fat expansion requires the dedicated
coordination between mature adipocytes and precursor cells. Recent advances using single cell
sequencing have revealed the heterogeneity of visceral fat depots and identified two major
precursor populations in PDGFRb+ stromal cells – adipogenic progenitor cells (APCs) and fibro-
inflammatory progenitors (FIPs) – which contribute to visceral fat expansion during obesity.
However, the main regulators that determine the fate of these two populations are largely unknown.
Recently, we found that gene expression of leptin (lep) in visceral fat is much higher than it is in
subcutaneous and brown fat. In response to acute high-fat diet (HFD) exposure (1 day), we found
a rapid increase in lep gene expression in visceral fat depots, but not in subcutaneous and brown
fat depots. This increase in lep gene expression in visceral fat is paired with a rapid expansion of
APCs and FIPs, suggesting a regulatory role for leptin. In addition, during the progression to obesity,
high leptin derived from visceral adipocytes creates a unique “hyperleptinemia” micro-environment,
which promotes the expansion of FIPs and leads to adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation.
Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin from visceral fat is a significant regulatory element of the
detrimental effects of visceral adiposity and controls visceral fat expansion by regulating precursor
cells-FIPs and APCs. In this proposal, we will take advantage of novel and well-established mouse
models, paired with biochemical techniques to uncover the paracrine effects of leptin in the
regulation of visceral fat expansion, with three specific Aims: Aim 1 is to determine whether visceral-
derived leptin contributes to the detrimental effects of visceral adiposity; Aim 2 is to assess the
paracrine effects of leptin in regulating the fate of FIPs and APCs; Aim 3 is to investigate the effect
of CXCL14 in mediating visceral fat healthy expansion. Combined, these studies will provide new
insights into paracrine effects of leptin in regulating the fate of FIPs and APCs, leading to an
unhealthy visceral fat expansion and developing visceral adiposity. In addition, this study will offer
an entirely novel means to combat against visceral adiposity by targeting on leptin/CXCL14 axis."

Approximately 120,000 Americans with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) suffer a constellation of
clinical manifestations, including aberrant proliferation of neural tissues leading to malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). MPNSTs are highly aggressive sarcomas with a
high risk of recurring and spreading, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of less than 25%. Early
diagnosis and intervention offer the best outcomes. However, the lack of convenient and
specific diagnostic tools is a major barrier to optimal therapeutic intervention. Conventional
imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT scan) and 18F-fluoro-d-glucose positron
emission tomography scans (PET scan) are insufficiently specific. Further, lesion biopsies are
extremely painful and have limited value due to the heterogeneity of these tumors. Therefore,
accurate biomarkers for diagnosis and post-treatment monitoring of MPNSTs are critically
needed. The long-term goal of this proposal is to deploy cfDNA-based biomarkers in patients
with NF1 into routine clinical use to improve early detection of malignant transformation and
monitor responses to therapy. The objective of this proposal is to establish a diagnostic panel
of DNA methylation markers, cfDNA-derived tumor fraction, and aneuploidy profiles that
correlate with and complement imaging-based modalities for a clinically effective tool to
distinguish the presence of MPNSTs from plexiform neurofibromas. Our central hypothesis is
that MPNSTs arising in patients with NF1 have unique DNA methylation and somatic
chromosomal copy number profiles (aneuploidy) that can be detected in the plasma and serve
as clinical biomarkers for early diagnosis or guide therapeutic strategies. We propose 4
Specific Aims: 1) Demonstrate methylation profiles as biomarkers of MPNST in plasma
samples; 2) Establish aneuploidy and tumor fraction as biomarkers of MPNST; 3) Evaluate the
role of advanced MRI in the early detection of MPNST; 4) Determine the feasibility of cfDNA
biomarkers to predict malignant transformation and recurrent disease. Upon conclusion, we
anticipate the development and validation of cfDNA methylation markers, cfDNA-derived tumor
fraction, and aneuploidy profiles that can complement imaging-based modalities and can help
physicians in the early detection of MPNST. Our studies are significant because they will
facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of these aggressive tumors and, consequently,
expedite appropriate treatment, thereby improving patient quality of life, including survival."

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a genetic condition in which specific types of tumors form in various
locations throughout the body. Though the majority of these tumors grow slowly, the location of certain tumors
can cause significant dysfunction. One of these tumor types grows on the vestibular branch of cranial nerve
VIII, the vestibulocochlear nerve. The cells which gives rise to this tumor type is the Schwann cell, a glial cell
type. Thus, this tumor type is termed a vestibular Schwannoma (VS), a mass of Schwann cells on the
vestibular nerve. Due to the proximity of skull base cranial elements, a VS can cause dysfunction like hearing
loss, balance issues, or facial paralysis. The current treatment options are limited to invasive surgical
procedures which can create complications. Current knowledge of the mechanisms governing the development
and growth of VS is limited due to the fact that research has been restricted to mouse and simple human cell
culture systems. This proposed study will provide vertical impact by modeling NF2 in a new system, the inner
ear organoid. Inner ear organoid induction involves step-wise differentiation in a 3D culture system using
pluripotent stem cells. Inner ear organoids develop full sensory circuits of hair cells, sensory neurons, and
myelinating Schwann cells in vitro. We will create this model by introducing a genetic manipulation in our stem
cells which mimics the genetics of NF2 patients. In Aim 1, we will analyze biochemical pathways known to be
affected in NF2 patients in this new NF2 inner ear organoid. In Aim 2, we will evaluate druggable targets in
order to assess therapeutic effectiveness to counteract the introduced NF2 mutation. This study will provide
insight into the tumorigenic processes of VS."
10783166,"SUMMARY – Engineering exosomes for new gRNA/Cas therapeutics to eliminate HBV infection
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common public health problem in the United States and worldwide.
The current antiviral treatments, using various nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), can block the HBV life cycle but cannot
eliminate integrated HBV DNA and have little effect on HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which sustains
viral replication. Thus, novel curative strategies are urgently needed to eliminate HBV cccDNA from reservoir cells.
CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene-editing is an appealing approach to tackle this problem. However, major hurdles in the
application of this technology lie in selecting the most potent guide RNAs (gRNAs) to form a specific therapeutic
regimen and delivering CRISPR/Cas therapeutics to the target cell, to elicit on-target gene-editing without causing
off-target effects. Compared to Cas9 which often requires 2 or 3 gRNAs to avoid viral escape/resistance, Cas12 is
a programmable and more potent DNA endonuclease and only requires a single gRNA for targeted gene-editing.
Unlike Cas9 and Cas12 which primarily edit DNA, Cas13 edits RNA and can be used together with Cas9 and Cas12,
for both DNA and RNA targeting. Additionally, the current CRISPR/Cas expression and delivery systems often
require viral vectors, which pose safety concerns for therapeutic applications in humans. Synthetic
ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are a novel non-viral formula with excellent features, including rapid DNA cleavage
activity, low off-target effects, low risk of insertional mutagenesis, easy production, and readiness for clinical use.
We have designed and tested a series of gRNA/Cas9 gene-editing drugs targeting HBV cccDNA and selected the
most specific and potent gRNA/Cas9 candidates to abolish HBV replication in HBV cellular models. We have also
developed a novel exosome-based delivery platform engineered to specifically deliver these HBV gene-editing drugs
to human hepatocytes. These engineered exosomes are designed to carry an HBsAg pre-S1-derived peptide (binds
to HBV receptor) on the surface of exosomes so that they can specifically deliver our gRNA/Cas therapeutics to
HBV reservoir cells. In this proposal, we will compare the capacity and specificity of gRNA/Cas12 and gRNA/Cas13
(with gRNA/Cas9 as a positive control) to eliminate HBV infection in HBV cellular models to select the most potent
gRNA/Cas regimen in vitro (R21 phase). Then, we will evaluate the capability of our engineered exosomes to deliver
our HBV gene-editing gRNA/Cas therapeutic (herein called Exo-HBV-Eliminator) for eliminating HBV infection using
an HBV-infected, liver-humanized animal model (R33 phase). We hypothesize that our Exo-HBV-gRNA/Cas
therapeutics will specifically and efficiently eliminate HBV infection and elicit minimal cytotoxic effects both in vitro
and in vivo. We propose two specific aims to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will select the most specific and potent
gRNA/Cas9/12/13 candidates and test a combination regimen in vitro. Aim 2 will evaluate the antiviral efficacy and
off-target effects of the Exo-HBV-Eliminator in HBV-infected, liver-humanized mice in vivo. The objective of this study
is to develop a novel gene therapy capable of targeting HBV cccDNA, which is incurable by the current NA treatment,
and thus this research will lay the foundation for achieving our long-term goal of curing chronic HBV infection."
10933456,"Project Summary/Abstract. Synthetic biology transformed our ability to rationally reprogram cells and use
such engineered living organisms, instead of small molecule drugs or biologics, as novel therapeutics.
However, living therapeutics proliferate and release their engineered genetic information into natural biomes
through horizontal gene transfer. Consequently, the widespread use of engineered living therapeutics
necessitates the development of efficient biocontainment technologies that not only prevent the unwanted
proliferation of cells but also eliminate the release of genetic information (transgenes) from such genetically
modified organisms (GMOs).
 The overarching goal of my proposal is to solve these challenges and develop the first microbial host
for programmable drug delivery that simultaneously provides tight biocontainment, prevents transgene release
─ horizontal gene transfer ─ into wild organisms, and offers increased stability for long-term drug production.
The PI recently demonstrated that engineering the genetic code of living cells provides a tight, potentially
unbreakable genetic firewall that eliminates horizontal gene transfer and links the survival of cells to the
presence of small molecules not available without human supplementation. However, these early experiments
also revealed significant barriers in front of the clinical translation of this technology. This project will overcome
these barriers and generate a bacterial host for controlled drug production that prevents transgene release and
viral predation while offering strict biocontainment without escape from human therapeutic doses. This goal will
be achieved through 3 specific aims: 1) The construction of a broadly virus-resistant microbial host that
prevents transgene release by generating and characterizing multiple artificial genetic codes. 2) The creation
of a tightly biocontained microbial host that utilizes a safe, food-supplement-based genetic biocontainment
system. Finally, in Aim 3, the PI will combine these developments into a microbial living therapeutic host and
demonstrate in a proof-of-concept experiment that this host enables stable, long-term therapeutic enzyme
production inside the GI tract.
 In summary, this work will create a technology and microbial host capable of addressing a wide range
of unmet needs in therapeutics development and de-risk the use of microbial GMOs for clinical translation, with
potentially broad impact on diseases ranging from autoimmune and metabolic disorders to cancer. The
proposed research and career development plan will be conducted in the lab of Dr. George M. Church at
Harvard Medical School, and the PI, Dr. Akos Nyerges, will receive extensive training in proteomics, the use of
animal models, and host-virus interaction analyses during the K99 phase from an expert advisory team. The
career development plan and the outstanding scientific environment of Harvard will enable the PI to achieve
the scientific goals of this proposal, reach scientific independence, and launch his independent research group."
10758612,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human aging is associated with an exponential increase in the occurrence of clonal hematopoiesis of
indeterminate potential (CHIP), which is associated with an increased risk of hematologic neoplasms such as
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Somatic mutations in the tumor
suppressor gene TP53 rank in the top five among genes mutated in CHIP. TP53 mutations are found in 10 to
15% of MDS patients and are associated with poor prognosis. We found that TP53 mutations identified in
CHIP and MDS promote HSPC expansion and drive MDS pathogenesis during aging. However, the underlying
mechanisms are largely unknown. Dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing has been implicated in human aging and
MDS. Mutations in splicing factors are frequently found in CHIP and MDS. We found that mutant p53 alters
pre-mRNA splicing in key regulators of inflammatory response during aging. Further, we found that mutant p53
cooperates with splicing factor mutations in pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. We hypothesize that
mutant p53 drives the pathogenesis of MDS through altering pre-mRNA splicing in hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) during aging. In this proposed research, we will utilize biochemical, genetic,
molecular, and pharmacological approaches as well as vertebrate models to investigate the mechanisms by
which mutant p53 drives MDS pathogenesis. We will determine the sensitivity of human MDS cells with TP53
mutations to spliceosome inhibitor treatment. Delineating the impact of dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing on
aged HSPCs will fill a significant knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms by which TP53 mutations promote
CHIP progression and drive MDS pathogenesis. The proposed research is highly significant because we will
interrogate the role of the spliceosome as a novel potential target for treating MDS patients with TP53
mutations."
10929448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Localized pancreatic cancers (PC) are rising in incidence and this trend is expected to continue due to increased use of
imaging modalities and focused programs on early cancer detection. Although potentially curable, long terms outcomes for
localized PC remain poor. This is due to early micrometastatic spread and risk of systemic recurrence which has been
reduced with use of systemic chemotherapy. In addition, use of chemotherapy prior to surgery lowers rates of positive
margins and these collective observations have led to the adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), i.e. prior to surgical
resection, for majority of patients. NAC extends for multiple months (4-6 months) making real time assessment of response
critical. However, this remains a big clinical challenge as pancreatic tumors don’t change much in size with NAC and use
of tumor markers is marred by lack of specificity. Pathologic response to NAC on surgical resection specimens is highly
prognostic, yet its molecular predictors remain poorly understood. Transcriptional subtypes of PC include classical and
basal subtypes; the latter resembles triple negative breast cancer, displays chemotherapy resistance, and is enriched in
metastatic disease. Single cell analysis of pancreatic tumors reveals extensive heterogeneity between classical and basal
subtypes as well cells with co-expression of both features. In Aim 1, we use our institutional cohort of 174 patients who
underwent pancreatic tumor resection after receiving NAC to identify predictors of pathologic treatment response using pre-
treatment tumor specimens. We will investigate the classico-basal cell state heterogeneity using a validated multiplex
immunofluorescence panel on initial diagnostic biopsies to understand differences in cell state between tumors which exhibit
major response vs. no pathologic response. To identify novel predictive transcriptional states beyond classical-basal
subtyping we will perform digital spatial profiling using the Nanostring GeoMx platform. In Aim 2, we propose
investigating the utility of highly sensitive ctDNA assays to track changes in tumor burden and cell state during NAC. We
expect differential ctDNA dynamics during NAC to predict outcomes. In addition using novel ctDNA based epigenetic
assays we will assess whether tumoral cell state evolves during emergence of therapeutic resistance to more basal type. This
work will lead to identification of novel predictive biomarkers which can help physicians identify high risk cases which are
unlikely to respond to traditional NAC or identify early treatment resistance in real time and facilitate earlier switch to
alternative chemotherapy or consideration of clinical trials leading to an improvement in outcomes for patients with
localized PC. The proposed research will be performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, under the guidance of Drs. Brian
Wolpin and Andrew Aguirre. Both are recognized international leaders in PC biology. Importantly, this research strategy is
one part of a comprehensive training program to support my transition to an independent research career in translational
cancer biology. My scientific advisors (Drs. Myles Brown, Ryan Corcoran, and Eliezer Van Allen) are distinguished experts
with experience highly relevant to the proposed research. My long-term goal is to lead an independent academic research
group, focused on deciphering the novel biomarkers and mechanisms underlying therapy resistance in PC. The K08 award
will provide pivotal protected time for continued mentored research and enable a successful transition to independence."
10784274,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Social avoidance behavior (SAB) plays a critical role in the development, maintenance, and chronicity of
internalizing disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).
Although current treatments reduce internalizing symptoms, these treatments fail to reduce SAB, which
contributes to symptom re-occurrence. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches that effectively
reduce SAB in patients with internalizing disorders. Preliminary data suggest that SAB is associated with
dysregulated approach-avoidance (AA) motivational responses to co-occurring social reward and social threat
(i.e., social reward-threat conflict). Dysregulated AA motivational responses are associated with disrupted
task-related connectivity between the pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC) as well as weakened intrinsic connectivity between the larger Salience Network (SN) and Default Mode
Network (DMN) systems. Thus, the immediate goal of this proposal is use transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) to causally modulate patient-specific pgACC-dlPFC dysfunction during AA motivational responses and
intrinsic SN-DMN dysfunction in patients with MDD (n = 20) or SAD (n = 20). The long-term goal of this
proposal is to develop neuroscience-guided interventions that reduce SAB by remediating patient-specific
neural circuit dysfunction. To meet this goal, the candidate proposes training objectives supported by a
mentorship team with expertise in 1) basic and translational applications of TMS (Dr. Michael Esterman and
Dr. Joan Camprodon), 2) neural connectomics and individualized brain mapping (Dr. Jorge Sepulcre and Dr.
Mark Halko), and 3) conducting and evaluating clinical trials for experimental therapeutics (Dr. Charles Taylor
and Dr. Thomas Travison). The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that TMS protocols over patient-
specific right dlPFC targets will rescue (continuous theta-burst; cTBS) or not modulate (sham) dysregulated AA
motivational responses and task-related pgACC-dlPFC connectivity to social reward-threat conflict as well as
intrinsic SN-DMN connectivity. Thus, the current study proposes a cross-over clinical trial with specific aims to
characterize transdiagnostic effects of personalized cTBS on these processes. This approach is innovative
because it uses personalized neuromodulation guided by both patient-specific neural network topography and
functionality underlying dysregulated motivational processes. The proposed study is significant because it has
the potential to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of SAB and provide crucial data towards
developing a precision-medicine approach that utilizes personalized neuromodulation to effectively target and
reduce SAB. In sum, the candidate is fully committed to using the proposed project and training plan to build
an independent program of neuroimaging and neuromodulation research to delineate and remediate neural
circuitry underlying social dysfunction across internalizing disorders."
10931511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) takes the life of an American approximately every 12 minutes and
disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic patients, who experience higher rates of morbidity
and mortality compared to non-Hispanic white patients. Since the incidence of PDAC is relatively modest, even
among higher risk groups, screening is not feasible. Thus, improvements in outcomes require an improved
understanding of PDAC biology to guide development of effective therapies. Here, the partnering PI’s
complementary expertise in PDAC biology and modeling cellular biophysical properties converge to investigate
mechanisms of PDAC cell migration and metastasis, the primary cause of death in this patient population.
The Lowy laboratory focused on identifying therapeutic targets by performing unbiased discovery in PDAC vs.
normal pancreas. They hypothesized that super enhancer associated genes, which define cell identity, would
be effective therapeutic targets for PDAC. One differentially acetylated enhancer region was mapped to the
MICAL2 gene, that encodes a flavin monooxygenase. This protein drives F-actin depolymerization, that in the
cytosol can restructure the actin myosin machinery used to migrate and respond to external mechanical and
biochemical signals. MICAL2 also plays a role in linking nuclear actin dynamics to serum response factor
(SRF) transcription. Myocardin-related transcription factors (MTRFs) are co-activators of SRF; when nuclear
actin depolymerization is induced by MICAL2, globular actin is targeted for nuclear export, freeing MTRF to
bind SRF and activate transcription of genes important for cell adhesion and migration. Studies in PDAC cells
reveal that silencing MICAL2 expression impairs cell migration and metastasis.
The Katira laboratory in collaboration with Dr. Engler’s group have reported that cell adhesiveness serves as a
biophysical marker for metastatic potential, and both adhesiveness and contractility enable adurotaxis, the
ability of cells to migrate regardless of a stiffness gradient. To goal of this project is to define how MICAL2
influences properties of adhesiveness and durotaxis, and how it may regulate properties, not only of the cancer
cell, but of the tumor microenvironment through regulation of gene expression. We hypothesize that MICAL2
promotes PDAC cell invasion and metastasis by cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous
mechanisms. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims; 1) Determine how MICAL2 modulates
adherence and durotaxis in pancreatic cancer cells, 2) Determine how MICAL2 promotes pancreatic cancer
cell migration and metastasis, and 3) Determine how MICAL2 related signaling from cancer an stromal cells
modulates the tumor microenvironment. As a putative therapeutic target, our goal is to determine how MICAL2
functionally regulates cell migration and metastatic capacity during PDAC progression. This knowledge will be
key to understanding how and when MICAL2 activity can be targeted in PDAC."
10761700,"Atherosclerosis accounts for the majority of deaths in the United States and is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in the arterial wall. Arterial lipid accumulation results from the imbalance of cellular lipoprotein uptake, removal of cholesterol and de novo cellular lipid synthesis. The lymphatic network is an indispensable player in the removal of cholesterol and inflammatory cells/cytokines from atherosclerotic lesions. Surgical and genetic disruption of lymphatic drainage leads to aggravated atherosclerotic lesion formation. However, the precise endogenous factors and mechanisms regulating lymphangiogenesis in atherosclerotic vessels remain unidentified. Previous studies have linked elevated matrix protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) levels with human atherosclerotic disease, however the mechanisms by which TSP1 contributes to atherosclerotic lesion formation and its effect on arterial lymphangiogenesis remain unknown. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that i) lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) express high levels of TSP1 receptor, CD47; ii) TSP1 at pathophysiologically relevant concentrations inhibits lymphangiogenesis in vitro; and iii) global deletion of TSP1 and CD47 in hypercholesteremic mice attenuates atherosclerosis. Based on these results, I hypothesize that TSP1 impairs lymphangiogenesis via CD47-dependent mechanisms and induction of lymphangiogenesis via LEC CD47 deletion increases reverse cholesterol transport and decreases atherosclerosis development. The proposal will examine in vitro whether TSP1-mediated CD47 activation in LEC inhibits lymphangiogenesis via increased ROS generation, decreased NO bioavailability and attenuation of PI3K-Akt and ERK1/2 activation (Aim 1). The proposal will investigate whether inhibiting CD47 signaling specifically in LEC increases lymphangiogenesis, improves reverse cholesterol transport (Aim 2) and suppresses atherosclerosis development in vivo (Aim 3). Various molecular biology and imaging techniques, ROS/NO detection methods, lymphangiogenesis assays, PCSK9-AAV8-induced atherosclerosis model, in vivo reverse cholesterol transport, lymphatic function analysis and LEC-specific CD47 knockout mice will be employed to test the hypothesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel function in atherosclerosis. This grant will be critical for Dr. Singla to achieve the following short- and long- term objectives: 1) to acquire additional scientific training both methodologically and conceptually; 2) to merge the yet distinct matrix protein biology and lymphatics fields with the goals toward opening up new avenues of discovery; 3) to establish Dr. Singla’s independent research program; 4) publish high-impact corresponding author articles and develop a highly competitive R01 grant application. Dr. Singla has assembled a multidisciplinary team, including his mentors, consultants, and advisors to guide his career towards independence and assist with the completion of the proposed research study."
10761791,"Sepsis and other critical illnesses remain significant hazards to human health. Sepsis is particularly challenging
because it is associated with great heterogeneity that has kept the identification of diagnostic and predictive bi-
omarkers and effective pharmacotherapy elusive. Adverse drug reactions are among the top six leading cause
of morbidity and mortality in the nation. To tackle these problems, my research program employs Translational
Metabolomics which bridges the translational gap between analytical and experimental techniques and the
clinical application of the science of metabolomics. Specifically, it is aimed at applying metabolomics to: 1) in-
crease understanding of the metabolic processes that underlie clinically challenging problems like sepsis; and
2) improve prediction of drug response (pharmacometabolomics), including adverse drug reactions. We have
an innovative swine model of sepsis that faithfully recapitulates the human situation, novel point-of-care (POC)
technology and can assay biospecimens using a range of analytical platforms including liquid chromatography
(LC)-mass spectroscopy (MS) and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our recent progress has
led to paramount findings about the mechanisms that underlie sepsis responsiveness to L-carnitine, metabolic
adaptiveness and adverse drug reactions. Our pharmacometabolomics approach introduced the idea of meta-
bolic provocation to identify latent sepsis phenotypes. We have also determined that blood carnitine concentra-
tions serve as a signal of metabolic stress that may predispose to adverse drug reactions. Under this MIRA
(R35) application, the overarching and long-term goal of my program is to move metabolomics from knowledge
discovery to implementation that will drive the transformation of the care of patients with critical illnesses. To
achieve this, we will address three key gaps in knowledge: 1) The metabolic crisis timeline of critical illnesses
like sepsis is, and its trajectories are, poorly understood; 2) there is limited understanding of the mechanistic
underpinnings that contribute to metabolic adaptiveness and flexibility in sepsis; and 3) there is an absence of
fundamental understanding of the metabolic mechanisms that underlie the variance in drug response including
adverse drug reactions. With the assistance of productive, ongoing collaborations with an analytical chemist
and bio-informaticist, we expect this work will bring about a paradigm shift in the understanding of the mecha-
nistic underpinnings of sepsis and drug response. Long-term, we expect that the found sepsis-induced meta-
bolic defects, evidenced by altered carnitine and acyl-carnitine profiles, will lead to the identification of new
drug target opportunities, diagnostic and prognostic biomarker candidates and new POC technology that will
drive the early, reliable detection of sepsis. In addition, we will have new insights into the mechanisms that di-
rect and differentiate drug response including ADRs. Collectively, this work will provide a precision medicine
directive for the effective treatment of sepsis, fuel the advancement of well-informed adaptive clinical trial de-
sign, and improve human health."
10930131,"SUMMARY
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts for 10% of ICU admissions worldwide, with a mortality
as high as 46%. ARDS incidence has risen dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite improvements
in critical care and early detection of lung injury, the management of ARDS remains largely supportive. Although
mechanical ventilation may provide the necessary life support, impaired pulmonary mechanics and subsequent
ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) can impose a second insult that worsens outcomes. A range of insults,
including trauma, sepsis, pulmonary infections, or toxin exposure, are associated with acute lung injury (ALI) and
the subsequent development of a systemic inflammatory response and progression to ARDS, leading to
alterations in lung compliance and lung fibrosis. A central pathogenic feature of ARDS is the persistent activation
of inflammation and oxidative stress. Following ALI, lung macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that
result in the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Persistent amplification of inflammation and oxidative stress leads to the progression to ARDS, promotion of
long-term fibrosis and morbidity.
 Ceria Therapeutics is developing a novel therapeutic product, CTX-002, that synergistically targets both
inflammation and oxidative stress. CTX-002 (CNP-miR146a) is a cerium oxide nanoparticle (CNP), which
possess ROS scavenging properties, conjugated with an anti-inflammatory miR146a mimetic to target both ROS
and the inflammatory response. Supported by a Phase I application, we have demonstrated that a single
administration of CTX-002 can prevent bleomycin, MRSA, and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and
lung injury, even when administered three or seven days after injury. In addition, treatment with CTX-002 resulted
in improved pulmonary mechanics and prevention of subsequent VILI. We also demonstrated that systemic
intravenous single and repeat-dose administration of up to 10-fold the intended clinical dose of CTX-002 showed
no signs of toxicity in rats. The objectives of this Phase II proposal are to 1) determine pulmonary distribution of
CTX-002 in pigs to demonstrate that intratracheal administration of the drug results in no systemic exposure of
CTX-002 but increased concentration in the lungs; 2) scale-up synthesis and complete analytical
characterization, formulation and stability of CTX-002; 3) perform GLP-compliant safety and toxicology studies
in rats and pigs. To complete this Phase II application, we will prepare and submit an IND for clearance to begin
first-in-human clinical trials of CTX-002 for ARDS."
10903879,"During HIV infection, a reservoir of latently infected cells forms that persists during therapy, and
this reservoir represents the major barrier to an HIV cure. We and others have shown that HIV
latency is an epigenetic phenomenon, characterized by distinct changes to chromatin structure
and histone modifications that repress HIV gene expression, that can be transmitted through cell
division. This heritable property of latency allows the latent phenotype to survive ongoing clonal
expansion of infected cells in hosts and sustain the overall reservoir. Furthermore, viral silencing
and epigenetic programming is linked to global changes that occur within CD4 T cells as they
transition from an activated to a resting state. Fully defining the process by which the reservoir is
formed and by which latency is programmed will be essential to guiding novel approaches to
prevent reservoir seeding or maintenance. To date, studying the process of reservoir formation
during clinical HIV infection has been considered difficult, if not impossible, due to prior
observations suggesting that the reservoir forms very early during acute infection. Newer
information from several groups, however, has now revealed that the majority of the reservoir is
seeded by viruses that are actively replicating at the time of ART initiation, suggesting that ART
initiation triggers seeding of the reservoir. This observation raises the exciting possibility that
we could potentially study the process of reservoir seeding by longitudinal observation of CD4 T
cells from PWH in the immediately post ART period and, by doing so, reveal potential ways to
block the reservoir from forming at the time of therapy initiation. In this proposal we aim to
comprehensively define epigenetic and chromatin-based changes that occur in CD4 T cells in the
post ART period using samples derived from the A5248 cohort. CD4 T cells from these samples
will be profiled using a series of cutting-edge assays that have been established and validated in
our laboratory. These assays include combined single-cell multi-omic (RNAseq/ATACseq)
analysis, and high-resolution genome-wide mapping of multiple key histone modifications through
Cleavage Under Targets and Release using Nuclease (CUT&RUN). From this approach we will
achieve an integrated understanding of how heritable patterns of chromatin-based changes in
CD4 T cells are triggered by ART initiation and generate novel and critical insights into the
intracellular conditions that coincide with reservoir seeding in vivo. By achieving this goal, we will
reveal mechanisms that promote reservoir seeding and suggest novel approaches to block
reservoir formation at the time of ART initiation."

Puerto Rican (PR) Hispanic/Latino (H/L) men have the highest prostate cancer (PCa) mortality among Hispanic
populations. According to the recent PR Cancer Registry data, PCa is the leading cancer type in terms of
incidence (35% of all cancer cases) and mortality (17% of all cancer deaths) in PR H/L men. They have
significantly higher PCa-specific mortality than non-Hispanic white (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) men;
addressing this gap constitutes our central efforts. While socioeconomic status and access to healthcare are
contributors, manifest differences in molecular features between racial groups highlight the role of tumor biology
in racially disparate outcomes in PCa. Our long-term goal is to identify DNA methylation biomarkers driving gene
expression changes that underly PCa therapy resistance and aggressiveness in at-risk populations, particularly
PR H/L men. The central hypothesis is that differences in tumor DNA methylation patterns and population
admixture are associated with drug response and aggressiveness in PCa in PR H/L men. The rationale is that
identifying the molecular basis of PCa disparities will serve to reduce the burden of lethal PCa disparities affecting
PR H/L men. Our goals will be accomplished through two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Investigate associations between
aggressiveness and methylated genes in PCa among the PR H/L population and the impact of methylation on
their expression. (1a) Investigate differentially methylated genes associated with drug resistance and
aggressiveness among PR H/L PCa patients and compare with methylation data from NHB from the Florida PCa
biobank, NHW PCa patients from MCC, and TCGA. (1b) Evaluate differential DNA methylation on gene
expression patterns. We will establish comparisons with previous data obtained from NHW men from MCC and
TCGA. (1c) Evaluate whether population admixture will modify the methylation level of PR-specific methylated
genes. Further, we will investigate whether genes that contain ancestry determinants are associated with the
aggressiveness of PCa and disparity. Aim 2. Assess the contribution of DNA methylation to PCa resistance to
standard therapies using drug-resistant PCa sublines and liquid biopsies from PCa patients progressing after
treatment. (2a) Identify differentially methylated genes associated with drug-resistant phenotypes using cell-
based models of drug resistance including castration resistance, enzalutamide resistance, and docetaxel
resistance. (2b) Evaluate the expression of differentially methylated genes in resistant sublines compared to
sensitive cell lines. (2c) Assess the effect of DNA methylation inhibition on drug sensitivity in resistant
phenotypes. (2d) As an exploratory aim, we will evaluate resistance-associated methylation profiles in blood
samples from PR and MCC patients previously treated with androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor-
targeting agents, or taxane-based chemotherapy. The identification and validation of novel DNA methylation
signatures associated with aggressive and drug-resistant PCa in PR men have the potential to improve risk
stratification and treatment selection in this high-risk, understudied population."
10931489,"ABSTRACT | PILOT RESEARCH PROJECT
Transmen (TM) and non-binary individuals (NB; individuals assigned female sex at birth who identify as a man,
male, or another diverse non-binary gender identity on the masculine spectrum) are at higher risk of screening-
detectable cancers. The incidence of cervical cancer among Latinx (a gender-neutral term designating
Hispanics/Latinos (H/L)) is the highest among all ethnic groups in the US. Thus, Latinx TM and NB (LTM-NB)
are at a higher risk for cervical cancer as they lie at the intersection (i.e., gender and ethnic minorities) of two
populations that experience health disparities for this disease. Individual and interpersonal level factors in
interactions with health care providers such as the gendered nature of testing, “misgendering” or use of incorrect
pronouns, and avoidance to discuss issues about body parts associated with their assigned at birth gender have
been identified as some of the key aspects driving cervical cancer disparities among LTM-NB. In addition,
healthcare providers’ negative attitudes and insensitivity can contribute to emotional discomfort for testing,
adding another screening barrier. Our previous studies among LTM-NB in Puerto Rico and Florida show that
providers lack knowledge about specific healthcare needs, have negative stigmatizing attitudes, and manifest
discriminatory behaviors in clinical interactions with LTM-NB. However, although there are existing guidelines to
foster cancer early detection and prevention among TM, no guidelines or interventions address the increased
disparities encountered by ethnic minority LTM-NB. We developed a brief online intervention to improve medical
students’ competencies for cervical cancer education and screening promotion among LTM- NB. The efficacy of
this intervention has already been tested and exhibited medium to large effect sizes. The Aims of this proposed
study are: Aim 1) Test the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing medical students’ knowledge, attitudes,
and skills for providing healthcare to LTM-NB. This will be achieved by conducting a randomized controlled trial
with participants from Ponce Health Science University and from Moffitt Cancer Center-University of South
Florida. Quantitative measures (knowledge and attitudes) and SPS direct observations (behaviors) will be
collected to examine the intervention’s effectiveness. The rationale for this aim is to determine the additional
effect of the measure. Aim 2) Determine the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of implementing the
interventions in real-world medical educational settings. We will implement quantitative self-report measures and
individual interviews with a sub-sample of participants from the experimental condition (n=10) to examine
implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility). The impact of this study will reveal
new effective interventions and implementation strategies. The translational implications of this work will result
in providing medical schools with a cross-cultural tool to train students on cervical cancer prevention for LTM-
NB."

The Research Education Core (REC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University and Moffitt Cancer Center
Partnership has built an educational program that supports participants across the career continuum preparing
them for basic or clinical oncology-related careers. The long-term goal of the REC is to increase the recruitment,
advancement, and quality of cancer research scientists and oncologists from the Puerto Rican and
Hispanic/Latino (H/L) population while advancing health disparities research focused on this population. Through
ongoing interactions with all components of the Partnership, the REC’s educational framework (2007-2022) has
resulted in: 125 participants obtaining faculty, medical, or industry/federal/academic positions with 30 in
hematology-oncology clinical practice; completion of 137 research rotations by PhD, MD or PsyD students;
guidance of 22 Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs); and the creation of new courses, clerkships, and robust cancer
and health disparities seminar series. Leveraging our prior successes the REC strategy is designed to jointly
engage participants across career levels and institutes to create a lasting peer mentoring network which will be
accomplished under the following aims: Aim 1 engages H/L undergraduate students at both PHSU and MCC,
eight total per year, in a new two-year-plus program with year-round mentoring and research experiences
combined with intensive summer research immersion to promote conceptual change in preconceived ideas of
limited opportunities and ‘fit’ for STEM and cancer research. Aim 2 establishes two-year diversity post-doctoral
scholarships at MCC for H/L fellows to support career success with a focus on cancer health disparities and
minority health; and also establishes career development scholarships for late-stage PHSU PhD students to
support career enhancement activities and successful transition to post-doctoral training. Two rolling scholarship
slots are available at each site. The scholarships are interwoven with training in cultural competency,
professionalism, scientific writing, and health disparities to successfully promote a path toward independence.
Aim 3 addresses the need to increase the number of H/L medical residents and medical students entering an
oncology career track. REC will facilitate the creation of the first urology residency program in PR, enable surgical
oncology training at MCC for two PR surgical residents per year, and immerse eight medical students per year
in a summer cancer research experience alongside PhD students. Aim 4 enhances the career development of
ESIs by providing individualized support for each ESI through collaborative interactions, health disparities
training, grant/scientific writing workshops, career development activities, identifying networking opportunities,
and tracking, and evaluating ongoing mentorship and sponsorship. In sum, REC trainees will gain cancer
research and health disparities experience through exposure to Partnership projects and Cores. The REC
outcomes will support the overall Partnership objectives by building and strengthening trainee career pathways
at critical career transition points, resulting in a more diverse pool of oncologists and research scientists."

The Outreach Core (OC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center (PHSU-MCC)
Partnership provides community outreach and education to improve cancer screening behaviors in underserved
populations. Currently, over 60 million persons identify as Hispanic/Latino (H/L), comprising almost 18% of the
continental United States (US) population, with an additional 3.1 million US citizens residing in Puerto Rico (PR).
Despite unique socio-cultural and biological characteristics in sub-ethnic groups, H/L populations tend to be
viewed in aggregate. Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans are the largest sub-ethnic groups among US H/Ls.
Efforts to achieve equity require an approach rooted in the knowledge and incorporation of both the
characteristics and preferences of the specific communities. Indeed, one-third of H/Ls report that they obtain at
least some health information from community-based organizations. The overall goal of the OC is to increase
community cancer awareness, community engagement, and participation in cancer health disparities research
and outreach in H/L communities. Working closely with other Partnership cores and investigators, the team
proposes to elevate and expand its activities to facilitate reciprocal communication between community members
and partnership researchers through OC educational activities, training opportunities, supporting participant
recruitment efforts, and incorporation of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP) feedback on partnership research
projects. Together with community members and Partnership researchers, the OC will increase cancer
awareness, community engagement, and participation in cancer health disparities research in the H/L
communities served by MCC (in FL) and PHSU (in PR) through the following three Specific Aims: 1) To develop,
deliver, and disseminate cancer education and outreach activities to H/L community members to reduce cancer
health disparities. The team will deliver cancer education to H/L communities in PR and FL using evidence-

interest identified by community members. 2) To enhance capacity for mutually beneficial research engagement
to address cancer health disparities. The team will facilitate communication between community members and
partnership investigators (e.g., CAP Research Corner), support partnership research that is responsive to
community needs (translational research), promote community participation in the partnership’s research
activities/projects to reduce cancer health disparities, and train researchers and community members in
community engagement principles. 3) To expand the capacity to train community members as lay health

Cancer 101, OC activities) in their local communities to address cancer health disparities."
10933481,"Cancer drugs in the United States are almost exclusively developed by, tested in, and optimized for European-
Americans. Disparities in U.S. drug development are the result of long-standing inequalities that occur throughout
the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic, translational, and clinical scientists are
Latino/Hispanic-American or African-American. Less than 2-5% of trial participants are Latino/Hispanic-
American or African-American. Yet, in spite of a lack of data, new drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and subsequently prescribed for Latino/Hispanic-American or African-American
patients, without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable, especially in this era of the Precision Medicine Initiative
(PMI), that our drugs are currently developed by, and optimized for, only an exclusive segment of our citizens.
We seek to shift this paradigm by strengthening the existing partnership between University of California at
Riverside (UCR) and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoHCCC). The goal of our U54 Research
Education Core is for UCR and CoHCCC to collaboratively develop the research infrastructure and training
programs necessary to develop the next generation of therapeutics researchers that reflect the ethnic diversity
of Inland Southern California. To this end, the UCR – CoHCCC Research Education Core will integrate research
experiences, curriculum development, and outreach education activities that focus on 1) opportunities in drug
discovery, 2) resources to translate basic science discovery to drive drug development, and 3) training in the
biology, ethics, and social determinants of disparities. Aim 1 will develop research pathways to increase capacity
in drug development and clinical trials. Aim 2 will develop courses to introduce both UCR and CoH students and
faculty to methods and innovation in drug development and the health science of disparities. (students, PDF,
early stage investigators (ESI), established faculty). Aim 3 will 1) expose students, PDF, ESI to career
opportunities in drug development and clinical trials and 2) provide training and capacity building."

 The Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility (BTRF) makes human biospecimens available for basic,
translational, and clinical research. It is the major conduit through which human tissue specimens are
transferred from the Pathology, Surgery, and other clinical departments to research labs at the University of
Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) and is the major processor of human biofluids (blood, urine, etc.) in support
of clinical trials at the UVACC. The biorepository functions are supported by a robust informatics platform that
is integrated with other clinical and research informatics resources. In addition, this facility provides standard
histology services and complex histology-based analytic techniques for animal models of cancer as well as
human tissues, including tissue microarray construction, laser microdissection, immunohistochemistry
(including multi-color chromogens), RNA in situ hybridization, and digital slide scanning with automated image
analysis. The BTRF provides expert histopathology support from Board-certified Anatomic Pathologists. The
biorepository and analytic services are often vertically integrated with each other, including procedures in other
Shared Resources, to allow for “one-stop shopping” for investigators carrying out translational or clinical cancer
research. Examples include next generation sequencing or RNA microarray analysis carried out in the
Biomolecular Analysis Facility from nucleic acids extracted from tissue samples by the BTRF; and circulating
tumor cell analysis carried out in the Flow Cytometry Core from blood samples processed in the BTRF. BTRF
services enable new insights into cancer disease mechanisms via the analysis of tissues and biofluids, assist
in the discovery and validation of new clinical cancer biomarkers, and support clinical trials of therapies for

10888183,"Project Abstract:
 The association between decreased plasma IgG sialylation and a variety of inflammatory diseases has
been known for decades. The downstream effects of changes in IgG sialylation have been studied in depth, and
it is now believed that decreases in sialylation increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, thereby
driving immune activation throughout the body. Although the downstream effects of dysregulated IgG sialylation
have been well documented, the regulatory mechanisms controlling IgG sialylation remain unknown. If these
mechanisms are elucidated, they may serve as novel therapeutic targets to manipulate IgG function to either
enhance or suppress IgG-based inflammation, depending on the circumstances. Previous research has
suggested that, unlike many other glycoproteins, IgG is not sialylated efficiently during the secretory process,
pointing to a B cell-extrinsic mechanism in which IgG sialylation is dynamically regulated following its release
into the bloodstream. Therefore, the goals of the proposed studies are (1) to identify key regulatory mechanisms
underlying IgG sialylation and (2) to elucidate how inflammatory signals are translated into changes in the IgG
glycan. The success of this study will be characterized by revealing a novel and dynamic mechanism regulating
IgG function through regulated changes in glycan sialylation, while providing cutting-edge scientific and
professional training that blends both glycobiology and immunology to facilitate a career trajectory focused upon
leadership in IgG-based therapies and translational science."
10930012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed study will investigate the role of persistent activity of the lateral prefrontal cortex in object working
memory using a non-human primate model. Persistent activity of the prefrontal cortex has long been speculated
as the neural correlate of working memory. In recent years alternative models have been proposed, particularly
for object working memory. We hypothesize that persistent activity plays a causal role in reflecting the features
of remembered stimuli, rather merely representing parameters of the task that subjects perform or highlighting
the spatial location of remembered objects. Rhesus macaques will thus be trained in a feature working memory
task that will require them to remember and make judgments about visual stimuli. We will record neural activity
with a chronic array of microelectrodes, distributed across the surface of the lateral prefrontal cortex, both before
and after training. We will test whether the peak of population activity can explain what stimulus the monkeys
ultimately remember, and whether drift of this peak of activity over time predicts errors. We will additionally
determine how neuronal responses are affected by training by using familiar and novel stimuli in the context of
the same working memory task. Moreover, we will directly test the causality of this persistent activity by applying
microsimulation on carefully selected electrodes, to cause the animals to erroneously recall not the actual
stimulus presented, but the preferred stimulus of the site being stimulated. As a result, the proposed experiments
will determine the specific, causal mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex that are ultimately responsible for
mediating visual working memory."
10930013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gliomas has been steadily shifting from a histological
classification towards a molecular classification. For example, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutational status
is a critical feature of the recent 2021 WHO classification. Compared to IDH-wild-type (IDH-wt) gliomas, IDH-
mutant (IDH-m) gliomas have distinct clinical characteristics such as accounting for most low-grade gliomas
(LGGs; grade 2), having better prognosis, growing slower, and affecting a younger patient population compared
to IDH-wt gliomas. However, all WHO grade 2 IDHm gliomas are expected to eventually become malignant
higher-grade (WHO grades 3-4) gliomas in a process known as malignant transformation. Upon malignant
transformation, patients with IDHm gliomas have a significantly worse prognosis. Thus, early, non-invasive
imaging biomarkers of IDHm glioma malignant transformation may allow for earlier identification of treatment
failure and appropriate therapeutic interventions.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for the management of patients with IDHm gliomas. Currently,
identification of malignant transformation in patients with IDHm gliomas involves the emergence of contrast-
enhancing areas on T1-post-contrast MRI in previously non-enhancing grade 2 gliomas. However, advanced
MRI biomarkers sensitive to acidity, perfusion, and cellular density may provide earlier identification of the tumor
microenvironment changes associated with malignant transformation and earlier identification of treatment
failure. Furthermore, combining our lab’s pH-sensitive MRI with metabolic positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging may yield deeper insights into the tumor microenvironment, particularly for metabolic shifts associated
with malignant transformation and new IDH inhibitor targeted therapies that inhibit the mutant IDH enzyme. As
a result, this proposal seeks to identify molecular MR-PET biomarkers associated with malignant transformation
and successful IDH inhibition of IDHm gliomas.
 In Specific Aim 1, we will establish a sequential order of advanced MRI biomarkers in IDHm gliomas
undergoing malignant transformation using pH-sensitive, perfusion, diffusion, and anatomical MRI and then
validate MR-PET biomarkers of IDHm gliomas with histopathological markers from targeted surgical biopsies. In
Specific Aim 2, we will utilize pH-sensitive MRI and PET to evaluate metabolic perturbations in IDHm gliomas
following successful IDH inhibitor therapy. The proposed studies may improve IDHm glioma management by
establishing imaging biomarkers of malignant transformation and successful IDH inhibitor treatment response."
10752713,"Project Summary
The goals of this proposal are to investigate fundamental mechanisms of chromatin modifiers
which, when perturbed, may create conditions that can lead to cancer and other diseases in
humans. These studies will largely focus on chromatin remodeling complexes (e.g. Swi/Snf) and
proteins which modify histones (e.g. methylation, phosphorylation) in response to transcription,
cell signaling and metabolism. The Swi/Snf nucleosome-remodeling complex functions as a
tumor suppressor. Recurrent mutations in Swi/Snf are found in many cancers. This proposal
focuses on novel functions of Swi/Snf complexes in yeast and mammalian cells that may
contribute to cancer development when lost. Many subunits of the mammalian Swi/Snf complex
have alternative paralog subunits which occupy different versions. Importantly, depletion of
multiple paralogs of specific subunits has been shown to be synthetic lethal in cancer cell lines
suggesting potential therapeutic avenues. We will investigate the redundant and nonredundant
functions of paralogous subunits starting with ARID1A/ARID1B and SMARCA2/SMARCA4
(alternative ATPase subunits). We have found that ARID1B (but not ARID1A) interacts with
paraspeckle (ribonucleoprotein particle) components and regulates splicing. We will explore the
mechanisms and functions of Swi/Snf interactions with paraspeckles. We have discovered that
SMARCA2 bromodomain undergoes acetylation unlike its paralog SMARCA4. We will
investigate how this modification affects the activities of SMARCA2-containing Swi/Snf
complexes including their interactions with acetylated nucleosomes. In yeast we have found that
Swi/Snf regulates a number of genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (The MET
regulon). We will investigate the role of Swi/Snf in controlling the transcription factor Met4 and
the MET regulon in general which is of particular interest due to the role of Met4 and the MET
regulon in regulating cellular processes such as redox homeostasis, methylation, phospholipid
metabolism, protein synthesis and cell cycle progression. Our discovery that the mammalian
SETD2 methyltransferase interacts with RNA processing proteins (e.g. hnRNPL) has led us to
investigate how these interactions regulate histone methylation during transcription and RNA
splicing and processing. Finally, in yeast we discovered a nutrient sensing signaling pathway
combining the CK2 and AMPK pathways to converge on the Tda1 kinase which phosphorylates
histone H3T11 and activates stress responsive genes. Proposed studies will investigate
regulation of Tda1, the functions of H3T11 phosphorylation in gene activation and whether this
nutrient sensing pathway is conserved in mammals."

take part in workshop sessions. The many physiologic roles fulfilled by the human placenta in
support of fetal growth and development means that placental research is truly multidisciplinary
and meetings of the placental research community bring together clinicians, translational and
basic scientists of various specializations. Often these are individuals whose primary focus is
not the placenta but who recognize that their talents can be brought to bear on investigations in
this most multifaceted area. The highly successful annual IFPA meeting has served to bring
together clinicians and scientists, established senior, mid-career and junior investigators from
around the world, to report and discuss their findings in an atmosphere conducive to frank yet
amicable exchange. Meetings are scheduled in September/October of each year in Buenos
Aires, Argentina (2019), Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2020), Rotarua, New Zealand (2021),
Montreal, Canada (2022), Europe (2023) and Japan (2024). The meeting duration is 3 - 3 1/2
days with up to eight plenary sessions addressing specific aspects of placental function. The
main speaker in each plenary gives a state of the art presentation and is not necessarily a
placental biologist. Plenary sessions are accompanied by a corresponding interactive 2-hour
workshop session addressing controversial questions. At least two 3-hour poster discussion
sessions are scheduled and posters are displayed for the entire meeting to allow time for in
depth discussion of work particularly of new investigators. Oral sessions for new investigators
and trainees are scheduled with the best abstracts selected for these by the program
committee. Prizes are awarded for the best oral presentation and best poster presentations by
trainees or new investigators. Trainees and new investigators will be selected based on
competitive review of submitted first author abstracts for award of travel funds. The US–based
senior investigator will be selected by the meeting organizer and PI of this proposal.
There is always a high proportion (up to 60%) of women attendees, speakers and session
chairs at IFPA meetings ensuring adequate representation. In the last 14 years a previous
conference grant (PI: Myatt) has supported 121 young investigators of whom 89 were female
and 37 minorities. A significant majority are still engaged in the field."

 Zambia is struggling to meet the 95-95-95 targets for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). HIV
prevalence in 15-19 year-olds is 3.3%, and AGYW are 4 times more likely to acquire HIV than their male peers
(8.6% vs. 2.1%). HIV incidence increased in AGYW from 2010-2020 while decreasing in all other groups, yet HIV
testing rates are low (45.4%), and 71.2% do not know their HIV status. The proposed hybrid trial will evaluate the
effectiveness and implementation of a CDC “best-evidence” intervention, Informed Motivated Aware and
Responsible Adolescents and Adults (IMARA), recently adapted for South Africa (IMARA-SA) with promising
effects on AGYW STI incidence, sexual risk taking, PrEP uptake, and mental health. Guided by the Exploration,
Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment framework and an Implementation Research Logic Model, this study
addresses a key driver of poor sustainability of evidence-based programs in low-resource settings - attrition in
health workforce due to mental distress and low job satisfaction – by evaluating the impact of mental health
screening and referral on peer leaders delivering IMARA. Building on preliminary focus groups with key
stakeholders in Zambia, the study aims to: (1) Tailor IMARA-SA for the Zambian context to produce ZAIMARA; (2)
Compare the effects of ZAIMARA vs. a general health promotion program on AGYW HIV testing uptake at 6
months (primary clinical outcome), incident STIs (including HIV), sexual behavior, and PrEP uptake (secondary
clinical outcomes) at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24 months. (3) Examine the impact of mental health screening and
referral vs. a general check-in on peer leader job retention. (4) Evaluate ZAIMARA implementation outcomes using
mixed methods and key informant interviews. The partnership between the Centre for Infectious Disease Research
in Zambia (CIDRZ) and the Center for Dissemination and Implementation Science (CDIS) in the United States will
ensure the expertise needed to complete the study in five geographically distinct communities in Lusaka Province,
the region with the highest HIV prevalence in Zambia, while building capacity for implementation science research.
This is a theoretically-grounded, hypothesis-driven hybrid-trial that addresses critical gaps in the HIV prevention
continuum for Zambian AGYW, with a long-term goal to sustain effective programs that reduce HIV/STI infections."

 Autograft is considered the gold standard for large bone defect repair and reconstruction. The superior
healing potential of autografts is attributed to the robust osteogenic and angiogenic activities of periosteum– a
highly vascularized thin tissue membrane covering the outer surface of bone. To recapitulate the superior
healing potential of periosteum, a series of tissue engineering strategies have been developed, aiming to
construct a biomimetic tissue-engineered periosteum (TEP) for enhanced bone defect repair and
reconstruction. The success of these strategies hinges on a thorough understanding of the osteogenic and
angiogenic role of periosteum and a better insight into the intricate relationship between bone and vessel
forming cells at the regenerative interface of periosteum-mediated repair. Supported by NIH funding, we have
made a series of progresses in construction of a biomimetic functional periosteum and in understanding of the
functional vascular bed at the site of periosteal repair utilizing transgenic animals that label subtypes of
endothelial cells. Building on these progresses, the proposed work will focus on understanding the molecular
control of periosteum-mediated bone-specialized vessel formation, with further efforts devoted to building a
technological platform for controlled delivery of angiogenic and osteogenic factors for reconstruction of a pro-
angiogenic and pro-osteogenic periosteum mimetic for augmented bone allograft repair. The completion of the
proposed study will provide new insights into the molecular control of bone-specialized blood vessel formation
during periosteum-mediated repair, further offering engineering-based strategies targeting osteogenic and
angiogenic interface for augmented defect repair at a compromised periosteal site."
10951512,"Project Summary:
Pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs) typically harbor only a single oncogenic driver event which almost
universally result in MAPK pathway activation. The most frequent of these alterations is a rearrangement that
fuses the C-terminus of BRAF to the large transmembrane protein KIAA1549. Many patients whose tumors
harbor this fusion respond to BRAF inhibitors, but challenges remain in extending clinical benefit to all patients.
A key challenge is that patients require chronic treatment with these inhibitors throughout childhood because
tumors often rebound upon cessation of treatment. These inhibitors are associated with significant dose-limiting
toxicity issues, likely because the MAPK pathway is essential for brain development. These observations suggest
that we need to identify new therapeutic targets for pLGG.
The two core members of the POMT complex and two complex cofactors emerged as the top four dependencies
in a genome-scale loss of function CRISPR/Cas9 screen. This dependency was specific for cells harboring the
KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and were not dependencies in cells expressing BRAFV600E. The POMT complex is
necessary for O-mannosylation of secreted and transmembrane proteins. This is striking because across all
proteins in the human proteome, KIAA1549 one of the proteins most affected by this post-translational
modification. It was originally hypothesized that the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion activates BRAF by truncating its
negative regulatory domain, but this observation suggests that the KIAA1549 portion of the fusion may also be
necessary for activating BRAF.
The primary goals of this proposal are to understand why the POMT complex is a vulnerability in KIAA1549-
BRAF mutant cells, and to understand how the KIAA1549 portion of KIAA1549-BRAF regulates the activity of
the fusion. In Aim 1 I will test the hypothesis that POMT complex activity is necessary for the survival of
KIAA1549-BRAF-dependent cells. In Aim 2 I will test the hypothesis that the POMT complex is required for O-
mannosylation of KIAA1549-BRAF, and that O-mannosylation of KIAA1549-BRAF is necessary for oncogenic
signaling. In Aim 3 I will test the hypothesis that the KIAA1549 portion of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion tethers
BRAF to the plasma membrane and enhances its ability to activate the MAPK pathway."

Nausea and vomiting promote mammalian survival. Paradoxically, emetic “side effects” are ubiquitously
reported for FDA-approved pharmacotherapeutics for obesity, diabetes, and cancer pharmacotherapies and
present alongside polymorbidities that contribute to detrimental life-threatening outcomes, such as poor
nutrition, quality of life, and patient prognosis. Here, we address two broad unmet clinical needs: 1) All existing
FDA-approved glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes and obesity
elicit nausea and vomiting in a significant percentage of patients. 2) Despite existing antiemetic treatments
available, virtually all patients undergoing chemotherapy continue to exhibit profound debilitating symptoms,
such as severe nausea, vomiting, and cachexia. We use modern behavioral and neurogenetic approaches, and
appropriate, comparative, preclinical animal models that are critical to produce novel, effective, long-term
controls of nausea and vomiting to advance modern metabolic health care. Intestinally derived GIP regulates
postprandial glucose through direct action on GIP receptors (GIPR) expressed on pancreatic beta cells. GIP
analog efficacy as a monotreatment of diabetes and obesity is at best limited and controversial, however, the
expression of CNS GIPRs in regions implicated in nausea/emesis have spawned investigation of central actions
of GIP ligands as potential adjunct therapeutics to reduce unwanted adverse events. Specifically, our data
support that GIPR and GLP-1R dual agonism provide body weight loss, hypophagia, and glucoregulatory control
without nausea and emesis, compared to GLP-1R agonism alone, through activation of the GIP system. The area
postrema (AP) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) play a critical role in
ingestive behavior, emesis, and nausea. Widely used emetogenic chemotherapeutics (e.g., cisplatin) and all FDA-
approved GLP-1-based ligands activate AP/NTS neurons. Our collective works suggest hindbrain GIPRs block
nausea and vomiting induced by GLP-1R and cisplatin chemotherapy in several animal species, suggesting
translational broad-spectrum antiemetic potential for GIPR agonists. We have identified cellular phenotypes of
AP/NTS GIPR- and GLP-1R- expressing cells, as well as shown the attenuation in AP/NTS neuron activity, and
preliminary data). Additionally, we have discovered a molecularly distinct GABA-ergic neuronal DVC population
that is modulated by chemotherapy but rescued by GIPR agonism. We hypothesize that there exists an antiemetic
system characterized by inhibitory (i.e., GABA-ergic) neurons expressing GIP receptors (GIPR). Here, we will:
Aim I: Examine behavioral, anatomical, and transcriptomic mechanisms by which GIPR-GABA+ AP/NTS
neurons exhibit antiemetic action. Aim II: Examine GIP antiemetic action in conjunction with established
antiemetics using a multi-species approach. Our data in multiple species all indicate that GIP agonism has an
antiemetic effect and here we use our unique multi-species approach to define the mechanisms of the GIP system
in reducing and/or preventing therapeutic drug-induced nausea and emesis."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects one in 44 children.
1 Early diagnosis is critical for optimizing
outcomes, yet children are not typically diagnosed until 4 years of age.2 In concert with early behavioral signs,
early neural markers could identify toddlers at risk of developing ASD to aid earlier diagnosis and targeted
interventions. Neuroimaging studies have primarily examined structural brain abnormalities in toddlers at high
risk of developing ASD3. A growing body of work provides evidence for functional brain network connectivity
alterations in older children with ASD (7-12 years of age).4 While innovative dynamic functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) methods reveal candidate brain networks of dysfunction underlying the heterogeneity
of the disorder and symptom severity in older children with ASD,567,8no study to date has evaluated the relationship
between brain network dynamics and behavioral outcomes in toddlers with ASD. Restricted and repetitive
behaviors (RRBs), core symptoms of ASD,9 are particularly understudied. The goal of this project is to identify
early functional brain biomarkers of ASD and brain-behavior relationships with RRB outcomes across mixed
clinical and typically developing (TD) groups. This study will utilize a dataset previously collected by the UCSD
ACE Center comprised of toddlers (12-36 months, n = 231) who were identified as either TD or at-risk for a
developmental disability using an early screening form (Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales
Developmental Profile; CSBS-DP).10Some toddlers were later diagnosed with ASD (n = 89), TD (n = 70), other
diagnosis (n = 72; Language Delay, Developmental Delay, and Autism Features). Since the sample includes
multiple diagnostic groups, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to examine early brain biomarkers for ASD
and RRBs across diagnostic categories, as envisioned by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach.11
Early behavioral indicators alone do not always clearly indicate which children will go onto to develop ASD.12 The
results from this study may lead to the development of reliable biomarkers to identify children at risk for ASD in
concert with overt behavioral signs of the disorder. Neural biomarkers of ASD and RRBs will in turn lead to earlier
and more efficient diagnosis and treatments. This work builds upon the applicant’s previous research experience
at the UCSD ACE Center collecting neuroimaging data from toddlers.13 The applicant has previously examined
dynamic brain biomarkers of RRB symptoms in older children with ASD (8-12 yo),7,14–16 reviewed the brain
biomarker literature in toddlers with ASD,3analyzed large lifespan neuroimaging datasets (n = 601), and gained
a foundation in statistics and clinical neuroscience. Through formal coursework and individual meetings, the
applicant plans to engage in four major areas of training: (1) cutting-edge analyses to assess brain dynamics
using functional neuroimaging data, (2) sophisticated statistical approaches for modelling longitudinal data, (3)
considerations for conducting research with young children at risk for autism, and (4) career development."

Overview of Research in the Lorigan Lab and 5 Year Goals
(Overview): Currently, we have limited structural information on membrane proteins. The Lorigan lab is
interested in developing new biophysical methods to probe the structural and dynamic properties of
integral membrane proteins using state-of-the-art pulsed EPR spectroscopic techniques and membrane
solubilizing polymers. The overall objective is to study membrane proteins with EPR in a lipid bilayer as
opposed to a detergent because it more closely mimics a cell membrane. Several proteins have been
shown to not function or fold up correctly in a micelle when compared to a lipid bilayer. This is
challenging because it is more difficult to express, purify, and conduct biophysical spectroscopic
experiments on membrane proteins in lipid bilayers when compared to micelle or globular systems. My
expertise in membrane protein EPR and sample preparation coupled with the powerful pulsed EPR
instrumentation (DEER and ESEEM) that can measure long range distances has attracted several
significant collaborators with important biological problems. My research lab works directly with several
researchers to dramatically improve the quality of membrane protein sample preparation to yield high
quality DEER data that leads to more accurate structural information. Please see the letters of support.
 The major biological focus of the lab is on investigating the structural and dynamic properties of
integral membrane proteins in the KCNE family which is responsible for the modulation of voltage gated
potassium (Kv) channels including KCNQ1 (Q1). This channel is expressed throughout the body to
regulate physiological functions and mutations in this channel are linked to several diseases such as
Long QT syndrome and other heart diseases. Increased understanding of the molecular underpinnings
of KCNE modulation of potassium channels, specifically Q1, would help expand our understanding of
the etiology of these diseases. We will study three members of the KCNE family: KCNE1(E1),
KCNE3(E3), and KCNE4(E4). We are currently applying state-of-the-art EPR techniques to directly
probe the structural and dynamic properties of Q1, E1, E3, and E4. This information will help us better
understand Q1 regulation.
 The following pertinent biological questions will be answered: Which segments of E3 and E4 are
helical in a lipid bilayer? What is the structure and topology of the KCNE3 and KCNE4 with respect to
the membrane? How does E1 bind and interact with Q1 that is required for function?
(5 Year Goals of the Lab): (1) Develop new biophysical techniques to dramatically improve
structural studies of membrane proteins, (2) Probe the structural and dynamic properties of E3, and E4,
(3) Elucidate the binding mechanism of E1 and Q1 to help us better understand the mechanism of Q1
regulation, and (4) Apply the membrane protein techniques that we develop to investigate the structure
of several biologically important integral membrane proteins (S2E Coronavirus Envelope Protein,
Canonical Holin, TRPV1, and Grp94) using pulsed EPR spectroscopy. The TRPV1 and GRP94
projects will be done via collaboration. Each lab will send us samples for pulsed EPR measurements.
Transformative biophysical techniques will be developed to study the structural and dynamic
properties of membrane proteins. These state-of-the-art pulsed EPR spectroscopic techniques will
move the field forward by dramatically increasing sensitivity and distance measurements of membrane
protein systems such as E3 and E4. Also, a new polymer-based membrane mimetic system will be
developed that will enable researchers to more easily conduct structural and functional measurements
of membrane proteins in a lipid bilayer. The size of the SMALPs can be fine-tuned by the polymer to
match the size of the membrane protein complex. The state-of-the-art pulse EPR techniques, unique
spin labels, and our powerful SMALPs membrane systems will dramatically improve our ability to study
the structure and dynamics of a wide variety of different membrane protein complexes of various sizes."

The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become
an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care
interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis
that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The
proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual
development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support
its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical
practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and
contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the
field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of
PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S
reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to
predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide
the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression.
The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care
children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career
development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with
complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world
renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of
mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and
internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat
chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics),
Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric
radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in
bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in

Approximately 25% of Americans over the age of 65 are living with diabetes (~12 million individuals), over 90% of which is type 2 diabetes, and the prevalence is expected to increase. Elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes have 50-100% higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) yet it remains unclear how to best mitigate this risk. From a public health standpoint it is imperative to evaluate potential risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD in this vulnerable population. There is some evidence that glycemic control and diabetes treatments play a role in AD/ADRD risk but studies in natural settings are need to identifying time-varying characteristics of long-term glycemic control associated with elevated AD/ADRD risk into consideration important contextual factors such comorbidities and diabetes pharmacotherapy. Our long-term goal is to identify modifiable risk factors of AD/ADRD risk among individuals with type 2 diabetes and to help inform interventions and clinical practice aimed at improving healthy brain aging among this at-risk population. We propose an innovative use of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry encompassing data collected from 1994-2018+ in over 115,000 elderly people with type 2 diabetes to engender a better understanding of the role of glycemic control and diabetes pharmacotherapy on AD/ADRD risk. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) Determine the longitudinal association between long-term glycemic control and risk of AD/ADRD in a large cohort of elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes and identify which patterns are most protective or harmful for AD/ADRD risk; 2) Understand the time-dependent interplay between micro- and macrovascular complications and long-term glycemic control on AD/ADRD risk; and 3) Evaluate the association between anti-hyperglycemic therapies (e.g. sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones, insulins) and risk of AD/ADRD while accounting for long-term glycemic control. Findings from the proposal will be directly inform treatment targets and therapeutic management of geriatric patients with diabetes, an increasing portion of our elderly population at high risk of AD/ADRD."
10766187,"There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these
differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system."
10767859,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The preterm birth rate in Harris County, Houston, TX is an alarming 13.6% (national average in US is 9.6%), and
in areas surrounding Superfund sites, the preterm birth (PTB) rate is even higher (>20%). There are 15
Superfund sites in Harris County, posing a significant health risk to people living in the vicinity of these sites.
PTB often leads to many complications, including chronic lung disease, also termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD), and some of these patients develop neurocognitive deficits later in life. One of the possible risk factors
for PTB are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), present in contaminated soil, sediments, and water at
various Superfund sites across the US, including in the greater Houston area. The over-arching hypothesis of
the BCM-Rice Superfund Research Program (SRP) is that maternal exposure to PAHs, which are present in
Superfund sites, increases the risk of PTB and incrementally augments major morbidities such as BPD and
neurocognitive deficits. The leaders of the Administrative and Research Translation Core (AC), Drs.
Bhagavatula Moorthy (Director), Pedro Alvarez (Deputy Director), Kjersti Aagaard, and Naomi Halas (Associate
Directors) will bring their collective scientific, educational, and leadership experience to guide the Baylor-Rice
SRP and address Superfund directives. The Administrative Core (AC) acts as the center of communication
within the Center, responsible for creating an efficient organizational structure. To this end, the Core will facilitate
interdisciplinary communication, collaboration, and integration of the Center’s Research Projects and cores.
Further, the Administrative Core will explore creative ways to promote investigator-initiated research translation
(IIRT) opportunities with assistance from the Research Translation Coordinators, Dr. Mellissa Bondy, and the
co-coordinator Dr. Philip Lupo. The AC will also play a key role in the communication with various external
stakeholders, including NIEHS and EPA, as well as with community partners, in close collaboration with the
Community Engagement Core (CEC). The AC will also take an active role with the Research Experience and
Training Coordination Core (RETCC) to create a vibrant training program and foster the development of
environmental health and science professionals. The Administrative Core will ensure financial responsibility and
management of the Center as well as work with the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) to ensure
responsible management of data. This will include working with the Project and Core Leaders, Office of
Research, and Departments to ensure accomplishment of the proposed aims. The AC will also collaborate with
sister SRPs as needed and will leverage support and resources so the goals of the BCM-Rice SRP are
accomplished in a timely and efficient manner and avoid duplication of efforts."
10767862,"Project Summary
Houston is the fourth-largest city in the United States, and its Port one of the busiest in the world. Lack of
zoning for industry and ignorance of the long-term effects of “legacy” pollutants have contributed to severe
environmental health issues in the region, with more than a dozen federal Superfund sites located in the
metroplex. The Ship Channel includes two major Superfund sites, with many more highly toxic sites managed
by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The focus of the B-R SRP on PAHs and their effects on
preterm birth and susceptibility to chronic respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases addresses a largely
heretofore-unmet need for identifying at-risk populations and developing new and innovative technologies for
identifying and ameliorating risk from PAHs. The Overall Goal of the CEC is to facilitate meaningful
bidirectional communication and interactions among the B-R SRP’s internal and external stakeholders. Our
Mission is to develop and adapt best practices to work with residents and local leaders of affected communities
to facilitate prevention and intervention strategies that will result in community-level reductions in exposure to
PAHs and other Superfund site pollutants. We are working with communities surrounding the Ship Channel
and Superfund sites, many of which are Environmental Justice communities, impacted by heavy
industrialization, poverty, and the environmental health effects of sites including the San Jacinto Waste Pits
and Patrick Bayou. Community partners will play an invaluable role in reaching targeted communities. The
Texas Health and Environment Alliance, Inc. spearheaded by Executive Director Jackie Young, represents all
neighborhoods impacted by the San Jacinto River Waste Pits. Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy
Services is a broad-based, internationally recognized, non-profit group headed by Juan Parras, who for 25
years has been dedicated to advocacy, education, and providing resources to Houston neighborhoods
disproportionately impacted by pollution, poverty, and neglect. Our Specific Aims are to: 1.Utilize new and
existing multi-directional communication strategies to increase investigator and community capacity for
collaborating to reduce exposures to PAHs and other Superfund contaminants. 2. Assist and support B-R SRP
Research Project and Core community-engagement activities through community forums, a robust Stakeholder
Advisory Board, and Community Science Workshops. 3. Support community projects to reduce exposures to
Superfund PAHs such as educational interventions for pregnant women, well water screening and soil testing,
community gardening activities and instruction to prevent exposure to harmful chemicals, and fish consumption
education programs. 4. Rigorously evaluate engagement activities, processes, and outcomes, and
disseminate best practices at regional and national levels."
10765405,"Project Summary
For 30 years now, our laboratory has used live cell imaging with fluorescently marked proteins,
and classical and molecular genetic approaches with the early embryo of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate cytoskeletal function and regulation. In addition to having
isolated temperature-sensitive mutations in many essential genes that control cytoskeletal
function, bypassing earlier requirements, we have more recently incorporated extensive use of
CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly generate fluorescent protein fusions to endogenous loci, and to
degron-tag genes required for cytoskeletal function such that we can bypass earlier
requirements with auxin treatment. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 and degron-tagging, along with
gene replacement strategies that benefit from CRISPR/Cas9 technology, now enable still more
powerful investigation of gene function in vivo using this model system. Our research program
over the next five years will focus on oocyte meiotic cell division in C. elegans, which provides a
powerful platform for investigating acentrosomal spindle assembly and the regulation and
function of an animal cell cortex, with relevance to cancer, human fertility, and tissue
engineering. The power of C. elegans genetics, and its amenability to live cell imaging, together
with ongoing advances in high resolution light microscopy and our proposed novel and exciting
application of Atomic Force Microscopy, make C. elegans an exceptional model system for
investigation of these essential processes."
10767249,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Heart failure is a debilitating disease. A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation plays an
important role in the development and progression of this disease. However, the development of
immunomodulatory based treatments for heart failure has, so far, been mostly unsuccessful.
 The PI recently described a population of circulating B cells that adheres to the myocardial endothelium
and found that B cell deficient animals have alterations in cardiac structure and function. Moreover, he found
that, in rodents, small molecule-mediated modulation of myocardial B cells improves cardiac function after heart
attacks. These findings, together with emerging evidence from other research groups, suggest that B cells might
be a powerful target for the development of immunomodulatory therapies to prevent and treat cardiac
dysfunction. However, our current understanding of myocardial B cell biology is critically lacking.
 Heart damage triggers a local and systemic inflammatory response characterized by recruitment of
inflammatory cells to the injured heart and rapid changes in the spleen. Currently, it is unclear if and how B cells
are recruited into the injured myocardium. Moreover, even though B cells account for about half of all the cells
in the spleen, and splenic inflammatory changes induced by heart damage have been shown to play a critical
role in the progression of heart failure, it is unclear if B cells play a role in the splenic immune response triggered
by heart damage. In addition, it remains unknown whether B cell mediated antigen presentation (that together
with antibody production and cytokine secretion is one of the 3 prototypical functions of B cells) plays any role
within the inflammatory response triggered by cardiac injury. Finally, at an even more basic level, it is unknown
how B cells adhere to the endothelium of the uninjured heart. Here, the PI proposes to fill these gaps in
knowledge by testing the hypothesis that circulating B cells bind to the myocardial endothelium through specific
adhesion molecules and, in response to myocardial injury, enter the myocardium through a CXCL13-CCR5
dependent process, are activated and proliferate in an antigen independent manner, and recirculate between
the heart and the spleen to amplify the inflammatory reaction elicited by cardiac damage via MHC-II mediated
antigen presentation. The long-term goal of the PI is to use the knowledge gained to facilitate the development
of B cell-targeted therapies for heart failure.
 The PI has been a pioneer in the study of the interaction between B cells and the heart. He is a junior
investigator, but he has mastered all the techniques needed to test this hypothesis, he is supported by several
seasoned scientists that are co-investigators or collaborators in this proposal, and works within a highly
collaborative research environment focused on excellence and innovation. He, therefore, is aptly qualified to
effectively test this innovative hypothesis and address, within the timeline of this proposal, the critical knowledge
gaps described."
10767253,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The metabolism of nutrients has been studied using unfractionated tissues, or in vitro. An unresolved question
is how nutrients are metabolized by stem cells in vivo. Our understanding of stem cell metabolism has been
limited by the fact that metabolomics typically requires millions of cells, while stem cells are rare. We
developed methods to profile the metabolome and to trace stable isotope labeled nutrients in hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) and other rare cell types purified from tissues. We found that T cell progenitors in the
thymus are glucose avid as compared to HSCs, myeloid and B cell restricted progenitors, in contrast to the
prevailing view that HSCs are more glycolytic than hematopoietic progenitors. Stable isotope tracing
experiments showed that in the bone marrow but not the thymus, glycolysis and the TCA cycle are
disconnected. Hematopoietic loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the gatekeeper enzyme that connects
glycolysis to the TCA cycle, reduced the number of double positive (DP) T cell progenitors but did not affect
HSCs or other hematopoietic cell types. Loss of PDH paradoxically did not impair the TCA cycle in the thymus,
but caused accumulation of pyruvate and aberrant redox balance. Cells which do not oxidize glucose in the
TCA cycle are classically thought to ferment glucose through glycolysis to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH). Hematopoietic loss of LDHA, one of the two LDH isoforms, impaired development of erythroid
progenitors but not HSCs, T cell progenitors or other restricted hematopoietic progenitors. The cell type
specificity in the requirement of LDH and PDH in the hematopoietic system raises the question of why different
stem or progenitor cell types choose to use LDH-mediated fermentation or PDH-mediated oxidation in vivo.
This application’s objective is to systematically dissect the role of glycolytic as compared to oxidative
metabolism in HSCs and restricted progenitors. Our hypothesis is that T cell progenitors require oxidation of
glucose via PDH to regulate pyruvate levels and redox homeostasis, in contrast to HSCs, myeloid and B cell
progenitors which are metabolically flexible. In Aim 1 we will test the metabolic mechanisms which mediate the
effects of PDH on DP cells. In Aim 2 we will determine the cellular and metabolic effects of blocking LDHA/B or
PDH alone or in combination in HSCs and restricted progenitors. In Aim 3 we will investigate the role of
LDHA/B and PDH in hematopoietic and thymopoietic regeneration. These experiments will identify the
contribution of glucose to metabolite pools in HSCs and progenitors in vivo, systematically test the idea that
HSCs are glycolytic, and identify mechanisms by which central carbon metabolism regulates hematopoietic
differentiation and regeneration. More generally our experiments will address a fundamental metabolic
question by testing if stem or progenitor cells in vivo switch between glucose fermentation or oxidation, as is
the textbook view, or if some cell types in vivo tolerate the loss of both major glucose catabolic pathways."
10783043,"Project Summary
 Pancreatic islets of Langerhans are functional micro-organs that are essential for glucose homeostasis.
Loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing beta-cells in islets results in dysregulation of blood glucose levels and
leads to diabetes. An important goal in diabetes prevention and treatment is a better understanding of the
pathways governing expansion of beta-cell mass and function. Pancreatic islets do not exist in isolation, and an
area of emerging importance is the role of innervation in islet development and functions in health and disease.
Pancreatic islets are densely innervated by sympathetic nerves, as well as by parasympathetic nerves, although
to a lesser extent. Neuronal input is necessary to control hormone release in adult islets and maintain glucose
homeostasis. Previously, our laboratory showed that sympathetic innervation of islets during development is
essential for establishing islet architecture and for functional maturation in mice. Recent findings indicate that
islet innervation undergoes substantial structural changes in animal models of diabetes and in human tissues.
Together, these studies highlight a critical need to investigate the contribution of innervation to islet morphology
and hormone secretion in physiological and pathological conditions.
 Pregnancy is a unique physiological condition when islets show striking morphological and functional
plasticity in adult life. In response to increased metabolic demand, adult beta-cells dynamically respond by
enhancing proliferation and their secretory function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
structural and functional plasticity of islets during pregnancy remain largely unclear. Based on my preliminary
results, the overall goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that innervation contributes to islet plasticity during
pregnancy. I will test this hypothesis by defining anatomical and functional interactions between autonomic
nerves and the endocrine pancreas using whole-mount immunostaining, 3D imaging, and nerve ablation studies
in pregnant and control mice. Whole-organ imaging will preserve the spatial relationships between endocrine
islets and neighboring nerves. By performing genetic ablation of islet nerves, I will address the essential
contribution of nerves to adaptive changes in islet structure and function in pregnant mice.
 Through this fellowship application, I will define a new regulatory pathway, specifically, the role of
peripheral nerves, in islet and beta-cell adaptation during a condition of high metabolic demand. I will also
develop the experimental, communication, and leadership skills necessary to accomplish my goal of becoming
an independent investigator. My training will be facilitated by the rigorous research plan, the expertise and
guidance of my mentor and thesis committee, and the outstanding training resources and facilities available
through Johns Hopkins University."
10783049,"The nation’s grim opioid crisis surges on, with the fentanyls (high potency synthetic opioids) driving
unprecedented mortality rates. Drug overdose deaths are now the leading cause of death in those under age
50, with more than 47,000 Americans dying of opioid overdose in 2017. As of December 2018, Philadelphia
had the third highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the country (out-ranked only by Pittsburgh and Baltimore).
Fentanyl is present in 84% of the fatal opioid overdoses in Philadelphia. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
for opioid use disorders – whether full opioid agonist (methadone), partial opioid agonist (buprenorphine), or a
full antagonist (naltrexone) – is critical for reducing opioid use, and for preventing overdose deaths.
Unfortunately, compliance with these life-saving medications is often poor, with ancillary use of non-opioid drugs
(especially cocaine) as a common culprit. Cocaine is found in almost half of the opioid overdose deaths in
Philadelphia.
 Identifying promising adjunctive medications that reduce cocaine and other illicit drug use during MAT
could improve adherence and save thousands of lives each year. Further, measuring how these medications
“engage” the intended brain targets will speed rational medication development. Toward both these goals, we
will cohere significant local addiction resources and research strengths (e.g., in clinical trials and human
neuroimaging) to establish a Clinical Laboratory with Integrated Neuroscience (CLIN) for Evaluation of
Medications for Substance Use Disorders at the University of Pennsylvania Center for Studies of Addiction. The
initial 2-year demonstration project in the UG1 will test the promise of cariprazine, a candidate anti-relapse
medication with high D3-affinity, both for preliminary clinical efficacy (reduced illicit drug use, and improved
adherence to life-saving naltrexone), and for target engagement (e.g., blunting of drug cue-triggered limbic
activation) in patients with opioid use disorders. The project will recruit detoxified opioid patients (up to n=75)
within a proximal network of 10 clinical treatment sites. Eligible patients will be randomly-assigned (2:1 ratio) to
cariprazine (Vraylar, 1.5 mg daily) vs. placebo, and all will receive up to 3 monthly injections of extended release
injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol, 380 mg) in a 12 week outpatient trial (Early Efficacy). A subgroup of imaging-
eligible patients will also receive inpatient Target Engagement measures (brain imaging probes for reward and
inhibition) prior to beginning the outpatient trial. We will also examine (Exploratory Aim) the impact of
hypothesis- driven genetic polymorphisms (e.g., rs6280 for DA D3 receptor) on both the brain and clinical
response to the D3 medication. Summary: The highly experienced CLIN team, innovative brain tools, and the
novel testing of a D3 medication to improve adherence to naltrexone, are clear strengths of the initial
demonstration project, and increase the likelihood that it will both provide new knowledge and save lives. Out-
years CLIN strengths include the promise of new candidate medications (e.g., GABA B PAMs, orexin
antagonists, cannabidiol) and new, highly-selective PET tracers for measuring opioid receptors and medication
occupancy."
10783054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Complex decision-making often encompasses both cognitive and affective components. Cognitive and
affective processes engage distinct but interacting systems in the brain, and both systems are effected by stress,
a prevalent problem in modern society and a well-known risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Human brain
imaging studies suggest a network of brain regions as the potential interface between cognitive and affective
processing, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the anterior insular cortex (aIC), and midbrain
dopamine (DA) regions such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, these studies lack causality tests at
the neural circuit level. Comparative neuroanatomy and developmental genetics have identified in mice
evolutionarily related mPFC, aIC, and DA regions. The structure and function of these regions are also disturbed
by stress. These findings open the venue to use mouse as a model species for causal studies of the fundamental
functions of these brain regions with precise circuit manipulation tools. Our overall goal is to elucidate the
fronto-insular circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive-affective interactions during decision-making
and the impact of stress on such mechanisms in mice. Our proposal is based on published literature and
preliminary data showing: 1) mPFC, aIC and VTA are engaged in cognitive and affective decision-making; 2)
mPFC and aIC are directly connected and both receive DA inputs from VTA; 3) stress affects mPFC and aIC
neurons as well as DA release in these areas; 4) DA modulates mPFC and aIC activity and decision-making. By
combining projection-specific viral labeling of neural circuits with in vivo imaging/electrophysiology and
optogenetic/pharmacogenetic manipulations, we will test the central hypothesis that mPFC-aIC interaction is
crucial for decision-making, which is disrupted by chronic stress but rescuable via DA modulation.
Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the function of mPFC-aIC connections during decision-making in the
attentional set-shifting test. In Aim 2, we will examine how stress affects mPFC-aIC connectivity and function. In
Aim 3, we will define impact of stress on DA modulation of mPFC and aIC function, and explore the possibility
to rescuing decision-making by selectively restore DA modulation in mPFC or aIC in stressed mice. The
successful outcomes of this project will not only provide fundamental knowledge about the circuit mechanisms
underlying higher brain functions, but also point out potential therapeutic targets for alleviating the detrimental
effects of stress and psychiatric illnesses."
10783055,"Project Summary. This K99/R00 proposal concerns the structure, function, and regulation of key proteins
involved in cell signaling, PTEN and USP7. PTEN is a tumor suppressor lipid phosphatase that catalyzes the
removal of the 3'-phosphate from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)
to generate PIP2. Since PIP3 is a key regulator of cell growth and insulin signaling, it is imperative that PTEN
activity be tightly controlled. Loss of function PTEN mutations are frequently observed in cancer. PTEN is
post-translationally regulated by N-terminal ubiquitination and C-terminal phosphorylation but the detailed
structural and mechanistic impacts of these post-translational modifications (PTMs) are not well understood.
USP7 is a Cys hydrolase that is a deubiquitinase (DUB), catalyzing the cleavage of the ubiquitin/lysine
isopeptide bond. USP7's ubiquitinated protein substrates include PTEN and MDM2. Deubiquitination of PTEN
is reported to inhibit its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Moreover, USP7 has been shown to
enhance the cellular stability of MDM2, and this is important because MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for major
tumor suppressor protein p53. It is unclear what molecular features drive USP7's substrate selectively and
how it is regulated in the cell. USP7 is modified on both its N- and C-termini by phosphorylation and
acetylation but the regulatory roles of these PTMs are unclear. Here, we will address how PTEN and USP7
are regulated by PTMs using new and emerging semi-synthetic approaches. These semi-synthetic methods
can facilitate site-specific and stoichiometric installation of PTMs and their mimics into PTEN and USP7. Aim
1 seeks to define the molecular basis for PTEN regulation by C-terminal tail phosphorylation using structural
approaches. Conformational closure of PTEN is driven by phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail at positions
380, 382, 383, and 385 resulting in an inhibited enzyme, reduced plasma membrane binding, and increased
stability. This aim employs biomolecular NMR, crystallography, and mutagenesis to understand the structural
and mechanistic basis for conformational closure. Aim 2 will employ a series of biochemical and cellular
methods to define the function of Lys13 monoubiquitination, enhancing our understanding of how this PTM
may promote the shuttling of PTEN from the cytosol to the nucleus. Aim 3 will address what molecular
features drive USP7’s substrate selectivity and how USP7 PTMs (Ser18, Tyr1091, Thr1092, and Tyr1093
phosphorylation; Lys1096 acetylation and ubiquitination) regulate its function. Overall, these proposed studies
can greatly enhance our understanding of the function and regulation of PTEN and USP7 which can spotlight
possible targets for therapy. In addition, this proposal can also increase the PI's breadth of scientific skills and
experiences as he seeks to chart a course for an independent academic career."

Human heart development represents an ideal model system for understanding 1) how normal development can
produce all the cell types necessary for cardiac function and 2) how genetic variation can perturb this process
and lead to disease. We will generate large-scale single cell data sets that will enable the development of
accurate computational models capable of predicting the effects of both genetic changes to regulatory elements
(REs) and perturbations to trans-acting regulatory factors on gene expression during the complex developmental
process of human heart development. We will study a medically relevant, human, in vitro, temporally dynamic,
3D cardiac organoid differentiation system that faithfully recapitulates fetal differentiation patterns for
differentiation towards various cell types, including cardiomyocyte, neural crest, and cardiac endothelium. For
each of these differentiation trajectories, we will work in distinct aims toward mapping, perturbing, modeling,
and model validation: Mapping: we will generate systematic, single cell multi-omic (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and
protein quantification) and bulk data to map REs, chromatin contacts, RNA polymerase, and gene expression
through differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to heart tissue. Perturbing: We will use CRISPR-
based methods to comprehensively perturb transcription factors (TFs) required for the different differentiation
trajectories, and map the single-cell gene regulatory and expression impact of perturbing these factors at multiple
time points across these differentiation. Modeling: We will develop multi-input, nucleotide-resolved neural
networks to learn dynamic gene regulatory networks using these mapping and perturbation data sets. These
models will aim to understand the changing landscape of regulation and grammars of TF motifs over
differentiation time and will predict both chromatin and gene expression effects expected from genetic
perturbations. Model validation: We will apply our network models to identify, investigate, and experimentally
test perturbations relevant to understanding disease variation, by knocking down TFs, perturbing REs, and
editing disease-associated noncoding variants. Finally, we will extract and test molecular properties of TF
function from validated models. Successful completion of our project will provide mechanistic interpretations for
how genetic variants may impact development (by disrupting REs that in turn disrupt gene expression) in human
heart development. Our Stanford team comprises a diverse collection of investigators with a history of
collaboration and work in consortia, with expertise in genomics methods development (Greenleaf, Engreitz,
Bassik), single cell methods and analysis (Greenleaf), heart development and disease genetics (Gifford,
Quertermous), and deep learning for genomic data sets (Kundaje). This project will produce gold-standard data
defining the trans-acting factor network driving heart development, and a model capturing these complex
dynamics capable of quantitatively linking changes in genotype to effects phenotype relevant to human disease."
10780235,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects 10-15% of U.S. adults, costs over $37 billion annually,
and causes serious symptoms, physical impairment and high hospital admission and mortality rates. Much of its
burden can be reduced by following guideline recommended self-care activities, like daily use of disease
controlling medications and pulmonary rehabilitation. Yet patients often struggle with the self-care needed to
maintain or improve their health. The potential barriers to successful self-care are numerous, encompassing
socioeconomic, psychosocial, physical, cognitive and other domains. Moreover, many of the barriers are major
contributors to health inequities, as reflected in poorer access to COPD treatments and poorer outcomes among
racial and ethnic minority patients. Most COPD self-management support interventions have largely followed
one-size-fits-all strategies of education and training. We created the Supporting self-Management Behaviors for
aging Adults (SaMBA)-COPD intervention based on the successful SaMBA program for older adults with asthma.
The model is unique among chronic illness self-management programs because it involves comprehensive
screening for barriers to self-management and disease control and couples it with tailored, theory-based, barrier-
specific interventions. The intervention is delivered by community health workers and includes steroid and
antibiotic prescribing for early intervention of COPD exacerbations and home-based pulmonary rehabilitation
(HBPR). Our feasibility trial of SaMBA-COPD, conducted with a predominantly Black and Latinx population, met
most of the benchmarks for success, including complete preparation of all intervention and study related
materials and protocols, intervention fidelity and patient acceptability, and outcomes that suggest the intervention
will improve self-management behaviors and reduce COPD symptoms. We now propose a fully powered
randomized trial among inner-city adults with COPD (n=300). The Specific Aims are to test the impact of SaMBA-
COPD on (1) COPD controller medication adherence and other self-management behaviors at 6 months; (2) on
clinical outcomes (COPD symptoms measured with the COPD Assessment Test and 6-minute walk test
distance) at 6 months, and emergency department visits and hospitalizations at 12 months; and (3) to examine
mechanisms of intervention effect on medication adherence and clinical outcomes, with a focus on the role of
COPD illness and medication beliefs. We will recruit adults ages 40 years and older with advanced COPD in
outpatient practices in New York City. The intervention will be delivered for 6 months. Attention control patients
will receive untailored COPD education. Sustainability of treatment effects will be evaluated at 12 months. The
intervention is significant and innovative for its comprehensive pre-trial preparation, attention to the full range of
contributors to suboptimal self-management and COPD control, the broadening of community health workers'
scope of practice to include HBPR, and the project's focus on achieving equity in healthcare and health outcomes
for Black and Latinx COPD patients."

This Phase I COBRE would create the Oklahoma Center for Microbiome Research (OCMR). The proposed
Center of Excellence will foster the careers of up-and-coming scientists in the microbiome field. The goal is to
create the intellectual environment necessary to support five Research Project Leaders in Microbiome
Research by installing a mentoring system and building research infrastructure. The OCMR is innovative
because it would be one of only three microbiome-focused COBRE grants awarded nationwide and the first to
create infrastructure for cutting-edge anaerobic microbiology services. The Anaerobic Core will be the first
facility in Oklahoma to provide customized culturomics services, which is imperative not only for this COBRE
but the wider Oklahoma research community. Enhanced anaerobic microbiology infrastructure is critical for the
success of the proposed Research Projects. The Center of Excellence is significant because it is one of four
strategic research initiatives prioritized for sustained support by Oklahoma State University’s Division of the
Vice President for Research. As such, the OSU administration has made substantial institutional commitments
to this Phase I COBRE application. Specifically, these investments include new faculty lines, startup packages,
research space, support for pilot projects, and a new Anaerobic Microbiology Research Core. The Projects
associated with the OCMR will generate new knowledge of microbiome structure and function to lay the
foundation for treatments to maintain and restore microbiome health. The OCMR will be located at Oklahoma
State University, a Carnegie Research 1 institution and the state’s land grant university, in primary partnership
with the OSU Center for Health Sciences, an academic health center that includes the College of Osteopathic
Medicine in Tulsa, and the COM Cherokee Nation in Tahlequah, OK. The PI/Director of the OCMR will be Dr.
Tyrrell Conway who brings over three decades of experience mentoring students, postdocs, staff, and faculty;
leading large research projects to study microbiome functions; and administering a large academic
department. This Center of Excellence will initially have 20 scientists as key personnel, including five promising
Research Project Leaders and several well-established microbiome researchers to serve as Mentors and Core
Director. The OCMR will provide funding, Research Core support, and mentoring to Research Project Leaders
to facilitate their independence, i.e., R01 status. The proposed Center of Excellence will be created by
executing four specific aims: 1) Recruit and support five Research Project Leaders to scientific independence;
2) Create a thematic Center to mentor Research Project Leaders and promote multidisciplinary research
centered around microbiome science; 3) Establish a new Research Core for Anaerobic Microbiology to boost
innovative and collaborative microbiome science, enhance anaerobic culturomics capacities, and share
experimental approaches; and 4) Support an environment of intellectual collaboration through activities that
allow frequent interactions and develop a sustainable Center of Excellence focused on Microbiome Research."
10771557,"This Phase I CoBRE will create the Oklahoma Center for Microbiome Research (OCMR) to broadly address
key principles and questions concerning microbiome structure and function as the underpinnings of human
health and disease. Effective research requires strong administrative support and ancillary services. Thus, the
long-term goal is to transform the OCMR into an independent research center that supports and promotes
research excellence while facilitating early-stage investigators’ progress towards independence. A key to
achieving the objectives and long-term goals is the coordination of multiple research activities, career
development events and activities, interactions, mentoring, communication, networking, and reporting. The
OCMR Administrative Core will facilitate and manage these aspects of the Center. In addition to the above, the
Administrative Core will monitor the success of Research Project Leaders in achieving milestones and the
overall success of the OCMR. As such, the Administrative Core will establish and manage an Advisory
Committee to evaluate and advise the OCMR Directors and Research Project Leaders. The Administrative
Core will manage and facilitate the administration of COBRE budgets, reporting to NIH, and administering the
Pilot Project Program. The overall objective of the Administrative Core is to oversee, manage, and implement
all administrative-related activities and provide the necessary support for Research Project Leaders to succeed
and reach independent R01 status. The OCMR is well-positioned to implement the Administrative Core due to
strong leadership and management experience of the Associate Directors, Mentors with successful track
records of mentoring early-stage investigators, and institutional resources and support. The OCMR will attain
the overall objective by pursuing six Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1) Provide Administrative Management of the
Oklahoma Center for Microbiome Science Activities. Specific Aim 2) Effectively Mentor and Monitor Research
Project Leaders to Achieve Milestones Resulting in Independence. Specific Aim 3) Support Research Project
Leaders through Career Development and Guidance. Specific Aim 4) Develop a strong Pipeline of New RPLs
by Cultivating Replacement Research Project Leaders. Specific Aim 5) Establish an Effective Advisory
Committee to Oversee the COBRE. Specific Aim 6) Administer a Pilot Project Program that Supports the
Research Project Leader Pipeline."
10771558,"ABSTRACT
 Many Earth ecosystems are devoid of oxygen and are populated by strictly anaerobic microorganisms that
contribute essential functions to their microbiomes. To study these microbiomes, the Oklahoma Center for
Microbiome Research (OCMR) COBRE aims to provide cutting-edge tools to identify and cultivate strict anaerobes.
However, cultivating and characterizing anaerobes requires a highly specialized skillset of exceptional laboratory
practices. To provide these research tools an Anaerobic Microbiology Research Core will be established. The
Anaerobic Core will support all five research projects in the OCMR, which focus on the roles of anaerobes in their
respective hosts. Project 1 (Huang) will determine the genetic basis by which pathogenic anaerobes stimulate oral
cancer progression. Project 2 (Kirchberger) will characterize and manipulate host determinants of newly discovered
Microviridae that frequently dominate the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) virome by developing anaerobic model
systems. Project 3 (Lin) will investigate the interactions of dietary carotenoids and anaerobic members of the GIT,
which work together to lessen systemic inflammation. Project 4 (Stubbendieck) will identify and characterize
pathogen-specific secondary metabolites produced by commensal anaerobes of the human aerodigestive tract.
Project 5 (Vazquez Sanroman) will determine how gut anaerobes induce dysbiosis in the adolescent microbiome-
gut-brain axis during opioid abuse and withdrawal in the search for treatments to mitigate the associated debilitating
behavioral changes in these patients. The common theme of these diverse projects is the role of anaerobes and
the need to study them further. To advance the projects and enable the RPLs to transition to independent R01
funding, the Anaerobic Core will provide resources for anaerobic microbiology that support their research programs.
Therefore, the primary goal of the Anaerobic Microbiology Core will be to centralize and expand the anaerobic
culturomics resources, services, and training available to COBRE investigators to achieve their specific research
aims and long-term career goals. To meet these research goals, the OCMR Anaerobic Core will provide: 1)
Culturomics to enable high throughput culture isolation under a wide range of growth conditions and oxygen
concentrations, 2) Targeted enrichment to isolate specific microbes based on phenotypic traits, 3) Sequence-
guided culture isolation using nanobody-tags to specific organisms followed by cell sorting and targeted cultivation,
4) Culture storage and record keeping, and 5) Downstream services for culture identification and characterization,
microbial community analysis, and genomics. Achieving these specific aims will establish a Research Core for
Anaerobic Microbiology that accelerates the aforementioned research projects and the entire community of OSU
microbiome researchers."
10771559,"Project Summary
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer worldwide with an average 5-
year survival rate of only 68% and accounts for over 180,000 deaths annually. Risk factors for OSCC include
tobacco and alcohol usage, and human papillomavirus infections. Poor oral hygiene has also been correlated
with various cancers and other chronic diseases. The oral microbiome has therefore been hypothesized to play
a role in the development of these diseases. In recent years, multiple studies have clearly shown a significant
difference in the oral microbiome composition of OSCC patients versus non-OSCC individuals. However, only
two oral pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have been shown to have
direct effect on OSCC development, while little is known about whether other members of the oral microbiome
also contribute to cancer progression. Recently, we discovered that Prevotella intermedia, another well-known
periodontal pathogen previously found to have higher abundance in oral cavity of OSCC patients, also
contribute to cancer progression. We showed that certain P. intermedia isolates enhanced the proliferation and
migration of multiple human OSCC cell lines in part by the secretion of the cysteine proteinase Interpain A
(InpA). We further revealed that InpA might enhance OSCC proliferation and migration by interacting with the
human protease-activators receptor 2 (PAR2), a known oncoprotein. To test the hypothesis that P. intermedia
is a novel oncobacterium, we aim to identify the mechanism by which P. intermedia stimulates OSCC
progression. In addition to confirm the role of InpA and PAR2 in P. intermedia-stimulated OSCC progression,
we will perform transcriptomic studies to reveal the full extent of P. intermedia’s effect on OSCC gene
expression. Identification of P. intermedia genes associated with OSCC progression will be achieved by the
establishment of a high-throughput assay to screen for P. intermedia transposon mutants deficient in their
ability to enhance cell proliferation and migration. In the second aim, we will determine if polymicrobial
interaction plays a role in P. intermedia-stimulated carcinogenesis by in vitro assays and by establishing a
murine model of oral tumorigenesis. The studies presented here will reveal for the first time that P. intermedia
contributes to OSCC progression. Equally important are the novel high-throughput screening system
developed in this study which will provide invaluable tools for other investigators to examine the role of P.
intermedia in other diseases. Finally, our study will yield clues to the mechanisms behind oral microbiota
facilitated OSCC development."
10771560,"Engineering host-determinants of novel gut Microviruses
PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-phiX-like Microviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses that are numerous, diverse, and poorly
understood members of the human gut virome. Their simple genetic structure makes them amendable to
manipulation of their host specificity, while their small size enables phage production via de novo synthesis of
their genomes from in-silico data, followed by transformation of virus-generating DNA in the host. The
Research Project Leader (RPL) has previously established a strong research program to study these elusive
phages. Through investigation of their biology and ecological roles in microbiomes, he is poised to develop
microviruses as a versatile tool for the targeted manipulation of the gut microbial community towards desired
health outcomes such as staving off bacterial infections.
 Several obstacles must be overcome before practical applications of his research can be explored through
R01 grant funding. The patterns and determinants of microviral host identity and specificity need to be
understood, and the feasibility of re-introducing engineered phages into mixed microbial populations needs to
be demonstrated. This proposal addresses these issues through three scientific aims: 1) Identifying natural
hosts and establishing virus-host systems for major microvirus lineages of the human gut, 2) Establishing a
system for targeted modulation of Microviridae host range, and 3) Re-introducing phages into controlled
microbiomes for precise manipulation of microbial community composition.
 Success in these endeavors requires extensive experience in culturing and manipulating not only
microviruses (the RPL’s expertise), but also with anaerobic hosts such as Bacteroides and Prevotella. Through
the Oklahoma Center for Microbiome Research (OCMR) Anaerobic Microbiology Core and COBRE-facilitated
mentorship by experts in virology, metagenomics, and biology of human gut microbes, as well as interactions
with a wide range of researchers in the microbiome field, the RPL will have access to the technical
infrastructure, intellectual expertise, and professional network needed to pursue these aims. The project is
hence crucial to the RPL’s short and long-term career goals of attaining research independence in the form of
an R01/R35 grant; establishing his laboratory as a leading institution in the research of microviruses; and
developing microviruses as modular tools for a fully synthetic phage therapy platform."
10746406,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Young adolescents (ages 10-15) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk for deterioration of glycemic control
and relatedly poor overall T1D self-management. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) provide real-time
indicators of glucose levels and alert users to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Consistent, informed use of
CGM has the potential to improve glycemic control and related T1D health outcomes. However, adolescents
with T1D are the least likely age group to utilize CGM and significant health disparities exist in access to and
use of CGM among youth from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and youth with public insurance.
Adolescent CGM users also continue to evidence A1c levels above recommended targets, potentially due
challenges related to perceived CGM burden and related family functioning. Novel, developmentally targeted
interventions delivered early in adolescence could promote optimal uptake and use of CGM and reduce
psychosocial barriers to sustained use but must be evaluated in rigorous pilot trials that attend to health
disparities. The current study proposes to evaluate an innovative behavioral intervention that utilizes certified
diabetes care and education specialists (CDCES) to teach problem-solving and communication skills around
CGM data and use, targeting adolescent-parent T1D interactions related to glucose data, individualized CGM
challenges, and weekly adolescent-parent joint review of CGM reports. The intervention also addresses HCP
knowledge of health disparities in diabetes technology through interactive education, and boosts family support
through connection with peer parent consultants. This study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the
behavioral intervention to enhance CGM use and resulting T1D health outcomes. Sixty adolescents and their
parents will be recruited for this pilot randomized trial, randomly assigned to either an immediate intervention
group or a delayed intervention group serving as a standard care comparison. Intervention content will be
delivered via 3 telemedicine sessions with adolescents and a parent and supported by connection with a peer
parent consultant. Medical and psychosocial data (including A1c, CGM indicators, CGM burdens and benefits,
diabetes distress, and diabetes-related family conflict) will be collected from adolescents and a parent at
baseline and three follow-up time points across the first year after CGM initiation. We will employ quantitative
and qualitative analyses to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability, and impact. Enhancing CGM access
and use at this key developmental juncture provides an excellent opportunity for tailored support and problem-
solving, resulting in potentially lasting improvement in diabetes self-management. Results of this pilot trial will
directly inform a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy, with the long term goal of identifying
effective behavioral strategies that can be integrated into routine diabetes education and care."
10746407,"Project Summary
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new
patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation
therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging
performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months.
Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging
to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly
important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease
through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems
attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized
language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such
framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of
follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing
interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.
 This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective
interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional,
representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation
tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database
of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop
computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT-
RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment
surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would
have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel
therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are
superior to conventional measurements alone.
 A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for
clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house
the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high
performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in
developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and
evaluation of novel therapies in research settings."
10746408,"Abstract
Our central goal is to create a volumetric real-time system combining ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA)
tomography (USPAT) for high resolution structural and functional imaging. The recent development of high
channel count ultrafast US systems creates the opportunity to capture volumes at a high frame rate.
Tomography, defined as a technique for displaying a representation of a cross section through a human body,
facilitates high resolution (lamba/2) imaging by effectively rotating the US point spread function to reduce the
effect of diffraction. We have developed an ultrafast US capability mated to a tomographic ring of transducers
and scanned in depth by motorized acquisition. Leveraging the ultrafast capability provides the opportunity for
acquisition of volumetric, functional breast images within 1 minute. The acquisition is controlled by 1024 coherent
channels of Verasonics imaging systems (to be increased to 2048) and includes embedded GPUs for real-time
imaging and analysis. When operated at 5 MHz, the resulting spatial resolution is nearly isotropic in plane with
resolution of ~ half a wavelength (in this case ~150 microns). Compared to US images acquired with
conventional imaging, the image quality is far improved. Ultrasound methods are attractive for integration into
breast management due to their utility in guiding biopsy and the very high
sensitivity (97.3%) that can be achieve
by combining ultrasound with conventional screening.
Both transmission and reflection tomography modes will
be evaluated in order to facilitate both high resolution reflective modes and highly quantitative transmission
imaging. PA imaging (PAI) is particularly well suited to complement US and improve diagnostic imaging of the
breast. Our immediate goal is to reduce the number of biopsies required in women undergoing breast screening.
Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) enhances the signal to noise ratio and visualization of morphology over
conventional PAI. Healthy breast tissue has low optical absorption and US scattering, allowing for highly efficient
PAT. Since abnormally increased vasculature and hemoglobin at tumor sites produces strong intrinsic
photoacoustic contrast, PAT is ideally suited for visualizing angiogenesis. Further, PAT can assess the relative
oxygenation of a region. With our combined strategy, we will evaluate characterization algorithms based on
each feature – blood flow, oxygenation and structural changes, assessing the sensitivity of individual and
combined imaging features. With a first study of this technique in a mouse model of premalignant to malignant
transformation and a human study of lesion characterization, we will determine whether USPAT can add to the
sensitivity and specificity of lesion characterization by MRI. Our resulting specific aims are to: 1) implement and
integrate blood mapping, US tomography, and PAT for breast imaging, 2) assess the sensitivity and specificity
of the resulting system in a rodent model of breast cancer, and 3) apply these new capabilities to image patients
with MRI detected abnormalities recommended for biopsy."
10746409,"Project Summary
 Multi-drug resistant infections are a major threat to global health and resistance has been observed for
every clinically-used antibiotic, even those considered to be the last lines of treatment. Further compounding
the antimicrobial resistance crisis is the lack of new antibiotics entering the pipeline, particularly for Gram-
negative pathogens which have an impermeable outer membrane, limiting small molecule accumulation, and
promiscuous efflux pumps, which can recognize and expel most small molecules from the cell. A basic-science
understanding of favorable chemical properties required to enhance compound accumulation and decrease
efflux propensity is needed to develop antibacterial candidates with whole-cell activity against Gram-negative
pathogens. Initial efforts in the Hergenrother lab have identified the physicochemical traits needed for
compound permeation in E. coli and successfully applied these guidelines to convert several Gram-positive
only antibiotics to broad-spectrum agents. While this strategy improves Gram-negative antibacterial activity,
compound efflux is still detrimental to efficacy and prevents development of these leads into potent antibiotics.
It is imperative to understand the physicochemical properties governing compound recognition and efflux to
provide a novel design platform to engineer efflux susceptibility out of drug candidates. The objective of this
proposal is to identify the parameters that define compound efflux in Gram-negative bacteria and apply these
findings to remove efflux liability out of promising antibacterial candidates.
 Work proposed herein will build upon preliminary studies of the efflux propensity of ~200 compounds
utilizing a novel LC-MS/MS-based accumulation (Efflux Propensity EvaLuation (EXPEL)) assay which can
detect small changes in efflux susceptibilities irrespective of antibacterial activity and a chemoinformatic model
which can accurately classify 50% of compounds as efflux substrates and non-substrates. In Specific Aim 1,
additional physicochemical properties determined important for compound efflux by the random forest model
will be probed through synthesis of a targeted library of side-by-side comparisons. These compounds will be
added to the dataset and iterative cycles of compound synthesis, EXPEL assay, and chemoinformatic model
validation will be performed. Utilizing the EXPEL assay and the initial properties identified as correlating to
efflux ratios, derivatives of an exciting FabI inhibitor will be explored to identify promising antibacterials with
decreased efflux liabilities in Specific Aim 2. The therapeutic potential of these compounds will be explored
through toxicity studies, determination of pharmacokinetic profile, and evaluation of efficacy in mouse infection
models. Specific Aims 1 and 2 will run concurrently and completion of these studies will significantly impact
antibacterial research and remedy attrition points in the antibacterial clinical pipeline."

ECHO AWARE (ECHO in Agricultural Washington and Rural Environments) enriches the ECHO Program in
two primary ways. 1) We will increase representation of rural and agricultural communities, particularly Latino
families, in the ECHO Cohort. Rural children experience many health and environmental exposure disparities,
yet are poorly represented in research and in the current ECHO Cohort. With deep community-engaged
research ties to Washington’s agricultural Yakima Valley, our team is poised to enroll over 1000 pregnant
individuals through partnership with their medical home and Federally Qualified Health Center (Yakima Valley
Farm Workers Clinic). We also partner with Heritage University to involve Latino and Yakama Nation
undergraduates and junior faculty to exchange perspectives regarding ECHO research practice and foster
biomedical career development in this environmental justice community. Biospecimen collection will be led by
a subteam with experience directing a biorepository for >10,000 pregnancies. 2) Our investigator team (diverse
in career stage, scientific discipline, institution, cultural background) advances ECHO collaborative science in
air pollution, airway health, and rural health. We propose a new cross-cohort Rural Health Workgroup plus a
series of ECHO manuscripts to understand the health conditions and risk factors for under-resourced and
minoritized communities in rural America, as well as best practices for engaging these hard-to-reach
populations. A set of novel preconception analyses addresses widespread contaminants of concern for
drinking water wells, an underdeveloped topic for ECHO. We also leverage decades of air pollution expertise
to expand the air pollution exposures available for ECHO analyses and conduct solution-oriented research to
directly inform U.S. regulatory policy and public health promotion programs. Our team contributes expertise in
advanced methods for air pollution, including those for exposure mixtures. We also bring new national models
for outdoor air pollutants of emerging concern to ECHO, including wildfire smoke (WFS) and ultrafine
particulate matter (UFP). We first develop an improved national model for WFS to enable much-needed
research on this climate-change driven catastrophe and lead manuscripts to describe impacts on US children.
We then develop a new national model of UFP, an unregulated pollutant demonstrating high toxic potential in
animal models yet with little epidemiological data. We also propose brief, low-burden extensions to the ECHO
Protocol to better characterize rural chemical exposures as well as knowledge of the Air Quality Index (AQI) to
explore disparities in access to this public health tool and evaluate its effectiveness in mitigating health effects.
A proposed Wildfire Rapid Response Protocol will support natural experiment analyses of wildfire related
health crises. Overall, ECHO AWARE builds on prior successes and insights gained as the ECHO
PATHWAYS multi-cohort award center point for project coordination and team science; we continue these
efforts in ECHO 2.0 with a focus on solution-oriented research, community-engagement, and translation."
10773162,"Purpose: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and in 2006 the cost of treating
hyponatremia in the US was estimated to be $1.6-$3.6 billion per year. Inappropriate vasopressin
secretion is the major cause of dilutional hyponatremia associated with liver and heart failure. Our
previous studies have also shown that, in male BDL rats, BDNF-TrkB signaling in the SON
contributes sustained AVP and copeptin (a clinical surrogate for AVP 1-3) release, and
hyponatremia 4. However, little is known about the role of sex differences in hyponatremia5. Our
data show that female BDL rats do not develop hyponatremia or increased AVP release6. Instead
female BDL rats show increased release of oxytocin6 . Our findings also suggest that the effects
of BDL on neurohypophyseal hormones may be sexually dimorphic. Our central hypothesis is
that ER in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) contribute, at least in part, to sex
differences seen in the BDL model of dilutional hyponatremia.
Our hypotheses will be tested with the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1 will define the contributions of estrogen receptors in hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal
neurons to sex differences in a model of dilutional hyponatremia
Aim 2 will determine differences in SON gene expression that may contribute to underlying sex
differences in AVP release in a model of dilutional hyponatremia
Benefit: These experiments will address an existing gap in our understanding of
neurophypophyseal function and the pathogenesis of hyponatremia. The findings of these
experiments could potentially alter the way that inappropriate vasopressin release is studied and
conceptualized clinically."
10773166,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Circadian clocks shift later (delay) with the progression of puberty; this shift contributes to late sleep onsets in
older adolescents. Early school start times, however, force teenagers awake earlier than their spontaneous
wake time and the opportunity for sleep shortens. Indeed, a majority of adolescents in the U.S. are chronically
sleep deprived, getting 1- 2 h less sleep than recommended. Also, many adolescents wake for school at the
“wrong” circadian time. Chronic circadian misalignment and sleep restriction are at their peak during late
adolescence, and are associated with morning daytime sleepiness, poor academic performance, conduct
problems, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, substance use, and obesity. Morning bright light exposure from
light boxes can shift rhythms earlier (phase advance) to facilitate earlier sleep onset, and reduce circadian
misalignment and the associated risks. We constructed the first phase response curve (PRC) to light for
adolescents and determined that the optimal time for bright light exposure to produce phase advances was ~1
h before habitual wake and light should be avoided around the time of habitual bedtime because it causes
rhythms to shift later (delay). Studies of adults, however, indicate that restricted sleep and exposure to
evening light due to late bedtimes – two classic features of older adolescent sleep – make morning bright light
less effective in producing advances. Our pilot data in adolescents mimic this finding, but also suggest that
staying awake late in normal household lighting and the subsequent sleep restriction before and during a 3-day
morning bright light regimen, can shift the system in the wrong direction (phase delay). The overarching goal of
this proposal is to examine the DOSE of sleep restriction and evening household light that prevents the desired
phase advance to morning bright light in adolescents aged 14-17 years. Study 1 proposes to construct a sleep
restriction with normal household evening light dose-response curve to determine the point at which morning
bright light begins to lose its effectiveness. Following a baseline week with 10-h sleep opportunities,
participants will keep the same wake time but be randomly assigned to one of 4 bedtimes which will be the
same or later than baseline to produce 4 levels of sleep restriction with evening light (0, 1.5, 3, or 4.5 h). After
2 nights, we will gradually shift the sleep schedule earlier for 3 nights, and participants will receive bright light
each morning. We hypothesize that the circadian system will advance with sufficient sleep, but with increasing
sleep restriction/evening light, circadian rhythms will not shift or will delay despite the phase advancing
morning bright light. Study 2 will test whether attenuating evening light exposure by wearing sunglasses
before bedtime during sleep restriction can facilitate phase advances. Study 2 will test the same 4 “doses” of
sleep restriction. The main outcome measures to build the dose-response curves will be phase shifts of the
central circadian clock marked by the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and total sleep time measured from
wrist actigraphy in the laboratory. Secondary outcomes include cognitive performance, sleepiness, and mood."

appropriate. The latter will be greatly facilitated by the fact that both the MU Mouse Resource and Research
Center (MMRRC) and Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC) are on-site at the University of Missouri and
the members of our group are affiliated with both these repositories. Because of our extensive experience,
outstanding facilities, and equal familiarity with all aspects of working with both mice and rats, we are uniquely
suited to support the rodent in vivo testing needs not only of the Genome Editing and Biological Effects Testing

The Resource Section will also maintain breeding colonies and produce cohorts of experimental animals, and it
will be responsible for assembly and maintenance of BSL2 facilities for use by the Testing Section. The role of
the Genome Editing Testing Section will be to provide novel delivery methods and reagents for the Somatic
Cell Genome Editing community. The Genome Editing Testing Section will streamline the testing process
while maintaining a comprehensive and rigorous comparative analysis of new genome editing tools and
delivery systems. Our group is ideally suited to provide this testing due to our unique composition of individuals
that are experienced with pig production, swine biomedical models, operate successful labs that routinely test
cutting-edge genome editing technology, and are associated with world-renowned National Swine Resource
and Research Center (NSRRC) and the sunsetting Swine Somatic Cell Genome Editing Consortium Large

10913613,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nearly all science ﬁelds have been drastically changed by the big data era, and datasets have the potential to
create major breakthroughs in environmental health. However, professional development in data science lags
behind for environmental health researchers and practitioners. What training does exist primarily beneﬁts
privileged institutions. We propose the Short Course in Data Science for Environmental Public Health to
bridge this education gap. Through the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Data Science Lab, we will leverage our
combined 25-plus year track record of developing educational materials, scalable courses, scalable research
experiences, and building communities around data science education to create this multi-modal course. The
program, which will empower 30 learners annually, begins with a two-week online course that solidiﬁes R
programming foundations. These two weeks will use a combination of didactic lectures on best practices and
active hands-on lab activities to practice and engrain programming skills, a model for which the lead
instructors have earned recognition for excellence in teaching and successfully used to train over 100
professional learners. Participants will practice new skills one topic at a time to make the content more
manageable. This foundation will prepare participants for participating in a three-day in-person intensive
“Code-a-thon” where they work on authentic environmental health projects. The Code-a-thon will allow
participants to practice data ethics skills in peer code review, reproducibility, and transparency in a supportive
environment. Additionally, to ensure that we are responsive to the needs of the diverse participants, we will
allow learners a mechanism to provide anonymous feedback throughout and beyond the program. To create
scalability, we will adapt a companion Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) so that potentially thousands of
participants can beneﬁt. We will also harness the strengths of in-person instruction by creating a yearly
training for instructors hoping to reproduce this course in their own institution or community. These eﬀorts
will be bolstered by an online data community where participants can support, troubleshoot, and collaborate
with peers, as well as monthly reminder newsleęers to help participants retain what they learn. We will work
with our existing network of faculty from under-resourced institutions to recruit researchers and faculty
speciﬁcally from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges

10780199,"Proper functions of all immune systems rely on maintenance of immune homeostasis. One family of immune
cells that play key roles in immune homeostasis are regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of T cells that prevent
excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. Tregs differentiate from naïve T cells in a manner that depends on
the transcription factor FoxP3. Loss-of-function mutations in FoxP3 lead to fatal multi-organ autoimmune and
inflammatory conditions. Despite the importance, the molecular functions and mechanisms of FoxP3 remain
poorly understood. We have recently made a significant progress in our structural approach to understand the
versatile mode of DNA recognition by FoxP3. We determined the crystal structure of FoxP3 in complex with
DNA (Leng et al, Immunity, 2022), breaking the decades-old dogma that FoxP3 forms a domain-swap dimer.
More recently, we found that FoxP3 recognizes a new motif composed of TnG repeats by forming a novel
multimeric assembly and that this is accompanied by bridging of two DNA molecules (unpublished). Additional
preliminary data suggest that this mode of DNA binding also occurs in Treg cells and is important for FoxP3
functions. These findings suggest an exciting new model: unique functions of FoxP3 in Treg development is
mediated by its ability to recognize TnG repeats and to form or stabilize DNA loops. We here propose three
aims to test and further develop this model. Aim 1 is to determine the cryo-EM structure of the FoxP3
multimers in complex with TnG repeats and to validate the structural mechanism using a combination of
biochemistry and cellular immunology. Aim 2 is to investigate functional consequence of such assemblies in T
cells using genomic approaches, such as ChIP-seq and HiChIP. Aim 3 is to identify and characterize the direct
interacting partners of FoxP3 that mediate its transcriptional function, and to investigate the role of FoxP3
multimerization on its interactome.
 Together, the proposed research builds upon a strong set of exciting findings from my lab and will have a
broad impact on TFs beyond FoxP3. That is, it will help understand how TFs can utilize a multimeric scaffold to
recognize new sequence motifs and alter chromatin conformation. Additionally, TnG repeats belong to a group
of genetic elements called microsatellites, which are often thought as “junk” or pathogenic. Thus, our work also
implicates a novel role for microsatellites in transcriptional regulation and, at the same time, FoxP3 as one of
the first exemplary TFs that exploit microsatellites for their functions."
10920397,"Mobile manipulators that can navigate and physically interact with their environment have the potential to 
assist people with motor limitations in carrying out activities of daily living independently. Despite this 
great potential, robots that can be safely deployed in the homes of these users do not yet exist. Until 
recently one of the key reasons for this gap was the lack of available hardware platforms, but the release 
of Stretch – a new low-cost, light-weight, inherently safe, and highly capable mobile manipulator – has 
greatly reduced the barrier to in-home deployments. A second key reason is the difficulty of robust 
autonomy given the vast variations across home environment. A practical, near-term solution is to have 
robots teleoperated by the user, which is also preferred by users in the target group who want to keep 
control over the robot. However, most existing teleoperations interfaces are not accessible to users with 
motor limitations who might have restricted input. This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing 
new systems and algorithms that enable adaptive accessible teleoperation interfaces for mobile 
manipulators. The ability to adapt to the unique requirements and preferences of these users while 
enabling the safest and most efficient operation of the robot is critical to our proposed solution.
The project involves the development of an integrated system called AccessTeleopKit implanted on the 
Stretch robot platform, and shared as open-source software. New algorithms for automatically 
customizing interfaces in AccessTeleopKit based on user input ability assessment, and automating 
repetitive parts of common tasks from user demonstrations as they teleoperate the robot will be 
developed. Contributions also include conceptual frameworks to represent teleoperation interfaces as 
mappings between user inputs and robot control outputs with Finite State Machines; and the heuristically 
assessing the accessibility of a teleoperation interface for users with different abilities. Evaluation will 
involve user studies and multi-phase long-term deployments of the robots in five homes facilitated by 
occupational therapists and will contribute new empirical findings about the usability, utility, and 
acceptance of assistance robots in the home. New guidelines for occupational therapists to use 
teleoperated robots in their practice will also be created."

10784359,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the fastest growing form of heart failure, and is
characterized by severe exercise intolerance (EI), exertional fatigue, disability-associated reduced quality of life,
and increased mortality. The cause of the severe EI in HFpEF remains unclear, but prior reports and our
preliminary data suggest that impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism may contribute. Previously, our group
demonstrated that HFpEF patients experience a rapid decrease in skeletal muscle high energy phosphates
(HEP) during exercise, as detected with non-invasive phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS).
Other studies found that HFpEF patients have decreased skeletal muscle oxygen delivery and consumption
compared to controls. However, due to methodological limitations, it is unknown whether this is due to primary
impairments in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, or whether HFpEF patients have attenuated peripheral blood
flow that secondarily limits mitochondrial oxygen utilization. With the need for better in vivo methods to answer
this important research question, we recently developed a novel interleaved MRS/MRI tool to simultaneously
measure muscle metabolism and peripheral blood flow. Moreover, new clinically available metabolic modulators
such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes, but
their impact on muscle metabolism in HFpEF has not been studied or related to EI. Finally, conventional EI
measures during laboratory exercise testing fail to account for activities of daily living or sedentary behavior, but
these can now be measured with recent advancements in wearable health technology. However, the relationship
between these measures and skeletal muscle energetics have not been investigated in HFpEF patients.
Therefore, we will leverage our new MRS/MRI tool to test the central hypothesis that abnormalities in skeletal
muscle HEP metabolism are closely linked to manifestations of EI and fatigue in the daily lives of HFpEF patients
and can be attenuated with new metabolic modulators. The specific aims are: (1) optimize and refine our novel
interleaved MRS/MRI tool and investigate whether rapid HEP decline during exercise occurs despite preserved
blood flow in HFpEF patients, (2) explore whether metrics of activities of daily living are closely related to
conventional measures of EI and muscle metabolism in HFpEF, and (3) investigate whether SGLT2i
administration improves muscle metabolism and reduces EI in HFpEF. The combination of these three elements
will give the PI vital experience in developing clinical MRS/MRI research tools, evaluating wearable health device
data, and conducting a clinical longitudinal study that will generate crucial preliminary data for a future
randomized controlled trial using metabolic modulators. This Pathway to Independence award will be supported
by excellent career development resources at Johns Hopkins and mentorship from experts in MR, metabolism,
heart failure, wearable technology, and clinical trial design. The new tools and approaches will provide novel
insights into EI in HFpEF as well as transferable skills that the PI can leverage in his future research endeavors."
10760213,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite highly effective pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to lower blood pressure, elevated
blood pressure remains the leading global risk factor for early mortality. In Tanzanian communities, 28% of
adults aged 35 and above have hypertension, yet only 2% are aware of their diagnosis and less than 1% are
on anti-hypertensive treatment. Our long-term goal is to improve hypertension-related health outcomes in
Tanzanian communities. The overall objective of this proposal is to adapt our established model of promoting
community health interventions in partnership with highly respected religious leaders in order to bridge gaps in
rural communities’ awareness, prevention, and control of high blood pressure. Our central hypothesis is that
empowering religious leaders to engage their communities about high blood pressure will improve health
behavior and reduce the average blood pressure among adults both with and without hypertension in the
community. The rationale for our proposal is that even small reductions in community-wide blood pressure can
sharply decrease the risk of premature cardiovascular death in that community. To test this hypothesis, we will
pursue three specific aims: 1) Adapt and pilot-test our prior Religious Engagement in Health Intervention to
address blood pressure in religious contexts; 2) Determine the effectiveness of this intervention on reducing
mean community systolic blood pressure in a cluster randomized trial; and 3) Assess reach, effectiveness,
adoption, implementation, and maintenance of this intervention for 24 months. In the first aim, we will use data
from previously conducted interviews with religious leaders and community members to adapt, refine, and
pilot-test our Religious Engagement in Health Intervention to address the problem of high blood pressure using
the sequential ADAPT-ITT model. In the second aim, we will conduct a hybrid type I effectiveness-
implementation cluster randomized trial to test the hypothesis that the intervention communities will achieve at
least a 3 mmHg greater reduction in mean community systolic blood pressure than control communities. In the
third aim, we will use convergent mixed methods guided by the RE-AIM framework to measure reach to
religious leaders and community members, effect on community blood pressure and linkage to care, adoption
by religious leaders, fidelity to the planned intervention, and maintenance of the benefit at 24 months. We will
refine the intervention for dissemination and implementation in partnership with biomedical and religious
leaders. The proposed research is innovative because it uses a novel approach to impact community health, it
offers contextual flexibility to be adapted by religious leaders or other trusted community messengers for their
own contexts, and it may be a creative way to engage men. The proposed research is significant because a
community systolic blood pressure reduction of 3 mmHg is estimated to decrease premature cardiovascular
mortality by 13% in that community. If successful, this approach could prevent many thousands of deaths in
Tanzania and could be adapted for use in U.S. communities in which hypertension outcomes are poor."
10760214,"Project Summary
Although the basal ganglia (BG) have long been implicated in action selection, the specific
circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. According to traditional models, the role of the
inhibitory BG output is to open a gate to select a specific action via disinhibition. Recent work,
however, has questioned this model by demonstrating that BG output is far more complex than
originally assumed. By measuring continuous behavioral measures and neural activity
simultaneously, recent studies showed that there are multiple functional classes of BG output
neurons representing different vector components of actions. In particular, striatal output
neurons were shown to encode movement velocity whereas nigral output neurons represent
instantaneous position coordinates. These results suggest that BG circuits contain a neural
integrator whose output can specify detailed spatial and temporal features of actions precisely
and continuously. These results suggest a new model in which direct (striatonigral) and indirect
(striatopallidal) pathwayswork together to quantitatively shape action commands. This proposal
aims to elucidate how these pathways contribute to motivated behavior in mice. It is
hypothesized that direct and indirect pathways implement specific computational functions:
whereas direct pathway output determines the rate of change in the neural integrator output, the
indirect pathway discharges the integrator. To test this hypothesis, we will use in vivo calcium
imaging to measure neural activity in direct and indirect pathway neurons in the sensorimotor
striatum with single-neuron resolution in reward-guided behavior. We will also use optogenetic
to manipulate activity in these pathways selectively, in order to determine their causal
contributions to behavior, and to determine how dopamine may modulate their activity in freely
behaving mice. Finally, we will study functional interactions between direct and indirect
pathways via recurrent inhibition. Results from proposed experiments will have significant
implications for understanding and treating various disorders implicating the BG."
11047348,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Activation of nuclear receptors, a family of ligand-dependent transcription factors, is used
extensively in pharmacology to develop drug targets for diverse medical conditions, including
metabolic disease and cancer. While synthetic agonists and antagonists of nuclear receptors
ameliorate symptoms of many diseases, clinical use of these compounds leads to frequent side
effects that range in their severity. Type II receptors, such as FXR, LXR, and PPAR, which
function in fatty acid, bile acid, cholesterol, and glucose metabolism, are permanently positioned
in the nucleus regardless of the ligand status. The accepted paradigm regarding ligand activation
of type II receptors is a two-step process: 1) the receptor is bound to DNA in complex with a co-
repressor in absence of the ligand; 2) binding of the ligand induces a conformational change, co-
repressor/co-activator exchange, and initiation of transcription. However, we observe that
distribution of open chromatin sites changes upon ligand activation of nuclear receptors. In this
project, I hypothesize that pioneer factor Foxa2 modulates chromatin accessibility by evicting
nucleosomes to enable LXRα binding upon ligand activation, which challenges the accepted
paradigm.
 Considering current limitations to develop highly selective synthetic ligands for nuclear
receptors without significant side effects we propose that a genomic approach that separates LXR
targets into distinct regulatory modes characterized by chromatin state and presence/absence of
Foxa2 and LXRα binding sites will allow for genes with different physiological function to be
targeted separately. We will test whether Foxa2 and LXRα binding is interdependent during ligand
activation in Aim 1. We will ascertain the mechanism of Foxa2/LXRα interaction, discriminating
between three possibilities in Aim 2. LXR could play the role of a co-activator without binding
DNA, or both Foxa2 and LXRα need to be bound either in a proximal interaction or distal
interaction. Successful completion of our project will change current thinking regarding activation
of ligand-dependent gene expression and change the pharmacological approach to target nuclear
receptors essential to metabolism."
10765690,"Astrocytes are ideally positioned to support neuronal/synaptic needs for trophic factors, metabolic
homeostasis, and protection from toxicity. While reactive astrogliosis is a prominent feature of AD, this offers
very limited insight about how astrocytes influence the disease process or how they may be harmed.
 One of the most important functions of astrocytes is to clear extracellular glutamate to prevent excitotoxicity.
Glutamate taken up by astrocytes is also used as a metabolic substrate for biosynthesis of other neuro-
transmitters like GABA. Thus, there are at least two major ways astrocytic glutamate clearance protects the
brain. In cortex and hippocampus, the glutamate transporter Slc1a2 (also called GLT1 or EAAT2) plays the
most important role in glutamate clearance. Most, but not all Slc1a2 is in astrocytes.
 Our research team has shown that: (i) Slc1a2 is disturbed in AD; (ii) Slc1a2 loss in an AD mouse model
accelerates onset of cognitive impairment; (iii) A42 slows synaptically-released glutamate uptake in hippo-
campal slices; and (iv) mice with reduced astrocytic Slc1a2 display significant transcriptomic overlaps with AD.
 These data complement strong work from other groups and collectively argue that Slc1a2 dysfunction may
play an important role in AD. However, additional critical questions need to be answered to better understand
how astrocytic Slc1a2 may interact with A42 and tau pathology. Specifically, is there pathogenic synergy
among these processes? In AD more needs to be uncovered about the relationship between neurons and the
fine (often GFAP-negative) astrocytic processes expressing nearly all Slc1a2 in the brain—an anatomical
relationship that is crucial to their function. In addition, there is insufficient data supporting the hypothesis that
astrocytic Slc1a2 can play a contributing or causal role in exacerbating A42 and tau pathology.
 The goal of this project is to fill these knowledge gaps. First, we will use novel mice with reduced Slc1a2
specifically in astrocytes; and with adenoviral vectors (AAVs) expressing A42 and tauP301L, dissect the in
vivo molecular interactions between these pathogenic pathways. We will address whether astrocytes are lost in
response to A42 and/or tau. We will use a novel lentivirus system expressing Slc1a2, which infects astrocytes,
to test whether specifically rescuing astrocytic Slc1a2 ameliorates neuropathology, as well as Slc1a2 function.
Second, using state-of-the art patch clamp methods that directly measure astrocyte glutamate clearance,
dissect how Slc1a2 loss, A42, and tau expression interact to affect astrocytic glutamate clearance. We will
address how these pathogenic processes influence astrocytic Slc1a2 that regulate synaptic network excitability
by supporting GABAergic transmission. Third, using well-characterized postmortem brains from control,
prodromal, and AD patients we will test the potential translational significance of the glutamate transporter and
astrocyte neuropathology we have reported and is suggested by our new preliminary data. Together, these
data hold promise of advancing our knowledge of Slc1a2 as a potential molecular target for intervention in AD."

10766219,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Administrative Core) 
Injury contributes to over 30 million emergency department visits annually1 and is the leading cause of death for 
individuals 1-44 years of age. The burden of these injuries can be reduced through injury control which includes 
primary prevention of injuries, optimal acute care of the injured patient and rehabilitation of the injured patient2. 
Yet injury control research is underfunded compared to other leading causes of death3,4 and while some COBRE 
active awards address basic science of traumatic brain injury, no active COBRE awards focus on injury control5. 
The mission of the Rhode Island Hospital Injury Control COBRE is to support the development of independent 
researchers to lead rigorous, innovative injury control research that changes practice and improves health. 
Research Project Leaders (RPL) will conduct studies utilizing two research cores (Injury Control Digital 
Innovation Core and Injury Control Research to Practice and Policy Core) with support from strong mentorship, 
leaving them well positioned to emerge as independently funded injury control research leaders. A pilot project 
program will support research proposals for future investigators to continue the growth of independent 
researchers in this important field of research. A strong mentorship program will ensure the success of current 
RPLs, pilot study investigators and cultivate future injury control researchers. The Administrative Core will 
provide the administrative, fiscal and scientific infrastructure for the research cores to assure that RPLs achieve 
research and career development success. This objective will be accomplished through the following specific 
aims: 1) Enact an organizational structure consisting of an Executive Committee, External Advisory Committee, 
Internal Advisory Committee and Community Advisory Board that will provide clear direction for the COBRE to 
succeed in meeting its mission; 2) Develop a mentoring program that supports RPLs in achieving their injury 
control related research and career goals and their transition to independent investigator status; 3) Implement 
a pilot project program that aligns with the research core objectives and identifies future RPLs and 4) Partner 
with an External Advisory Committee to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of all components of the RIH Injury 
Control COBRE. By supporting the development of junior investigators dedicated to injury control research, the 
COBRE will increase the number of independent injury control researchers advancing research that will tackle 
injury control challenges and improve population health. The establishment of this Administrative Core will 
provide the administrative, fiscal and scientific infrastructure necessary to successfully carryout the mission of 
the Rhode Island Hospital Injury Control COBRE."
10766220,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Injury Control Research to Practice and Policy Core)
Injury poses the greatest threat to life for those under 40 years of age and is a prevalent cause of morbidity and
mortality across the lifespan. Rigorous research is needed to address the spectrum of injury prevention across
the lifespan given the enormous burden trauma and injury pose to both individual and public health. Strategies
are needed to prevent injuries (e.g., older adults with falls), and identify those at risk of recurrent injury or
morbidity (e.g., non-accidental childhood trauma). This must also be coupled with efforts to mitigate the
consequences of adverse post-traumatic sequelae (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder). Beyond the conduct of
high quality, efficient research, it is imperative to design injury control research such that it can rapidly be
integrated into public health policies and clinical practice (‘Research to Policy and Practice’). In typical research
practice, it takes years to conduct research and disseminate research findings to target audiences; by the time
research findings are available these strategies can be often outdated. It is necessary to conceptualize future
translation, dissemination and implementation from the moment of research conceptualization and throughout
the research process. The Injury Control Research to Practice and Policy (RPP) Core will equip COBRE affiliated
investigators with tools to tailor their study methodologies and dissemination strategies for accelerated impact
on in clinical practice and policy. The objective of the RPP Core is to establish a regional and national hub
leading the development, conduct, analysis and dissemination of high-quality, scientifically sound injury control
research. The RPP Core will feature rigorous support to design, implement, and disseminate studies capable of
practice or policy level change. This objective will be reached through the following specific aims: 1) provide a
robust infrastructure of methodologic support in order to facilitate injury control research moving forward into
clinical practice and policy and 2) create systems to train injury control researchers to rapidly and effectively
disseminate research findings with the goal of impacting clinical practice and policy. The RPP Core establishes
a bridge from research to policy and practice, for communicating the designs and findings of the COBRE. This
is accomplished through high level individualized support, training and mentorship. The RPP Core inspires
innovation in translational research, promoting interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists, clinicians,
community members, and stakeholders."
10766222,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Injury Control Digital Innovation Core)
While systematic public health approaches successfully reduced incidence and mortality of several types of injury
over the last century, these gains have been largely erased in the last decade due to new risk factors and
reductions in old protective factors. A novel, rigorous approach to injury control is needed. Recent evidence,
both from our team and researchers beyond our state, suggest that the use of novel “digital health” tools can be
feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in measuring and reducing the incidence and the consequences of injuries.
Promising preliminary data exists regarding the utility of digital health for all aspects of injury control, ranging
from surveillance to tertiary prevention. The development and dissemination of effective injury-focused digital
products are limited, however, by lack of rigor and expertise in their development, evaluation, and dissemination.
In the Injury Control Digital Innovation Core, we will be able to extend our prior work to help transform the
measurement and delivery of injury control on a wider scale by providing expert support and technical assistance
to junior investigators and COBRE affiliated researchers at Rhode Island Hospital. The long-term goal of Injury
Control Digital Innovation Core is to establish a regional and national hub leading the development,
analysis, and dissemination of high-quality, scientifically sound, effective digital health innovations
focused on injury control. This objective will be met through the following aims: 1) Provide a scientifically
rigorous structure that facilitates the development and evaluation of innovative digital health-based injury
control, through expert consultation on qualitative research (user experience testing, formative research),
analysis of big data, and study design; 2) Facilitate partnerships between researchers, clinicians, at-risk
populations, and relevant industry-based partners, with a focus on enhancing quality and equitable dissemination
of COBRE-funded injury control research and 3) Develop and maintain ongoing an “innovation lab” of
asynchronous and real-time injury-focused digital health training resources for junior researchers. The
achievement of these aims in the Injury Control Digital Innovation Core of the Injury Control COBRE will have
immense impact on the capabilities and impact of our local researchers. It will also enhance the scientific rigor
of the field at large by disseminating best practices and innovative new scientific modalities for injury control.
Finally, we will be able to grow the long-term public health impact of our COBRE-affiliated researchers, by
enabling them to use measurement and intervention tools that represent the future of rigorous science."
10932896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pain is one of the most common and costly health problems worldwide. Due in part to the inadequacies of
purely biomedical approaches, many people are increasingly seeking complementary approaches to pain man-
agement, including music-based interventions (MBIs). Although the pain-relieving effects of MBIs are well-es-
tablished, lack of understanding of MBIs' mechanisms of action prevents us from exploiting their full therapeu-
tic potential. In order for mechanistic research on music and pain to progress in an efficient and rigorous man-
ner, the building of a multidisciplinary research workforce capable of leading innovative mechanistic studies is
needed. To this end, we propose to create the Music4Pain Network, a multidisciplinary research network that
will bring together neuroscientists, music therapists, musicians, neuropsychologists, rehabilitation scientists,
psychophysiologists, and more. The Music4Pain Network aims to accelerate knowledge in three key areas: (1)
development of a taxonomy of key terms and definitions related to MBIs and music, (2) increased understand-
ing of the mechanisms underlying the benefits of music for pain, and (3) identification of biomarkers and per-
son variables that predict treatment response to MBIs. Network activities will be guided by a formal research
agenda that will be developed by the Network's Core Investigator Team in collaboration with scientists with
complementary expertise. The Music4Pain Network will forge new multidisciplinary research collaborations by
(1) actively promoting the Network across disciplines to recruit experts with relevant and complimentary
knowledge, (2) building an interactive Network website to enable identification of potential collaborators, shar-
ing of resources, and featuring of Network activities and products, (3) promoting the Network using social me-
dia platforms, and (4) organizing annual meetings, webinars, and Music and Pain Special Interest Groups. In
addition, the Music4Pain Network will stimulate innovative, multidisciplinary mechanistic research through pilot
funding. The pilot funding will support the collection of innovative data to strengthen independent research
funding applications. The Network will also fund Visiting Scholar positions to help PhD students and postdoc-
toral fellows gain skills and expertise related to Network goals. In addition, the Network will build the music and
pain research workforce by mentoring new and early career investigators to develop research skills and sup-
port their efforts in obtaining extramural funding. The work that will be made possible through the Music4Pain
Network will enable the development of new, or optimization of existing, MBIs so that acute and chronic pain
can be better managed with a low-cost, non-pharmacological approach that has wide appeal to a large number
of people. Improved efficacy of MBIs and better understanding of their mechanisms of action will speed up
their adoption in clinical care. This could have important consequences for the millions of Americans currently
living with pain."
10994586,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Unreliable access to safe and sufficient water for all household uses (i.e., water insecurity) is a common but
understudied public health issue. Although water is itself a critical nutrient that is essential for agricultural
production, food preparation, and hygienic practices that reduce exposure to enteric pathogens, few studies
have examined the role of water insecurity in nutrition; most consider water quality only. A more holistic
conceptualization of water insecurity could reveal important pathways by which water accessibility, reliability,
and adequacy impact diet and health.
 Water insecurity presents substantial barriers to cooking nutrient-dense foods, which often require
considerable water to be made palatable and safe for consumption. Qualitative studies have reported that water
insecurity limits breastfeeding duration and undermines the ability of caregivers to prepare preferred
complementary foods. Individuals experiencing water insecurity are also more likely to substitute water with
sugar-sweetened beverages, plausibly contributing to weight gain and increased risk of overweight and obesity.
The proposed project seeks to expand upon this formative work by examining the extent to which differential
exposure to water insecurity impacts diet quality and body composition throughout the life course.
 A mixed-methods approach is required to comprehensively understand how water insecurity manifests at the
household level and subsequently impacts nutritional well-being. The proposed project will therefore use
qualitative data to complement quantitative data from 2 existing cohort studies that comprehensively measured
water insecurity and diet among infants, children, adolescents, and adults on San Cristóbal Island, Ecuador and
in Cebu, Philippines. Specifically, the project aims to qualitatively describe how issues with water availability,
accessibility, and use impact food production, purchase, and preparation (Aim 1). Multi-level modeling will be
used to assess whether household water insecurity undermines child diet quality (Aim 2) and longitudinal
structural equation modeling will be applied to evaluate how changes in household water insecurity throughout
early development impact adiposity (Aim 3).
 The project will address a recognized knowledge gap within the field by using advanced statistical procedures
to model water insecurity as a multidimensional, time-varying exposure. Findings from this work have the
potential to reveal new targets for addressing the growing burden of malnutrition. Additionally, the proposed
rigorous curriculum in nutrition and epidemiology, as well as mentorship from thought leaders in the water and
nutrition sectors, will prepare the applicant for an academic career in global nutrition."

Since the birth of the first child from in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the UK in 1978 and in the US in 1981, more than
ten million babies have been born from this technology, including more than 1.37 million babies annually
worldwide. In 2018, IVF births accounted for 2.24% of all US births and 3.1% of all UK births. Consistent research
findings indicate that IVF-conceived pregnancies and IVF-conceived children are at greater risk for a spectrum
of adverse perinatal outcomes. A persistent, unresolved issue remains what proportion of the adverse perinatal
and child health outcomes after IVF is due to parental factors and what proportion is due to the IVF procedures.
In the US, the national IVF database, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome
Reporting System is left-censored at 2004; it is not feasible to obtain data on earlier cycles. In addition, the US
has few national databases to facilitate tracking children’s health over time. To overcome these limitations, we
are partnering with researchers in the UK in this proposed study. The UK system, under the Human Fertilisation
and Embryology Authority, can track individuals treated as early as 1991, linking all adults treated and all children
conceived with IVF to a number of national databases. Through this collaboration, we seek to draw upon the
strengths of each country: in the UK, longer follow-up and more linked health databases; in the US, more annual
IVF cycles and births; and more racial and ethnic diversity. The long-term health of children conceived with IVF
is still not clearly understood. Follow-up studies of the growth and health of IVF-conceived children have been
limited by small sample sizes, high drop-out rates, and methodological issues, with many knowledge gaps
remaining. In this proposed renewal, we are seeking to overcome these limitations using an early life-course
approach to evaluate the growth and health of children born from IVF, from conception through childhood, and
for the UK component, through adulthood. The two primary aims of this proposed renewal are (1)
comprehensively evaluate the role of IVF conception on birth defects, cancer, and the co-occurrence of these
conditions through large-scale registry linkages and analysis of the neonatal methylome and (2) to evaluate the
effect of IVF treatment parameters, specifically the use of ICSI, number of embryos transferred (embryonic and/or
fetal loss as plurality at conception versus at birth), oocyte source/state-embryo state combinations, on child
growth (size at birth, and height and weight at ages 4-5 and 10-11) and health (birth defects, cancer, acute and
chronic illness, and premature mortality), accounting for parental, socioeconomic, and environmental factors.
This proposed study will include a total of more than 4.75 million children, including more than 458,000 IVF-
conceived children born 1991-2018, 88,000 naturally-conceived siblings, and 4.2 million naturally-conceived
control children, with 80.6 million person-years of follow-up, averaging 14.4 years in the US (ranging from birth
to age 22) and 18.3 years in the UK (ranging from birth to age 36), and will provide a comprehensive
contemporary picture of child health after conception by in vitro fertilization."

The 1.7 million adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) globally urgently need interventions to help improve
retention, adherence, and ultimately viral load suppression (VLS). With both high rates of incident infection
and some of the lowest VLS rates, ALHIV experience high mortality with approximately 100 deaths per day.
Successful interventions to improve retention and VLS among ALHIV in low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC) remain limited. Video-based interventions that provide counseling to patients living with HIV have
increased patient HIV knowledge, supported disclosure, fostered behavior change, and improved treatment
adherence. Targeted messaging can be woven into culturally relevant films with engaging storylines and
delivered at critical teachable moments. Films can be shown in high-volume clinics to deliver standardized
counseling content while freeing up HCW time. While video-based interventions have the potential to address
barriers to ALHIV ART retention and adherence, they are not commonly used throughout Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA). Our team was one of the first to pilot and study the impact of a video-based intervention on HIV service
delivery; preliminary results have suggested high levels of patient and HCW satisfaction, improved ART
knowledge, adherence, and retention. Based on these promising results, we propose to adapt, assess and
support scale up of a tailored, video-based counseling package for ALHIV: VITAL (Video Intervention to Inspire
Treatment Adherence for Life) Start for Adolescents (VS4A). Our study will examine the impact of VS4A on
the primary composite outcome of retention and adherence (viral load <1000 copies/ml) in a multisite two-arm
cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) with 1:1 randomization in Malawi. Our overall hypothesis is that
VS4A will a) achieve broad reach, b) be acceptable and feasible to implement, c) improve adolescent
VLS and several secondary outcomes; and d) be cost-effective at scale. If effective, VS4A can be an
innovative, scalable tool to improve service delivery for ALHIV while also liberating HCW time and reducing
health system burden in Malawi. Building on a 15-year partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH), a
track record of excellence and innovation in service to ALHIV, and a robust implementation science research
portfolio, our team is poised to successfully implement the VS4A study and program and to use findings to
support rapid, wide-scale dissemination and scale up."

Injectable drugs constitute a $400+ billion market worldwide, and the range of devices for delivery
is expanding to improve factors such as patient compliance, reduced pain, self-administration,
and delivery efficiency. Intradermal delivery is especially pertinent in this regard for potential
confluences of reduced pain, fast immune response and fractional dose vaccination. Also high on
the priority list for delivery technologies are nucleic acids, which are seen as promising biological
drugs for a range of immune disorders and infectious diseases. There are currently over 900
biological drugs on the market or in development. Amongst these, plasmid DNA vaccines have
been widely studied over the last two decades and are being developed for Ebola, MERS, Zika,
Hepatitis B, and HIV. However, a major obstacle is the method of delivery due to the large physical
size of the molecules, which can render products that are high-viscosity, creating issues for
injectability with standard hypodermic needles.
This exploratory grant will develop prototype devices, based on blister-pack concepts, for
intradermal injection of viscous suspensions, with the primary target being DNA products. Guided
by approaches using hollow microneedles, we will fabricate and test single-orifice and multi-orifice
modules that target intradermal delivery. The prototypes will be tested across a broad range of
fluid viscosities and existing drugs. The proposed study comprises a proof-of-concept for our
devices using ex-vivo tissues, and limited in-vivo studies using guinea pigs, a clinically relevant
model for intradermal delivery. The overarching goal is to optimize intradermal delivery,
specifically with regards to high-viscosity products in order to advance the feasibility of
widespread DNA vaccination."

Adult stem cell exhaustion is a hallmark of aging. However, mechanisms of stem cell exhaustion during aging
are largely unknown, and there are no therapies that can delay stem cell aging in humans. C. elegans is a
premier model organism for studying aging; adult animals are short lived and only contain one stem cell pool,
the germline stem cells that generate eggs and sperm. Extensive developmental studies have provided a rich
description of the molecular and cellular events that control these stem cells in young animals. My goal is to
understand stem cell exhaustion, and my strategy is to exploit the experimental power of C. elegans and the
detailed knowledge of stem cell development to elucidate stem cell aging. The somatic distal tip cell (DTC) serves
as the stem cell niche by expressing the Notch pathway ligands LAG-2 and APX-1, which bind and activate the
GLP-1/Notch receptor in the stem cells. Notch signaling pathways are conserved during evolution and have been
repeatedly implicated in regulating stem cells in mammals, suggesting the niche/stem cell system in worms is
likely to be broadly relevant. Elucidating the regulatory logic of this system will advance the fields of
reproductive aging and stem cell exhaustion. Preliminary results from our lab demonstrate that the number
and activity of germline stem cells decline rapidly and progressively with age. Based on these results, I propose
two innovative hypotheses. (1) An age-related decline in Notch signaling from the DTC niche causes stem cell
exhaustion. (2) Neuronal TGF-β signaling mediates the activity of the DTC niche and contributes to the age-
related decline of adult stem cells in the germline. To test these hypotheses, I propose two specific aims. Aim
1: Elucidate mechanisms of Notch pathway regulation during adult stem cell aging in the germline. I will
monitor LAG-2 ligand expression in the DTC niche during aging and analyze LAG-2 ligand and Notch receptor
function. The results will rigorously test my hypothesis by establishing how LAG-2 ligand expression is regulated
during aging and whether LAG-2 ligand and/or GLP-1/Notch receptor are sufficient to sustain stem cell activity
during aging. Aim 2: Determine how sensory neurons regulate the DTC niche to mediate germline stem
cell aging. I will analyze the DAF-3 binding site in the lag-2 promoter, and the DAF-3 and DAF-5 transcription
factors that are the effectors of TGF-β signaling. I will examine multiple levels of organization including protein
expression, stem cell dynamics, and progeny production. The results will establish how neuronal signals control
the niche and stem cells during aging. The mechanisms of stem cell exhaustion remain mysterious, and these
experiments will advance the field by determining the contributions of neurons, the niche, and the stem cells
themselves. The results will establish a foundation of knowledge that may stimulate innovative approaches to
preserve stem cell function and promote healthy aging in humans."

Stroke is a devastating disease and leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Ischemic stroke
results in massive activation of numerous immune cells that can infiltrate the brain following blood-brain-barrier
breakdown. The gut microbiota has previously been identified as a significant factor affecting outcome and
severity of ischemic stroke in clinical studies and animal models. However, mechanisms underlying the
modulatory role of microbiota on immune cells following stroke remain unclear. Dendritic cells (DCs) act as the
bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, with their ability to sample material from the intestinal lumen and
shape T-cell responses. Antibiotic-induced alteration of microbiota in mice results in stroke neuroprotection in
mice following middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke compared to control mice carrying
conventional microbiota, which are similarly treated but carry antibiotic-resistant microbiota resulting in
microbiota similar to that of naïve mice. This effect is attributed to the greater capacity of intestinal and mesenteric
lymph node dendritic cells of mice carrying “altered” microbiota to induce T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in the small
intestine which subsequently suppress destructive pro-inflammatory IL-17+ γδ T cells that traffic to the brain
following stroke. Using our in vitro model to simulate intestinal DC-T cell interactions, we show that priming naïve
DCs with isolated contents from the small intestine (SIC) of mice carrying “altered” or “conventional” microbiota
and subsequent co-culture with CD4 cells similarly induces greater proportions of Tregs following SIC from mice
carrying “altered” microbiota compared to SIC from mice with “conventional” microbiota. This proposal seeks to
elucidate the mechanism by which altering microbiota may result in changes in pattern-recognition receptors or
toll-like receptor ligands that are responsible for a DC-tolerizing phenotype and Treg induction observed with
microbiota alteration in mice. Using a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches, I aim to identify the DC receptors
and signaling machinery responsible for sensing these luminal contents and producing a tolerogenic phenotype,
determine DC-produced signals/cytokines necessary for intestinal Treg induction, and establish the role of pro-
inflammatory IL-6 in stroke neuroprotection vs poor stroke outcome in mice carrying “altered” or “conventional”
microbiota. In summary, I seek to understand how intestinal DC receptor ligands that are microbiota-dependent
can act as regulators of intestinal immunity and stroke outcome, as well as identify potential therapeutic targets."

About 37 million people live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide and about 71% of people living
with HIV (PLWH) reside in low and middle income countries (LMICs). HIV enters the central nervous system
(CNS) early after infection and increases the risk for mild-to-severe neurocognitive and cardiovascular disorders.
Studies show that about 30 to 40% of PLWH will have neurologic complications leading to long-term motor and
cognitive disability, including HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Few studies have examined
how best to provide objective assessment, diagnostic, and rehabilitative treatment tools to aid people living with
disabilities as a result of HIV and HIV-stroke in LMICs. The need for these tools is great in LMICs, given the
greatly limited infrastructure and healthcare resources and thus decreased access to consistent, quality
rehabilitation. Our long-term goal is to develop innovative and affordable robot technologies to bridge healthcare
care gaps in LMICs and leverage them to help objectively assess, diagnose and treat PLWH presenting with
motor and cognitive impairment due to HAND and Stroke. In this R21 project, we leverage our affordable
robot therapy system augmented with objective metrics and motor and cognitive exergames to assess
PLWH in Botswana—a country with the fourth highest HIV prevalence rate (20.3%) in the world, an increasing
NCD prevalence rate, and limited rehab resources. Aim 1 determines concurrent validity and reliability of using
the robot therapy system to objectively ASSESS cognitive, and motor impairments in PLWH. Forty (40) PLWH
and 40 HIV-negative controls will be evaluated using both clinical metrics and new robot-based metrics at two
time points, at least 1-week apart. We hypothesize that robot-based metrics will have test-retest reliability as well
as concurrent validity with clinical measures of motor and cognitive function that usually require rehabilitation
expertise and man-power to complete. Aim 2 determines the feasibility of developing a robot-based classification
of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). 80 PLWH without stroke will be evaluated using an
augmented neuropsychological (NP) battery required to meet minimal HAND Frascati criteria and the robot
assessment tasks. We will use the Frascati criteria and global deficit scoring (GDS) to classify the PLWH
participants into asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) and HIV-
associated dementia (HAD). We will develop a regression model using derived robot metrics and test its ability
to predict HAND and GDS score. We hypothesize that the robot-based model will classify HAND with specificity
and sensitivity better than HAND screening with International HIV Dementia Scale and Montreal Cognitive
Assessment. The Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) will be used as empirical validation. Demographic, HIV, and
lifestyle factors such as age, viral load, hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis C, and tobacco will be used to determine
which increased the risk for HAND."
10758853,"Ligand-dependent protein degradation has emerged as a compelling strategy to pharmacologically control the
protein content of cells. This strategy has advantages that include converting silent ‘protein-binding’ small
molecules to ‘protein degraders’, which has the potential to substantially increase the number of druggable
proteins in human disease such as cancer, and to operate in a catalytic manner that may lower the drug
concentrations required to produce a pharmacological effect. Nonetheless, until recently, only a handful of the
600+ human E3 ligases have been found to support this process. Importantly, these E3 ligases have been
found to show distinct and restricted substrate specificities, underscoring the need to discover additional
ligandable E3 ligases with differentiated properties to realize the full scope of targeted protein degradation as a
pharmacological strategy. We recently leveraged chemoproteomic platforms and molecular biology
approaches to identify DCAF16, a poorly characterized E3 ligase, as a target of electrophilic probes that
promotes the nuclear-restricted degradation of proteins. Importantly, DCAF16 is capable of supporting ligand-
induced protein degradation at low fractional engagement (10-40%), which may enable the degradation of
target proteins while minimally perturbing its endogenous substrates. In this proposal, by integrating
chemoproteomic platforms with cell biology and molecular biology approaches, I plan to 1) identify endogenous
substrates and biological functions of DCAF16, 2) screen and identify small molecules that disrupt cancer cell
growth by engaging DCAF16 and inducing neo-substrate degradation, and 3) discover additional E3 ligases
with distinct and restricted expressions in different cancer types that support ligand-induced targeted protein
degradation. My long-term goals are to develop potent and selective chemical probes for DCAF16 and other
druggable E3 ligases and to develop pharmacological tools to intervene hard-to-drug or even ‘undruggable’
cancer targets. The proposed studies will be carried out at The Scripps Research Institute, a top-ranking
research institution which combines cutting edge biological and chemical research to offer a unique cross-
disciplinary scientific environment. To build a successful career development and training program, I will attend
an array of TSRI- or UCSD-hosted courses, workshops and seminars that will comprehensively advance my
skills in mentoring, teaching, scientific communication, critical assessment and laboratory management. I will
benefit tremendously from the mentored phase training with Dr. Benjamin Cravatt who has over 20 years of
experiences in developing small molecule inhibitors of protein targets as well as chemical proteomic
technologies, Dr. Michael Erb who has expertise in transcriptional biology in cancer, and my advisory
committee, which includes prominent scientists – Dr. Jeffery Kelly and Dr. Dale Boger. The proposed studies
will not only push the boundaries of our knowledge of targeted protein degradation, but may also be the
starting point for the development of novel therapeutics targeting important yet undruggable proteins in cancer."

Novel HIV-1 treatment strategies that maintain viral suppression while allowing time off small molecule
antiretroviral treatment (ART) are of high priority. An ART-sparing treatment intervention using potent and long-
acting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) may reduce direct ART toxicities during critical periods of growth
and development for children with HIV, will ensure adherence, and may have benefits over ART for viral reservoir
reduction and post-treatment control. bNAbs have been associated with reduction in viral reservoirs, and recent
studies support a potential vaccine-like effect that may train immune responses and improve long-term
outcomes. Like early-treated adults, early-treated children may have the best chance to become post-treatment
controllers, but further studies are needed -- including studies that utilize an analytic treatment interruption (ATI).
We recently completed the Tatelo Study, a proof-of-concept trial demonstrating that monthly treatment with dual
bNAbs could maintain viral suppression for 24 weeks without ART in 44% of early-ART treated children. We also
showed that specific markers for success were identifiable, and that interruption of standard ART could be safely
performed in our study setting. In the proposed study (Tatelo Plus), we will perform a multi-step interventional
clinical trial that advances the field farther. Using a novel step-wise design and an innovative bNAb rotation
strategy, we will first determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and reservoir impact of long-acting triple
bNAb immunotherapy with VRC07-523LS, PGDM1400LS and PGT121-414LS when added to existing effective
ART. In selected participants with favorable markers for success, we will next measure triple-bNAb treatment
success following ART discontinuation. Finally, we will test for the maintenance of virologic control during an ATI
in an even more highly selected group of participants -- those with extremely low viral reservoir or evidence of
HIV integration in non-encoding regions of the genome. The specific aims of this study are (1) to determine the
safety, pharmacokinetics and dosing of up to 24 weeks of concomitant use of triple bNAb immunotherapy when
added to ART in 35 early-treated children living with HIV-1 in Botswana; (2) to determine the safety, maintenance
of virologic suppression, and CD4 cell count preservation of 24 weeks of maintenance triple bNAb treatment
following the discontinuation of standard ART in selected early-treated children; and (3) to determine the safety,
maintenance of virologic suppression, and CD4 cell count preservation of a 24 week ATI among two groups: a)
those with markers for the lowest viral reservoir, and b) those with evidence of HIV-1 integration in predominantly
non-encoding regions of the genome. At each study step, we will measure the size and cellular composition of
residual viral reservoirs, and the magnitude and quality of antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses. This
study will represent a leap forward for combination bNAb treatment in children, and will advance the pediatric
cure agenda through a carefully conducted ATI."
10765448,"Abstract.
Most biological processes require the production and degradation of cellular proteins. Maintaining a balanced
protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is therefore essential to cellular fitness. Furthermore, lapses in proteostasis
have been linked to the molecular basis of a wide variety of genetic diseases. Nevertheless, our understanding
of how the cell buffers adaptive swings in proteostasis and how this is perturbed by mutations remains
incomplete. This is especially true for integral membrane proteins (MPs), which account for a quarter of the
proteome and include most drug targets. The production of folded, functional, and properly localized MPs is both
inefficient and sensitive to the effects of mutations that promote misfolding. The net efficiency of this process is
established by the interactions that nascent MPs form with chaperones that mediate quality control. Most MPs
form interactions with an array of QC proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that establish the balance
between the degradation of immature protein and the export of mature protein from the secretory pathway. We
recently demonstrated that this balance is highly sensitive to the propensity of nascent MPs to adopt alternative
topologies with respect to the membrane. We found that mutations that promote these defects impact MP
expression and ligand binding in a manner that shapes both MP evolution and the molecular basis of disease.
Furthermore, we also found that the mechanical forces generated by formation of alternative topologies can alter
the outcomes of ribosomal protein synthesis. However, it remains unclear how certain topologies are selectively
recognized by molecular chaperones and how these interactions ultimately shape MP biosynthesis and
degradation. In the following, we outline innovative approaches to identify specific conformational defects that
promote the interaction of nascent MPs with various molecular chaperones including the ER membrane protein
complex and calnexin- two mechanistically distinct intramembrane chaperones. By combining CRISPR with deep
mutational scanning (DMS), we will determine which classes of mutations and their associated conformational
defects promote interactions with these chaperones and how this ultimately shapes mutational tolerance.
Additionally, we will build on our recent discoveries to gain insights into how these cotranslational processes
impact the fidelity membrane protein biosynthesis itself. We describe the discovery of a novel ribosomal
frameshift site within the CFTR transcript and provide evidence suggesting this motif selectively terminates
translation of a common misfolded variant responsible for most cases of cystic fibrosis (ΔF508). These findings
point to a novel role of ribosomal frameshifting in the regulation of membrane protein homeostasis. We outline
ongoing efforts to identify factors that modulate this regulation and to discover and characterize comparable
motifs in other disease linked MPs including the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1. Together, our findings
will provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of membrane protein biosynthesis and quality control as well
as how these constraints factor into the molecular basis of proteostatic diseases of MP misfolding."

now in its fourth year, proposes to select six recent college graduates each year from backgrounds traditionally
underrepresented in science who desire PhD research careers and will benefit substantially from a year of
intensive research experience and custom mentoring. We prepare these promising students for entry into
rigorous PhD training programs and long-term success. Scholars visit Hopkins in April for a two-day Mentor-
Matching event to interview potential mentors in their field of interest, and are matched with an enthusiastic
Research Mentor. RESEARCH: Scholars learn, design, conduct and analyze hypothesis-driven experiments in
the mentor's lab, and participate in weekly lab meetings, journal clubs and departmental research seminars,
and a national conference. `Project Meetings' (mini-thesis meetings) are a key new feature: each Scholar
invites two subject-expert faculty in addition to their Research Mentor and PREP Director to three meetings
during their first year. Scholars prepare a written proposal for a one-hour discussion with their committee, and
benefit from their own support network of scientific mentors. Project Meetings have increased faculty
awareness of this program; 62 faculty are ready to serve as research mentors or advisors for PREP Scholars.
PREP COMMUNITY: Scholars gather for a two-hour `Chalktalks' event each month with dedicated Peer
Mentors (ten underrepresented minority PhD students and postdoctoral fellows) to practice talking science, ask
questions and get advice within our PREP community. Scholars also mix with PhD students at events including
a vibrant annual PhD program retreat. PROFESSIONAL TRAINING: Scholars participate in Research Ethics
workshops taught by the School of Medicine, an NSF (National Science Foundation) graduate fellowship
workshop, and Writing & Peer-Editing Workshops taught by the PREP Director. PERSONAL GROWTH: The
Director and Scholar create an individual development plan (IDP) to set goals and strengthen specific areas
needed to be competitive for PhD success. IDPs can include graduate-level coursework, practice interviews,
workshops (e.g., critical analysis, personal finances, time management, communication) and GRE/MCAT test
preparation funded by our institution. Scholars meet individually with the Director for one hour every month,
and informally as needed. This program will be evaluated yearly by direct feedback and by the Hopkins Office
of Assessment & Evaluation, including pre- and post-assessment of confidence in 21 areas of scientific
competence (self-efficacy). Success will be defined as the entry of at least 75% of PREP scholars into rigorous
PhD or MD/PhD programs nationwide, within two years of starting PREP. Our actual 2-year success rate so
far is 92%, and two Scholars were awarded National Science Foundation graduate fellowships in 2018. By
preparing outstanding URM trainees for PhD or MD/PhD careers, this program is having a positive impact on
PhD student diversity and fostering a culture of inclusion at Johns Hopkins and nationwide."
10766696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Children in foster care (FC) evidence poorer developmental, physical and mental health
outcomes than even the poorest children in the U.S. and unmet need in this fragile group is
extraordinarily high. Of the small number of early intervention programs demonstrated as
effective for this population, most are directed at infants and young children. However, more
than half of the children entering FC each year are older than 5 years, a time when capacity for
and expectations of self-regulation are greater, but history of maltreatment/trauma is likely more
extensive. Sleep disturbance is one of the most well-recognized consequences and enduring
sequela of early adversity/trauma that creates a feedback loop through which arousal/anxiety is
amplified, self-regulation is undermined, and biological rhythms are altered. Mounting evidence
reveals the presence of significant sleep disruption among a majority of children in FC, which is
closely associated with elevated mental health problems. Sleep disturbances are often worst in
the initial weeks/months of a new foster placement. Early intervention programs targeting sleep
might therefore prevent a cascade of associated negative outcomes. Our research team, with
unique expertise in pediatric sleep, childhood maltreatment, attachment, and the delivery of
foster care interventions, will use a trauma-informed framework to adapt cognitive-behavioral
therapy for pediatric insomnia for school-aged children recently placed in a new foster home.
Aligning with the goals of RFA-MH-18-706, we propose a 3-year, multi-phase study to finalize
and test a brief, home-based early intervention program, called Bolstering Sleep and
Adjustment in Foster Environments (B-SAFE). B-SAFE's target mechanisms are informed and
supported by a wealth of research showing reductions in children's nighttime anxiety/arousal
and greater parental support around bedtime/sleep routines to correspond with improvements in
children's sleep, emotional and behavioral health. Phase 1 will include input and feedback from
our FC agency partners, expert consultants, and several pilot families in order to finalize the B-
SAFE manual, materials, and procedures. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized, controlled
trial among N=60 new families; 30 will start the B-SAFE program within the first month of a new
child placement, and 30 will serve as waitlist (WL) controls. Several months later (Phase 3), WL
families will complete the B-SAFE program for comparison with the experimental group to
inform optimal intervention timing. Feasibility and child-based outcomes including sleep health,
emotional/behavioral regulation, and biological rhythms will be examined via objective and
subjective measures, and target engagement will be confirmed. In addition to supporting a
larger effectiveness trial, findings will directly inform dissemination efforts including training
practitioners, alternative delivery settings, and potential adaptation for other trauma-exposed
child populations, for whom evidence-based sleep interventions do not exist."

career in biomedical research. PIKE PREP will address barriers URM students are known to face in entering
and completing graduate programs. The PIKE PREP is a structured, yet highly customizable program that
offers a variety of activities that address the individual Scholar's research weaknesses as well as identify and
reinforce their strengths. We will couple evidence-based practices with metric-based evaluations to gauge and
improve efficacy of activities. The PIKE will focus on key attributes which we and others have identified as

activities, including mentorship in Research, Mental Health, Career, Leadership, and Role Model. Our main
purpose is to advance at least 80% of PREP Scholars to PhD or MD-PhD biomedical research programs on
our campus or at another top-tier PhD program. Aim 1 is to engage the Scholars in research while building
their technical skills through an exceptional biomedical research-focused experience. This aim will focus on
providing Scholars in an in-depth research experience by taking advantage of a wide range of resources as
well as highly productive and dedicated mentors with research expertise across a wide spectrum of
biomedical-related research. Aim 2 is to improve the Scholar's competitiveness for PhD programs by
providing analytical skills enhancement and substantial guidance on the graduate school application process.
Activities in this aim will help build a strong foundation in scientific reasoning, rigorous research design and
data analysis and interpretation. We will also guide students to prepare exceptional graduate school
applications, refine interview skills, and lead them to the most appropriate graduate programs that match their
interests and needs. Aim 3 will provide an assortment of high-quality professional and career development
activities to complement each PREP Scholar's research experience. We work closely with the Scholars and
mentors to develop, monitor, and refine IDPs for each Scholar based on individual career needs. Routine
evaluations of IDPs by our PREP Leadership Team will ensure that the PREP Scholar is making excellent
progress and that the training objectives of the IDP are met. Aim 4 will provide a continuous and dynamic
mentoring and community-building research-centered experience. PREP Scholars will have various
opportunities to network with URM and non-URM mentors, graduate students, postdocs and faculty and
different forums to become integrated into the social, research, and academic environments. The successful

The association between advanced age and impaired resistance to infections is well known, but poorly
understood. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of the vulnerability of the elderly to SARS-
CoV-2 infection as well as many other pathogens. Considerable research efforts have shown that components
of both the innate and adaptive immune systems show signs of dysfunction as we age, with signs of both
immunodeficiency, including reduced innate response and poor induction of adaptive immune memory, and
immunopathology including an exaggerated “cytokine storm”. However, while aspects of age-related changes
in immune cells have been explored in depth, the focus has been on defining the nature of dysfunction within
cells of the immune system itself, rather than investigating the potential role of other cell populations in
dominantly compromising immune homeostasis and immunological response to pathogens. Also, although the
increase in immunosenescence with age, defined by cell surface markers for immune cell exhaustion, has
been examined, the extent of cellular senescence in immune cell populations with age and pathogen exposure
remains undefined. Our recent findings indicate that senescent cells (SnCs), including senescent immune
cells, can exert a “bystander” effect on immune cells, provoking immunological dysfunction through secretion of
inflammatory factors, including cytokines and chemokines, termed the “senescence-associated secretory
phenotype” (SASP). We demonstrated that SASP factor production is increased when SnCs or mice containing
SnCs are exposed to pathogens or microbial products that induce innate immune activation. Exposure of old
mice to normal microbial experience (NME) housing resulted in 100% mortality compared to no mortality in
young mice. However, reducing the senescent cell burden in aged mice before or following pathogen exposure
reduced the spread of senescence, the cytokine storm and overall mortality. These results suggests that SnCs,
acting at least in part through SASP factors, can increase peripheral senescence and immune dysfunction
following pathogen exposure. Moreover, viral infection itself drives senescence, termed virus induced
senescence, in mice and humans. Using mouse models in which cellular senescence is induced specifically in
immune cells, we also demonstrated that senescent immune cells drive immunological dysfunction and
secondary senescence and pathology in non-lymphoid tissues. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that
senescent cells, including senescent immune cell types, dominantly compromise innate and adaptive immune
cell homeostasis in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs and reactivity to pathogens. Importantly, we also
hypothesize that these adverse effects can be reversed by SnC elimination with senolytics, providing a new
therapeutic strategy to restoring immune function in the aged. We propose to test these hypotheses in our
PPG application entitled “The role of senescent cells in dysregulating immune responses and pathogen
control”, consisting of three collaborative projects and three integrated cores."

Substantial resources have been devoted to policy evaluation of clinical genomic sequencing that hinge on the
conceptualization and measurement of utility. However, most evaluations fail to capture the full utility of
genomic sequencing because they do not account for impact on family members. Pediatrics is a clinical area in
which study of family impact is imperative due to the clinical nature of genetic disorders that manifest in
childhood and the patient-parent-physician decision-making context, in addition to potential identification of
patients’ biologic relatives who may benefit from genetic screening. Although traditional decision science
methods for health economic evaluation produce evidence in the form decision-makers rely upon, they tend to
focus on the individual patient and do not consider the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of testing
for families. Cross-disciplinary effort is necessary integrate ELSI issues that influence clinical implementation
and family preferences using decision science methods for robust modeling and outcomes assessment. This
Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will equip the candidate, a health economist, with expertise in
ELSI in order to conduct innovative research using decision science methodology that integrates ELSI
considerations. The candidate’s career goal is to be a tenure track professor with an independent research
program to meaningfully evaluate the impact of genomic medicine and expand the evidence base for policy
decisions about its implementation. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a clinically relevant and
ELSI-informed model to assess family-level impact of genomic sequencing in the context of pediatric clinical
care. Based in the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine, the candidate will
pursue training in three domains during the mentored phase of the project (K99): (1) ELSI, including qualitative
research methods and normative ethics; (2) pediatric genetics clinical context; (3) advanced decision science
methods, including patient preference elicitation and decision analytic modeling. The training will be applied to
conduct research to better understand the utility of pediatric clinical genomics at the family level by considering
ELSI and family preferences. The specific aims of the research project are: (1) identify relevant attributes and
normative values for family-level evaluation of pediatric genomic sequencing; (2) examine how parents value
those attributes of genomic sequencing using a discrete choice experiment; (3) develop a decision analytic
model of family-level impact of pediatric genomic sequencing to examine its use as a diagnostic tool and
explore the importance of including ELSI and family preferences in utility measures. This project will have high
impact by advancing utility assessment of genomic medicine to better guide clinical and policy decision-
making. Results will inform clinical guidelines, reimbursement strategies, and ethical implementation of
pediatric genomic sequencing to improve patient and population health."
10767265,"Many pathogens grow within host cells by building membrane-bound replication compartments essential for
growth. The compartments provide important protection from host innate immune cytoplasmic surveillance
systems and interfere with trafficking organisms into degradative compartments. Growth in the compartment
is driven by microbial proteins which promote compartment construction, protection against innate immune
surveillance and provide regulatory control over the host cell. How these different arms of the pathogen are
coordinated is poorly understood. A bacterium that uses this strategy is Legionella pneumophila, which
grows in a vacuole within macrophages during pneumonic disease. A group of over 300 Legionella proteins
are translocated into host cells, controlling all aspects of the intracellular lifestyle, including formation of the
replication compartment, blocking host cell translation, and preventing cytosolic recognition of the
replication compartment. The organism hijacks host tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as one of the
earliest steps in replication compartment formation, an event promote by the bacterial Sde proteins.
The proposed studies will test two models for Sde function. First, it will test the model that the Sde proteins
controls ER tubule formation, replication compartment formation, and immune avoidance by promoting a
three-step pathway. Secondly, it will test the model that manipulation of host translation initiation plays a
role in coordinating replication vacuole construction and immune avoidance. The first model proposes that
the Sde deubiquitinase activity liberates free ubiquitin (Ub) from the polyUb on the replication compartment.
This would serve as a pool for ADPribosyltransferase and phosphodiesterase domains to promote Ub
modification of the tubular ER protein Rtn4 and host translation initiation factors (eIFs). In the final step, the
protein family masks the replication compartment with a phosphoribose to prevent recognition by the host
autophagy pathway. The model will be tested by manipulating polyUb pools in the cell, performing electron
microscopy on mutants deranged in this pathway, and reconstructing tubular ER rearrangements in a cell-
free system. To determine the role that targeting of eIF proteins plays in these processes, the targets will be
verified using purified components and the regulated initiation step will be identified. In addition, it will be
determined if eIF proteins are inactivated to remove ribosomes from rough ER and allow close docking of
ER sheets to the replication compartment, and if eIF manipulation skews the host translational response to
favor bacterial replication. Extensive preliminary studies support the proposed experiments, providing a
solid underpinning for this work. Throughout these studies, the objective is to identify a weak link in the
microbial strategy of manipulating ER tubules to promote intracellular growth, with an eye toward
developing antimicrobials that target this process."
10767266,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The goal of the project is to develop a model that explains how decisions are made about information that is
continuously distributed across space, with decisions made on continuous scales. The model will provide a
unified explanation of the full range of decision-making data, including accuracy, the distributions of response
times for correct and incorrect responses, how they change with manipulations of independent variables, and
how they differ among individuals and groups of individuals. The totality of these data will place severe
constraints on the development of the model and its success. The tasks used to test the model will ask
participants to make simple decisions quickly; for example, point to the area on a circle that is the brightest.
Brightness is a continuous scale and responses are made on a continuous scale (the circle). Large,
comprehensive bodies of data will be collected for decision-making in perception, long-term memory, working
memory, and numeracy. Statistical properties of the model will be examined and the numbers of observations
needed will be determined for experiments with clinical patients, children, and other populations for whom the
time for testing must be short.
 Four populations of adults will be studied: young adults, adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), adults
with early Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and older adults who have no cognitive impairments. The aim will be to
understand how normal aging affects individual components of processing in continuous decision-making and
how MCI and early AD affect the components. Almost no research has been conducted with AD and MCI patients
that models the time course of decision-making and no research has been done for decisions made on
continuous response scales about continuously distributed information. It is not known if the components of
decision-making are the same for MCI and AD patients as for unimpaired older adults and it is not known how
independent variables (e.g., the difficulty of a task) affect performance for MCI and AD patients. It is also not
known whether a modeling approach can uncover preserved skills not discernible from accuracy and RT data
alone."

The effects of long-term locus coeruleus stimulation on amyloid/tau pathology, synaptic plasticity, and
memory during Alzheimer’s disease progression
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and accounts for up to 80% of all dementia
diagnoses. Despite the immense burden that AD imposes on society, there is currently no effective method to
prevent or treat AD. Severe degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC) is a ubiquitous hallmark in AD. The LC is
the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) to the whole forebrain and regulates many aspects of normal brain
function. An aberrant form of tau is found in the LC in young healthy adults, making the LC the first region with
AD-like neuropathology in the human brain. Previous work has suggested that NE facilitates the immune-
mediated removal of Aβ through regulation of microglial phagocytosis. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect
of NE has been demonstrated in many studies. Therefore, the LC-NE system is a promising therapeutic target
in AD. However, the consequences of long-term LC stimulation during AD progression remain unknown. In this
project, using a synthesis of chemogenetic manipulation, retrograde Cre-dependent viral ablation,
immunohistology, and behavioral paradigms, we will examine the effects of long-term locus coeruleus
stimulation on amyloid/tau pathology, synaptic plasticity, and memory in Aβ and tau mouse models. In Aim 1,
we will determine the extent to which long term direct LC stimulation delays the deterioration of memory
function and improves synaptic plasticity. In Aim 2, we will characterize the effects of long-term LC stimulation
on amyloid and tau pathology during AD progression. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of non-uniform LC
degeneration in structure-specific amyloid and tau pathology in the brain. This project will provide much-
needed insight about the extent to which long term LC stimulation mitigates amyloid and tau pathology and
rescues memory functions during AD progress. Such information will likely lead to the development of new
therapeutics for AD that utilize both non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation technologies to directly engage
the LC-NE system."

This is a comprehensive mentored research training proposal aimed to support the development of an
independent physician-scientist. The applicant is an Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology & Pediatrics at
Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and is supported by the outstanding facilities, clinical and fundamental
research, and mentorship. The Anesthesiology Department guarantees a 75% protected research time,
indicating institutional priority and ample resources to facilitate the applicant's research and success. This
proposal includes strong preliminary data obtained in the past two years, that have been partially funded by the
applicant's two competitive research awards: The Clayton Award, and funds from the TCH Anesthesiologist-in-
Chief. Based on the multidisciplinary and intersectional research, the applicant has identified six highly
supportive and established scientist mentors. This proposal also outlines an educational plan that includes
coursework, benchwork, and scholarly activities to complete his training and facilitate independence. Pediatric
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), with an incidence of ~7%, has several untoward sequelae, including
neurocognitive dysfunction involving behavior, emotional inhibition, and learning and memory, with unknown
reversibility potentials. This proposal aims to characterize neurocognitive changes using a comprehensive and
translational study approach to develop a novel pre-clinical model of pediatric OSA that faithfully recapitulates
the human phenotype. Using a combination of human polysomnographic and young murine oximetry data we
quantify the neurocognitive changes in pediatric OSA, and in age-matched neonatal mice. This proposal will
test the hypothesis that OSA induces time-dependent reversible changes in postnatal hippocampal
neurobiology, leading to decreased learning capacity. Two aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim
1 will determine the temporal effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on learning and memory in the early
developing brain. Aim 2 will determine the effects of IH on the hippocampus through a) long term synaptic
potentiation in hippocampal slices to interrogate synaptic function, b) identify cell types in the dentate gyrus to
quantify changes, and c) study the synaptic and cellular components of the rescue phenotype. The
significance of these data include: 1) inform surgical decision making based on exposure timing, 2) elucidate
synaptic and cellular data underlying OSA-induced hippocampal injury, and 3) feasibility and determinants of
neurocognitive reversibility. Completion of this 5-year mentored award allows the applicant to combine
perioperative anesthesia practice with an exploration of the molecular mechanisms of OSA-induced
hippocampal damage. It paves the road for an independent physician-scientist committed to informing
improved health targets in children with OSA."
10767838,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a devastating systemic inflammatory syndrome caused by the coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 which has resulted in over 500,000 deaths in the US during the past year, with this high rate of mortality
being attributed in large part to the development of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells requires the direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein to the principal
host protease-TMPRSS2 and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors which are expressed in
multiple host cell types. The development of efficacious vaccines to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents
a tremendous advance that will help curb the COVID-19 pandemic, however the emergence of variants of concern
such as the B1.1.7, P1 and B1.351 which can evade the neutralizing responses of the vaccine-induced humoral
immune response underscores the urgent need to develop novel therapeutics to complement the vaccination efforts.
Based on our provocative Supporting Data, we have formulated the overarching hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2
induced lung endothelial injury is a requisite element of COVID-19 induced maladaptive inflammatory injury that can
be therapeutically targeted. We propose the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will define the nature and underlying
mechanisms of lung endothelial injury underlying COVID-19-induced ALI/ARDS. We will test the hypothesis that the
degree of lung endothelial injury is a key determinant of the overall pathogenicity and mortality of multiple SARS-
CoV-2 variants. We will establish SARS-CoV-2-induced lung vascular injury and compensatory lung endothelial
regeneration using two complementary humanized ACE2 mouse models, EC-specific genetic lineage tracing,
genetic stabilization of VE-cadherin and single cell RNA-Sequencing. In Aim 2, we will define the efficacy and optimal
temporal windows for two targeted pharmacological therapeutic strategies in preventing and resolving SARS-CoV-
2 induced lung endothelial injury. We will test the hypothesis that an engineered soluble hACE-2 peptide has a
higher therapeutic efficacy than the wildtype hACE-2 peptide in reducing lung endothelial injury as well as long-term
EC reprogramming by preventing viral entry and dissemination of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We will test the
corollary hypothesis and that targeted inhibition of IL1β-signaling using a modified IL-1 Receptor antagonist is
protective against the feed-forward inflammatory loop and endothelial injury induced by multiple SARS-CoV2
variants. We will use two hACE-2 mouse models as well as compare distinct routes of delivery (intratracheal versus
intravenous) and identify the optimal temporal windows for the therapeutic intervention."
10767855,"ABSTRACT:
Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge, is associated with multiple adverse
outcomes. The rate of recurrence after therapy is >60% yet BV etiology remains unknown. BV is characterized
by loss of vaginal lactobacilli and increases in facultative (Gardnerella vaginalis) and strict anaerobes. G.
vaginalis, present in 95-100% of BV cases, is more virulent than other BV-associated bacteria in vitro. However,
it is also found in women with normal flora and colonization is not sufficient for BV development.
A notable feature of BV is the appearance of a multi-species bioﬁlm on vaginal epithelial cells containing
abundant G. vaginalis, fewer Atopobium vaginae, and other undefined bacterial species. We hypothesize that
G. vaginalis initiates BV biofilm formation, but incident BV (iBV) requires incorporation of other key bacteria into
the biofilm that alter the transcriptome of the polymicrobial consortium. This is consistent with our finding that,
among women who have sex with women, the mean relative abundance of Prevotella bivia, G. vaginalis, and A.
vaginae became sequentially higher prior to iBV. We propose that a similar distribution of these bacterial species
will increase prior to iBV in women who have sex with men (WSM). Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. Investigate changes in the vaginal microbiota preceding iBV in a longitudinal study of WSM. We
will obtain twice daily vaginal specimens from 150 women with normal vaginal flora (Nugent score 0-3) and follow
them for iBV (Nugent score 7-10 on ≥4 consecutive vaginal specimens) for 60 days. 16S rRNA gene sequencing
targeting V4 [and broad range 16S rRNA gene qPCR] will be done in women for the 14 days prior to iBV as well
as age-comparable women maintaining normal vaginal microbiota.
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of P. bivia to the multi-species BV biofilm in vivo. We will use peptide
nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) probes previously optimized for G. vaginalis and A.
vaginae to analyze BV biofilm formation over time in clue cells from vaginal specimens from women with iBV in
Aim 1, focusing on the 14 days prior to iBV. We will design, validate, and optimize a new P. bivia PNA-FISH
probe for multiplex use (Aim 2A). Light microscopy PNA-FISH will be performed on specimens from women with
iBV and negative controls (Aim 2B). Confocal laser scanning microscopy FISH will be used to determine the
interspatial localization of the 3 bacteria of interest in the BV biofilm on clue cells from women with iBV (Aim 2C).
Aim 3. Identify molecular markers associated with iBV by using RNA sequencing to analyze the
transcriptome of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, and A. vaginae. We will probe specific bacterial interactions during
the 14 days prior to iBV, first by RNA sequencing using in vitro models in a chemically defined medium simulating
vaginal secretions (mGTS) (Aim 3A). Venn-diagram analysis will select the most commonly up-regulated genes
shared in the in vitro assays. The in vivo relevance of potential molecular markers for development of iBV will be
assessed by qPCR, using vaginal samples from women with iBV and negative controls in Aim 1 (Aim 3B)."

Tissue resident macrophages function as essential components of the innate immune system by serving as
sensors and responders to infection and injury. Functional and transcriptomic studies further indicate that
macrophages residing within different tissues are phenotypically distinct and exhibit correspondingly different
programs of gene expression that enable tissue-specific functions. In addition to their immune and homeostatic
functions, resident macrophages and infiltrating monocyte-derived cells also contribute to a diverse array of
metabolic and degenerative human diseases. Studies performed during the last funding cycle of this grant
demonstrated that different tissue environments play instructive roles in promoting distinct macrophage
phenotypes by driving the selection and function of cell specific enhancers. In parallel, studies supported by this
grant leveraged the effects of non-coding natural genetic variation provided by five different strains of mice to
investigate mechanisms controlling bone marrow-derived macrophage specific gene expression in vitro.
Evaluation of the effects of >50 million SNPs and InDels provided evidence for roles of ~100 TFs in shaping
lineage-determining factor binding and gene expression. Here, we propose to advance these genomic and
genetic approaches to identify mechanisms that specify the molecular identities of the resident and recruited
macrophages of the mouse and human liver in health and metabolic disease. Specific Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that local DLL4, BMP/TGFb and desmosterol function in a sequential and combinatorial manner to
drive the selection and activation of Kupffer cell-specific enhancers by regulating RBPJ, SMADS and LXRs,
respectively. Specific Aim 2 will define the network of collaborative transcription factors required for establishing
the Kupffer cell enhancer landscape and quantify cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of natural
genetic variation. Specific Aim 3 will investigate gene by environment interactions that regulate myeloid cell
phenotypes in NASH. Experimental strategies developed in Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be used to test the
hypothesis that myeloid diversity is the consequence of microenvironment-specific combinations of signals that
differentially reprogram the enhancer landscapes of resident Kupffer cells and recruited macrophages. These
studies are expected to lead to the identification of disease- and niche-specific signaling pathways that contribute
to pathological macrophage phenotypes in NASH. Specific Aim 4 will define the transcriptomes and epigenetic
landscapes of myeloid populations in the healthy human liver and across the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease. These studies will establish similarities and differences of human and mouse Kupffer cells, define
effects of genetic variation across individuals, and provide a map of regulatory landscapes of these cells that
can be used for interpretation of non-coding GWAS risk variants."
10780744,"Many bacterial pathogens deploy specialized secretion systems to deliver virulence factors to eukaryotic host
cells or the environment. Type IX secretion system (T9SS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal
pathogen, mediates secretion of extracellular and cell-surface-bound substrates including gingipain proteases.
Our knowledge of T9SS structures has largely derived from X-ray crystallography and single-particle electron
microscopy approaches, which by definition is limited to solving structures of subcomplexes amenable to
isolation and purification. However, revolutionary advances in in situ cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) are
now enabling visualization of T9SS in the native context of the bacterial cell envelope. Drs. Hu and Lamont
have been at the forefront of this work, and we have now visualized the intact T9SS of P. gingivalis in situ.
The T9SS is unique, presenting not as a single functional entity, as do all other known bacterial and eukaryotic
protein transport systems, but rather as a composite of seemingly independent translocation motors and Sov
translocons, arranged symmetrically as distinct rings in the cytoplasm, periplasm, and cell surface.
The long-term objective of our work is to comprehensively define structure & function of the T9SS in
the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis. In this application, we will continue to exploit in situ Cryo-ET
approaches to solve structures of T9SS machines from wild-type and mutant strains, and we will integrate
complementary biochemical and other electron and fluorescence microscopy approaches to add depth to the
Cryo-ET studies and to evaluate the spatial organization of subunits and function of T9SS. In Aim 1, we will
refine the in situ structures at high resolution (10-15 Å) and integrate analyses of mutant machines to map
individual machine subunits. We will seek to determine the PorK/N complex structure at near-atomic
resolution by Cryo-EM. We will also determine the stoichiometry of the Sov translocon by fluorescence
microscopy. Aim 2 will complete ongoing work aimed at identifying structural changes accompanying
activation of the T9SS upon sensing of PMF. We will inhibit energy transduction via mutagenesis of key
residues of the molecular motor PorM/L to detect any structural changes within the T9SS, and define the
interaction domains between PorM and PorKN, which will shed light on the mechanism of energy transduction
from PorM to the PorKN complex. We anticipate that our studies will provide a structural basis for T9SS
mediated translocation of virulence factors and a foundation for development of intervention strategies to
suppress P. gingivalis virulence."

Imbalanced gut microbiome (i.e., dysbiosis) and altered intestinal mucosal immunity are leading factors for
developing several chronic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Proper dietary
patterns can promote healthy microbial community composition, metabolism, and function, thereby preventing
and/or slowing the progression of these diseases. Dietary carotenoids are beneficial food bioactive compounds
for human health. For example, zeaxanthins are essential pigments for macula in the human eye. Low plasma
levels of carotenoids, such as zeaxanthins, are associated with the progression of obesity and T2DM in
humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine the roles zeaxanthin plays in the development of
obesity and T2DM. The Research Project Leader’s preliminary findings in animal models indicate that dietary
zeaxanthins reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-17A), increase colonic goblet cell numbers, and
alter the cecal microbiota composition. Germ-free C57BL/6J (GF) recipient mice gained significantly less
weight and had a decreased elevation of blood glucose levels when colonized with fecal microbiota from
diabetic db/db mice fed a zeaxanthin diet, compared to GF mice receiving fecal microbiota from db/db mice fed
a chow diet. Despite the recent progress outlined above, a substantial knowledge gap regarding the interplay
of dietary zeaxanthin, gut microbiota, and the host intestinal mucosal immunity during the progression of
obesity and T2DM remains. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dietary zeaxanthin effectively
reduces intestinal immune response and inflammation by the gut microbiota. This project’s objective is to
determine the underlying mechanism by which the zeaxanthin diet, gut microbiome, and host intestinal
mucosal immunity interact to prevent the progression of obesity and T2DM through the following two specific
aims: 1) Determine how dietary zeaxanthins modulate intestinal mucosal immunity through the gut microbiome
in the early stages of obesity and diabetes. 2) Determine mechanistically how the gut microbiota alters the
chemistry of dietary zeaxanthins. The results from this research are expected to provide a deeper
understanding of the bidirectional interaction between dietary zeaxanthins and the gut microbiota-immune axis
in regulating gut health and diseases. These studies will also reveal the importance of the interplay of
zeaxanthin-gut microbiota on host intestinal immunity. Thus, this research will significantly impact public health
by advancing our understanding of dietary intervention of carotenoids in these high-risk populations of obesity
and T2DM. Moreover, completing these studies will further empower RPL's program in microbiology and
immunology and ultimately elevate his career to become an independent NIH PI (e.g., with a funded R01)."
10771562,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotics are critical therapeutics for modern medicine, but their frequent misuse has led to the emergence of
multidrug-resistant organisms and can perturb the endogenous microbiome, providing opportunities for
secondary infection by opportunistic pathogens. The long-term goal of this work is to develop novel therapeutics
that are “microbiome safe” by determining how antibiotics and other bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs)
mediate interspecies interactions between commensal bacteria and pathogens in the human microbiome. The
overall objectives in this application are to (i) assess how co-culture with niche-specific pathogens shapes
secondary metabolism in commensal bacteria from the human aerodigestive tract (ADT) and (ii) isolate and
identify SMs with antibiotic activity against pathogens. The central hypothesis is that bacteria in the ADT
modulate their secondary metabolism in response to invading pathogens and produce antibiotics that benefit the
host and microbiome. The rationale for this project is that metabolites produced by symbiotic bacteria are likely
to have been evolutionarily selected for narrow-spectrum activity and to not exert toxic effects on the host or
microbiome. Such metabolites will become leads for the development of new therapeutics. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Assess how pathogen exposure changes secondary
metabolism in commensal ADT bacteria; and 2) Isolate and characterize bioactive SMs produced by ADT
bacteria using genetics and genomics. Under Specific Aim 1, select bacterial genera that have been previously
shown to be rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for SM production will be cultured from nasal and oral
specimens. Co-culture bioassays and comparative metabolomics will be used to assess how exposure to either
ecologically relevant or general pathogens changes SM production in these bacteria. For Specific Aim 2, the
genomes of ADT bacteria that inhibit pathogens in vitro will be sequenced to identify their encoded BGCs. Then,
BGCs associated with bioactivity against pathogens will be identified using comparative genomics and
systematically disrupted. After comparing the metabolite production of ADT bacteria and their isogenic BGC
mutants, molecular features responsible for antibiotic activity will be identified and purified. Mass spectrometry
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used for structural elucidation of these compounds. The
research proposed in this application is innovative because it departs from current approaches to drug discovery
and instead focuses on ecologically relevant interactions to reveal fundamental biology and chemistry of human
ADT microbiomes. The proposed research is significant because it could lead to the discovery of new SMs that
can be developed into narrow-spectrum antibiotics that specifically eliminate pathogens. Ultimately, ecologically
inspired screening of the human microbiome may represent a new and fruitful strategy for drug discovery."

Fluorescent proteins are ubiquitous reagents in the biomedical sciences for reporting gene expression, protein and nucleic
acid localization, cell shape, and cellular activity. However, fluorescent proteins (FPs) become progressively dimmer —
they photobleach — with repeated or prolonged illumination. Photobleaching limits multiple types of biological experiments
where photostability is essential, such as single-molecule biophysics and timelapse imaging of cellular activity during
development, learning, and aging. Photobleaching often cannot simply be addressed by increasing the excitation light, as
high illumination power can induce membrane blebbing, nuclear fragmentation, alterations in the cell cycle, changes to the
concentration of intracellular calcium, and, ultimately, cell death. While over two decades of FP engineering has led to a
toolbox of bright FPs, less attention has been devoted to improving photostability because of the greater difficulty and lower
throughput endured when screening for photostable FPs. Moreover, few studies have attempted to improve photophysical
properties under two-photon illumination — a method of choice for deep-tissue imaging — because of technical challenges
associated with screening under this imaging modality. The overall objective of this research proposal is, therefore, to
develop and apply a color palette of bright and photostable FPs for one- and two-photon imaging in mammalian cells. Our
proposal leverages two specialized and synergistic approaches to FP discovery and engineering: (1) SPOTlight, a new all-
optical screening approach developed in Dr. St-Pierre's lab that circumvents technical hurdles and enables rapid screening
of both brightness and photostability at the single-cell level under one- and two-photon illumination; and (2) transcriptomic
and metagenomic mining for novel FPs from marine invertebrates, a technique pioneered by Dr. Shaner’s lab. SPOTlight
relies on light patterning technology to selectively illuminate individual cells labeled with fluorophores that can be
photoactivated from a dim to a bright state. The cells are therefore tagged with a unique fluorescence signature that can then
be distinguished and retrieved using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). SPOTlight thus enables screening in
dense mixed cultures with single-cell resolution, thereby eclipsing the throughput of traditional well-based approaches.
Mining for novel FPs in marine invertebrate transcriptomes and metagenomes will allow us to rapidly identify and
characterize hundreds of novel FPs. From this pool of new FPs, we will select the most photostable for engineering with
the SPOTlight pipeline. We will also model their structures to guide site-directed mutagenesis. We propose to leverage
these new technologies and assays to develop FPs of different colors that are bright, monomeric, and sufficiently photostable
for long-term imaging experiments. We also propose to apply these new FPs to increase the photostability of genetically
encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), which are fluorescent biosensors whose brightness reports changes in voltage. While
GEVIs are proposing tools for imaging neural electrical activity with exquisite temporal resolution, they require high
illumination power for detection and typically bleach in seconds or minutes. Overall, we anticipate that this project will
produce bright and photostable fluorophores and biosensors of broad utility for illuminating cellular dynamics and that our
procedures will inspire further multi-parameter engineering of imaging probes for long-term imaging."
10773172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive adult primary brain tumor. Regardless of
therapy, the median survival time is less than 15 months as GBM nearly always recurs. Diagnosing GBM
currently depends on acquiring tumor tissue for histologic examination to differentiate GBM from other types of
brain lesions with a similar imaging appearance. Detecting GBM recurrence is also challenging as treatment
effects such as pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis mimic recurrent disease. Thus, risk-associated
diagnostic invasive procedures remain a critical aspect of GBM patient care even though surgically acquired
neurologic deficits may reduce an already short survival time. Therefore, a non-invasive approach to diagnose
GBM and identify true recurrence has the potential to directly impact patient care throughout the entire disease
course. DNA released from cells during programmed cell death, termed cell-free DNA, is an emerging
biomarker for diagnosing human cancers and monitoring response to therapy. Detection of tumor-derived cell-
free DNA in plasma, also known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), has previously been largely unsuccessful
in humans with GBM due to an inability to find the ctDNA amongst the abundant background of normally
occurring cell-free DNA. The large intra- and inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity of GBM has hindered searches
for specific tumor variants in cell-free DNA, while the rarity of GBM to metastasize beyond the central nervous
system has considerably restricted the quantity of ctDNA present. However, our uncovering of ctDNA in a
xenograft brain tumor model using human GBM stem-like cells strongly supports the feasibility of detecting
GBM-derived ctDNA in humans. Moreover, our previous success in the animal model provides direction for the
human translation – reducing or eliminating noise associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) that
interferes with the detection of very low frequency variants is necessary to allow searches for ctDNA that are
not dependent on a priori knowledge of solid tumor variants. In this proposal, we attenuate NGS-related noise
and demonstrate the unbiased detection of GBM-derived ctDNA at time of initial diagnosis and at recurrence.
We also show that identification of GBM solid tumor DNA variants in ctDNA is enhanced by reducing errors
associated with NGS to improve sampling of the solid tumor genetic heterogeneity typical of GBM. Therefore,
this proposal seeks to translate plasma cell-free DNA as a biomarker to detect GBM in humans by suppressing
errors associated with NGS to improve variant detection at very low allele frequencies. The successful
application of ctDNA biomarkers to non-invasively assess GBM will directly affect patient care by enabling the
optimization of clinical management prior to or instead of risk-associated invasive diagnostic procedures."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural and functional support for the myocardium; however, heart
failure alters the composition of the ECM. The ECM is composed of a number of proteins, lipids, and saccharides,
yet their function is largely unknown. We found that one of the most abundant components of the ECM,
hyaluronan (HA), accumulates following myocardial infarction; however, the role of HA following during infarct-
induced heart failure is not known. Fibroblasts are a major cell type involved in ventricular remodeling. Once
activated, fibroblasts proliferate and produce ECM components, such as collagen and HA. These events are
associated with acute scar formation and chronic ventricular remodeling. In this project, I will explore the extent
to which fibroblast-derived HA impacts the extracellular matrix. Specifically, I will study fibroblasts collagen
secretion when HA metabolism is manipulated. Additionally, I will examine the extent to which fibroblast-derived
HA contributes to acute scar formation post-MI. Finally, I will determine the extent to which fibroblast-derived
hyaluronan contributes to chronic ventricular remodeling. We contend that acute increases in HA accumulation
are required for scar formation following acute MI; however, the persistent, excessive production of HA provokes
fibrosis beyond the initial scar. Hence, we predict that HA has a dynamic role following infarct-induced heart
failure: beneficial early and maladaptive late. Taken together, these studies will provide novel insight into the role
of HA in collagen secretion, acure scar formation, and chronic fibrosis. With this fundamental knowledge, we
can, in future studies, explore therapeutic approaches. Regardless of the specific findings of this research plan,
this fellowship will serve as an excellent vehicle to enhance my training so I can eventually become an
independent scientist leading my own research laboratory. The combination of the experimental plan,
experimental tools, my sponsor, the environment, advanced coursework, and professional development
opportunities creates a high likelihood for me to realize my eventual goals and contribute significantly to the
literature in the process."
10773178,"Project Summary/Abstract
This application, “Arterial stiffness, Cognition and Equol (ACE),” is an early stage randomized controlled trial
(RCT) designed to test the effect of a 24-month intervention of 10 mg/day equol supplementation on cognitive
decline, arterial stiffness, and white matter lesions (WMLs) among 400 individuals aged 70+ without dementia.
Recent studies in Japan reported that a diet high in soy and soy isoflavones (ISFs) is inversely associated with
incident cognitive impairment and dementia. The Women’s Isoflavone Soy Health (WISH) in the US, an RCT of
ISFs, however, showed no significant effect of ISFs on cognition. We posit that the discrepant result is due to
the difference in equol-producing capability. Equol, a metabolite of an ISF daidzein transformed by the gut
microbiome, is most bioactive among all ISFs and their metabolites. 50-70% of Japanese convert daidzein to
equol in contrast to 20-30% of Americans. The subgroup analysis of WISH showed that equol producers had
better cognition than the control group, suggesting that equol may slow cognitive decline. In addition, arterial
stiffness, a significant predictor of cognitive decline, is significantly improved in a short-duration RCT of 10
mg/day equol supplementation in middle-aged subjects. Finally, WMLs are a risk factor for age-related
cognitive decline and dementia. We reported a longitudinal association of equol-producing status with WML%
(WML volume normalized to total brain volume) in cognitively normal elderly in Japan. Serum equol levels
were measured using samples collected and stored 6-9 years before the imaging study; 50% were non-equol
producers and equol producers were divided into two groups (high and low). Non-equol producers had
>100% greater WML% than high producers, suggesting that supplementation of equol may slow the
progression of WMLs. No previous study has tested the effect of equol supplementation on cognitive decline,
arterial stiffness or WMLs in older adults. We hypothesize that supplementation of 10 mg/day equol will
significantly slows both cognitive decline (primary outcome), and the progression of arterial stiffness and
WML% (secondary outcomes). The overall impact of our trial will be to determine the role of equol
supplementation in improving cognitive and cerebrovascular outcomes in older adults. Should a positive signal
be identified in this early-stage trial, it would not only lead to a phase 3 trial to test a hypothesis that equol
supplementation reduces risk for cognitive impairment and dementia but also to an RCT of a diet rich in ISFs
between equol producers and non-producers, moving toward a precision health strategy."
10773179,"Abstract The central goal of this proposal is to understand the neural systems subserving the decision to
use the left or right hand1 – a simple choice that is central to our daily functions. Here we focus on parietal
mechanisms of limb selection. Despite it being one of the most common decisions faced in everyday behavior,
a largely neglected aspect of decision making is deciding which hand to use to achieve a goal. For instance,
when deciding which hand to use to flip a light switch upon entering a room, the choice is influenced by many
factors. These factors include what each hand is already doing (e.g, holding a phone), proximity of each hand
to the switch, and future goals (e.g., desire to subsequently pick up an object with a particular hand). Our long-
term goals are to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of limb selection and movement coordination.
Because limb selection is present in most behaviors, this work will provide insights broadly applicable to motor
control. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is known to be involved in the planning and control of actions in an
effector-specific manner. An emerging concept is that the same PPC regions that are involved in movement
preparation and control also participate in action selection. We recently demonstrated that a parietal region
known to contribute to the planning of arm movements and dubbed “the parietal reach region” (PRR), codes
the spatial targets for reaches with the contralateral arm but receives information about the ipsilateral arm from
the opposite hemisphere. PRR has also been implicated in the decision to reach versus saccade to a spatial
target. In our first aim, we characterize limb selection behavior and determine the factors that drive limb
selection. In our second aim we test the hypothesis that PRR is involved in limb selection during unimanual
reaching. Next, we examine interhemispheric communication as a function of limb choice. Finally, we use
reversible inactivation of the callosal fibers connecting PRR in each hemisphere to determine the role of
interhemispheric competition in determining which limb to use. Collectively, these studies will have a broad
impact on the field by illuminating the roles of PPC and callosal connections in a fundamental choice motor
behavior. The results will lay the foundation for future studies that probe the larger bilateral frontoparietal
network involved in movement control. The work may inform rehabilitation approaches for patients with
neurological disorders including stroke and traumatic brain injuries in whom limb use is affected.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with life-long consequences that include paralysis. Central
nervous system (CNS) axons typically fail to regenerate, leading to irreversible losses of neuronal connectivity
and associated functions after injury. SCI is now estimated to cost the nation’s healthcare system around $40.5
billion annually (CDC). People living with paralysis are often unable to afford health insurance that adequately
covers the associated complex secondary or chronic conditions, which places tremendous economic burden and
psychological suffering on them and their families. Developing a drug to treat SCI will address major healthcare
and societal needs.
Encouraging axon regeneration in the CNS is challenged by at least two separate mechanisms that suppress
axonal growth: 1) a lack of intrinsic regenerative capacity in adult CNS neurons, and 2) the extrinsic inhibitory
microenvironment confronting damaged axons. Despite decades of research and billions of NIH dollars spent,
there are still no approved drugs for promoting axon regeneration. Moreover, the effectiveness of drugs in
development is likely limited by the fact that each targets only one of the two growth-suppressive mechanisms.
We have discovered the first therapeutic candidate, in the form of a small molecule, which can simultaneously
address both sources of regeneration failure. We accomplished this using a combination of phenotypic
screening, target-based profiling, and machine learning to identify kinase targets within each of the two
mechanisms, extrinsic and intrinsic. We then identified a single small molecule (RO48) that manifests a
polypharmacology profile correlated with unusually robust promotion of axon growth. Remarkably, RO48 showed
high and reproducible efficacy in multiple animal models of SCI. We performed preliminary structure activity
relationship (SAR) studies on RO48 with three main motivations: 1) preliminary investigation of the SAR and hit-
to-lead feasibility, 2) improving the potency of RO48 in cell-based assays, and 3) generation of new composition
of matter IP to permit drug development. We were successful in demonstrating SAR and feasibility, as well as
generating new IP (International Patent Application No. PCT/US18/58411, inventors: Al-Ali et al.). Preliminary in
vitro and in vivo DMPK/Tox studies revealed that our chemistry efforts thus far have already eliminated several
liabilities of RO48. In this project, we aim to finalize the SAR studies and generate four lead candidates for animal
testing. We will then prioritize one lead to advance towards a Phase I clinical trial."

The COVID-19 public health emergency gave an extraordinary exogenous shock to SUD treatment
organizations, forcing rapid changes in how they provide care. Before COVID-19, the treatment model relied
heavily on brick-and-mortar clinics to provide in-person medical care and psychosocial treatment, including
specialty outpatient addictions treatment (SOAT) and pharmacotherapy provided through medical office-based
addictions treatment (OBAT). Due to government mandates for physical distancing and relaxation of
restrictions for using telehealth, both SOAT and OBAT providers quickly and fundamentally changed their
workflows, including: new forms of medical screening and medication management; greater flexibility in
allowing patient self-dosing of medication at home; treatment through individualized and group meetings via
telehealth; reduced reliance on drug use screening; and new strategies for treatment engagement. These
changes will have unknown effects on treatment retention, use of pharmacotherapy for addictions, and longer-
term outcomes. The outpatient treatment system responses—both temporary and enduring—to these external
shocks will take many forms depending on the organizational and environmental context in which programs
operate. There is concern that Black/African American and Latinx patients—who are more likely to receive care
in more poorly resourced programs and have lower access to eHealth technology—will receive poorer quality
care and worse outcomes. We will employ a social-ecological framework to examine the conditions under
which outpatient treatment across New York State adapted to the exogenous shock and analyze relationships
between new clinical practices (e.g., use of telehealth) and proximal (e.g., retention, use of pharmacotherapy)
and distal (e.g., overdoses, emergency department visits) markers of patient outcomes. Further, we will
examine racial/ethnic variation that may indicate disparities in care as well as organizational and community
factors that may account for disparities. We propose an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to study
both short term and longer-term changes to treatment services and outcomes. We will first use administrative
data—joining a state registry of SUD treatment episodes with Medicaid—to study variation in treatment
practices across 545 SOAT clinics and 3100 OBAT providers. We will examine changes to treatment practice:
clinical delivery (e.g., use of telehealth, mix of group versus individual counseling), use of pharmacotherapy
(e.g., remote induction, greater flexibility in methadone self-administration), and retention. We will then
examine the association between these practice changes and treatment outcomes, such as overdoses,
substance-related emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. We will employ qualitative methods to
develop an understanding of the quantitative findings by examining organizational characteristics of programs
representative of those that have best retention and treatment outcomes as well as programs that performed
worst on these measures. The findings will inform clinical and policy decisions on treatment system reforms."
10773183,"Extracellular mitochondria transfer in gray and white matter for ameliorating sensorimotor and
 cognitive deficits after stroke
Mitochondrial function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). It
is now recognized that mitochondria are surprisingly released and transferred between cells. However, the
underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this proposal, we will investigate post-translational
modification by O-GlcNAc as a critical element for extracellular mitochondrial functionality and the transfer-
mediated blood-brain barrier recovery, oligodendrocyte protection and neural plasticity after stroke.
Our pilot data suggest that (i) ER-Golgi trafficking may regulate mitochondrial protein O-GlcNAcylation, (ii)
transfer of O-GlcNAcylated mitochondria may protect neurons, oligodendrocyte precursors and endothelial
cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation, (iii) blockade of DJ1 O-GlcNAcylation may increase mitochondrial
glycation and degradation, thus reducing the protective capacity of extracellular mitochondria, (iv) levels of
mitochondrial O-GlcNAc-DJ1 may be positively correlated with functional recovery after stroke and negatively
correlated with aging, (v) methods to dissect these mechanisms (molecular tools, optical imaging,
electrophysiology, snRNA-seq etc) are feasible in our collaborating labs.
Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) or CD31 signals
upregulate CD38 in reactive astrocytes, and CD38-driven post-translational modification by O-GlcNAc supports
extracellular mitochondrial functionality that accelerates viable mitochondrial transfer-mediated neurovascular
remodeling and remyelination, thus ameliorating sensorimotor deficits and post-stroke dementia after stroke.
We have 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect mechanisms of O-GlcNAc-modified mitochondrial release
and transfer between astrocytes and neurons or brain endothelial cells or OPCs/oligodendrocytes. In Aim 2,
we will investigate O-GlcNAcylated mitochondrial transfer in gray matter and white matter in young, older, male
or female mice after focal ischemia. In Aim 3, we will use gain- and loss-of-function experiments to modify
mitochondrial protein O-GlcNAcylation, and assess sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes in vivo. Our
experiments will utilize molecular tools including a combination of pharmacologic activators/inhibitors, site-
directed mutagenesis, and AAV-induced mitochondrial labeling to assess astrocyte-specific mitochondria
transfer. Single-nuclei RNA seq will be performed to fully map transcriptomes in gray and white matter post-
stroke. Translational relevance will be assessed with in vivo imaging, electrophysiology and long-term
outcomes post-stroke. This project should define a novel mechanism of mitochondrial transfer in both gray and
white matter, and hopefully provide new approaches to accelerate sensorimotor recovery and ameliorate post-
stroke vascular-related dementia."

include 1) innovative recruitment strategies targeted to colleges, universities, and national meetings having a
large constituency of UR undergraduate students including hosting an applicant preview weekend and
networking with MUSC PREP program colleagues, 2) courses to address changes in the biomedical research
landscape including bioinformatics/big data, 3) individualized career track training such as accelerate to
academia (A2A), accelerate to industry (A2i), entrepreneurship, teaching and community
engagement/government/policy intramural and extramural programs, 4) career development workshops and
guidance on writing and submitting grant proposals led by a group of faculty dedicated to their success, 5)
promotion of community/cross-disciplinary interactions/leadership via involvement in summer undergraduate

on-one coffee socials, and personalized coaching program, 7) promotion of self-efficacy through recognition of
IMSD scholars’ accomplishments at various platforms and motivational/wellness challenges, and 8) facilitation
of career networking of IMSD scholars by supporting them to give talks at their undergraduate institutions,
attend national meetings and a yearly symposium of PREP and IMSD-containing institutions, and an annual
retreat with an invited speaker. Internal and external advisory committees will provide oversight for the

10747319,"Exaggerated emotional reactivity, impaired social function, aberrant regulation of defense behaviors, and
autonomic dysregulation are a constellation of debilitating symptoms that are present in a range of anxiety
disorders. Anxiety disorders, as a group, impact about 20% of the US population and treatments for anxiety
disorders are only partially effective and often associated with side effects. While most attention has focused
on fronto-limbic circuitry, a current gap in knowledge is the contribution of hindbrain circuits. A second major
gap is how hindbrain and forebrain sites interact. Moreover, the vast majority of circuit-level characterization
has occurred in rodent models, which leads to the third major gap in knowledge: the functional organization of
these circuits in non-human primates. Indeed, as evidenced by findings in our lab and by others, the primate
brain is organized in often surprisingly different manners than the rodent brain. Thus, understanding the
organization of these circuits in the primate brain is essential to understanding the organization of the human
brain. We have previously found that acute disinhibition of the deep layers of the superior colliculus (DLSC), a
midbrain structure, by focal infusions of the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, precipitated a state of exaggerated
defensive and emotional reactivity (DER). Concurrent inhibition of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) reduced
some but not all of the defense responses, suggesting differential circuitry underlying individual components of
the defensive response. In this application, we propose to determine the circuit architecture by which hindbrain
(DLSC, PAG) and forebrain (BLA, central nucleus of the amygdala, pulvinar) regions interact to produce
defensive emotional reactions, unconditioned fear, dysregulation of social behavior, and autonomic arousal. In
the two proposed specific aims, we will test the hypotheses that induced inhibition of the limbic components will
attenuate the DER evoked from the midbrain structures and that induced inhibition of midbrain structures will
attenuate the DER evoked from the forebrain. Using MRI-guided intracerebral microinfusions, we will
transiently activate and inactivate components of this network and determine the resulting impact on anxiety-
relevant behavioral responses. Following these experiments, we will employ anatomical tracer techniques to
characterize projection pathways of interest. We will also perform validation experiments using Designer
Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), which have grown in use in rodents, but
remain rarely used in primates, to help move this translational technology forward. We expect that our data will
have implications for understanding the pathology of anxiety disorders."
10747321,"ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts millions of Americans each year and can lead to cognitive dysfunction,
difficulty with sensory processing, sleep disruption, and the development of epilepsy. One common neural
outcome of TBI is the development of electrophysiological abnormalities that can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy
(PTE) or disruptions in sleep architecture. However, the mechanisms by which these neurological deficits arise
as a consequence of TBI remain poorly understood.
Preliminary evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to the electrophysiological abnormalities that
underlie PTE and sleep disruption in a mouse model of moderate TBI. Indeed, TBI is characterized by both the
activation of glial cells like astrocytes and microglia and by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells like
monocyte-derived macrophages and T-cells. While neuroinflammation occurs immediately in the cortical region
of acute injury, secondary neuroinflammation develops slowly in the ipsilateral thalamus, presumably as a
result of loss of intimate reciprocal connections between cortex and thalamus. Because the cortico-thalamo-
cortical (CTC) circuit plays a key role in cognition, sleep, and seizures, which are all impacted by TBI, the
delayed neural plasticity in this circuit is a good model for teasing apart the interaction between the immune
cells and neural circuits after TBI.
The role of peripheral immune cells is particularly understudied in the context of TBI-derived
electrophysiological deficits like PTE and sleep disruption. We propose to use a controlled-cortical impact
mouse model of moderate TBI to determine the role of delayed infiltration of monocyte-derived
macrophages and CD4+ T cells in secondary neuronal loss (Aim 1), excitation/inhibition imbalance in the
cortico-thalamic circuit (Aim 2), and the development of electrographic abnormalities such as sleep disruption
and PTE (Aim 3). To do so, we will combine cutting-edge tools from both neuroscience and immunology,
including genetic manipulations, flow cytometry, 3D imaging of immune-neural interactions, synaptic physiology
in brain slices, and chronic wireless EEG recordings.
Funding of this study will enable us to better understand how the immune system interacts with neural circuits
after TBI to cause the development of neurological deficits. Given that there are treatments already available in
clinic to block CD4+ T cells and macrophages, this study has the potential to rapidly impact how TBI is treated

The need for more precise nutrition advice is widely recognized, yet specific differences in genetic, epigenetic,
microbiome and phenotypic drivers of individual variability to diet are not well known. The National Institutes of
Health initiative to fund Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH), powered by the All of Us Research Program, will
enable major progress in the field of precision nutrition. Here we propose Nutrition for Precision Health: The
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Clinical Center (UNC-CC). Because chronic inflammation
promotes the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular,
neoplastic, and neurodegenerative disorders, we draw upon the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet as a viable
strategy to improve systemic inflammation and reduce risk for many chronic diseases and their complications. A
body of literature has emerged that demonstrates both genotypically- and phenotypically-driven differential
responses to the Mediterranean diet relative to a range of outcomes. Our proposal will address the critical
need to understand variability in physiologic responses to diet, anchored by the theme of
inflammation. We emphasize inclusion of a highly diverse sample facilitated by two clinical locations with
metabolic kitchens: the UNC Nutrition Research Institute (UNC-NRI) in Kannapolis, NC, and the Chapel Hill
campus of UNC (UNC-CH). The UNC-NRI draws from relatively rural communities, and UNC-CH draws from
relatively urban communities, both with a substantial proportion of people of color. Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. To participate actively in the Year 1 planning process and beyond, engaging across the NPH
consortium to collaboratively develop and execute the final study protocol.
Aim 2. To execute NPH Module 1. Following participant enrollment into All of Us, we will enroll and complete
the Module 1 protocol for a total of 2,000 NPH participants (25% at UNC-NRI; 75% at UNC-CH), including two
study visits with a 2-week remote data capture period and a mixed meal challenge test.
Aim 3. To execute NPH Module 2. A subset of 500 Module 1 participants will complete a free-living, controlled
feeding study of three 2-week diet intervention periods, separated by 3-week washout periods. Diets include: the
Mediterranean diet adapted for the US (Med-USA; 40% fat calories, 40% carbohydrate), the Med-USA modified
for high healthy fat content (60% fat calories, 20% carbohydrate), and Med-USA modified for high healthy
carbohydrate content (20% fat calories, 60% carbohydrate). Differential effects of the diets on outcomes
comprising inflammatory markers and metabolic parameters from the mixed meal challenge will be tested across
genotypic and phenotypic subgroups, focusing on weight status, age, and diabetes status.
The UNC-CC team brings impressive interdisciplinary strength in nutrition (basic science to public health)
and has the capacity and experience in complex, multi-site trials to ensure the scientific rigor needed to execute
this study. Results will generate predictive algorithms to inform individualized dietary guidance to improve health."
10747338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Establishment of New York University (NYU) Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) is proposed in
response to RFA-AI-18-046 entitled “Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) (UM1 Clinical Trial
Required)”. NYU VTEU will be one of the 10 fixed sites that will participate in the NIAID Infectious Diseases
Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). Within the consortium, this NYU VTEU will work closely with NIAID, the
Leadership Group (LG), other VTEUs, and NIAID-supported research resources.
The broad, long-term objective of NYU VTEU is to protect and restore human health through clinical trials of
innovative medical countermeasures to combat microbial threats. While major advances in vaccines and
antimicrobial agents have resulted in large reductions in morbidity and mortality, emerging and re-emerging viral
threats (e.g., Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS, Nipah, dengue) and widespread antimicrobial drug resistance threaten
to reverse these gains. Furthermore, we remain without broadly effective vaccines against the major infectious
disease killers: tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS. A better seasonal influenza vaccine and ultimately a universal
influenza vaccine are needed, as evidenced by 80,000 US flu deaths during the 2017-18 season. Working with
NIAID and LG, NYU VTEU will review, refine and implement the infectious diseases clinical research agenda.
As per RFA-AI-18-046, the initial IDCRC priority research areas include: sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
malaria and neglected tropical diseases, respiratory infections, enteric diseases, and emerging infections. The
medical countermeasures to be studied include: vaccines, biologics, therapeutics, biomarkers with predictive
value, devices, and diagnostics.
NYU VTEU team has extensive expertise and experience with these priority infectious diseases and
countermeasures. When high priority pathogens need to be addressed quickly, NYU VTEU has demonstrated
experience in rapid responsiveness and surge capacity - critical elements of the optimal VTEU. Importantly, in
order to speed the development of needed vaccines, an inpatient research unit for controlled human infection
model (CHIM) studies has been developed at NYU VTEU. NYU School of Medicine comprises seven major
hospitals. The diverse patients cared for in these hospitals and associated clinics (8.4 million outpatient visits
and 144,000 inpatient admissions in 2018), along with the large diverse NYC population of 8.6 million (largest
city in US), are ideal for recruitment of patients with specific conditions and healthy individuals."
10915580,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite increased awareness and provision of resources, there remain significant disparities in the
demographics of the workforce in science, engineering, technology, and mathematics, medicine (STEMM).
These disparities are the result of a “leaky pipeline” in which there is attrition of certain historically under-
represented groups at each stage of training and career advancement. In 2019-2020, 71% of doctoral degrees
in STEMM fields were awarded to individuals who were categorized as White race and ethnicity. In 2019,
although a higher number of women obtained a doctoral degree in a STEMM field compared to men, more than
twice as many people employed in management or higher positions in the same fields were male compared to
female. Prior studies showed that diversity within teams has many benefits, including innovation and strong
information processing. Several conceptual frameworks have identified social supports that are mediated by
enhanced self-efficacy and scientific identity to improve persistence to pursue a career in a STEMM field. Career
development programs that offer evidence-based interventions that are rooted in these empirical models may
be an individual-level approach to increase representation of historically under-represented groups in biomedical
sciences. The purpose of this project, in partnership with NIDDK, is to offer a career development program to
early career trainees who are funded by NIDDK grants. We hypothesize that, over five years, program scholars
will report a strong sense of belonging and self-efficacy in the field; sustain and advance in their current career
trajectory; and obtain the next appropriate level of funding to establish their independent program of research.
The potential impact of this project is increased representation of early- and mid-career researchers from
historically under-represented groups conducting research relevant to the priority areas of NIDDK. Specifically,
this project targets individuals who are at the transition from culmination of training or early career investigators
to established researcher. The long-term potential implications include the potential to realize both direct benefits
for program scholars as well as broader indirect effects for future researchers"
10786060,"Abstract:
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment for many patients with
hematological disease. A lack of understanding of how hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors engraft in the
regenerating marrow hampers the development of new therapies to improve transplantation efficiency,
especially when donor stem cells are limiting. A major limitation for progress was the lack of tools to examine
differentiation in situ. We have developed methods to image and fate map virtually all steps of blood cell
production in situ. The objective of this proposal is to generate an atlas of hematopoietic cell engraftment and
determine how the local microenvironment promotes engraftment.
We have found that different subsets of sinusoids and megakaryocytes identify physically distinct regions of
high or poor donor cell engraftment. We hypothesize that regions of high donor cell engraftment represent
progenitor niches that selectively promote short-term engraftment. In contrast areas of low donor cell
engraftment represent stem cells niches that promote clonal stem cell renewal and long-term engraftment.
We will test this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1 we will generate an imaging atlas of regenerative
hematopoiesis and test the hypothesis that progenitors and stem cells differentially localize to different bone
marrow regions. In Aim 2 we will investigate the mechanisms through which unique niches in the regenerating
microenvironment support regenerative hematopoiesis."
10786061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 1.5 billion people are infected with helminths worldwide, predominantly distributed in tropical and
subtropical areas. On the other hand, in developed countries with markedly reduced infectious diseases, there
is a continuing increase in the incidences of allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. The hygiene
hypothesis proposes that an under-stimulated immune system resulting from the absence of exposure to
helminths, predisposes to autoimmune and allergic inflammation. There is an urgent need for new preventive
and therapeutic medicines for mucosal infection and inflammation. The research in my laboratory has been
focused on the pathophysiological role of O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification on intracellular
proteins at serine and threonine residues. The long-term goal is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and
physiological functions of O-GlcNAc signaling in intestinal homeostasis and mucosal host defense. In the
proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), by activating STAT6 signaling,
promotes the differentiation of IL-25-producing tuft cells and facilitates IL-33 secretion from goblet cells, thus
evoking type 2 immune responses for tissue repair and inflammation control. In Aim 1, we seek to define the
functional impact, upstream activating signals, and downstream targets of STAT6 O-GlcNAcylation in tuft cell
differentiation, type 2 immune activation, and helminth expulsion. In Aim 2, we identify a novel, common target
of OGT and STAT6 that colocalizes with IL-33 in goblet cells and mediates the unconventional secretion of IL-
33 to initiate type 2 immune responses. In Aim 3, using pharmacological and genetic approaches to increase
global protein O-GlcNAcylation in the intestinal epithelium, we expect to establish that the OGT-STAT6 pathway
is required for intestinal homeostasis and mediates the therapeutic effect of helminths in colitis. The proposed
study will provide valuable insights into the development of new intervention strategies to eradicate parasitic
worms in areas of poverty in the developing world and to treat inflammatory bowel disease in industrialized
countries."
10932225,"PROJECT SUMMARY
About 100,000 people die annually in the U.S. because of opioid overdose or complications of opioid use disorder
(OUD). Three medications for OUD (MOUD) are FDA-approved and regularly used to treat OUD: methadone,
buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). However, persons who use opioids, including those
prescribed MOUDs, report sleep disruption. In addition to the sleep centers of the brain, mu opioid receptors
(MORs) are also expressed in the retina (including the human retina), specifically in ganglion cells that are
critically important for non-image forming photoreception including circadian regulation of sleep-wake behavior.
Pre-clinical studies show that activation of MORs on these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
(ipRGCs) reduces the electrophysiological response to light, impacting critical ipRGC functions such as
synchronization of sleep-wake behavior and circadian rhythms to light (photoentrainment), light-induced
melatonin suppression, and the post-illumination pupillary reflex (PIPR). Together, these results suggest that
activation of MORs in the ipRGCs by opioid use and/or MOUDs may impair downstream ipRGC functions. This
multi-disciplinary study will examine the novel overarching hypothesis that persistent alterations in sleep/wake
behavior in OUD patients undergoing treatment are mediated by impaired ipRGC function, and biomarkers of
this pathway can predict recovery and relapse. Three aims will be tested in a sample of 200 participants, 150 of
whom will be engaged in MOUD therapy (e.g., 50 each on methadone, buprenorphine, and XR-NTX,
respectively) and 50 of whom will be non-opioid using control participants. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
MOUD differentially impacts function of ipRGC responses. Aim 2 will examine whether MOUD differentially
impacts daytime sleepiness, daily sleep-wake behavior, sleep architecture, and sleep-disordered breathing.
Finally, Aim 3 will determine if ipRGC function predicts opioid relapse among MOUD groups at 1-, 3- and 6-
month follow-up. Compared to non-opioid using controls or persons receiving an opioid antagonist (XR-NTX),
we predict that participants who are receiving an agonist (methadone) or partial-agonist (buprenorphine) MOUD
will have the most ipRGC interference, as evidenced by reduced PIPR, attenuated light-induced melatonin
suppression, reduced circadian rhythmic amplitude, increased sleep latency, and increased sleep fragmentation.
Importantly, we hypothesize that impaired ipRGC function will predict worse treatment outcomes as indicated by
opioid use by 6-month follow-up. Finally, an exploratory aim will examine whether the MOUD groups show
different relationships between opioid craving/withdrawal symptoms and sleep-wake behavior over a 10-day
assessment of the participants’ daily lives within the normal environment. The results of this study will be highly
significant because it would support the use of the pupillary response to light and other indicators of ipRGC
function as novel biomarkers to predict the response and outcomes to MOUDs."
10784249,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a severe neurodegenerative disease of aging that usually leads to
death within 5-7 years of diagnosis. There are no effective treatments for PSP, but therapeutic approaches being
tested in clinical trials for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis may be even more promising for PSP. Despite excellent feasibility of large multicenter PSP clinical
trials, there are few new studies, limiting options for patients to access experimental therapies and severely
delaying the identification of effective treatments. New, efficient clinical PSP trial programs and focused efforts
to identify PSP biomarkers are urgently needed. The overarching goal of the PSP Trial Platform (PTP) is to
conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 platform trial in mild-moderate PSP that will simultaneously
test at least three different tau-related or neuroprotective therapies to determine safety, tolerability and clinical
proof of concept based on a multimodal clinical rating scale, the modified PSP Rating Scale-15 (mPSPRS-15).
Platform trials create economies of scale through generation of a common clinical trial protocol and the ability to
share placebo group information to allow a greater number of therapies to be tested in a shorter amount of time
and with less expense than multiple independent clinical trials. Three therapies will be compared for 12 months,
in four parallel arms, with a 3:1 (drug:placebo) randomization ratio to encourage recruitment, followed by an
optional, 12-month open-label extension. Key inclusion criteria will be a diagnosis of mild-moderate PSP, with
symptoms < 5 years in duration, preserved ability to ambulate with minimal cognitive impairment (Mini Mental
State Exam > 25). All individuals will be screened with a validated MRI diagnostic tool to rule out non-PSP
etiologies. Using these criteria, we estimate that 110 participants per group (3 drug, 1 placebo) will be necessary
to have 80% power to detect a 33% slowing in decline on the mPSPRS-15 over 12 months, accounting for 20%
attrition. Key secondary endpoints will include including changes in the total PSPRS, activities of daily living
(Schwab and England ADL), global status (Clinical Global Impression of disease severity), the PSP Quality of
Life scale, a newly validated PSP Cognitive Composite, and volumetric MRI biomarkers including midbrain
volume. Exploratory CSF biomarker discovery efforts will focus on changes in PSP-associated tau fragments,
axon guidance network proteins, and lysosomal proteins and lipids over 12 months. Leveraging the experience
and resources of the CurePSP Centers of Care, the Parkinson’s Study Group, the NIH-funded ALLFTD research
network, and the NIH AD Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC), we propose to enroll 440 participants at ~50 sites
in North America over 24 months. Like other platform trials, additional therapeutic arms may be added after initial
program launch. If successful, the PTP will provide key data for decision-making about which therapies to pursue
in larger efficacy trials, create a new infrastructure to efficiently evaluate PSP therapies, and a new resource for
longitudinal PSP clinical and biomarker data, and biosamples, to be shared with other researchers."

Hippocampus is important for spatial memory. The prototypical neurophysiology is place cells一neurons that
are active at particular places in the environment (place fields). Collectively, place cells are thought to form
cognitive maps, an internal representation of the environment (i.e. spatial memory). Mechanistic models have
made predictions about the pattern of neural connectivity underlying cognitive maps. However, experimental
data of circuit structures are difficult to obtain, because neuronal arbors with synapses at nanometer scale are
densely packed in neuropils that span a millimeter or more in extent even for local circuits. Volume electron
microscopy is currently the only approach that can densely map neural connectivity at synaptic resolution
(connectomics). I have been trained in high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques in
PhD, and more recently, I have developed an imaging pipeline with four current fastest TEMs. I will use
serial-section TEM imaging followed by circuit reconstruction to map local connectivity in hippocampus.
Furthermore, I will combine two-photon calcium imaging of neural activity during spatial navigation and EM
reconstruction on the same neurons (functional connectomics), to relate place fields of neurons to the
underlying neural circuits in the hippocampus. The goal is to experimentally test long-standing predictions on
patterns of neural connectivity by theoretical models: place cells with neighboring place fields are preferentially
connected with each other. Towards these goals, in my postdoctoral training I will develop methods to register
functionally imaged cells to the same cells in EM-reconstructed volume in the hippocampus and be exposed to
deep learning EM reconstruction approach. The training will take place in Princeton Neuroscience Institute,
under the guidance of Drs. David Tank and Sebastian Seung. With these skills, my goal is to develop an
independent research program of applying functional connectomic methods to relate circuit structure and
function in the hippocampus."

The Baylor College of Medicine Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (BCM-IMSD) aims to enhance
the training and increase the numbers and success of underrepresented (UR) scientists trained at the
Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Baylor College of Medicine. BCM has made significant advances
in educating UR scientists, having graduated more than 13 UR PhDs and MD/PhDs every year for the past 5-
years. Since 1998, 165 under-represented students have received PhDs. Many BCM-IMSD alums have
excellent records of achievement and productivity equivalent to non-UR trainees at BCM, positioning them for
leadership roles in the biomedical research community. Of equal importance, 95% of IMSD-funded and 90% of
all UR alums are currently active in a research-related field. The BCM UR and non-UR alums are becoming
post-docs, residents, and fellows at research-intensive institutions and research-related industries. The overall
goal is to maximize the development and productivity of every UR trainee using activities provided through the
BCM-IMSD to enhance the generation of a top-notch and diverse STEM workforce across the United States.
The IMSD UR students receiving local, national, and international awards have increased dramatically since
1998 to more than 300 awards, including national fellowships. Our alums are progressing in their careers in
science or professions where they use their scientific training. We propose to continue recruiting, retaining, and
graduating UR scientists trained at BCM to diversify the biomedical workforce by focusing their minds on
innovative approaches and experiences to build knowledge to decrease morbidity and mortality and improve
the health of our diverse national population. We will enhance UR graduate education by supporting students'
technical, operational and professional skills development to work at state-of-the-art research laboratories and
core facilities at BCM. We will use evidence-informed educational and mentoring practices to build an
inclusive, safe and supportive research environment, provide community building, and recruit faculty trained in
culturally aware mentoring, Entering Mentoring (and Entering Research for students) established by the
National Mentoring Research Network. The BCM-IMSD activities that will increase retention and decrease time
to a degree include: building a supportive community, tutoring, academic success workshops, faculty and peer-
to-peer mentoring, writing workshops, scientific conference participation, support for fellowship writing and
grantsmanship, acquiring teamwork skills through team-based science series developed at BCM, and
innovative educational experiences to support the development and career management for student success."

Project Summary:
 The Specific Aim of this Direct to Phase II project is to develop a discrete, low-profile, dual
hormone artificial pancreas device, the GeminiTM-DHAP, using SFC Fluidics' enabling
microfluidic technologies to deliver both insulin and glucagon as recommended by a dual-hormone
algorithm in response to continuous glucose monitor readings. The Gemini pod uses one
proprietary DualPumpTM body to independently and accurately deliver both insulin and glucagon
from two separate reservoirs. Safety valve sets independently and safely control the delivery of
each hormone, and a dispense confirmation sensor notifies the user of any dosing errors resulting
from occlusions or electrical/mechanical failures. Phase II will focus on optimization and design
freeze of the Gemini pod followed by integration of the Gemini pod with a CGM and dual-hormone
algorithm into a DHAP system and extensive benchtop and animal model testing. The project will
culminate with an IDE submission in preparation for future clinical trials. Throughout the project
SFC will collaborate with its university subcontractors, established medical, regulatory and
manufacturing consultants, GMP-compliant pod component manufacturing partner, and the Food
and Drug Administration to streamline commercialization of the Gemini-DHAP. By the end of
Phase II, SFC Fluidics will be well positioned to raise the additional funding necessary for early-
stage clinical trials and subsequent pivotal trials to obtain PMA-approval of the Gemini-DHAP.
This project is in direct response to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases for “development of
improved insulin and other pancreatic hormone delivery devices and methods” and is particularly
relevant in 2023 due to the increased risk for Covid 19 and other infections that results from poor
glycemic control."
10759368,"Nearly one in three older veterans have multi-morbidity, many of whom manage life-limiting conditions
(LLC) and may benefit from palliative care (PC).1,2 A PC consultation is an opportunity to review care goals and
manage complex medical and psychosocial needs for veterans with LLCs. PC improves quality of life and
quality of end-of-life (EOL) care; however, most research has been conducted in the inpatient setting.3-7 In
2009, the VA Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative established Palliative Care Consult Teams (PCCT)
with infrastructure investments largely in inpatient settings. In 2013, VA Geriatrics and Extended Care began
expanding outpatient PC (OPC) services. Despite increasing use of OPC in the VA, little is known about the
implementation and effectiveness of OPC in the VA. Preliminary evidence suggests OPC consults may be
effective in patients with certain LLCs; however, effects are heterogeneous across potentially eligible patients.
To improve appropriate PC use, critical gaps include lack of knowledge about OPC patterns (OPC consult
characteristics and timing relative to inpatient PC, hospitalization, death) and PCCT structural characteristics
and care practices. This project will generate the foundational knowledge needed to support an IIR proposal to
compare effectiveness of OPC models and evaluate under what conditions OPC improves Veteran outcomes.
 My CDA employs an explanatory sequential design starting with quantitative analyses of OPC reach and
patterns of use (aim 1) followed by enhanced interpretation using qualitative data (aim 2) and together these
findings will inform the development of a site-level survey measuring PCCT structural characteristics and OPC
practices (aim 3). Veteran engagement will include additional discussions with the local Veteran engagement
board, and an advisory board (with representatives from the Veteran Engagement Board), ensuring this research
is integrated with operational and veteran priorities. Aim 1.1 uses CDW data to Identify and describe common
OPC patterns among aging veterans with LLC. Aim 1.2 will evaluate veteran- and site-level predictors of OPC
patterns and identify sites with high and low OPC reach to inform Aim 2. Through interviews with PCCT members
and leadership (n=18-24), Aim 2 will characterize OPC patterns and perceived organizational determinants of
OPC reach, applying PRISM constructs from the Organizational Perspective domain. Themes will be compared
between 3 high and 3 low reach sites. Aim 3 will adapt and pilot a recent GEC survey for Home Based Primary
Care (HBPC) to collect data in 5 domains: structure/resources, leadership/team characteristics, referral
workflows, patient groups served, and care components. Finally, Aim 4 will evaluate health services use
associated with OPC consult and how outcomes differ across common OPC patterns.
 My CDA will culminate in the development and dissemination of a Palliative Care Pathways report that
describes common patterns, sequencing, and outcomes of OPC in the VA in years 4-5. The IIR will implement
the survey developed in the CDA and use these data to support a comparative effectiveness study of OPC
using mixed methods. This evidence generated by the proposed research program is needed to identify
strategies for tailoring PCCT to local needs and resources while retaining fidelity to the components that will
improve appropriate PC use for veterans with LLC. Using this knowledge, we will work with operational
partners to identifying opportunities for system redesign to improve veterans’ quality of life and families’
satisfaction with EOL care."
10760218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-dipping type of nocturnal blood pressure (BP) is common even among treated hypertensives and is
associated with a nearly two-fold higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Obesity impacts nearly 40%
of American adults, and obese individuals have a high prevalence of hypertension and non-dipping type of
nocturnal BP. The natriuretic peptides (NPs) are hormones produced by the heart that regulate BP rhythm
by causing dilatation of vessels, sodium excretion, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS). We have demonstrated that there exists a diurnal rhythm (24-hour rhythm) of NPs, which
tracks closely with the BP rhythm and is in an antiphase relationship with the rhythm of the RAAS
hormones. Obese individuals have lower NP levels throughout the day and a misaligned NP-RAAS-BP
rhythm. LCZ696 is an FDA approved inhibitor of neprilysin (an NP degrading enzyme) that augments the
NP levels and also suppresses the RAAS. Hence, the confluence of putative NP deficiency and the NP-
RAAS-BP rhythm misalignment in obese may contribute to the high-risk nocturnal non-dipping BP profile
seen commonly among obese individuals. Chronophamacology (controlling the time of medication
administration) to synchronize the NP-RAAS-BP axis inherent biological rhythms may help control the
nocturnal BP dipping pattern in obese individuals. We hypothesize that nighttime administration of NP-
RAAS-BP axis therapy in obese hypertensive individuals will resynchronize their physiological rhythm
patterns and help to improve their nocturnal BP profile. We plan to conduct a patient-oriented
physiological, clinical trial to assess the effect of timing of administration of NP-RAAS-BP axis therapy (to
target the rhythm misalignment) and the type of NP-RAAS-BP axis therapy (to target NP deficiency) on
restoring the nocturnal BP dipping in obese hypertensives with non-dipping. We will conduct a 2x2 factorial
design trial, wherein individuals will be randomized to one of the four arms; 1) daytime dosing of LCZ696;
2) nighttime dosing of LCZ696; 3) daytime dosing of valsartan; or 4) nighttime dosing of valsartan. We will
study the effect of timing of NP-RAAS-BP axis medication inhibiting therapy (factor 1: morning vs. evening
dose) on the nighttime BP profile in obese hypertensive patients with nondipping nocturnal BP. We will
also assess the effect of the type of NP-RAAS-BP axis therapy (factor 2: LCZ696 vs. valsartan) on the
nocturnal BP profile in obese hypertensives with nondipping nocturnal BP. We will examine the impact of
timing and type of NP-RAAS-BP axis therapy on the NP levels, RAAS levels, and their diurnal rhythms.
This study will assess an innovative physiologically-driven precision medicine approach of using
chronopharmacology for resynchronizing the NP-RAAS-BP rhythm axis and restoring the normal BP
rhythm in obese hypertensives with non-dipping BP."

Post-acute care (PAC) is increasingly common and costly. One in five Medicare beneficiaries receives care
after hospitalization in a skilled nursing facility at a cost of more than $28 billion annually. Unfortunately, more
than 1 in 4 Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, and these readmissions are
associated with increased mortality. The Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing program (SNF VBP)
ties Medicare reimbursements to SNF to their 30-day all-cause hospital readmission rates. Determining the
effect of SNF VBP on patient outcomes is crucial for patients, health systems, and policymakers, and will
inform the development and implementation of similar programs in other post-acute care settings. Evaluating
potential unintended consequences of this policy is especially important because SNFs face significant
financial pressure, and SNFs that care for large proportions of patients who are especially vulnerable to
adverse outcomes (e.g. frail, cognitively impaired, poor, or racial and ethnic minority populations) are most
likely to be penalized under the program, potentially leading to increased disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic
may have magnified the effects of SNF VBP, acting as a second “stress” on SNFs already stressed by SNF
VBP. There is an urgent need to determine the effect of SNF VBP on patient outcomes and on disparities,
especially given the magnifying effect of COVID-19. Our long-term goal is to drive the delivery of high-value
care for all older adults leaving the hospital. SNF VBP is among the first pay-for-performance programs in post-
acute care settings. In order to improve the development and success of these policies, it is crucial to
understand how their design and implementation influences outcomes. Our central hypothesis, based on
preliminary data, is that SNF VBP achieves its intended effects at SNFs that were already high-performing, but
has unintended and negative effects at low-performing SNFs. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine the
impact of SNF VBP on intended outcomes prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) Determine the effect of SNF
VBP on disparities in outcomes in vulnerable populations; 3) Determine how financial penalties from SNF VBP
impacted COVID-19 readiness and outcomes; and 4) Assess key aspects of organizational context among
SNFs that improved performance in SNF VBP and explore how this impacted their response to COVID-19.
Accomplishing these aims will improve the design of future VBP initiatives, and lead to higher-value care for
the growing number of vulnerable older adults receiving SNF care."
10760290,"APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). The role of human APOE
variants in AD has been studied extensively in the regulation of microglia and astrocytes but not in neutrophils.
APOE is also expressed in neutrophils and controls their activation. Moreover, neutrophils have been shown to
play a negative role in AD mice via the induction of microgliosis. Thus, a key question is whether APOE variants
derived from neutrophils control immune responses driven by microglia and contribute to disease progression.
Our long-term goal is to define the role of APOE signaling in regulation neutrophil-microglia interactions in
neurodegeneration and determine which phenotypes and functions play a role in AD. We made the
following preliminary observations: 1) Induction of APOE expression in microglia in AD and tau mice is
associated with a phenotype switch from homeostatic (M0) to neurodegenerative microglia (MGnD); 2) APOE4
drives a neurodegenerative signature in neutrophils; 3) Recruited APOE4-neutrophils promote MGnD-microglia
in APP/PS1 and P301S mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that APOE4 inflammatory
neutrophils promote MGnD-microglia and accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. We
will address our hypothesis in the following aims:
Aim 1: Define how APOE variants in neutrophils affects microglia. We propose to 1) Define the role of
APOE variants in neutrophils in the regulation of neutrophil-microglia crosstalk; and 2) Determine whether
replacement of APOE4 neutrophils with APOE2/3 neutrophils will restore microglial neuroprotective functions.
Aim 2: Define the impact of APOE variants in microglia on neutrophil recruitment to the diseased brain.
We will 1) Determine whether APOE variants modulate microglia to induce recruitment of neutrophils to the brain;
and 2) Investigate the spatial distribution of microglia and neutrophils in the brain of AD and tau mouse models.
Aim 3: Define the role of APOE variants in human neutrophils and their impact on human microglia in
AD. We propose to 1) Characterize human neutrophils isolated from APOE e2, e3 and e4 AD carriers and whether
they directly regulate the MGnD signature in iPSC-microglia; and 2) Investigate the neutrophil-microglia spatial
interactions in AD brain of human APOE e2, e3 and e4 AD carriers.
IN SUMMARY, targeting the APOE-neutrophil-microglia axis may provide a novel approach for therapeutic
modulation of innate immunity in AD and dementia."

Southern University (TSU) are jointly submitting a P20 application to build a collaborative partnership in cancer
research, education, and outreach. DLDCCC is a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center. TSU
is one of the nation’s largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) serving underserved
populations and underrepresented students (ISUPSs). BCM and TSU have had several successful
collaborations. This relationship was strengthened recently through TSU’s U54 “Center for Biomedical and
Minority Health Research”, where BCM faculty have partnered closely on collaborative cancer disparities
community education and outreach. This P20 program provides an excellent opportunity for TSU and BCM to
expand collaborations. We propose a BCM-TSU P20 program “Collaborative Union for Cancer Research,
Education and Disparities” (CURED) that will foster strong collaborations utilizing our complementary strengths.
Overall objectives are to create a shared infrastructure that will provide an optimal environment for cancer
research, education, community outreach, and career development and diversify the biomedical workforce.
CURED was established under the direction of senior leadership at each institution, reflected in the significant
institutional support for this partnership. BCM has committed $160,000/year for four years in cost matching funds,
$ 50,000 for Pilot project 2 for one year, and committed funds to support the training of TSU summer students
in the Cancer Research Education Program. TSU has committed to return the Indirect Cost allocation amounting
to $98,000 each year. All TSU investigators are members of the DLDCCC. Leaders of each institution are thus
committed to empower the P20 partnership to address cancer health disparities among URM and underserved
populations in Houston. Our goals are to (1) establish a collaborative alliance between BCM and TSU for cancer
research, education, and community outreach. We will (a) establish CURED offices in both institutions that will
provide coordination for relevant activities, evaluate progress of current projects, and ensure a pipeline of
innovative pilot projects; (b) centralize institutional resources for faculty/trainee research needs (c) lead a cancer
research and career development program for TSU students that includes mentored cancer research, an
educational curriculum, hands-on training in emerging technologies, and professional development; (d) build a
BCM/TSU comprehensive outreach program to address cancer disparities at the bench, bedside, and within the
community; and (2) to support a pipeline of collaborative innovative cancer research pilot projects.
Overall Impact: We are certain that the proposed CURED will enhance cancer research education capacity at
TSU, promote a diverse research workforce, and improve BCM/DLDCCC’s effectiveness in developing and
sustaining research programs focused on cancer health disparities. We will develop sustainable research
capacity leading to independent and collaborative applications to the NIH/other Federal/Non-federal agencies."

C-reactive protein (CRP) was discovered in the blood obtained from patients infected with Streptococcus
pneumoniae and was found to be a component of innate immunity and inflammatory response. In murine
models of infection, human CRP is protective against lethal infection with S. pneumoniae. The mechanisms of
anti-pneumococcal action of CRP are not defined yet. Interestingly, CRP was protective only during the early
stages of infection, i.e., when CRP was injected into mice within 6 h of administering pneumococci. CRP was
not protective during the late stages of infection, i.e., CRP was not protective when injected into mice after 6 h
of administering pneumococci. In vitro, CRP binds to phosphocholine groups present in the cell wall C-
polysaccharide of pneumococci and subsequently activates the complement system. Accordingly, it is
hypothesized that CRP is protective because ligand-bound CRP activates the complement system on the
pneumococcal surface leading to the reduction of bacteremia. This hypothesis explains the protective effects of
CRP during the early stages of infection, but this does not explain why CRP loses its protective effect during
the late stages of infection. We hypothesize that CRP works through two mechanisms: one mechanism based
on the binding of CRP to phosphocholine and subsequent complement activation and one mechanism based
on the binding of CRP to complement inhibitor factor H. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three
specific aims. In aim 1, the hypothesis that “the activation of the complement system on the pneumococcal
surface, subsequent to the binding of CRP to pneumococci, participate in CRP-mediated protection” will be
tested. In aim 2, two hypotheses that “pneumococci recruit complement inhibitory protein factor H on their
surface and evade complement attack during late stage infection” and that “structurally altered CRP capable of
binding to factor H can protect mice against infection during the late stages also” will be tested. In aim 3, the
hypothesis that “the binding of CRP to phosphocholine groups is critical for complement activation and killing of
pneumococci” will be tested. These hypotheses will be tested by using mutants of CRP incapable of activating
murine complement, capable of binding to factor H, and incapable of binding to phosphocholine and by
employing both wild-type and CRP knockout mice. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into
the mechanisms of anti-pneumococcal functions of CRP which may lead to the development of a CRP-based
strategy to treat late stage pneumococcal infection."
10744207,"The global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is aimed to achieve 90% HIV suppression worldwide.
However, even with increased access to ART, many countries are not on track to achieving this goal.
Among the factors that impede retention in HIV care, ART adherence and HIV suppression is the social
stigmatization of HIV infection. HIV stigmas and behaviors intended to avoid stigma have the adverse
consequences of deterring people from seeking care, interfering with clinic attendance, and detracting
from taking ART. Interventions to increase HIV care retention and ART adherence have not thus far focused
on reducing the adverse effects of stigma in countries where HIV is most prevalent. This application proposes
to test a theory-based mobile-phone delivered counseling intervention designed to address HIV-stigma
concerns in order to improve HIV treatment retention and adherence in South Africa. The intervention is
grounded in Behavioral Self-Regulation Theory and the HIV Stigma Framework and was developed in
partnership with South African public health agencies. The intervention approach uses health decision-
making and problem-solving skills aimed at resolving social and structural barriers to care, and is delivered
by community health worker/lay counselors to increase its potential for scale-up. To test the efficacy of this
newly developed and fully pilot tested intervention model, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial designed
to tease-out the additive effects of directly addressing stigma concerns by augmenting a Behavioral Self-
Regulation Counseling with stigma management components. We will conduct a 3-arm clinical trial in a
resource limited township in South Africa that has shown evidence of high-HIV stigma to compare: (a)
Behavioral Self-Regulation + Stigma Management Counseling for HIV treatment retention and adherence,
vs. (b) Behavioral Self-Regulation Counseling for HIV treatment retention and adherence, vs. (c) Uniform
standard of care HIV patient education. The trial will enroll 1200 men and women with unsuppressed HIV
and receiving HIV treatment in South Africa’s HIV care system. Participants will be followed for 15-months
post-intervention to assess intervention effects on HIV care retention and HIV suppression (primary
outcomes) and ART adherence (secondary outcome). Conditional process modeling will determine
underlying mechanisms (e.g., self-efficacy, behavioral strategies, internalized stigma, anticipated stigma)
that account for intervention effects and how these mechanisms may vary by level of baseline experiences
with enacted HIV stigma. The trial will also perform implementation research activities to inform potential
scale-up should the intervention be shown efficacious. This newly developed intervention model is
designed for use with existing clinical resources in WHO defined systems of differentiated HIV care."
10874764,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malaria continues to be a major burden on global health, infecting over 220 million and killing over 400
thousand people annually. Although the past fifteen years of enhanced international efforts to eradicate
malaria has reduced malaria incidence worldwide, this progress has stagnated in recent years.
Antimalarial drugs are foundational in reducing disease and transmission, but resistance has developed
within twelve years of clinical introduction to every antimalarial drug developed since 1945 including
the current front-line artemisinin-based combination therapies. This ease with which parasites develop
resistance clearly indicates that innovative approaches to antimalarial drug discovery are urgently
needed. Here we propose two separate strategies designed to discover antimalarial drug targets for
which resistance will be difficult to develop in the field. The first approach will characterize metabolic
adaptations acquired by malaria parasites upon becoming resistant to a primary drug, with a focus on
identifying novel metabolic dependencies (vulnerabilities) of resistant parasites. We propose to employ
our extensive experience in metabolomic characterization of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium
falciparum, to compare drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasite biochemical architectures.
Metabolomics will be used to elucidate altered metabolic pathways in resistant parasites in order to
reveal collateral sensitivities that we will validate as putative drug targets using either small molecule
pathway inhibitors or genetic knockdowns of relevant target enzymes. The ultimate goal will be to target
these collateral sensitivities together with the primary drug to lock the parasite into a drug-sensitive
state, as the adaptations required for primary resistance are no longer available, thus providing an
enduring, complementary combination therapy. For the second strategy, we propose to discover host
metabolic processes that are critical to support blood-stage development of P. falciparum. The blood
stages of the malaria parasite life cycle are responsible for both the symptomology and the human-to-
mosquito transmission of the parasite, and critically rely on nutrients from human serum. However, we
have found that different human serum lots are highly variable in their ability to support parasite growth
and transmission. To identify serum metabolites that correlate with parasite phenotypic readouts, we
propose to utilize our metabolomic approaches in combination with standard parasite growth and
transmission assays. Using serum lots from healthy donors, this approach will identify naturally
variable, and thus potentially targetable, host processes upon which the parasite is reliant. Targeting
host factors takes the evolutionary control away from the parasite, reducing the probability of resistance
emergence. In all, this proposal seeks to address the persistent problem of antimalarial drug resistance
development by evaluating two new strategies for discovering resistance-resistant drug targets."

Touch is essential for our survival and for social bonding, and in disrupted in many forms of injuries and
disease states. Despite its fundamental importance, touch transduction remains one of the least understood
signaling processes, both at the cellular and molecular levels. Touch is mediated by receptors imbedded in the
skin, most of which are composed of nerve endings and accessory glial or epithelial cells. Groundbreaking
work on the mammalian Merkel cells complex demonstrated that the epithelial cell, rather than the neuron, is
the primary sensory cell. However, little is known about the contribution of glia to the function of other touch
receptors, including the Pacinian and Meissner’s corpuscles. If glia of touch receptors are found to sense and
mediate the transduction of mechanical forces, this finding would constitute a paradigm shift and may suggest
these cells as novel targets for the treatment of conditions in which touch is disrupted. My lab has dedicated
the last 16 years to the study of glia/neuron cross talk using the pioneering model organism C. elegans. We
found that Amphid glial cells (Amsh) of the worm nose touch receptor complex respond to touch by rise of
intracellular Ca2+ and Cl-. These results suggest that Amsh glia may be endowed with mechanisms that detect
mechanical forces. Furthermore, we found that Ca2+ responses in Amsh glia temporally precede neuronal Ca2+
responses, raising the intriguing possibility that glia might be the primary sensory cells. The goal of this
proposal is to leverage C. elegans genetics, in vivo Ca2+ and Cl- imaging tools, and straightforward behavioral
assays to dissect from gene to behavior glial mechanosensitivity and glia/neuron cross talk in the worm nose
touch receptor. Our inter-related but independent aims are: 1) To determine what mediates Ca2+ transients in
Amsh glia upon touch stimulation and their function in touch, 2) To identify mechanisms of glia/neuron
crosstalk in touch receptors, and 3) To determine what mediates Amsh glial Cl- changes upon touch
stimulation and their function in touch. Pioneering work in mammals has advanced our understanding of touch
sensation. However, progress has been hindered by the difficulty of harvesting touch receptors from the skin
and the complexity of the mammalian system. I have now the unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on this
previous work to explore a new area in the field using the genetically amenable and more tractable model C.
elegans. My work is likely to reveal general principles of glial function and glia/neuron crosstalk relevant to
other sensory systems and other parts of the nervous system."
10936514,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor affecting adults, with a median survival
time of 12-15 months. The standard of care for treating GBMs is maximum tumor resection followed by
concomitant radiation and temozolomide therapy. However, tumor cells remain in the brain after resection,
posing the threat of disease recurrence. Systemically administered treatments like radiation and chemotherapies
are not targeted to the microscopic tumor lesions present in the brain post-surgery and are thus ineffective at
preventing recurrence for 90% of GBM patients. Our group and others have demonstrated the promise of
therapeutic neural stem cells (tNSCs) as a drug delivery platform for treating post-operative GBM due to an
innate property known as tumor tropism. tNSCs interact with cytokines secreted by GBM cells, initiating a
signaling cascade which results in tNSC migration in the direction of the tumor. This directional migration can be
leveraged as a targeting mechanism for the delivery of drugs secreted by genetically engineered tNSCs.
However, the platform's durability is limited by rapid clearance of tNSCs implanted directly into the GBM resection
cavity. Encapsulation of tNSCs in biomaterials when delivered into the cavity could prevent this rapid clearance
and lengthen the duration of therapeutic efficacy. Our group has demonstrated that biocompatible materials such
as commercially available hemostats are able to support long-term in vivo tNSC viability. However, these
matrices can pose a barrier to tNSC migration, resulting in insignificant tumor killing compared to tNSCs injected
in PBS alone. Thus, we discovered that a balance between enhanced tNSC viability and unimpaired cell
migration must be reached to optimize tNSCs for long-term GBM therapy. To do so, we will develop a novel
adaptation of the 3D printing technology, continuous liquid interface production (CLIP), in which tNSCs are 3D
printed into hydrogels in a process known as bioprinting. This results in cell-embedded 3D hydrogels which could
be implanted into the GBM resection cavity without any intermediate cell seeding steps. We have shown that
bioprinted cell-laden hydrogels exhibit higher seeding consistency than cells seeded externally onto hydrogel
surfaces. However, cell behavior and function has not been characterized or optimized inside bioprinted
hydrogels. Moreover, the most biocompatible hydrogels which support the longest cell viability exhibit the lowest
printing resolution. Thus, we propose to optimize this novel bioprinting strategy by developing a biocompatible
and printable resin that can support cell viability for at least one month. Furthermore, we will characterize cell
health and functionality pre- and post-bioprinting to ensure that toxic resin monomers and UV light have not
compromised the efficacy or safety of the embedded cells. Finally, we will characterize the efficacy of cell-laden
bioprinted hydrogels in a post-resection GBM mouse model with unencapsulated cells serving as a comparator.
We hypothesize that the optimized bioprinting strategy will result in higher consistency during manufacturing,
easier clinical handling, and a longer duration of tumor suppression, leading to improved patient outcomes."

 Structural variants (SVs) are the largest source of variations in the human genome and are frequently
associated with disease phenotypes. Thus, the identification and characterization of SVs are essential for
understanding human genome structure and function. The goal of this proposal is to develop a generalized SV
calling pipeline that can leverage information from the latest developments in sequencing technology and
human reference genome representations to discover and resolve SVs at high accuracy. I will first integrate
information across sequencing platforms to increase SV calling accuracy. Multiple sequencing and mapping
platforms are now used to detect SVs from human genome data. My pipeline will increase the accuracy of SV
calling with a data integration model that handles a diverse set of genomic platforms. I will next develop a novel
SV scoring model based on genomic context and coverage. Several factors, such as the generally low
sequence coverage in typical long-read studies, as well as alignment errors due to highly repetitive sequences,
can result in a potentially high rates of false positives for SVs when using parameters for high-sensitivity
calling. I use two sets of important features of SVs, genomic context and coverage, into a machine-learning
model to compute confidence in SV calls for downstream analysis. Finally, I will add support for graph genome
alignments by implementing support for sequence data aligned to graph genome assemblies in GFA file
format. Unlike single reference genomes, pangenomes are particularly useful for characterizing large-scale
structural differences in genomes between different ethnicity groups. Pangenomes would bring us closer to
capturing the full extent of human genomic variation, and thus represent an important resource to leverage for
SV calling. In summary, in this project I will develop a generalized SV calling pipeline capable of integrating
multiple technical platforms for discovering SVs and providing support for future developments in pangenome
graph assemblies. With the research training plan, I will 1) gain expertise in genomics and bioinformatics, 2)
promote diversity in biomedical research though involvement in educational efforts in the community, 3)
develop oral and written communication skills, and 4) prepare a scientific career focused on the study and
education of human genome variation."
10918084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer is set to bypass cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death in United States and it is a
leading cause of death worldwide. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a major contributing factor to this
statistic. Recent advancements in chemotherapeutic delivery and the development small molecule inhibitors,
such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been indispensable in decreasing disease prevalence and burden.
Additionally, the recent FDA approvals of immunomodulating therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and bispecific antibodies, emphasizes the importance that
immune system evasion plays in disease progression and relapse. Unfortunately, administration of these
targeted and immunomodulating therapies is often met with tumor acquired resistance (e.g., secondary
mutations; T cell exhaustion) and incites non-specific or on-target/off tumor side effects (e.g., immune related
adverse events). This suggests a need for alternative or adjuvant NSCLC therapies that are not only potent and
efficacious but exercise a wide therapeutic index. We propose to exploit aptamer technology as one potential
way to address this need. Aptamers are single strand oligonucleotides that bind to their targets with high
specificity and affinity and their relative lack of immunogenicity as a foreign substance, compared to antibodies,
make them ideal reagents to modulate the immune system. Furthermore, their ease of manipulation makes
molecular engineering to design and optimize such reagents relatively straightforward. Our goal is to develop
novel immunomodulating bispecific aptamers (bsApts) that dually bind to immune cell CD3ε and NSCLC tumor
associated antigens (TAAs) to induce formation of effective immune synapses. We propose to use molecular
engineering techniques to rationally design bsApts and systematically evaluate specific bsApt properties, such
as (i) valency, (ii) affinity, and (iii) linker length/type in their ability to induce artificial immune cell activation in
vitro and anti-tumor responses in vivo. We also propose to take a transcriptomics approach to better understand
how designs/targets affect tumor heterogeneity, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte phenotypes, and off-target immune
cell activation. Secondary goals look at improving pharmacokinetic properties that limit bsApt clinical
translatability while long-term goals look to generalize our findings on these properties to current and future
bispecific therapies that target a wide range of solid and hematological cancers."

Hazardous alcohol use and binge drinking, the deadliest form of excessive alcohol use1-3, are substantially
more prevalent among sexual and gender minority adults compared to their cisgender straight counterparts4-11.
Minority stress from structural stigma drives sexual and gender minority health disparities12-16, but its potential
effect on binge drinking and hazardous alcohol use has yet to be rigorously examined.
Structural stigma is potentially amenable to intervention by equality-promoting policies at the state level that
explicitly name sexual and gender minority people as protected classes in employment, housing, public
accommodations, and other essential services17. The extent to which changes in state equality-promoting
policies relate to changes in binge drinking and hazardous alcohol use for sexual and gender minority adults
compared to their cisgender straight counterparts is unknown and the focus of the proposed study.
This study aims to evaluate differential effects of state equality-promoting policies (Aim 1) and key policy
domains (Aim 2) on binge drinking and hazardous alcohol use among sexual and gender minority adults. Non-
randomized variation in state equality-promoting policies necessitates the application of advanced
econometrics methods. To rigorously estimate effects and make causal inferences, triple differences models
and identifiability assumptions will be specified to analyze nationally representative data18 on over 72,000
sexual and gender minority adults linked with indices of state equality-promoting policies19 from 2014-2022.
The landscape of equality-promoting policies for sexual and gender minority people is ever evolving. This study
will offer a timely evidence base to inform needed structural interventions that reduce alcohol-related morbidity
and mortality among sexual and gender minority populations. With support from a premier mentorship team,
the applicant will build skills in (1) advanced econometrics methods for causal inference, (2) alcohol research
and social determinants of harmful alcohol use, and (3) identification of relevant and actionable social policies
that influence sexual and gender minority health. Achievement of these training goals will launch the
applicant’s career as a successful, independent researcher."

Chloride is the most abundant inorganic anion in the human body. It is required for essential physiological
functions ranging from electrolyte balance, acidosis, innate immunity, circadian rhythms, and even taste
sensation. However, disruptions in chloride homeostasis, arising from diet or genetics, are linked to diseases
including cystic fibrosis, hearing loss, kidney stones, myotonia, and osteopetrosis, as well as cancers, cardiac
dysfunction, and neurological disorders. To dissect the contributions of chloride in healthy and disease states, a
fundamental understanding of its distribution, regulation, and biomolecular targets at the cellular level is needed.
As a step towards this long-term goal, the proposed research program will engineer and apply new fluorescent
protein-based imaging technologies to monitor and measure chloride in living systems across time and space
dimensions. Over three independent project directions, innovative strategies will be used to address practical
gaps in biosensor design, while at the same time rigorous and reproducible biological applications will be
established in user-friendly cell lines to democratize chloride imaging. Ultimately, the resulting technologies will
illuminate chloride in fundamental biological processes that are dysregulated in disease, leading the way to
therapeutically target this vital anion for improving human health."

The research in this proposal focuses on plant immune perception of bacterial pathogens. Plants possess a
sophisticated innate immune system comprised of germline encoded immune receptors capable of recognizing
all pathogen classes. These immune receptors are structurally similar to their animal counterparts and include
surface localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as well as intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine rich
repeat (NLR) receptors. Plant immune receptors and downstream signaling nodes are controlled by post-
translational modifications, allowing rapid regulation of the initiation, amplitude, and duration of defense.
Although PRRs and NLRs are structurally distinct and exhibit differences in defense timing and amplitude, they
share significant overlap in posttranslational modification of critical downstream signaling nodes. However, our
data demonstrates that the kinases involved in mediating PRR and NLR responses at key signaling nodes are
distinct. Here, we will investigate mechanisms regulating innate immune signal intensity, signal propagation
and cell specific responses within a leaf. We will analyze the importance of specific protein kinases for
mediating the intensity of NLR-triggered immune responses. We will investigate the role of tandemly arrayed
cysteine rich-receptor like kinases as secondary immune receptors that propagate signals of pathogen
perception. Finally, we will investigate cell specific innate immune responses. This project will train the next
generation of scientists and result in discoveries that lead to a better understanding of how signals of initial
pathogen perception are integrated into an effective defense response within a plant organ."

fundamental drivers of human disease, and our ability to meet contemporary clinical challenges, including
neurodegenerative and metabolic disease, chronic pain and optimizing healthy aging, requires a broader understanding of
mechanisms of intercellular and intracellular communication. The proposed UNE Center for Cell Signaling Research
(CCSR) will build a critical mass of talented investigators with a broad research emphasis on cellular metabolism,
inflammation and aging. The initial Research Project Leaders (RPLs), selected through a competitive process, bring
diverse and complementary expertise from across UNE colleges and departments. Their research projects address discrete
clinical challenges by investigating fundamental cell biological mechanisms that may have broad ramifications for human
disease. New faculty recruitment and support of a pilot project program will ensure a continued pipeline of RPLs and
further grow the Center. Investigators will be provided with a structured mentorship program to support both their
professional and research program development in their progression to independent funding and beyond. The proposed
Center will also expand the research infrastructure at UNE to support the innovative research programs of investigators
in cell signaling. The proposed In Vitro Analytical Core will support the research of the RPLs with outstanding
instrumentation and innovative services that are not broadly available elsewhere in the region, including primary cell and
cell line culturing, transfection and analysis through functional imaging as well as transcriptional and protein-based
analysis. The core will be housed in newly renovated research space that will be contiguous with an existing UNE
Histology and Imaging Core, providing a unique suite of resources to support research at UNE. Institutional commitments
include additional protected research time for RPLs and institutional matching funds for the pilot project program. In
addition, the university has committed to hiring 3 additional investigators whose research programs will complement
those of the existing faculty. The Center will also benefit from strong continued institutional investment into research
infrastructure, as well as well-established collaborations with neighboring IDeA state programs in Maine and New
Hampshire. Research infrastructure will be enhanced by laboratory renovations, purchasing new instrumentation, and key
support for personnel. Additional institutional support has been committed for each of these. With sound financial and
administrative management and regular assessments of performance with specified bench marks, the CCSR will be well-
positioned to make a significant impact in optimizing healthy, pain-free aging and in finding new treatments for

Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the United States and is
associated with substantial adverse effects on quality of life as well as a mortality rate on the
order of the most lethal forms of cancer. Treatment for adults with HF varies from well-
established neurohormonal inhibitors to device therapy. However, despite the demonstrated
benefits of current therapy, the societal and economic burdens of HF are increasing. In pediatric
HF from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) five-year freedom from death or transplant remains low,
ranging from 54%-63%. This suggests that there are underlying myocardial cellular
mechanisms uniquely regulated in children with HF. Irrespective of age or etiology of HF, new
therapies for HF are necessary to improve morbidity and mortality and decrease health care
costs.
The proposed studies will use meticulously preserved pediatric serum along with all relevant
clinical data, and are designed to integrate patient samples with an in vitro system that is a
surrogate for pathological changes observed in the myocardium. In addition, this award will
provide protected time for Dr. Sucharov to continue her successful mentorship of junior faculty
and fellows trainees. The translational aspect of this work will be relevant to MD fellows and
junior faculty, and will allow patient oriented research without risk to children with HF."

Neurons have classically been defined by the neurotransmitter they release. This “identity” has
been considered to be both singular (i.e. one transmitter) and immutable (i.e. genetically
hardwired). While the astonishing prevalence of cotransmission has changed thinking about the
singularity of neurotransmitter identity there has been considerably less appreciation of the
ability of neurons to exhibit plasticity in their expression. Recently, we discovered that the
microRNA miR-190 is a potent regulator of adult sleep. Spatial and temporal mapping of its site
of action demonstrates that it is required during pupation in a population of cells that transcribes
both cholinergic and glutamatergic genes but differentiates to become a small subset of the
adult glutamatergic neurons. This subset includes components of the core sleep homeostasis
circuit. We will test the hypothesis that a neurotransmitter plasticity event is critical to function of
the mature circuit and that it provides a novel mechanism for establishing, and potentially
modifying, the sleep set-point of the homeostatic machinery.
Aim 1 will determine the role of neurotransmitter plasticity in the control of adult sleep, with a
focus on understanding the circuit-level changes.
Aim 2 will investigate the role of neuronal activity in transmitter switching and homeostat
plasticity, with a focus on understanding the molecular events.
In this proposal, we bring the power of Drosophila genetics to bear on this novel and important
type of plasticity. We demonstrate that programmed transmitter plasticity during pupal life is
crucial to adult function of the sleep circuitry. The genetic reagents we have developed will allow
us to address basic mechanisms underlying transmitter plasticity in the context of both the
developing and mature nervous systems and, for the first time, link this type of plasticity to
sleep."
10747344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. It accounts for ~15% of
all breast cancer patients yet is responsible for 30% of breast cancer deaths. TNBC is treated primarily by
conventional chemotherapy; however, resistance to therapy is common leading to high mortality rates.
Recently, we identified hypoxia-induced ECM re-modeler, lysyl oxidase (LOX) as a key mediator of
doxorubicin resistance in TNBC (Saatci et al, Nature Communications, 2020). LOX inhibition offers a unique
opportunity to re-sensitize the most aggressive breast tumors to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics. The
overall objectives of this project are to (i) delineate the roles of LOX in chemoresistance, (ii) determine the
mechanisms through which LOX exerts these roles, (iii) and generate prototypes of potent and selective LOX
inhibitors to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC. We hypothesize that (i) LOX induces resistance not only
to doxorubicin but also to other chemotherapeutic drugs by its enzymatic activity; (ii) LOX exerts this effect
both by increasing collagen cross-linking/fibronectin assembly (canonical LOX function) leading to reduced
drug penetration and increased integrin-mediated signaling and by regulating transcription (non-canonical
LOX function) via interacting and oxidizing its substrates, culminating in activation of FAK/Src signaling and
cell survival; and (iii) targeting LOX activity with selective small-molecule inhibitors will overcome
chemoresistance by blocking both canonical and non-canonical LOX functions in TNBC. These hypotheses
will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To determine the role of canonical ECM cross-linking function
of LOX in resistance to different chemotherapeutics in TNBC. We will test the general chemosensitizer role
of LOX and necessity of its enzymatic activity by generating cells with CRISPR-mediated LOX knock-out and
reconstitution and testing their effects on chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. LOX-mediated ECM changes
will be analyzed by advanced microscopy techniques, e.g. MP-SHG, and the resulting drug penetration will
be studied by IF and MALDI-MSI. 2) To determine the role of non-canonical transcription-regulating functions
of LOX in TNBC chemoresistance. We will determine if LOX controls global transcription and identify novel
LOX substrates by combining transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) and proteomics (TurboID) approaches. We will
generate oxidation-deficient LOX substrates and test their effects on LOX-mediated chemoresistance. 3) To
characterize novel LOX enzymatic inhibitors and test their potential as chemosensitizers in TNBC. We will
test the selectivity of our inhibitors in cells with LOX knock-out/reconstitution and their off-target profiles and
test their chemosensitization ability in organoids. We will perform PK/PD and toxicity profiling studies and
test the inhibitors for overcoming chemoresistance in TNBC PDXs. The proposed project is expected to
provide key mechanistic and phenotypic pre-clinical data to show that targeting LOX will overcome
chemoresistance in the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, with a potential to reduce mortality rates."

Jennifer Dantzer, MD MHS is an allergy and immunology physician-scientist at Johns Hopkins University, with
a Master's Degree in Epidemiology. This K23 award will provide her valuable training towards her long-term
career goal of being an independent investigator focused on patient centered outcomes (PCO) of food allergy
treatments. Food allergy is a major public health disorder that affects at least 5.9 million American children and
is increasing in prevalence. Historically, food allergy management has been based on strict allergen avoidance
and recognition and treatment of allergic reactions. However, the burden of food avoidance and on-going
uncertainty over possible accidental exposures can have a significant psychosocial impact on children and
parents. The FDA approved the first treatment for peanut allergy, Palforzia, peanut oral immunotherapy
(POIT), in January 2020, ushering in a new era for food allergy treatment. While this paradigm shift in food
allergy management is monumental, there is significant uncertainty related to benefits/risks to the patient,
treatment preferences, and patient-centered outcomes (PCO). This gap in our understanding lead to this
project's overall objective to evaluate the patient perceived benefit of peanut allergy therapy and to better
understand decision-making with regard to discontinuation and treatment preferences. Aim 1 will examine
longitudinal change in child, adolescent, and caregiver food allergy related quality of life in a diverse, real-world
population on and off POIT. In addition, the long-term benefit of POIT is dependent upon on-going treatment
since stopping treatment causes the majority of patients to lose most or all protection. Aim 2 will use local and
national data as well as interviews and questionnaires to determine the rates, potential predictors, and reasons
for POIT discontinuation. Finally, Aim 3 will use a mixed methods approach to understand patient and parent
preferences for PA treatment. This K23 award addresses the mission of NIAID to better understand and treat
allergic diseases by using a novel approach and methods directed towards PCO research. The research will
be completed within the highly supportive training environment at Johns Hopkins, with the guidance of a team
of expert mentors with relevant expertise (Drs. Robert Wood, MD, Corinne Keet, MD PhD, Albert Wu, MD
MPH, Cynthia Rand, PhD and John F.P. Bridges, PhD). The career development plan combines hands-on
training, formal didactics, and outstanding mentorship in key areas of statistical analysis, epidemiology, and
advanced techniques in PCO research. This plan will ensure a successful transition to independence. This
K23 award will provide preliminary data and skills that are highly relevant and applicable to future R01 or U
level grants. Findings have the potential to change clinical practice not only related to POIT, but also for future
food allergy treatments, through enhanced benefit-risk assessment, best practice guidelines, and patient
decision-making tools."

Project Summary
Epigenetic mechanisms enable organisms to adapt to developmental and environmental cues. Plants have
evolved intricate regulatory networks to control development in response environmental stimuli such as
temperature and light. For example, prolonged cold triggers vernalization, a process that accelerates
flowering through epigenetic changes in genes involved in development. Therefore, the vernalization
response in Arabidopsis is an excellent model system for study of complex epigenetic regulation of gene
expression triggered by environmental cues in eukaryotes. Vernalization-mediated epigenetic changes
include the formation of chromatin loops and alterations in chromatin modifications and in expression of long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Changes in the three-dimensional structure of the genome, such as formation of
local chromatin loops, are increasingly recognized as important gene regulatory events in eukaryotes;
however, how chromatin modifications and lncRNAs coordinate to influence gene expression through
changes in the three-dimensional structure of the genome is not well understood. Here we seek to
understand the mechanistic details of how the three-dimensional structure of the genome influences gene
regulation in vivo using developmental changes in flowering and photomorphogenesis as phenotypical read-
outs. Our overriding goal is to elucidate structural and regulatory components governing protein- and
lncRNA-mediated epigenetic gene regulation in Arabidopsis through three specific aims designed to: 1)
elucidate the detailed mechanisms of chromatin structure-mediated gene regulation focusing on two groups
of chromatin architectural proteins that we showed coordinate gene regulation through the formation of
chromatin loops, 2) characterize mechanisms underlying light signaling-mediated chromatin conformation
changes, and 3) characterize genome-wide changes in chromatin structure induced by environmental stimuli.
Our approach will reveal the mechanistic details of chromatin structure-based epigenetic regulation by both
protein and lncRNA components during flowering and photomorphogenesis. These findings will further our
understanding of the mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression, which has a deep evolutionary
root among eukaryotes."

Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to human health, with many types of infections having
far-reaching, global consequences. The ability to develop vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics to
prevent, treat, and identify infectious diseases is a critical public health need. Clinical trials are an integral
component of these development efforts. Since the 1960s the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units
(VTEUs) have conducted trials that have evaluated promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates for infectious
diseases such as influenza (including pandemic and avian influenza), malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal
infection, in children and adults. In addition, the VTEUs have quickly launched trials in response to newly
emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, and Waves 1 and
5 of the H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks in China. These efforts have provided data that informed public health
policy.
This proposal is in response to a new VTEU structure which will involve greater collaboration between the
VTEUs, NIAID, and the newly formed Leadership Group structure that are all part of the NIAID Infectious
Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). The IDCRC will enhance integration and efficiency of
operations and, importantly, will foster the collaborative team science approaches now recognized as optimal
to address important and complicated public health research priorities.
Under the new cooperative agreement, the Kaiser Washington VTEU will continue to conduct clinical research
and trials, including trials conducted under an IND or IDE, within the Kaiser Washington integrated care system
to contribute to the priority research foci of NIAID. These priority areas include malaria, influenza and other
respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections and include clinical trials, including human challenge models,
and pharmacokinetic studies. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Seattle area infectious
disease research partners who will provide scientific expertise, specialized facilities, and advanced
immunologic laboratory capabilities. The Kaiser Washington VTEU will also develop and maintain surge
capacity for clinical site, pharmacy and laboratory operations to enable the rapid initiation of clinical trials and
other studies in response to emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats of public health importance."
10747358,"The dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) into synthetic SMCs, a hallmark of many
occlusive vascular diseases, is associated with a metabolic switch that is characterized by increased aerobic
glycolysis, which also fuels mevalonate metabolism, decreased glucose oxidation and increased fatty acid
oxidation. However, the molecular links between environmental cues and the metabolic reprogramming remain
poorly understood. Our pilot studies revealed that cyclin dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is a master regulator of
the metabolic control of vascular SMC dedifferentiation for intimal hyperplasia toward vascular occlusion.
Mechanistic investigations uncovered that CDK8 controls the SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element binding
factor-2)-operated transcription to promote the mevalonate metabolism for protein geranylgeranylation, which
drives the vascular SMC dedifferentiation. Thus, we propose a novel paradigm in which CDK8 controls the
mevalonate metabolism for protein geranylgeranylation to promote the dedifferentiation of vascular SMCs for
intimal hyperplasia, thereby contributing to occlusive vascular disease. We will test this hypothesis and
delineate the molecular mechanisms of CDK8-operated metabolic control of vascular SMC dedifferentiation by
2 specific aims: Aim 1 will establish a mediator role of CDK8 in vascular SMC dedifferentiation into synthetic
SMCs for intimal hyperplasia toward vascular occlusion; Aim 2 will determine the underlying molecular
mechanisms with a focus on the molecular network by which CDK8 operates the mevalonate metabolism
pathway for protein geranylgeranylation which is required for vascular SMC dedifferentiation into synthetic
SMCs leading to intimal hyperplasia toward vascular occlusion. This proposal will provide the first assessment
of CDK8-mediated occlusive vascular lesion formation and define a novel pathway of occlusive vascular
remodeling that is mediated by previously unrecognized CDK8-operated metabolic reprogramming for vascular
SMC dedifferentiation, thus shedding light on the study of vascular SMC plasticity as well as the development
of innovative and effective therapeutic approaches for occlusive vascular disease."
10747359,"Establishing the mechanism of benefit and dose of exercise required to improve liver histology in
patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
PROJECT SUMMARY— In this career development program, I will study how exercise improves nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) and answer three highly significant questions about exercise’s (1) mechanism of benefit,
(2) dose, and (3) impact on liver histology. This program builds on my clinical experience in NASH through
mentored training in: (1) mechanistic study (Dr. Scot Kimball), (2) exercise (Drs. Kathryn Schmitz, Christopher
Sciamanna), and (3) NASH trials (Dr. Rohit Loomba). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that exercise
training will activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by depleting liver glycogen, leading to liver
fat reduction and intermediate histologic endpoint improvement in patients with NASH. Because
glycogen is the main substrate used during exercise to generate ATP, I hypothesize exercise will lead to glycogen
dissociation from AMPK and subsequent AMPK activation. The central hypothesis is based on a 16-wk proof of
concept study in 18 adult patients with NASH in which I found only those who completed a 750 Metabolic
Equivalents of Task (MET)-min/wk dose of exercise achieved the minimal clinically important difference in
magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) measured liver fat, that surrogates for
histologic response. I observed this in parallel with indirect changes in the AMPK pathway, suggesting AMPK
was activated by exercise. While I did not study exercise dose >750 MET-min/wk, it is plausible that higher doses
may be even more effective because glycogen depletion requires sustained moderate-vigorous intensity
exercise. Given these pilot data, I will conduct a 16-wk clinical trial and randomize adults with NASH to different
exercise doses (750 or 1,000 MET-min/wk) or standard clinical care. To ensure adherence, each exercise
session will be completed under direct supervision, either in-person or remotely with telehealth, followed by
immediate calculation of exercise dose as intensity (METs) x frequency (one session) x time (min). In Aim 1, I
will study the mechanism of exercise’s benefit with MR-spectroscopy measured change in liver glycogen and
ATP following a single session of sustained moderate-vigorous exercise. In Aim 2, I will discern which dose is
most effective in reducing MRI-PDFF after 16-wks of exercise training. In Aim 3, I will measure important
intermediate histologic endpoints (NASH activity score) and mechanisms (AMPK activation, AMPK targets). Co-
localization of glycogen binding to AMPK in liver tissue will be used to confirm indirect MR-spectroscopy evidence
from Aim 1. When I am successful, I will have provided rigorous evidence to decipher the dose required and the
underlying mechanisms explaining how exercise training leads to improvement in intermediate histologic
endpoints, including NASH activity. This research will inform future trial design by generating data for sample
size estimates necessary to study exercise’s impact on long-term histologic outcomes, including liver fibrosis. I
am committed to a career as a physician scientist and have constructed my training plan to achieve scientific
independence and make substantial contributions to advancing the study of NASH and public health."
10775693,"Project Summary
Magnetic hyperthermia is a highly promising therapeutic modality for treatment of various cancers. It is based
on the concept that magnetic nanoparticles delivered to cancer tumors can generate heat after exposure to a
non-invasive external alternating magnetic field (AMF). Many preclinical and clinical studies have validated the
significant potential of nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia to either kill cancer cells directly or enhance their
susceptibility to radiation and chemotherapy. Despite its promising potential, magnetic hyperthermia is currently
limited to treatment of localized and relatively accessible tumors, because the required therapeutic temperatures
above 42 0C can only be achieved by direct intratumoral injection of conventional iron oxide nanoparticles. To
realize the true potential of magnetic hyperthermia as a therapy for deep-seated primary and metastatic tumors,
it is necessary to develop nanoparticles that can efficiently accumulate at tumor sites following systemic
administration and generate desirable intratumoral temperatures upon exposure to AMF.
A multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise in nanomedicine, magnetic hyperthermia,
and cancer research will develop novel nanoparticles with high heating capacity that efficiently accumulate in
primary and metastatic tumors following a single systemic injection and generate desirable intratumoral
temperatures upon exposure to AMF. The research team will capitalize on its recent invention of magnetic
nanoclusters consisting of hexagonal-shaped nanoheaters encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles. Preliminary
studies validated that these nanoclusters are safe, efficiently accumulate in subcutaneous cancer tumors after
intravenous injection, elevate the intratumoral temperature to 44 0C in the presence of AMF, and significantly
inhibit tumor growth. To advance this technology, the first major goal of this project is to optimize the developed
nanoclusters for targeted delivery to ovarian and pancreatic cancer tumors by modifying their surface with the
LHRH peptide. The second goal is to confirm, in rodents with metastatic ovarian cancer and orthotopic pancreas
cancer, that the nanoclusters are efficient in increasing temperature of deep-seated primary and metastatic
tumors. The third goal is to validate therapeutic efficacy of the nanocluster-mediated hyperthermia alone and in
combination with chemotherapy in these animal models. These goals will be addressed with the following
Specific Aims: 1. Optimize translational potential and tumor-targeted delivery of the developed nanoclusters. 2.
Evaluate optimized magnetic nanoclusters in mice with human metastatic ovarian cancer. 3. Assess optimized
magnetic nanoclusters in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. At the completion of this project, the team
expects to produce strong evidence that the optimized nanoclusters will efficiently accumulate in metastatic and
deep-seated tumors following intravascular injection, produce the required intratumoral temperature, and
significantly reduce the size of ovarian and pancreatic tumors. The long term goal is to develop a novel magnetic
hyperthermia-based treatment for the tested tumors."

The pathophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with circuit dysfunction in several
cortical regions, (rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), dorsal ACC (dACC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
(vlPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula), and the rostral striatum, that, together integrate information related
to behavioral inflexibility, resulting in persistent avoidance. These structures are referred as ‘nodes’ in the OCD
network (OCDnet). Anatomically these nodes are interconnected extensively to mutually influence each other.
This creates the complex network that underlies the required flexibility for optimizing positive outcomes. Human
imaging studies show that ‘hubs’, defined as regions with unusually high and diverse connectivity, exist within
distributed networks. These hubs are considered important for integrating and distributing information. However,
hubs are defined by imaging which cannot distinguish between inputs to a region that would integrate information,
and outputs of a region that would distribute information. P1 combines quantitative anatomic methods with state-
of-the-art imaging in both NHP and humans to characterize the complexity of the interconnections of the OCDnet
by identifying hub locations, their pathways, and projection zones in the striatum. We hypothesize: 1. that within
each node there are specific regions, based on their connectivity profiles, that can be classified as integrative
hubs (i-hubs), distributive hubs (d-hubs), or both (central hubs-c-hubs); 2. hub projection zones to the striatum
are more expansive compared to nonhub projection zones. Aims 1 & 2 use tracer experiments to locate hubs,
delineate their composition, and locate their fibers within the ALIC, CC, and CB. A3 will use this anatomic data,
coupled with state-of-the-art structural (dMRI) and functional imaging (rsMRI) in NHPs and humans to determine
the location of hubs, their fiber pathways in the ALIC, CC and CB in the human brain."

Differentiating Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is often challenging in real
time. Meanwhile, the poor phenotypic grouping of TTS patients prevents investigation of effective therapeutic
strategies for long-term risk reduction. Built on our current study that already yielded an accurate and broadly
applicable spatiotemporal deep convolution neural network (DCNN) for echocardiographic diagnosis of TTS,
in this proposal, we plan to augment and optimize a DeSeg-TTSD algorithm using large-scale multi-institution
and multi-vendor echocardiographic datasets, as well as clinical metadata to increase the robustness,
generalizability, and interpretability of deep learning modeling in real-time imaging analysis. We also plan to
develop and validate a DeSeg-TTSP model for TTS prognostication and phenomapping by extracting latent
spatiotemporal features correlating with TTS pathophysiology and outcome, so as to develop personalized
treatment.
We hypothesize that, when trained on an echocardiographic video task, a spatiotemporal DCNN can unlock
sub-visual predictive information with advanced learning and computational analysis, to discover distinctive
myocardial motion patterns and assimilate latent spatiotemporal imaging features to improve the accuracy of
diagnosis and prognostication for TTS patients.
The proposed research project brings together multiple innovations: It is based on a solid scientific premise,
builds on already achieved results and extends state of art of spatiotemporal deep learning modeling in real
time imaging, to provide decision support for clinical diagnosis and prognostication using imaging information
routinely available in daily practice. Other than our local research team assembling imaging engineering
experts, cardiologists and statisticians, an inter-institutional team including 57 board-certified expert human
readers will perform human classification, data visualization and evaluate the feasibility of the application and
integration into a clinical setting of the established and validated DL model.
We will fulfill the following specific aims
1: Develop and validate fully automated spatiotemporal DL diagnosis models from echocardiographic videos
that enable discrimination of TTS from AMI in real time.
2: Integrate spatiotemporal DL prognostication into clinical prediction models to endorse long-term TTS
prognostication.
3: Perform data visualization on spatiotemporal DL framework and investigate TTS pathophysiology to develop
personalized treatment
Establishing this spatial-temporal hybridized deep learning framework will become a foundation for the
development of additional precision medicine decision support tools for patients with acute cardiovascular
disorders to address urgently-needed diagnostic decisions, resolve time-sensitive therapeutic dilemmas and
obtain advanced imaging markers to develop specific primary and secondary prevention strategies."

Both bilingualism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are growing more prevalent at a steady rate, highlighting the
urgent need to identify bilingualism's contribution to the language skills of autistic children. Autistic children might be
misdiagnosed as having a language impairment or be at risk of having their language difficulties attributed to
bilingualism, hence delaying the attainability of appropriate services. Backgrounds with multiple risk factors such as low
SES, parental educational level, and unfavorable cultural perceptions might add difficulties to bilingual autistic children's
language development. Research demonstrates similar language development patterns in autistic bilingual and their
monolingual peers; however, it highlights the lack of understanding of their language abilities compared to typically
developing (TD) bilingual children. Most studies to date have been conducted among preschool-aged children, using only
the dominant language; moreover, they have lacked comparison to control groups of TD children and have tended to favor
middle- to high-SES families. To address these gaps, the broad objective of this research is to evaluate the contribution of
different predictors of language skills development in bilingual autistic school-aged children. The first study will develop
an adaptation of the research materials and recruitment strategies to achieve cultural and linguistic competence, with
parents and community stakeholders as informants of the process. The second study will compare structural language
skills in bilingual and monolingual autistic children and age-, gender-, and IQ-matched TD children and determine the
relationships of these skills to sociodemographic, clinical, and cultural factors. The third study will compare perceptions
of the value of bilingualism among parents of school-aged autistic and TD children to identify whether the interplay of
parental perceptions, diagnoses, and other sociodemographic characteristics act as facilitators or barriers to the language
development of bilingual autistic children. Applied thematic analysis will guide the adaptation process to offer a
systematic method to maximize accessibility, feasibility, and acceptability of the research project. For the other two
studies, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and multiple linear regression analyses will examine the effects of
the potential predictors on the language skills of bilingual autistic children. The proposed study will (1) advance our
understanding of the interaction of bilingualism and language abilities in autistic children and (2) potentially inform
standards for language assessments for Spanish-English speaking bilingual autistic children. The expected results will lay
the foundation for an R01 study of bilingual autistic children's specific characteristics related to better outcomes. Our
proposal aligns with the strategic plan of the NICD's mission by identifying clinical, linguistic, and demographic markers
of typical and atypical language development in bilingual autistic children."
10788377,"Obesity and its associated metabolic diseases represent a global health crisis, affecting more than one third of US adults. Studies in humans and animal models indicate that very low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diets (KDs) promote weight loss, improve glucose tolerance, and decrease insulin resistance and intestinal inflammation. While the primary mechanisms involved are thought to be due to a shift in hepatic metabolism from carbohydrates to lipids, the role of extrahepatic cells in mediating the systemic effects of KDs remains unclear. The goal of this RO1 application (PA-19-056) is to test the hypothesis that diet-induced shifts in the host production of ketone bodies selectively inhibit the growth of gut bacteria leading to a decrease in immune cell activation and improved metabolic phenotypes. Our extensive Preliminary Results, together with the growing body of scientific literature in this area, provide strong support for the scientific premise of our hypothesis. This work is conceptually innovative as it shifts the focus from the direct impact of diet on the gut microbiota to the role of host-microbiota interactions in mediating the effects of common diets used to treat human disease. We believe that these studies are also technically innovative as we will leverage the paired genetic manipulation of the host and the gut microbiome, a general goal that remains elusive in the microbiome field for many areas of study. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: (Aim I) the use of a new transgenic mouse model to test the impact of enteric ketogenesis on the gut microbiota; (Aim II) the use of natural strain collections and transposon mutagenesis to evaluate the specificity and genetic determinants of bacterial sensitivity to ketone bodies; and (Aim III) the use of conventional and gnotobiotic mice to test the role of KD-associated bacterial immune activation in diet-induced obesity. This research plan represents a departure from the current focus of the gut microbiome field on macronutrients, expanding the scope of microbiome studies to assess the importance of host-microbiome interactions in modulating the physiological consequences of a given diet. If successful, these studies could significantly advance our long-term goal of developing microbiome-based strategies to treat metabolic disease, with an emphasis on beneficial interactions that might be harnessed to develop the prebiotics and probiotics of the future."

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have achieved unprecedented success in treating blood
cancers that are resistant to traditional radiation or chemotherapies. However, the efficacy of CAR-T therapy to
solid tumors remains limited. Major challenges include poor infiltration of T cells into tumors, exhaustion and low
persistence of T cells under a hostile tumor environment. To tackle these problems, we aim to seek alternative
cell carriers for CAR. Mast cells present several advantages in targeting solid tumors: they reside in tumor tissues
and can live up to years. They can repetitively kill target cells without exhaustion. They also release cytokines
that can recruit other effector cells to kill cancer. In this project, we will design CARs that specifically activate
mast cells to kill solid tumors, using melanoma and colon cancer as models. Our efforts are expected to lay the
scientific foundation for a brand-new cell therapy, and provide rationales and generate reagents for moving
towards further pre-clinical and clinical studies."
10759459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that leads to the loss of visual acuity, resulting in a
substantial medical and social burden. Many unique pathways lead to the pathogenesis of AMD.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a post-mitotic epithelial monolayer which sits directly adjacent to the
photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and is responsible for the maintenance of photoreceptor health. Among
its functions include the generation of 11-cis-retinal chromophore for phototransduction, nutrient delivery, and
diurnal phagocytosis of spent POS. Degeneration and dysfunction in the RPE is linked to the subsequent
decline in photoreceptors seen in diseases such as AMD and Leber’s congenital amaurosis.
Therefore, understanding RPE dysfunction is critical to understanding overall retinal health, but regulation of
these key RPE roles is still incompletely understood. Recent research has pointed to the important role of
microRNA (miR) regulation of gene expression, and miRs are critical for ophthalmic development and
homeostasis. Of these miRs, miR-204 and miR-211 are among the most highly expressed miRs in the RPE
and have been shown to both maintain its epithelial properties and modulate endosomal/lysosomal processing.
These two miRs share the same seed sequence and are hypothesized to regulate many of the same genes,
and are themselves regulated by light and the circadian clock. Previous studies have implicated the expression
of these miRs in the control of RPE phagocytosis, but this has not been fully tested in a RPE specific manner.
Thus, this proposal will examine the role(s) of miR-204 and miR-211 in an RPE specific manner and test the
hypothesis that these two miRs regulate RPE phagocytosis. To pursue these objectives, we have generated
miR-204fl/fl and miR-211fl/fl double knock-in mice. Induction of recombination in double knock-in mice will be
achieved by (1) crossing them with RPE65-ERT2-cre mice and inducing recombination in the resultant triple
knock-in mice by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen; and (2) subretinal delivery of AAV1-CMV-cre-GFP. The
miR double knockout mice will be aged and assessed for phenotypic, electrophysiological, and histological
changes. RPE and retina from these mice will also be collected and analyzed through bulk and single cell RNA
sequencing to examine changes in gene expression resulting from miR-204/miR-211 deletion. The direct
target genes of these two miRs will be assessed through the application of Halo-enhanced Ago2 pulldown
(HEAP). We will also perform the in vitro culture of double knock-in mouse RPE and challenge them with POS
to assess their phagocytic capacity. Lastly, we will correlate the results for mouse RPE to analogous results for
human RPE through the use of RPE cultures derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Overall, these
studies will seek to define the role(s) of miR-204 and miR-211 in the RPE, identify their regulated genes, and
suggest further genes and pathways to target in the development of AMD therapeutics and diagnostics."

Neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), affect
millions of people globally and represent a US major healthcare burden. AD is the world’s most common cause
of dementia, and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. PD is motor disabling condition that advances to
cognitive deficits. Currently there exist no effective therapies for AD or PD; even some of the drugs used to
ameliorate symptoms, such as in PD, cause serious long-term side effects that may be worse than the disease
itself. In AD and PD, accumulation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) or α-Synuclein (α-Syn) and their subsequent aggregation,
cause neuronal toxicity, including neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, leading to
cognitive or motor deficits. In this application, we conceive an innovative genetic tool (named Autophagon, or
AFN) to be developed as a gene therapy that helps target toxic Aβ or α-Syn species to autophagy, an
important degradative pathway that is usually impaired in AD and PD. AFN will feature a synthetic gene
fragment to help sequester Aβ or α-Syn aggregates and deliver them to the autophagic vesicles for clearance
from the neurons. Using viral vectors, we will deliver AFN to cells or to mouse brain via specific stereotaxic
injections. First, we will test AFN in vitro using 2D and 3D (brain organoid) neuronal cultures derived from
iPSCs harboring APP/PSEN1 or α-Syn mutations that drive Aβ or α-Syn aggregation, respectively, and assess
the ability of AFN to suppress aggregate formation and neuronal toxicity. Second, we will use mouse models of
AD (with a genetic knock-in of human APP mutations that cause Aβ aggregation) and PD (expressing
aggregation-prone mutant human α-Syn) to test the therapeutic potential of AFN and its ability to prevent
aggregate formation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive or motor deficits in vivo. If successful, the proposed
project will have a major impact on the neurodegenerative diseases field, by developing an effective potential
gene therapy for AD and PD, and set the foundation for the next steps of preclinical and clinical testing of this
suggested therapy. It may also provide a proof-of-concept for therapy development for other
neurodegenerative disorders associated with protein aggregation."
10759461,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the most common form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. STGD1 is
caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the ABCA4 gene, which encodes a membrane transporter that
removes all-trans-retinals (atRALs) from photoreceptors as part of the retinoid cycle. Free atRALs or their
bisretinoid condensation products promote photo-oxidative damage to the macula as seen in STGD1. The
same atRAL-mediated damage can also be seen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is
expected to affect at least 18 million Americans by 2050. The production of atRAL starts at the level of opsin
proteins, which reside within photoreceptor outer segment disc membranes. Light is captured by opsin-
chromophore complexes, or visual pigments, causing their native bound chromophore, 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL),
to be converted to atRAL and forming activated opsins. These activated opsins initiate phototransduction and
are eventually spontaneously hydrolyzed to apo-opsin and atRAL. Exposure to intense light causes
photoreceptor overstimulation and dangerously high levels of atRAL, potentially leading to photoreceptor
damage and loss. Recently, a chromophore analogue, retinyl formate (RF), was found to irreversibly bind apo-
opsin and form retinyl-opsins that can no longer form visual pigments with 11cRAL. These retinyl-opsins also
absorb light outside the visible light spectrum and do not subsequently release atRAL upon light absorption.
Thus, RF can potentially reduce the proportion of visual pigments in the retina and thereby reduce the atRAL
burden during periods of intense light exposure. Therefore, I hypothesize that RF can serve as a molecular
shade at the opsin level, providing long-lasting protection to photoreceptors from light-induced damage. In this
proposal, I will characterize the site of the retinyl modification on opsin by RF, distinguishing whether RF
binding is competitive or allosteric with 11cRAL. I will determine if and how retinyl-opsins also could initiate the
phototransduction cascade. To investigate its applicability to a pre-clinical model, I will study whether RF
treatment of an STGD1 mouse model provides neuroprotection to photoreceptors against intense light
exposure via formation of retinyl-opsins and reduction of retinal atRAL and determine the relative proportion of
retinyl-opsins and remaining natural visual pigments. This work thus serves as a proof-of-concept approach to
determining whether disabling a proportion of opsins with an irreversible inhibitor of visual pigment formation
could prevent light-induced damage to photoreceptors, and point to the development of future therapeutics and
interventions for STGD1 and AMD."
10759463,"As the average age of the population increases, understanding the biology of longevity and diseases of aging
is increasingly important. The key role of mitochondria in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and pathogenic aging has
been established in studies across species and mechanistically validated using genetically engineered

across species. Higher mtDNAcn is associated with better health outcomes in aging and with increased
longevity, while decreased mtDNAcn is linked to disorders of aging including AD. However, we do not

24-months old that had been fed either standard chow or high-fat diet, and quantify mtDNAcn. In Aim 3, we
will identify relationships between mtDNAcn, age, sex and the familial AD transgenes (5XFAD), using tissue
already collected from the AD-BXD. As part of Aims 2 and 3, we will re-produce a subset of the above strains
and carry out analysis of mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species generation to determine the link
between mtDNAcn and mitochondrial function across tissues. In Aim 4, we will integrate our generated data
with extensive behavioral data on age-related cognitive and other behavioral and CNS changes generated
from BXD and AD-BXD. This will allow us to define loci, candidate genes, and mechanisms of AD and
longevity and to systematically test for associations with age, sex, diet, and linked changes in mitochondrial
DNAcn or function. Finally, we will integrate previously generated -omics data that we have for BXD and other
genomes (e.g., RNA-seq, meth-seq, metabolomes and proteomes) with data from large human AD and
mtDNAcn GWASs, and other existing -omics data. All results will be shared openly using robust internet
services—Mouse Phenome Database, GeneNetwork, etc. Data and workflows will be FAIR-compliant. Key
deliverables are far more quantitative, unbiased, global, and replicable data on genetic, molecular, and
environmental processes that act with mitochondria to mediate cognitive loss, AD and longevity. We will also
deliver causal molecular and mechanistic models that incorporate realistically high levels of genetic diversity—
6 million DNA variants. This work empowers in-depth, unbiased analyses of age-related functional decline
that translates to human populations. Success will provide a platform in which to test novel interventions in
this genomically- and environmentally- replicable population — so called “experimental precision medicine”."
10759370,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has set a goal to become a learning health system to
ensure the consistent delivery of high-quality, safe care to Veterans. A learning health system, per the Institute
of Medicine, harnesses data and analytics to learn from every patient and feed the knowledge to clinicians to
implement with high-reliability. Transforming the VA into a learning health system is vital to Veterans health,
given the wide variation in use of evidence-based practices and Veteran outcomes. The learning environments
in which clinical care is provided can impact these variations. Learning environments are the educational ap-
proaches (e.g., on-line v. unit-based trainings), cultural context, and settings in which teaching, and learning
happen. Supportive learning environments, which are the ideal learning environment, engage employees
through team-based trainings, such as Crew Resource Management, that include communication and team-
work skills and employ highly-reliable work practices (e.g., checklists). Healthcare teams need flexible training
tools that can be easily implemented using available resources to create supportive learning environments.
Until this need is met, one-size fits all approaches will be the dominant educational method in healthcare.
Significance/Impact: The proposed research is significant for its potential to provide teams tailored Crew Re-
source Management tools to create supportive learning environments, resulting in enhanced employee en-
gagement, learning, and Veteran care and its contribution to implementation and learning health science.
Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in that it attempts to shift the current paradigm for learning
from standardized procedurally-focused educational methods that lack communication and teamwork content
to one that provides teams Crew Resource Management tools to change their culture toward learning to en-
hance Veteran care. We will partner with VA cardiac cath labs as a model learning health system for this work.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess how and why VA cath lab learning environments differ. Administer learn-
ing environment surveys to the 81 VA cath labs, assess for changes over time and if learning environments
that are highly supportive are associated with higher employee engagement and safety climate scores. Ob-
serve two consistently supportive and two non-supportive learning environments to understand the basis for
diverse contexts. Aim 2: Adapt Crew Resource Management to the culture, work flow, and learning envi-
ronments of cath labs. Engage advisory panel and stakeholders using nominal, small group technique to
achieve consensus on program design and toolkit components. Assess feasibility, appropriateness, acceptabil-
ity of toolkit. Aim 3: Pilot test the Crew Resource Management-based toolkit at four cath labs over 1
year. Test the feasibility of implementation and collection of evaluation (e.g., adoption, implementation, mainte-
nance) and outcome data (e.g., learning environment, teamwork, and error reporting). Using pre-post interven-
tion data, test the hypothesis that as learning environments become more supportive, there will be a positive
trend in employee engagement, safety climate, and a negative trend in cath lab errors.
Methodology: We will use a mixed methods sequential explanatory design and partner with staff and leader-
ship from the 81 VA cath labs for the proposed research.
Next Steps: The study findings will be the basis for future work to spread and scale up Crew Resource Man-
agement-based toolkits in diverse settings and populations and to study the impact on Veteran outcomes."
10758400,"Chronic pain and spasticity are major unmet needs within the VA. Since our discovery of Nav1.7 as a “master
switch” for pain in humans, the biopharma industry has invested more than $1 billion in development of Nav1.7
blockers. That work is continuing with the development of 2nd-generation blockers that build on our initial efforts
(Cao et al., 2016) and the targeting of Nav1.8 which functions in concert with Nav1.7. We are committed to
more effective, non-addictive treatments for pain and spasticity in Veterans and are taking a “multiple shots on
goal approach” through the following novel efforts.
Research Program I: Pain Pharmacogenomics. A. Pain Resilience—Why do some people experience
severe pain after injury, while others feel little or no pain? We have begun to use our innovative platform of
patient-specific stem cells to identify genes that confer resilience to pain. Thus far we have identified Kv7.2 and
Kv7.3 channels as strong modulators of pain and are analyzing KCNK18. These are potentially druggable
targets. Going forward we will analyze the effect of pharmacological agents on these protective channels as a
prelude to clinical studies. B. Limb Amputation & Phantom Limb Pain in Veterans—Building upon our
success in identifying genetic risk factors in patients with painful neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia and ocular
pain, we now plan to identify genetic risk factors in Veterans with limb amputation and phantom limb pain
(Hannon Act Sect. 305) as a prelude to larger-scale studies in Veterans that capitalize on the MVP database.
Research Program II: Accelerating Toward Improved Pain Pharmacotherapy. A. Chemotherapy-
Induced Pain—We have demonstrated that chemotherapy affects sensory neurons in a drug-dependent
manner and are building a unique collection of animal models to advance this research, which has important
implications for Veterans with CIPN. We are also evaluating cannabinoids as a therapy for CIPN. B.
Osteoarthritis—We are advancing an entirely new approach to treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), an unmet
need in Veterans, having demonstrated that Nav1.7 is upregulated within human OA chondrocytes and
contributes to disease progression. We are now elucidating the actions of Nav1.7 in OA and assessing Nav
blockers in animal models and human tissue to attenuate pain and slow disease progression in OA. C. Novel
Discovery Platforms—We are developing innovative stem cell technology platforms, powerful methods to
visualize transport of single ion channels, and high-throughput assays for drug screening.
Research Program III: New Treatments for Spasticity. We have uncovered ventral horn dendritic spine
dysgenesis as a strong contributor to spasticity following SCI, validated Rac1-Pak1 pathway as a novel target,
and are evaluating the repurposing of FDA-approved Romidepsin to inform human clinical trials (provisional
patent filed through VA TTS). We are developing powerful new methods—intravital visualization of dendritic
spines via spinal cord window implants, high-resolution two-photon microscopy, and virtual reality integration,
to utilize spine dysgenesis as a biomarker as we progress our animal studies toward human clinical trials.
Research Program IV: Targeting Nav1.7 through RNA Editing. Advancing in a multi-pronged approach to
feed the translational pipeline to novel, effective non-addictive treatments for pain, we are developing RNA
editing as a novel approach to target Nav1.7, which remains one of the best validated targets for chronic pain.
Research Program V: Targeting Nav1.8 with Repurposed Drugs. Advancing in a multi-pronged approach
to feed the translational pipeline to novel, effective non-addictive treatments for pain, we are evaluating the
repurposing of two drugs, Dexpramipexole (DEX) and Ambroxol. Ambroxol is known to block Nav1.8, which
works with Nav1.7 to control the firing of pain-signaling neurons. We have shown that DEX blocks Nav1.8 and
reduces pain in several animal models. We will now assess DEX and Ambroxol in a head-to-head comparison
as a prelude to a clinical study using one or the other for the treatment of chronic pain."
10843186,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial survival requires a nearly constant and specific global DNA supercoiling status.
This is achieved by the opposing functions of the DNA-relaxing topoisomerase I and
DNA-compacting DNA gyrase. We propose the first unbiased high-throughput
exploration of genes governing the abundance and activity of these enzymes, which
hold great untapped promise for therapeutic manipulation. How pathogens change
DNA supercoiling during infection conceals vulnerabilities critical to overcoming the
toxic effects of current DNA gyrase inhibitors and emergence of bacteria resistant to
these agents. We will examine mutants of the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium for altered DNA supercoiling in infection-relevant conditions by deploying
Fluorescence Evaluation of DNA Supercoiling – or FEDS – a new high-throughput
method developed in our laboratory that reports the global DNA supercoiling status of
living bacteria. To expose the genetic basis for altered DNA supercoiling, we will identify
the mutated genes and explore genetic interactions among the mutations to reveal
novel instances of synthetic lethality, thereby uncovering both novel genetic pathways
and novel ways to manipulate DNA supercoiling. We will solve the bases for the DNA
supercoiling behavior of the identified mutants by determining the amounts of DNA
gyrase and topoisomerase I as well as the abundance of adenosine triphosphate,
adenosine diphosphate, and specific polyamines – all critical regulators of DNA gyrase
activity. The proposed research program pioneers the physiological understanding of an
essential cellular property exploitable in a wide range of bacterial species to identify
novel targets for antibacterial agents."
10765624,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Although women are known to be disproportionally affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the
underlying biology for this difference is unresolved. Our long-term goal is to help develop therapies that can be
used in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias where inflammation plays a
critical role. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) define the mechanisms that specify the
inflammatory response in the AD brain, and (ii) elucidate whether these are altered in the presence of
circulating hormones. Our central hypothesis is that sex differences in the brain’s immune cells are driven by
sex chromosomes and gonadal steroid hormones, resulting in divergent inflammatory processes and therefore
AD onset and progression. The rationale for this project is that determining how genetic and hormonal
mediators contribute to sex differences in the neuroinflammatory processes in AD will provide a strong
scientific framework whereby new therapeutic strategies can be developed. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the contribution of sex chromosomes to the inflammatory
environment of the AD brain; and 2) Determine the organizational effects of sex hormones in establishing the
inflammatory response in the AD brain. Under the first aim, the 5xFAD mouse model of AD will be combined
with the Four Core Genotype (FCG) mouse to separate chromosomal and gonadal sex in the context of AD.
Inflammation will be assessed using biochemical and molecular techniques to examine immune cell activation
and neuronal health and survival. For the second aim, the brains of 5xFAD mice will be masculinized or
feminized neonatally to ascertain the effects of gonadal hormones on inflammatory processes. The innovation
of this project lies in: 1) the aspects of sex not previously considered in AD models, 2) the contribution of cell
differentiation during development to AD risk in ways not previously considered, and 3) the use of
methodologies to shift the disease paradigm away from protein functional differences towards expression
differences. Providing critical insights to the mechanisms giving rise to immune dysregulation and
neuroinflammation in AD are significant because they have the potential to become the basis for new
therapeutic strategies."
10765631,"Genetic  mutations  in Granulin  (GRN)  that  result  in  reduced  levels  of  its  encoded protein, progranulin  (PGRN),

modulate  FTLD-­related  phenotypes  in  vivo  using  mouse  genetics.  Specifically,  (1)  we  will  first  test  whether

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by severe lung inflammation and carries a
mortality of 30-40%. Some patients recover quickly while others improve slowly and often develop lung fibrosis.
The factors that drive these disparate outcomes are unclear. Pulmonary macrophages play key roles in the
pathogenesis of ARDS by releasing inflammatory cytokines, recruiting neutrophils, and releasing cytotoxic and
apoptotic factors which damage the lung epithelium. I hypothesize that inflammatory programming of pulmonary
macrophages and continuous recruitment of monocytes with inflammatory programming into the lung drive
prolonged inflammation and transient fibrosis in acute lung injury. Aim 1 of this proposal will use an existing
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset generated by the Janssen laboratory to test the hypothesis that
specific recruited monocyte-derived macrophage subsets from a mouse model of prolonged inflammation will
exhibit transcription profiles consistent with perpetuating inflammation and fibrosis. This transcription profile
would include expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic factors. The transcriptional
programming of recruited macrophages in a prolonged inflammation model will be compared to recruited
macrophages from a model of self-limited inflammation. Aim 2 will use a compartment and lineage tracing mouse
model I have optimized to test the hypothesis that prolonged lung inflammation is characterized by continuous
recruitment of monocytes into the airspace and pulmonary interstitium that mature into pro-inflammatory
macrophages, with little proliferation in situ whereas self-limited inflammation is characterized by an early, single
wave of recruitment. Understanding the transcriptional profiles of recruited macrophage populations will provide
insight into the pathophysiology of limited versus prolonged lung inflammation. Defining the kinetics of monocyte
recruitment to the airspace and interstitium in limited versus prolonged inflammation will inform both the
pathophysiology of slowly resolving lung inflammation and the timeline for interventions."

The anemia of critical illness is (ACI) is a frequent complication in the ICU and in burn patients a primary
determinant of transfusion requirements. Poor medical outcomes have been associated with excessive
transfusion in burn patients and have compelled the move to more conservative transfusion protocols. Even
with the institution of a more conservative approach to transfusion, burn patients still require large quantities of
blood. There are no alternatives to reduce transfusion in victims of severe burn or trauma because
erythropoietin (EPO) and iron supplementation do not effectively promote erythropoiesis in these patients. This
is characteristic of an inflammatory anemia such as ACI that involves iron restriction, reduced erythrocyte
lifespan and impairment of erythropoietic activity. The rationale for this proposal is that development of
therapeutic approaches to treat ACI can only be realized with a more complete understanding of inflammatory
mechanisms that drive ACI. The objective of this proposal is to identify the targetable inflammatory
mechanisms that can be exploited to reduce transfusion requirements in the burn unit and ICU. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that post burn ACI develops as a result of impaired EPO signaling and iron
restriction that are mediated by G-CSF and IL-6 secretion that is controlled by inflammatory signaling in the
burn wound. We propose test this hypothesis in three aims that if successful will reveal 1) the inflammatory
networks that initiate post burn ACI, 2) the role of the EBI niche in the pathogenesis of post burn ACI, and 3)
the role of iron restriction in the pathogenesis of post burn ACI. Successful completion of the proposed aims
will identify an axis of cytokines, signaling pathways, and cellular responses that can be targeted with approved
or emerging therapeutics to alleviate post burn ACI."
10928124,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive
decline and pre-symptomatic accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology with older age. AD
pathogenesis is poorly understood, however genetic studies have clearly indicated a causal role for microglia,
the innate immune cells of the CNS. Indeed, GWAS established the innate immune gene CD33 as a risk factor
for Late-Onset AD (LOAD) in 2011. The CD33 LOAD associated rs3865444CC risk genotype is associated with
diminished internalization of amyloid-β1-42 peptide, accumulation of neuritic amyloid pathology and fibrillar
amyloid on in vivo imaging, and increased numbers of human microglia with small, thick processes, and a
rounded morphology compared to the rs3865444AA protective genotype. Individuals with the LOAD associated
rs3865444CC risk genotype have increased expression of full-length CD33, the isoform containing the sialic
acid binding domain, compared to those with the rs3865444AA protective genotype, suggesting that the sialic-
acid binding domain may be critical to the genetic association to AD. Based on the known inhibitory function of
CD33, my hypothesis is that sialic acid mediated CD33 activation leads to microglial suppression, resulting in
the inability to resolve inflammatory processes and mitigate pathogenic amyloid plaques, which may heighten
susceptibility to neuronal loss and contribute to AD progression. To test this hypothesis, our lab developed an
alternative approach for inhibiting CD33 function, by using peptides designed to bind to sialic acid to act as
“decoy” receptors for sialic acid to reduce it’s binding to CD33 and inhibit CD33 signaling. I hypothesize that
competitive inhibition of CD33 with sialic acid will reduce CD33 activation, restore microglial responsiveness,
and increase Aβ uptake. The overarching objective of this proposal is to characterize the binding properties of
these peptides and their inhibitory effects on CD33 activation and signaling (Aim 1) and then examine the
functional responses of these peptides on immune pathways in vitro (Aim 2). In Aim 1, I will determine the
potency and selectivity of peptides 1 and 2 in inhibiting CD33-sialic acid binding in a solid-phase binding assay
I have optimized (Aim1a), determine the critical residues for efficacy through an alanine screen (Aim1b), and
investigate the effects of the peptides on CD33 activation and signaling (Aim1c). In Aim 2, I will look at how
human microglia functionally respond to treatment with peptides 1 and 2 in the context of AD using primary
microglia-like cells from healthy donor and AD patients expressing the CD33 risk and protective genotypes by
measuring gene expression changes in markers of microglial activation and amyloid uptake (Aim2a) and
expression changes in key LOAD-associated immune-related proteins (Aim 2b).These experiments will provide
insights to not only the mechanism of action of these peptides, but also to further clarify the role of CD33 and
Siglec receptors in microglial activation, immune signaling pathways, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
disease."
10837651,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Navigating dynamic environments to avoid danger and locate the necessities of life relies critically on animals
keeping track of their own position and heading within the world, which cannot be sensed directly but instead
must be inferred by integrating many streams of information, including vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual.
Because directional heading has a straightforward mathematical definition (i.e., horizon and azimuth angles),
the sense of direction represents fertile ground for quantitative study of multisensory integration and population
coding in numerous areas of the brain.
In particular, electrophysiological experiments studying the brain's representation of the body's spatial
relationship to the environment have described a class of neurons referred to as head direction (HD) cells,
which each fire when an animal is facing a specific preferred direction. The prevailing model for the generation
of the signal encoded by these cells assumes that information about angular head velocity from the vestibular
system drives activity changes in reciprocally-connected brainstem areas, the dorsal tegmental and lateral
mammillary nuclei. These areas are modeled as a ring attractor network, which can maintain a stable pattern
of activity due to excitatory connections between neurons with similar preferred directions and inhibition
between neurons with opposing preferred directions. However, the main projection from the vestibular nuclei to
the network of brain areas containing HD cells is via the nucleus prepositus, which principally encodes
eye-related rather than head-related information. Thus, it seems likely that eye-related information plays a
substantial role in the generation of the HD signal.
The summation of head-in-world direction with eye-in-head direction defines gaze direction. We thus
hypothesize that the ""head direction"" network in actuality primarily encodes gaze direction. In order to
investigate this hypothesis, I will record from multiple points of the HD network in rhesus macaques during both
passive motion and active locomotion using high-density neural probes while simultaneously tracking eye,
body, and head movements. By analyzing eye, head, and limb movements in conjunction with recordings from
the HD system at multiple stages of information processing, and in particular by recording from large numbers
of neurons at multiple locations simultaneously, this project will provide new insights into fundamental
questions about how the brain represents the world and the body's relationship to it."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by pathological
hallmarks that include dopaminergic neuron death in the substantia nigra, a-synuclein (a-syn) aggregates in
Lewy bodies and neurites, neuroinflammation, and immune cell infiltration into the parenchyma. The
mechanisms which cause neurodegeneration in PD patients are not fully understood. Moreover, the ways in
which immune infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) affects PD pathogenesis are unclear. Previously
published data by our group demonstrates that PD patients have T cells that recognize a-syn, suggesting a role
for autoreactive T cells in PD. This data also identified a risk allele, HLA DRB1*15:01, which binds to the a-syn32-
46 peptide with high affinity. Based on these findings, we tested how activation of the adaptive immune response
to a-syn in the periphery via immunization with a-syn32-46 in HLA DRB1*15:01 expressing mice may cause PD-
like pathology in the CNS. Interestingly, there was no CNS immune or neurodegenerative phenotype, but there
was a constipation phenotype and neuron loss in the intestines. This data suggests that activation of the immune
response against a-syn alone was insufficient to promote immune infiltration and subsequent PD pathology in
the healthy brain. Other mouse models for PD show that a-syn overexpression in the CNS induces infiltration of
T cells from the periphery, but it is unclear how infiltrating a-syn-specific T cells contribute to PD pathology. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that activation of the immune response to a-syn in the periphery in
combination with a-syn accumulation in the brain promotes immune infiltration, neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration. Aim 1 will assess neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration due to the combinatorial effects
of a-syn accumulation in the CNS and peripheral immune activation to the a-syn32-46 peptide using the
established immunization model combined with transgenic and viral a-syn overexpression mouse models. Aim
2 will dissect whether a-syn-specific T cells alone are sufficient to induce neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration using adoptive T cell transfer of a-syn-specific T cells from a-syn-immunized mice into
unimmunized mice which overexpress a-syn in the CNS. The proposed studies will reveal whether autoreactive
a-syn-specific T cells infiltrate the CNS and promote PD pathogenesis. This knowledge may implicate
autoimmunity to a-syn as a major driver of PD, and promote the use of immunomodulatory therapies as a PD
treatment."

Maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is essential for healthy aging and plays a significant role in quality of life.
Age-induced skeletal muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) not only reduces mobility but also increases the propensity
to develop metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Although skeletal muscle atrophy has broad clinical impact
in the increasingly sedentary and aging population, a pharmacologic therapy for muscle mass loss does not
exist. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely induce muscle atrophy by accelerating proteolysis and depressing
protein synthesis. However, ROS refers to a collection of radical molecules whose cellular signals are vast,
and it is unclear which of the downstream consequences of oxidative stress are responsible for the loss of
muscle mass and function that occurs with age or disuse. In this application, we will test our hypothesis that
lipid ROS (LOOH) promotes muscle atrophy through accelerating autophagy/lysosome-dependent protein
degradation. 1) Cellular LOOH is neutralized by phospholipid hydroperoxidase (GPx4), preventing its
accumulation and degradation to form reactive lipid aldehydes. We will determine whether neutralization of
LOOH by N-acetylcarnosine treatment (lipid aldehyde scavenger) will suppress age and/or disuse-induced
skeletal muscle atrophy. 2) Suppression of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) incorporation by
lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3) inhibition prevents LOOH-induced cell death. We will
investigate whether LPCAT3 deletion can protect mice from muscle atrophy, and perform subcellular fluxomics
to examine intracellular fate of LPCAT3 product during oxidative stress. 3) GPx4 deletion increases protein
degradation by accelerating lysosomal degradation. We will test our hypothesis that LOOH supercharges
autophagic machinery by its lipidation with LC3."

Exercise is an extremely effective lifestyle intervention that dramatically lowers the risk for cardiovascular,
metabolic, neoplastic, chronic inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite these beneficial effects,
the modern human lifestyle is highly sedentary and new approaches to understanding and improving exercise
performance are urgently needed. In this proposal, we will take a new approach and investigate physical activity
through the lens of the gastrointestinal tract. In preliminary work using gnotobiotic mice and microbiota depletion
approaches, we have recently discovered a critical role for the intestinal microbiome in regulating exercise
performance. We found that intestinal microbial colonization contributes to the exercise-induced surge in
dopamine in the brain. Dopamine, in turn, is a major element of the reward and reinforcement centers of the
brain that drive the engagement in physical activity. Importantly, elevating dopamine levels in the striatum of
microbiota-depleted mice restores their exercise performance. This effect of the microbiota on the brain during
exercise is dependent on TRPV1+ afferent sensory neurons. These findings provoke the central hypothesis that
that the microbiome effect on exercise performance is mediated by neuronal gut-brain signaling which regulates
the availability of dopamine in the striatum. We will employ an innovative toolbox at the interface of microbiome
science, exercise physiology, and neuroscience to address three central questions:
(1) Which microbial genes and which intestinal metabolites influence exercise performance? (2) Which
dopamine-sensitive neurons respond to exercise and the microbiome to enhance physical activity? (3) Which
sensory neurons transmit the microbiome-derived gastrointestinal signal to the brain to enhance exercise
performance?
Collectively, these studies will mechanistically define elements of a gut-brain pathway linking the commensal
microbiota, gut-innervating sensory neurons, and striatal activity during exercise. Further, the proposed
experiments will provide important pre-clinical evidence on the therapeutic potential of gastrointestinal
interventions, such as diet and microbial modulation, aimed at enhancing physical activity."
10780160,"Abstract: Dry mouth (xerostomia) is one of the most common and severe toxicities that patients
experience after radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer. Xerostomia results from RT-induced
damage to the salivary glands and is associated with difficulties in chewing, swallowing, speaking,
as well as increases in occurrence of dental carries, all decreasing the patient’s quality of life.
Existing methods to prevent xerostomia are often not very helpful to the patient, difficult to
implement, and can cause additional toxicities. In an attempt to reduce the morbidity of treatment,
dose-reduced chemoradiotherapy regimens where patients with favorable-risk HPV-associated
tumors are treated with 60Gy (Chera 2019) compared to the conventional 70Gy have been
introduced. While dose reduction has led to an overall improved symptom profile, xerostomia
remained the most severe patient-reported toxicity. Thus, additional methods to minimize RT-
induced xerostomia are needed. Data suggest that salivary stem/progenitor cells, which
preferentially reside within the large salivary ducts, have the potential to regenerate salivary
glands post-injury. Our hypothesis is that dose sparing of the stem cells within the parotid ducts
will improve patient outcomes compared to conventional parotid sparing (i.e., attempting to limit
the mean dose of the contralateral parotid gland to less than 26Gy). In order to evaluate the utility
of parotid ductal sparing formally, we will conduct a randomized double-blind trial. Patients with
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas will be randomized to receive parotid ductal sparing
(using MRI-sialography to identify the ducts) or conventional parotid sparing RT."
10783078,"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a debilitating condition characterized by compulsive use of a substance, in spite of the subjective recognition of the drawbacks associated with its use. Chronic use of the substance leads to the development of withdrawal and dependence, hindering intentional controls over its use. Among all substances, opioids are among the ones that pose the greatest negative impact on our society. Animal and human studies have implicated several brain regions involved in opioid use disorder (OUD), in particular various components of the dopamine system. Major dopamine-containing neurons are clustered in regions of the midbrain called the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Classically, their activities correlate with valence, e.g., promoting approach behavior to rewarding stimuli. Upstream of them, two major circuits are involved: one including the nucleus accumbens projecting onto the VTA, and the other including the dorsal striatum projecting onto the SNc. The scope of this study is thus to conduct in-depth transcriptomics across the cells of these two circuits to dissect genes, pathways, and cell types mediating opioid action in the mouse brain. 
We will use these data to predict driver genes, regulatory regions, pathways, and cell types involved in the emergence of opioid addiction behaviors. Finally, to test the causal role of these predicted drivers, we will use opioid self-administration, a classical paradigm used in the field of addiction. By combining a rich set of behavioral protocols with state-of-the-art transcriptomics, epigenomics, and computational data analysis, we aim to obtain multi-modal data with an unprecedented level of single-cell resolution for identifying genes, pathways, and cell types affected in mouse models of OUD."
10783081,"The fusion protein AML 1/ETO (AE), resulting from the t(8;21) translocation, is a leukemia-initiating transcription factor that is frequently associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite being defined as a ""favorable"" subtype of AML, many AE positive (AE+) patients relapse and die with largely unknown causes. It is also unclear how AE mediates a disease-predictable DNA methylation signature. The long-term goals are to elucidate further the mechanisms of AE+ AML leukemogenesis, discover new therapeutic targets and develop effective targeted therapies. The objective of this proposal is to explore the molecular basis of a disease-predictable DNA methylation signature underlying AE+ AML with a focus on the impact of hypoxia-independent HIF1alpha-DNMT3a signaling axis activation. The rationale underlying this proposal is that the hypoxia-independent HIF1alpha signaling activation is a new hallmark of cancer. In relation to this project, the hyperactive HIF1alpha signaling may be a disease-promoting factor and an epigenetic mediator in AE+ AML. HIF1alpha forms a feedforward loop with AE and transactivates DNMT3a, another prognostic marker in AE+ AML. HIF1alpha inhibition suppresses AML cell growth. However, the detailed mechanistic and biochemical links between HIF1alpha signaling and AE AML pathogenesis and disease recurrence are poorly defined. The central hypothesis is that HIF1alpha promotes AE leukemogenicity through enhancing AE transcriptional activities and modulating the AE-governed DNA methylation landscape in AML cells; therefore HIF1alpha may be a vulnerable and druggable target in AE+ AML. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1.) Dissect the mechanistic details of how HIF1alpha is critical for AE-driven leukemogenesis; 2) Determine the role of HIF1alpha in AE-dependent DNA methylation; 3) Test pharmacological targeting of HIF1alpha as a therapeutic option for AE+ AML. To pursue our aims, we will use innovative combinations of biological techniques with unique transgenic and patient-derived xenograft (POX) mouse models, as well as innovative integration of aberrant HIF1alpha signaling and epigenetics in understanding and treating AE+ AML. The proposed research is significant, because it will disclose new genes/mechanistic pathways that are necessary for AE leukemogenicity, identify the therapeutic biomarkers, and discover new medicinal agents for AE+ AML. Further, it will thoroughly investigate the epigenetic and oncogenic role of HIF1alpha in cancer. The proximate expected outcomes are to demonstrate HIF1alpha-epigenetics crosstalk in defining AE-initiated transcriptional regulation and leukemia pathogenesis, and to establish the feasibility of using HIF1alpha inhibitors to enhance the therapeutic index of the existing treatment regimens. The results will have an important impact because they will advance our understanding of AE+ AML molecular pathology, aberrant epigenetics in leukemia and the oncogenic functions of hypoxia-independent HIF1alpha signaling in cancers. The findings will also lay the groundwork to develop newer strategies to better target AE+ AML."
10780298,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Injured corneal nerves can regenerate but in general, the resulting nerve repair is incomplete or may take
years to recover their original density and patterning. While several growth factors can enhance the
recovery of damaged corneal nerves and one of them has been clinically approved to treat corneal injuries
(nerve growth factor), patients still complain about discomfort, dryness, and pain. These observations
indicate that more complete anatomical and sensory regeneration of injured nerves may need to occur for
patients to recover. Most likely the type/site/time of nerve injury affects the anatomical, molecular, and
functional regeneration of corneal nerves. Therefore, the administration of clinically validated factors that
enhance nerve regeneration, not only accelerates the rate of healing but also induces differential effects
on functional nerve sensation. Since regeneration of corneal nerves requires multiple wound healing
processes, the use of single agents may not be the best therapeutic approach, and combination of factors
with similar or complementary roles may be necessary to accomplish repair at the morphological and
functional levels.
 In this proposal, we hypothesize that secreted extracellular vesicles (including exosomes)
derived from different sources differentially regulate the anatomical, molecular, and functional
aspects of regenerating corneal nerves. To identify these changes, we proposed the following: Aim
1 will characterize the ability of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) to promote the anatomic and molecular regeneration of corneal nerves following mechanical
and chemical injury. Aim 2 will evaluate the functional and behavior recovery of corneal nerves following
administration of EVs. Aim 3 will elucidate the bioactive components of the extracellular vesicle’s cargo,
which can lead to new therapeutic approaches for complete corneal nerve repair."
10771099,"This proposed project will develop tests and methods for assessment of cognitive status in deaf older adults
(aged ≥65), focusing primarily on those who use both American Sign Language (ASL) and written English to
communicate. In spoken language bilinguals, sensitivity to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is maximized when
testing occurs in the dominant language, but it is not known if this applies to bilingual deaf seniors, a group that
presents many challenges for assessment and diagnosis. Few tests have been developed for administration
with deaf signers, and vanishingly little is known about the behavioral presentation of AD in this population. In
Aim 1 we will develop tests of language proficiency, list memory, and executive function (i.e., Stroop) that can
be administered in ASL or English. We will investigate which language maximizes test performance in deaf
ASL-English bilinguals, information we believe is critical for avoiding a false-positive diagnosis of AD. Many
seniors who were pre-lingually deaf suffered language deprivation that could alter the behavioral presentation
of AD since they lacked full access to a spoken language and their use of sign language was discouraged. In
Aim 2 we will test a small sample of deaf signers with probable AD to determine which language of testing
maximizes differences between patients and controls (tested in Aim 1), and if deaf signers with probable AD
exhibit patterns of impairment found in hearing AD (including reduced delayed recall, reduced primacy effects,
increased proactive interference on list memory tests, and increased errors on Stroop tests). We will also
conduct a detailed exploratory linguistic analysis of proficiency narratives, aiming to identify how AD affects
production of more complex and naturalistic forms of language in deaf signers. In Aim 3 we will examine the
possible effects of language deprivation and speech/sign bilingualism on cognitive reserve by recruiting 2
additional comparison groups of cognitively healthy monolingual seniors: those with normal hearing and those
with late-onset aging-related deafness. Individuals who lost their hearing late-in-life have reduced exposure to
linguistic interactions because of their hearing loss, and this increases their dementia risk. Comparison of
these groups will provide a unique lens on the possible effects of early versus recent language deprivation on
cognition. Participation of seniors with aging-related deafness will also increase the potential significance of the
proposed work by providing data on written English tests which may be useful for assessment of monolingual
seniors with late-life hearing loss. This project will constitute a major advancement in tests and procedures for
cognitive assessment of older deaf signers, a historically disadvantaged group, will improve understanding of
how diverse linguistic backgrounds may alter the behavioral presentation of AD, and will contribute to the NIA
mission to “Understand health disparities related to aging and develop strategies to improve the health status
of older adults in diverse populations” (in Strategic Directions for Research, Goal F)."
10771101,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, frequently dose-limiting side-effect of
chemotherapeutic drugs. CIPN can be excruciatingly painful, profoundly debilitating, cause permanent disability,
and lead some patients to elect to end life-saving treatment. In contrast to other side effects, CIPN frequently
lasts well beyond the duration of treatment and can cause permanent disability. Consequently, therapies are
urgently needed as they would not only enhance the quality of life of cancer patients both during and after
treatment, but also improve cancer therapy by permitting effective chemotherapeutic dosing. To address this
need we have developed mechanism-based interventional strategies for CIPN.
Chemotherapy-induced neuropathies are characterized by axonal degeneration, which leads to the unpleasant
symptoms of neuropathies. We have shown that vincristine and bortezomib, two widely used chemotherapeutic
agents with different mechanisms of action act via the neuronal protein SARM1, the central executioner of a
genetically encoded axon degeneration program. Activated SARM1 cleaves the metabolic cofactor NAD+,
leading to local NAD+ depletion, followed by metabolic collapse and axon fragmentation. We here present several
new strategies to block this final common pathway to axon degeneration. We generated a SARM1
dominant/negative that potently inhibits SARM1 function and axon degeneration. We will utilize adeno-
associated virus (AAV) -mediated expression of a SARM1 dominant-negative to block SARM1 activity and will
assess the effect of SARM1-dominant/negative on axon degeneration, neuroinflammation and functional
outcomes. We have shown in vitro that boosting the synthesis of NAD+ strongly protects against vincristine and
bortezomib-induced axon degeneration. We will use virus-mediated expression of enzymes of the NAD+ salvage
pathway to boost NAD+ synthesis, which counters the axon destructive effects of SARM1. As a further step to
translation to the clinic, we will evaluate in mouse models of cancer whether our therapeutic strategies interact
with the cancer or chemotherapy and are effective in cancer-bearing mice. Success of our experiments will lead
directly to clinically viable means to prevent and treat CIPN."
10771102,"Complex carbohydrates are essential biopolymers ubiquitously expressed in all kingdoms of life. On cell
surfaces, they usually perform architectural functions by fortifying the cell boundary, aiding in osmo-regulation,
defining an extracellular matrix, and mediating cell-to-cell communications, among many other roles. We
understand fairly well how polypeptides are transported across or integrated into biological membranes. Similar
mechanisms for polysaccharides, which range from acidic to water-insoluble hydrophobic polymers, remain
mostly unexplored, despite playing critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes. My
research seeks to fill this gap. We integrate structural biology approaches with biochemistry, glycobiology,
biophysics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology to delineate how high molecular weight complex
carbohydrates are synthesized and deposited on the cell surface. Leveraging microbial, viral, plant and
vertebrate model systems, we provide atomistic descriptions of mechanistically distinct secretion systems.
Understanding these processes on a molecular level aids novel drug and biomaterial developments. This
proposal combines two research directions on microbial extracellular polysaccharides synthesized and
secreted by fundamentally different mechanisms. First, cellulose, a linear glucose polymer, is an important
biofilm component of many enterobacteria, including E. coli. Biofilms pose a particular threat to human health,
causing ~80% of nosocomial infections. Cellulose is synthesized by a ‘synthase-dependent’ pathway in which
a membrane-embedded enzyme synthesizes and secretes the polymer. Most enterobacteria modify cellulose
with phosphoethanolamine during secretion to stabilize it on the cell surface. We provided the first insights into
the molecular organization of the supramolecular cellulose synthase complex. Our future research direction will
address how cellulose biosynthesis is controlled, how cellulose is modified in the periplasm, and how it is
transported across the periplasm and the outer membrane. Second, Gram-negative bacteria are protected by
an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the extracellular leaflet. LPS molecules contain
variable O antigen polysaccharides that significantly extend the bacteria’s outermost protective coat and
provide survival benefits to many human pathogens. Prior to attachment to the conserved LPS core, O
antigens are completely assembled on a lipid linker inside the cell and transported to the periplasm by an ATP-
fueled ABC transporter, called WzmWzt. We currently lack any mechanistic insights into how ABC transporters
translocate biopolymers, such as polysaccharides, teichoic acids and polypeptides, which are all potent
virulence factors. Our X-ray and cryo electron microscopy structures of WzmWzt in O antigen-free states
provided the first insights into the transporter’s function. We now seek to determine the mechanism by which O
antigens are secreted. This will be accomplished biochemically by reconstituting O antigen translocation in
vitro, and structurally by determining snapshots of WzmWzt during substrate translocation."
10771103,"ABSTRACT
Resistance to targeted therapy is a major challenge in oncology and barrier improving patient survival. As a
paradigm-defining example, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in many EGFR-mutated non
small-cell lung cancer patients. However, promising initial responses in these patients are always followed by
the development of acquired resistance, most often a lethal event. The cellular basis for this stems from an
incomplete initial response forming a reservoir of residual disease caused by tumor cell persistence and drug
tolerance, through poorly understood mechanisms. In extensive preliminary data we discovered that the
persistence and drug tolerance of EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells is dependent on a mitotic stress response
elicited by drug treatment. Drug tolerant tumor cells are dependent on continued mitotic stress signaling, and
are vulnerable to Aurora Kinase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Tumor samples from patients progressing on
EGFR inhibitors frequently displayed evidence of ongoing stress signaling, often co-occurring with other
genetic changes commonly associated with drug resistance. Here we seek to mechanistically dissect how this
stress signaling aids in tumor cell persistence and acquired resistance and the role it plays in shaping tumor
evolution after therapy. We will test the hypothesis that stress from acute oncogene withdrawal drives the
unexplained and key features of drug tolerance and residual disease during EGFR TKI treatment that is:
cellular adaptation and resistance to apoptosis (Aim 1) and the catalysis of genetic evolution leading to the de
novo gain of resistance causing mutations (Aim 2). Finally, this knowledge will be used to identify new
therapeutic strategies to forestall tumor evolution by limiting stress signaling (Aim 3). To address this
hypothesis, our team consists of experts in lung cancer, systems biology and clinical translation and will use
innovative new single cell approaches, live cell imaging, state-of-the-art animal and organoid models and
patient samples. Our goal is to lay the mechanistic groundwork that shifts the paradigm from the current
reactionary approach of targeting acquired resistance after it emerges to a proactive approach that targets
sources of residual disease to prevent acquired resistance."
10771157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder with severe societal consequences that impacts
over 15 million adults in the USA and 76 million worldwide. Ethanol exposure early in life, particularly in utero,
strikingly alters fetal brain development and increases the risk for AUD. Even exposure to low concentrations of
ethanol can produce the most prevalent, milder forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Our recent studies in
the rat demonstrate that prenatal exposure to low levels of ethanol, in addition to increasing ethanol consumption
and anxiety in the offspring, stimulates neurogenesis with negligible cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, prenatal
ethanol stimulates the density of neurons expressing hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt), an orexigenic neuropeptide
located almost exclusively in the hypothalamus that has a major role in promoting AUD-related behaviors. These
compelling effects observed in our rodent model led us to seek a simpler vertebrate model to investigate in real-
time, at cellular and anatomical levels, the mechanisms involved in ethanol’s effects on embryonic development
of Hcrt neurons. The zebrafish (ZF) is a perfect vertebrate model system for our studies, due to its optical
accessibility and external development, its small size and low cost, and its comparable CNS that develops early
and rapidly alongside a relatively sophisticated behavioral repertoire. With our recent publications showing a
conservation of ethanol’s effects across species, we established in our laboratory a variety of techniques
particularly suited for comprehensive studies of the ZF brain, including time-lapse live imaging, optogenetics,
calcium imaging, and in vivo targeted laser ablation, and obtained preliminary results revealing robust and
unexpected changes in Hcrt neurons and neuroimmune systems that may lead to the formation of specific
asymmetric Hcrt subpopulations. Based on these new findings, we propose to test the following hypothesis:
Embryonic exposure to ethanol at low doses has diverse effects on the development of Hcrt neurons, which are
mediated by dynamic changes in local inflammatory chemokine systems and contribute to the formation of
asymmetric, abnormally-located Hcrt subpopulations that exhibit altered neural activity and are causally related
to disturbances in ethanol consumption and associated behaviors. In 3 specific aims, we plan in ZF embryonically
exposed to low-dose ethanol: 1) to thoroughly characterize Hcrt neuronal development along with behavior,
under normal conditions and after ethanol exposure, and directly test the behavioral functions of these neurons;
2) to precisely determine, at a single-cell level, if Hcrt neurons in specific subpopulations are unique in their birth
date, site of origin, migratory path, and signaling activity, and if they are causally related to behavioral
disturbances; and 3) to test the possibility that effects of embryonic ethanol on Hcrt neuronal development and
behavior are mediated by local neuroimmune systems, specifically CXCL12a/CXCR4b/CXCR7b and
CCL2/CCR2. This research aims to elucidate in depth the dynamic and diverse neuropeptide, neuroimmune and
behavioral changes caused by low levels of in utero ethanol exposure that increase the risk for AUD."
10778949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sensorineural deafness is typically caused by the irreversible loss of the inner ear hair cells (HCs). Currently,
there is no treatment available to reverse the loss of HCs. Recent advance in regenerative medicine offers
promise in treating sensorineural deafness through HC regeneration. Elucidating the molecular mechanism
underlying the formation of the inner ear HCs will aid our effort to regenerate HCs and restore hearing. During
early cochlear development, the partially overlapping expression of GATA3, ISL1, ISL2, and their negative
regulators, LMO3 and LMO4, suggests a novel model for the regulation of cochlear duct patterning and
sensory formation, in which the expression of GATA3, ISL1, and ISL2 makes the ventral cochlear epithelium
competent to form the sensory region and the expression LMO3 and LMO4 suppresses the transcriptional
activity of ISL1, ISL2, and GATA3 in all but the presumptive prosensory domain. Consistent with this model, we
have shown that targeted deletion of Lmo4 leads to the formation of an ectopic organ of Corti completed with
inner and outer HCs and supporting cells in the presumptive external sulcus. Loss of Lmo4 also results in a
broader expression domain of CDKN1B, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and an early marker of the
developing sensory organ. Conversely, deletion of Gata3 impairs the formation of the sensory domain and
leads to the loss of CDKN1B expression. Interestingly, our preliminary study showed that while loss of Isl1 or
Isl2 alone has no significant effect on the formation of prosensory domain, compound Isl1/Isl2-null mutation
abolishes the CDKN1B-expressing prosensory domain, suggesting that Isl1 and Isl2 could function redundantly
in specifying prosensory region. To further understand the role and mechanism of ISL1 and ISL2 in
determining the prosensory domain in the cochlea, we will knock out Isl2 and Isl1/Isl2 specifically in the inner
ear and assess the effect on cochlear duct patterning and sensory formation. In addition, we will knock out
Lmo3 and Lmo4 specifically in the inner ear and investigate their function during cochlear duct patterning and
sensory formation. To understanding the underlying functional mechanism, we will use RNA-Seq, snRNA-
Seq/snATAC-Seq, and CUT&Tag technologies to identify candidate genes that are directly controlled by ISL1,
ISL2, and GATA3 in the ventral cochlear epithelium. Together, this study will provide significant information
about the molecular events underlying sensorineural deafness, accelerate the discovery of novel sensorineural
deafness genes, and aid our effort to regenerate inner ear HCs to restore hearing. Additionally, elucidating the
novel interaction among the LIM-HD, LMO, and GATA proteins will advance our knowledge of their roles in the
development and pathogenesis of the inner ear and other tissues."
10779007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deformities of the hindfoot, including planovalgus, are common with cerebral palsy causing pain and limiting
function. It is common when these patients are children to correct planovalgus deformity and improve alignment
by surgically treating them with calcaneal osteotomies and subtalar fusions. However, long-term follow-up of
adults living with cerebral palsy is limited. It is unknown what is driving the progression of deformity; it could be
driven by the underlying bony morphology, altered neurologic control, or a combination of form and function that
induces abnormal kinematics. Long-term assessments of foot reconstructions performed in childhood are
important because continued growth and weight gain throughout puberty into adulthood can impede lasting
improvements. Adults with cerebral palsy are underserved and there have been limited long-term studies
investigating these childhood surgical interventions and their lasting effects as these patients transition to
adulthood. Evaluating hindfoot kinematics during activities of daily living in adults with cerebral palsy is essential
for understanding pathological foot conditions and the impact of past surgical interventions on long-term function.
Biplane fluoroscopy provides a means to track in vivo motion of individual bones and measure joint kinematics.
Yet, there lacks a robust standard for measuring and comparing kinematics across studies and conditions,
especially in cases where deformity greatly affects bone morphology. Therefore, we propose two aims: 1)
Standardize foot and ankle methods for data collection and kinematic model development using biplane
fluoroscopy, and 2) Evaluate adults with cerebral palsy who have previously been surgically treated with a
calcaneal osteotomy (Even’s lengthening) or subtalar fusion using the standardized methods in collaboration
with Marquette University and Shriner’s Hospital for Children – Chicago to evaluate their long-term effectiveness.
Our ultimate clinical research goal is to improve the orthopaedic management of foot deformities for individuals
with cerebral palsy. Our mission is to conduct research to discover new knowledge that improves the quality of
care and quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy. The long-term focus of this project will address outcomes as
these patients grow into adulthood and achieve independence. This project clinically aims to identify long-term
surgical correction strengths and deficiencies in adults living with cerebral palsy who underwent one of these
two surgical treatments with the purpose to use this knowledge to guide future clinical decision-making. The
secondary technical aim is to publish and provide standardized methods for evaluating tibiotalar and subtalar
motion to facilitate additional future multi-center research studies to commonly evaluate surgical outcomes in the
foot and ankle."
10747381,"Abstract: The etiology of obesity is complex and is driven by different factors in different populations,
including across developmental stages, in different racial and ethnic communities, and at different levels of
socioeconomic status (SES). It is important to identify the factors that promote excess energy intake in the
highest risk populations to develop evidence-based, effective obesity prevention and treatment strategies.
Over the past decade, it has become apparent that studying behavioral phenotypes that predict overweight,
obesity, and weight change across the lifespan is critical for developing individualized intervention strategies
with a high degree of efficacy and effectiveness. One novel phenotype that has been identified and
characterized is sensitization of the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food. This is defined as an increase in
the RRV of a food after repeated, daily consumption of high energy density (HED) food for two weeks. In
adults, sensitization is positively associated with BMI and prospectively predicts weight gain over time. The
cross-sectional relationship between zBMI and sensitization has been replicated in a cohort of adolescents
enrolled in the UBSNAK study and recent data have shown that, as in adults, sensitization prospectively
predicts zBMI change in adolescents. It is also known, from preliminary work, that the relationship between
food insecurity and zBMI is associated with other individual, behavioral, and environmental factors, such as
delay discounting, perceived stress, and self-efficacy for healthy eating. The goals of the proposed study are
1) to investigate the relationship between food insecurity and sensitization 2) to determine the role of
sensitization in determining zBMI and zBMI change in a population of moderate to low-income adolescents
and 3) to determine how adolescent food insecurity interacts with household food insecurity to moderate the
relationship between sensitization and zBMI change. The first aim will test the hypothesis that food insecurity
is related to sensitization and that this relationship is mediated by individual, behavioral, and environmental
factors. The second aim will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity moderates the relationship
between sensitization and zBMI change over time in adolescents. The third aim will test the hypothesis that
adolescent food insecurity interacts with household food insecurity to moderate the relationship between
sensitization and zBMI change and that one factor that impacts this relationship is adolescent eating
autonomy. When taken together, this study will help to identify and characterize novel intervention targets in a
population of adolescents at higher risk for overweight and obesity."
10747382,"Within existing national surgical quality improvement (QI) programs, there are numerous opportunities to
improve the efficiency of data flow from the point of collection to the time at which performance-based
feedback is provided to stakeholders. Current limitations of the QI data cycle include: (a) reliance on hand
abstraction for data collection; (b) a retrospective and episodic (e.g.: quarterly, bi-annually, etc.) approach to
analysis and feedback which creates a time lag from when the hospital’s performance is declining and when it is
made aware; (c) small clusters of clinically meaningful poor performance may go of undetected using current
episodic analytic structures. To address the first limitation, modern data science methods (MDSMs) could be
used to automate the collection of some, or all, of the variables within surgical QI registries. Full or partial
automation of data collection could allow the substantial resources currently committed to manual data
abstraction to be repurposed to support more continuous, proactive engagement in local QI activities. To
address the limitations associated with episodic performance evaluation, alternative approaches for analyzing
data in more real-time could be applied to provide an early warning of declining performance. The Veterans
Affairs (VA) Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) is one of the most successful and longest-
standing national clinical registries used for surgical QI and has been the template for a number of similar
programs in the private sector. As such, VASQIP represents an excellent model for evaluating alternative
approaches to data collection and analysis that could allow for more efficient data flow through the quality
improvement cycle and enhance national surgical QI efforts. The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate
alternative, potentially more efficient strategies that can be readily implemented within the existing
infrastructure of contemporary surgical QI programs and aid in the more efficient flow of data. The specific
aims are to: (1) develop and validate MDSMs to use structured and unstructured electronic health record data
to automate cardiac VASQIP data collection; (2) compare the risk-adjusted CUSUM (a statistical process
control methodology borrowed from industry) to quarterly observed-to-expected ratios (i.e.: VASQIP’s current
approach to assessing performance) for evaluating VA hospital cardiac surgical performance; (3) conduct semi-
structured interviews with diverse stakeholder groups to set a national research agenda for expansion and
improvement of surgical QI programs. This mixed-methods proposal will involve observational studies using
VASQIP and VA Corporate Data Warehouse data for patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a VA hospital
between 2016 and 2020 as well as qualitative interviews with stakeholders who can help to inform future
changes that can improve the data available within VASQIP. This project is important and novel because it will
provide real-world, generalizable data that can be used to inform national surgical and non-surgical QI
initiatives within VA and the private sector."
10747395,"Cytosolic mislocalization of the RNA binding protein TDP43 and neuronal hyperexcitability are cardinal
features of TDP43-related frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Nuclear
exclusion and cytosolic deposition of TDP43 are found in over half of those with FTD, and nearly 95% of those
with ALS, but the origin of these changes remains unknown. Likewise, neuronal hyperexcitability is a
ubiquitous finding in FTD/ALS patients, in vivo and in vitro disease models, yet the cause and consequences of
this phenomenon are unclear. Our preliminary data show for the first time an intrinsic connection between
TDP43 deposition and neuronal hyperexcitabilty that may play a pivotal part in the neurodegeneration
observed in TDP43-related FTD/ALS. Elevated neuronal activity upregulates an uncommon TDP43 isoform
that lacks the canonical, low-complexity carboxy-terminus of the protein. Due to its active nuclear export and its
ability to bind full-length (fl)TDP43, This shortened (s)TDP43 isoform is actively exported from the nucleus,
accumulates in cytosolic aggregates, and sequestrates full-length (fl)TDP43, thereby recapitulating TDP43
pathology in FTD/ALS. Our central goal with this project is to determine the impact of sTDP43 in FTD/ALS
pathogenesis, with a long-term objective of defining novel and effective therapeutic strategies targeting TDP43
homeostasis. We will test the hypothesis that sTDP43 drives neurodegeneration in TDP43-related FTD/ALS by
three specific aims. First, we will take advantage of an sTDP43-specific antibody that we developed to
determine the prevalence and distribution of sTDP43 accumulation in a large cohort of sporadic and familial
FTD/ALS cases curated by the University of Michigan Brain Bank. We will also investigate the impact of
sTDP43 on RNA homeostasis, and determine the relationship between sTDP43, stress, and stress granules in
disease models. Lastly, we will assess the contribution of sTDP43 to neurodegeneration in rodent primary
neurons and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from patients carrying FTD/ALS-associated
C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion mutations. At the completion of these studies, we will have delineated a
unique disease mechanism leading to neurodegeneration in TDP43-related FTD/ALS, and highlighted potential
therapeutic approaches focusing on the abnormal activity-dependent production of toxic TDP43 isoforms."
10747396,"Project Summary: Poor diet and sedentary behaviors are associated with some of the leading causes of
premature death in the U.S. While nutritionists understand that there are a variety of eating behaviors that have
positive benefits to health and function in general terms, it has been difficult to tailor dietary recommendations to
the individual. Public health recommendations and marketing that aim to improve ‘diet quality’ (or complementary
outcomes, such as physical activity) have been hampered by a broad brush ‘one-size fits all’ approach without
distinguishing individualized needs. A big challenge to design of strategies for more personalized public health
is the paucity of large-scale interventions that have tested person-to-person differences in physiological
responses to standardized foods or diet patterns. The premise of the NIH Nutrition for Precision Health program
and this application to establish the California Partnership for Personalized Nutrition Clinical Center is that
variance in dietary patterns and physiological responses to patterns and specific foods are shaped by disparate
factors including complex genetic, microbiome, psychosocial, human ecology, and metabolic variables. We aim
to examine which factor or combination of factors influence responses to a test meal composed of strategic
ingredients that interrogate multiple biological systems in parallel, population-wide but with a consideration of
sub-groups that differ with respect to glucose control and microbiome (type 2 diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-
diabetic persons). In addition, the differential (intra- and interindividual) responses to three disparate diets
(Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, and high-carbohydrate) will be tested in free-living and domiciled conditions,
to characterize microbiota shifts and to associate diet with changes in multi-system physiology and
chronobiology. Finally, the study design also provides biospecimens for metabolomics, chemistry, and
microbiome; advanced metabolic physiology data; innovative app and wearable derived data; in addition to core
protocol EMR and genomic data suitable for high quality data modeling and advanced statistical/artificial
intelligence “big data” methods for discovery of personalized nutritional optimization.
The California Partnership for Personalized Nutrition established in this project grows out of the California
Precision Medicine Consortium (CAPMC), the All of Us Health Provider Organization in California,. The CAPMC
has established teamwork Statewide for recruitment and retention, with engagement of the great diversity of the
population of the State of California. This team, combined with the considerable experience in clinical nutrition,
feeding studies and micro- and macro-nutrient assessment, digital app and wearable technologies, modern

10747397,"In response to RFA-MH-21-170, we propose to expand and enhance a longstanding scientific resource, the
CNS HIV Antiretroviral Effects Research (CHARTER) project. The new longitudinal resource, CHARTER Plus,
will enable research on the neurologic, cognitive, psychiatric, and drug use disorders that afflict people with HIV
(PWH) across their lifespan. The resource will be guided by scientific themes that reflect the priorities of the
Office of AIDS Research and the funding agencies. By combining extensive assessments that focus on the
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework and the collection of multiple biospecimens (including
cerebrospinal fluid), CHARTER Plus will provide an unparalleled weapon in the fight against neuroHIV. Approved
requestors will receive data, biospecimens, and scientific expertise from the resource to support innovative
research. To extend the existing rich resource, we propose to comprehensively assess a cohort of 500 adults
twice over five years. The cohort will consist of four subgroups: 1) 200 PWH who have been followed in
CHARTER for nearly two decades and previously underwent comprehensive assessments; 2) 100 new PWH
diagnosed within the past 10 years on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART); 3) 100 new people without HIV
(PWoH) with comparable demographic and risk behavior characteristics, including drug use; and 4) 100 new
PWoH older than 50 years, particularly those at elevated risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.
Combined, these subgroups will enable users of the resource to address many of the key knowledge gaps that
currently exist in the neuroHIV field. Our longitudinal evaluations will use domain-based cognitive, behavioral,
emotional, and neuropsychiatric assessments that map onto the RDoC framework. Assessments will also include
neuromedical data; drug use characterization; mechanistic biomarkers, viral and host genetic data, including
indicators of HIV activity; and neuroimaging on a subset of 200 participants. The CHARTER Coordinating Unit
will provide central support of study operations including training and certification of personnel; coordination of
recruitment, assessments, and retention; data entry, storage, and quality control/assurance; and biospecimen
management. We have a nearly 20-year history of managing CHARTER and processing investigator requests
in collaboration with the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) Data Coordinating Center (DCC), with
which we have worked since its inception. The need for this resource is clear. Even though therapeutic advances
have greatly benefitted PWH, their healthspan remains markedly compromised; they experience medical,
neurological, and psychiatric disabilities much more frequently than PWoH. Experts debate whether these poor
outcomes result from HIV itself, its immunological effects, premature senescence, syndemic conditions such as
drug use, or combinations of these and other factors. The biological mechanisms underpinning these disorders
remain incompletely defined, and effective therapies beyond ART are sorely lacking. The proposed resource
responds well to RFA-MH-21-170 and will be a critical tool for advancing future neuroHIV research."

 Obesity is highly prevalent in the United States, yet available treatment options remain limited. The
peptide hormone amylin, which reduces food intake and body weight, is thought to be a promising potential
target for novel obesity treatments. As obesity is driven in part by overconsumption of highly palatable,
rewarding foods, there is growing interest in examining how feeding-relevant signals such as amylin act at
reward-relevant nuclei of the brain to control food intake. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the mesolimbic
reward system is both physiologically and pharmacologically relevant for amylin-mediated suppression of food
intake, but the behavioral and physiological mechanisms by which VTA amylin promotes negative energy
balance remain unresolved. This proposal is designed to evaluate mechanisms by which VTA amylin
signaling suppresses intake of particular dietary macronutrients to promote negative energy balance.
Studies also further investigate sex differences in VTA amylin-mediated control of feeding and body
weight, with particular focus on the influence of estradiol on the effects of VTA amylin receptor
activation. Specific Aim I will test mechanisms by which VTA amylin signaling modulates dopamine signaling
to suppress intake of particular dietary macronutrients. First, the hypothesis that VTA amylin receptor (AmyR)
activation potently suppresses phasic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core, another key mesolimbic
nucleus, in response to intraoral fat will be evaluated with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. We will also investigate
the relative contribution of orosensory versus postingestive feedback to activation of VTA AmyR-expressing
dopamine neurons. Further, we will use a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to knock down AmyR
expression in VTA dopamine neurons, and examine how this neuronal population contributes to endogenous
control of energy balance by amylin. Specific Aim II addresses a critical gap in the literature by evaluating
physiological and pharmacological relevance of VTA AmyR in control of palatable food intake and body weight
in females, and will test the influence of estradiol on the energy balance effects of VTA AmyR signaling. We
will also evaluate how estradiol alters expression of AmyR components in the VTA, thereby providing novel
mechanistic insight into central interactions of estradiol and amylin in energy balance control. These studies
build upon the PI’s previous K01 and R03 awards by investigating the neural and behavioral mechanisms by
which mesolimbic amylin signaling promotes negative energy balance and will address new aspects of this
area of research by providing deeper insight into the mechanisms by which VTA amylin signaling controls
macronutrient intake as well as sex differences in these effects. Collectively, these studies will provide
information on mechanisms of action by which amylin reduces food intake and promotes weight loss, which
may in turn facilitate the development of more effective pharmacotherapies for treating obesity."

My lab’s contributions have helped bring lung biology to the forefront of stem cell biology. Our major focus has
been to develop tools to characterize progenitor cells in the adult lung and in lung cancer; I now aim to develop
this expertise for applications in lung diseases. We created three-dimensional co-culture organoid systems
that have begun to define cell-cell crosstalk between epithelial progenitors and other supporting cell types in
the lung. We can now model the formation of airway- and alveolar-like structures from lung progenitor cells,
and we have a platform to understand differentiation control at the molecular level. This research program
seeks to build on our advances and to further develop lung organoids to interrogate the molecular
underpinnings of cell-cell interactions between epithelial progenitor cells and their environment in the adult lung
homeostasis and in diseased lung. We will determine the signals through which epithelial progenitors are
regulated by mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells during lung injury response and repair. Cells from
mouse models of lung disease will be used for single cell RNA-sequencing and in organoid systems to identify
cell autonomous and paracrine mechanisms that can be used for therapeutic intervention. We will refine our
techniques for use with human lung cells. We will create a lung progenitor cell transplantation assay, a critical
need in the lung community for the study of progenitors and for regenerative medicine. While other groups are
focused on cataloging lung cell types, our strategies will provide essential tools to interrogate the biological
functions of diverse lung cells. Collectively, these new approaches will allow us to continue to build and utilize
transformative methods to probe numerous aspects of the biology of normal lung and lung disease."
10775818,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over our lifetime, we learn hundreds of ‘rules’ that define how we should act in a given situation. For example,
when in a restaurant, we follow a set of rules that guide the way we order, eat, and pay for a meal. By learning
and using rules, we can optimize our behavior and maximize social and physical rewards. Disrupting one’s ability
to learn and follow rules can be pathological. Such disruptions are associated with many neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and dementia, where they carry high social and economic
costs. To develop novel, mechanistically-informed, treatments for these diseases, we must first develop a
detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms that support rules.
Here, we aim to understand how the brain flexibly learns, follows, and switches between several different rules.
Combining large-scale, multi-region electrophysiology with novel behavioral paradigms in monkeys, we will study
two aspects of flexible rule-based behavior:
First, one must be able to discover which rule to follow in a new situation. This requires integrating information
from the world to decide which rule, from a set of known rules, is the correct one for the situation. Our first aim
will leverage our large-scale recording techniques to distinguish hypotheses about the relative role of prefrontal
cortex, parietal cortex, and basal ganglia in integrating feedback and deciding which rule to follow.
Second, we aim to understand how multiple rules are learned, represented, and executed. Specifically, we will
test hypotheses that the representation of rules is structured: computationally similar rules use similar neural
mechanisms. Such structure is theorized to allow us to rapidly learn new rules in new situations. To this end,
monkeys will learn and perform multiple, computationally-related, rules. In our second aim, we will use a
combination of chronic and acute electrophysiology to track the neural representation of a rule through
learning. This will distinguish hypotheses about how the neural representation of a rule is structured, and how it
relates to other, similar, rules. In parallel, our third aim will use the same recordings to understand how rules
act on stimulus representations to transform them into rule-appropriate responses. We will test three theories
of cognitive control, including a novel dynamic model that hypothesizes rules act by dynamically transforming
neural representations between subspaces of neural activity.
While our proposed research is basic in nature, we believe it is an important first step in a mechanistic
understanding of the core cognitive deficits of several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia. We believe
this understanding will improve mental health by leading to new diagnostics and treatments for cognitive
disorders. In particular, we hope to use our results to develop physiological markers that will improve detection,
allow for earlier intervention, and guide targeted treatments."

 Our goal is to advance CMS121 to a Phase 2 clinical trial by conducting the long-term non-clinical toxicology
studies needed to support a long-term course of daily administration to subjects with mild to moderate
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). CMS121 is a small molecule that has shown efficacy in multiple mouse models of
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and offers a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of AD in humans.
 While the recently approved drugs for AD reduce Aβ plaque load, their effects on the key clinical hallmarks
of the disease, such as impaired memory and loss of executive function, are not yet clear. Thus, there is a
continued need for additional AD drug candidates, especially ones that address these debilitating features of
AD. We believe that an effective AD drug will have to demonstrate powerful effects against multiple pathological
processes. A truly disease-modifying drug with long-term therapeutic benefits and immediate cognitive benefits
would be a tremendous benefit to the millions affected by AD. CMS121 was derived using a novel approach to
AD drug development and interacts with targets distinct from those of other AD drugs and drug candidates,
thereby providing an altogether new approach to disease treatment.
 CMS121 was developed in conjunction with Salk Institute scientists. The parent compound, identified from a
broad screen of compounds for neuroprotective activity, was modified to obtain a series of derivatives with vastly
superior protective and pharmacologic characteristics. The derivative, CMS121, prevents and reverses a number
of the behavioral symptoms associated with AD in both genetic and sporadic mouse models of AD.
 Studies of the mechanism of action show that CMS121 affects multiple, specific regulators of lipid synthesis
and metabolism, resulting in a reduction in fatty acid synthesis and lipid peroxidation and an enhancement of
mitochondrial homeostasis. All of these features are altered in AD brains and these alterations are associated
with neuroinflammation. Furthermore, a restoration of these alterations to normal levels has been shown to be
beneficial in multiple models of AD.
 A Phase 1 clinical trial of CMS121 is now wrapping up as the last dosing was concluded a few weeks ago
(December, 2022). The completion of data compilation is in progress. The next step in the evaluation of CMS121
as a therapeutic for AD is a Phase 2 trial, in which subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/early AD will
be dosed for longer durations of daily administration to assess clinical benefits. A longer term treatment is very
likely necessary to see improvement in cognition and other parameters for a disease that is characterized by a
slow progression, particularly at the early stages. Before proceeding to the longer duration Phase 2 trials, a long-
term toxicology study in animals is required by the FDA to provide critical safety information. The studies
proposed in this application are a 6-month rat and a 9-month dog toxicology study, in which dosing will be
administered daily over those periods. The results will guide the dosing and testing design of the Phase 2 human
trial."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to the abnormalities of patients' movement
and other functions. The current clinical diagnosis of PD cannot accomplish the desired accuracy. Imaging
biomarkers of PD has shown great promising in improving the diagnosis accuracy. Our co-investigators
developed a high spatial resolution diffusion MRI, which can improve the spatial resolution substantially and
diminish geometric distortion. Pioneer studies conducted by our co-investigators identified changes in left side
of substantia nigra of right-handed patients with PD. However, the potential of the data has not been fully
realized due to the lack of appropriate statistical methods for this new type of data. This proposal aims to
develop new statistical and computational tools to identify imaging biomarkers via parameters in the continuous
time random walk (CTRW) model using the high resolution MRI data. Existing statistical methods for the CTRW
model did not take the advantage of the high resolution data. The proposed statistical methods will perform high
dimensional inference to integrate the information from a large number of pixels in the MRI data to achieve the
power that cannot be attained by conventional low dimensional methods. This proposal has two specific
objectives (1 ): develop high dimensional statistical inference methods for the CTRW model using high spatial
resolution diffusion MRI; (2): integrate patients' clinical characteristics, such as disease duration, and
neurological test scores and relevant biological variables such as age and sex, with imaging biomarkers in
improving the diagnosis accuracy for PD. The developed statistics methods will be applied to diffusion MRI data
sets of PD patients collected by co-investigators and their collaborators. User friendly software and
computational tools will be made available for public use."

Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a severe, potentially life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver
disease (ALD) with limited therapeutic options. Cholestasis and biliary dysfunction are common in AH
patients and can worsen AH prognosis. The central hypothesis is that alcohol consumption reshapes the
hepatic microenvironment and predisposes biliary epithelial cells (BECs) to additional injury, causing
cholestatic liver injury and contributing to the progression of ALD. The overall objectives for this K01
proposal are to leverage a novel mouse model presenting alcohol-associated cholestasis and hepatitis
(AlChoHep) to 1) determine the mechanism by which alcohol consumption predisposes livers to
cholestatic liver injury, and 2) elucidate the role of cholestasis in the development of AH. The overall
objectives of this application will be attained by pursuing two specific aims: (1) determine the mechanism
of cholestasis in ALD and (2) elucidate the role of cholestasis in AH. Under the first aim, the working
hypothesis will be determined by fecal microbiome transplant, bile acid depletion, liver organoid cultures,
RNA sequencing, and ATAC-seq. Alteration of gut-modified bile acids and gut microbiome will be
analyzed. The role of HMGB1 will be studied in liver-specific Hmgb1-knockout mice. The working
hypothesis of the second aim will be tested by scFFPE-seq, spatial transcriptomics, metabolomics,
leukotriene pathway inhibition, and liver organoid cultures. Upon successful completion of the proposed
research, the expectation is to have defined the roles of the gut-liver axis and hepatocellular HMGB1 in
the development of alcohol-associated cholestasis (Aim 1), and to have elucidated the impact of
cholestasis on the liver microenvironment and how this contributes to the pathogenesis of AH (Aim 2).
This K01 application will promote the development of the applicant into a multidisciplinarily trained
independent principal investigator. The applicant has assembled a Mentoring Committee composed of
outstanding scientists, including three mentors (Drs. Xiao-Ming Yin, Wenke Feng, and Xiaojiang Xu) and
two key collaborators (Drs. Jay Kolls and Suthat Liangpunsakul), who are renowned hepatologists or
well-recognized scientists in the field of ALD, gut-liver axis, inflammation, and bioinformatics, with an
outstanding record of training junior scientists to be independent and successful in academia. They will
direct the applicant’s career development and provide full support to the implementation of the proposed
experiments. Upon completion of the studies, the applicant will receive additional training from the
Mentoring Committee to gain expertise in several areas, including gut-liver axis, the pathophysiology of
AH, liver inflammation, and bioinformatics. The successful completion of the proposed project will yield
significant data for a follow-on R01 level application."

Precisely mapping the structure of synaptic connectivity offers a pathway to understanding the function of
neural circuits and how they go awry in neurological disease. Holographic optogenetics has recently emerged
as a revolutionary technology capable of optically probing the synaptic structure and function of neural circuits
through the stimulation of neurons with near single-cell precision. However, despite its success, this technology
is currently greatly underutilized due to a lack of computational methods capable of modeling these complex
experiments and interpreting the data they generate. Thus, there is a need for new computational methods to
maximize the scientific impact of holographic optogenetics in neuroscience research.
In recent work, I have created a machine learning algorithm for inferring monosynaptic connectivity from
holographic stimulation of specifically targeted populations of neurons. This algorithm increased the rate of in
vitro monosynaptic connectivity mapping by more than an order of magnitude over existing approaches using
optogenetic stimulation, demonstrating the transformative effect that computational methods can have in this
scientific domain. Building on this advance, I now propose to develop a set of computational methods enabling
holographic control and mapping of neural circuits in vivo and at unprecedented detail, scale, and precision.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will develop a real-time target optimization algorithm to select holographic
stimulation parameters that eliminate the unintended activation of non-target neurons when attempting to
probe the connectivity or function of neural circuits (K99). In Aim 2, I will extend my earlier connectivity
mapping inference approach by using calcium imaging to discriminate the presynaptic origin of postsynaptic
responses at extremely fine detail (K99/R00). Finally, in Aim 3, I will develop a computational approach that
leverages voltage imaging to all-optically map tens of thousands of potential recurrent connections between
hundreds of neurons (R00). Together, these aims provide practical tools enabling high-throughput collection of
large-scale maps of synaptic connectivity within individual experiments. Using these tools to probe the
structure and function of neural circuits could ultimately shed light on the etiology of neurological diseases.
During the K99 phase, this work will be conducted at the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia
University, where I will receive scientific training in computational neuroscience under Dr. Liam Paninski, a
leading authority in computational methods for neural data. Additionally, I will receive training in experimental
neuroscience from Drs. Hillel Adesnik and Adam Cohen, who are experts in holographic optogenetics and
voltage imaging. Their combined scientific expertise and impressive track record of transitioning postdoctoral
scientists to faculty positions make them the ideal mentorship team for my goal of becoming an independent
group leader working on computational methods for the optical interrogation of neural circuits."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of cancer because they yield dramatic
responses and long-lasting therapeutic benefits in previously untreatable cancers (e.g. metastatic melanoma).
Despite this promise, the responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have been restricted to small subsets of
patients and are associated with toxic, and potentially fatal immune-related adverse events. In response to this
urgent need to devise novel therapeutic strategies that dramatically increase the response rate to immune
checkpoint inhibitors, we have engineered an ensemble nanoimmunotherapy that combine the advantages of
nanotechnology and immunotherapy. Specifically, our ensemble comprises: Prussian blue nanoparticles
(PBNPs) biofunctionalized with immune adjuvants and administered in combination with systemically
administered checkpoint inhibitors. We utilize the PBNPs for photothermal therapy, which ablates tumor cells,
releasing tumor antigens, and damage-associated molecular patterns that increase tumor immunogenicity. The
loss of immunogenicity is one of the key immune escape mechanisms in cancer. Additionally, the PBNPs are
biofunctionalized to serve as a depot for local delivery of exogenous immune adjuvants, particularly toll-like
receptor agonists that play an important role in breaking tolerance to tumor antigens and improving tumor
antigen presentation, which is impaired in immunosuppressive tumors. These effects are complemented by
systemically administered checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) that reverse suppression of
immune cell responses (particularly T cells) and unleash their potent antitumor effects. We believe that this
ensemble approach of targeting tumor cells, antigen presenting cells, and T cells may hold the key in
converting a non-responsive “cold” tumor to a responsive “hot” tumor. In Aim 1, we seek to determine whether
the PBNPs biofunctionalized with toll-like receptor agonists and used for photothermal therapy elicits
immunogenic cell death and improves antigen presentation. In Aim 2, we test the efficacy of the ensemble
nanoimmunotherapy on tumor eradication and preventing relapse. In Aim 3, we evaluate the efficacy of the
nanoimmunotherapy in treating disseminated cancer. The successful completion of the project will provide
critical insight into the use of multifunctional nanoparticles in combination with immunotherapies to overcome
tumor immune evasion mechanisms and improve therapeutic outcomes. Importantly, it will provide the impetus
for clinical translation of our nanoimmunotherapy, thereby extending its lasting benefits to a larger proportion of
cancer patients."
10758518,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a hereditary metabolic disorder that manifests with inflammatory degeneration
of the brain and progressive spinal cord atrophy. ALD is characterized by an accumulation of very long chain
fatty acids (VLCFA) that are usually restricted to small amounts in healthy tissue. The buildup of VLCFAs
contributes to the development of oxidative stress injury, disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis, and other
stressors that culminate in the loss of brain myelin, the fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers, and robust
neuroinflammation that altogether precipitate the deterioration of the major fiber tracts within the central nervous
system (CNS). Despite early detection via newborn screening, only a small fraction of patients enjoys a
therapeutic option in bone marrow transplantation, which is the sole approved therapy for ALD. For the majority
of patients, however, bone marrow transplantation is ineffective, particularly for the spinal cord atrophy
phenotype which has near complete penetrance. Approaches to broaden therapeutic options are critical then,
and especially relevant is the discovery of molecular targets and pathways that can help reverse the disease
processes. We found that one candidate target is the nuclear receptor called peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor beta/delta (Pparβ/δ), which serves as a regulator for various lipid metabolic pathways in the brain cell-
type that produces myelin and is critical for myelin maintenance. We have observed that genes regulated by
Pparβ/δ encode key components necessary for VLCFA metabolism, which when upregulated can compensate
for the VLCFA oxidation defect observed in ALD. In this proposal, we will work to elucidate the role of Pparβ/δ
in the context of ALD, with the aims of determining the mechanism by which Pparβ/δ can mitigate the
accumulation of VLCFAs in disease relevant tissues. Additionally, this project will reveal novel molecular
pathways underlying the pathomechanism of ALD, which will amplify pursuable therapeutic targets, as well as
decipher how disruptions in the immune compartment can aggravate disease progression. To accomplish these
aims, the project will employ genetically engineered mice and various primary cell culture systems as model
systems for ALD, along with an assortment of well-established methods and rigorously designed experimental
approaches. In sum, this comprehensive study will help delineate a targetable molecular pathway with
therapeutic potential for ALD, as well as describe additional molecular pathways pertinent to disease onset and
progression. Additionally, this project will also provide the PI with a substantial training and learning experience
to facilitate the development into a skilled and innovative physician scientist."

 To interpret the vocalizations used in communication, such as human speech, animals
and humans must perform a range of auditory tasks: the detection and localization of sounds,
the perception of pitch and timbre, and the parsing and categorization of the information bearing
sound features that is required for the interpretation of communication calls. Auditory
neuroscientists have obtained a relatively good model of how complex sounds are represented
in the primary auditory cortex primarily in terms of their spectro-temporal features. We also
know that a network of higher-level auditory and associative cortical areas is involved in
processing speech in humans and communication calls in animals. However, the neural circuits
and the corresponding non-linear transformations that occur between primary auditory cortical
areas and cortical regions that categorize communication sounds in terms of their meaning
remains unknown. We are developing the avian model system to bridge this gap. Songbirds
have a large repertoire of communication sounds that are used in distinct behavioral contexts.
By combining behavioral and neurophysiological experiments, we will investigate how calls are
categorized into call-types (semantics). We will also investigate the neural representation for
learned categories that correspond to different vocalizers (voice). Using state-of-the-art
computational approaches, we will decipher the sequence of non-linear processing steps
occurring both at the level of single neurons and neuronal ensembles that perform these sound-
to-meaning transformations. Our studies will elucidate the roles of different circuits within
auditory cortex for processing semantics and voice. This knowledge will be essential to
understand how dysfunctional auditory processing in certain mental disorders affects speech
recognition and consequently other cognitive skills. Our work could also be instrumental in the
development of novel signal processing methods for auditory neural prosthetics or hearing aids."

Cyberdontics is revolutionizing the dental industry by developing a novel intraoral scanner that will enable
affordable and efficient dental care. The market for dental services in the US is valued at $109 billion, but only
60% of Americans seek professional dental care. Of the patients that visit a dentist, they accept the ideal dental
treatment plan only 28% of the time. The main reasons cited for patients declining care are cost, the
inconvenience of multiple and lengthy dental appointments, patients believing they have good oral health when
they do not, and insurers not agreeing with the need for care. Avoiding the dentist for these reasons usually
results in dental disease progression, periodontal disease, and other oral problems, which impact patient
systemic health. Therefore, there is a critical need to reduce the cost of care, shorten visits, and help patients
and insurers understand the patient has a dental problem so they can accept care. Cyberdontics is adapting
optical coherence tomography (OCT), a fast, non-ionizing, and highly sensitive and specific approach, for dental
applications by creating an ultra-fast frame-capture-time 3D swept source (SS) OCT intraoral scanner that has
usability comparable to today’s intraoral surface scanners. This will replace current OCT techniques, which are
not adapted to the dental clinic as they slower, more involved, and less accurate. Cyberdontics is committed to
providing accessible and effective dental care.
In this Direct to Phase II proposal, Cyberdontics will develop their ultra-fast frame-capture-time 3D SS-OCT
scanner by increasing its performance and effectiveness. They will upgrade the laser, digitizer, and processing
pipeline, as well as evaluate and optimize various algorithms to improve the accuracy of the scan. Additionally,
they will conduct tests on human subjects to compare the performance of their scanner to traditional methods
and assess its effectiveness in guiding the placement of subgingival crowns. Upon completion of this work,
Cyberdontics will be well-positioned to pursue commercialization of their innovative imaging solution."
10768775,"Project Summary: Protein misfolding is implicated in many diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease. Understanding protein folding mechanisms is therefore important for
human health. While protein folding has been extensively studied for many years, the real-time folding of a
protein has yet to be captured and quantified in a living cell due to a lack of adequate experimental spatiotemporal
resolution. To fill the gap, I will combine single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and novel intrabodies that can
distinguish unfolded and folded proteins to image cotranslational protein folding dynamics in living cells. With
this technology, I propose to investigate the folding dynamics of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR), the misfolding of which causes cystic fibrosis. CFTR is a good first application because it has
already been demonstrated to predominantly fold cotranslationally in vitro. To characterize CFTR folding in living
cells, I will develop genetically encodable intrabodies that bind folded and unfolded CFTR cytosolic domains
(Aim 1). In parallel, I will establish methods to capture and quantify cotranslational protein folding dynamics using
a model protein folding system based on GFP and its pre-existing intrabodies (Aim 2). With the technology from
Aims 1 and 2 in hand (K99 phase), I will image CFTR cotranslational folding dynamics at the single mRNA level
in living cells (Aim 3; R00 phase). This will reveal precisely when, where, and to what degree cotranslational
CFTR folding is regulated within a fully natural context. Collectively, this work will not only shed new light on
cotranslational protein folding dynamics, but will also lead to new strategies to combat cystic fibrosis and other
protein misfolding diseases."

Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration contributes to ~40% of back pain cases. Structural IVD defects
distinguish degeneration from aging and play a role pain and disability. There is a critical unmet need for
improved annulus fibrosus (AF) repair strategies since discectomy, the gold standard treatment for removing
herniated nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue from AF defects, leaves AF defects unrepaired and complications
include reherniation and recurrent degeneration-related pain. While clinical trials of IVD cell therapy show
promise to reduce discogenic pain and disability they do not involve optimized delivery strategies, and are not
informed by natural IVD healing processes since remarkably little is known about the diversity of AF cell
populations and their roles in healing. We believe an IVD regenerative healing model is required to identify
successful AF healing strategies and to identify cellular and micromechanical factors critical in successful
healing to serve as a roadmap for regenerative medicine treatments. We've developed a successful
regenerative AF healing model in mice and show neonatal IVDs with severe AF puncture heal with complete
restoration of IVD height and biomechanical properties while adults heal fibrotic deposition and loss of IVD
height and biomechanical function. The premise of this project is that neonates regeneratively heal while
skeletally mature mice do not due to increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and altered ligand
presentation resulting in terminal differentiation of AF progenitors. Aim 1 determines effects of growth,
maturation, and matrix stiffness on IVD healing and determines when the regenerative window closes. We
apply mouse models to determines the postnatal age that the AF regenerative healing window closes, if
complete AF structural regeneration is possible, and if altering ECM stiffness can extend the regenerative
healing window and prolong the age when AF cells are in mitosis. Aim 2 identifies distinct AF progenitor
populations, their loss with maturation, and roles of these progenitors in healing. We use single cell and spatial
sequencing in mouse IVDs to identify distinct AF cell populations and their localization in mice of regenerative

substrate that promotes immature AF cell phenotypes. We identify design criteria in mouse and human ECM

11009729,"Summary
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration contributes to ~40% of back pain cases. Structural IVD defects
distinguish degeneration from aging and play a role pain and disability. There is a critical unmet need for
improved annulus fibrosus (AF) repair strategies since discectomy, the gold standard treatment for removing
herniated nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue from AF defects, leaves AF defects unrepaired and complications
include reherniation and recurrent degeneration-related pain. While clinical trials of IVD cell therapy show
promise to reduce discogenic pain and disability they do not involve optimized delivery strategies, and are not
informed by natural IVD healing processes since remarkably little is known about the diversity of AF cell
populations and their roles in healing. We believe an IVD regenerative healing model is required to identify
successful AF healing strategies and to identify cellular and micromechanical factors critical in successful
healing to serve as a roadmap for regenerative medicine treatments. We've developed a successful
regenerative AF healing model in mice and show neonatal IVDs with severe AF puncture heal with complete
restoration of IVD height and biomechanical properties while adults heal fibrotic deposition and loss of IVD
height and biomechanical function. The premise of this project is that neonates regeneratively heal while
skeletally mature mice do not due to increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and altered ligand
presentation resulting in terminal differentiation of AF progenitors. Aim 1 determines effects of growth,
maturation, and matrix stiffness on IVD healing and determines when the regenerative window closes. We
apply mouse models to determines the postnatal age that the AF regenerative healing window closes, if
complete AF structural regeneration is possible, and if altering ECM stiffness can extend the regenerative
healing window and prolong the age when AF cells are in mitosis. Aim 2 identifies distinct AF progenitor
populations, their loss with maturation, and roles of these progenitors in healing. We use single cell and spatial
sequencing in mouse IVDs to identify distinct AF cell populations and their localization in mice of regenerative
healing, post-regenerative healing, and regenerative restoration groups. Aim 3 engineers a soft-synthetic
substrate that promotes immature AF cell phenotypes. We identify design criteria in mouse and human ECM
and cells and control substrate stiffness, ligand type, and density using functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)
substrates. Outcomes of this project include determining when the IVD regenerative repair window closes and
if full regeneration is possible; identifying disperse AF progenitor populations and their roles in regenerative
healing; and determining critical design factors that promote immature AF progenitor phenotypes and inform

10932244,"ABSTRACT – TISSUE MODELING & DRUG DEVELOPMENT CORE (SHARED RESOURCE)
The goal of the Florida-California Cancer Research, Education, & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center’s
Tissue Modeling and Drug Development Core (TMDDC) is to provide a growing archive of fixed and living tissues
that will support the mission of the CaRE2 Center. In the first funding period (Cycle 1), we were highly successful
in gaining access for FAMU and CaRE2 researchers to annotated tissues from Black/African American (B/AA)
and Hispanic/Latinx (H/L). In total, the TMDDC now has regulatory compliant access across the partnership to
cancer cases including pancreatic cancer blocks (295 B/AA, 306 H/L), pancreatic cancer plasma/serum (136
B/AA, 53 H/L), prostate cancer blocks (548 B/AA, 195 H/L), and prostate plasma/serum (595 B/AA, 92 H/L).
Also, the TMDDC facilitated creation or identification of 4 new patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from B/AA
patients with pancreatic cancer for studies at FAMU and USC. The TMDDC will continue to develop a robust,
well-annotated biorepository of fixed and living tissue samples from a racially and ethnically diverse Florida and
California patient population and make them available to the CaRE2 investigators. The TMDDC will consist of
existing institutional, nationally shared, and future-conscious biorepository resources. The short-term goals of
the TMDDC are to provide the necessary tissue samples for the three projects included in this application, while
preparing for the future needs of the existing and upcoming CaRE2 Center projects. The TMC will address the
challenge of recruiting B/AA and H/L individuals in medical research and the limited supply of quality
biospecimens and genomic data for these populations. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1. Advance our existing
virtual and physical repositories that will increasingly provide biospecimens from diverse tumor repositories
through a single access point provided by the CaRE2 Center. Many cancer types and many tissue models are
relevant to outcomes in disparities research. The broad types of tissues and data required to study these complex
issues make acquisition of a fully satisfactory repository beyond the scope of any single institution. Therefore,
we will develop capabilities to collect or acquire novel diverse and well annotated specimens through our
institutional resources and other resources. Aim 2. Acquire living tumor tissue for drug development. PDXs
have proven to better predict human drug responses than historically used cell-line derived studies. Development
of these PDXs has the potential to facilitate rapid drug development, including testing response as a function of
race/ancestry. The TMDDC will advance the existing Cycle 1 developed tissue repository at FAMU. The TMDDC
will advance on the existing living tissue repository at FAMU. By achieving these aims, we will: (1) enhance
cancer disparities tissue-modeling research; (2) expand cancer disparities resources for CaRE2 researchers,
and (3) ensure a sustained focus on transferring know-how, technology, and collaborations with FAMU.
Evaluation will be based on adequate provision of project-required specimens/resources and by success in
transferring drug development technology and knowhow to FAMU."
10765633,"ABSTRACT
While B-cells are under intense selective pressure to eliminate autoreactive and pre-malignant clones,
we identified SYK as central kinase to set the thresholds for negative selection. SYK and its highly
homologous relative ZAP70 initiate B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling in B- and
T-lymphocytes, respectively. Even though the two kinases are almost identical and serve analogous
functions, their expression in B- and T-cells is strictly segregated throughout evolution. Whereas the
reason for separation of the two kinases is not known, aberrant coexpression of Syk and Zap70 was
previously reported in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and in peripheral T-cell lymphoma
(PTCL). Our group recently demonstrated that aberrant ZAP70 expression is a common feature in pre-
germinal center (GC) B-cell malignancies (B-ALL, CLL, MCL; Sadras et al., Mol Cell 2021). In genetic
mouse models for B-ALL and B-CLL, inducible coexpression of Zap70 accelerated disease onset, while
genetic deletion impaired malignant transformation. Likewise, inducible expression of Zap70 during
early B-cell development subverted negative selection of autoreactive B-cells to promote pervasive
autoantibody production.
Mechanistically, ZAP70 competes with SYK and exerts a dominant-negative effect on SYK-dependent
Ca2+-signaling. By occupying but not phosphorylating BLNK, BTK and PLC2 substrates upstream of
calcium signaling, ZAP70 dramatically reduces the frequency of autonomous Ca2+-oscillations. Fast
oscillations in the sole presence of SYK (4.5 mHz) are decoded by NFATC1 and result in anergy and
cell death. In contrast, slow Ca2+-oscillations in the presence of ZAP70 (0.25 mHz) promote selective
activation of NF-B and B-cell survival and proliferation.
We test here the central hypothesis that B-cells sense pathological signaling downstream of an
autoreactive BCR or a transforming oncogene through SYK-dependent high-frequency Ca2+-
oscillations. At high frequencies, Ca2+-oscillations activate NFATC1 to initiate B-cell anergy and clonal
deletion. Conversely, ZAP70 slows down Ca2+-oscillations to activate NF-B instead of NFATC1 and
enables autoreactive and premalignant B-cell clones to persist and eventually give rise to autoimmune
disease or pre-GC B-cell malignancies.
We are proposing three Aims to (1) elucidate the mechanisms by which ZAP70 slows down SYK-
dependent high-frequency Ca2+-oscillations, to (2) determine how coexpression of ZAP70 subverts
negative selection of autoreactive B-cells in autoimmune disease and (3) to uncover how ZAP70
enables oncogenic signaling and overt malignant transformation of pre-malignant B-cells."

 The proposed research focuses on processes that are mediated by proteins, that are crucial for
cellular physiology and that are dysregulated in human disease. This effort has two components that differ
topically but share common themes in experimental design. Fundamental mechanistic insight is our
primary goal, but outcomes could support future therapeutic advances. We use chemically synthesized
polypeptides to test molecular hypotheses, an approach that transcends the compositional limitations of
biosynthetic polypeptides.
 One major focus involves signal transduction by a set of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that
are naturally modulated by long polypeptide hormones (B family GPCRs). Agents that activate these
receptors are used in human medicine. We conduct parallel studies with multiple receptors so that we can
discern which features of the signal transduction process are conserved and which features are unique to
specific receptors. We have previously explored the parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTHR1) and the
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), agonists of which are used to treat osteoporosis or type 2
diabetes, respectively. Continuing work on these two receptors will be complemented by new studies with
the glucagon receptor (GCGR; glucagon is used by diabetes patients to reverse hypoglycemic shock) and
the GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R; agonists are used to treat short-bowel syndrome).
 Proposed studies will harness unique capabilities of our group to explore the consequences of
varying agonist conformational propensities in terms of signaling outcomes and receptor binding. Results
should be very impactful because agonist design efforts motivated by therapeutic goals usually focus on
stabilizing a specific receptor-bound conformation of the agonist, which is fully α-helical for the GPCR
agonists we study. Our recent findings raise questions about this approach; we have discovered
surprisingly potent agonists based on designs that destabilize the α-helical conformation.
 The other major research focus is liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediated by proteins. LLPS
in cells leads to a variety of “membraneless organelles” (MOs) that appear to be crucial for cellular
function. The noncovalent interactions that underlie these dynamic assemblies are not well understood.
Evolution of dynamic MOs toward more ordered assemblies appears to underlie some neurodegenerative
diseases. Our approach involves developing models of protein-mediated LLPS in which one component is
a peptide of < 50 residues and therefore readily accessible via chemical synthesis; the other component is
a larger biopolymer (protein or RNA). This design strategy enables incisive evaluation of the roles of
diverse noncovalent interactions in the dynamic associations that are unique to MOs. Results should
inform future efforts to address diseases associated with “hardening” of MOs within cells."

The four serotypes of dengue virus pose a significant and increasing disease risk to endemic areas (40% of the
world) and (via mosquito vector spread or travel) to areas not yet endemic. Tetravalent dengue vaccines are
critical to prevent dengue illness. They must generate concurrent and durable protection against all serotypes
without increasing risk of severe disease via imbalanced immunity leading to antibody-dependent enhancement
of infection. Given concerns with imbalanced dengue vaccine candidates, it is critical to define components and
mechanisms of durable four-serotype protection following vaccination, particularly in people (especially children)
who have not established protective immunity via sequential natural exposures. This proposal builds on the work
of long-standing collaborative investigators involved in developing the NIH live-attenuated tetravalent dengue
vaccine TetraVax (TV) in studies in the U.S. and in dengue-endemic Bangladesh. TV protected dengue-naïve
individuals from experimental infection six months later with dengue virus serotype 2 challenge and induced
robust dengue serotype-specific B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Key questions include: the
durability of protective responses, whether similar protective mechanisms are at play in individuals in dengue-
endemic areas and in individuals previously exposed to dengue prior to vaccination. In Aim 1 we will evaluate
the development of serotype-specific B cells producing antibodies with neutralizing and Fc effector functions as
well as virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses throughout a 6–12-year period after TV vaccination and
assess whether these responses correlate with protection from subsequent DENV2 challenge. In Aim 2 we will
demonstrate the importance, persistence, and function of serotype-specific neutralizing vs. enhancing antibodies
following TV of dengue-naïve adults. In Aim 3 we will investigate whether TV vaccination contributes to protection
in dengue-exposed individuals via potent cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. Overall, these insights into
immune mechanisms of durable protection will help answer persistent questions about dengue vaccine risk and
efficacy. Leveraged with highly controlled clinical studies these data should be broadly generalizable to the
understanding of safe and durable immunity following any tetravalent dengue vaccine."
10897765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-typhoidal Salmonella are successful foodborne pathogens in part because of their ability to utilize diverse
nutrient sources to support disease in many hosts. Within the mammalian gut, catabolism of organosulfur
compounds by the host and/or the microbiota can lead to production of the electron acceptor dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). The genome of Escherichia coli K12, a closely related gut-commensal bacterium, encodes a single co-
transcribed operon dedicated to the anaerobic reduction of DMSO (dmsABC) and has been used as a model
system to study DMSO respiration in Enterobacteriaceae. In contrast, Salmonella serotypes that cause enteric
disease encode three operons homologous to dmsABC, suggesting this pathway is important to support fitness
within the gut. Our prior work demonstrates that DMSO reduction is a biologically relevant pathway to support
Salmonella fitness during acute intestinal colonization. In vitro phenotyping suggests STM0964 is the dominant
homolog of dmsA, the catalytic subunit of a DMSO reductase, while STM4305 acts an alternate dmsA homolog
during anaerobic growth. However, there is a critical gap in our understanding of how the bacterium regulates
the use of each DMSO reductase and how each DMSO reductase contributes to fitness during enteric infection.
Genetic redundancy in anaerobic respiration pathways is a common theme in Enterobacteriaceae that allows
bacteria to benefit from changes in nutrient availability to regulate fitness in the gut. My preliminary data shows
that DMSO increases the promoter activity of the alternate dmsA homolog, STM4305. The promoter activity of
the dominant dmsA homolog, STM0964, is not activated by DMSO akin to E. coli dmsA, suggesting that
Salmonella possesses a novel mechanism for transcriptional regulation by DMSO. I hypothesize that
differential activation of DMSO reductases supports Salmonella fitness within the gut. In Aim I, I will
establish a mechanism for DMSO-mediated transcriptional regulation of the alternate DMSO reductase using
biochemical, genetic and RNA sequencing approaches. In Aim II, I will utilize fluorescence microscopy and
competitive infections to elucidate the contribution of each DMSO reductase during enteric infection of the bovine
host. The proposed work will integrate my veterinary training with large animal modeling of enteric disease and
advanced gene expression analysis to establish how Salmonella benefits from apparent genetic redundancy in
DMSO reduction. At the completion of fellowship training, I will be poised for success in a career as an
independent clinician-scientist with expertise in genetic approaches and animal modeling to study infectious
diseases of One Health significance."
10886538,"Project Summary/Abstract
Opioid use has increased drastically among all demographics in the United States, including in pregnant
women. This rise opioid use during pregnancy leads to health concerns for infants, who may develop acute
opioid withdrawal symptoms shortly after birth, resulting in a diagnosis of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal
Syndrome (NOWS). There is no standard of treatment for NOWS, though some hospitals choose to treat using
morphine tapering or buprenorphine. Despite increasing rates of diagnoses, the long-term effects of NOWS on
cellular function, physiological development, and behavior have yet to be fully characterized. Opioids are
modulators of the immune system and exert pro-inflammatory effects within the central nervous system by
binding to microglia. Clinical data has shown potential immune dysfunction in infants diagnosed with NOWS,
but these studies are limited, and results have not yet been fully examined in preclinical models. Using a novel
mouse model of NOWS (“the three-trimester model”), we have found evidence of increased microglia levels
induced by perinatal opioid exposure immediately after withdrawal. The full extent of this neuroimmune
dysfunction, as well as the long-term changes, have yet to be studied. The goal of this proposal is to fully
characterize the acute and persisting neuroimmune changes induced by early life opioid exposure and
withdrawal, and to evaluate microglia as a potential therapeutic target in mitigating withdrawal symptoms. Aim
1 will investigate acute changes in microglia and cytokines immediately following opioid withdrawal at postnatal
day 15. Aim 2 will measure persisting neuroimmune alterations in adulthood, both at baseline and in response
to an immune challenge, by examining molecular changes and sickness response behavior. Aim 3 will
pharmacologically suppress microglial activation and assess for improvements in withdrawal symptoms.
Successful completion of these aims will fully characterize neuroimmune changes induced by perinatal opioid
exposure and withdrawal and provide evidence for a novel therapeutic target in treating NOWS. Through this
fellowship, Ms. Ferrante will accomplish defined Training Goals, including technical proficiency in molecular
laboratory techniques, expertise in the field of neuroimmunology, refined written and oral scientific
communication, and professional development towards a career in academic research. This fellowship will also
facilitate progress towards achieving her current and future research goals in order to enable success as an
independent researcher."
10913579,"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) experience a high symptomatic burden, heart failure and
lethal arrhythmias. While HCM has been recognized as a disease of the sarcomere for >30 years, the disease
mechanisms for sarcomeric gene variants are not well defined, limiting the precision and efficacy of treatment
options. Heterozygous variants in the gene myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) cause half of all cases of
familial HCM. About 15% of these are missense variants that cluster in interior protein domains C3 and C6
which have uncertain binding partners or function. Computational predictions combined with our
published and preliminary experimental data support the hypothesis that missense variants in C3 and
C6 domains lead to perturbation of multiple protein-protein interactions that are critical for the normal
function of MyBP-C (the protein encoded by MYBPC3). In Aim 1 we will apply TurboID proximity labeling to
wild-type (WT) and mutant MyBP-C. In preliminary data we have identified >200 novel and unique neighboring
proteins to WT MyBP-C. Comparing C3 and C6 mutants to wild-type MyBP-C, relative abundances of
sarcomeric, cytoskeletal and ribonucleoprotein complexes are reduced, while abundances of ribosomal and
chaperone proteins are increased. We will explore consequences of these altered interactions by assessing
changes in myosin conformation, local translation, and chaperone-mediate protein turnover. We expect to find
that interactions with multiple proteins of diverse function are either strengthened or weakened by the presence
of missense mutations in MyBP-C. Overcoming this perturbation in protein interactions with gene replacement
by wild-type MyBP-C is the focus of Aim 2 where we will test the hypothesis that the mutant protein can be
stoichiometrically replaced within the sarcomere by wild-type MyBP-C. We will transduce patient-derived
inducible-pluripotent cardiomyocytes expressing C3 or C6 missense variants with adeno-associated viral
vectors expressing wild-type MyBP-C or a lentiviral vector expressing a “titratable” wild-type MyBP-C-FKBP12
fusion protein that enables dose-response studies. The outcome measures will be the molar ratio of mutant to
wild-type protein, and contractile and relaxation velocities. In vivo studies of gene replacement in a new
Arg506Trp MYBPC3 knock-in mouse model will complement the hiPSC-CM experiments. This application
explores several novel aspects of MyBP-C biology and features unique reagents and advanced proteomic
techniques. Successful completion of these aims will uncover new biology in MyBP-C by defining an expanded
protein neighborhood, by revealing disease mechanisms for missense MYBPC3 variants, and by testing a
gene displacement strategy that leverages endogenous regulation of sarcomeric stoichiometry and could be
broadly applicable to missense variants in any sarcomere gene. Our investigative team, composed of a mix of
senior, highly experienced investigators and talented junior investigators with unique skill sets, is well poised to
achieve these goals."
10766797,"The biomedical research community is underrepresented in populations of certain ethnic origin, with
disability and of disadvantage background, in part because research universities have failed to recruit and
graduate from biomedical doctoral degrees sufficient numbers of doctoral students from these populations
(UR). The UW PREP program seeks to increase the number of UR students in biomedical graduate programs
by (i) recruiting promising recently graduated UR students to the program; and (ii) providing them with
research experience, professional development and mentorship, leading to their successful enrollment and
graduation in first rated pre-doctoral programs. In the first two funding cycles, PREP has recruited 53 fellows;
approximately 80% of them have reached graduate school in a premier biomedical research program; of these,
75% have graduated with PhD’s or are still in graduate school.
 The results of UW PREP demonstrate that its plan to develop the fellows, centered on a year-long
research experience patterned after graduate school, supplemented by a targeted set of professional
development activities, will allow applicants to be admitted to and then succeed in high-caliber biomedical pre-
doctoral programs. The foundation of this proposal and the reason for the success of UW PREP are the
enthusiasm of the trainees; the large group of highly accomplished and well-funded research laboratories at
the University of Washington (UW) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; and the support of pre-
doctoral and training programs that participate in UW PREP and with which PREP dovetails. From this very
large pool of investigators is drawn the core group of faculty mentors, Advisory and Executive committee
members listed in this application; all accomplished scientists closely associated with UW PREP and with a
demonstrated commitment to mentoring undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral URM fellows, including
previous UW PREP fellows.
 The objectives of this renewal of the UW PREP program remain as follows: (i) all fellows will apply for
admission into biomedical graduate programs; (ii) at least 75% of them will successfully enter first-rated pre-
doctoral graduate programs; (iii) at least 75% of them will graduate with a doctoral degree.
 UW PREP will match each fellow with a research laboratory mentor to conduct a year long,
hypothesis-driven research project. Co-mentoring by the program leadership will provide mentorship and
advising about graduate school application and choice and more. Professional development activities based on
each fellow’s individual development program (IDP) will increase scientific skills in writing, presentations, the
interpretation of the scientific literature and bioethics, and supplemental didactic training will fill gaps in
preparation. Self-confidence and scientific identity will be fostered through a variety of scientific and social
forums with URM groups in Seattle. Independent evaluation will measure the program’s impact, and guide the
implementation of any required programmatic change."
10766799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental health conditions negatively impact the quality of life of millions of individuals every year. Genomics
research has challenged long-held etiological boundaries among psychiatric, developmental, and neurological
diagnoses, collectively known as developmental brain disorders (DBD). Clinically distinct DBD, including autism
and schizophrenia (SCZ), share etiologies across a continuum of rare through common genomic variants that
confer varying impacts on brain function. Employing a genomics-first approach linked to electronic health record
(EHR) data, we will study the full continuum of DBD-related genomic variants and their combined effects on
phenotypic expression. A novel feature is our inclusion of a largely unexplored class of DBD-related copy number
variants (CNVs) of intermediate effect size (e.g., 15q11.2 BP1-2 deletions) that fall between the two extremes of
rare and common variation. We will leverage existing data from DiscovEHR, Geisinger’s large-scale genomics
initiative of >260,000 participants with exome sequence, SNP genotype, and longitudinal EHR data. We will
investigate how the interplay across the full continuum of genomic variants contributes to clinical DBD and
medical comorbidities through the following aims: 1) Evaluate the prevalence of DBD genomic variants of
large and intermediate effect size in a healthcare system-based population. Exome sequence data from
DiscovEHR participants will be analyzed to assess the prevalence of DBD variants of large and intermediate
effect size in genomic regions and genes known to be strong contributors to DBD risk. A subset of variant-
positive individuals will be phenotyped in Aims 2 and 3. 2) Conduct retrospective e-phenotyping, using
existing structured and unstructured EHR data, to investigate clinical variability and penetrance of DBD
variants. Building on Geisinger’s innovative EHR-based data extraction and PheWAS methodologies, we will
develop tiered, replicable strategies for highly accurate capture of DBD and medical phenotypes. These
phenotypes will be validated through systematic chart review of 1200 individuals with DBD variants. 3) Perform
prospective direct phenotyping using in-person and online assessments to compare quantitative traits
in individuals with DBD variants of large and intermediate effect size. Given the known limitations of using
EHR data to capture fine-grained cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, we will augment Aim 2 with in-person
assessments for variants of large and intermediate effect size (n=1250 total) and additional online surveys for
intermediate CNVs and controls (n=1000 each). 4) Evaluate the impact of PGS on clinical risk or resilience
for DBD in the presence of a DBD variant of large or intermediate effect size. We will model the added
impact of PGS on risk or resilience for DBD in individuals with variants of large and intermediate effect sizes.
These investigations may ultimately lead to individual-level DBD risk predictions, similar to genomic algorithms
in place for cancer and cardiovascular disease. Identification of individuals at highest risk for SCZ and other DBD
will drive earlier detection and even prevention, consistent with the goals of NIMH’s 2020 strategic plan."
10766803,"A large proportion of pregnant women worldwide (21% in our CDC-funded Generation C cohort, current
n=2,545) has been recently exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
and women of reproductive age continue to be infected despite widespread vaccination. However, the acute
and subacute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the vulnerable period of pregnancy and postpartum are
not yet clear. Pregnancy and the postpartum are high-risk periods for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and
for developing neuropsychiatric symptoms. Infections and dysregulation of inflammatory processes in the
periphery and central nervous system (CNS) are thought to play a role in this vulnerability. We now know that
SARS-CoV-2 causes high rates of subacute and long-term psychiatric and cognitive sequelae in the general

10767121,"Toxoplasma gondii is a proliﬁc eukaryotic parasite that is widely distributed throughout the world. Infection
with T. gondii can cause severe and potentially fatal brain and eye disease, especially in immunocompromised
individuals. Worldwide, T. gondii is also a leading infectious cause of blindness in otherwise healthy individuals.
The current ﬁrst-line therapy for T. gondii is a combination of the drugs pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, but
this regimen suffers from a number of shortcomings. These drugs must be taken for weeks to months,
frequently cause toxic side effects, and are incapable of eradicating chronic infection. We need new medicines
for T. gondii that are safer, better tolerated, more effective, and can be given for shorter durations.
 To this end, Dr. Alday and his colleagues have screened the 68,689 compounds in the Global Health
Chemical Diversity Library (GHCDL) to ﬁnd those that inhibit the growth of T. gondii. In doing so, 359 hit
compounds were found that strongly inhibit the growth of this parasite. The potency of each of these has been
measured and a subset of 73 highly potent and selective compounds selected for further study. All compounds
in the GHCDL were chosen for their drug-like physicochemical properties that predict good absorption and
distribution when taken orally. Therefore it seems reasonable to hypothesize that within the 359 compounds
that strongly inhibit T. gondii growth are those that will be effective against toxoplasmosis when given orally
and thus excellent starting points from which to develop new drugs. Dr. Alday's research will systematically
evaluate this hypothesis in three parts. First, the potency of all 73 compounds will be veriﬁed. An initial study of
the structure-activity relationships of the three most promising will be done. Secondly, Dr. Alday will determine
the mechanism of action for the top 10 most promising compounds by creating resistant mutants and
identifying relevant mutations using whole-genome sequencing. Finally, the effectiveness of the top 10
compounds will be tested in mouse models of infection.
 Dr. Alday is a physician-scientist at Oregon Health & Science University and the Portland VA Medical
Center. Clinically, he is trained in internal medicine and infectious disease (ID), rotates on the inpatient ID
consult service, and has an outpatient ID clinic. His PhD is in biochemistry, with a focus on the physical
chemistry of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. This unusual background gives him a
strong background from which to pursue the work described in this CDA application. He has worked in the
Portland VAMC Experimental Chemotherapy Lab with Dr. Michael Riscoe and Dr. Stone Doggett over the past
three years, developing proﬁciency in the molecular and biochemical methods needed to evaluate drugs and
their mechanism of action in protozoan parasites. The work proposed in this CDA will provide Dr. Alday with
further training in drug design, evaluation of drug mechanisms, and in vivo efﬁcacy studies he needs to
become an independent VA investigator. As part of this training grant, he has assembled a team of senior
scientists and physician-scientists with expertise in molecular parasitology and drug development. Collectively,
they have mentored dozens of trainees towards independence. This panel will meet formally every six months
to review Dr. Alday's progress. Additionally, this panel will provide input regarding experimental approaches,
review manuscripts prior to publication, and give advise about career development. Dr. Alday will take
graduate-level classes in pharmacokinetics and genome sequencing and present his work at scientiﬁc
meetings. Prior to the end of this CDA, Dr. Alday will have identiﬁed promising lead compounds ready for
advancement down the drug development pathway as well as new targets for future drug development efforts.
Moving these leads forward will form the basis for VA Merit Review and NIH R01 grant applications that will
establish him as an independent clinician-scientist devoted to caring for veterans afﬂicted by infectious
diseases through service and research."
10767123,"Approximately 800,000 people die from suicide each year and the recent data show that the suicide rate in the
United States has increased 33% from 1999 to 2017. United States military veterans have an increased risk of
suicide compared with the general population, and approximately 18 to 22 veterans die from suicide each day.
It has been reported that up to 90% of individuals who complete suicide have an underlying psychiatric
disorder. Suicidal ideation in war veterans is often associated with post-traumatic disorder (PTSD) or
depression, conditions that often coexist. In addition, as a fundamental factor in the provocation of depression,
chronic stress is associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Also, a history of prior exposure to trauma or
to chronic stress is an extremely potent risk factor for PTSD. In preclinical models, chronic stress has been
shown to induce changes in behavioral paradigms that can be used to measure aspects of suicidal behavior
such as impulsive, aggressive, and depressive-like behaviors. Recent evidence indicate that inflammation, as
manifested by increased levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, contributes to the pathophysiology of suicidality.
However, there is a critical need for studies that are designed to determine the role of specific components of
the immune system in suicidal behavior in order to identify novel therapeutic targets. The complement system
is part of the innate arm of immunity, but also regulates many aspects of the adaptive immune response.
Complement can be activated via the classical, lectin or alternative pathway with complement component 3
(C3) as the converging point of the activation pathways. Our recent study showed an important role of C3 in
chronic stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. However, it is not known whether chronic stress-
induced complement activation mediates suicidal behavior. We hypothesize that classical pathway mediates
stress-induced complement activation leading to suicidal behavior. In supporting this, our published and
preliminary studies found that (1) C3 and C1qa (a key component of classical pathway) are highly expressed in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of depressed suicide subjects; 2) exposure to chronic stress conditions induces
increases in C1qa and C3 protein levels in mouse PFC; and (3) inhibition of C3 by gene knockout (C3 KO)
significantly ameliorated chronic stress-induced aggressive and depressive-like behavior, and infiltration of
monocytes into mouse PFC. To further understand the role of complement activation in suicidal behavior, we
propose the three Specific Aims to 1) determine the role of complement activation pathway in suicide (with
depression or PTSD diagnosis) subjects; 2) investigate whether complement classical pathway is critical to
stress-induced suicidal behavior; and 3) determine whether central complement system mediates stress-
induced suicidal behavior. Given the important role of immune pathways in suicidal behavior, identifying novel
regulatory mechanisms may provide avenues to develop newer therapeutics for suicidal behavior."
10767124,"RESEARCH STRATEGY: The primary research objective of this proposal is to address how subtypes of
enteroendocrine cells change their activity (secretion) or state of differentiation in response to injury signals. A
better understanding of intestinal injury repair is critical to VA health priorities; the prevalence of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) has more than doubled among VA patients since 1998 and at least half of patients won’t
experience full mucosal healing with existing therapies. Hormones produced in intestinal enteroendocrine cells
(EEC) are altered in patients with IBD and can promote epithelial healing, but there is little understanding of
how EEC secretion is regulated during injury. The study of EECs has been limited because they are rare,
heterogenous, and not amenable to long-term primary culture with existing methods. To address this gap, we
have developed a new experimental system to culture EECs from primary colon samples in long-term
monolayers that supports all known EEC subtypes. We have discovered that subtypes of EEC are dynamically
altered with a simple experimental injury in vitro. The altered EECs increase the expression of factors that
promote intestinal healing. The goal of this proposal is to determine the cellular and transcriptional basis of
how subtypes of EEC respond to intestinal injury through altered activity or differentiation. Our Aims are to (1)
test the hypothesis that subtypes of EECs are adaptively reprogrammed by injury induced endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, (2) test the hypothesis that microenvironmental injury signals reprogram EECs to
increase hormone secretion, and (3) define the transcriptional mechanisms of EEC reprogramming during
injury at single-cell resolution. The expected outcome of this work is to establish the new paradigm that
EECs undergo adaptive reprogramming during injury which will serve as the foundation for future independent
grant proposals. Additionally, we expect to discover novel secreted factors or altered states of differentiation in
EEC that would lead to new potential treatments for veterans suffering from intestinal or metabolic disorders.

10767298,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal describes the use of fundamental chemical properties to alter the reactivity of reagents for
the synthesis of biomedically important compounds. The role of carbohydrates in biological systems cannot be
overstated and is of great interest to scientific research. Robust, practical, and general methods for glycosylation
reactions with predictable stereoselectivity will enable further research in the role of sugars in biological chemistry
and medicine. Despite recent advances, glycan synthesis remains a challenging endeavor largely reserved for
specialists in sugar chemistry, and a general, selective synthesis of 2-deoxy-β-glycosides remains elusive.
Hydrogen-bond-donor catalysts will be used to alter the innate reactivity of 2-deoxy-a-phosphate donors for the
selective synthesis of 2-deoxy-β-glycosides (K99). The synthesis relies on the in situ generation of a phosphate
ester glycosyl donor, and on the identification of a tailored organocatalyst to promote stereospecific
glycosylations by simultaneously activating the electrophile (the donor) and the nucleophile (the acceptor).
Developing a general method for the synthesis of 2-deoxy-β-glycosides 1) provides a solution for the
glycosylation of sugars lacking the C2 functionality often used as a directing group via anchimeric assistance, 2)
enables further research on their role in biological chemistry and medicine, and 3) provides an alternative
strategy for the synthesis of biologically active natural products.
 Secondly, the chemical properties of C–S bonds will be used for the synthesis of novel donor-acceptor
Stenhouse adducts, DASAs (R00). Though Stenhouse adducts were introduced in 2014, they are used in drug
delivery, dynamic phase transfer, polymers, liquid crystals, wavelength-selective photoswitching, and
chemosensing applications. Despite their promising applications, DASAs are currently limited by their structural
diversity. Only amine donors and two acceptors are generally used in DASA systems today. Novel adducts with
sulfur, phosphine, oxygen, or other heteroatom donors will expand the pool of applications and provide more
efficient compounds for known applications. The synthesis relies on using 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde, an
economical starting material that will circumvent reactivity problems faced when using furfural. 2-
Thiophenecarboxaldehyde bears a weaker and longer C–S bond in place of the C–O bond responsible for the
inability to incorporate other donor functionality in DASAs when using furfural; thiophene derivatives also carry
less electron density on the carbon atoms, making it a perfect substrate for ring opening upon condensing an
acceptor molecule. If the C–S bond is not sufficiently weak, the polarizable sulfur will be activated using thiophilic
Lewis acids. Synthesizing novel Stenhouse adducts 1) provides additional DASAs to explore applications listed
above, 2) enables further research on the chemical properties of these new photoswitches, and 3) provides an
opportunity to develop additional applications."

10781227,"SUMMARY
This project aims to examine the synergy between Hippo/Yap and Wnt/b-catenin signaling to induce cell cycle
reentry and proliferation in adult mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
(hiPSC-CMs). Our team of experts in cardiac development, iPSC-based disease modeling, Yap and Wnt
signaling, and cardiac regeneration is poised to address the overall hypothesis that Yap and Wnt signaling
synergistically induce sarcomere disassembly and CM proliferation and their activities are enhanced by
disruption of structural barriers such as cell-cell contact and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Based
on compelling preliminary data from both Martin and Wu Labs, we show that induction of Yap signaling in the
adult mouse heart drives cytoskeletal rearrangement and initiation of cell cycle activity after myocardial infarction
(MI) while the treatment of hiPSC-CMs with CHIR, a small molecule activator of canonical Wnt/b-catenin
signaling, induces their massive expansion that is enhanced by disrupting cell-cell contact. We propose to
address our experimental hypotheses by completing three independent, yet interrelated Specific Aims: 1)
Address the hypothesis that YAP and Wnt signaling synergize to breakdown sarcomeric assembly and
cytoskeletal structure during cardiomyocyte proliferation. We will determine whether YAP and Wnt
signaling synergistically regulate sarcomere gene expression and assembly by introducing the Yap5SA
transgene and conditional b-catenin gain-of-function (GOF) alleles in the mouse heart to examine changes in
the expression of sarcomeric genes and their myofibrillar assembly. In parallel, we will assess the effect of the
Yap5SA transgene and CHIR treatment on hiPSC-CMs. We will also determine whether Wnt and YAP-induced
reduction in sarcomere assembly enhances cell cycle gene expression and CM proliferation and maintains an
active chromatin state in adult CMs by simultaneously inducing Yap5SA transgene and b-catenin signaling by
b-catenin GOF allele in adult CM and in hiPSC-CMs beyond that achieved with each treatment alone. 2) Address
the hypothesis that the disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions will enhance CM proliferation
via gain in YAP and Wnt signaling. We will determine whether the disruption of cell-cell contacts will enhance
CM proliferation via gain in YAP and Wnt signaling by knocking down cell contact protein N-Cadherin (N-Cad)
while activating proliferation with Yap5SA and b-catenin GOF allele or with CHIR in mice and in hiPSC-CMs. We
will also determine whether the disruption of cell-ECM interactions will enhance CM proliferation via gain in YAP
and Wnt signaling. 3) Address the hypothesis that the induction of YAP and Wnt signaling specifically in
the MI border zone will synergistically enhance CM proliferation. This translational aim will examine the
synergy between Yap and Wnt signaling in the setting of MI using an infarct border zone-specific ANF enhancer
to examine the synergy of Yap/b-catenin signaling in infarcted mice, stressed hiPSC-CMs, and infarcted pigs."
10781267,"Ex vivo intraoperative surgical basal margin analysis in head and neck cancer resection: clinical
validation
In a clinical collaboration with the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Netherlands—led by Oral and
Maxillofacial Surgeon, Dr. Witjes—we will advance and clinically test an intraoperative dual-aperture
fluorescence ratio (dAFR) imaging system and an automated data analysis (ADA) approach that can analyze an
entire resected-tissue basal margin in <1 min for head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) resection
surgery. This is a significant improvement upon currently used frozen-section histopathology that requires >30
min and can only be done for a limited number of resected-tissue locations. The project will specifically focus on
improving detection and localization of inadequate (positive and close) basal surgical margins, critical for patient
survival. Over 3 million individuals across the globe are diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) each year. At present, surgical intervention is the primary treatment; however, owing to the complexity
of the anatomy in the head and neck, >20% of procedures may fail to attain tumor-free surgical basal margins
(defined as greater than 5 mm of healthy tissue surrounding the deep edge of the resected tumor). Unfortunately,
because of slow resected-tissue processing, patients are often sent home before margins are fully assessed.
While some patients can return for re-resection, for many, health concerns or substantial post-resection
reconstruction surgeries make re-resection infeasible, and radiotherapy and/or chemoradiotherapy is needed.
Patients with inadequate margins have <15% chance of surviving for 5 years post-surgery, compared to a >80%
chance of survival for patients with free margins and no metastatic disease. Before dAFR imaging and surgery,
patients are injected with a fluorescent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted antibody, and
intraoperative dAFR images of resected basal margins are taken and analyzed. Our preliminary results from a
proof-of-concept dAFR imaging system indicate almost perfect detection rate of inadequate as well as clear
margins. In this project, we propose necessary imaging system upgrades and to develop an automated data
analysis to remove the need for clinical expert manual segmentation of images. The proposed approach will be
validated and tested against state-of-the-art surgical guidance methods in an 80-patient clinical study at UMCG,
in terms of detection and localization of inadequate basal margins through ROC and LROC assessments."
10746458,"Mobility impairments including gait disorders and falls are debilitating and common, yet poorly understood in
older persons with HIV (OPWH). The fronto-striatal circuitry is critical for brain control of locomotion and has
been shown to be disrupted in HIV. Inflammation persists in HIV despite effective antiretroviral therapy and is a
key driver of cognitive impairment among persons with HIV (PWH); the frontal cortex, which supports motivation
and learning, is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of ongoing inflammation in the context of treated
HIV, placing OPWH at risk for resulting mobility disorders. The role of brain circuits and neuroinflammation in
gait and falls in OPWH has not been investigated to date, including whether walking performance under attention-
demanding conditions could be durably improved with training, and thus amenable to remediation. We propose
to use a validated dual-task walking paradigm (predictive of falls in older persons), a burst measurement (i.e.,
repeated trials) design, and functional-near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to determine the effect of HIV on brain
activation levels and trajectories of walking in 120 OPWH (age ³ 50ys) and 120 controls without HIV. We will
use multiple MRI methods to determine disruptions in the fronto-striatal circuitry and select markers of
neuroinflammation to identify mechanisms of brain control of walking and risk of falls in OPWH. Brain activation
patterns and learning trajectories of walking and improvements in their efficiency due to practice may be novel
biomarkers to identify OPWH at risk of developing mobility impairments and falls as they survive into older age.
Findings from this study will direct physical, cognitive, and pharmacological treatments to improve functional
brain control of walking, which in turn will lead to interventions to reduce fall risk in OPWH."
10783096,"This proposal is a competing renewal application of R01 GM117675 that uses a multidisciplinary approach to
enhance our understanding of protein α-N-terminal methylation. The α-N-terminal methylation plays an
essential role in regulating cell mitosis, chromatin interactions, and DNA repair. Its level is increased as
response of cellular stress, aging, and developmental processes. The increasing occurrences of α-N-terminal
methylation on the canonical X-P-K/R motif and noncanonical motifs highlight the importance of this
underexplored modification. However, there are major gaps remain in our understanding of these fundamental
biological processes. Filling these gaps is essential to elucidate the α-N-terminal methylation-mediated
pathways and to enhance the opportunity to devise novel therapeutic approaches. The objective of this
research is to develop novel chemical tools and apply them to understand the pathway and functions mediated
protein α-N-terminal methylation. Meanwhile, we will elucidate the molecular basis for substrate specificity of
human methyltransferase like 13 that methylates the the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha containing the
new GKEK motif at the α-N-terminus. Taken together, we believe that this research effort has the great
potential to provide a clearer understanding of mechanisms and inhibition of NTMTs, and shed lights on the
biological impact of protein α-N-terminal methylation. Accomplishment of the proposed work will provide new
chemical tools for both basic biology research and has the opportunity to enhance the development of novel
therapeutic approaches to target α-N-terminal methylation-involved pathways."
10783098,"A unique feature of parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa, such as Toxoplasma gondii, is the presence of a
single tubular mitochondrion, which is essential for parasite survival and a validated drug target. Most studies
of the apicomplexan mitochondrion have focused on its biochemistry and physiology. By contrast little is known
about the machinery that controls mitochondrial division and that regulate its structure, information that would
be critical for a thorough exploration of the mitochondrion as a drug target. Toxoplasma's singular
mitochondrion is very dynamic and undergoes morphological changes throughout the parasite's life cycle
including during the transition from the intracellular to the extracellular environment. While inside a host cell the
mitochondrion is maintained in a lasso shape that stretches around the parasite periphery where it has regions
of coupling with the parasite pellicle, suggesting the presence of membrane contact sites. Promptly after exit
from the host cell, these contact sites disappear, and the mitochondrion collapses indicating that dynamic
membrane contact sites regulate the positioning of the mitochondrion. Neither the functional significance nor
the proteins needed for the contact between Toxoplasma's mitochondrion and pellicle are known. We have
discovered a novel protein, Fip1, that associates with the mitochondrion and that when knocked out the normal
morphology of the mitochondrion is severely affected. In intracellular fip1 knockout parasites the mitochondrion
is not in a lasso shape as seen in wildtype parasites, but instead it is collapsed. Additionally, proper
mitochondrial segregation is disrupted in the knockout parasites, resulting in parasites with no mitochondrion
and mitochondrial material outside of the parasites. These gross morphological changes are associated with a
significant reduction of parasite propagation and can be rescued by reintroduction of a wildtype copy of Fip1.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that Fip1 mediates contact between the mitochondrion and the parasite pellicle in
a regulatable fashion, and that the Fip1 dependent mitochondrial morphology and dynamics are critical for
parasite propagation. Through a combination of molecular genetics, microscopy and proteomics we will
address the functional relevance and the mechanics of the mitochondrial morphology. In aim one we will
conduct a thorough in vivo and in vitro phenotypic characterization of Fip1 mutant strains to determine the role
of Fip1 and mitochondrial shape in parasite viability. Aim two focuses on identifying and characterizing
components of the Fip1 complex that mediates the association of the mitochondrion with the periphery of the
parasites. Finally, in aim three we will determine the regulatory mechanisms that drive the mitochondrial
morphological changes as the parasite exits its host cell. In conjunction, these experiments will shed light onto
the molecular mechanisms driving and regulating the morphodynamics of the Toxoplasma mitochondrion. As
the mitochondrion of this important human pathogen is essential for its survival and a validated drug target, our
studies will uncover novel targets for the development on new therapeutics."
10771260,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, negatively affecting the lives of millions
of individuals worldwide. Chronic ethanol exposure is known to alter multiple molecular pathways throughout
the central nervous system, including aberrant neuroimmune signaling. As part of the Integrative Neuroscience
Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA) Neuroimmune consortium, the proposed collaborative research project will focus
on the contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to molecular adaptations in the neuroimmune system
and development of AUD. The non-coding transcriptome significantly outnumbers the protein-coding
transcripts, but the biological function of most non-coding RNAs has yet to be determined. Several studies
have suggested that lncRNAs are critical epigenetic regulators of genomic structure and long-term gene
expression. We hypothesis that lncRNAs are epigenetic modulators of gene expression in response to ethanol
that actively coordinate persistent alterations in cellular function and animal behavior. We have proposed three
specific aims to experimentally test this hypothesis and help accomplish the overall goals of the INIA
consortium. Aim 1 will use Perturb-Seq to functionally test the involved of lncRNAs in neuroimmune gene
expressing using an established in vitro model of ethanol exposure. Combining use of the clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing approach with high-throughput RNA-
Sequencing this aim will identify neuroimmune pathways regulated by specific lncRNAs. Aim 2 will use
chromosome conformation capture sequencing to demonstrate physical changes in the spatial orientation of
chromatin (e.g., promoter-enhancer interactions) due to excessive ethanol exposure. This specific aim will
create a new genome-wide chromatin interaction map that will identify regulatory elements involved in the
ethanol-responsive neuroimmune pathways. Aim 3 will use CRISPR-mediated genome editing in vivo
strategies to determine the role of individual lncRNAs in regulating neuroimmune activation and ethanol-related
behavioral phenotypes. This specific aim will create several novel genetically engineered lines of mice, for
multiple collaborative projects, to test ethanol-related behaviors and molecular mechanisms associated with
excessive ethanol exposure. Completion of the proposed research will broaden our understanding for
epigenetic regulation of the neuroimmune system in AUD and determine molecular adaptations underlying
excessive ethanol exposure."
10771267,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The three-dimensional (3D) genome organization in the nucleus is of vital importance to genome function. The
vast majority of the existing 3D genome studies, however, are based on population-based assays that are
unable to unveil the functional roles of 3D genome structures at single-cell resolution in complex tissues.
Recent advent in single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technologies has enabled genomic mapping of chromatin
interactions in individual cells, but the analysis of scHi-C data remains a significant challenge. In particular,
computational methods that can effectively analyze scHi-C data to extract multiscale 3D genome features are
significantly lacking, limiting our ability to reveal the variability of structure and function connections in
heterogeneous cell populations. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop state-of-the-art
computational tools for scHi-C data analysis that effectively identify multiscale single-cell 3D genome features
and connect them to genome function. Specifically, we will (1) develop algorithms for scHi-C data processing
and imputation to delineate multiscale 3D genome features; (2) develop computational methods to connect 3D
genome structure and function in heterogeneous cell population; and (3) develop an integrative visualization
platform to navigate single-cell 3D genome organization. The methods developed in this project can be applied
to all types of scHi-C data generated by different single-cell chromatin interaction assays to reveal 3D genome
features at multiple scales, quantifying their variability and predicting their functional outcomes. The new tools
and resources from this project will be publicly accessible through our new visualization platform that provides
integrative and interactive navigation of scHi-C data and other data types. Overall, our project will greatly
facilitate the use of scHi-C data by the broad scientific community and be of high value to a diverse group of
biomedical researchers."
10771268,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chimeric receptor antigen (CAR) T cells are transforming cancer treatment by providing tumor-specific,
molecularly targeted therapies. However, even though current clinical applications of CAR T cell-based cancer
immunotherapies such as Kymriah or Yescarta induce remission in most cases, long-term disease control, which
is especially needed in pediatric and young adult cancer patients with high-risk malignancies, remains a major
clinical challenge. In fact, malignant relapse continues to be the leading cause of death post CAR T cell therapy.
Insufficient CAR T cell persistence in vivo is a major obstacle to reducing the risk of relapse and improving
survival. We have developed a novel platform for long-lasting tumor immunosurveillance based on continuous
in vivo generation of naïve CAR T cells. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis, based on our published and
unpublished data, that after the completion of the initial course of intensive chemotherapy long-lasting T cell
immunity to cancer antigens can be established by using hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
engineered to express a tumor cell-targeting CAR and delivered into the patient’s thymus. Image-guided
intrathymic injection is a minimally invasive procedure that harnesses the thymus of cancer patients as an in vivo
bioreactor, thus offering an innovative and also relatively simple and low-toxic clinical method for sustainable
production of highly potent naïve designer T cells from genetically manipulated HSPCs. Direct thymic
engraftment of HSPCs (bypassing the bone marrow) eliminates the need for myelo-ablative conditioning while
preserving the desired outcome, i.e., long-term generation of naïve antigen-specific T cells. Thymic engraftment
will be facilitated by thymic irradiation combined with either cell delivery to the thymus by intrathymic injection or
by enhancing the thymic homing capacity of intravenously administered HSPCs by overexpression of thymus-
specific homing molecules. We will focus on CD19 CARs as a model system to establish proof of concept of our
approach because CD19 CARs have become the gold standard for evaluating novel CAR technologies. Our
experimental approaches include strategies designed to allow successful thymic negative selection of CD19
CAR-transduced HSPCs. Over time the project is expected to expand to include a variety of CAR specificities.
CAR T cell development from HSPCs will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo, including assays assessing
thymic hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and T cell differentiation from HSPCs within the thymic epithelial
microenvironment. We will demonstrate in vivo efficacy (B cell depletion and anti-tumor activity) of the most
promising CAR expression system in syngeneic mouse models. Translational studies in humanized mice,
including a patient-derived pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia model, will be performed during the final year
of the project. In sum, this research will test the novel paradigm of CAR T cell development in vivo, promising to
make tumor immunosurveillance by CAR T cells broadly available as post-consolidation therapy of high-risk
malignancies in pediatric and young adult patient populations."
10758535,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although significant advances have been made in elucidating the cellular, biophysical and molecular
mechanisms of learning and memory, much less is known about the ways in which mnemonic processes are
embedded in neuronal networks. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide insights into the design principles
that govern the implementation of memories within the complex environment of a neural circuit. Studies will focus
on an established in vitro analogue of operant conditioning (QC) in a relatively complex circuit, which is amenable
to population-wide, cellular, and biophysical analyses. A combination of intra- and extracellular
electrophysiological techniques, voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging, dimensionality reduction analysis, and
computational modeling will identify and characterize loci of non-synaptic and synaptic plasticity. In addition, the
project will examine the extent to which plasticity loci are shared between short- and long-term memory. Aim 1
will use intracellular recording techniques to examine loci of QC-induced plasticity. Previous correlates of OC in
this model system were restricted to increases in intrinsic excitability or electrical synapses of key neurons in the
circuit. Our recent results indicate QC also decreases the strength of an inhibitory synapse and the excitability
of a key neuron in the circuit. Aim 1 will examine other prime candidates of QC-induced synaptic and non-synaptic
plasticity, which have an established role in mediating the behavior. In addition, we will use intracellular
techniques to examine regions of the circuit that our recent VSD recordings have shown to exhibit QC-induced
changes in activity. Computational modeling will assess the ways in which loci work unilaterally or synergistically
to mediate the OC phenotype. Aim 2 will use a combination of intracellular recordings, VSD imaging, and
dimensionality reduction approaches to expand the search for additional sites of QC-induced plasticity and
search for low-dimensional 'signatures' of OC. The combined results from Aims 1 and 2 will provide for an
assessment of the scope of plasticity mechanisms associated with OC that is unprecedented in any system. A
further important question will be addressed by Aim 3, which will determine the extent to which sites for short-term
memory persist during long-term memory and, conversely, which sites of plasticity may be unique to long-term
memory. The present proposal will help develop a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which
memories are encoded in a relatively complex circuit, elucidate design principles of memory encoding, and
provide guidance for similar analyses in more complex systems."

 To date, no therapy exists to restore vision to the over 64 million people worldwide who are legally blind from
diseases that damage the optic nerve. Neuro-protective strategies aimed at preventing damaged retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) from degenerating and neuro-regenerative strategies aimed at promoting axon growth confer modest gains in
vision after optic nerve crush injury when applied alone. Moreover, these approaches appear to be lacking in guidance
cues as regenerating RGC axons have been reported to have circuitous projections, with 10-20% of axons exhibiting
premature branching and 40% of axons having regenerated aberrantly, making u-turns and extending back towards the eye
or growing into the opposite optic nerve. We have shown that exogenously applied electric fields (EFs) not only
promote RGC axon growth but appear to also be able to control the direction of axon growth. This suggests that EFs
may be exploited to not only “drive” axon growth but also “steer” axons to grow towards intended targets. Indeed, in vivo
stimulation with asymmetric waveforms was found to be effective at directing full-length optic nerve regeneration,
without evidence of aberrant targeting, and restoring partial visual function (local field potential recordings in the superior
colliculus and pattern electroretinogram) after crush injury. Given this, we hypothesized that combining EF
stimulation with other neuro-regenerative strategies would have synergistic effects on promoting optic nerve
regeneration. More targeted regeneration could confer increased gains in visual function. Our multi-disciplinary
consortium between neuro-ophthalmologists, developmental biologists, neuro-anatomists, neurosurgeons,
electrophysiologists, and electrical engineers proposes to test the efficacy of combining neuro-protective and neuro-
regenerative strategies with EF application to direct RGC axon regeneration and restore visual function to adult rats after
optic nerve crush injury. Additionally, we will map and characterize the morphology and trajectory of regenerated axons
in whole rat brains using 3D light sheet microscopy and SHIELD tissue clearing histology and assess whether EFs direct
target specific regeneration."
10780974,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) carries a dismal prognosis. Understanding the mechanisms that lead
to the development of pancreatic cancer and to identify markers that distinguish between non-cancerous and
cancerous lesions is the greatest hope for early detection and early treatment of patients. This proposal
focusses on identifying early detection markers that would allow resection of tumors at a time point where they
are still local. It is our hypothesis that pancreatic high-grade lesions significantly distinguish from low-
grade lesions by expressing PADI1. We further hypothesize that PADI1 and its citrullinated substrates
can be detected in pancreatic biopsy and may form a panel of markers specific for early detection of
PDA. To test this we will: verify PADI1 as a specific marker for HG lesions and test its presence in liquid
biopsies (Specific Aim 1); characterize citrullinated fibrinogen as a PADI1 substrate and marker for pancreatic
cancer (Specific Aim 2); and identify pancreas cancer specific PADI1-citrullinated substrates (intracellular and
secreted) in lesions and in liquid biopsy (Specific Aim 3). Successful completion of our project will identify
secreted protein markers that are detectable in easily accessible liquid biopsy (blood serum) and distinguish
between pancreatic non-cancerous lesions and PanIN3 (carcinoma in situ) and PDA lesions."
10747384,"Major barriers to chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) research and preemptive treatment are the
inability to predict early following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), who will develop cGVHD,
and lack of specific and sensitive risk biomarkers of cGVHD before onset is detectable by clinical symptoms.
This project will use already collected plasma and PBMCs samples from BMTCTN 0201, 1202 and multicenter
pediatric and adults studies (NCT00075816, NCT01879072, and NCT02194439) and the Pasquarello tissue
bank at the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute to analyze proteomic and cellular signatures associated with
impending onset of clinical cGVHD, and overall survival using machine learning (ML) versus established
statistics. Proposed markers are based on previous published and unpublished studies and will include other
novel or hypothesized factors. We will use the tow BMT CTN and NCT02194439 biorepositories with sample
size totaling ~1300 HCT patients (669 cGVHD in comparison to 664 non-cGVHD controls) at day +90 post-
HCT and 14 plasma proteins [Stimulation 2 (ST2; the interleukin (IL)-33 receptor), chemokine (C-X-C motif)
ligand 9 (CXCL9), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), osteopontin (OPN), and C-C motif chemokine 15
(CCL15), CD163, CXCL10, IL17, BAFF, B7H3, DKK3, IL1RACP, MCSF, CCL5] as well as 35 markers on 10+
populations totaling up to 300 parameters in a cohort of 200 patients with available PBMCs and paired plasma
at day +90±10 post-HCT with mass cytometry. We will then be in a unique position in the field of cGVHD to
address major questions: (a) Are plasma biomarkers or cellular biomarkers or the combination of both more
amenable to provide better specificity/sensitivity? (b) Can we increase sensitivity and specificity of cGVHD
biomarkers panels by using ML statistics? (c) Can we discover new key biologic drivers of cGVHD using ML
algorithms? As ML techniques are likely to provide better prediction when large amount of data with high-
dimensional covariates and nonlinear relationships are used, we hypothesize that ML analysis will increase
sensitivity and specificity of our panels as well as increase biology granularity. Specific Aim 1 will address if a
day-90 fourteen-plasma biomarker panel on 1300 patients’ samples, using ML, predicts risk of cGVHD with
higher specificity and sensitivity than established statistics. Specific Aim 2 will address if a day-90±10 thirty-
five-cellular biomarker panel, using single-cell mass cytometry and ML, is predictive of development of cGVHD
in a 30 cases vs 30 controls discovery cohort. Specific Aim 3 will address if a comprehensive day-90±10
proteomic biomarker panel only, or cellular biomarker panel only, or a combined proteomic and cellular
biomarker panel in a validation cohort of 200 paired plasma/PBMCs samples, will improve prediction of cGVHD
risk. Upon completion, these studies will result in novel biomarker panels that may facilitate cGVHD risk
stratification for HCT patients and identify candidates for new preemptive approaches."
10747404,"A basic understanding of neuron-glia interactions is key to linking altered immune function to disrupted neural
circuitry and cognition present in major psychiatric diseases. Microglia are a resident immune cell in the cerebral
cortex, and one of their main functions under physiological conditions is to modify synaptic connections among
neurons. How these activities extend to influence higher-order functional networks in cortical circuits is not clear,
particularly in brain regions crucial for cognitive function, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
 A key may lie in how neural circuit synchrony stimulates nearby microglial cell motility – i.e. active extension
and retraction of fine cellular processes – and, specifically, in how this relationship changes throughout
adolescence, a critical period for the development of PFC and higher cognition. Further, sex differences have
been established in some aspects of microglial function. Clarifying how sex modulates the role of microglia in
PFC circuit development is essential, especially given the dramatic sex differences in vulnerability to adolescent
onset of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia.
 The goal of the current project is to obtain a basic understanding of glial-neuronal-circuit interactions in the
mammalian prefrontal cortex. The planned approach (Aim 1) employs three-dimensional two-photon microscopy
and single neuron optogenetics in awake mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to elucidate how the structural
dynamics of microglial cells are driven by neuronal activity and oscillatory synchrony in local circuits. This will be
examined at distinct time windows from pre-adolescence into early adulthood and compared between males and
females. (Aim 2,3) To test whether, how, and when microglia activity is necessary for the establishment of adult
mPFC function, microglia will be selectively eliminated during restricted windows during adolescence and early
adulthood using a pharmacological strategy. Then in adulthood, sex- and adolescent-period specific effects on
the development of i) (Aim 2) spatiotemporal circuit dynamics in mPFC (functional network clustering, gamma
oscillations, theta-gamma coupling) will be measured using two-photon calcium imaging and dense electrical
recordings and ii) (Aim 3) PFC-dependent cognition will be assessed with an established odor-based attentional
set-shifting task.
 This project employs state-of-the-art optical techniques to study brain function of behaving animals with cell-
level precision. Results will identify when and how microglia interact with developing neuronal circuits to support
adult-level cognitive function under physiological conditions. Since microglia may be a key mediator of psychiatric
disease-relevant neuroimmune dysfunction, the basic science insights from this project, particularly afforded by
a sex- and developmental-period stratified approach, could transform the search for core pathophysiological
mechanisms and circuit-based treatments."
10775820,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of patients diagnosed with rectal cancer will receive radiation therapy to treat their tumors. Long-
term complications from radiation therapy directed to the colorectal region are bowel fibrosis, rectal wall damage,
bowel incontinence, rectal and bladder bleeding and pelvic fracture and there are no FDA approved treatments
to protect normal rectal and anal tissues from radiation-induced damage. Radiation exposure leads to free
radical-mediated oxidative damage to normal tissues leading to fibrosis. Cancer cells have increased metabolic
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), relative to normal cells, which have been shown to drive cancer
progression. Thus, suppressing radiation-induced ROS would act as both a radioprotector in normal tissues
while inhibiting pro-survival and progression pathways in cancer cells. BMX-001 is a small molecule antioxidant,
which scavenges ROS. Preliminary data demonstrate that BMX-001 protects rectal tissues from radiation-
induced damage, while enhancing colorectal cancer killing. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that BMX-
001 will protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage, while not protecting the cancer cells in patients
undergoing radiation therapy of rectal and anal cancers. Specific Aim 1 will determine the mechanism(s) by
which BMX-001 protects from radiation-induced epithelial dysfunction and how BMX-001 prevents blood chemo-
radiation toxicity. It will be determined whether BMX-001 prevents hematological chemoradiation toxicity through
the NRF2/MnSOD signaling and potential biomarkers of oxidative stress and GI damage will be identified in a
chronic in vivo model of radiation-induced damage. Specific Aim 2 will determine the safety and efficacy in
patients through Phase II clinical trials as a radioprotector of rectal cancers. A randomized phase II clinical trial
will determine whether BMX-001 is an efficacious radioprotector of normal tissues in rectal cancer patients
undergoing total neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery. Specific Aim 3 will identify potential
biomarkers that can be used to demonstrate radiation damage and radioprotector efficacy of BMX-001 in human
clinical specimens obtained from the Phase II trial. Surgically resected tumor and adjacent normal rectal tissues
from BMX-001 or placebo controlled patients after chemoradiation will be evaluated for inflammation, normal
tissue damage, fibrosis and oxidative stress. In addition, oxidative stress markers will be evaluated in blood and
urine samples. The completion of the studies will provide an in depth mechanistic understanding of the
mechanisms by which BMX-001 inhibits normal tissue injury and whether BMX-001 can be used in rectal cancer
patients as an effective radioprotector and could be universally adapted for treatment of other cancers receiving
pelvic irradiation."

 For the competing renewal of our R01NS34467-19 project, we propose to continue collaborative studies
between the Zlokovic and the Holtzman labs aimed at understanding at the cellular, molecular and systems level,
and in allele-specific and gender-specific manner apolipoprotein E (apoE) effects on the cerebrovascular system,
specifically, 1) how they contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neurovascular dysfunction, neurodegenerative,
amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau disorders; and 2) how targeting apoE-low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
(LRP1) interactions on different cerebrovascular cell types can mitigate and/or block cerebrovascular and brain
damage causing dementia in AD. We will focus on APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, and APOE3
that carries a significantly lower risk for AD. Neurovascular apoE is produced by astrocytes, pericytes, and
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Based on published and our pilot data, we hypothesize that apoE
isoform-specific interactions with LRP1 on brain vascular cells provide a pathogenic link to apoE-related
cerebrovascular disorder by controlling in an apoE-isoform-specific manner: 1) cyclophilin A (CypA)-matrix-
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway which disrupts blood-brain barrier (BBB) and arterial blood vessels; and
2) Ab and tau clearance on capillary and arterial vessels. Specifically, the apoE4 pathophysiological
cerebrovascular effects accelerate cerebrovascular, neurodegenerative, Ab and tau disorders, whereas apoE3
has less disruptive effects. ApoE allele-specific effects on BBB integrity, vascular and neuronal function and
structure will be studied in new APOE knockinflox/flox E3F and E4F mice with apoE cell-specific deletion from
astrocytes, pericytes, or VSMCs (AIM 1); and, in the context of Ab and tau pathology, in APP/PS1-21 mice (AIM
2) and P301S tau mice (AIM 3), respectively, crossed with our new E3F and E4F mice with apoE cell-specific
deletion from astrocytes, pericytes, or VSMCs. We will therapeutically target LRP1 and CypA-MMP9 pathway
with intravenous cell-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of LRP1 minigene to endothelium
and pericytes, and CypA inhibition with Debio 025. Understanding the effects of astrocyte-derived, pericyte-
derived and/or VSMC-derived apoE on cerebrovascular and neuronal functions, Ab and tau clearance and
pathology, in an allele-specific and gender-specific manner, will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis
and treatment of AD neurovascular dysfunction, neurodegeneration, Ab and tau disorders. If successful, this
could lead to new therapeutic approaches targeting LRP1 and/or CypA-MMP9 pathway in different brain vascular
cells to mitigate and/or block apoE’s cerebrovascular and brain damage causing dementia in AD."
10772281,"ABSTRACT
Retrotransposons are highly enriched in animal genome. Their activation can rewrite the host genetic information
and fundamentally impact host biology. While developmental activation of retrotransposons can bring hosts
benefits, such as against virus infection, uncontrolled activation promotes diseases or potentially drives aging.
Despite their abundance and fundamental impacts on host physiology and pathology, the study of
retrotransposons remains an underexplored area of biomedical research. Using new tools and biological systems
developed by my team, in the long-term, we aim to characterize the retrotransposon replication cycle and explore
the impact of their activation to the hosts under physiological and pathological conditions.
Upon activation, retrotransposons use their mRNA as templates to synthesize double-stranded DNA for making
new insertions in the host genome. While the reverse transcriptase encoded by them can synthesize the 1st-
strand DNA, how the 2nd-strand DNA is generated remains largely unknown. Our recent studies on both
Drosophila and mouse retrotransposons indicated that they hijack the alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) DNA repair
process from the hosts for a circularization step to synthesize their 2nd-strand DNA. Strikingly, we found that only
10% of replicated retrotransposon DNA achieve new insertions, while 90% exist as extrachromosomal circular
DNA (eccDNA). These results lead us to propose that alt-EJ plays a conserved function for retrotransposon DNA
replication by driving a circularization step, and that this step dominantly manufactures retrotransposon eccDNA
to impact on host biology. To test these hypotheses, we aim to characterize how alt-EJ mediates the
circularization step for retrotransposon DNA replication (Aim 1), to investigate how retrotransposon eccDNA can
generate genomic variation by integrating into the host genome (Aim 2), and to explore whether human
retrotransposons also hijack alt-EJ pathway for eccDNA biogenesis (Aim 3).
Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by identifying new mechanisms to understand
the replication process of the most abundant genomic elements. Meanwhile, our work will elucidate how
retrotransposon eccDNA could impact host genome by creating genomic variations. As such, our work will
provide a new perspective to understand the process and consequence of retrotransposon life cycle."

 Minority graduates are significantly underrepresented in biomedical PhD programs nationwide. Montana
State University (MSU), a research-intensive public land-grant university, serves a significant number of first-
generation rural and low-income students who rarely enroll in PhD programs. Likewise, Montana is home to
twelve Indigenous tribes, with >6.5% of Montana residents considered American Indians, but only 4.7% of
MSU’s undergraduates identify as Native, and no Native Americans have graduated from MSU’s biomedical
PhD programs in the past five years. To address these inequities, we have designed an evidence-based
postbaccalaureate program, PREP-MT, to prepare underrepresented minority graduates including first-
generation, rural, low-income students and Native Americans in Montana for a successful transition into
doctoral degree programs in the biomedical sciences. PREP-MT will equip recent minority graduates (PREP
scholars) with the experience, confidence, knowledge, and research skills to become highly successful PhD
students and graduates. Specifically, our program will pursue the following Specific Aims: (1) Provide in-depth,
mentored biomedical research experiences to PREP-MT scholars; (2) Enable PREP-MT to develop
professional and career skills relevant to a successful career in biomedical science; (3) Build a professional
support network for the PREP-MT scholars to create a sense of belonging as members of the biomedical
research community. Additionally, we will perform regular program evaluations, incorporate changes to
improve the PREP-MT program, and disseminate our findings to appropriate audiences. Our program is highly
feasible, because PREP-MT is synergistically integrated with established undergraduate and graduate
research training programs at MSU, increasing the opportunities for the scholars and maximizing our
resources. Our Multi-PI leadership team is uniquely positioned to manage the proposed program, since we
have a strong background in leading collaborative research and training, promoting minority involvement in
biomedical research, and collaborating with tribal and rural communities. More than 30 faculty with biomedical
research programs from ten departments who have demonstrated a commitment to training the next
generation of scientists have agreed to serve as mentors for the PREP-MT program. All mentors will receive
mentorship training through the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experience in Research and MSU’s
Indigenous Mentoring Program. The proposed PREP-MT program is innovative, because of its focus on Native
American and first generation rural and low-income graduates and because it emphasizes instilling a sense of
belonging in our PREP participants. In summary, we are confident that the PREP-MT program will significantly
enhance biomedical workforce development by increasing the access of minority groups in Montana to high-
quality PhD programs and impactful careers."

Prostate cancer (CaP) is the leading non-cutaneous cancer in men, accounting for roughly 1 in 5 new cases and
1 in 10 deaths from cancer per year. Few modifiable risk factors have been identified for CaP, limiting
opportunities for primary prevention. In the US, Black men experience over twice the rate of mortality from CaP
compared to White men, disparities that are partly explained by differences in neighborhood environmental
context. Black men are often exposed to higher burden of environmental pollutants due to segregation and
neighborhood disinvestment, which may contribute to disparities. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
are synthetic industrial chemicals of public health concern due to their ubiquitous presence and persistence in
the body and environment, as well as growing evidence of their adverse health impacts. Certain PFAS have
been classified as Group 2B (“possible”) carcinogens by the Institute of Agency for Cancer. Some studies in
populations with high occupational or community exposures to PFAS have shown elevated risk of CaP, but few
studies have examined these associations in large racially-diverse, population-based studies. I propose to study
three commonly measured PFAS (PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)
as potential risk factors for aggressive CaP and CaP disparities in New Jersey. I will develop a spatiotemporal
model of drinking water PFAS exposure using multiple geographic datasets capturing business, hydrology,
meteorologic, and census variables. Modeled PFAS exposure will be linked to masked residential address
histories collected from men diagnosed with CaP in the New Jersey State Cancer Registry to estimate the risk
of advanced CaP associated with increasing levels of PFAS. I will then conduct a pilot study among patients
seeking CaP treatment at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. I will evaluate differences in PFAS souces
by different sociodemographic groups, and study associations between serum PFAS and risk of biochemical
reccurrence among men treated for CaP. This research will be complemented by a training program to develop
knowledge and skills in health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, spatiotemporal modeling of
environmental chemicals, primary data collection and biospecimen collection, and molecular alterations involved
in prostate carcinogenesis. I have invited a multidisciplinary team of environmental and cancer researchers to
support my training. My short-term goals are to develop expertise in pathways through which PFAS and related
endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence CaP, and disseminate findings through conference presentations and
publications. My long-term goal is to become an independent scientist and expert in multilevel environmental
and biological pathways that influence CaP progression and outcomes. Preliminary data generated through this
project will support the development of an R01 proposal to clarify mechanisms through which PFAS and other
endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence tumor biology and risk of recurrence following treatment for CaP."

 In the US, approximately 50,000 oral and pharyngeal cancers (OPCs) are diagnosed annually
(10/100,000 incidence). Further, oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is about 15 times more common than OPC.
Patients diagnosed with OED are known to be at risk for malignant transformation (MT), and those treated for
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are known to be at elevated risk for cancer recurrence (CR). There is
little consensus about the optimal clinical surveillance pathways for these patients. Individuals with a history of
OSCC and potentially malignant oral lesions (PMOLs) harboring OED/OSCC can have widely variable clinical
presentation that overlaps with oral lesions of no malignant potential. Thus, clinicians may be reluctant to perform
serial scalpel biopsies on these patients. Commercially available diagnostic adjuncts lack adequate clinical
validation across the lesion disease spectrum. When OSCC or high-grade OED is diagnosed early, there is an
opportunity to provide appropriate timely treatment, and patient outcomes can improve dramatically. Thus, there
is a compelling need for new highly effective non-invasive precision oral lesion diagnostic technologies that can
be tailored for the needs of individual patients.
 This multi-institution prospective cohort study seeks to utilize and optimize first Point-of-Care Oral
Cytopathology Tool (POCOCT), a microfluidics ensemble and single cell image-based data acquisition system
employing artificial intelligence with interpretation of >100 image features including nuclear F-actin for precision
oral lesion diagnostics to be completed. Portable diagnostic tools and embedded algorithms will be optimized for
secondary and tertiary care settings for the first time. In this R01 study, POCOCT-derived OSCC CR and OED
MT models will be developed to elucidate population and patient-specific dynamic changes in numerical index
that yield key information related to CR and risk of MT. While past efforts focused on a single time point, this
same multimodal chip-based approach will be used to sample repeatedly during surveillance to identify the value
of speed of change to MT and CR. The overarching goals of this R01 study are: (1) to determine whether
cytological signatures, when examined serially over time, can lead to better risk prediction for CR, (2) to
determine if the same signatures can lead to earlier detection of local recurrence than the traditional clinical
pathway, and (3) to further optimize the POCOCT for precision lesion diagnostics of MT and CR using newly
identified biomarkers, including nuclear F-actin, and rare cell phenotypes identified by deep learning.
 This R01 will leverage unique NIDCR-Grand Opportunity databases for a new paradigm of precision
diagnostics. High risk patients will be longitudinally monitored in secondary and tertiary care settings at intervals,
and their risk trajectory will be established over time using personalized multivariate cytological signatures as
well as initial values. This prospective longitudinal cohort study has potential for more accurate lesion diagnosis,
improving patient survival and overall quality of life."

This K08 application is to support the research and career development of Dr. Adam Lietzan, a periodontist and
research assistant professor at the UNC Adams School of Dentistry. This award will provide Dr. Lietzan an
intensive mentored experience in order for him to complete the transition to an independent clinician-scientist
with a research program focused on understanding the dynamic immune responses to microbial dysbiosis during
periodontitis. As such, a training plan including didactic, hands-on, and career development experiences has
been put forth to enable this transition. During this award, Dr. Lietzan will gain skills/knowledge in: 1) host-
pathogen interactions, 2) cutting-edge techniques to evaluate immunological responses, 3) proposal
development, scientific writing, and oral presentations, and 4) leadership. This will allow Dr. Lietzan to develop
collaborative opportunities with scientists and clinicians across multiple disciplines and a high-quality
independent research program. Dr. Lietzan has established a multi-disciplinary team to provide expertise in
research training and mentorship in career development. Together this team will provide foundational training in
immunology, cell-based techniques, and animal models as well as help advise with critical aspects of the career
development. This will be coupled with a strong research plan. The onset of inflammation is facilitated by a
cascade of signaling molecules released by both canonical (e.g. macrophages) and noncanonical immune cells
(e.g. epithelial cells). The highly potent interleukin (IL)-1 family of signaling molecules primarily induces
inflammatory damage and is heavily implicated in periodontitis development and severity. Interleukin-37, an IL-
1 family member, conversely suppresses inflammation and has been shown to be dysregulated in severe forms
of periodontitis. The oral epithelial cell (OEC), which acts as a physical, chemical, and immunological shield
against infection, highly expresses IL-37 when exposed to microbial stimuli. Despite this knowledge, the impact
of IL-37 on OECs and the molecular interactions that underlie its anti-inflammatory bioactivity in periodontitis
remains largely uncharacterized. Here Dr. Lietzan seeks to fill this knowledge gap by dissecting the cellular
pathways that IL-37 modulates during microbial challenge of OECs using in vitro and in vivo model systems. The
molecular interactions between IL-37 and its receptors, which are highly expressed on OEC, will also be
delineated. Lastly, the relevance of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within the periodontal extracellular matrix on IL-
37 bioactivity will be investigated. Successful completion of this proposal will inform the development of new
and/or improve existing IL-37-centric interventions aimed at modulating chronic inflammation, such as that
associated with periodontitis. Together these training and research activities will be a significant step towards
Dr. Lietzan achieving his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist who can bridge the gap
between basic science discovery and clinical care advances through a multi-disciplinary approach."
10788379,"Nurses' daily encounters with ethical challenges in providing appropriate care—situations that may go
unresolved or are resolved unsatisfactorily—may lead to moral distress (i.e., the inability to carry out what is
believed to be an ethically appropriate action because of internal or external constraints). As a result, many
experience anxiety, depression, suicide risk, and other health-related problems. Little systematic research has
focused on factors that reduce or exacerbate moral distress—and, critically, how nurses' moral distress affects
nurse, patient, and organizational outcomes. This application builds upon our successful scientific program of
empirical bioethics research and uses a mixed-methods design to address three complementary objectives, by
surveying 20,652 practicing registered nurses (RNs) across four geographically diverse states (California,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Massachusetts) and innovatively linking these survey data to publicly available
patient outcome data sources. Thus, our first aim is to gather detailed data on nurses' perspectives on their
workplace challenges by identifying and assessing (via quantitative and qualitative methods) individual, work
environment, and ethical factors that contribute to moral distress and ethical confidence (i.e., self-confidence
about making ethics-related decisions in clinical practice). Our second aim is to develop (via cluster analysis) a
typology of practicing nurses, detailing similarities/differences across the personal, workplace, and ethics
issues that most impact moral distress, ethical confidence, health, and wellbeing; and from this typology,
recommend strategies for reducing moral distress , and create (via perceptual mapping) 3-dimensional
perceptual models showing how each type of nurse conceptualizes the relationships among these factors and
use these maps to assess safety culture as experienced by the different types of nurses, which will permit even
more specific recommendations about moral stress reduction. Our third aim is to examine how the
relationships identified in aim 1 are associated with outcomes of hospitalized patients, including patient
perceptions of care, inpatient mortality, hospital-acquired conditions, and excess days in acute care within 30
days of hospital discharge as well as nurses' well-being, patient safety grade and intention to leave. The
findings will provide a clearer picture of factors contributing to nurses' moral distress and to their ethical
confidence and provide evidence on how moral distress and ethical confidence affect patient safety and quality
outcomes. Healthcare is increasingly provided in complex organizations where resolving ambiguous ethical
issues may deplete the best of clinicians. Our findings will inform development of behavioral interventions,
structural/operational workplace changes, and message campaigns that reduce moral distress in existing and
future cohorts of nurses and improve the safety culture in which they work."

Summary
Ambient air pollution is a major pediatric public health concern due to its ubiquity and increased exposure patterns
affiliated with climate change over the next decade. Despite significant improvements in overall levels of air pollution
over the 20 years, 62% of children still live in areas that do not meet the US Environmental Protection Agency National
Ambient Air Quality Standards. Consistent evidence has shown that ambient air pollution exposure is detrimental to
children's respiratory health due primarily to behavioral patterns and timing of exposure during a sensitive window of
respiratory, endocrine, and immune system development, maturation, and modulation. Given the growing risk of
present and future pandemics, and consistent exposure to environmental stimuli, understanding the role of air pollution
on pediatric respiratory disease is of pressing public health importance. While

10784056,"Project Summary
Although neuronavigation systems are of crucial assistance during cerebrovascular surgery, they do not
integrate hemodynamics information needed to treat complex cerebrovascular malformations. The present
project aims at developing an Augmented Reality (AR) neuronavigation tool that will enable the visualization of
cerebral hemodynamics information in the surgical view. Our long-term goal is to contribute toward the
development and clinical adoption of visualization tools that allow for safe and accurate treatment of
cerebrovascular malformations. Our overall objectives in this project are to (i) develop a novel approach based
on deep neural networks that can classify and reconstruct 3D dynamic cerebral vasculature from 2D Digital
Subtraction Angiography (DSA) image series, (ii) compose an AR visualization that will enhance the surgical
view of the brain, and (iii) validate and evaluate our technology in real clinical settings. The rationale for this
project is that such technology will provide a clear and interpretable visualization tool to surgeons that will
support their decision-making process and reduce the time and complex spatial reasoning required to treat
cerebrovascular malformations. To attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims will be
pursued: 1) develop and validate a method to classify artery and veins in DSA image series to visually
disentangle AVMs, 2) develop and validate a method to build dynamic, virtual 3D model of cerebral vasculature
from pairs of DSA image series and 3) build an AR visualization that aligns DSA image series with the surgical
view and assess its impact providing surgical guidance. In addition, we will examine, through a clinical
retrospective study, and through tests in the operating room on phantom data, the impact of this visualization in
providing surgeons with guidance during cerebrovascular surgery. The proposed project is innovative because
it will be possible to merge the true DSA-derived 3D cerebral hemodynamics with images of the brain surface
seen through a surgical microscope. The proposed project is significant because it will provide visual guidance
and confirmation to surgeons that will facilitate decision-making in the surgical treatment of complex AVMs.
The results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide novel neuronavigation
tools to improve the surgical treatment of cerebrovascular malformations and ultimately reduce the risks of
intraoperative hemorrhaging and postsurgical deficits. Furthermore, the methods described here are
cost-effective, adapted to low-resources settings, and can be easily implemented on a large scale, bringing
advanced imaging techniques to far more patients."
10788371,"SUMMARY: Cannabis use in the U.S. has been dramatically increasing from 8.9% in 2016, to 17.5% in 2019,
of U.S. citizens (age 12+) having used Cannabis in the last year. As Cannabis use increases, it is critical that we
understand the biological activity of unwanted effects such as hypolocomotion that inhibit a patient’s ability to
move and function normally. ∆9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in THC, acts
as a partial agonist at the endocannabinoid (eCB) receptor, CB1R, to induce motor impairments in mice such as
hypolocomotion and catalepsy. Beyond this, the neural-circuit basis of hypolocomotive responses to THC, and
other CB1R agonists, remains largely unexplored. Using a novel eCB sensor GRAB-eCB2.0, in the prelimbic
cortex (PrL), we observed a correlation between spontaneous movement events and eCB activity transients.
These eCB transients, and replicated GCaMP6f calcium transients, are time-locked to the initiation of movement
and were significantly greater in THC-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that THC activates CB1R’s on select PrL GABAergic interneuron subpopulations, which
disinhibits the glutamatergic activity within the PrL to modulate spontaneous movement. Aim 1 will determine if
select GABAergic subpopulations modulate THC dependent PrL-mediated spontaneous movement. I will utilize
in situ hybridization to probe differential expression patterns of GABAergic interneurons (GABA-IN’s). Combining
GABA-IN-Cre lines with viral techniques and optogenetic electrophysiology, I will investigate the physiological
changes induced by THC. We will measure THC-dependent changes in IPSCs as well as use cutting-edge
techniques to probe the cannabinoid-dependent depolarized suppression of excitation/inhibition (DSE/DSI) in
layers 2/3 to layers 5/6 contralaterally. Aim 2 will utilize fiber photometry of GABA-IN-Cre and VGLUT-Cre
animals expressing cre-dependent GCaMP6f or eCB2.0 to record the specific neuronal activity and eCB levels
of inhibitory and excitatory neurons during spontaneous movement of mice treated with THC and/or one of a
series of pharmacological agents. We will also virally express a CRISPR-CB1R construct to eliminate CB1R from
GABA-IN’s and glutamatergic neurons to determine if THC is able to produce the same changes in neuronal
activity. We hypothesize that select subpopulations of GABA-IN’s mediate the THC-dependent increase in PrL
activity associated with spontaneous movement. To determine the sufficiency of PrL activity in THC treated mice,
GABA-IN’s and glutamatergic neurons will be optogenetically stimulated or inhibited to mediate movement. The
goal of this proposal is to train me to become an independent investigator focused on the neuropharmacology
of neuromodulation, leveraging training in novel approaches to decipher the mechanisms by which THC
modulates prelimbic cortical activity during movement while inducing robust hypolocomotion."
10788373,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Rises in cocaine misuse and cocaine overdose deaths over the last decade illustrate the lack of therapeutic
interventions for individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD). With abstinence as the only treatment for cocaine
cravings, a majority of individuals with CUD are vulnerable to relapse. The development of novel CUD
therapeutics relies on a thorough understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive cocaine craving and
relapse. Cocaine causes molecular adaptations within distinct neuronal subpopulations that leads to circuit-
specific changes in neural activity. A critical node of the reward circuit is the ventral pallidum (VP), as it receives
input from and projects to several regions that mediate cocaine-seeking behaviors. Activity from VP afferents to
the ventral tegmental area (VTA-projecting VP neurons) is required for cocaine relapse; however, the cellular
and molecular adaptations that occur within VTA-projecting VP neurons to promote cocaine-seeking, are
unknown. To better understand the pathology of CUD, this proposal will investigate how changes in
neuronal activity and gene expression within VTA-projecting VP neurons occur within cue-induced
reinstatement to cocaine-seeking. Using cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA) and chemogenetics
in mice, my preliminary data replicates a previous finding in rats that VTA-projecting VP neurons are required for
reinstatement of cocaine-seeking. In this proposal, I will employ IVSA, cutting-edge in vivo biosensors,
chemogenetics and molecular techniques to investigate the circuit-specific changes in VP neuronal activity and
gene expression that occur during reinstatement to cocaine-seeking. I hypothesize that cocaine engages VTA-
projecting VP neurons, leading to cocaine cue-induced 1) enhancement of VTA-projecting VP neuronal activity
and 2) increases in synaptic gene expression that accompany drug-seeking and relapse. In Specific Aim 1, I will
use fiber photometry to assess how cocaine-associated cues affected patterned calcium activity within VTA-
projecting VP neurons during cue-induced reinstatement. I will also examine how chemogenetic inhibition of
VTA-projecting VP neurons impacts changes in VTA-projecting VP calcium activity following the presentation of
cocaine-associated cues. In Specific Aim 2, I will perform ribosomal immunoprecipitation with RNA-Sequencing
to determine whether increases in synaptic gene expression within VTA-projecting VP neurons occurs following
reinstatement to cocaine-seeking. Further, I will examine whether inhibiting VTA-projecting VP neuronal activity
prevents reinstatement-induced changes in gene expression using chemogenetics and RNAScope. Together,
these experiments will identify novel mechanisms within VTA-projecting VP neurons neurons that mediate
reinstatement to cocaine-seeking. This proposal will also provide me with strong training in new research areas
that will support my independent career path in science."
10788374,"Abstract:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in December 2019 and has since led to an unprecedented global pandemic
with high morbidity and mortality.
Current authorized vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated 70 – 95% efficacy in clinical trials, but the
pivotal efficacy trials on which the emergency use authorizations are based did not include pregnant women.
Thus, in the midst of a massive vaccination campaign, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women
and their infants is unknown. Pregnant women are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization,
but currently there is no strong recommendation for or against COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Additionally, COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant women and factors associated with being vaccinated
or unvaccinated are unknown.
We propose to 1) estimate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
infection or COVID-19 hospitalization in pregnant women, 2) determine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination
during pregnancy in preventing COVID-19 infection or hospitalization among infants during the first year of life;
and determine whether effectiveness varies by trimester of vaccination and 3) estimate COVID-19 vaccination
rates among pregnant women over time and among unvaccinated pregnant women, identify
sociodemographic, geographic clusters and healthcare utilization patterns associated with being unvaccinated.
We are well-positioned at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated healthcare system with
stable, diverse membership and comprehensive longitudinal electronic health records (EHR), to address the
research aims. By using EHR data, the study will be cost effective and timely; providing information on COVID-
19 vaccine effectiveness among pregnant women and assessing whether maternal vaccination provides
protection for their infants who are currently ineligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine.
The proposed research can lead to evidence-based recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccination in
pregnant women and will provide critical information regarding characteristics of unvaccinated pregnant
women that will be necessary for future development of targeted interventions to improve vaccine coverage
among pregnant women."
10788375,"Although smoking prevalence has decreased, more than 34 million Americans continue to smoke. Disenfranchised groups increasingly comprise the remaining smoking population, and cigarette relighters may be some of the most disenfranchised (e.g., low socioeconomic status). Relighting refers to extinguishing, saving, and later relighting unfinished cigarettes. Research suggests this is a prevalent behavior engaged in by 44-73% of smokers, with 17-21% of smokers reporting they relight ‘usually’ or ‘frequently’, thus impacting millions of Americans. Apparent reasons for relighting include cost, perceived benefits for health and cessation, and smoking bans. This behavior may increase harms to smokers such as lung cancer and chronic bronchitis. For example, relighting could contribute to worse cessation and health outcomes if relighters (who tend to be highly nicotine-dependent) have lower motivation toward total abstinence because they believe they are minimizing the amount they smoke. They may also be inadequately treated and advised by clinicians because they appear to be less dependent or smoke fewer numbers of cigarettes per day (CPD) compared to non-relighters, despite a greater number of smoking sessions per day and exposure to toxicants. This could lead to under-dosing of pharmacotherapy. Given that reasons for relighting include the increasing cost of cigarettes, prevalence of relighting may grow in the future (especially during this economic crisis) and may continue to impact disproportionately those with greater existing tobacco-related disparities. More research is needed to address these challenges by investigating who relights and why, and potential effects of relighting on tobacco dependence, cessation, and health. Understanding relighting is critical because: 1) current assessments (i.e., CPD) may underestimate toxicant exposure and nicotine dependence among relighters and 2) if relighting continues to be largely ignored by providers, a high proportion of smokers may be undertreated. Specific aims of this four-year project are to: 1) Establish criteria and reasons for, as well as prevalence, frequency, and correlates of relighting in a national survey; 2) Evaluate potential toxic effects of relighting using topography and toxicant analyses; 3) Investigate the potential impact of relighting by observing tobacco treatment and outcomes of relighters in a state-wide tobacco treatment program. Preliminary studies need to be replicated and extended to be more rigorous, comprehensive, and on a larger scale to address numerous remaining questions that would lay the groundwork for understanding the individual and public health impact of relighting. This study will provide important information about the extent, frequency, contextual factors, and potential dangers of this understudied behavior. The study has implications for both surveillance and treatment such as new measures to screen for relighting clinically and in population surveys as well as potentially informing clinicians in prescribing appropriate-intensity treatments for relighters. Together, data from the proposed specific aims will provide a clearer picture of the extent and impact of cigarette relighting."
10784498,"The brain has two strategies for behavioral control. Goal-directed actions that rely on prospective
consideration of their outcomes and consequences, and habits, reflexive responses performed without
forethought of their consequences. Overreliance on habit contributes to maladaptive perseverative behavior,
which characterizes numerous psychiatric conditions, including autism. Environmental factors, like chronic
stress, and genetic alteration, can tip the balance between actions and habits. However, our knowledge of the
brain mechanisms by which these factors influence habits is lacking, limiting our understanding of maladaptive
behaviors in psychiatric conditions, and how to treat them effectively. Therefore, the broad goal of my research
is to reveal specific neuronal mechanisms that allow genes and the environment to modulate behavioral control.
 Accumulating evidence suggests the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is central for controlling goal-directed
actions. Inhibition of the DMS, particularly Drd1+ direct pathway neurons, disrupts goal-directed control, resulting
in a bias toward habits. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a known hub for stress-responsivity in the brain and
projects onto DMS Drd1+ neurons. My postdoctoral work has revealed that BLA-DMS activity supports goal-
directed learning and is suppressed after chronic stress exposure. Further, I found that activation of BLA-DMS
projections in stressed animals is sufficient to restore goal-directed control. This led me to the intriguing
hypothesis that chronic stress dysregulates DMS Drd1+ control of goal-directed learning via BLA-DMS input.
Through the proposed research, I will reveal how chronic stress changes the DMS Drd1+ neuronal activity
associated with goal-directed learning, at the population and single-cell levels, and how BLA input facilitates this.
I will accomplish this using cellular resolution in vivo calcium imaging with miniscopes, combined with projection-
specific chemogenetic manipulation, in mice (Aim 1; K99). In my independent phase, I will apply these techniques
to a mouse model of 16p11.2 microdeletion, a genetic alteration associated with autism and that is known to
dysregulate striatal function. Specifically, I will examine the vulnerability to premature habits of 16p11.2 mice,
normally and after stress, and assess amygdala-striatal control, using cell-type specific in vivo calcium imaging
with miniscopes, slice electrophysiology, and projection-specific optogenetic manipulations (Aim 2; R00). My
findings will provide a mechanistic understanding of habitual control normally, after stress, and in a model of
autism-associated genetic alteration. This will facilitate future work into the molecular and cellular mechanisms
of this phenomenon and ultimately serve my goal of improving treatment approaches for psychiatric conditions.
 I will conduct my K99 training in the Wassum Lab at UCLA, with the guidance of a remarkable mentoring
team that has pioneered the open source miniscope technology. This environment will provide me with the
necessary intellectual and technical training I need to launch my independent research program studying the
mechanisms that allow environmental and genetic factors to modulate behavioral control strategies."
10784501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by high levels of inflammatory markers
and multi-organ damage. Despite standard treatment, sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in critically ill patients, especially cancer patients. Recently, it has been shown that
acupuncture can induce dopamine production, suppress inflammation, and reduce sepsis in animal
studies. Several randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that acupuncture may reduce
mortality in sepsis patients. However the trials were unblinded and at risk for bias. Here we propose
to fill the knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled, patient and evaluator blinded, phase
2 trial of acupuncture (the ACTIONS trial), using sham acupuncture as control, in patients at risk for
sepsis. The specific Aims are: 1) to generate preliminary data for the estimated effect size of
acupuncture in reducing mortality and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission of sepsis patients and to
determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture in hospitalized
patients who are at risk for sepsis; and 2) to explore whether acupuncture increases catecholamines
and reduces inflammatory cytokines more than sham acupuncture. Seventy-eight patients at risk for
sepsis, will be randomized to true or sham acupuncture daily for 10 days or until transfer to ICU,
death, or discharge. Feasibility endpoints include as accrual rate, intervention delivery rate, attrition
rate, and data completion rate. Efficacy endpoints include mortality and rate of ICU admission.
Biomarker endpoints are plasma levels of catecholamines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, measured
before and after the first acupuncture treatment. If this study shows that acupuncture is deemed
feasible and the estimated effect size warrant a larger study, we plan to conduct a randomized
controlled phase 3 study evaluate the definitive efficacy of acupuncture in improving outcomes of
sepsis patients. The proposed study would be the first one acupuncture study on sepsis using sham
acupuncture as control. The data will also shed light on the mechanism of action of acupuncture. This
project has the potential of developing acupuncture as an innovative clinical approach in the
management of sepsis. It challenges the current clinical practice paradigm and can lead to reduction
of deaths due to sepsis."
10759373,"Summary/Abstract
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that park within the non-lymphoid tissue provide superior immunity
against a variety of pathogens including influenza virus infection. The mechanisms regulating CD8 TRM
maintenance, heterogeneity, protective and pathological functions are incompletely understood. Our recent
data have identified a novel protective CD8 TRM population that co-exhibits both exhausted and
conventional memory CD8 T cell features following acute influenza infection. Unlike the conventional
circulating memory CD8 T cells that are maintained in a MHC-I independent way, the survival and
maintenance of these PD-1hi TRM cells require persistent MHC-I and TCR signaling. Based on these prelim
data, we propose to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which these PD-1hi TRM are maintained in
the lung. We hypothesize the intrinsic CD28 and PD-1 signaling, specifically in lung-resident CD8 T cells,
balances the maintenance, protective function and fibrogenic activities of these PD-1hi TRM following influenza
virus infection (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that the expression of the transcription factor
Klf10 in CD8 T cells is vital for the maintenance and the function of these PD-1hi TRM (Aim 2). In addition, we
will determine whether it is possible to uncouple the pathogenic activities from the protective function of TRM, so
we may specifically provoke the protective function, but not the pathogenic activities of TRM for future vaccine
design and/or immunotherapies (Aim 3).
Relevance statement
Each year, influenza virus infects 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children, killing as many as 500,000 people
globally. In addition to the acute morbidity and mortality, it is increasingly appreciated that influenza virus
infection could lead to the development of chronic lung conditions including pulmonary fibrotic responses.
Currently, little is known about the etiology of the development of chronic lung sequelae following influenza
virus infection. The successful completion of this study will provide insights for developing interventions to
promote the complete recovery of the tissue while minimizing the development of chronic lung conditions
following acute respiratory viral infections. Furthermore, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms
regulating the maintenance of lung protective TRM responses following influenza infection and/or immunization
may aid the design of future influenza therapeutics and influenza vaccines."
10759377,"For patients and their intimate partners, advanced cancer poses significant physical and
emotional challenges that can negatively impact both the individuals and the couple. Couples’
ability to communicate openly and effectively with each other about cancer-related concerns can
improve their psychological adjustment and the quality of their relationship. It may also lead to
better symptom management and goal-concordant care for the patient. However, many couples
report difficulties communicating about cancer, even in the context of overall satisfying
relationships. Prior research has found that couple-based interventions that target
communication lead to positive outcomes for cancer patients and their partners. However, most
have been limited by an in-person treatment delivery format that precludes many couples from
participating; they have also not targeted interventions to couples most at risk for poor
outcomes. To address these limitations, the proposed study will conduct an RCT to test the
efficacy of a Couples Communication Skills Training (CCST) intervention delivered via
videoconference for couples facing advanced cancer. The intervention will be targeted to
couples who report high levels of holding back from discussing cancer-related concerns, a
variable associated with poorer psychological and relationship functioning. The CCST
intervention includes components to assist couples communicate effectively, decrease
avoidance of important cancer-related issues, and provide each other with support. In the
proposed study, 230 patients with advanced GI, GU, breast, or lung cancer and their partners
will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) CCST, or 2) Education. All participants
will be provided with tablet computers with internet access for videoconferencing. Assessments,
including self-report measures and audio recorded couple conversations, will be conducted with
patients and partners at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Self-report measures will
also be collected at 3 months follow up. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that patients and
partners in the CCST intervention will report significantly higher levels of relationship satisfaction
and intimacy relative to those in the education condition. Secondary aims will focus on (a)
improvements in patient and partner psychological adjustment; (b) improvements in patient
health and health care outcomes; and (c) whether improvements in individual and relationship
functioning are mediated by improvements in self-reported and objective measures of
communication. Exploratory analyses include (a) examination of moderators of intervention
effects, and (b) an implementation-related process evaluation of the intervention guided by the
RE-AIM framework to expedite translation of the intervention into clinical practice."
10758950,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is a significant cause of death in the US and is
frequently followed by infection and sepsis. As a result, many patients suffering from HS or HS+sepsis
develop acute lung injury (ALI), a life-threatening complication. We have previously discovered that eCIRP,
a new DAMP, released after HS or sepsis worsens disease severity and lethality. Our preliminary studies
have confirmed elevated levels of eCIRP in the circulation of patients and animals after HS, as well as in the
supernatant of macrophages exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). We have also shown that H/R or
endotoxin promotes gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage into pore-forming subunits. The release of eCIRP
after endotoxin was decreased by a GSDMD pore formation inhibitor and in cells from GSDMD knockout
mice, implicating an important role of GSDMD in eCIRP’s active release. We have demonstrated that
eCIRP activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in vitro and in vivo, leading to the upregulation and
release of type I interferons (IFNs). Furthermore, we have shown that STING activation is critical to the
development of systemic inflammation, tissue injury, ALI, and mortality after HS. We have also
demonstrated that eCIRP promotes mitochondrial (mt) DNA fragmentation, thus providing a plausible
mechanism for how eCIRP activates STING. In addition, we have shown for the first time that type I IFNs
play a pivotal role in the development of ALI after HS. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that
eCIRP, released through GSDMD pores, activates STING via fragmented mtDNA and increases the release
of type I IFNs, ultimately leading to ALI and death after HS or HS+sepsis. Moreover, we have predicted in
silico and confirmed in vitro that our newly discovered RNA mimic A12 binds to eCIRP with high affinity, in-
hibiting eCIRP’s ability to induce TNFα release from macrophages. A12 had a long half-life in the circulation
and reduced inflammation and tissue injury after HS. Therefore, we further hypothesize that eCIRP
inhibition with A12 attenuates ALI and mortality in mice subjected to HS or HS+sepsis. In this project, we
plan to establish the role of GSDMD pore formation on the active release of eCIRP, determine the detailed
mechanism by which eCIRP activates STING, and examine the beneficial effects of the novel eCIRP
inhibitor A12 on ALI and survival after HS or HS+sepsis. These studies shall provide novel mechanistic
insights into the pathogenesis of ALI and organ injury after HS or HS complicated by sepsis, as well as a
new potential therapeutic strategy to treat patients under those conditions."

The past four decades, have witnessed a significant increase in public health and clinical research being
conducted in Mali, driven partly by increasing international research collaborations and the recent Ebola
epidemic. This increase in human research, creates an urgent need for improved bioethics leadership, training,
policy and research. It is, therefore, critical and timely to ensure that researchers and members of institutional
review board (IRB) in Mali have the requisite knowledge, and capacity to ensure the research meets ethical,
cultural, and regulatory expectations. To meet the ethics training needs of Mali, we propose a research ethics
capacity building program to strengthen research ethics education and research in Mali through an innovative
model of sustainable capacity development to prepare the next generation of ethics researchers. This program
will be based on close collaboration between two institutions – the George Washington University Milken Institute
School of Public Health (GWU), USA and University of Science, Techniques & Technologies of Bamako
(USTTB), Mali. The overall goal of the United States-Mali Research Ethics Training Program (US-Mali
RETP) is to strengthen research ethics education and research in Mali. Our model will focus on using US and
Africa-based expertise to strengthen USTTB’s capacity to develop and lead a new Master’s degree specialization
in research ethics and promote a sustainable bioethics enterprise at USTTB through the following specific aims;
Specific Aim 1: To enhance the pedagogical and curricular strengths of key USTTB faculty to deliver
research ethics courses and mentoring in Mali. We will implement a faculty development program for
selected Malian faculty aimed at enhancing analytical capacity in ethics research and training. The selected
Malian faculty will participate in intensive courses in US, work with GWSPH faculty in developing curricula and
co-delivery of ethics curriculum during year 2. Specific Aim 2: To develop a research ethics specialization
within the existing USTTB Masters of Public Health (MPH) program in order to train a core group of
professionals with expertise in research ethics in Mali. We will develop a new curriculum in research ethics
within the MPH program at USTTB. The Ethics modules will also be offered as part of a one year Diplome. We
will also offer short term training workshops and webinars at USTTB including both basic and advanced topics
each year. Specific Aim 3: To promote research around key priorities for research ethics in Mali. We will
through our trainees conduct relevant national research on ethics to inform public health, training priorities and
health care delivery including ethics of research on infectious and emerging diseases as well as genetics and
genomics. Specific Aim 4: To create a dedicated “Research Ethics Unit” within USTTB in Mali. We will
work to establish an academic Research Unit within USTTB which will coordinate Bioethics research and
activities at USTTB and enhance sustainability of our efforts. This unit will also coordinate a national forum to
discuss research ethics in Mali in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mali."

prolonged seizures, free Zn2+ accumulates in neurons and observations that Zn2+ chelation is protective
implicates a role in neuronal death. Culture studies have revealed that exogenously applied Zn2+ can enter
neurons and accumulate in mitochondria, powerfully disrupting their function. However, little is known about
mechanisms of injury caused by the accumulation of endogenous Zn2+ in native brain tissues.
 Using acute hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) to model ischemia, we
recently made the first simultaneous measurements of cytosolic Zn2+ and Ca2+ changes, and found that Zn2+
accumulation is an early event in hippocampal pyramidal neurons that precedes and contributes to a subsequent
sharp and terminal Ca2+ deregulation event, causatively linked to loss of membrane integrity. We have further
found that the acute deleterious effects of Zn2+ seem to result specifically from its uptake into mitochondria via
the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). In ongoing slice studies, we find evidence for major differences between
sources of the Zn2+ that accumulates in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons contributing to acute
OGD induced damage, with considerable Zn2+ accumulation in mitochondria of CA1 but not of CA3 neurons at
delayed time points after a sublethal episode of OGD. These differences in Zn2+ contributions may bear upon
the differential vulnerabilities of CA1 vs CA3 neurons in disease conditions, with CA1 preferentially degenerating
after transient global ischemia, and CA3 after recurrent limbic seizures.
 This proposal continues ongoing studies, generally organized around a Hypothesis: Mitochondrial Zn2+
accumulation is an early event after transient ischemia, which causes disruption of mitochondrial function and
contributes to delayed cell death. Aim I applies imaging techniques to acute hippocampal slices to further clarify
mitochondrial effects of Zn2+ in hippocampal neurons in the hours after transient oxygen glucose deprivation (as
a model of ischemia), and to study events occurring after restoration of O2/glucose (“reperfusion”) that may be
amenable to beneficial therapeutic interventions. Aim II seeks to make initial test of principle studies of our
hypothesis in an in vivo rat global ischemia model.
 These studies will provide mechanistic insights that will aid the development of new and effective therapeutic
interventions to be delivered after an episode of transient ischemia, that will disrupt the pathological cascade,
enabling improved outcomes."

 Diarrheal diseases account for 1 in 10 child deaths worldwide. Rotavirus (RV) and enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli (ETEC) are major etiological causes of acute gastroenteritis and severe diarrhea worldwide,
together resulting in approximately 300,000 deaths each year, mostly in children under the age of five. Current
RV vaccines have limited efficacy in endemic countries and no direct antivirals are available. No vaccine is
licensed for ETEC. Our overall objectives are to better understand the biology of RV and ETEC and to use that
information to develop therapeutic interventions to alleviate diarrhea and sequelae.
 In preliminary studies, we utilized an improved RV reverse genetics system developed by our lab and
generated a recombinant murine RV that encodes the protruding domain of the human norovirus VP1 protein.
We found that this RV-based viral vector induces a robust antigen-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA responses
in inoculated mouse pups. Based on these data, we constructed several new recombinant RVs that express
ETEC heat-labile and heat-stable toxins. We hypothesize that one or more novel RV-ETEC dual vaccine
candidates will induce a protective humoral immune response in mice and reduce pathogen burden
and pathogenesis from subsequent RV and ETEC infections.
 To test this hypothesis, we have developed a highly tractable murine RV reverse genetics method, disease
relevant neonatal and adult mouse models, and several innovative primary human small bowel organoid
cultures, which will provide an unprecedented resolution of understanding of the immunogenicity and protective
efficacy of our vaccine candidates. In Aim 1, we will characterize RV replication and define the immunological
responses of our dual vaccines in neonatal mice. In Aim 2, we will examine the efficacy of the recombinant RV-
ETEC dual vaccines in protecting immunized mice from RV and ETEC challenges in adult mice. Collectively,
we expect our proof-of-principle study to start to establish the utility of RVs as an innovative live-attenuated
mucosal vaccine platform to encode foreign antigens and broadly protect against common enteric pathogens."

The CTSA Postdoctoral T32 at Indiana University will create and retain a diverse trainee workforce, by
integrating mentor/mentee training with special emphasis on resiliency and how mentor/mentee backgrounds
and experiences influence these interactions. We will engage our trainees in vertical mentoring and near-peer
mentoring by utilizing our pipeline programs to foster our trainees' mentoring skills and create lasting
connections to foster resiliency and improve retention in STEM across our training cohorts. Program
evaluations will include robust feedback mechanisms through which training experiences can be optimized for
each trainee. Key elements in the development of mentee/mentor relationships will be the implementation of
both IDPs and the AAMC mentor-mentee compacts, these will set the expectations for open communication
and form the basis of our yearly evaluation of the growth in their mentored relationship. We will foster mentee
training in responsible conduct of research and rigorous approaches to biomedical research as initial steps to
building the knowledge base and competent skill sets that lead to scientific integrity and trustworthiness. We
will create and provide training in critical communication skills that focus on building trust between mentors and
mentees, as well as with those in the community with whom they engage. Our training plan will specifically
leverage the individual trainee's domain expertise, as well as the broad cross-institutional strengths within the
Indiana CTSI to expand their core knowledge, which will facilitate the translation of their research project as
they are further trained in translational science. Through this training our trainees will be able to implement
principles of team research and process innovation as key elements in their research program. By utilizing the
broad scope of translational programs available at Indiana University, Purdue University and the University of

Older adults face some of life’s most complex and influential decisions, just as cognitive, social, and other
resources decline. Poor decision making, particularly in financial and health matters, poses enormous public
health and economic challenges. Financial fraud offers an alarming example; older adults are among the most
vulnerable and lose >$35 billion to fraud annually. The reasons why remain unclear, however, as decision
making is a relatively nascent focus of aging research. In 2010, we began a study of decision making in the
Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of aging. In the first two
cycles, we enrolled >1,300 older adults, all of whom undergo detailed annual assessments of financial and
health decision making. We reported that decision making involves a complex interplay among diverse
resources and that many older adults—including those who are cognitively intact—exhibit poor decision
making and are highly susceptible to scams. We also reported that poor decision making is associated with an
increased risk of adverse outcomes including dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, in
compelling preliminary studies, we found that neuroimaging and neuropathologic markers of brain aging and
Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (AD/ADRDs) degrade decision making. Thus, poor decision making
is a harbinger of adverse health outcomes and may be due in part to age-related alterations in neural integrity.
The overall goal of the proposed continuation (R01AG033678) is to identify the risk factors,
consequences, and neurobiologic bases of age-related change in decision making. Continued annual
data collection is necessary to precisely quantify age-related change in financial and health decision making.
We will identify risk factors for decline independent of cognition and examine important health and financial
impacts including financial exploitation and strain, outcomes we will newly measure. We also will newly
incorporate in vivo neuroimaging to expand our focus on the neural basis of age-related change in decision
making and complement clinical-pathologic findings. This study offers an unprecedented opportunity to link
longitudinal decision making, behavioral, and adverse outcome data with neuroimaging and neuropathologic
markers of neural integrity and AD/ADRDs. This integrative approach will efficiently determine the risk factors,
consequences, and neurobiologic bases of age-related change in decision making and identify modifiable
targets to improve decision making, health, and financial outcomes in old age."

The mouse zinc finger proteins ZFY1 and ZFY2 are essential for male fertility. Although human ZFY’s reproductive role has
not yet been determined, the Y-derived Zfy transgenes improve spermatogenesis when added to mouse models with
limited Y chromosome contribution. Specifically, Zfy (1) reinstates quality control checkpoints during the pachytene stage
and metaphase I of meiosis, (2) promotes the second meiotic division and production of haploid round spermatid, and (3)
improves spermiogenesis and assisted reproduction outcome. Nakasuji et al. and the Ward Lab recently produced Zfy1/2
double knock-out (DKO) mice, with both groups observing a complete loss of fertility and severe defects in
spermatogenesis. The mechanism by which the homologues contribute to male fertility remains unknown but based on
its predicted protein sequence and in vitro assays in human cultured cells ZFY is widely believed to be a transcription
factor. Transcriptome and proteome analyses of germ cells from Zfy1/2 DKO mice will help identify which genes are
regulated by ZFY1 and ZFY2, and the biochemical function of both proteins can be determined by antibody-based assays
such as immunoprecipitation (IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The proposed project will investigate the
molecular function of ZFY, with the hypothesis that ZFY1 and ZFY2 contribute to spermatogenesis and male fertility by
regulating the expression of a cascade of reproduction-related genes. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims.
In Specific Aim 1, we will perform transcriptome and proteome analyses of primary spermatocytes (ps), secondary
spermatocytes (ss), and round spermatid (rs) from Zfy1/2 DKO males to determine which genes are dysregulated in the
absence of ZFY. This will involve isolating Zfy1/2 DKO germ cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), extracting
RNA and protein from each cell type, and then performing RNA-seq and mass spectrometry (MS). Potential downstream
candidates of ZFY1 and ZFY2 will then be identified from the genes dysregulated in DKO mice. In Specific Aim 2, antibody-
based assays will be performed to discover the biochemical function of ZFY1 and ZFY2 in the mouse testis. This will require
first generating a method to detect ZFY1 and ZFY2 proteins. Thus, in Aim 2.1, zygotes will be targeted with CRISPR/Cas9
technology to create knock-in (KI) mouse models, independently for each homologue, in which targeted ZFY will have a C-
terminal HA tag (XYZfy1-HA and XYZfy2-HA). In Aim 2.2, we will confirm that we can specifically recognize ZFY1 and ZFY2
proteins, as well as any potential binding partners, with immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography followed by
tandem mass spectrometry (IP/LC/MS). Finally, in Aim 2.3, purified spermatogenic cells from the KI mice will be used for
ChIP-PCR to determine whether ZFY1 and ZFY2 regulate expression of selected downstream candidates identified in
Specific Aim 1. Additionally, ChIP-seq will be done to identify ZFY1 and ZFY2 targets genome-wide. The proposed project
will advance understanding of the function of two known fertility factors, ZFY1 and ZFY2, in mice. It may lead to
identification of new fertility genes among targets of ZFY homologues, which could in turn inform our knowledge on the
homologous human ZFY isoform."
10749477,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most Veteran-centric conditions with few interventions
with sufficient evidence and is a top research priority for the VA. The 2021 VA-DOD guidelines recommend a
non-pharmacologic approach to manage symptoms and avoid medications, which Veterans also prefer.
Significance. As a part of VA’s cutting-edge Whole Health approach to healthcare, the VA has embraced
Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) as a major tool for non-pharmacologic approaches and has
approved several CIH approaches including acupuncture, biofeedback, clinical hypnosis, meditation, and yoga
for either treatment or well-being. However, the VA-DOD TBI guideline has determined that there is insufficient
evidence to recommend CIH approaches for TBI. Generating new evidence that will ultimately improve the
quality and outcomes of care of Veterans with TBI is the primary objective of this proposal. Because patients
with TBI often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we will specifically examine the effectiveness
of CIH in Veterans with both TBI and PTSD.
Innovation and Impact. This proposal is innovative in that it capitalizes on the unique VA data on CIH and TBI
and make VA data work for Veterans. Being organized according to the learning health system paradigm, our
Aim 1 will be rooted in current clinical practice and seek the insights from stakeholders. Aim 2 will utilize state-
of-the-art statistical methods, and Aim 3 will leverage novel AI and AI explanation methods developed by our
team. The proposed study will support the implementation of VA’s cutting-edge Whole Health approach by
providing clinicians and Veterans with the much-needed sufficient evidence about the role of CIH in TBI.
Specific Aims. Our Specific Aims are (1) To understand the perspectives of Veterans with TBI (with and
without PTSD), clinicians, and administrators about the barriers and facilitators in providing CIH care to
Veterans with TBI and strategies to enhance the well-being of Veterans with TBI via CIH approaches, through
focus groups and interviews. (2) To test the hypothesis that initiation of VA-approved CIH approaches is
associated with a lower risk of combined endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization in Veterans
with TBI, overall and stratified by PTSD, using new-user design and propensity score approaches. (3) Aim 3:
To assess the impact of individual CIH approaches in individual Veterans with TBI, with or without PTSD, on
the risk of combined endpoint of death or hospitalization, by developing explainable deep machine learning
prediction models. The deep learning analyses will be able to account for complex treatment patterns including
the duration, sequence, and combination of different modalities.
Next Steps/Implementation. In addition to presentations and publications, the study findings will be
disseminated and implemented locally as well as nationally through collaboration and sponsorship of
operational partners including leadership at the Washington DC VAMC, VA National AI Center, VA Office of
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and VA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation."
10749478,"Background: Low-value medical services are common and costly. Veterans often receive services that offer
little or no clinical benefit while generating costs and unnecessary risks. Gaps in research have hindered
effective policies to address low-value Veteran care. First, the causes of low-value service use are uncertain.
For example, through the VA Community Care program (VACC), Veterans are treated by non-VA clinicians
who face few incentives to avoid unnecessary tests and procedures. However, it is unclear whether VACC has
increased Veterans’ risk of receiving low-value services. Our research has shown an association between
greater use of VACC and increased rates of low-value care. Rigorous quasi-experimental research could
confirm whether this association is causal, guiding appropriate policy responses. Second, policies addressing
low-value care have been hindered by a lack of evidence on what constitutes low-value care and how to
translate evidence into effective clinical decision-making. To address these research gaps, first, I will test
whether VACC under Choice/MISSION has increased low-value care. Second, I will study strategies to
address low-value care via evidence development and evidence translation.
Significance/Impact: Addressing low-value health care use is of crucial importance to Veterans, aligning with
multiple dimensions of HSR&D priority domains including priority research areas (health care value, quality and
safety of health care), priority HSR methods (advancing HSR methods in areas that cut across conditions or
care settings), and priority policy/legislative areas (MISSION Act).
Innovation: This research applies innovative methods to novel research questions. The quantitative methods
have wide potential applications across VA HSR, though they have been rarely applied in this setting.
Specific Aims: This Career Development Award (CDA) would support the following research aims:
Aim 1 Quantify the effect of VACC under Choice/MISSION on Veterans’ low-value service use and spending.
Aim 2a Convene an expert panel to identify and prioritize “gray zone” services ideal for evidence development.
Aim 2b Conduct focus groups to identify barriers and facilitators to translating new evidence on service value
into high-value practices
Methodology: Aim 1: Using 33 measures of low-value services applied to national clinical data, we will test the
effect of outpatient VACC on low-value service use and spending. A regression discontinuity (RD) analysis will
examine a natural experiment that arose because VACC eligibility can differ for otherwise similar Veterans who
live slightly different distances from VA facilities. Machine learning covariate selection techniques will optimize
statistical power. Aim 2a: Via an expert consensus building process, clinicians, researchers and Veterans will
prioritize “gray zone” services, which have unclear value, for evidence development. Services will be prioritized
based on incidence among Veterans, expected costs/harms, and analytical tractability for RD analysis in VA
data. Aim 2b: We will conduct focus groups with clinical and health system leaders as well as Veterans;
drawing on a conceptual model of health care value, we will identify barriers and facilitators to translating new
evidence on low-value services into high-value practices. Complementary training aims in qualitative methods,
machine learning, and learning health system competencies will support the research aims.
Next Steps/Implementation: This work has the support of the VA Office of Analytics and Performance
Integration and VA Office of Community Care, operational partners whose efforts to detect and address low-
value care will be enhanced by this research. I will collaborate with the VA Office of Community Care to assess
how Aim 1 results will inform their efforts to discourage low-value care in VACC. I will submit one IIR proposal
evaluating VA efforts to employ utilization management strategies in VACC. I will submit a second IIR proposal
to quantify the value of high-priority gray zone services identified in Aim 2."

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) reside in tissues and act as sentinels to a variety of environmental cues from
nutrients, neuropeptides, microbiota to pathogens. They are heterogeneous populations with diverse functions
and developmental origins. We have previously suggested that in addition to the bone marrow, the thymus can
contribute to ILC pools in peripheral tissues based on findings that lung ILC2s contain rearranged T cell
receptor genes, likely due to the divergence of developing thymocytes into the ILC fate. Consistently, T cell
precursors from the thymus can differentiate into ILC2s in vitro. Single cell RNA sequencing studies detected
a heterogeneous population of ILC precursors in the blood, which is greatly diminished in athymic nude mice,
suggesting the involvement of the thymus. These cells possess CD3 proteins in the cytoplasm but not on the
surface, thus making intracellular CD3 (icCD3) a marker for thymus-derived ILCs. Indeed, icCD3+ ILC subsets
have been detected in the lung and small intestine. Interestingly, the production of icCD3+ ILC1s and to a
lesser extent, ILC3s depends on Tcrd but that of icCD3+ ILC2s does not. This prompted us to propose that ILC
differentiation in the thymus involves Tcrd-dependent and independent mechanisms. The purpose of this
application is to study how thymus-derived ILCs are generated and to investigate the functions of these cells.
There are three aims. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that developing T cells with non-productive TCR gene
rearrangement contributes to multipotent ILC precursors and immature γδ T cells gives rise to ILC1- or ILC3-
biased precursors after down-regulation of their TCRs. We will employ approaches such as in vitro
differentiation cultures and analyses of TCR gene rearrangement events. Aim2 will characterize icCD3+ ILCs
in the small intestine by examining the age-dependent differentiation of ILC1s and ILC2 in relationship to T cell
development and changes in gut microbiota, and by comparing the type 1 responses of icCD3+ ILC1s to those
of conventional ILC1s and NK cells as well as γδ T cells. Aim3 will investigate the interplay of type 2 and type
3 immune responses and compare the behaviors of icCD3+ ILC2s to their icCD3- counterparts. Taken together,
these studies may make conceptual advancement in developmental immunology and shed light on the
contribution of thymus-derived ILCs to age-related differences in immunity."

Axon degeneration is a conserved and tightly regulated process and is a driving force of later pathologies in
many neurodegenerative diseases. There is a lack of treatments for neurodegeneration that results from
disease, and axon degeneration is a target for early intervention and prevention. Elucidating the specific
mechanisms that initiate axon degeneration could assist in identifying ways to protect axons in disease and
ultimately treat neurodegeneration.
C. elegans Mitochondrial Trafficking Mutants (MTMs) have no axonal mitochondria, resulting in axon
degeneration. In preliminary experiments the applicant made a surprising discovery: inhibiting glycolysis in
MTMs suppresses axon degeneration. Following this finding the applicant showed that degrading the enzyme
responsible for lactate production rescues degeneration of axons, suggesting that lactate accumulation may
drive axon degeneration. However, the molecular mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. This
observation prompted the hypothesis that the product of glycolysis, lactate, accumulates in the absence of
mitochondria and by creating a more acidic axonal environment instigates degeneration.
Completion of this proposed work will elucidate the role of lactate and related metabolites on axon
degeneration (Aim 1). Further, it will shed light on the consequences of loss of axonal mitochondria for
neurons —a key feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, these experiments may identify novel
approaches for preventing morphological and functional axon degeneration (Aim 2).
Work proposed here will establish the role of lactate in axon degeneration and further our understanding of the
coupling between neuronal activity and lactate in health and disease.
Upon completion of this fellowship the trainee will have received extensive training in an environment well
equipped to support collaborative and cutting-edge research. The trainee will gain technical and analytical
skills, and professional independence in preparation for an academic career in cellular and molecular
neuroscience."

Patients with lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are currently treated with agents targeting
androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, AR inhibition has not dramatically improved CRPC patient survival,
underscoring the need to discover novel oncogenic mechanisms in CRPC and develop new therapies targeting
these mechanisms. Cancer cells are addicted to aberrant RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, which includes
initiation, elongation, and termination phases, as well as a recycling step critical to repeated Pol II transcription
of the same gene after the initial transcription cycle. While studies have already indicated that uncontrolled
transcriptional initiation and elongation have oncogenic roles, it is unknown whether other Pol II transcription
processes contribute to cancer-relevant transcriptional outcomes and cancer growth. In preliminary studies, our
newly developed in vitro and cell-based transcription recycling assays have found that Pol II recycling is a key
yet overlooked transcription process with relevance to prostate cancer. We have found that Mediator complex
subunit 31 (MED31) drives Pol II recycling in CRPC cells, enhancing mRNA output during the recycling process.
Importantly, high expression of MED31 is both sufficient and necessary for prostate cancer castration-resistant
growth and is associated with poor prognosis of CRPC patients. While these findings identify the oncogenic
MED31 as a new therapeutic target for CRPC, transcription regulators such as MED31 are generally considered
untargetable by traditional, small molecule-based drug design. We have developed a safe lipid nanoparticle
(LNP) system for targeted delivery of the CRISPR/Cas13d system to efficiently and specifically knock down
oncogenic transcription regulators at the mRNA level. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that the
LNP-Cas13d system effectively and safely knocks down MED31 mRNA and decreases CRPC cell growth in vivo,
establishing the proof of the concept that the therapeutic window exists for targeting MED31 in CRPC. Together,
our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that MED31-governed transcription recycling is a novel
oncogenic driver for CRPC progression and that an LNP-Cas13d-based RNA targeting system can counteract
oncogenic transcription driven by MED31 in CRPC with safety, specificity, and efficacy. In Aim 1, we will delineate
the molecular mechanism, biological function, and clinical relevance of MED31-mediated transcription recycling.
In Aim 2, we will target MED31-mediated transcription recycling using a CRISPR/Cas13d-based nanoparticle
system. The successful completion of these aims will significantly elucidate the critical role of Pol II recycling in
lethal prostate cancer and will provide an experimental basis for future clinical trials testing the utility of an LNP-
Cas13d RNA targeting system to target this novel oncogenic mechanism in CRPC patients."

 Cerebral blood vessels are critical to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the brain, and to remove carbon
dioxide and other waste products. Although just 2% of the body’s weight, 20% of the circulation is directed to the
brain, highlighting the importance of the cerebral vasculature to the health and function of the brain. Blood
vessels that vascularize the central nervous system (CNS) harbor distinct physical, transport, metabolic, and
signaling properties, termed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Manifested within the endothelial cells (ECs) that line
the lumen of the CNS vasculature, these BBB properties stringently regulate the movement of molecules, ions,
and cells between the blood and the brain, allowing for proper neuronal function and safeguarding the neural
tissue against injury and disease. As such, many neurological diseases are associated with BBB disruption,
including multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy, and stroke.
 Recently it has been suggested that BBB dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD); however, the extent, nature, and contributions of this dysfunction to AD pathophysiology remains
enigmatic. To identify nuanced changes to the brain vasculature in AD, a vascular-specific proteomic approach
was employed. This approach revealed down-regulation of many enzymes involved in fatty acid and lipid
biosynthesis, namely ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7 (ELOVL7), in the cortical vasculature of AD patients compared
to controls. From here, this proposal will test the hypothesis that aberrant vascular lipid metabolism is a critical
component of AD pathophysiology. Many classes of lipids have been implicated in regulating the trafficking and
proteolytic activity of disease-relevant enzymes in AD. As lipid signaling is critical to brain homeostasis, vascular
integrity, and AD etiology, identification of the lipidomic changes occurring at the BBB during AD could give
important insight about the pathogenesis of AD and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets that can be used
to normalize the BBB in AD patients.
 While ELOVL7 has never been studied in brain ECs or in the context of AD, previous studies have
revealed that ELOVL7 is uniquely enriched in brain ECs in both mice and humans. Further, brain EC-specific
transcriptomic approaches have shown dynamic loss of ELOVL7 expression in neuroinflammatory mouse
models with known BBB disruption. Data such as these, taken together with the finding that ELOVL7 is
decreased in the brain vasculature of patients with AD, steers this proposal towards the hypothesis that ELOVL7
may be critical to BBB function and that its downregulation may contribute to AD etiology. This hypothesis will
be tested in vivo by conditional deletion of ELOVL7 within brain ECs of mice. Understanding the role of ELOVL7
at the BBB may elucidate crucial mechanisms of AD pathophysiology, and its downstream fatty acid metabolites
may prove to be viable therapeutics to normalize the brain vasculature in AD."

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes, is the leading cause of irreversible vision
loss in working-age Americans. As the number of Americans with diabetes continues to climb, the prevalence
of DR is expected to rise in coordination. Current therapies for DR treat only late stages of disease after
irreparable damage to the retina has occurred, highlighting the need for therapeutic interventions to prevent
early-stage progression. Since the 1960s, it has been hypothesized that retinal inflammation may drive early
DR progression in a cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent manner. However, trials of various nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to inhibit COX as a DR treatment have failed in large part due to severe
cardiovascular or gastrointestinal side effects associated with chronic, broad-spectrum COX inhibition by these
drugs. Alternatively, targeting specific prostanoids—the lipid signaling molecules downstream of COX—and/or
their receptors could offer a therapeutic approach that isolates anti-inflammatory benefits while avoiding the
severe side effects of NSAIDs. Five prostanoids are generated in the COX pathway, signaling through nine
prostanoid receptors. The goal of the research proposed here is to determine the therapeutic potential of
inhibiting individual prostanoid signaling to slow DR onset and progression. My preliminary studies have
identified that two of the five prostanoids—PGE2 and PGF2α—are elevated in primary human retinal cells
cultured in conditions of dyslipidemia or inflammation relevant to diabetes. PGE2 is elevated in Müller glia, cells
responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the retina, and PGF2α is elevated in retinal microvascular
endothelial cells, which form retinal blood vessels. I hypothesize that these two prostanoids are critical drivers
of proinflammatory cytokine production and leukostasis, hallmark pathologies associated with DR. This
proposal expands upon these findings to define the landscape of retinal prostanoid elevation under conditions
relevant to systemic diabetes and to determine the preclinical efficacy of small molecule prostanoid receptor
antagonists as targeted therapeutic strategies against DR progression. I propose utilizing primary human
cultures of Müller glia and retinal microvascular endothelial cells as well as a diabetic mouse model to
interrogate antagonism of prostanoid signaling in both cell- and animal-based disease-relevant experimental
models. In completing these studies, I aim to characterize a novel therapeutic strategy to precisely target
molecular signaling pathways that may drive retinal vascular inflammation in early-stage DR before irreversible
damage occurs. I will carry out my work in the supportive mentoring environment of Dr. John Penn’s laboratory
at Vanderbilt University, an institute with rich support of both prostanoid and vision research and with a long
history of exemplary graduate training. The training plan outlined in this proposal, paired with my research
goals, will aid invaluably in my training to become an independent academic research scientist."

Up to 75% of human-disease causing targets are considered “undruggable” using the current drug classes
available: small molecules and biologics. Many of these “undruggable” targets are involved in intracellular
protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are challenging to inhibit with small molecules and antibodies. Small
molecules require hydrophobic pockets for binding, which PPIs generally lack. Proteins are capable of disrupting
PPIs, but they generally cannot cross the cell's plasma membrane. Miniproteins are small proteins (<10 kDa)
with defined tertiary structure. They are a promising class of protein therapeutics that have shown great success
at inhibiting extracellular targets and several cell-penetrant miniproteins have been identified. However, we still
do not know the design rules needed to develop miniproteins with intracellular delivery. The main bottleneck to
developing cell-penetrating miniproteins is that measuring cytosolic delivery is slow and expensive because each
protein must be purified and tested individually. To overcome this experimental limitation, we will develop an
entirely new multiplexed approach to measure the cytosolic delivery of many candidate cell-penetrant
miniproteins at once. We hypothesize that a high-throughput approach will rapidly uncover new cell-penetrant
miniproteins to study the determinants of cytosolic delivery. In Aim 1, we will develop a cytosolic capture and
pull-down approach to screen cell-penetrant miniproteins. We will create an entirely new approach that quantifies
the cytosolic abundance of each miniprotein in a mass spectrometry-based approach. The goal of this aim is to
extensively validate this method and see enrichment of our known cell-penetrant protein from a mixture of
inactive proteins added to cells. In Aim 2, we will define the protein features that contribute to the cytosolic
delivery of miniproteins. We will perform a second round of protein design to validate the features found in our
initial screen. The goal of this aim is to apply a multiplexed approach for measuring cytosolic delivery and identify
the protein features of successful cell-penetrant miniproteins. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to
determine the protein features needed for cytosolic delivery to develop new cell-penetrant miniproteins capable
of inhibiting PPIs implicated in disease."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults. EGFR is expressed in the majority of
GBMs and aberrant EGFR signaling is a major driver of the malignant phenotype. Although the EGFR is
considered a prime oncogene in GBM, TCGA analysis indicates that in EGFR amplified GBMs, EGFR ligands
are tumor suppressive. Our preliminary data also suggest that ligand-activated EGFR is tumor suppressive.
The tumor suppressive effects of ligand-activated EGFR result form an unexpected suppression of invasion.
We propose that constitutive and ligand-dependent EGFR wild type signaling triggers distinct signaling
pathways. Thus, constitutive EGFR signaling promotes invasion while ligand-activated EGFR signaling turns
on proliferation and turns off invasion. We elucidate mechanisms underlying EGFR regulation of invasion and
identify BIN3, a protein known to influence the cytoskeleton, as a key suppressor of GBM invasion. We also
identify the mechanisms and biological significance of ligand-activated EGFR mediated glioma cell
proliferation. We examine the relative contribution of proliferation and invasion to tumor size and prognosis in
GBM. An improved understanding of mechanisms that drive GBM invasion is critical to improved treatment.
Furthermore, we identify tofacitinib as a drug that can activate the tumor suppressor function of EGFR by
increasing EGFR ligand, upregulating BIN3 and suppressing GBM invasion. Tofacitinib is a clinically available
and FDA approved drug. Our model holds true for GBMs that express EGFR wild type or the mutant
EGFRvIII. In Specific Aim 1: We elucidate the role of RTK transactivation in driving invasion or proliferation.
We test the hypothesis that constitutive EGFR signaling promotes EGFR invasiveness whereas ligand-induced
EGFR signaling blocks it. Constitutive EGFR signaling leads to activation of Met leading to increased
invasiveness. We also identify a TAB1-TAK1-NF- B pathway that drives GBM invasion. Ligand-activated
EGFR signaling leads to Axl activation and proliferation and decreased GBM invasiveness. In Specific Aim 2:
we uncover mechanisms used by EGFR to suppress invasiveness of GBM cells. We test the hypothesis that
BIN3 is a major negative regulator of invasion. Ligand-induced EGFR activity upregulates BIN3 and
suppresses invasion. We examine the expression patterns of BIN3, BIN3 partners, EGFR and other RTKs
networks in GBM. In Specific Aim 3 we examine the biological effects of constitutive vs. ligand induced
EGFR–RTK-BIN3 signaling on GBM invasion in an orthotopic mouse model and examine tofacitinib as a
treatment that specifically inhibits GBM invasion in ligand-poor GBMs. ."

The roles of noncoding (nc)RNAs in lymphoid cells harboring each of three oncogenic herpesviruses are being
investigated. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects and transforms human B cells; it is the causative agent of
infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several human cancers. Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) induces
fatal lymphomas and leukemias in New World monkeys and transforms human T lymphocytes in culture.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) afflicts immunocompromised individuals and persists in a
latent form until lytic activation. In recent years, we have focused our efforts on the structure and functions of
the two EBV-encoded EBERs, the seven HVS-encoded HSURs and six HVS microRNAs, as well as the KSHV
PAN RNA. These viral ncRNAs are all abundant, conserved between related viruses and bind host proteins to
form ncRNPs. Our functional studies have uncovered novel mechanisms of microRNA biogenesis and decay,
revealed that viral ncRNPs can be essential for nuclear processes as diverse as viral DNA replication (EBER2)
or mRNA export to the cytoplasm (PAN), identified the role of triple helices in RNA stabilization, and
contributed important insights into viral evolution. Most compelling is that our studies of viral ncRNAs have
uncovered the existence of and begun to elucidate novel cellular mechanisms such as the regulation of cellular
microRNA populations and how the polyA tail and 3′UTR may collaborate to stabilize cellular mRNAs.
 Proposed aims will exploit these advances to further investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We
shall extend our original discovery of target-directed microRNA decay (TDMD) to identify proteins and
additional RNA signals contributing to cellular microRNA degradation, as well as investigate the role of a
putative small RNA derived from the SARS-CoV-2 genome in regulating host immune responses, with potential
diagnostic/therapeutic implications. We shall establish how its polyA tail as well as internal sequences
contribute to PAN RNA's ability to enable the nuclear export of late lytic mRNAs, leading to virion protein
production and virion release. We shall search cellular transcriptome databases for the presence of RNA
sequence/structure motifs contributing to polyA-3′UTR interactions (and presumably RNA stabilization), as
recently revealed by our high-resolution X-ray analyses. Newly discovered triplex-forming elements (ENEs) in
coronavirus RNAs will be analyzed for their stabilization activity and possible contributions to viral protein
synthesis, with potential therapeutic applications. Extensive interactions between viral transcripts in EBV-
infected cells discovered by psoralen crosslinking will be validated and further analyzed."

Influenza A virus continues to be a major global health concern due to antigenic drifts and shifts. Rapid
antigenic drifts of circulating human influenza subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2), which are caused by point
mutations, can drastically hamper vaccine effectiveness despite annual update of the seasonal influenza
vaccine. On the other hand, antigenic shifts, which are caused by genetic reassortment between antigenically
distinct strains, can result in devastating pandemic as exemplified by the 1918 Spanish flu. Human infections
with different zoonotic subtypes, such as H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 have also been reported. As
a result, a universal influenza vaccine that can elicit broadly protective antibody responses to diverse influenza
strains and subtypes is urgently needed. The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target
the conserved stem region of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) has raised the possibility of developing a universal
influenza vaccine. A number of HA stem bnAbs are encoded by immunoglobulin heavy chain germline gene
IGHV6-1. Since these IGHV6-1 HA stem bnAbs can be found in multiple individuals and can cross-react with
both group 1 HAs (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16) and group 2 HAs (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14,
and H15), they represent the type of antibody response that needs to be induced by a universal influenza
vaccine. This proposed study will use innovative high-throughput experiments to define sequence features in
the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3, light chain, and somatic hypermutations, that enable
an IGHV6-1 antibody to be a cross-group HA stem bnAbs. The underlying molecular mechanisms will be
further characterized by structural biology approach. The results will help accurately estimate the germline
frequency of IGHV6-1 HA stem bnAbs and understand their affinity maturation pathway, which in turn will
benefit the design of a universal influenza vaccine. Furthermore, the experimental framework established in
this study will be applicable to characterize any antibody of interest."

impact biomolecular structure, dynamics, and function. More specifically, emphasis will
be placed on understanding enzyme function in the cellular context, interactions of cellular
environments with membranes, and the interaction\ of liquid-liquid phase separated
condensates with cytoplasmic environments. The research will employ computational
tools for modeling and simulations of biomolecular systems. Multiscale modeling and
novel machine learning tools will be developed to complement and enhance traditional
computational approaches so that the biological questions can be addressed more
efficiently. Connections to experiment will be made via collaboration. The insights gained
from this work will increase our fundamental understanding of biological function and
disease at the molecular level under consideration of cellular environments. Based on
these insights, it is expected that it will become possible to develop rational drug design
protocols targeting a variety of diseases that fully consider the cellular context."
10767304,"We reported recently that human and mouse diabetic retina have increased iron accumulation, and inducing
diabetes in a genetic mouse model of systemic iron overload resulted in accelerated progression of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). Iron, although an essential nutrient, when accumulated excessively leads to tissue damage.
However, systemic administration of iron chelators is not a feasible therapeutic option to reduce tissue iron levels
due to potential side effects of lowering serum iron levels. New mechanistic insights into the role of iron in ketone
body synthesis and utilization is a critical gap in knowledge addressed in this application facilitating new
therapeutic targets for DR. During conditions of prolonged fasting and diabetes, body utilizes fatty acids to make
ketone bodies as an alternate metabolic fuel. β- hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), acetoacetate and acetone, the three
ketones produced in the body, are metabolically important because their accumulation in blood can cause
ketoacidosis and secondly, depending on the physiological state, ketones supply energy for cell survival. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that retinal iron accumulation during DR inhibits endogenous ketone β-
OHB production, activating NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and thereby accelerating cell death. We will test
our hypothesis using three distinct conceptual, computational and experimental strategies. In aim 1, we will
explore how cellular iron accumulation modulates endogenous ketone body synthesis. Liver, colon and retina
synthesize most of the endogenous ketones. Here, we propose to determine the effect of iron on the function of
the mitochondrial enzyme Bdh1, which catalyzes the final reaction for producing β-OHB, the principal ketone in
circulation using 2 novel mouse lines, constitutive and RPE-specific Bdh1 knockout mice. In aim 2, we will
examine the mechanisms by which iron-associated decrease in ketone body β-OHB impacts inflammation during
DR. Our lab and others have reported that retinal iron increases NLRP3 inflammasome. A report in Nature
Medicine showed that exogenous β-OHB, but not the ketone acetoacetate, reduces NLRP3 inflammasome. Here
we propose to investigate if iron associated reduction in endogenous β-OHB synthesis augments inflammation
through histone deacetylase-Foxo3a signaling. In aim 3, we will explore the effect of iron on the uptake of
hepatic/RPE produced β-OHB by the neuronal cells, which are primarily dependent on ketone bodies during
conditions of low glucose availability. We previously reported that monocarboxylate transporter SMCT1, the only
known β-OHB transporter in ganglion cells, is downregulated during iron overload in retina. We will analyze the
epigenetic mechanisms by which iron alters cellular uptake of β-OHB in neuronal cells causing cell death. The
three proposed aims are supported by the past 10 years of training in iron homeostasis, a vibrant research
environment at SLU, and continuing professional guidance and collaboration with senior faculty. Successful
completion of this project will advance our understanding of how iron alters ketone metabolism and drive the
field into new and underexplored areas, like metabolic reprogramming for efficient ketone body utilization."
10781139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The objective of this study is to develop a new long-acting injectable (LAI) delivery system that provides
tunable and sustained release of protein therapeutics, demonstrate its effectiveness in sustained local delivery
of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and agrin targeted to nerve and muscle tissue, and assess its functional
efficacy for treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in rat and NHP models. Current options for treating patients
with PNI offer limited functional recovery due to the deleterious effects of prolonged denervation in the target
muscle and progressive muscle atrophy. IGF-1 has shown potent trophic and anti-apoptotic effects on neural
cell types and muscle cells; though requires frequent and high doses to achieve therapeutic outcomes due to its
short half-life in vivo. However, clinical translation of such an approach is difficult due to the risks associated with
high systemic dose of IGF-1. We have recently developed a kinetically controlled assembly method for
preparation of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) that are capable of high loading, high bioactivity retention, and
when given locally in affected muscle tissue and nerve tissue, provide sustained release of IGF-1, and
demonstrated significantly improved functional recovery following local delivery in a rat PNI model. In addition,
motor nerve-derived glycoprotein agrin is indispensable for neuromuscular junction formation and maintenance.
Thus, we hypothesize that maintaining a sufficient concentration of agrin in target muscle for 3 months until
reinnervation can further increase the level of functional recovery. In this design-driven study, we aim to optimize
the delivery capacity of NPs and generate an off-the-shelf LAI delivery platform for both IGF-1 and agrin over 10
to 12 weeks and demonstrate the competitive advantage of this approach for functional regeneration using
translational PNI models that recapitulate the clinically observed deleterious effects and anatomical features of
PNI. We will pursue the following four aims: (1) to establish a new nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery system that
achieves tunable and sustained release profile for IGF-1 and agrin; and understand the mechanism of high
loading capacity, sustained release kinetics, and bioactivity retention; (2) to engineer NP-embedded hyaluronic
acid (HA) hydrogel microparticles (MPs) as an off-the-shelf LAI system to extend IGF-1 and agrin release
duration with preserved bioactivity and NP retention; and measure IGF-1 and agrin release kinetics and
biodistribution following in vivo delivery in rats; (3) to assess efficacy of the optimized LAI system for IGF-1/agrin
delivery in a chronic PNI rat model; and (4) to confirm efficacy, biocompatibility and safety of the optimized LAI
delivery system in a new definitive preclinical NHP PNI model. Successful completion of this study will offer an
LAI system specifically designed to transform the clinical treatment of PNI and demonstrate its translational
potential regarding scalable manufacturing and functional efficacy in clinically relevant PNI models. It will also
provide a versatile LAI platform for local and sustained delivery of a wide range of protein therapeutics."
10780091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Numerous biochemical and biophysical studies have demonstrated that amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates into
toxic oligomers and fibrils when the concentration of the peptide is elevated and the pH is low (Paredes-Rosan
et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2018). Aβ aggregates can be detected neuron throughout the endo-lysosomal pathway
(Brewer et al. 2020) where pH ranges from 4.5-6.5 which are prime conditions for Aβ to aggregate. However,
what physiological processes influence Aβ aggregation in vivo within this compartment remain unknown.
Elevated synaptic activity increases the formation of Aβ within endosomes before it is secreted into the brain
interstitial fluid (ISF) (Cirrito et al. 2005, 2008). We hypothesize that elevated synaptic activity not only
causes formation of Aβ, but also directly drives formation and release of Aβ aggregates. We propose
that low, physiological synaptic activity causes release of Aβ monomer, whereas high bursts of aberrant
activity reach a threshold when the combination of low pH endosomes with sufficiently high Aβ levels induces
aggregation. We have developed a novel electrochemical micro-immunoelectrode (MIE) technology to
measure Aβ40, Aβ42, or Aβ oligomer levels every 60 seconds in an awake, moving mouse for up to 6 hours in
order to tightly link the amount of synaptic activity with the level and conformation of Aβ. Furthermore, we will
determine if glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons are primarily responsible for producing Aβ and if one type of
neuron is more prone to generate aggregates. All studies will use the APPNLF/NLF knock-in mouse model of
amyloidosis in order to preserve normal expression patterns of APP which is critical for these types of studies.
Our preliminary data demonstrates the tight link between synaptic activity and Aβ generation, as well as the
characterization and specificity of the MIE technology for real-time detection of Aβ levels and aggregates.
Using the MIE, preliminary data suggest that only a slight increase in neuronal activity produces Aβ monomer
but that higher levels of activity induce secretion of Aβ aggregates. Also, our data suggests that excitatory
neurons produce more Aβ than inhibitory neurons. While we propose that synaptic activity is a potent regulator
of Aβ oligomer and fibril formation, we acknowledge that there are several means that will induce and influence
aggregation, such as chaperones like apoE, and that synaptic activity is just mechanism that can generate
these toxic species.
 Aim 1 will determine the threshold of synaptic activity that causes Aβ to aggregate into soluble oligomers
then get released into the brain ISF. Aim 2 will determine whether excitatory or inhibitory neurons release Aβ
monomer or Aβ aggregates, and if that differs between wake and sleep states, since inhibitory tone is much
greater during sleep. Aim 3 will determine if chronically modulating activity of excitatory or inhibitory neurons
within the hippocampus alters development of Aβ plaques.
 How synaptic activity impacts Aβ species and aggregation state is unclear. The scientific premise of this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms that contribute to Aβ generation and aggregation in vivo. The FDA
recently approved a monoclonal antibody, Lecanemab, that targets Aβ oligomers and finally has clinical
benefits to patients. Understanding the source of oligomers could inform on risk factors that influence
aggregation and lead to new therapies targeting oligomers in the future or identifying novel biomarkers for
disease development."

Cancer is a major global public health problem and the second leading cause of death in the United States. Many
cancer types display differences in incidence between the sexes, and these differences are only partially
explainable by non-genetic factors, such as hormonal differences, carcinogen exposure, lifestyle, and access to
health care. To date, our understanding of how genetic factors – particularly those encoded on the sex
chromosomes – contribute to sex-specific differences in cancer pathogenesis has remained incomplete. A
fundamental genetic difference between males and females is in the composition and regulation of the X-
chromosome (chrX); relative to male somatic cells, female somatic cells have an extra chrX. Most of the genes
on one copy of chrX in females are epigenetically silenced via the process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI),
resulting in one active (chrXa) and one inactive (chrXi) chromosome X. Additionally, we have recently discovered
that XIST – the long non-coding RNA that initiates XCI – can be somatically expressed in a subset of male
cancers. We therefore hypothesize that somatic alterations of the X chromosome may perturb XCI in both
females and males, leading to either oncogenic or deleterious gene expression changes. In this project, we will
study the role of somatic chrX alterations in cancer in both male and female contexts via two aims. In Aim 1, we
will anchor our studies in translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC), a subtype of kidney cancer usually driven
by oncogenic rearrangements involving the TFE3 gene on chrX. While all other kidney cancers are male-
predominant, tRCC displays a ~2:1 female bias in incidence, prompting the hypothesis that the presence of an
extra copy of chrX in females doubles the risk for developing oncogenic TFE3 fusions. This implies that TFE3
rearrangements can arise from chrXi in females, which would necessitate a disruption of XCI and the reactivation
of ordinarily silenced genes. We will develop haplotype-specific bioinformatic methods to distinguish between
chrXa and chrXi and deploy these methods across a range of genomic datasets to understand the transcriptional
consequences of rearrangements on each of the chrX homologs in tRCC. We will also model TFE3 fusions using
CRISPR/Cas9 to explore the differential transcriptional and functional implications of TFE3 rearrangements
involving chrXa vs chrXi. In Aim 2, we will expand upon our surprising observation that some male cancers can
somatically activate XIST expression. We will determine to what extent somatic activation of XIST in males is
associated with the features of stable chrX silencing seen in female XCI. We will also determine whether somatic
XIST activation in males confers selective genetic vulnerabilities that may represent sex-specific cancer
dependencies. This project will leverage innovative genomic and functional genetic approaches to explore
fundamental questions about how somatic alterations on chrX contribute to cancer pathogenesis. More broadly,
this work seeks to establish a new paradigm for our understanding of the genetic factors that drive sex bias in
cancer initiation and progression and to identify novel strategies to target tumors in a sex-specific fashion."

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is a
leading cause of death in intensive care units. The contact of pathogens with the intravascular compartment of
the host leads to systemic inflammation, wherein activation of the complement and coagulation systems plays
critical roles.
The objectives of this proposal are to investigate the role of complement activation and its crosstalk with
inflammation and coagulation to sepsis progression and multiple organ failure (MOF) and, whether blocking
complement activation at the C5 level could prevent MOF and improve the outcome of sepsis.
We will use clinically relevant models of sepsis caused by two of the most common pathogens, Escherichia coli
and Staphylococcus aureus to: (i) determine the contribution of complement and coagulation to pathogenesis
of microthrombosis, vascular dysfunction, organ failure and death; (ii) test stage-specific therapies targeting the
complement and coagulation cascades to provide organ protection and survival benefit in sepsis-induced
progressive MOF.
Successful completion of these aims will determine: (i) whether timed complement inhibition at the C5 level
could be used as an effective therapy for sepsis-induced MOF; (ii) if inhibition of C5a receptor-1 signaling could
attenuate disease progression and provide organ protection; (iii) if combination therapies employing early
treatment with an anticoagulant and a delayed treatment with a C5 inhibitor will provide synergistic protection
in cases of high septic bacteremia/shock.
Altogether, our project will combine basic and preclinical research to verify novel hypotheses on the
pathophysiology of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive sepsis, and test innovative approaches, which in
the long-term may save lives from this deadly disease with no specific cure."
10746411,"PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The overarching research goal of my lab is to define cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating cellular shape
change. Cellular shape change is a fundamental characteristic of metazoan cells, key to development,
physiology, and pathology. The formation and plasticity of neural networks are key examples of cell shape
change during development and physiology, whereas cell shape and motility goes awry in pathological
conditions, such as melanoma. We study two main themes during cellular shape change: The active control of
the cytoskeleton, which is acknowledged as critical to cellular shape change, and the concurrent remodeling of
the plasma membrane, which is perhaps less well appreciated. Although many cytoskeletal and membrane
remodeling components are known and their biochemical and structural characteristics described, we lack a
systematic understanding of how these disparate systems are regulated and coordinated to orchestrate cellular
shape change. Perhaps the most important problem in cell morphogenesis is understanding how cells perceive
cues in their environment and convert this extracellular information into shape changes through coordinated
cytoskeletal dynamics and plasma membrane remodeling; this is the focus of this proposal. Functions of small
GTPases and kinases have been extensively studied in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane
remodeling. Work from my lab identified an emerging role for E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulated cellular shape
change. We identified two E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM9 and TRIM67, which regulate cytoskeletal and exocytic
proteins and cellular shape changes in response to netrin. The extracellular morphogen netrin promotes neuronal
morphogenesis and cancer progression. Despite these important consequences, we know little about how cells
interpret netrin into shape changes. TRIM9 and TRIM67 provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the
function of ubiquitination in cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling, and how these functions are coordinated
during netrin triggered cell shape change and motility. TRIM9 and TRIM67 share similar sequences, localization,
and interaction partners, however our studies identified distinct functions of these related proteins and
antagonistic phenotypes associated with their deletion. The overarching goal of this program is to test the
hypothesis that TRIM9 and TRIM67 coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis during netrin-dependent
morphogenesis in multiple cell types. Since netrin plays roles in both neuronal development and cancer
pathogenesis, our work will exploit developing neurons and migrating melanoma cells as model systems. Our
preliminary and published data indicate both cell types respond to netrin and express TRIM9 and TRIM67. Our
work will illuminate fundamental generalities and cell type specific mechanisms of shape change, providing
mechanistic understanding of the coordination of the cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking during development
and metastasis."

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community- and hospital-acquired diseases.
Infections with antibiotic-resistant MRSA strains are associated with increased mortality. To
identify targets for anti-MRSA therapy, this proposal analyzes the trafficking of surface proteins,
which is essential for S. aureus colonization and invasive disease. Surface proteins are
anchored to the cell wall, a process that requires specific signals and targeting mechanisms.
Sortase A recognizes the LPXTG motif in C-terminal sorting signals, which are cut and
covalently linked to peptidoglycan. Two types of surface protein precursors are distinguished.
Precursors with canonical signal peptides are deposited in the envelope at the cell poles.
Precursors with YSIRKxxxGxxS motif signal peptides traffic to the cross-wall. Confined by
septal membranes during cell division, the cross-wall separates newly divided cells. It
represents the site of de novo peptidoglycan synthesis and is split for completion of the cell
cycle. Here we report that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is synthesized at septal membranes and
required for septal secretion of YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors. During secretion, the YSIRKx
peptide is removed from the precursor. We screened temperature-sensitive mutants for defects
in YSIRKxxxGxxS precursor secretion and identified variants with mutations in secA, secG and
pepV. secA mutants are defective for the transport of all precursors, polar and septal secretion.
secG and pepV mutants exhibit defects in septal secretion. SecA co-purifies with
YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors and with PepV. We will test the hypothesis that lipid products of LTA
synthesis are critical for the activation of PepV at septal membranes. Although YSIRKxxxGxxS
precursors associate with SecA, we predict that precursor complexes cannot activate SecYEG
translocons unless the YSIRKx peptide is removed. Upon completion of the cross-wall, LtaS,
the catalyst of LTA synthesis, is cut and released while the products of LTA synthesis are
dispersed until the next cell division cycle. The proposal will analyze LtaS variants defective in
LTA synthesis and LtaS cleavage and characterize the contributions of specific lipids and LtaS
regulation for septal secretion. We will characterize YSIRKxxxGxxS precursors bound to SecA
for their ability to activate translocons in the presence of specifc lipids and PepV and study
precursor mutants for their ability to activate SecYEG translocons. Last, we will characterize the
subcellular distribution of PepV, its association with septal lipids, ability to cleave YSIRKxxGxxS
precursors and contribution to S. aureus colonization and pathogenesis."
10770746,"Project Summary/Abstract: Daily living skills (DLS), which are the tasks (e.g., hygiene, cooking, laundry,
managing money) that individuals do to take care of themselves at home, school, work, and in the community,
are impaired in autistic adolescents without an intellectual disability (ID) such that their skills are 6-8 years
behind same-aged peers. Age appropriate DLS have been linked to achieving better adult outcomes in
employment, college, independent living, and overall quality of life. In the recent Lancet Commission on the
future of care and clinical treatment in ASD there was a call to action to address DLS in adolescence as a
potential intervention target to increase the likelihood of attaining positive adult outcomes. However, until our
team began developing and evaluating the Surviving and Thriving in the Real World (STRW) intervention,
there were no known comprehensive, evidence-based DLS interventions for autistic adolescents at this critical
developmental period. In two recent pilot randomized clinical trials (RCTs), STRW demonstrated statistically
significant and clinically meaningful gains in DLS (i.e., gains of 2-4 years of DLS over the course of a 14-week
intervention) compared to a control condition (i.e., PEERS social skills intervention). In our two pilot RCTs,
STRW was converted to telehealth due to COVID-19. There were equal DLS gains between in-person STRW
and STRW-telehealth (STRW-T) and there were numerous benefits to telehealth delivery. The next step in this
line of work is to assess the efficacy of STRW-T in a fully powered Phase 3 RCT compared to an attention
control condition (PEERS-telehealth; PEERS-T) and examine the impact of improved DLS on early adult
outcomes by following adolescents 6-months after high school graduation. We will enroll 192 autistic teens
without ID in the 11th/12th grades and randomize them to receive STRW-T (n = 96) or PEERS-T (n = 96).
Caregivers and adolescent participants will complete a comprehensive multi-method DLS battery (i.e.,
interview, survey, daily phone diaries, goal attainment scaling) at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-
up. Young adult outcomes in work, college, and quality of life will be assessed 6-months post-high school
graduation for all participants. The current proposal has the following aims: (1) examine the efficacy of STRW-
T on DLS compared to PEERS-T; (2) evaluate whether the improvement in DLS outcomes by STRW-T are
sustained at 6-month follow-up; (3) examine the effects of STRW-T intervention on outcomes in college, work,
and QoL after high school graduation compared to PEERS. We will also explore the mediating role of improved
DLS on young adult outcomes. If the aims of the proposed study are achieved, STRW-T would fill the gap in
the current evidence base for treating DLS in autistic adolescents and would be the first study to examine
whether a DLS intervention impacts work, college, and QoL outcomes after graduation from high school. Our
long term goal is to narrow the gap between age and DLS, and also fill the existing treatment gap by
disseminating and implementing this intervention into routine clinical practice for autistic teens."

of  the  US  population,  and  its  incidence  is  rapidly  increasing  since  obesity  and  metabolic  syndrome  are  growing 
epidemics  worldwide.  Although  the  risk  factors  are  well  defined,  HCC  is  still  an  aggressive  and  difficult-­to-­treat 
malignant  disease  with  poor  outcome  and  limited  therapeutic  options.  In  fact,  major  obstacles  for  effective

greater  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  underlying  liver  cancer  cell  plasticity  and  adaptation,  as  well  as 
developing novel therapeutic approaches to achieve more effective and selective cure of this disease.  
    Hsf1,  as  the  master  activator  of  the  classical  heat  shock  response  and  guardian  of  the  proteome,  has  been 
implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of  cancer.  We  have  discovered  that  genetic  inactivation  of  Hsf1  in  pre-­clinical

preliminary  studies  we  propose  a  novel  pathogenic  mechanism  whereby  Hsf1  activation  promotes  HCC 
development  by  stimulating  both  the  protein  folding  capacity  of  the  cell  and  regulating  anabolic  metabolic 
pathways,  thus  perpetuating  chronic  hepatic  metabolic  disease.  Our  recent  research  revealed  that  the  Hsf1

10773081,"RESOURCE COMPETITION DRIVES NATURAL AND REBOUND DYNAMICS OF SNAILS
AND SCHISTOSOMES
Project summary
 More than 250 million people are infected with schistosomes, flatworms in the genus
Schistosoma, and 20 million humans suffer from severe morbidity due to schistosomiasis.
Humans become infected after exposure to larval parasites (cercariae) that are produced by
infected snails in freshwater habitats. Therefore, the production of cercariae by snail populations
represents an important component of the human risk of exposure, infection, and disease.
 Schistosomiasis control incorporates many programs, including drug administration,
behavioral intervention and snail control. Snail control programs reduce snail density by
applying toxic chemical molluscicides or lethal predators. However, snails themselves do not
directly infect humans. Instead, snails release free living cercariae that directly cause human
infections following skin contact. This mismatch between the target of control (snails) and the
proximate cause of human infections (cercariae) complicates schistosome control because the
production of cercariae per snail is sensitive to ecological conditions, such as snail density.
 The vast majority of models and control trials examining the natural dynamics and
control of schistosomes assume that snails are all equally infectious, leading to the assumption
that snail density directly correlates with cercariae density, and therefore potential for human
exposure. However, infected snails can produce >50-fold more cercariae when food is
abundant, competitors are scarce, and physical conditions are otherwise benign. Thus, counter
to conventional wisdom, cercarial densities, and human exposure potential, could be greatest
when the density of snails is lower and growing. Therefore, studying the dynamic link between
snail and cercarial density is critical to designing optimal snail control strategies, because these
dynamics determine the timing and magnitude of human risk.
 This research will combine field and laboratory experiments to test novel hypotheses for
the dynamics of cercariae in natural settings that arise from theory we developed to explicitly
incorporate energy uptake and use by snails and schistosomes in dynamic scenarios.
Specifically, we will test predictions that: (1) there are brief, intense peaks of cercarial density
early in the season, when individual snails are large and highly reproductive, (2) the presence of
other food sources, such as decaying plants can sustain cercarial production over longer
periods, and (3) reducing, but not eliminating, snails from water bodies could backfire, causing
little reduction or even an increase in cercariae, by relaxing competition for food. Ultimately, this
work can improve the prediction and control of a parasite causing major global health burden."
10932241,"Project Summary
Down Syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD) is a serious neuropsychiatric syndrome that is of growing interest
among the Down syndrome (DS) community and the INCLUDE Down Syndrome Research Plan. Adolescent
and adult DSRD is associated with a subacute decline in cognitive and adaptive functioning, mood, and
catatonia, with the highest risk period between 10 and 30 years old. Symptoms cause severe disability in the
form of loss of ability to participate in activities of daily living and cause a great burden on parents and caregivers.
Without prompt treatment, DSRD may persist for years. Recommended medical evaluation is costly and
specialists are few and far between, making appropriate treatment difficult for some and inaccessible for others.
There are also significant gaps in research on the prevalence and causes of DSRD, due in part to the lack of
scalable assessments in large DS cohorts. Validated low-burden assessments are needed to identify patients,
monitor treatment response, and improve research.
This study aims to assemble a cohort of adolescents and young adults with DS and develop the DS-
Regression Rating Scale (DSRRS), a parent-report form, which will aid in assessment and advance
systematic research on the etiology and treatment of DSRD. To accomplish this, we will use a stakeholder-
informed approach to assemble a cohort of 600 adolescents and young adults with DS, with and without DSRD.
We will develop the DSRRS through an iterative process of focus groups, pre-testing, and item reduction. We
will validate the newly created scale against well-validated assessments of symptoms associated with DSRD
(e.g., stress, adaptive functioning, catatonia), examine the test-retest reliability, and examine sensitivity and
specificity to optimize recommended cutoff scores.
This project is in line with several priorities identified in the INCLUDE Down Syndrome Research Plan
(pp. 13 – 14). These tools will lay the groundwork for vital research for years to come aimed at identifying the
prevalence and etiologies, the gene-brain-behavior connections underlying DSRD, and most importantly, the
identification of prevention and intervention strategies to improve the lives of people with DS at risk for DSRD."
10747405,"The root cause of most breast cancer deaths is metastasis. By dissecting the molecular events driving it, the
research community can develop new therapeutic approaches to eradicate and prevent metastatic disease.
One promising avenue of research involves the cooperative behavior of tumor cells. Conventionally,
metastasis is conceptualized as the dissemination of individual tumor cells to distant organs. However, recent
studies by the Cheung research group and others have established that clusters of tumor cells metastasize to
distant organs more efficiently than single cells in mouse models, and that circulating tumor cell clusters are
associated with poor patient outcomes and therapy resistance in humans. The molecular mechanisms
responsible for aggression in tumor cell clusters and the optimal therapeutic strategies to eliminate clusters
have remained obscure. Recently, the Cheung laboratory has found that clustered tumor cells display
heightened levels of apoptosis resistance, cell proliferation, and changes in molecular expression that indicate
that the cells are cooperating with one another. These studies reveal that the tyrosine kinase EGFR is
activated at cell-cell contacts in clustered tumor cells, and they establish that EGFR and the low-affinity EGFR
ligand Epigen are necessary for cluster-dependent proliferation and metastatic colonization. The proposed
project will test the hypothesis that tumor cell clusters are highly metastatic because they contain a private
signaling environment involving EGFR, Epigen, and the transcription factor Fra-1, and that disrupting this
signaling environment will neutralize clusters’ metastatic potential. The Cheung lab has already developed
technically innovative organoid and murine models to study cluster-based signaling and its impact on
metastasis in vivo. Using these models, the lab will first determine whether cluster-induced metastatic
efficiency depends specifically on local activation by Epigen. Second, the lab will determine the impact of Fra-1
transcriptional programs and signaling feedback loops on metastatic processes specific to tumor cell clusters,
as well as whether this program depends on the presence of Epigen. Third, the lab will supplement its
experimental findings by studying the association between EGFR, Epigen, and long-term recurrence and
mortality data from human breast cancer datasets. Through this integrated approach, the Cheung lab will
develop an understanding of the cooperative molecular mechanisms that underlie the propensity of tumor cell
clusters to metastasize. As described in the proposal, this understanding is likely to reveal molecular
vulnerabilities that can be exploited to develop new anti-metastatic therapies. Although the work proposed here
focuses on uncovering therapeutic strategies to target tumor cell clusters in breast cancer, the findings will
potentially be relevant to a wide range of tumor types."
10918244,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive, non-inflammatory ectatic corneal disorder that is characterized by steepening
and thinning of the cornea, irregular astigmatism, myopia, and scarring. Despite the introduction of corneal
crosslinking to stop progression and improvements in scleral contact lens designs, corneal transplants remain
the holy grail of treating KC. KC is currently one of the most common indications leading to corneal transplants.
Furthermore, there is now increasing evidence that KC recurs even following corneal transplantation. To-date,
the KC etiology and pathogenesis remains unclear, including the reasons for recurrence. As such, there is an
urgent need to understand and define the onset/progression of KC. Our group is spearheading KC research on
sex hormones and gonadotropins, which will provide valuable contributions to a topic that is largely ignored
despite clinical observations and findings. Our group reported a novel sex hormone-regulated KC biomarker,
prolactin-induced protein (PIP), and discovered the existence of gonadotropins and their receptors in KC. It is
therefore fair to ask, “what is the role of gonadotropins in the human cornea and KC?” and “Is there a functional
role of these gonadotropins and their receptors that can explain KC pathobiology?”. Our preliminary data shows
dysregulation of what many consider the “king of all hormones”, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), in
KCs when compared to healthy controls. GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) is found in KC stromal cells and is modulated
by luteinizing hormone (LH) gonadotropin. LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), in turn, are modulated by
gonadal and adrenal sex hormones (Dehydroepiandrosterone-DHEA, Estrone, and Estriol) previously shown by
us to be imbalanced in KCs. These same sex hormones are modulated, systemically, following corneal
crosslinking. Together, our data suggests that KC is highly dependent on the balance and interactions of
gonadotrophins and sex hormones. Specifically, we hypothesize that hormonal secretion abnormalities are
associated with FSH and LH, followed by sex hormone dysregulation that ultimately affects the corneal
microenvironment mediating KC onset and progression. The current proposal is designed so that findings are
validated both in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, in order to maximize translatability. To ensure that we achieve our
goals, we have assembled a large cohort of experts in the field from multiple centers. Successful completion of
the studies proposed will be a breakthrough, altering the current standards of care for patients with KC.
Relevance to Public Health – KC is a major clinical problem resulting in visual impairment worldwide. There is
an urgent need to delineate the KC pathobiology and develop novel tools for its detection and treatment.
Ultimately, the goal is to enable people with KC to live a normal life with little or no visual disability. The proposed
work is translational, clinically relevant, and in line with NEI’s program goals: “Apply the knowledge acquired
from discoveries in the basic science of the cornea and other tissues of the ocular surface to the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of ocular injury and disease”."
10994501,"Seizures are one of the most common reasons why bystanders call Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for a child, and current practice frequently fails due to under-dosing and delayed delivery of anti-seizure medication. Benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, given in the nose or as a muscular injection are the first line treatment for seizures. Unfortunately, one-third of actively seizing children have ongoing seizures on arrival to the emergency department (ED) because an inadequate and delayed dose of midazolam fails to stop seizures. Children who continue to seize have seizures that are harder to stop, and this puts them at risk for not breathing and having brain damage. Reducing this risk requires equipping paramedics with a simplified method for rapidly determining and administering a therapeutic dose of medication. Paramedics suggest simplifying midazolam dosing by eliminating the error-prone, sequential calculations required to determine a weight-based dose under stressful conditions. Standardized, age-based dosing may be simpler, faster and more effective, without compromising safety. The overall objective of the Pediatric Dose Optimization for Seizures in EMS (Pedi DOSE) study is to measure the impact of standardized EMS midazolam dosing on seizure treatment effectiveness and safety. To achieve this objective, we will conduct a large EMS trial to implement standardized, age-based midazolam dosing for pediatric seizures in 20 EMS systems nationally. We believe that implementation will stop more seizures before children arrive at EDs without increasing respiratory failure rates. The first aim of this study is to compare the impact of standardized EMS midazolam dosing relative to conventional dosing on seizure cessation. We hypothesize that giving a standardized midazolam dose based on age will allow paramedics to stop a child’s seizure faster than conventional dosing with current practice. The second aim of this study is to determine how often children stop breathing or ineffectively breathe after implementation of standardized EMS midazolam dosing. We hypothesize that standardized EMS midazolam dosing is associated with no difference in slow or absent breathing relative to conventional dosing with current practice. If this study demonstrates that standardized, age-based midazolam dosing is both safe and more effective than current practice, the potential impact of this study is a paradigm shift in the treatment of pediatric seizures that can be easily implemented in emergency medical services (EMS) systems across the country."
10855764,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Disordered eating, encompassing both cognitive (e.g. body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, preoccupation
with losing weight) and behavioral factors (e.g. counterproductive behaviors like laxative use, binge eating, and
vomiting for weight control), is particularly harmful given its association with metabolic risk factors. Weight
stigma has emerged as a risk factor for disordered eating, and over 200 million Americans have a body mass
index that puts them at risk for experience weight stigma. However, there are three major gaps in the literature.
Prior work has examined associations between weight stigma and disordered eating behaviors via
observational and longitudinal methods, and thus whether weight stigma causes disordered eating is unknown.
Moreover, research has not examined the presence of disordered eating symptoms in everyday life after
exposure to weight stigma. Finally, potential social resilience factors remain unexplored. Therefore, the current
study will combine experimental manipulation with daily diary methodology to evaluate the causal effect of
weight stigma on daily disordered eating symptoms and test belonging and group identification as social
resilience factors that confer protection against disordered eating. This project will capitalize on the
infrastructure of Sponsor Tomiyama’s parent R01 (R01HL158555) and will add comprehensive measurement
of disordered eating symptoms in 300 overweight (BMI  28) adult participants recruited from the greater Los
Angeles area to address two aims: 1) Assess the causal effects of weight stigma on disordered eating
symptoms in daily life and 2) Investigate social resilience factors that provide protection against disordered
eating symptoms. This study will help to understand the impact of weight stigma and identify resilience factors
to prevent disordered eating. The current proposal could aid in identifying those who may be more vulnerable
to disordered eating as a consequence of weight stigma, or identify future intervention strategies, and in turn,
promote metabolic health.
Throughout the fellowship period, with the support of Sponsor Dr. A. Janet Tomiyama and Collaborators Drs.
Craig Enders, Theodore Robles, and Kendrin Sonneville, I will be working to achieve four training aims: 1)
Master advanced quantitative analysis skills, specifically in multilevel modeling and growth curve analysis, 2)
Expand knowledge in disordered eating, specifically in adulthood, 3) Develop expertise in social resilience
factors, and 4) Prepare for a career as an independent researcher. I will accomplish these goals by attending
and participating in lab meetings and workshops, presenting my work at academic conferences, and enrolling
in coursework. Further, I will be focusing on four subaims that will prepare me for a career as an extramurally
funded researcher at an R1 institution, including engaging in open science, executing evidence-based
practices in mentoring, building grant writing skills, and practicing scientific dissemination."
10778635,"Project Summary (P2). The control of adaptive behavior, at its most fundamental level, relies on appropriately
weighting the rewards and aversive outcomes, and deciding when to take a risk to maximize reward, and when
to play it safe. Malfunctions in these processes are associated with psychiatric disorders and maladaptive
behavioral states, such Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and anxiety. But despite their importance in
everyday decision making and clinical settings, little is known about how aversive outcomes influence value-
based decision making. In particular, in non-human primates, the closest animal model to humans, the
neuronal mechanisms of how the brain evaluates and anticipates aversive events is poorly understood. P2 will
(1) assess how the brain controls decision making under the risk and uncertainty of aversive outcomes in non-
human primates and (2) in collaboration with other projects in the Conte Center, will utilize this information to
shed light on the circuit mechanisms of, and novel therapies for, OCD and related pathologies. Aim 1 will
utilize functionally targeted in-vivo anterograde tracing to identify regions within vlPFC, insula, and other
regions that receive inputs from an area in ACC that has been functionally implicated in processing value and
uncertainty of aversive outcomes. In the same animals, we will perform electrophysiological examinations of
newly identified brain regions and assess whether and how they contribute to the processing of valuation,
uncertainty, and receipt of aversive reinforcements. With P1, we will understand the relationship between
functional properties of the OCD related brain areas and their anatomic connectivity. With P3-P5, we will relate
single neuron data in non-human primates to ongoing therapy development and circuit mapping efforts in
humans. Aim 2. will utilize a combination of computational and experimental methods to assess how the
neural encoding of information about aversive reinforcements could give rise to OCD-like maladaptive behavior
under aversive-outcome uncertainty. This Aim will utilize the probabilistic approach-avoidance task (PAAT),
that we developed with P3, to determine the mental algorithms involved in aversive decision making under
uncertainty and derive their neural underpinnings in the ACC-vlPFC-insula circuit. It will then disrupt the neural
activity in identified sub regions of the circuit to obtain causal evidence for their contributions to specific
aspects of behavioral control in PAAT. The unprecedented precision of single neuron recordings in this Aim will
inform the interpretation of imaging data in other Projects. Furthermore, a wide range of direct manipulation
methods for mediating OCD-related circuitry will be explored to facilitate the development of novel treatments
for OCD in P5. In sum, these Center-integrated Aims represent crucial steps for our understanding of the
neurobiology of OCD and more generally will broaden our understanding of the mechanisms of decision
making. Particularly, in collaboration with other projects of the Center, they will shed light on how brain areas
known to be crucially involved in OCD mediate our everyday decision making."
10778636,"ABSTRACT. The goal of Project 3 (P3) is to characterize, in OCD, white matter (WM) bundle and functional
neural abnormalities among regions in a putative OCD neural network that are associated with persistent
avoidance, a characteristic feature of OCD. Our overarching Center renewal hypothesis, building on our present
findings, is that persistent avoidance in OCD is a manifestation of dysfunctional connections among specific
hubs, i.e., subregions that integrate and distribute information from multiple regions, in the ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (vlPFC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and other regions in the OCD network, including the
insula, dorsal ACC (dACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and rostral striatum. These dysfunctional connections
lead to impaired behavioral flexibility in response to changing contextual cues, specifically in situations with
uncertain aversive outcomes. In P3, we will recruit and examine 50 unmedicated/ serotonin reuptake
inhibitor/clomipramine medicated participants with OCD, and 50 healthy participants (18-35 yrs; to minimize
effects of long illness history and medication on neural measures). We will use state-of-the-art diffusion imaging
(dMRI), using tractography, segmentation and tract profiling - tractometry - to examine WM bundles in the
network. We will use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine activity, functional and effective
connectivity (FC, EC) among network regions during a novel probabilistic approach avoidance task (PAAT) that
we developed to examine the influence of uncertain rewarding and aversive outcomes on choice behavior, and
neural activity, FC and EC during evaluation and anticipation of these outcomes. We will examine relationships
among WM, activity, FC and EC abnormalities in the OCD network in OCD participants and the severity of OCD
symptom dimensions associated with persistent avoidance, e.g., harm avoidance. Gender will be a covariate in
analyses. Aim (A)1 will compare the microstructure of WM bundles that connect vlPFC, rACC, insula, dACC,
OFC and rostral striatum in OCD vs. healthy participants, using a novel combination of tractography,
segmentation and tractometry. A2 will compare activity within and FC and EC among these OCD network regions
in OCD vs. healthy participants during the PAAT, to determine relationships among PAAT performance and fMRI
abnormalities in OCD vs. healthy participants. A3 will examine relationships among OCD symptom dimensions
that are relevant to persistent avoidance: e.g., harm avoidance, contamination/ washing, responsibility for
harm/checking symptoms, and: WM and fMRI abnormalities in A1-2. P3 will benefit from expertise in: NHP
neuroanatomy and physiology in P1, 2 (A2); dMRI data analysis in P1, Core B (A1); clinical assessment and
treatment of OCD in P4, 5 (A3); the study of individual differences in neuroanatomy in Core C (A2-3); and
integration of analyses across projects in Core D. In close collaboration with other projects and cores, P3 will be
the first study to elucidate the specific WM bundle, and functional, OCD network abnormalities that are
associated with persistent avoidance, to inform interventions for disorders characterized by this behavior."

McLean Hospital Project 4
 The main goal of the proposed project, entitled “Modulation of the OCD neural network by conventional
treatment,” is to study how conventional interventions for severe OCD – intensive exposure and response
prevention (ERP) therapy and standard of care medication management – affect the putative OCDnet to further
our understanding of how commonly available, efficacious treatments for OCD impact neural circuits involved in
avoidance and aversive uncertainty. To achieve this goal, P4 will identify abnormalities in the vlPFC, rACC,
insula, dACC, OFC and rostral striatum that track with performance on the PAAT and clinical symptom reports
in individuals with OCD as they receive intensive treatment and undergo changes in illness burden over time.
The project will follow 95 individuals with OCD using intensive longitudinal assessment of brain and behavior
over the typical ~8wk treatment course. P4 will build on our group’s operational experience performing serial
MRI (functional and structural) and detailed serial clinical assessments in OCD, and our toolkit for intensive
longitudinal assessment, currently deployed in other NIMH-funded data collection efforts and developed with
members of Core C, to identify changes in the OCDnet, persistent avoidance (as measured on PAAT and with
exploratory device-based measures), and clinical changes in OCD. Three sets of comprehensive study visits
(before, during, and after treatment) with MRI and clinical assessments will provide illness trajectory information
for probing relationships between changing constructs at a coarse timescale, complemented by low-burden,
digital phenotyping to capture variation at intermediate and finer time scales. Elucidating the ways in which the
putative OCDnet changes in relation to changes in clinical and therapeutic parameters will provide targets for
new interventions for OCD and help understand how and in which individuals currently available treatments
achieve their optimal therapeutic benefit."
10778639,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to study three direct circuit based interventions for intractable OCD to (1)
advance our understanding of the neurocircuitry of the disorder and to (2) leverage that understanding in order
to develop individualized approaches to treatment that will improve safety and efficacy. Our first aim is to
examine the effects of MRI guided laser thermal ventral capsulotomy in twenty patients with intractable OCD
using diffusion imaging to identify cortifugal axons affected by the lesions in individuals that are related to
treatment response. We will also study the effects of lesions on individual resting state and task based (PAAT)
functional connectivity and their relationship to treatment outcome measures. We will utilize novel acquisition
and analytic algorithms for individuals designed by Cores B and C as well as interact with Projects 1, 3 and 4
to identify false negatives and positives in the diffusion scans and to compare imaging results in patients
undergoing intensive non-surgical treatments to those with lesions. The second aim is to conduct a pilot
feasibility study, using a double blind crossover design, of a dual DBS implant in the vALIC and anterior
cingulate bundle. The Medtronic Percept system will allow stimulation and recording of LFPs, in four patients
with intractable OCD. We will stimulate and record in the vALIC and anterior cingulate, using pre-implant
diffusion imaging and electric field modeling to identify which tracts are being activated. We will study the
effects of stimulation at different contacts on the PAAT, and compare this to results obtained with
electrophysiological recordings in the primate. Leveraging methodology developed by our collaborators (U
Goodman, Dougherty) we will identify potential biomarkers of OCD provocation and treatment response. We
will interact with Project 1 and 2 to compare anatomic and electrophysiological results across humans and
primates as well as Cores B and C for imaging acquisition and analysis. Our third aim is to leverage ongoing
studies of low intensity focused ultrasound in twenty-four patients with intractable OCD (Dougherty, Goodman
PIs) and obtain pre post diffusion and task based (PAAT) functional imaging in those patients. We will compare
these results to those found in lesions and DBS in the vALIC target and draw on CORE B and C as well as
Project 1 and 2 to compare imaging results with nonsurgical OC subjects."
10778646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Neurocomputational Modeling Core is to provide a common formal framework
that can incorporate measures of neural activity, connectivity, and behavior across Projects 1-5 to (a) quantify
the functional roles of the OCDnet and its components in approach-avoidance decision-making and OCD
symptomatology, and (b) predict changes in decision-making dynamics and symptom severity as a result of
neural and clinical interventions. To achieve these goals, we will leverage (a) models of decision dynamics and
their modulation by neural activity within individual circuit nodes, and (b) graph-theoretic models of interactions
across circuit nodes. To quantify decision dynamics during the PAAT task, we will use hierarchical Bayesian
parameter estimation of the drift diffusion model (HDDM), which enables reliable estimation of decision
parameters and their modulation by trial-by-trial variance in neural signals, and supports Bayesian hypothesis
testing for how these parameters may differ as a function of clinical status and neuromodulation. We have
previously shown how such “computational biomarkers” can discriminate between patient conditions and
symptoms better than traditional measures of behavior and brain activity, including in an approach-avoid
context. We will test how PAAT choices are modulated by a combination of task variables (e.g., rewarding and
aversive outcomes), neural activity across OCDnet nodes, and OCD symptom severity. Preliminary results
show that the HDDM captures expected differences in choice dynamics (e.g., choice bias) between patients
and healthy controls. To quantify task-related functional interactions across this circuit, we will use ancestral
graph models, which measure the strength and direction of information flow across graph nodes. We will use
this combination of modeling approaches to test for changes in decision and circuit dynamics resulting from
targeted interventions (e.g., lesions, stimulation, treatment). Machine learning methods will quantify the degree
to which such quantitative model fitting improves (1) classification of patient condition and (2) our ability to map
changes in behavior, circuit dynamics, and disease course following interventions. Building on our extensive
experience in neural networks and levels of computation involved in motivated learning and decision making
across species, our computational framework will facilitate not only enhanced sensitivity to discriminate
between clinical conditions, but will also identify hypotheses about the likely mechanisms involved, which will
be tested via causal manipulations using the same quantitative framework. Contribution to Overall Center
Goals & Interactions with Other Center Components. Our modeling framework will be applied to data across all
Projects, including measures of connectivity (P1), behavioral and neural activity (P2-5), clinical measures (P3-
5), and influences of neural (P2&5) and behavioral (P4) interventions. Cores B & C will help with localization
and estimation of neural activity. We will benefit from interactions amongst experts with complementary
expertise in systems and cognitive neuroscience, psychiatry, engineering, and computational modeling."
10779519,"Complement, a part of innate immunity, eliminates invading microorganisms, apoptotic cells, and cellular debris
to maintain the homeostasis of the cellular environment. The complement pathway is tightly regulated to prevent
the consequences of inflammation. This regulation can be disrupted by disease, infection, aging, genetic
variation or any combination. The long-term objective of this proposal is to uncover the effect of Alternative
Pathway (AP) genetic variations on the local complement response in epithelial cells. Our experiments will be
done on Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) cells differentiated from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)
obtained from patients with intermediate Age-related Macular Degeneration. In our first aim we will differentiate
8 iPSCs lines to RPE, four of which have CFH risk alleles and another four which have the risk alleles corrected
to non-risk (isogenic controls). After the iPSCs have reached RPE maturity we will quantitate mRNA and protein
levels and functional capabilities of complement system players (components, regulators and receptors)
synthesized by iPSC-RPE cells. In addition, intracellular AP levels will be determined for iPSC-RPE and their
isogenic controls. These results will inform the influence of genetic variation on secretion of complement proteins
into the extracellular environment, their intracellular content and pathway differences. Because extracellular
vesicles (EVs) are an important cargo for complement and non-complement proteins we will investigate in the
second aim the differences in EV protein content secreted from iPSC-RPE cells from apical and basal membrane
locations. Our working hypothesis is that the EV protein content and quantity will differ between cells which have
the CFH risk variants and their isogenic controls which carry non-risk CFH variants. Secreted proteins also
contribute to deposit formation under the cells, which we will investigate by scanning electron microscopy and
immunostaining. Cells and their isogenic controls will be exposed to smoke extract and cytokines to determine
if the EVs, deposit composition and complement system players (components, regulators and receptors) are
influenced by CFH risk variants. Our preliminary results of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of RPE
have led to our central hypothesis that complement plays a crucial role in maintenance of healthy RPE. But the
GWAS results on AMD suggest a dysfunction in the complement system. Overall, these studies will provide
unique knowledge about the influence of genetic variation on the complement pathway by its focus on functional
assays. Our interdisciplinary team is uniquely poised to address this fundamental question by combining our
broad background of GWAS and genetic variants of AMD (Stambolian), complement genetics (Atkinson) and
RPE complement and extracellular vesicle analysis (Rohrer). The proposal’s outcomes will fill a critical gap in
our understanding of genetic variants on RPE complement activity and identify new potential therapeutic targets
directed at the RPE. We predict that these results will also have implications for other epithelial cells that serve
as barriers in the kidney and lung, also targets of complement activation in human diseases."
10786109,"Histone protein H2A and variant H2A.X play central roles in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) in mammalian chromatin. Near DSBs, chromatin becomes enriched in H2A.X which gets
phosphorylated by ATM kinase. Phosphorylation of H2A.X sets off a cascade of post-translational
modifications (PTMs) culminating with the recruitment of RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 to DNA
damage sites. RNF168 and cognate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5c catalyze the mono-
ubiquitylation of histones H2A and H2A.X at lysine residues 13 and 15 (H2AK13ub and H2AK15ub) in the
nucleosome core particle. These two PTMs are recognized by and determine the recruitment to damaged
chromatin of several DNA damage response (DDR) proteins including 53BP1, BRCA1/RAP80, RAD18 and
RNF169 that control the balance between the DSB repair pathways of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)
and homologous recombination (HR). The goal of this research program is to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which H2A and H2A.X are involved in the DDR. Using NMR spectroscopy, X-ray
crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, biochemistry and cell biology, we will probe how RNF168-UbcH5c
generates H2AK13ub and H2AK15ub and how these PTMs are recognized by HR-promoting DDR proteins in
the context of the nucleosome. We will also test the hypothesis that ubiquitylation of H2A.X at lysine residues
13 or 15 directly contributes to chromatin decompaction, thereby facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair
proteins to DSBs. Finally, we will address the mechanism of H2A/H2A.X exchange and H2A.X enrichment at
DSBs promoted by human histone chaperone FACT. Collectively, our work will provide fundamental
knowledge relevant to NHEJ and HR repair mechanisms with important implications for human health as
explained in the Narrative paragraph. As is often the case in research, it is likely that new unanticipated and
fascinating questions will arise during our studies that, in keeping with the MIRA R35 mechanism, we will
tackle as needed."

Insulin resistance is the product of gene-environment interactions. A recently identified major mediator of these gene-environment interactions is the gut microbiome. To begin to dissect the role of the microbiome in gene-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity, we have developed a novel model taking advantage of three strains of laboratory mice: C57Bl6/J and 129S1 mice from Jax (B6J and 129J) and 129S6 mice from Taconic (129T). When challenged with high fat diet (HFD), B6J mice are insulin resistant and obesity- and diabetes-prone, while 129J mice are insulin sensitive and obesity- and diabetes-resistant. 129T mice, which are similar genetically to 129J, on the other hand, gain almost as much weight as B6J mice on HFD, but remain insulin sensitive and non-diabetic, i.e., are a model of “metabolically healthy” obesity. While genetics plays a role in these phenotypic differences, the microbiome also contributes. Thus, some of these differences can be reduced or modified by breeding the mice in the same environment or by treating the mice with antibiotics to alter the microbiome. These differences in phenotype are paralleled by differences in insulin signaling at the molecular level. Importantly, the propensity to metabolic syndrome and abnormalities in insulin signaling can be transferred in part to germ-free mice by fecal transplant. Using non-targeted metabolomics, we have shown that these effects of the microbiome are associated with dramatic changes in the levels of multiple circulating metabolites, including both known and unknowns. The major goal of this project is to identify microbiota and metabolites which are altered by the changing microbiome and contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. The specific aims are: 1) Using our robust model of mice on three different genetic backgrounds, we will define how changes in gut microbiota, as assessed by metagenomic analysis, in response to high fat and high carbohydrate diets, as well as exercise, are related to alterations in insulin signaling and metabolic phenotype; we will also determine how host-genetics interacts with gut microbiota to affect the metabolome by microbiome transfer into mice with different genetic risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. 2) Define how changes in the community of microbiota and their metagenomic representation relate to changes in the plasma/cecal metabolome across all models, and how these contribute to the insulin resistance in these models. We will also integrate the metabolomics data to create complete metabolic networks. 3) Integrate metabolomic data across all models to prioritize the unknown metabolites linked to insulin resistance for identification; and determine how both the known and the newly-identified unknown metabolites linked to insulin resistance alter insulin signaling in vitro and in vivo. Together these data will allow us to define the role of the microbiome and its associated metabolome in insulin
resistance and metabolic dysregulation and how these interact with host genetics in this process."
10788354,"Toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic disease caused by the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This 
parasite has been infected nearly 2 billion people globally. In healthy individuals, Toxoplasma infection is usually 
asymptomatic or it presents as mild flu-like symptoms, as the immune system effectively keeps the replicative 
forms (tachyzoites) from causing illness. However, by converting into latent forms, Toxoplasma forms tissue 
cysts in the brain and heart that persist for a lifetime. Toxoplasma tissue cysts are surrounded by a thick wall 
which protects the parasites to available drugs and host immune response. Bradyzoites, the latent forms found 
in tissue cysts, sense the environment and can be released from the cysts and transformed into tachyzoites, 
which results in reactivation of the disease. This frequently occurs in HIV/AIDS patients, and it causes brain 
lesions that can be life-threatening. In healthy individuals, there is a correlation between chronic toxoplasmosis 
and neurocognitive impairment, as well as mental and neurological disorders. We previously demonstrated that 
neuroinflammation is one of the major factors that contribute to behavioral changes in Toxoplasma-infected mice; 
this was recently confirmed by another study that found that several amino acid related genes are dysregulated 
in the brains of infected mice, contributing to behavioral alterations and neuroinflammation. Auxotrophic for 
several nutrients Toxoplasma acquires amino acids from the host to establish infection, which affects the host 
cell metabolism and amino acid availability. We recently demonstrated that Toxoplasma depletes arginine in 
infected cells leading to host metabolic changes resulting in higher expression of host cationic amino acid 
transporter-1 (CAT1) regulated by GCN2. Toxoplasma infection induces not only CAT1 expression but also 
increases the arginine transporter activity, elevating the arginine levels of infected cells. While we have made 
progress in understanding the role of arginine during Toxoplasma acute infection, the role of this and other host 
amino acid availability during chronic toxoplasmosis has been frustratingly mysterious. Our preliminary findings 
support our working hypothesis that Toxoplasma modulates host amino acid pathways to establish chronic 
infection. This proposal will test the hypothesis that two-host amino acid metabolism pathways, GCN2 and 
mTORC1, mediate parasite persistence in the brain. Our experimental plan consists of two independent aims 
that will elucidate the role of amino acid metabolism during Toxoplasma infection in the brain and how amino 
acid availability contribute to behavioral changes in chronically infected mice. Aim 1 will determine the role of 
host amino acid levels during development of Toxoplasma tissue cysts in mice. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of 
GCN2 and mTORC1 pathways in neurological alterations during Toxoplasma infection. Resolving the 
mechanism underlying this observation will provide much needed insight into how the parasite causes 
neurological alterations putting us in a better position to develop novel therapies to treat Toxoplasma in patients."

Progress in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) depends critically on the
availability of large “trial-ready” cohorts of participants spanning the transition from normal through preclinical
AD stages, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to early AD. The PITT-ADRC Clinical Core has effectively
accomplished this, evaluating a cohort of more than 4700 participants since its inception and providing
participants, biologic samples, and data for a wide array of studies that depend critically on differing clinical
populations: participants at risk for AD (e.g. prevention, biomarker studies); participants with clinical AD (e.g.
GWAS of AD, GWAS of psychosis); participants with autopsy-confirmed AD (e.g. postmortem-tissue studies);
and participants with other dementias (e.g. DLB consortium). The Clinical Core has developed approaches to
maximize flexibility in meeting the needs of these diverse, and evolving, set of supported investigations. In
addition to its role as a critical resource for many funded studies in the PITT-ADRC, the Clinical Core will provide
participants that will serve as a focus for biomarker evaluation by the Neuroimaging Core and the Biomarker
and Neurogenetics Core. During the current period we have also maintained our strong history of
neuropsychiatric characterization of all participants and further enhanced our rate of autopsy consent, supporting
the Neuropathology Core and multiple affiliated R01s. We have continued our strong record of providing
genetic samples and data on large numbers of participants annually for use in local R01s and in national and
international consortia. Finally, we have added new investigators with specialized expertise in Parkinsonian
syndromes and FTLD and have developed new procedures to increase the rate of completed follow-up visits for
our participants. These accomplishments have prepared the Clinical Core to maintain its productivity in the
following set of proposed Specific Aims: 1) To perform evaluations at study entry and at annual follow-up of

The Neuropathology (NP) Core fulfills several
important roles within the University of Pittsburgh ADRC (PITT-ADRC). Postmortem neuropathological
confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders and the assessment of
co-existing neurodegenerative and vascular disease processes is essential to promote progress in diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of AD. Since its inception, the NP Core has collected and characterized >739 brains
from PITT-ADRC subjects at various disease stages. This resource has been extensively utilized for teaching
purposes and for research studies by local and national investigators to develop amyloid PET imaging agents
and correlate in vivo amyloid imaging results with postmortem findings, improve our understanding of genetic
factors contributing to AD risk and advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiology of psychiatric
comorbidities and neuroinflammatory processes.
 Our proposed approach to fulfill the diagnostic, tissue banking, research and educational roles of the NP
Core is outlined in five specific aims: 1) The NP Core will continue to maintain and expand a well-catalogued
bank of brain tissue samples and fibroblasts of ADRC participants and subjects from affiliated cohorts. A
special emphasis will be placed on harvesting brains from subjects with premortem PiB and tau PET imaging
studies. 2) All banked cases will undergo detailed diagnostic evaluation using the latest consensus criteria and
detailed characterization of comorbid and aging-related pathologies. Results will be shared with ADRC clinical
staff, families and uploaded to local and national databases (NACC). 3) The NP Core will provide
neuropathological skills and expertise to researchers and will expand its efforts to utilize digital microscopy
technologies and image analysis tools for identification and quantification of neurodegenerative pathologies.
The generated pathology endophenotypes will be made available for association studies with genetic
polymorphisms and clinical phenotypes such as the presence of psychiatric comorbidities, a major area of
research at the PITT-ADRC. 4) The NP Core will continue to participate in local and national research efforts
by providing brain bank tissue materials and neuropathology data from diagnostic evaluations. The NP core
will closely collaborate with other PITT-ADRC cores and projects in joint research studies and will engage in
NP Core-driven research projects. 5) In collaboration with the Research Education Component, the NP core
will leverage brain bank materials and expertise to educate neuropathology fellows, residents, medical
students and investigators about the neuropathologic features of neurodegenerative diseases.
 Through these aims, the NP core will provide precise diagnostic classifications of ADRC research
participants, enable studies of phenotype variations and broadly support efforts to improve our understanding
of the underlying disease processes."

Despite recent progress in the understanding of the biological underpinnings of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and advances in the treatment of patients with AML, fewer than one third of patients achieve a durable cure.
Therefore, deeper mechanistic insights into the drivers of AML that will lead to adjunctive, targeted therapies is
desperately needed. Recently, I elucidated a gene expression network regulated by the transcription factor
MECOM that is essential for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and that is hijacked in high-risk AML, but the
transcriptional and epigenetic co-regulators and essential downstream effectors of the MECOM network are
unknown. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that MECOM directly regulates a select group of genes by
modulating critical epigenetic pathways, and a subset of those MECOM target genes is essential for AML
maintenance. I will test this through a set of two independent specific aims. I seek to 1) mechanistically define
essential co-regulators and direct targets of MECOM activity in maintaining AML progenitors, and 2) identify
indispensable downstream effectors of MECOM to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities in AML.
I am an Instructor in Pediatric Oncology with at least 80% protected research time, seeking to apply insights from
stem cell biology to uncover and target essential pathways in AML. My career goal is to become an independent

of leukemia, and computational analysis. I have an outstanding mentorship team of Drs. Vijay Sankaran and
Scott Armstrong who have established track records of high impact scientific output and exemplary mentorship
of trainees, and who offer highly complementary areas of expertise. Dr. Sankaran is an innovator and leader in

10758578,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Achieving meaningful restoration of function after nerve defects are repaired is still a major unmet clinical
challenge. Due to disadvantages of nerve autografting, nerve graft alternatives are being increasingly used and
desired for defect repair. But clinically, these alternatives do not promote consistent regeneration and recovery.
Furthermore, we still do not understand what factors are critical to promote consistent nerve regeneration
across repaired nerve defects that yields meaningful recovery. To understand mechanisms that promote nerve
regeneration across nerve graft alternatives and functional recovery, we have used the clinically-relevant nerve
graft alternative, acellular nerve allografts (ANAs), as a model. Recently, we determined a critical role for the
adaptive immune system during regeneration across ANAs. We found that nerve regeneration across short
ANAs repairing nerve defects in wild-type (WT) mice was robust, while regeneration across ANAs in T and B
cell deficient mice (RAG1KO) was impaired. The ANAs within RAG1KO mice contained reduced Type 2
cytokine (i.e. IL-4) levels compared to WT ANAs. IL-4 expression was regulated via CD4 T cells and
eosinophils. And in IL-4KO mice, regeneration across ANAs was also impaired. Overall, we have evidence that
T cells contribute to nerve regeneration across ANAs through regulation of IL-4 expression within ANAs.
Therefore, in our aims we will (1) dissect which adaptive immune cells, including CD4 T cells, affect nerve
regeneration across ANAs, (2) identify how IL-4 expression is regulated within ANAs, and (3) determine the
targets of IL-4 that promote nerve regeneration across ANAs. In summary, our studies will reveal the cells of
the adaptive immune system contributing to nerve regeneration and demonstrate how IL-4 signaling promotes
regeneration across nerve graft alternatives."

Increases in protein synthesis during pathological cardiac hypertrophy places demands on protein-folding
machinery to avert the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins. Associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), where many important proteins are synthesized in cardiac myocytes, is a system that recognizes and
degrades misfolded proteins, i.e. ER associated (protein) degradation, or ERAD. We discovered a different,
non-canonical role for ERAD as a regulator of the levels of the growth-promoting kinase, serum glucocorticoid
kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 is a cytosolic kinase involved in growth of other cell types, such as cancer cells.
Interestingly, SGK1 can traffic to the ER where it is ubiquitylated by ERAD machinery and subsequently
degraded by cytosolic proteasomes; however, this unique regulatory mechanism has not been studied in the
heart. Our preliminary evidence shows that non-canonical ERAD could regulate SGK1 levels in the heart and,
thereby regulating cardiac growth under pathological conditions. We also found that an SGK1-binding protein,
called glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper protein (GILZ), can bind to and protect SGK1 from non-canonical
ERAD-mediated degradation, which we believe increases SGK1-mediated growth of the heart during pressure
overload. Accordingly, our hypothesis is that SGK1 is a major inducer of pressure overload-induced cardiac
pathology. During pressure overload, SGK1 levels, and thus, SGK1-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and
subsequent pathology, are increased by GILZ-dependent diversion of SGK1 away from the ER, which decreases
SGK1 degradation by non-canonical ERAD. Ectopic expression of an SGK1 peptide disrupts the GILZ-SGK1
interaction, increases SGK1 degradation, thus decreasing SGK1-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent
pathology. This hypothesis will be examined in mice subjected to pressure overload-induced cardiac pathology
in our specific aims, which are to 1-couple cardiac-specific SGK1 deletion with AAV9 encoding SGK1-WT
(active; ER-targeted), SGK1-KD (kinase-dead ER-targeted) or SGK1-∆60 (active; not ER-targeted) to examine
the effect of SGK1 and ERAD on overload-induced cardiac pathology, 2-combine AAV9-SGK1-WT or AAV9-
SGK1-∆60 with AAV9-mediated GILZ overexpression or knockdown to determine whether GILZ diverts SGK1-
WT from the ER and protects it from ERAD in the heart, 3-evaluate the potential therapeutic, antihypertrophic
effects of a novel SGK1 peptide that interrupts GILZ-SGK1 binding, and increases non-canonical ERAD-
mediated SGK1 degradation. These studies are significant because they will reveal previously unappreciated
roles for SGK1, GILZ and ERAD in pathologic cardiac hypertrophy. We will use an innovative molecular strategy
to mechanistically dissect roles for GILZ and non-canonical ERAD as regulators of SGK1 signaling and cardiac
pathology. Peptide-based disruption of the SGK1-GILZ interaction could be a highly specific method for inhibiting
the maladaptive pathological effects of SGK1 in the heart by selective degradation of SGK1."

The C-THAN Clinical Core will benefit from many years of infectious diseases-focused research and training
with clinical sites in Nigeria, South Africa, Mali, Senegal, and Tanzania. In addition to our key academic
partners, we will integrate many other international, national, regional and community stakeholders involved in
POC and home-based technology development across the partner institutions. Our overarching objective is to
develop a pipeline of POC and home-based technologies that meet the clinical needs of individuals with
HIV/AIDS and emerging infectious diseases (EID) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Investigators
will be required to demonstrate analytical and clinical performance of technologies as well as usability in low
resource settings. The Clinical Core specific aims are: 1. validate and establish protocols for innovative POC
and home-based technologies developed for the diagnosis and management of HIV/AIDS, HIV-related co-
morbidities, and EID in “real-world” clinical or community settings. 2. assess clinical user (caregiver and
patient) perceptions of device usefulness, acceptability within the sociocultural context, friendliness, and
comfort of HIV/AIDS and EID POC and home-based technologies, and 3. support translation of innovative
POC and home-based technologies from the Development Core into clinical studies though pilot funding,
expertise in clinical validation study design, and providing services including biospecimens with clinical data.
Our Clinical Core will continue to provide a “clinical laboratory” for innovators that will focus on validation and
user assessment of POC and home-based diagnostics on HIV/AIDS and EID. Depending on the status of a
developing POC technology, we will work across Cores to select projects to participate in either the Clinical

dedicated to clinical validation (from stored samples or clinical studies) and to evaluate clinical user
acceptability to ensure that the POC technology prototypes supported under this program have a high rate of
success for clinical uptake and maximal public health impact."
10761703,"Osteoblasts make bone, a dense extracellular matrix of mainly type I collagen and hydroxyapatite mineral
in an isolated compartment. Mineral deposition by phosphate production yields acid. Thus, osteoblasts must
remove the acid created by mineral deposition. Our preliminary data include direct demonstration that matrix
pH inside the osteoblast epithelium varies independently of extracellular pH in bone. Our work supports
strongly the premise that osteoblasts alkalinize the bone matrix, although gaps in understanding persist. Many
aspects of collagen secretion, phosphate production, and calcium transport are well studied, but proton
transport across osteoblast epithelium is studied minimally other than in our work.
 We will use innovative methods, membrane transport, live cell imaging of organ explants, and surface
plasmon resonance, to study the pH and mineralization of bone matrix. We expect to characterize components
of the osteoblast proton transport in detail, and to define clearly the nature of mineral deposition on the bone
collagen matrix. As we develop the molecular basis for these transport pathways we expect that molecular
targets for therapeutic intervention will become available to manipulate bone mineralization in vitro and in vivo.
Aim 1. Regulation of acid transport in active and inactive osteoblasts will directly address the hypothesis
that acid transport is required to maintain bone mineral, and that much higher transport activity is regulated to
allow bone mineralization to occur. We will study this by isolating active and inactive osteoblasts from rabbit
spine separating activie and inactive by size. We will measure the amount and activity of acid transporting
membrane proteins, as well as regulatory proteins for the acid transport process. In addition, we will produce
osteoblasts in vitro, following bone formation, isolating transport proteins from cells as a function of activity.
This will be done in normal cells and osteoclasts without and with over-expression of NHE1, ClC-3 or both. It is
expected that bone formation and activity will be stimulated by over-expression of these transport proteins.
Aim 2. Fluorescent visualization of live cell osteoblast proton fluxes will directly test the hypothesis that
vectorial transport of protons across the osteoblast epithelium establishes a pH gradient with extracellular pH
alkalinization due to the activity of the Cl/H exchanger ClC-3 at the basolateral membrane. Osteoblast secreted
matrix calcium and pH sensors with enable spatiotemporal detection of mineral and proton fluxes.
Aim 3. Parameters that affect mineral deposition on type I collagen will be determined using surface
plasmon resonance. We will use collagens that do (Type I) or do not normally mineralize biologically (Type II)
to explore the influence of collagen structure and the effects of osteopontin, osteocalcin and others to introduce
regulatory influences. Time, H+, Ca2+ and phosphate will be primary independent variables.
 We focus on novel mechanisms supporting formation of mineralized bone matrix, specifically acid transport.
These are important poorly studied elements of bone formation, and also potential novel therapeutic targets."

Infective Endocarditis (IE) occurs when bacteria or fungi adhere to the endocardial surface forming small lesions.
This invasive disease is characterized by a mortality rate exceeding 25%, is associated with extended
hospitalization, and often impairs the quality of life for those who survive. Early microbial diagnosis and
antimicrobial intervention are crucial to improved patient outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However,
currently accepted diagnostic approaches still rely on primary blood culture, which exhibits long and variable
turnaround times and can provide false-negative results. There is therefore a significant need for new diagnostic
approaches that do not require culture and provide faster, more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/IE, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies and characterizes these infections directly from blood in ~3 hours, without cultures. Implemented on
the RaPID (Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the
hospital, RaPID/IE incorporates a broad test menu including both bacterial and fungal pathogens, as well as a
marker of antimicrobial resistance. Crucially, the test is not compromised by prior antimicrobial treatment and
provides species level detail with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of appropriate antimicrobials.
Commercialization of RaPID/IE will provide timely identification and characterization of the invasive agent and
thus enable intervention with targeted antimicrobial treatment. This is expected to result in improved patient
outcomes and a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance.
HelixBind has met and exceeded all the Specific Aims defined in the Phase II SBIR. This included menu
expansion to cover antibiotic resistance as well as pathogens associated with IE which cannot be recovered by
clinical cultures, automation of the assay onto single-use disposables operated by a benchtop instrument, and
testing of clinical specimens. Clinical results demonstrate a sensitivity and specificity of 92.7% and 98.8%,
respectively. In addition, based on feedback from potential customers, the test menu was expanded further to
include coverage of pathogens associated with conditions sharing symptoms with IE. The disposable and
instrument were transitioned to manufacturing and extensive analytical testing was performed to ensure the
assay meets specifications associated with regulatory and market requirements.
In this CRP program, HelixBind will build on our success in Phase II to prepare for regulatory clearance and
market launch. This includes (1) development of analytical methods, based on FDA feedback, required to
successfully complete analytical and clinical validation studies; and (2) development of scalable manufacturing
processes for certain reagent sets to ensure 12-month, room temperature stability, of tests cassettes, and (3)
completion of an on-site analytical evaluation and blinded, clinical assessment study. Upon completion of this
project, we will be well placed to initiate formal analytical and clinical studies for FDA clearance of RaPID/IE."

To date, targeting the genes regulating intrinsic axon growth ability have produced by far the most promising
results in optic nerve regeneration. Recent studies, including ours, have provided strong evidence that neuronal
aging might be a key converging process underlying the loss of intrinsic axon growth ability of CNS neurons.
Indeed, many genes that act to regulate axon regeneration are also hallmark genes of aging (genomic instability,
telomere attrition, epigenetic alteration, and nutrient sensing, etc.). First, recent studies and our preliminary
results showed that c-Myc and p53, two well-known genes involved in DNA repair and genomic instability during
aging, act to support optic nerve regeneration. Second, our preliminary study showed that telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) was necessary for sensory axon regeneration in vivo. Third, aging is often associated with
decreased methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) and increased methylation of H3K4, resulting in reduced
amount of heterochromatin. In support, the level of H3K27 demethylase UTX increases during aging and
knocking out UTX in c. elegans promotes longevity. Our unpublished study showed that knocking out UTX and
its targeted gene, Magi3, in RGCs drastically promoted optic nerve regeneration. Fourth, the insulin and IGF-1
signaling (IIS) pathways, the key regulators of nutrient sensing, are the most conserved aging controlling
pathway in evolution. IGF-1 and many IIS downstream targets, such as Pten/PI3K, Akt, and mTor, are all
important regulators of optic nerve regeneration. Our published study and a recent study have shown that Sirt1
and LKB1, two important nutrient sensors, function to regulate sensory axon and spinal cord regeneration,
respectively. Foxo3, another key target of Akt signaling, has recently been shown to promote vascular cell
regeneration through Sirt1. Lastly, recent findings indicated that cellular reprogramming process can reverse
aging and rejuvenate the cells. Importantly, manipulations of several reprogramming factors, such as KLF4 and
Lin28, have been shown to promote optic nerve regeneration. Therefore, we hypothesize that aging regulatory
genes/pathways can be manipulated to promote optic nerve regeneration through rejuvenation of mature CNS
neurons. In Aim 1, we will determine if manipulation of miR-138/Sirt1, TERT, and Foxo3 in RGCs can promote
optic nerve regeneration. In Aim 2, we will first determine if combination of these aging genes with myosin II
knockout or enhanced neural activity would have synergistic effects on regeneration. We will then use RNA-seq
and ATAC-seq of purified RGCs to explore how these aging genes regulate optic nerve regeneration. In Aim 3, by
performing RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of purified RGCs at different developing, maturation, and aging stages, we
will first use advanced integrative bioinformatics analyses to identify top candidate aging genes and their
associated transcription factors, both of which act to orchestrate RGCs aging. We will then perform functional
screening experiments to determine their roles in regulation of axon growth and optic nerve regeneration."
10890883,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The Radiation Countermeasures Program of the NIAID is seeking medical countermeasures (MCMs) to
prevent acute tissue damage and chronic pathologies resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation from an
accidental or terroristic event. Radiation induces inflammatory cytokines that promote tissue damage including
Gastrointestinal Acute Radiation Syndrome (GI-ARS). Because there are no approved drugs to prevent GI-ARS,
there is an intense need for new drugs for therapy following exposure to radiation. Sphingolipids, particularly
ceramides and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), regulate GI epithelial cell survival, the DNA damage response,
and responses to inflammatory cytokines. Synthesis of S1P is dependent on sphingosine kinase (SK1 and SK2)
activity, and so SKs are rational new molecular targets to mitigate GI-ARS. Apogee has developed the first-in-
class Investigational New Drug opaganib (previously called ABC294640). Opaganib is the only clinical-stage
inhibitor of SK2 and has broad anticancer and anti-inflammatory efficacy in preclinical models. Phase 1 clinical
trials of orally-administered opaganib to patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma are complete,
and Phase 2 clinical trials of opaganib in patients with prostate cancer or cholangiocarcinoma are in progress.
Additionally, opaganib improved clinical outcome for highly compromised patients with severe Covid-19. To date,
opaganib has been administered to >470 patients with a favorable safety profile.
 Because GI-ARS is mediated by epithelial cell apoptosis and excessive inflammation, processes regulated
by sphingolipids, we hypothesized that opaganib will decrease GI damage from radiation exposure leading to
mitigation of GI-ARS and improved survival. In Proof-of-Concept studies supported by the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority and the Department of Defense, we demonstrated that oral opaganib
provides highly significant protection against mortality from GI-ARS in mice following irradiation in a 5% bone
marrow-shielded model. Opaganib increased survival when administered either prior to radiation or 24 hr after
radiation exposure and was efficacious at levels that have been demonstrate safe in human trials.
 In a pre-IND meeting, the FDA encouraged the continue development of opaganib as an MCM for GI-ARS
under the Animal Rule for regulatory approval. Specific requirements for approval were identified, and are
addressed in the following Specific Aims for this Phase 2 SBIR project: 1. Definition of the biochemical
mechanism(s) for protection against radiation-induced cell death and inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells; 2.
Definition of the effect of radiation exposure on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of orally-administered opaganib; and
3. Identification of assessable pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers for opaganib for future pivotal animal studies
and human clinical trials. The studies proposed herein follow FDA guidance for approval under the Animal Rule
and will enable continued advancement of opaganib as an MCM for GI-ARS."
10760219,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes.
Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is
recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and
the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved
Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention.
However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is
known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman
compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for
preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to
target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain.
Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction
tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative
effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance
claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a
subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in
current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In
Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with
non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in
two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine
practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms,
and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’
cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice
agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to
identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight
patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future
implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research
expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and
prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the
prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs."
10760220,"Additional sex comb-like (ASXL) genes are human homologues of Drosophila-Asx gene which encode
important regulators of gene expression. ASXL1 mutations occur at high frequencies in multiple forms of
myeloid malignancy patients with poor prognosis. ASXL1 mutations are mostly nonsense/frameshift, causing
truncation of the protein lacking the C-terminal PHD finger, which is detectable in patient samples with ASXL1
mutations. We have recently shown that transgenic expression of an ASXL1 truncation in mice (Asxl1Y588XTg)
results in increased HSC/HPC pools and pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies (Blood 2017). BAP1 is
activated by ASXL1 to deubiquitinate H2AK119 during polycomb protein-mediated gene repression. BAP1
mutations also occur in patients with MDS. Despite the significant impact of ASXL1 truncation mutations on the
pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, hindering the
development of effective targeted therapeutics. Our proteomics studies discovered that ASXL1aa1-587 exhibits
an increased binding affinity to BAP1 compared to ASXL1FL and gains an interaction with BRD4, a member of
the BET family. BRD4 is involved in multiple biologic processes, including transcription, DNA replication,
epigenetic regulation, and tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that truncated ASXL1 dysregulates HSC/HPCs and
causes myeloid malignancies through altering the function of the BAP1 deubiquitinase complex and gaining
interaction with BRD4. Challenging this critical question has great translational impact and is the major goal of
this application. In Aim 1, we will use our recently generated Tet-on/off Asxl1Y588XTg mice to assess in prove-
of-concept whether silencing transgene expression by withdrawing doxycycline can eradicate the ASXL1aa1-587-
mediated abnormal hematopoietic phenotype and myeloid malignancies. We will apply bPPI-seq, a novel
sensitive assay to confirm/identify the true ASXL1aa1-587 interactors at physiological conditions in vivo. In Aim 2,
we will determine the role of BRD4-ASXL1aa1-587 interaction in truncated ASXL1-mediated HSC/HPC
dysregulation and myeloid malignancy development. We will examine whether BRD4 inhibitor (EP11313)
treatment is capable of preventing and/or rescuing the abnormal hematopoietic phenotype and myeloid
malignancies in Asxl1Y588XTg mice. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of BAP1 in truncated ASXL1-mediated
abnormal HSC/HPC behavior and pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies in vivo. We will decipher how
ASXL1aa1-587 alters the function of BAP1 in HSC/HPCs in vivo. The effects of ASXL1aa1-587 on genome-wide
BAP1 and H2AK119Ub occupancy in LK cells will be determined by ChIP-seq and correlated with the gene
expression data. These studies are timely and fundamentally important for advancing our knowledge on
ASXL1 truncation mutation-mediated HSC/HPC dysregulation and myeloid malignancy development. The
success of this project will likely identify novel therapeutic targets in the gained-interactors for ASXL1
truncation, BRD4 and BAP1, for the treatment of myeloid malignancies with ASXL1 truncation mutations."
10932932,"CURED Overall Abstract
Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas
Southern University (TSU) are jointly submitting a P20 application to build a collaborative partnership in cancer
research, education, and outreach. DLDCCC is a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center. TSU
is one of the nation’s largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) serving underserved
populations and underrepresented students (ISUPSs). BCM and TSU have had several successful
collaborations. This relationship was strengthened recently through TSU’s U54 “Center for Biomedical and
Minority Health Research”, where BCM faculty have partnered closely on collaborative cancer disparities
community education and outreach. This P20 program provides an excellent opportunity for TSU and BCM to
expand collaborations. We propose a BCM-TSU P20 program “Collaborative Union for Cancer Research,
Education and Disparities” (CURED) that will foster strong collaborations utilizing our complementary strengths.
Overall objectives are to create a shared infrastructure that will provide an optimal environment for cancer
research, education, community outreach, and career development and diversify the biomedical workforce.
CURED was established under the direction of senior leadership at each institution, reflected in the significant
institutional support for this partnership. BCM has committed $160,000/year for four years in cost matching funds,
$ 50,000 for Pilot project 2 for one year, and committed funds to support the training of TSU summer students
in the Cancer Research Education Program. TSU has committed to return the Indirect Cost allocation amounting
to $98,000 each year. All TSU investigators are members of the DLDCCC. Leaders of each institution are thus
committed to empower the P20 partnership to address cancer health disparities among URM and underserved
populations in Houston. Our goals are to (1) establish a collaborative alliance between BCM and TSU for cancer
research, education, and community outreach. We will (a) establish CURED offices in both institutions that will
provide coordination for relevant activities, evaluate progress of current projects, and ensure a pipeline of
innovative pilot projects; (b) centralize institutional resources for faculty/trainee research needs (c) lead a cancer
research and career development program for TSU students that includes mentored cancer research, an
educational curriculum, hands-on training in emerging technologies, and professional development; (d) build a
BCM/TSU comprehensive outreach program to address cancer disparities at the bench, bedside, and within the
community; and (2) to support a pipeline of collaborative innovative cancer research pilot projects.
Overall Impact: We are certain that the proposed CURED will enhance cancer research education capacity at
TSU, promote a diverse research workforce, and improve BCM/DLDCCC’s effectiveness in developing and
sustaining research programs focused on cancer health disparities. We will develop sustainable research
capacity leading to independent and collaborative applications to the NIH/other Federal/Non-federal agencies."

Cognitive flexibility allows an individual to adapt established thinking patterns and behavioral responses to novel
situations that may require new approaches than those that were previously learned in order to be solved
correctly. Cognitive flexibility is therefore necessary to flexibly adjust ones thinking and behavior instead of
ruminating over thoughts and worries, or instead of showing habitual behavior that may not be productive to
effectively engage with a new situation or to solve a new problem. Impairments in cognitive flexibility can occur
as a result of chronic stress, which is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders.
Accordingly, cognitive flexibility deficits are common across a wide range of mental illnesses and often
unresponsive to otherwise effective medication. Moreover, individuals with high levels of cognitive flexibility have
been shown to cope better with day-to-day stressors, and to be less vulnerable to developing psychiatric
disorders. If we can understand the neural circuits underlying cognitive flexibility, we may be able to identify new
targets for advanced therapeutics to treat the debilitating cognitive impairments of many psychiatric disorders.
In this proposal, we will study a novel neural circuit component underlying one important form of cognitive
flexibility: reversal learning. We will specifically investigate how neural projections from the ventral hippocampus
to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regulate reversal learning and stress resilience. In Aim 1, we will inhibit direct
input projections from the ventral hippocampus to the medial OFC, and output projections from the medial OFC
to the lateral OFC, to test if this circuit is functionally important for reversal learning. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo
Ca2+ imaging of neural activity in ventral hippocampus, medial OFC, and lateral OFC, to examine for the first
time how neurons in these brain regions store, process, and update information about action-outcome value
associations that are important for reversal learning. In Aim 3, we will then investigate how these same brain
regions become dysfunctional under conditions of chronic stress, and if stimulating this circuitry can confer stress
resilience and counteract stress-induced deficits in reversal learning. Together, these experiments will provide
first insight into a new element of the neural circuitry underlying cognitive flexibility and stress resilience, which
has great potential to reveal new neural circuit-based targets for novel drugs or for advanced cognitive-behavioral
therapies aimed at improving cognitive flexibility in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders."

CAR T cell therapy offers new hope to patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies and has become
another weapon in the war on cancer. Despite the success and excitement around CAR therapies, sensitive and
universal CAR-labeling reagents are required for accurate CAR T cell detection and profiling in research,
industry, and in the clinic. To improve CAR T cell therapy efficacy, scientists, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical
industry need accurate and multifunctional CAR-staining reagents to perform downstream assays, conduct
preclinical studies, profile patient biospecimens, and develop new CARs. To overcome this technology gap, we
developed antigen-multimers – high-avidity CAR detection reagents. Akin to conventional MHC multimers, our
preliminary data demonstrate that antigen-multimers sensitively and specifically detect CD19-directed CAR T
cells in commercial infusion products, in peripheral blood, and in tumor biopsies of diffuse large B cell lymphoma
patients. Furthermore, we show that CD19-multimers can be readily employed to isolate CAR T cells from patient
samples at different treatment stages for downstream flow cytometry and single-cell multi-omics analyses. In our
application, based on our exciting preliminary observations, we propose to test the overarching hypothesis that
antigen-multimers will enable CAR T cell detection and isolation and facilitate downstream single-cell analyses
of CAR T cells from patient biospecimens. Our antigen-multimers can be used to generate new knowledge
regarding CAR T cell function and in vivo efficacy.
 In Specific Aim 1, we propose to develop antigen-multimers for high-sensitivity CAR T cell detection and
isolation. In addition to demonstrating the flexibility of our technology by generating 4 different CAR-detecting
antigen-multimers, we will also develop approaches for simultaneously isolating and restimulating CAR T cells
from patient samples in order to enable downstream phenotyping and functional analyses.
 In Specific Aim 2, we propose to develop antigen-multimer-enabled single CAR T cell multicolor flow
cytometry and multi-omics. We will first use CD19-multimers to determine CAR expression, cell number,
differentiation, functional phenotype, and persistence of CAR T cells by multicolor flow cytometry. We will next
use CD19-multimers to isolate CAR T cells from responder and non-responder patients for subsequent single-
cell multi-omics analyses. Leveraging the experience of two investigators with complementary expertise in
immunoengineering (Huang) and translational/clinical CAR T cell therapy research (Kline), as well as the
UChicago Cell Therapy Biobank which contains hundreds of lymphoma and myeloma patient samples treated
with CD19- or BCMA-directed CAR T cell therapy, the proposed experiments will establish antigen-multimers as
a new class of CAR-staining reagents with broad research and clinical applications."
10764668,"Our research program aims to understand the relationship between macromolecular structure, dynamics,
and function, with a particular focus on large nucleic acid binding proteins. To this end, we use sensitive
methyl-based solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which is capable of probing
the structure and dynamics of proteins and their complexes with masses >1 MDa. We couple NMR
spectroscopy with other powerful biophysical techniques to probe structure and dynamics and then employ
biochemical and in vivo activity assays to better understand function. Our strategy relies on rationally
designing mutations to disrupt specific interactions within the protein/protein complex as well as naturally
occurring mutations found in disease states to ‘break’ the structure/dynamics/function relationship in order
to piece together how the protein complex works. Currently, our primary focus is the MRE11-RAD50-
NBS1/Xrs2 (MRN/X) protein complex, which plays a central role in the DNA double strand break (DSB)
repair response. The MRN/X complex is essential for detecting and repairing DNA DSB breaks, as well as
for signaling their presence to the rest of the DNA DSB response. Additionally, the MRN/X complex has
roles in DNA replication and telomere maintenance. Not surprisingly then, mutations in MRN/X have been
found in many types of cancer and in diseases characterized by immunodeficiency, neuronal and cerebral
degeneration, a sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and oncogenesis. To fully understand how the MRN/X
complex performs all of its functions, it is necessary to determine structural models in the absence and
presence of its various substrates. Indeed, structural biology techniques, including NMR spectroscopy, have
been used to study the MRN/X complex and have revealed a diverse set of structures. Though insightful,
these models have raised more questions about how the structures are specifically involved in MRN/X
function, the relative populations of these heterogeneous structures in solution, the kinetics for the
interconversion between these structures, and short and long-range allosteric communication within them.
In the next five years, our goal is to bring clarity to each of these questions by applying our comprehensive
biophysical and biochemical research strategy. In general, we strive to better understand how protein
complexes use a diverse set of structures and biochemical activities to perform and coordinate complex
biological functions. These proposed studies will provide an unparalleled view into MRN/X function in DNA
DSB repair."
10864803,"Project Summary
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by social deficits and restricted
and repetitive behaviors. These behaviors have been associated with impaired sensory processing and
sensorimotor integration. In addition, ASD is often comorbid with intellectual disability (ID) and cognitive
impairment. This is especially true of ASD diagnoses associated with one of several major ASD risk genes.
While it is well established that sensory processing is critical for cognitive function in general and learning in
particular, it is not clear how deficits in sensory processing in ASD may contribute to cognitive and learning
impairments in patients. I hypothesize that learning impairments in ASD patients stem from sensory processing
deficits leading to a disruption in cortical functional connectivity critical for learned behaviors. I will test this idea
by using a mouse model of major ASD genetic risk that shows a tactile instrumental learning impairment.
Importantly, learning deficits require the function of the ASD risk gene in cortical excitatory projection neurons
(see preliminary data) highlighting the importance for cortical processing in this phenotype. In addition, these
animals have a reduced cortical response to touch. In Aim 1, I will assess the impact of the ASD risk gene on
sensory processing in dorsal cortex by monitoring calcium dynamics as mice receive passive sensory
stimulation. In addition, I will manipulate the ASD risk gene in sensory cortex to test its autonomous control of
calcium dynamics and connectivity. I expect that the ASD risk gene model mice will have reduced responses in
sensory cortex and disrupted functional connectivity to downstream regions in dorsal cortex. In Aim 2, I will
monitor dorsal cortex calcium dynamics as mice perform an instrumental learning task to test the idea that the
major ASD risk gene causes altered dynamics of cortical functional connectivity. Furthermore, I will determine
to what extent putative mesoscale connectivity deficits in the mouse model predict learning impairments in the
task. Lastly, I will specifically manipulate the ASD risk gene in sensory cortex to tests its autonomous role in
regulating functional connectivity during learning. The impact of this proposal will be to understand the
neurobiological underpinnings of impaired learning related to a major ASD risk gene, which may serve to
inform the development of treatments for cognitive deficits in ASD patients. In conclusion, I am an excellent
candidate for a National Research Service Award Fellowship because of my background in ASD risk gene
research and the training in cutting-edge systems neuroscience tools provided by the Rumbaugh lab.
Altogether, the training and experiments proposed here will enable me to further our understanding of ASD and
lay a strong foundation for my career goal of running an independent research laboratory."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in the United States, and
is rising due to chronic liver disease and its associated sequalae. Currently, the response rates to current
therapeutic paradigms consisting of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remain low, and there exist an urgent
need for novel combinatorial therapies to improve patient mortality. Lack of response to current ICIs is mainly
due to a poor understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and how various HCC driver
mutations lead to specific immune phenotypes. Additionally, there currently exist no biomarker-driven
therapeutics for patient treatment stratification. ꞵ-catenin-active (encoded by mutated CTNNB1 oncogene) HCCs
represent approximately 26-35% of HCCs and respond poorly to ICIs due to ꞵ-catenin driving an
immunosuppressive TIME and limiting the effector function of lymphocytes important for anti-tumor immunity.
We have developed novel ꞵ-catenin-mutated HCC mouse models where mutant CTNNB1 is co-expressed with
either the proto-oncogene MET (ꞵ-catenin/hMet) or nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) (ꞵ-
catenin/Nrf2). These models represent 11% and 10% of all clinical HCC cases, respectively. Our preliminary
studies demonstrate that ꞵ-catenin potentiates tumorigenesis in ꞵ-catenin-mutated HCC, and that directly
targeting ꞵ-catenin promotes an inflammatory response driving anti-tumor immunity. Based on these
observations, our overarching hypothesis is that ꞵ-catenin actively suppresses the adaptive immune response
in the TIME and targeting ꞵ-catenin or its downstream immunomodulatory factors may improve susceptibility to
ICIs. To investigate, I propose the following specific aims, which will uncover novel mechanisms of ꞵ-catenin
signaling in the HCC TIME, aimed at developing precision medicine therapeutics. Specific Aim 1: We will
determine the immune cells activated following ꞵ-catenin inhibition, and investigate whether there is in vivo
synergy combining ꞵ-catenin inhibition and ICIs through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multiplex
immunohistochemistry. Thus, we will identify mechanisms of immunosuppression caused by ꞵ-catenin activation
in ꞵ-catenin-mutated HCC. Specific Aim 2: Based on our preliminary data showing interferon regulatory factor-
2 (IRF2) repression in ꞵ-catenin-mutated HCC, we hypothesize that ꞵ-catenin-mutated HCCs may be sensitized
to ICIs, or even show spontaneous tumor regression, upon re-expression of IRF2 as a result of enhanced
immune response. We will use synthetic biology approaches to selectively induce IRF2 expression at various
timepoints in tumorigenesis and monitor tumor burden. We will then use scRNA-seq on the lymphoid population
to identify cell types and states regulated by IRF2, and test combination of IFNg (which induces IRF2) + ICI as a
therapeutic modality. Contribution to Training: This proposal combines rigorous research training in liver
cancer biology, immuno-oncology, and advanced bioinformatic analyses with an excellent clinical education, to
aid my development as a future academic physician-scientist at the forefront of immune dysfunction in cancer."

Bacterial expression of cell surface-associated adhesin proteins facilitates the formation of biofilms. Dental
plaque is a polymicrobial biofilm of the human mouth that contributes to oral infectious diseases. Formation of
this dental biofilm is initiated by pioneer colonization, whereby Streptococcus species use adhesin proteins to
attach to the saliva-coated tooth surface. Among the many adhesins expressed by Streptococci, the antigen type
I/II (AgI/II) adhesin family is widely conserved and has been shown to mediate interactions with several host
molecules and other oral microbes. This proposal uses Streptococcus gordonii as a model to investigate the role
of AgI/II adhesins in host surface attachment and biofilm development. S. gordonii is an oral commensal that
expresses two AgI/II adhesins: SspA and SspB (SspA/B). Evidence shows that SspA/B is necessary for
attachment to salivary mucin 5B (MUC5B)-coated surfaces. Proposed experiments will investigate binding
between SspA/B proteins and MUC5B glycans. The variable (V) regions of SspA and SspB are expected to
differentially bind the O-glycans decorating the MUC5B peptide backbone, contributing to initial attachment.
SspA/B expression decreases, however, as the biofilm matures, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of
sspA/B is complex. Data suggests that after initial surface attachment, protein acetylation regulates sspAB
expression via the two-component system BfrAB. Therefore, genetic approaches are proposed to investigate
the role of protein acetylation in sspA/B gene transcription. Overall, these studies will show that S. gordonii AgI/II
adhesins mediate binding to MUC5B and are transcriptionally regulated by acetylation of the BfrB sensor kinase.
Findings may be broadly applicable to streptococcal AgI/II adhesins and may suggest new mechanisms to
control microbial community development in health and in streptococcal disease."
10906030,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) comprise a heterogeneous pool of membrane-enclosed compartments secreted to
the extracellular milieu of cells. Eukaryotic cells release a variety of EVs subpopulations that can be classified
broadly into two categories on the basis of their membrane of origin. Microvesicles are EVs that form by direct
outwards budding from the plasma membrane. Exosomes are EVs that originate from the endocytic pathway.
Upon fusion of a multivesicular body (MVB) with the plasma membrane, the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) are
exported to the extracellular space as exosomes. Exosomes have elicited broad interest as their intraluminal
contents (e.g. miRNAs, yRNAs, and tRNAs) are distinct from their progenitor cells.
An accumulating repertoire of evidence has suggested that EV-mediated intercellular propagation of miRNAs
plays important roles in various aspects of cancer biology. In particular, several studies have suggested that the
intercellular propagation of miR-122 through breast cancer-derived EVs promotes breast cancer metastasis by
reprogramming glucose metabolism in the pre-metastatic niche in vivo. Consistent with this line of experimental
evidence, our lab demonstrated previously, both in cells and a cell-free reaction, that the Lupus La antigen (La)
mediates the selective sorting and enrichment of miR-122 into exosomes derived from a metastatic breast cancer
cell line. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which the La:miR-122 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
complex itself is selectively incorporated into breast cancer-derived exosomes remains unknown.
In this proposed research project, Jordan Ngo seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which the
La:miR-122 RNP is selectively sorted into ILVs. In Specific Aim #1, Jordan will assess the efficacy by which a
panel of candidate endosomal receptor proteins (identified by unbiased proximity labeling proteomics) are able
to invoke the capture of cytoplasmic La into ILVs prior to exosome secretion. In Specific Aim #2, Jordan will
identify the domains of La required for (i) its unconventional secretion within exosomes and (ii) its interaction with
miR-122. In Specific Aim #3, Jordan will establish a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the selective sorting of
La into ILVs, allowing further biochemical dissection of this high-fidelity sorting mechanism.
Completion of the proposed research will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which specific
cytoplasmic constituents are efficiently and selectively packaged into exosomes, and by extension, identify
putative therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer and inform efforts to engineer exosomes into efficacious
delivery vehicles for therapeutic compounds and nucleic acids.
At the conclusion of Jordan’s NRSA-sponsored training, Jordan will have a rigorous intellectual foundation,
scientific independence, and a uniquely broad technical toolkit that will make him an outstanding candidate for
an independent investigator position in the future."

 If we understand the somatic mosaicism of healthy tissues and how this changes through
pathogenesis, we will be better equipped to screen for, monitor, and treat disease. Somatic mutations
play a central role in disease pathogenesis, from developmental syndromes to cancer, and there is growing
consensus that somatic mosaicism in healthy tissue influences fitness and disease predisposition. New
methodological breakthroughs enable the accurate detection of somatic mutations, mutation rates, and
mutational signatures. Establishing a biological baseline of mosaic profiles in healthy and diseased tissue can
facilitate the prediction of genetically-driven disease states and the optimization of disease management.
 By studying somatic mosaicism in healthy and diseased colon, I will gain insight into colorectal
pathogenesis and establish a research framework to apply to other tissues. The colon is ideal for mosaic
research, given its monoclonal crypts, elevated mutation rate, and well-studied architecture. There are also
significant associations between somatic mosaicism and colorectal disease: somatic mutations are causative
in colorectal cancer (CRC) and are proposed to contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These
diseases have well-established regional presentations, with distinct pathologies along the length of the colon,
such as “right” and “left” CRC and differently-clustered subtypes of IBD. However, the genetic etiologies
underlying these pathologies are unknown, given previous limitations in mosaic research. This proposal will
examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of colonic mosaicism in the context of healthy tissue and pathogenesis.
Evaluating mosaicism across the length of the colon will provide insight into whether region-specific
mutagenesis, either endogenous or exogenous, explains variation in regional pathogenesis.
 A preliminary study by Lee-Six et al. reported variation in mutational signature proportions across the
colon. However, this analysis was limited by its low sequencing coverage (~15x) and examination of a small
number of colonic subregions in a small cohort. By leveraging access to cadaver tissue and colonoscopy
samples in tandem with biological and computational advances, I will quantify mosaicism with greater
resolution and capacity for hypothesis testing. This proposal will determine individual and cohort-based
mutational rates by anatomic subsite of the colon and extract mutational signatures that indicate
mutagenic processes, such as cellular proliferation or microbiome variation. I hypothesize that midgut-
and hindgut-derived colonic structures will harbor distinct mutational signatures from unique mutagenesis and
regionally distinct mutation rates. These mutational landscapes will likely overlap regionally with the
spatially-linked findings of CRC and IBD, suggesting a role in pathogenesis. Completion of this proposal will
then serve as an ideal framework to examine regional variation and pathogenesis in other tissues."

can lead to insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, termed “metabolic syndrome”, and
that obesity is a major risk factor for leading causes of preventable death such as heart attack and stroke. A key
factor driving metabolic disease in obesity is chronic low-grade inflammation in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT).
A population of regulatory T cells (Tregs), with a unique transcriptional signature and clonally expanded TCR
repertoire, is highly enriched in the VAT and plays an important role in controlling tissue inflammation. However,
this population is significantly reduced in obesity, which directly promotes VAT inflammation and symptoms of
metabolic disease. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis (CH) is one
mechanism promoting a reduction in VAT Tregs during obesity. First, previously published data shows that
transcripts associated with CH are reduced in VAT Tregs following long-term high fat diet (HFD) feeding. Second,
preliminary data shows that Treg-specific loss of SREBP2 (Srebf2), the master regulator of CH, significantly
reduces Tregs in the VAT, but not in other tissues, at steady state and increases HFD-induced VAT inflammation
and insulin resistance. Finally, multiple subsets of VAT Tregs have been previously identified which differ in their
extent of T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion, and preliminary data also shows that Treg-specific loss of
SREBP2 alters the subset composition of the VAT Treg compartment, based on key surface markers, and
reduces antigen-induced expansion of VAT Tregs. Thus, this proposal hypothesizes that disrupting Treg-
intrinsic CH reduces VAT Treg proliferation by impairing TCR signaling and altering subset composition and
TCR clonal expansion. To test this, a unique TCR-transgenic mouse model containing a VAT-Treg derived TCR,
where Tregs preferentially accumulate in the VAT, will be utilized. Combining this model with ex vivo CRISPR-
Cas9 gene ablation and adoptive transfer, allows for the unique advantage of efficiently assessing the impact of
ablating genes of interest on VAT Treg accumulation. This model in conjunction with germline knockout models,
in vivo and in vitro assays, and single cell -omics approaches will allow for assessing the importance of cellular
CH in VAT Tregs. AIM 1 of this proposal will determine the mechanism by which disrupting Treg-intrinsic CH
impacts VAT Treg accumulation by assessing Srebf2-sufficient and -deficient VAT Treg proliferation, cell death,
and cell recruitment to the tissue, and by identifying the relative importance of cholesterol biosynthesis and
uptake for VAT Treg accumulation. AIM 2 will assess the impact of disrupting Treg-intrinsic CH on VAT Treg
TCR signaling and on the subset composition and clonal expansion of the VAT Treg compartment. Together,
these proposed experiments will determine how disrupting Treg-intrinsic CH impacts VAT Treg accumulation
and phenotype with a long-term goal of identifying novel mechanisms for therapeutic targeting in obesity."

Cochlear implants (CIs) are the standard treatment for adults with moderate sloping to profound sensorineural
hearing loss and enable sound awareness and spoken communication to a high majority of recipients.
However, CI outcomes that rely on high-fidelity spectral encoding, such as music perception and speech
understanding in noise, remain highly variable. One of the biggest contributors to this variability is channel
interaction, but the relationship between spectral-dependent tasks (i.e., pitch, melody, timbre, and speech in
noise perception) and channel interaction is not clearly defined. This study aims to manipulate channel
interaction via spectral blurring in adult CI recipients to directly measure the effects of channel interaction on
spectral-dependent tasks. We will also explore the use of image-based electrode selection as an approach for
reducing channel interaction and its impact on music perception. Given that our preliminary data suggest a
relationship between electrode placement and psychophysical pitch discrimination, we hypothesize that there
will be a negative relationship between channel interaction and music perception outcomes. This hypothesis
will be tested using a newly developed method of manipulating the excitation patterns of stimulation directly in
CI recipients to investigate the causal relationship between channel interaction and outcomes. This model is
advantageous over previous methods because it accounts for the effects of electrical stimulation, neural
excitation, and sensorineural hearing loss present in actual CI-mediated listening. Primary Aim 1 will
characterize the effects of channel interaction and the impact of spread of excitation (SOE) and electrode
placement on pitch discrimination in all participants. Exploratory Aim 2 will measure the degree of image-based
electrode selection benefit for CI-mediated pitch discrimination in a subset of participants. Collectively, these
data will quantify channel interaction effects directly in CI recipients and provide a model to enable more
detailed studies targeting potential uses of image-based electrode selection to improve CI-mediated listening.
More broadly, this research should help improve signal processing methods for how stimuli, such as music and
speech in noise, are encoded in CI stimulation, and lead to increased utilization of CIs by addressing CI
recipient-driven concerns for variable outcomes. The training program will result in the development of
knowledge and skills in: 1) auditory neurobiology and the consequences of sensorineural hearing loss, 2) CI
signal processing and its limitations, 3) administering behavioral tasks of music perception to CI recipients, and
4) programming and administering direct stimulation experiments. It will also improve essential skills in
grantspersonship, professional development, statistical analyses, and open science practices. Each of these
skills is critical to achieving the applicant's goal of becoming a tenure-track faculty member at a research-
intensive university with an independent line of NIH-funded CI outcomes research."

Women with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia usually undergo coronary angiography to diagnose
obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD); however, approximately 50% are found to have no
obstructive CAD (defined as <50% epicardial stenosis on clinically indicated coronary angiography) and are
falsely reassured that their symptoms are non-cardiac. Evidence over the past decade indicates that coronary
microvascular dysfunction (CMD)-related ischemia may be an explanation in such cases. CMD is associated
with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and an estimated 3 million women are
impacted by CMD. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can detect CMD by quantifying
myocardial flow reserve (MFR). However, therapeutic strategies are poorly developed in CMD, with limited
studies to inform clinicians on treatment of CMD. This therapeutic uncertainty results from the fact that the
underling pathophysiologic mechanisms of CMD are incompletely understood. Women with CMD typically have
a high psychosocial burden and their angina is often induced by psychological stress, which implicates
autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that in CMD women, sympathetic activation
during psychological stress drives coronary microvascular constriction. In this proposal we will test the
hypothesis that women with CMD have exaggerated sympathetic activation and abnormal vasoreactivity
to mental stress, which predisposes them to adverse outcomes even in the absence of obstructive CAD.
Three groups of post-menopausal women, ages ≥50 years will be compared: (1) symptomatic women with no
obstructive CAD who have CMD (by PET-derived MFR < 2.0) (n=50); (2) symptomatic women with obstructive
CAD (n=50); and (3) asymptomatic reference controls (n=50). Both comparison groups will be age-matched to
the CMD group. We will assess cardiac sympathetic activity (using123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)
imaging) and autonomic nervous system reactivity to acute mental stress (Aim 1). Vascular reactivity to acute
mental stress will also be assessed (Aim 2). In addition to laboratory-induced mental stress, we propose to
examine the important role of chronic and daily life stress, negative emotions, anginal symptoms and autonomic
imbalance during one week of home monitoring using wearable sensors and a smartphone for real-time data
collection (Aim 3). Anginal hospitalization and quality of life will be assessed at 12 months of follow-up, along
with MACE. Accomplishing these aims will provide the critically important missing link of whether exaggerated
sympathetic activity is predominant in women with CMD. Findings from this work will inform future intervention
efforts centered on the utility of ANS modulation for the management of this high-risk, understudied patient group."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one the most common life-shortening single gene defective disorders with over 70,000
cases worldwide. Mortality of CF patients has significantly decreased over the last decades and we are facing
new treatment challenges for an aging CF population. While CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
modulator therapy is effective for many CF manifestations, airway inflammation as a hallmark of CF lung disease
is not consistently impacted leading to impaired mucus clearance and susceptibility to chronic airway infections.
Therefore, it is of great interest to identify novel therapeutic approaches that improve CF-associated chronic
inflammation, mucociliary dysfunction and recurrent infections to be ultimately applicable for all CF patients. We
have recently published that Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling, a well characterized pro-inflammatory
and aging signaling pathway, is activated in CF lung disease. We hypothesize that FGF receptor (FGFR)
inhibition will attenuate CF-associated inflammation and impaired mucociliary clearance. We will test our
hypothesis by employing a multidisciplinary approach combining cell culture with animal models including a
chronic airway infection model.
Aim 1 will establish the effects of FGFR inhibition in vitro on airway inflammation and mucociliary clearance in
the human CF lung using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, cultured at the air liquid interface from different
CF genotypes. The in vivo Aim 2 will recapitulate these findings in established CF rat models and assess
FGFR inhibition and its impact on CF-associated inflammation, muco-obstructive disease and lung function.
Aim 3 will further establish FGFR modulation in the chronically infected CF lung in vivo.
The overall aim of this proposal is to establish the role of FGFR modulation in CF associated lung
complications as an amenable therapeutic target to ultimately improve functional outcomes, quality of life,
and long-term survival in the growing population of aging individuals with CF."

Regulated proteolysis controls the quality and quantity of proteins. In bacteria, energy dependent proteases
eliminate aberrant proteins by recognizing distinctive marks arising from failed quality control, such as
incorrectly exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins or specific tags attached upon prolonged translational
arrest. These same machines control levels and dynamics of native folded proteins often through recruiting
auxiliary factors to increase selectivity. In this proposed work, we focus on two major energy dependent
proteases systems that are conserved in bacteria where understanding of their mechanistic regulation and
scope is incomplete. The ClpXP protease selectively degrades major regulators during the Caulobacter cell
cycle driven by a dedicated hierarchy adaptors and processes replication factors. Illuminating the molecular
details of how adaptors deliver these substrates will reveal rules of specificity crucial for understanding
programmed degradation. Similarly, the allosteric regulation of the Lon quality control protease by ligands or
substrates is important for its function as a quality control protease, with emerging models suggesting that
dynamic conformational changes can modulate specificity. In addition, findings that Lon can selectively remove
DNA bound proteins support new regulatory roles for this highly conserved protease. By using proteomics,
transposon-sequencing, biochemistry, and genetics to understand how bacteria govern the specificity and
activity of these proteases at a mechanistic and cellular level, we will gain critical insight into pathways that
control normal growth and stress responses in all bacteria."
10766148,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Toxoplasma gondii is a common parasite of animals and frequent cause of accidental infection in humans.
Acute infections are generally controlled by the immune response, but persistent chronic infection ensues due
to survival of semi-dormant stages called bradyzoites that reside within tissue cysts. In immunocompromised
patients, rupture of the tissue cysts releases bradyzoites that can convert back to rapidly replicating
tachyzoites, a process that goes unrestricted due to decreased T-cell immunity. The potential for reactivation
presents a continued risk to immunocompromised patients due to the fact that neither the immune system nor
antibiotics can eradicate chronic infections. As such, there is still a need to understand fundamental
mechanisms of pathogenicity in order to develop more effective interventions. One of the key mediators of
innate and adaptive immunity to T. gondii is the production of interferons that activate cells to control the
parasite through a variety of mechanisms including nutrient depletion, targeting the parasitophorous vacuole
for destruction, or growth inhibition. As one of the world's most successful parasites, it is not surprising that T.
gondii has developed active mechanisms to block these immune control pathways. Our studies seek to define
the molecular bases of how T. gondii blocks or subverts interferon signaling to overcome host defenses. In the
prior funding period, we identified a secretory parasite protein that traffics to the host nucleus where it binds to
the transcription factor STAT1 and recruits a chromatin modifying complex to block gene expression induced
by both type I (IFN-β) and type II (IFN-γ) interferons. Our prior studies demonstrate that the ability of the
parasite to block type II IFN is primarily important in the acute infection while its ability to subvert type I IFN is
key in the central nervous system during chronic infection. We have also recently identified a second secreted
effector that also traffics to the host cell nucleus and blocks the type I IFN pathway. The proposed studies will
explore the molecular mechanisms by which these effectors inhibit IFN signaling by bradyzoites and thus
assure survival of tissue cysts that are responsible for chronic infection."
10767269,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The regular beating of the heart requires the orchestrated expression of ion channel ensembles specific for
ventricular repolarization, pacemaking, conduction and other functions. Recent progress establishes a new
way in which channel expression is coordinated. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a
“microtranslatome” of interacting mRNA species encodes functionally related proteins, such as those
producing the ventricular action potential. These ion channels assemble cotranslationally into macromolecular
complexes that govern higher-order cardiac excitability. The aims of the proposal are to resolve components of
cotranslational complexes mediating cardiac repolarization using single-molecule fluorescence in situ
hybridization combined with protein immunofluorescence (smFISH/IF) in both embryonic (iPSC) and adult
cardiomyocytes. Hypotheses regarding the composition, stoichiometry and cellular localization of these
complexes will be tested. Whether such complexes regulate other cardiac functions, such as pacemaking, will
be determined. Mechanisms mediating mRNA association, such as candidate RNA binding proteins (RBPs)
identified with affinity-capture mass spectrometry, and direct mRNA interactions, will be resolved. These
studies are expected to illuminate new mechanisms by which cardiac excitability is controlled and identify novel
targets for disease and therapeutic development."

Neurodevelopmental disorders are common, debilitating disorders including autism, intellectual disability, and
perhaps even schizophrenia. Recent genetic findings have identified mutations in multiple genes in various
cellular pathways as genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders,
intellectual disability, and others. This proposal will characterize novel and innovative genetic mouse models
to delineate the function of these genes in the brain. Specifically, the proposal will focus on two genes
implicated in either 16p11.2 deletion or autism, both of which are predicted to be involved in overlapping intra-
neuronal signaling pathways and regulation of neuronal and synaptic function/development based on
preliminary findings. In addition to identifying the neuronal function of these genes in the brain, these studies
will identify potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of genetic forms of autism and intellectual disability
and possibly other neurodevelopmental disorders. Progress to date is substantial in that two novel mutant
mouse models relevant for neurodevelopmental disorders have been established and preliminary
characterization of synaptic function, neuronal development, neuronal biochemistry, and neuronal morphology
among other aspects of brain function has begun. Unbiased proteomic/transcriptomic approaches to identifying
additional, novel downstream targets of these gene products in mammalian brain will generate new
hypotheses anticipated to lead to additional potential therapeutic strategies."

Candidate: Austin Kilaru, MD MSHP, is an emergency physician and health services researcher who is
committed to improving outcomes for patients with acute cardiovascular illness through the implementation of
evidence-based care. To achieve his career goal of becoming an independent investigator, he seeks mentored
research training to strengthen skills in qualitative methods, causal inference, and implementation science.
Research Context: Each year, there are 1.4 million visits to US emergency departments (EDs) for acute heart
failure (AHF). Stable patients can be discharged from the ED after initial evaluation and treatment, but nearly
90% of patients are hospitalized. Evidence-based risk scores have been developed to inform hospitalization
decisions for AHF, given that patients may prefer to recover at home and the costs and outcomes associated
with hospitalization. However, AHF risk scores are not widely used. Moreover, they do not consider additional
factors that may be important to hospitalization decisions, including access to care, capacity for self-care, and
health-related social needs. Scalable approaches, like clinical decision support tools, are needed to promote
AHF risk stratification and supplement risk scores with additional factors that matter to patients and clinicians.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify factors that influence AHF hospitalization decisions for ED patients and physicians;
2) Compare outcomes for low-risk AHF patients who are hospitalized to those discharged from the ED; 3) Pilot
and evaluate implementation of a clinical decision support tool for AHF hospitalization.
Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Kilaru will first conduct qualitative interviews with low-risk AHF
patients who were either hospitalized or discharged from Penn Medicine EDs. He will also conduct interviews
with ED physicians to examine decision-making factors. Then, he will use electronic health record data for a
retrospective cohort study to determine the association of hospitalization with outcomes among low-risk AHF
patients, seeking to further test AHF risk score effectiveness and inform implementation strategies. Finally, he
will design and implement a clinical decision support tool, based in the electronic health record (EHR), among
ED physicians at Penn Medicine, evaluating outcomes including acceptability, adoption, and feasibility.
Career Development Plan: Working closely with his mentorship team, Dr. Kilaru will pursue didactics,
seminars, and individualized instruction to complete his training goals, which are to 1) expand skills in
qualitative methods to focus on patients and clinicians 2) apply causal inference techniques to analyze EHR
data, and 3) gain implementation science expertise to design and test innovations in care delivery.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine offer an ideal environment to pursue this
training and research. Dr. Kilaru will succeed because of the support of an experienced and dedicated
mentorship team, outstanding research infrastructure, and extensive resources for professional development."
10781155,"Traditional physiologic paradigms focus on 2 fluid compartments, intracellular volume (ICV) and
extracellular volume (ECV), in addition to renal sodium (Na) handling to explain Na and water homeostasis. A
potential 3rd compartment, where Na is stored without an osmotic effect on ICV or ECV, has recently been
popularized. However, this candidate 3rd compartment does not invalidate traditional physiology; it remains true
that Na loading will predictably influence ICV/ECV and the kidney will excrete the overwhelming majority of
loaded Na. Since only a small fraction of the variance in Na handling can be attributable to the candidate 3rd
compartment, measurement error (or measurement omission) of traditional physiologic parameters can be of
similar or greater magnitude to the 3rd compartment signal. Likely as a result, essentially the same salt loading
rodent experiment has been published multiple times often with different results/conclusions. Notwithstanding
the difficulty in studying this question, if a 3rd compartment does meaningfully contribute to Na/water
homeostasis, revolutionary biologic and therapeutic insights could be gained by understanding it. However,
before we can understand a 3rd compartment, we first need to definitively prove it exists.
 We propose a comprehensive set of porcine and human studies that will definitively answer 3
primary questions 1) Can a stoichiometrically relevant amount of NaCl be acutely stored or released
without water? 2) Is this storage location primarily intracellular or extracellular? 3) Does this
physiology apply to humans? Specifically, Aim 1 will establish if significant acutely mobilizable non-ECV
sodium storage occurs. We will administer large amounts of NaCl (without significant water) to nephrectomized
otherwise normal pigs and measure the change in total ECV osms compared to equal osmolar mannitol, which
is known to distribute into ECV and not a 3rd compartment. We will also remove large amounts of Na (without
significant water) via peritoneal dialysis with a sodium-free dialysate solution and determine the change in ECV
sodium as well. Aim 2 will determine if the non-ECV sodium storage location is primarily intracellular or
extracellular. In the above porcine models, we will measure 22Na storage in the skin (primarily acellular) and
erythrocytes/skeletal muscle cells (primarily cellular) between the NaCl group and a mannitol control. Aim 3 will
determine if significant mobilizable non-ECV sodium storage occurs in humans. We will conduct an ultra-
rigorous inpatient balance study with randomized crossover design of 10 patients treated with 5 days of sodium
free 5% dextrose (titrated to remove ~150 mmol/day Na without water) added to their standard PD prescription
versus a blinded control 1.5% dextrose commercially available PD solution (both minimal Na and water
removal). We hypothesize that 5 days of ~150 mmol/day Na removal will result in a large negative sodium
balance without significant change in ECV/TBW. Upon completion of this proposal we will have definitively
established if water free sodium storage occurs to a physiologically relevant degree."
10746415,"Patients with amputated limbs are customarily offered socket-based systems, which are stabilized by friction
contact between the socket and the soft tissues of the residual limb. Despite the leading-edge care provided to
patients with amputations by the VA Healthcare System, many abandon their conventional socket-based systems.
In a study of veterans with combat-associated unilateral upper-limb loss, 25% of veterans abandon their socket-
based prosthetics, with rates highest among women. To improve function and quality of life for these patients,
percutaneous osseointegrated (OI) docking systems are being developed worldwide.
The concept of OI is based on the ability of living bone cells to attach to a titanium surface and has been used
for decades to anchor common dental and orthopaedic devices to living bone. My research takes me outside
this paradigm. I engineer percutaneous OI devices, which require a load-bearing metal post to be connected to
the OI endoprosthesis, passing permanently through the skin to be connected to the distal exoprosthetic
componentry outside of the body. To date, the FDA has not approved the broad use of percutaneous OI devices
within the United States. Unfortunately, several OI devices have been experimentally placed into patients by
other groups using either unauthorized copies of European designs or using unproven modifications of devices
off-label. Without FDA approval, the broad commercial introduction of percutaneous OI technology is limited in
all healthcare systems.
The overarching goal of my research is to maximize the functional recovery and the quality of life of US Veterans
with limb loss. To achieve this, we need to bring safe, FDA approved percutaneous OI devices to this deserving
patient population. Since 2006, I have led the engineering efforts of a multidisciplinary team that uses a data-driven
approach to engineer percutaneous OI devices for amputees. We have followed a strict scientific approach with
the goal of achieving FDA approval for use throughout the United States. My pre-clinical work ranged from basic
bench-top science to numerous animal model trials, investigating basic principles of not only skeletal fixation, but
also infection prevention at the stoma created as the percutaneous post passes through the skin. With these pre-
clinical findings, we designed and manufactured a series of transfemoral percutaneous OI devices, we established
the initial surgical procedures, manufactured appropriate surgical instrumentation, tested the initial biomechanical
stability, and established the static mechanics and fatigue properties of the device. This pre-clinical work culminated
in approval of the first FDA directed Early Feasibility Study (EFS) of a percutaneous OI device in a population of 10
veterans with transfemoral amputations. Information obtained via the transfemoral EFS is now being used to
transition to a multicenter pivotal clinical trial for FDA approval and wide-range clinical adoption.
Since 2014, I have expanded my efforts to serve patients with transhumeral amputations because of their profound
functional losses and difficulties using conventional exoprostheses. We are completing the preclinical development
of this device, establishing the initial surgical procedures, manufacturing appropriate surgical instrumentation, testing
the initial biomechanical stability, and completing the design history file for submission to the FDA for consideration
to conduct a transhumeral EFS. While the Primary Aim is to perform an FDA guided EFS of a percutaneous OI
docking system for patients with transhumeral amputations, establishing its initial safety, the Secondary Aim is
to use a patient-centered approach to quantify the functional effectiveness of the OI device with targeted muscle
re-innervation to control the exoprosthesis. Information obtained via the transhumeral EFS will be used to help to
transition to a multicenter pivotal clinical trial for FDA approval and wide-range clinical adoption."

The ability of cells to migrate in a directed manner is critical to a variety of biological processes including
morphogenesis, would repair, immunological response and cancer progression. A key feature of migration in
an in vivo setting is the ability to break through junctional barriers as a cell migrates across tissue boundaries.
This ability requires a distinct set of molecular regulators and requires manipulation of cytoskeletal dynamics.
We have developed the migration and radial intercalation of multi-ciliated cells (MCCs) and ionocytes (ICs) in
the skin of Xenopus embryos as an experimentally pliable model system for addressing the molecular
mechanisms involved as these cells break through the epithelium. Our data indicates that diverse regulators of
microtubule (MT) stability have profound effects on the ability of these cells to break through junctional barriers.
We have developed the molecular tools and imaging techniques to manipulate, visualize and quantifiably score
the ability of MCCs and ICs to migrate towards the apical surface and intercalate into the outer epithelium. We
will use these methods to address: (1) Role of microtubules in promoting apical insertion, (2) Molecular
and physical regulators of vertex strength. The results from these experiments will provide a detailed
molecular mechanism for the complex regulation of MT dynamics during migration and intercalation. While many
of these experiments build on migration studies in cell culture, our preliminary data indicates that the in vivo 3
dimensional aspect of our proposed experiments will provide a novel paradigm for understanding this important
biological problem. The ability to block cells from traversing junctional barriers could have a significant impact
on human health as the ability of metastatic cancers cells to migrate through tissue barriers is a critical step in
cancer progression. The unique ability to address the issue of intercalation in distinct cells types will allow us to
identify core components of the process. Additionally, the profound reproducibility of intercalation during a
discreet developmental window will allow us to identify subtle phenotypes in a quantifiably robust manner that
would not be feasible in many other experimental systems."

Pesticide exposures are a significant risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s
disease (PD). Sporadic PD, with no known etiology accounts for ~90% of disease incidences, as highly penetrant
genetic risks are not very prevalent. Experimental models have largely elucidated molecular mechanisms of
pesticide exposures directly on those neurons vulnerable during PD. For instance, exposures to rotenone and
MPTP are used to induce nigrostriatal neuron loss in rodents. While the effects of these exposures on the central
nervous system (CNS) have been explored, outcomes of PD-relevant exposures in peripheral organs, such as
the intestine, are largely unknown. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions, such as constipation and inflammatory
bowel disease often precede PD diagnosis, and loss of GI innervation appears prior to CNS pathology in some
PD-predisposed populations. It is likely that GI pathologies may signal the onset of CNS dysfunctions in PD.
Within the GI tract, alterations to the microbiome (i.e. dysbiosis) are established to arise during PD, and specific
alterations to bacterial taxa correlate with disease severity. Dysbiosis is not simply an epiphenomenon, but has
physiological impacts on the host, particularly in the context of PD. Intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis are
sufficient to exacerbate CNS pathology and motor dysfunctions in animal models of PD. Intriguingly, the PD-
derived microbiome is enriched for bacterial genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, indicating that pesticide
exposures shape the GI environment. We therefore predict that dysbiosis, resultant from pesticide exposure,
impacts PD-relevant GI and CNS pathologies. Here, we will use germ-free (GF) mice as tool to determine
microbiome contributions to pesticide-induced pathologies. Most importantly, we will identify the contributions of
dysbiosis to established nigrostriatal dysfunctions that arise following pesticide exposure. Combining microbial
effects with relevant toxicant exposure, we will test the interaction of these external influences in a transgenic
mouse model of PD. This proposed project will bridge a gap in our understanding of how exposure to
environmental toxicants influences neurodegenerative outcomes. We hypothesize intestinal pyrethroid exposure
impacts microbiome architecture, which modulates inflammatory responses, and exacerbates PD-relevant
outcomes in the GI and nigrostriatal system. This project will provide a foundation for uncovering microbe-
environment interactions that modulate risk of neurodegenerative disease."

Abstract
Digital mental health (DMH) is the use of technology to improve population well-being through rapid disease
detection, outcome measurement, and care 1. Although several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that
digital mental health tools are highly effective 2-6, most consumers do not sustain their use of these tools 7-9. The
field currently lacks an understanding of DMH tool engagement, how engagement is associated with well-being,
and what practices are effective at sustaining engagement. In this partnership between Mental Health America
(MHA), Talkspace (TS) and the University of Washington (UW), we propose a naturalistic and experimental,
theory-driven program 10,11 of research, with the aim of understanding 1) how consumer engagement in self-help
and clinician assisted DMH varies and what engagement patterns exist, 2) the association between patterns of
engagement and important consumer outcomes, and 3) the effectiveness of personalized strategies for optimal
engagement with DMH treatment. This study will prospectively follow a large, naturalistic sample of MHA and
TS consumers, and will apply machine learning, user-centered design strategies, and micro-randomized and
sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMART) trials to address these aims. As is usual practice for both
platforms, consumers will complete online mental health screening and assessment, and we will be able to
classify participants by disease status and symptom severity. The sample we will be working with will not be
limited by diagnosis or co-morbidities. Participants will be 10 years old and older and enter the MHA and TS
platforms prospectively over 4 years. In order to test the first aim, we will identify a minimum of 100,000
consumers who have accessed MHA and TS platforms in the past. Participant data will be analyzed statistically
to reveal differences in engagement and dropout across groups based on demographics, symptoms and platform
activity. For aim 2, we will use supervised machine learning techniques to identify subtypes based on consumer
demographics, engagement patterns with DMH, reasons for disengagement, success of existing MHA and TS
engagement strategies, and satisfaction with the DMH tools, that are predictive of future engagement patterns.
Finally, based on the outcomes from aim 2, in aim 3 we will conduct focus groups applying user-centered design
strategies to identify and co-build potentially effective engagement strategies for particular client subtypes. We
will then conduct a series of micro-randomized and SMART trials to determine which theory-driven engagement
strategies, co-designed with users, have the greatest fit with subtypes developed under aim 2. We will test the
effectiveness of these strategies to 1) prevent disengagement from those who are more likely to have poor
outcomes after disengagement, 2) improve movement from motivation to volition and, 3) enhance optimal dose
of DMH engagement and consequently improve mental health outcomes. These data will be analyzed using
longitudinal mixed effects models with effect coding to estimate the effectiveness of each strategy on client
engagement behavior and mental health outcomes."

 RNA chemical modifications, collectively referred to as the “epitranscriptome”, have recently emerged
as a novel layer of molecular control of gene expression. Most epitranscriptomic studies address N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) of mRNA in human cancers. The molecular identity of endothelial mRNA
epitranscriptome and its potential role in regulating vascular functions remains a major knowledge gap.
 Recent studies suggested that mammalian mRNAs are broadly chemically modified and mRNA
modifications occur in a cell-type and cell-state dependent manner. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most
abundant internal (outside of the 5’ cap) methylation in mammalian mRNA, has been linked to critical biological
processes such as proliferation, development, and stem cell differentiation. Only few recent studies addressed
the potential role of mRNA m6A in cardiomyocyte remodeling and endothelial activation. We recently
discovered the presence of a new chemical modification, N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in mammalian mRNA.
Systematic m7G mapping in endothelial mRNA and its potential role in vascular pathophysiology is an
unexplored territory.
 Vascular endothelium is dynamically regulated by blood flow via mechano-transduction mechanisms.
Endothelial activation by disturbed flow contributes to a wide range of vascular diseases. Atherosclerosis
preferentially develops in arterial sites where endothelium is activated by local disturbed flow whereas
unidirectional flow promotes endothelial health. Current atherosclerosis therapies mainly target systematic risk
factors but not the vasculature per se. This underscores the significance and unique opportunity to identify and
target novel mechanosensitive mechanisms in vascular endothelium.
 We have generated very strong data demonstrating that the mRNA m7G is dynamically regulated in
endothelium by hemodynamics. Unidirectional flow (UF) markedly increases m7G but not m6A in endothelial
mRNAs. Moreover, Methyltransferase-Like 7A (METTL7A) is a novel m7G writer governing the UF-induced
mRNA m7G methylation in endothelium. The overall goal of this project is to delineate the novel molecular
mechanisms by which mechano-sensitive METTL7A governs endothelial mRNA m7G and regulates vascular
functions in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we will devise innovative precision nanomedicine approaches targeting
METTL7A-mediated pathways to treat atherosclerosis."

 α1-antitrypsin deficiency (ATD) liver disease is one of the most common genetic causes of liver disease
in children and adults. The only currently available treatment is liver transplantation. The pathobiology of the
liver disease begins with a point mutation in α1-antitrypsin (AT), one of the most abundant secretory
glycoproteins of the liver. The variant, α1-antitrypsin Z (ATZ), is prone to misfolding and that leads to its
accumulation within the early part of the secretory pathway of liver cells. Most of the ATZ accumulates in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as polymers and aggregates, and we now know that it is this accumulation of
polymerogenic, aggregation-prone ATZ that initiates the process of liver damage by a gain-of-toxic function
mechanism. Very little is known about the pathobiological steps after accumulation of ATZ that result in liver
damage but it is assumed that liver cell function becomes impaired with stereotypical fibrogenic consequences.
Marked alterations of mitochondria have been observed in liver cells of human ATD patients and the PiZ
mouse model of ATD, leading to speculation that mitochondrial dysfunction is at least part of the final steps in
the demise of liver cell function that characterizes severe ATD liver disease.
 Over the years we have learned that only a sub-group of homozygotes for ATZ develop progressive
liver disease and the majority completely escape clinical effects. This observation has led to the recognition
that genetic and environmental modifiers play an important role in the pathobiological effects of ATZ. Work led
by the Perlmutter laboratory has shown that the intracellular degradation pathway known as autophagy is a key
determinant of ATZ accumulation in liver cells and that drugs which enhance the autophagic degradation of
ATZ decrease hepatic fibrosis in animal models, including the ATZ nematode and PiZ mouse models. Other
recent studies have shown specificity for the molecular pathways involved in autophagy of specific organelles,
and the term `ER-phagy' has recently been recognized as at least part of the process by which ATZ is
specifically degraded. Furthermore, a very important new study has shown that at least one ER-phagy pathway
is regulated by oxidative phosphorylation genes and mitochondrial function.
 Based on these considerations and new preliminary data described in the proposal, we now believe
that mitochondrial impairment is a key part of the pathobiology of ATD liver disease in two ways, impaired liver
cell energy metabolism and reduced autophagic response, and, therein, that mitochondrial function is a very
appealing target for potential therapeutic interventions. In this grant we propose to investigate the effects of
ATZ accumulation on mitochondrial function to better understand the mechanism by which liver is damaged
and to investigate whether mitochondrial function can be targeted for therapy.
 Our overarching goal with these studies is to provide a basis for clinical trials of human ATD liver
disease that target mitochondrial dysfunction."
10747371,"The 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic was orders of magnitude larger than any previous EBOV outbreak. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V, an EBOV glycoprotein mutant that came to dominate the outbreak, increases infectivity in human cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases infectivity, and to clarify its significance for Ebola virus replication and transmission, we have assembled a team that leverages NIAID resources at the IRF-Fort Detrick and the Genomic Center for Infectious Diseases at The Broad Institute. Aim 1 will be to investigate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases virion fusogenicity. Computer modeling suggests that GP-A82V destabilizes glycoprotein conformation. Mutations engineered based on the models will be tested for effects on infectivity, the reorganization of critical interactions as determined by molecular dynamics simulations, conformational equilibrium as determined by smFRET, novel assays for GP fusion, Cryo-EM of GP trimers, and crystal complexes with the NPC1 C-loop. Aim 2 will be to assess the effect of GP-A82V in the context of the EBOV Makona variant on infectivity in human cells in vitro and in humanized mice. We will generate a reverse genetic system for the ancestral EBOV Makona lineage and test the effect of GP-A82V on this background. Replication of WT and GP-A82V will be compared in U20S cells, in human dendritic cells, and in a novel humanized mouse model where the effect of GP-A82V on virus sequence adaptation to specific tissue compartments will be assessed. From these experiments we expect to clarify the significance of GP-A82V for viral replication and transmission, taking into account the genetic background of the EBOV and the species-specific effects of GP-A82V. Aim 3 will be to examine the effect of GP-A82V on neutralizing antibodies. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V is relatively resistant to neutralization by particular antibodies. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of GP, we will determine whether neutralization resistance is a general property of GP-A82V, or if this trait is specific to antibodies targeting particular regions of GP. If differential neutralization is observed with particular antibodies, the effect of these on viral titer will be tested in the humanized mouse model. We will also determine whether GP-A82V alters neutralization sensitivity to convalescent sera from Guineans infected early or later in the outbreak, and from individuals treated at Emory University. From these studies we hope to determine whether the antibody response to EBOV was different depending on whether a person was infected with virus bearing GP-A82 or GP-A82V. If differences in neutralization titer correlate with virus genotype it would contribute to understanding the factors that determine survival in an infected individual or the efficiency of transmission to people who come into contact with infected body fluids. Finally, these studies will provide valuable experimental tools that will inform our studies on GP structure and function."
10772981,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Tumor Biology Program 
The Tumor Biology Program is one of two basic science Research Programs of the Abramson Cancer Center 
(ACC). This Program aims to catalyze research within the ACC to advance an understanding of mechanisms 
underlying tumorigenesis and to identify pathways that will enable novel preventive, diagnostic, prognostic and 
therapeutic approaches to cancer. Since its inception in the early 1970s, the Tumor Biology Program has 
continued to respond to emerging areas and advances in cancer research. The Program is currently organized 
around three central Aims: 1) Elucidate the molecular and cellular basis underlying cancer; 2) Understand the 
epigenetics of cancer; and 3) Investigate the tumor microenvironment and metastatic progression. Members of 
Tumor Biology are highly interactive, collaborating intra-Programmatically across scientific topics relevant to 
each Aim including genome integrity, cell signaling, metabolism, and viral pathways, with an eye on cancers of 
highest burden or health disparity in our catchment area. Ground-breaking discoveries in Tumor Biology 
uncovered novel mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, transcriptional control of cancer drug 
sensitivity, epigenetic regulation of inflammation, novel mechanisms of androgen-resistance in prostate cancer, 
and immune evasion by viral mimicry. New targets were translated to the clinic in collaboration with other 
Programs for early detection and treatment. The Tumor Biology Program is led by new and energetic Program 
co-Leaders (PLs) Shelley Berger, PhD and Sandra Ryeom, PhD, who together catalyze impactful intra- and 
inter-Programmatic collaborations by a variety of innovative methods. The PLs are instrumental in recruiting 
new members, mentoring junior faculty, stimulating interactions and meetings among faculty members, and 
organizing conferences and symposia. Tumor Biology Program members play key roles in the training and 
mentorship of high school students, PhD students, MD/PhD students, and MD or PhD postdoctoral fellows in 
cancer-related research through their leadership roles in the University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Graduate 
Studies (BGS), MD/PhD program (MSTP) and NIH T32 training grants. The continued success of the Tumor 
Biology Program is evidenced by the exceptional scientific progress of its members, demonstrated through 
high-impact publications with multi-institutional, inter- and intra-Programmatic collaborations, offering key 
insights into the biology of cancer. Currently, the Program has 53 members from 20 departments and five 
different schools with total funding of $25.7M (annual direct costs) of which 20.0M is peer-reviewed and $6.4M 
is NCI-funded. The Program has 67 R01-equivalents. Since 2015, Tumor Biology Program members published 
617 cancer-related papers, of which 15% were intra-Programmatic, 29% were inter-Programmatic, and 62% 
were multi-institutional."
10773015,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis (TEC) Program 
The Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis (TEC) Program, which received a ranking of “Exceptional” 
merit in the 2015 CCSG submission, includes 17 members from six departments within the Perelman School of 
Medicine (Psychiatry, Medicine, Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Dermatology, 
Pediatrics, and Neuroscience) and from the School of Nursing and the Annenberg School of Communication, 
who elucidate how exposure to tobacco and environmental carcinogens cause cancer and how these 
exposures can be mitigated by risk reduction, intervention, and communication-based intervention strategies. 
The TEC Program is particularly focused on tobacco-related cancers, asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, 
and has a new effort in UV/light exposure and skin cancer. These research areas provide rich opportunities for 
inter- and intra-Programmatic research. TEC Program Leaders are Dr. Trevor Penning, an expert in 
environmental carcinogenesis, and Dr. Robert Schnoll, a leader in tobacco control, who together champion a 
translational and transdisciplinary vision for TEC. The scientific aims of the Program are to: 1) elucidate the 
pathways underlying exposure risk (e.g., risk factors for tobacco dependence; risk of environmental exposures 
for mesothelioma, lung cancer and skin cancer); 2) identify the mechanisms linking exposure to disease; 3) 
evaluate methods for exposure and risk reduction (e.g., tobacco cessation treatments; asbestos remediation; 
UV light protection); and 4) test methods of risk communication (e.g., tobacco marketing, regulatory science). 
The Program has 13 R01-equivalents. Program members accrued 1,642 subjects to interventional treatment 
trials and 2,776 subjects to non-interventional trials. As one of the two Population Science Programs, TEC 
Program members collaborate within TEC and across the Cancer Control, Cancer Therapeutics, Tumor 
Biology, Radiobiology and Imaging (RBI), and Immunobiology Programs and engage in population and 
community-based research within the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) catchment area. TEC also leads 
transformative educational experiences across Penn and the catchment area. Seminal contributions during the 
project period include illustrating the potential use of low-nicotine content cigarettes as a national regulatory 
mechanism to reduce smoking rates and identifying novel mechanisms by which petrogenic polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons in the environment are metabolically activated. The intra- and inter-Programmatic 
environment is facilitated by mentoring, symposia, working groups, and pilot grants. TEC has $5M in cancer- 
related grants (direct), of which $2.6M is from NCI and $4.8M is peer-reviewed. Collaborative grants include an 
NCI U54 Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (with Cancer Control), a P30 Center of Excellence in 
Environmental Toxicology (CEET; with Cancer Control), and a NIDA funded P30 PET Addiction Center of 
Excellence (PACE; with RBI). Members have authored 316 cancer-related publications (21% intra- 
Programmatic; 22% inter-Programmatic; 78% multi-Institutional) during the current period."
10773037,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Shared Resource Management 
The ACC Shared Resources provide access to specialized technologies, services, training and expertise 
critical to accelerate research productivity for the 324 ACC members. Each Shared Resource engages with 
ACC members, trainees, and staff to catalyze basic, translational, clinical and population science cancer 
research, provide user training and support grant applications for extramural funding and publication of high 
impact papers. Under the direction of Dr. Celeste Simon, Associate Director for Shared Resources, they are 
continuously evaluated to ensure that they provide cutting edge technologies and accessible, cost-effective 
and reliable services that serve the needs of the ACC membership. We propose the following three aims: 1) 
Support high quality Shared Resources that serve the scientific needs of the ACC membership and catalyze 
impactful research activity; 2) Ensure stability of and access to ACC and institutional Shared Resources 
through responsible fiscal management and over-arching usage policies; and 3) Determine the scientific 
priorities of ACC members and ensure current and future Shared Resources meet membership needs. ACC 
Administration works closely with ACC Leadership and Dr. Simon in assessing Shared Resources, overseeing 
management, and ensuring fiscal stability, cost-effectiveness and opportunities for growth. Fiscal oversight of 
Shared Resources is accomplished through a suite of applications (Path BioResource system), centrally 
managed by the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and ACC Administration. Strategic planning is regularly 
undertaken; user feedback and internal advisory boards for each Shared Resources guarantee cutting-edge 
quality. The percentage of ACC users for each Shared Resource ranges from 32%-100%; the percentage of 
annual budget support provided through CCSG to support each Shared Resource ranges from 7% to 34%. For 
the current funding period, we are proposing nine Full Shared Resources – ACC BioRepository, Biostatistics 
and Bioinformatics, Comparative Pathology, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting, Genomic Analysis, Human 
Immunology, Metabolomics, Small Animal Imaging, and Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facilities. Based on 
our strategic planning process and in response to members' scientific needs, two of these Shared Resources 
(ACC BioRepository; Metabolomics) are new, each emerging from Developing Shared Resources of the 
current funding period. One existing Shared Resource has been expanded in scope (from the Biostatistics 
Core to the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core). Two Developing Shared Resources (Small Animal Radiation 
and Electronic Phenotyping) are being proposed, based on ACC membership needs. ACC members can utilize 
over 75 Core Facilities at PSOM; 24 of these undergo formal review by the PSOM Biomedical Research Core 
Facilities Committee to assure quality. Through ACC support of Shared Resources, members have access to 
state-of the-art equipment and instrumentation, technical expertise, training and education, all designed to 
support innovative cutting-edge cancer research."
10773050,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CPDM, DSM, Women and Minorities, Lifespan 
The CPDM is the administrative home for support and monitoring of all clinical research conducted in the ACC 
regardless of the type of intervention or sponsor. The CPDM creates, directs and enforces the operational 
policies and expectations for the conduct of all cancer-related clinical research within the ACC across the 
University of Pennsylvania. The CPDM scope is of necessity broad, encompassing and implementing policies 
and procedures, education and training, supervision of data managers and research nurses, and oversight 
over the specialty clinical research units (CRUs) that are a vital part of our Center. The CPDM oversees first- 
stage and second-stage protocol review, manages our centralized clinical trials management system (Velos), 
performs monitoring and auditing of clinical trials, and manages the complex activities of our mandatory clinical 
research review committees. Key elements within the CPDM are the Department of Operations, Compliance 
and Monitoring (DOCM), the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS, known as the Clinical Trials 
Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee [CTSRMC]), the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), 
and Office of Legal Affairs, along with our disease and discipline-specialized CRUs. The DSMC is responsible 
for ensuring that all cancer-related human subjects studies abide by all Federal regulations and institutional 
policies as well as our NCI-approved ACC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) to ensure subject safety 
and study integrity. The DSMC complements yet functions completely independently of CTSRMC. The DSMC 
has independent oversight responsibility for all activated CTSRMC-approved protocols, serves as the parent 
committee for the ACC DSMP, and sets policies, standards and expectations for all aspects of monitoring, 
auditing and pharmacovigilance for adult and pediatric studies. Key initiatives in the current funding period 
include improved times for protocol activation (50% shorter compared to 2015), improved data tracking 
systems, enhanced operations of the CRUs, and a new leader and coordinator for NCTN trials. The result 
overall has been a 116% increase in average annual accruals to interventional trials during this funding period 
compared to the last (20% increase for treatment; 314% increase in non-therapeutic interventional). Ensuring 
the inclusion of Women and Minorities in clinical trials continues to be a central goal for the ACC, part of our 
commitment to address the cancer burden in minority and underserved populations in our catchment area. 
Extensive efforts during this funding period have resulted in exceptional representation of minorities on ACC 
clinical trials and doubling of the percentages of Black subjects enrolled on trials, now exceeding the 
percentage of Black patients seen at the ACC. Lifespan. The ACC supports participation of patients of all ages 
in clinical trials. Our CTSRMC will not approve protocols that exclude children or the elderly without a 
compelling rationale. We benefit from a fully embedded Pediatric Oncology Program that performs innovative 
clinical trials for nearly all childhood malignancies, with members who lead the pediatric National Group."
10773054,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Protocol Review and Monitoring System 
The goal of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to ensure 
scientific merit, priorities, and progress of cancer-related protocols. The ACC PRMS utilizes a first-stage review 
of protocols within disease- and discipline-focused Clinical Research Units (CRUs) and second-stage review 
by the adult and pediatric scientific protocol committees [Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring 
Committee (CTSRMC) and Pediatric Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PPRC)], respectively. The 
PPRC is based at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and oversees pediatric cancer protocols in 
accordance with the same ACC review guidelines and reports to the parent CTSRMC. These functions are 
coordinated by Dr. Roger Cohen, the Associate Director for Clinical Research, and Dr. Victoria Sallée, the 
Director of the ACC Department of Operations, Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM) – each of whom reports to 
and meets regularly with ACC Director Dr. Robert Vonderheide. The CTSRMC and the ACC Director have full 
authority to terminate any cancer trial at Penn or CHOP. Both the University of Pennsylvania and the CHOP 
Internal Review Boards rely on CTSRMC/PPRC for scientific review of cancer clinical protocols and require 
CTSRMC/PPRC approval prior to final IRB approval. CTSRMC/PPRC efforts do not duplicate functions of IRB, 
Data Safety Monitoring, or central NCI review bodies. At the time of the last CCSG review, our PRMS was 
deemed “Acceptable.” In the current funding period, enhancements to PRMS include further operationalizing 
our longstanding “first-stage” protocol review, following the guidance of the new CCSG FOA, as well as 
decreasing protocol activation times by 50% (such that the average time-to-activation is now 88 business 
days). The latter was accomplished by developing improved tools for data tracking and reporting, implementing 
sponsor Master Agreements to minimize budget and contract issues, increasing utilization of CIRB and 
commercial IRBs, and instituting reciprocity agreements with other peer PRMS committees. Specific Aims for 
PRMS are: (1) Support a first-stage review of clinical protocols at the disease- or discipline-level via our 
specialized CRUs; (2) Provide a second-stage scientific, statistical and feasibility review via CTSRMC/PPRC, 
which holds sole authority for approval of cancer clinical protocols, and (3) Provide continuing review by 
CTSRMC/PPRC of open protocols, including assessment of accrual, safety data, and scientific relevance, with 
authority to close trials for deficient accrual, unacceptable safety or scientific deficiencies."
10773146,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer metastasis to the brain is rising in prevalence and is an increasingly lethal threat to patients due
to the very limited treatment options and high mortality. Therefore, there is a great and urgent need to develop
novel preventive and therapeutic treatments for brain-homing metastatic cancer. Altered function of normal
cells in a metastatic niche has been recognized as an important means for cancer to facilitate metastasis. The
metabolic reprogramming of normal niche cells during cancer metastasis, however, remains largely
unexplored. The proposed project will investigate this unique aspect of cancer–host crosstalk from the novel
perspective of extracellular miRNA, whose function in transferring cancer-derived signals to various types of
niche cells to facilitate cancer growth and metastasis has been recently recognized. MiRNA negatively
regulates gene expression through inducing mRNA degradation and/or translation blockade. The goals of this
study are to identify the mechanism by which cancer cell-secreted miRNA reprograms the energy
metabolism of brain cells (neurons and astrocytes) to promote metastasis, to assess potential
therapeutic strategies to protect the brain using experimental models, and to evaluate the potential of
such miRNA as a novel blood-based biomarker for breast cancer brain metastasis. In Aim 1, we will
determine the effects and acting mechanism of selected breast cancer-secreted miRNA in the metabolic
reprogramming of brain cells and tissues, including a mechanism through suppression of nutrient influxes.
Mouse models will be used to elucidate how altered energy metabolism in the brain contributes to the stepwise
process of breast-to-brain metastasis. In Aim 2, we will assess the beneficial effects of experimental
therapeutics targeting cancer-induced adaptation of the brain as novel strategies to prevent or treat breast
cancer brain metastasis. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the potential of circulating miRNA as a clinical biomarker for
the prediction or early diagnosis of brain metastasis in breast cancer patients. We will also investigate
specimens of resected brain metastases for clinical evidence of the herein identified molecular mechanism.
The proposed project will provide a novel perspective to our understandings of the dynamic communication
between cancer and host and of the complex mechanisms underlying the development of brain metastases. It
may establish rationales for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat brain-metastasizing cancer and
alleviate cancer’s adverse effects on brain function, which is our long-term objective. Importantly, our study
may establish circulating miRNA as a non-invasive biomarker to identify patients with a high risk of developing
brain metastases, thereby enabling a shift of our therapeutic focus to targeting the prevention of brain
metastases."
10773147,"SUMMARY
Stressful life experiences are risk factors that play considerable roles in the development and maintenance of
alcohol (ethanol) abuse, excessive drinking, and relapse. Preclinical studies from the INIAstress Consortium that
examined chronic ethanol-stress interactions in mice have demonstrated elevations in ethanol drinking, cognitive
deficits, metaplastic adaptations, and emergence of negative affective behaviors. The INIAstress investigators
also performed mechanistic and pharmacological studies that revealed key biological targets that are responsible
for driving these aberrant behaviors in stressed, chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposed mice. However, the
brain-wide neural adaptations produced by ethanol-stress interactions are unknown, and a better understanding
of the brain-wide activity patterns that underlie alcohol and stress interactions will lead to effective strategies for
treating individuals with alcohol use disorder. Recent advancements in brain-wide mapping and innovative
network neuroscience statistical approaches prompted the formation of the CIE-Stress Mouse Brain Activity
Mapping Core (BAMC). In this application, we provide preliminary data showing whole-brain light sheet imaging
of c-Fos expression and functional connectivity mapping in CIE-FSS treated mice and in mice drinking in the
intermittent access model. Thus, the primary goals of the BAMC are to 1) apply cutting-edge technology in whole-
brain light sheet imaging and expertise in network analyses to provide investigators in the INIAstress Consortium
and the scientific community with novel brain regions, circuits, and networks that drive increased drinking in mice
with a history of forced swim stress (FSS) and CIE exposure, and 2) provide brain-wide signatures of immediate
early gene (IEG) activity in response to pharmacological agents that are known to reduce the excessive drinking
phenotype in stress, ethanol dependent mice. The secondary goals of the BAMC are to 1) provide the whole-
brain mapping data to the Computational and Statistical Analysis Core (CSAC) for integration with additional
neural and behavioral data collected across all components, and 2) perform cross-INIA Consortia analyses of
whole-brain IEG expression. In Aim 1, the BAMC will generate whole-brain IEG mapping data using the standard
INIAstress Consortium model of stress-induced excessive drinking for INIAstress investigators and the scientific
community. Studies in Aim 2 will determine brain-wide IEG signatures after pharmacological treatment of drugs
that reduce drinking in the CIE-FSS model. By applying cutting-edge light sheet imaging, advanced network
analysis, and pharmacological interrogation of IEG expression across the whole mouse brain using a reliable
model that results in escalated voluntary ethanol intake in stressed, ethanol dependent mice, the BAMC will help
to generate new hypotheses and unbiased insights into systems and circuitry underlying alcohol-stress
interactions. Finally, through its interactions with the CSAC and BRAIN Initiative investigators, the Brain Activity
Mapping Core will contribute to Open Science practices that will provide the greater scientific community with
whole-brain IEG mapping data from excessively drinking mice."
10773149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric condition that is characterized by chronic and
relapsing episodes of excessive, uncontrolled alcohol consumption. AUD is also associated with significant
disruption of brain function and behavior, frequently presenting with cognitive deficits and comorbid negative
affective disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression). These negative affective and cognitive disturbances that are
present during abstinence from alcohol drinking can drive relapse-like behaviors in both humans and rodent
models and are often exacerbated by stress. Thus, alcohol and stress may be working synergistically to cause
more profound cognitive deficits that lead to decreased cognitive control over alcohol consumption, but the
molecular and cellular adaptations and the neurocircuitry underlying these concerted changes are not well
understood. The ventral striatum, specifically the nucleus accumbens (NAc), mediates aspects of alcohol taking
and seeking, negative affect, and is one of the primary outputs of both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and
the anterior paraventricular thalamus (aPVT). These circuits mediate appetitive and reward-motivated behaviors,
are sensitive to stress and alcohol, and are involved decision making and choice behaviors particularly during
motivational conflict. Additionally, in both the mPFC and aPVT, pro-stress molecules, like corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF), are recruited and have been implicated in regulating responses to stress and/or alcohol. Thus, this
component of the INIAstress Consortium seeks to understand the mechanisms and circuitry involved in the
complex interaction between stress and alcohol exposure that engender such high rates of alcohol consumption,
cognitive impairments, and negative affective states. We provide evidence that the chronic intermittent ethanol
(CIE) exposure model and repeated forced swim stress (FSS) alter reward-choice behaviors under conditions of
motivational conflict. We also show that mPFC CRF knockout blocks the escalation of alcohol drinking in the
CIE-FSS model. The overarching hypothesis is that CIE-FSS hyper-recruits CRF in the mPFC and aPVT to
promote excessive drinking, cognitive deficits, and anxiety-like phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will identify chronic
alcohol- and stress-induced changes in synaptic and functional plasticity that occur in a CRF-dependent and
independent manner in mPFC®NAc and aPVT®NAc circuitry. Studies in Aim 2 will focus on understanding the
influence of CRF on mPFC function and circuitry using high-density silicon Neuropixels probes and fiber
photometry. Finally, Aim 3 will identify the role of CRF in the aPVT and its influence on aPVT®NAc projections
in the CIE-FSS model. The focus of this new INIAstress Consortium component is to understand the broader
implications of CRF modulation of neurocircuitry regulating reward-guided behaviors in chronically stressed,
alcohol dependent mice, which is critical to our understanding of the complex interaction between alcohol and
stress, and aid in identifying promising therapeutic targets."
10779134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a heterogeneous immune-mediated clinical
syndrome that is commonly triggered by lower respiratory tract infections. PARDS affects 6% of intubated
children, and ~1/3 of these children have severe PARDS – those with the highest degree of hypoxemia. An
additional 4% are at-risk for PARDS, and of those at-risk children, ~1/5 progress to PARDS. Nearly 1/4 of
PARDS survivors develop new morbidity at discharge, and ~1/3 of children with severe PARDS die. More than
40% of children who die PARDS-related deaths are previously healthy, very young children. Neutrophils are
key drivers of inflammation and PARDS-related lung injury. The transmigration of blood neutrophils across an
endothelial and epithelial cell layer into the alveolar space is a critical event in the transformation of a blood to
activation results in
the release of proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and weblike DNA-histone complexes called
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are a subset of nucleosomes that are toxic to many cell types, can
skew T cells to a Th17 (vs. Treg) state, and contribute to further lung injury in PARDS. The overall objective of
this study is to understand how neutrophil death promotes poor clinical outcomes in intubated children with
PARDS. This proposal builds on Dr. Grunwell’s experience with airway and blood neutrophils, metabolomics,
and transcriptomics in PARDS during her K23 award by expanding the investigation of mechanisms related to
neutrophil death . This study will be the first to compare blood and
airway samples each obtained at two times in the week following intubation and associate NETs with a longer
duration of intubation and/or death. The specific goals are to determine whether markers of neutrophil cell
death and/or a higher systemic Th17/Treg ratio are associated with poor clinical outcomes. The third goal is to
an airway neutrophil. In inflammatory environments, neutrophil apoptosis is delayed and
in intubated children at-risk and with PARDS
integrate transcriptomic (RNASeq), metabolomic, and cytokine data with machine learning methods to link
phenotypes with endotypes to gain mechanistic insight into the underlying pathobiology of PARDS. The
proposal leverages the existing expertise and collaborative infrastructure at Emory University and Children’s
Healthcare of Atlanta to strategically investigate newly discovered pathobiological mechanisms important to the
onset and progression of PARDS and to identify factors that account for individual differences in pathology and
response to treatments – to achieve the main goal of personalized medicine."
10746262,"Background: Every day, hospitals across the United States (US) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
discharge patients with vascular access devices for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). OPAT
has advantages but it is not risk-free and can result in adverse events and hospital readmissions. A high
degree of commitment and task performance by patients and caregivers is also required. A 2020 VHA
Antimicrobial Stewardship survey found variability in who monitors OPAT patients and that most facilities use
outside contract services, which may make it difficult to coordinate care across settings. OPAT is a vital part of
Veteran care, yet we know very little about how it is managed across VHA or the challenges Veterans and
their caregivers face while receiving at-home therapy.
Significance: This research will advance knowledge and improve care delivery by addressing VHA and
research clinical and methods priorities related to quality and safety, the use of cross-cutting methods and
real-world impact. This work is also aligned with VA strategic goals and core principles, including providing
Veterans with care in their homes when needed and the required training and resources for their caregivers.
This research will advance knowledge and lead to improvements in quality and safety, a VHA clinical priority,
by identifying and deploying strategies to ensure safe and effective OPAT delivery for Veterans.
Innovation & Impact: This study is the first comprehensive assessment of OPAT delivery in VHA. Findings
will lead to improvements in OPAT delivery and provide knowledge for improving home infusion therapy more
broadly. Focusing on the patient journey, we will highlight the interactions across different socio-organizational
contexts, providing a more complete view of care delivery. Innovative methods that actively engage Veterans,
caregivers and clinical providers are used throughout the research process. We will also use a collaborative
co-design approach to bring stakeholders together to develop interventions that are more acceptable and
feasible to implement. Methods that could be used to address other care delivery challenges.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess how OPAT is delivered by VHA Medical Centers, through semi-structured
interviews with clinical providers at selected facilities followed by a survey of all VHA medical centers. Aim 2:
Gain an in-depth understanding of the Veteran home experience using video-reflexive ethnography and photo
elicitation followed by a survey assessment of Veteran experiences with a broader sample of OPAT patients.
Aim 3: Design interventions to enhance OPAT safety and delivery in collaboration with Veterans, their
caregivers and clinical care providers.
Methodology: This study uses qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how OPAT is delivered
across VHA, how patients and caregivers experience at-home OPAT and a user-centered design approach to
develop interventions to address OPAT-related challenges and safety concerns. Our research is guided by the
Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 3.0 framework, which incorporates the patient
journey across various care settings. We will conduct semi-structured interviews and surveys of clinical care
providers involved in OPAT care, and video-reflexive ethnography, photo elicitation, and surveys with Veterans
and caregivers. Analyses of these data will be aligned with the SEIPS framework and used to inform the co-
design of interventions with Veterans, caregivers and providers to address OPAT challenges and needs.
Next Steps/Implementation: Outcomes from this work will include a detailed understanding of OPAT use and
delivery across VHA and an understanding of the patient experience at hospital discharge and post-discharge.
Top priority interventions to support in-home OPAT delivery along with implementation steps will be identified.
Protocols for using novel methods and co-design to collaborate with healthcare professionals and patients will
also be developed. Importantly, this work will inform OPAT related policy and practice within VHA."
10747360,"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and ranks as the sixth most common cancer diagnosed in women. Rising incidence of thyroid cancer is reflected by the projected 52,000 new cases in 2019. A majority of patients have differentiated thyroid cancer and are managed successfully with a combination of surgery and radioiodine (RAI) therapy. However, tumors may present or recur as RAI-refractory or metastatic, in which case they have a poorer prognosis and death is common. Among these, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), although relatively rare, represents a true clinical emergency: ATC is typically unresectable at presentation, highly resistant to therapy, RAI-resistant, and associated with a median survival of less than 9 months when patients are treated with multimodal therapy, and less than 3 months with palliative care. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation are generally ineffective in prolonging survival of ATC patients. Thus, ATC remains one of the most lethal tumors and needs novel, effective, and especially rational therapeutic approaches. The major obstacle to this goal is the lack of a detailed understanding of the pathways altered both in the early stages (drivers) and during progression of ATC. As the patient population is small, our mechanistic knowledge is based on the retrospective analysis of patient material and on cell lines often of dubious origin. We now know that TP53 is lost or mutated in 70% of ATCs, and that in almost 40% the PI3K cascade is constitutively activated. Additional common drivers include BRAF (40%) and RAS (27%) activating mutations. Despite this knowledge, it is increasingly clear that we are still missing a comprehensive wiring chart depicting all the
interactions between different, cooperating driver pathways. Such detailed map is of paramount importance to design effective multidrug combinations that consider less known signaling conduits, mechanisms of resistance, and feedback pathway activation. The current application has two broad, long-term objectives. The first goal is to utilize a combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approaches to test the hypothesis that activation and/or overexpression of the SGK1 protein kinase are integral and essential components of the neoplastic transformation process initiated by constitutive activation of PI3K, RAS, and SRC in thyroid epithelial cells and that SGK1 targeting is essential for effective inhibition of tumor growth. The second objective is to use genetically engineered mouse models, as well as cell culture approaches, to test the hypothesis that mutations in mTORC1-activating pathways, including loss of NF2 and activation of PI3K signaling, cooperate with oncogenic RAS by contributing crucial signals needed for RAS-mediated transformation of thyroid epithelial cells. This genetic interaction opens a window of opportunity for targeted
therapeutic approaches."
10778641,"Project summary: The goal of Core B (Structural Connections Core) is to provide support for mapping brain
pathways relevant to the OCD network, in non-human primates and human subjects. This involves bridging
between projects to translate information from anatomical tracing studies to neuroimaging studies that utilize
diffusion MRI. The first aim of Core B is to collect diffusion MRI data with very high resolution and signal-to-
noise ratio on post mortem macaque brains that have previously received tracer injections for P1; and to use
these data to determine which of the pathways identified by diffusion tractography are accurate and which are
artifacts due to the inherent limitations of diffusion MRI. The second aim of core B is to use the insights
generated from the aforementioned macaque studies to guide the analysis of diffusion MRI data from human
subjects in P3-5. Core B will provide these projects with optimized data processing pipelines for mapping the
pathways likely to be involved in OCD, with the ultimate goal of investigating how these pathways differ
between patients and healthy controls (P3), and how they are affected by noninvasive or invasive interventions
(P4-5). Core B will advise the projects on all aspects of diffusion MRI data acquisition, quality assurance, and
analyses to reconstruct and characterize bundles of the OCD network."
10778644,"Abstract: Functional neuroimaging experiments utilizing both resting state fMRI and task-based fMRI are 
proposed by individual projects across the Center, to accurately characterize the OCDnet. Given the 
substantial inter-individual variability of the OCDnet, these projects require advanced analytical approaches 
that can reliably and accurately map the OCD nodes in each participant. The central goal of the present core is 
to support these projects in acquiring and analyzing functional neuroimaging data using the cutting-edge 
techniques to achieve subject-level precision. Aim 1: The core will develop and implement individualized 
targeting strategies to identify homologous, subject-specific regions and networks based on resting-state fMRI. 
We will use a “maximizing between-subject homology” strategy and parcellate each subject's cerebral cortex 
into very fine-grained functional clusters, each of which may consist of a single region or of several discrete 
regions. We will also identify homologous hub regions in humans based on connectivity patterns observed in 
non-human primates (NHPs). Aim 2: The core will develop and implement highly innovative denoising 
technologies that will dramatically improve the SNR of both task-based fMRI and resting state fMRI data. The 
denoising technology will be key to obtaining reliable task-induced functional responses not only at the 
individual subject level but also at the single trial level. Aim 3: The core will assist projects in continuing to 
implement the advanced functional MRI neuroimaging protocols developed during the previous funding 
period, that maximize within-individual signal properties and minimize anatomical distortion."

Dr. Joseph Kindler, PhD, is a nutritional bone biologist from the University of Georgia. His long-term career goal
is to lead an independent research program aimed at developing dietary interventions to minimize the burden of
bone disease in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This K01 is critical for Dr. Kindler to achieve his long-term career
goal. First, he will receive hands-on training in randomized controlled trials. He will work closely with his Primary
Mentor from Emory University, who is leading a NIDDK trial testing the effects of a low-added sugar CF diet on
glucose control in adults with CF. He will also complete coursework in clinical trial design and statistical methods.
Second, he will receive focused training in CF diet standards-of-care and nutrition-related complications,
primarily by participating in the Emory CF Scholar’s Program, which includes journal clubs, grand rounds, lab
meetings, and clinical observation. Third, he will expand his knowledge-base and technical skillset in bone
biomarkers, including bone turnover markers and novel imaging-based biomarkers from high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Dr. Kindler will complete guided readings, attend
international scientific meetings and workshops focused on biomarkers of bone metabolism and HR-pQCT
methods, complete hands-on training in HR-pQCT, and interact closely with Mentors that have expertise in bone
metabolism and imaging. Finally, he will become proficient in R01 grant writing through courses and interactions
with Mentors. These training goals dovetail with the research aims, which will test the overall hypothesis that
consuming an anti-diabetes, low-added sugar diet will improve bone health in people with CF. First, he will
assess the associations between added sugar intake and bone health outcomes, and second, he will compare
effects of a low-added sugar CF diet vs. a standard high-added sugar CF diet on bone turnover in adults with
CF. As a possible mechanism of action, involvement of gut “incretin” hormones will also be studied. This research
plan is guided by Dr. Kindler’s preliminary data on effects of diet and sub-clinical glucose dysregulation on bone
health, and involvement of entero-endocrinopathies in CF-related bone deficits. We hypothesize that first,
increased added sugar intake will associate with poorer bone health outcomes cross-sectionally and second,
that the low-added sugar diet group will have improved bone turnover compared to the high-added sugar diet
group due to the bone-augmenting effects of incretin hormones. These aims will be accomplished by leveraging
data from prior and ongoing studies conducted through Emory’s CF Center of Excellence, which is supported by
an NIDDK P30 Center Core Grant and an NIDDK R01 randomized controlled food provision trial aimed at
preventing diabetes in people with CF. Achieving the proposed training and research goals will propel Dr. Kindler
toward securing R01 funding to study long-term effects of diet modification targeting the gut-bone axis on
minimizing the burden of bone disease in CF. In turn, Dr. Kindler will be poised to achieve his long-term goal of
leading a successful NIH-funded independent research program on nutritional bone biology in CF."

Novel deep learning frameworks for predicting nucleosome-binding proteins
Nucleosome-binding proteins (NBPs) such as pioneer transcription factors play an important role in cell fate
changes during organogenesis, cell differentiation, and reprogramming. The ability of nucleosome binding is
encoded within their DNA-binding domains. However, experimental identification of the NBPs is expensive and
time-consuming with low sensitivity. The proposed research aims to develop novel deep learning frameworks to
predict the NBPs. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel two-stage transfer learning framework. In the first stage, the
knowledge of the protein language model ProtT5 will be extracted as feature embeddings to represent the amino
acid sequences of the proteins. The information from the 1-D sequences will be combined with that from their 3-
D structures, which will be processed by a state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) for 3-D molecules. In
the second stage, the GNN model will be first initialized by annotated DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) and then
fine-tuned on a NBP dataset. In Aim 2, we will design and implement a novel transfer learning-continual learning
framework to predict the NBPs in a species-specific manner. The transfer learning module initializes a novel
Bayesian online inference model with the knowledge acquired from the DBP prediction model of Aim 1 through
a prior for generative probabilistic neural networks. The continual learning module based on probabilistic
inferences will be able to constantly update learned neural network parameters with the DBPs of a given species
without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Lastly, the trained DBP prediction model will be fine-tuned
to make predictions of species-specific NBPs. Overall, this proof-of-concept study aims to gain technical
knowledge on the proposed frameworks and evaluate their feasibility for predicting the nucleosome binders.
These frameworks, if successful, will have a potential to broadly advance biomedical research by being
generalized to other types of intermolecular interactions, e.g., protein-RNA interactions and protein-protein
interactions."
10784586,"Project Summary
Accumulating evidence highlights the significance of comprehending metabolic changes in the retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) - the first site where pathogenesis occurs in many retinal degenerative diseases. The
objective of the proposed research is to gain a deeper understanding of RPE metabolism and mitochondrial
biology in both healthy and diseased states, from a cell biological perspective using state-of-the-art live
imaging methods. The results of this project will bring about novel discoveries in disease mechanisms.
 The RPE is positioned between the photoreceptors and the choroid and has a crucial role in
maintaining homeostasis in the outer retina. One of the critical functions of the RPE is the daily phagocytosis of
the photoreceptor outer segment (POS). Phagosome transport is powered by ATP-dependent molecular motor
activities, while the degradation products of the phagosome serve as a source of energy. The RPE
mitochondria must adapt to these daily metabolic events.
 The proposed study will investigate the molecular and functional basis of these changes through
metabolic analysis. Additionally, super-resolution high-speed live imaging and electron microscopy will be used
to analyze the behaviors of potentially different subsets of RPE mitochondria in relation to specific RPE
functions. The focus will be on three main questions: 1) How does RPE phagocytosis affect peroxisome-
mitochondria-dependent lipid metabolism? 2) What is the role of mitochondrial dynamics and interaction with
actin in the basal RPE? 3) What are the differences and similarities in the alterations of these mitochondrial
interactions in Choroideremia?
 The findings of the study will be compared and contrasted with observations in human RPE cell lines
and patient-derived iPSC-RPE cultures. A perfused microphysiological organ-on-chip model will also be
utilized to imitate the outer blood-retina environment. This study will provide new insights into RPE
mitochondrial dynamics, opening up the possibility of discovering new disease mechanisms and identifying
novel therapeutic targets. The proposed research and training plan aligns with the missions of the National Eye
Institute (NEI) to prevent and treat eye diseases. The applicant's advisory committee, made up of well-rounded
experts, will provide guidance, and the applicant will have access to a wide range of scientific, career
development, and diversity training resources at UCLA. This experience will help jumpstart the applicant's
independent research career and bring her closer to her long-term goal of becoming a molecular and cellular
vision biologist at a primary research university. With her earlier background in vascular biology, the proposed
training will position the applicant as a uniquely qualified expert in the study of molecular mechanisms and cell-
cell interactions in the vision system, while also promoting diversity in academia."

Candidate: Dr. Baxter received his PhD in kinesiology and post-doctoral training in orthopaedic biomechanics.
His long-term goal is to become an independent researcher focused on improving patient outcomes following
tendon injuries through an interdisciplinary research framework (1) using small animal models to identify
mechanisms that govern muscle-tendon healing and function in order to (2) optimize treatments that are tested
in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is for him to acquire the training necessary in
small animal models, ultrasound imaging, muscle physiology, and laboratory techniques to define the
biomechanical mechanisms that govern muscle-tendon remodeling that are advantageous to locomotor function.
Mentoring Committee and Training Plan: Dr. Soslowsky, will serve as primary mentor and provide structured
mentoring in of small animal models, laboratory techniques, and provide career development training. Drs.
Sehgal, Khurana, Farber, and Thelen will serve as co-mentors and provide hands-on training in ultrasound
imaging, muscle physiology, surgical techniques and clinical translation, and non-invasive load measurement,
respectively. Dr. Baxter will also participate regularly in seminars, workshops, and coursework focused on
biostatistics, bioengineering, medical imaging, muscle physiology, grant writing, and career development;
present at two national conferences each year; and continuing education on responsible conduct of research.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania is home to the McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory and Penn
Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD), a 17,500 ft2 research space that is well-equipped for the proposed
training and research plan. The PCMD and hosts several NIH supported core services focused on
musculoskeletal research, which include histology, biomechanics, and imaging. Both the PCMD and Penn host
weekly/monthly seminars in medical imaging, muscle physiology, bioengineering, and professional development.
Research: This proposed work will challenge the current paradigm that Achilles tendon ruptures are isolated
tendon injuries. The central hypothesis is that muscle-tendon tension initiates a forward-feedback loop of muscle
remodeling and tendon elongation during healing. To test this novel hypothesis, 3 aims will be completed. Aim
1 will establish the effects of Achilles tendon rupture and surgical repair on muscle composition and tendon
biomechanics throughout tendon healing. Aim 2 will define the role of tendon tension on muscle remodeling
using a clinically-relevant foot loading device and progressive stretching. Aim 3 will modify tendon elongation
following Achilles tendon rupture by stimulating muscle remodeling using non-damaging muscle-tendon
stretching protocols. Testing these aims will generate critical preliminary data for a follow-up R01 that optimizes
clinically-relevant loading paradigms that mitigate detrimental muscle remodeling and preserves function.
Institutional Commitment to Candidate: Dr. Baxter has been provided start-up funds, laboratory space, and
research personnel and has been approved to be promoted to the research faculty track by his department."
10788383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC) affect ~60,000 individuals in the US every year. Despite
aggressive treatment, the 5-year survival rate for HNSCC remains ~50% and frequently patients suffer relapse
and the development of metastatic lesions. Our previous work showed that NSD1, a histone methyltransferase
that specifically catalyzes di-methylation of histone H3 Lys36 (H3K36me2), is frequently inactivated in HNSCC.
Deletions, mutations and biochemical inhibition of NSD1 by the oncohistone H3K36M mutation are found in 15%
of HNSCC and define a novel disease subgroup with distinct molecular and clinical features. However, the
mechanism by which NSD1 inactivation promotes HNSCC development remains unclear. We recently reported
that NSD1 inactivation in HNSCC cell lines and patient samples resulted in profound DNA hypomethylation. Our
preliminary studies further demonstrated that NSD1 mutations in HNSCC are associated with increased genomic
instability and retrotransposon de-repression. Intriguingly, these molecular events are known to promote tumor
recognition by host immune system, yet NSD1 mutant tumors are unexpectedly immune “cold” with minimal
presence of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and a reduced interferon response. Therefore, we propose to test the
hypothesis that NSD1 inactivation in HNSCC reduces tumor immunogenicity and facilitates immune evasion
through epigenetic silencing of the interferon signaling pathway. In Aim 1, we will define the role of NSD1 in
HNSCC immune evasion in vivo. We plan to employ syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of
HNSCC driven by NSD1 loss that have been developed in our lab. Together with the state-of-the-art single-cell
RNA-seq and multiplex imaging technologies, we will examine the changes in tumor microenvironment following
NSD1 loss. In Aim 2, we will study epigenetic mechanisms by which NSD1 regulates interferon response. We
propose to test the model that NSD1 antagonizes H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3), a repressive histone mark
catalyzed by EZH2, to maintain STAT1 expression. In Aim 3, using syngeneic and humanized mouse models,
we will test if pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 can restore immune infiltration and delay the growth of NSD1-
deficient tumors alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor. Since only a minority of HNSCC
patients respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, our expected results will have immediate translational
implication by nominating (1) NSD1/H3K36me2 as biomarkers for predicting therapeutic response to
immunotherapy and (2) an FDA-approved EZH2 inhibitor which can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors to
target poorly infiltrated, immune “cold” tumors. More broadly, this project will also contribute to our understanding
of chromatin-based mechanisms exploited by cancer cells to facilitate immune evasion."
10788330,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~17 million Americans, contributing to more than 2.5 million deaths each year
in the United States alone and costing the United States $249 billion annually. Humans with AUD often
experience negative affect during withdrawal (WD), and depressed mood and anxiety are positively correlated
with relapse during abstinence. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying an individual’s response to alcohol,
and his/her propensity to develop AUD, are not entirely understood. Acute and chronic alcohol alter
neurotransmission in mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and chronic alcohol
also alters neurotransmission in the central amygdala (CeA), an area involved in increased anxiety during WD.
There is a functional connection between the VTA and CeA, and although each of these regions is important for
addictive behavior, the role of the connection between them in addictive behaviors is unknown. Our preliminary
data indicate that alcohol WD activates the VTA-CeA circuit in alcohol-dependent animals. The goal of this K01
proposal is to determine the mechanism underlying this circuit activation, as well as the contribution of the circuit
to increased anxiety-like behavior during WD. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that CeA-projecting
VTA dopamine (DA) neurons become activated during alcohol WD via an orexin 1 receptor (OX1R)-mediated
mechanism, and that activation of this circuit is critical in the development of dependence-associated increased
anxiety-like behavior during acute WD. To test this hypothesis, the proposal will utilize a combination of
anatomical, cellular, imaging, circuit-based and behavioral techniques. This proposal will provide a promising
young scientist with vital research training and professional development opportunities facilitated by experiments
that use an integrative approach to test the predictions that: (1) increased VTA-CeADA activity observed in vitro
during WD from chronic alcohol is mediated by OX1R/endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, (2) that increased CeA
activity observed in vivo during WD from chronic alcohol is mediated by increased DA input from the VTA, and
(3) that VTA OX1R/eCB signaling mediates alcohol WD-induced anxiety-like behavior. The results of these
studies will open new avenues of neuroscientific investigation exploring the crosstalk between brain reward and
brain stress systems in addiction. This work may also inform development of treatment strategies for reducing
negative affective symptoms in individuals with AUD, leading to improvements in quality of life and health of
affected individuals, and decreasing morbidity associated with these disorders."
10788331,"A critical barrier to overcoming triazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is the significant lack of
understanding of its genetic and molecular basis. We have shown that the known mechanisms of resistance do
not fully explain resistance observed among most clinical isolates. Our long-term goal is to improve antifungal
therapy and ensure the sustained clinical utility of the triazole class for treatment of infections caused by
Aspergillus species. Our central hypothesis is that non-cyp51A-mutation mediated mechanisms are essential
to triazole resistance in clinical isolates of A. fumigatus and involve complex genetic changes altering 1) sterol
biosynthesis and its transcriptional activation, 2) triazole transport and its transcriptional activation, and 3) as yet
unknown mechanisms. Our current objective is to address critical knowledge gaps by identifying the genetic
and molecular determinants of non-cyp51A-mutation mediated resistance. Our preliminary data suggest that
while mutations in cyp51A among triazole resistant clinical isolates are common, their overall contribution to
resistance is minimal. We have observed mutations, unique to resistant isolates in our collection, in genes
encoding sterol sensing proteins, regulators of sterol biosynthesis, and sterol biosynthesis enzymes. We have
also observed clinical isolates that overexpress not only cyp51A, but most genes of the ergosterol biosynthesis
pathway, suggesting its constitutive activation. We have observed several potential transporters that are up-
regulated among triazole resistant isolates in our collection, suggesting a role for triazole efflux and resistance
by these transporters. We have also shown that clinical isolates of A. fumigatus take up triazole antifungals via
facilitated diffusion and we believe that altered triazole import may represent an important mechanism of
resistance. To accomplish our objective we will undertake experiments that will lead to an understanding of what
genetic and molecular determinants influence triazole susceptibility through altered sterol biosynthesis or its
transcriptional activation (Aim 1) and triazole transport and its regulation (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will also utilize an
unbiased whole genome comparisons, coupled with in vitro evolution experiments, to identify completely novel
mechanisms of resistance in clinical isolates. Our approach is innovative as we will use the latest genetic and
genomic techniques to study and discover novel non-cyp51A-mutation mediated mechanisms of triazole
resistance that are operative in a U.S.-based collection of triazole resistant clinical isolates. The proposed
research is significant as it represents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular and genetic basis of non-
cyp51A-mutation mediated triazole resistance in A. fumigatus and will provide novel insights into ways in which
triazole activity can be improved against this important human pathogen."

10788440,"ABSTRACT
Blocking antibodies to CTLA4, PD-1, and other inhibitory surface receptors expressed on exhausted T cells, or
blocking antibodies to the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed by tumor and stromal cells, have been
remarkably successful at promoting long-term tumor regression. Combinations of blocking antibodies to
multiple inhibitory receptors, often reinforced with activating antibodies to costimulatory receptors, have been
more effective than treatment with individual blocking antibodies alone. Nevertheless, despite these
successes, many patients still fail to respond to `immune checkpoint blockade' therapies, emphasizing the
need to understand immune cell `exhaustion' at a molecular level, both in mouse models and in humans.
The calcium- and calcineurin-regulated transcription factor NFAT is a driver of the transcriptional responses
underlying T cell activation. The T cell activation program mainly depends on cooperative binding of NFAT and
its transcriptional partner AP1 (Fos-Jun) at composite DNA sites in gene promoters and enhancers. In parallel,
NFAT can activate a second transcriptional program that imposes a hyporesponsive state, typically termed
`exhaustion' or `dysfunction'. This second NFAT-mediated program becomes prominent in CD8+ T cells
exposed to persistent antigen stimulation during chronic viral infections and cancer, and is characterized by a
spectrum of functionally compromised states with decreased cytokine expression and increased expression of
multiple inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, TIGIT). Thus an effective alternative to combination
checkpoint blockade therapies might be to modulate the balance between the NFAT-mediated programs of
activation and exhaustion, and thereby to skew tumor-infiltrating T cells away from exhaustion and towards
effector function. We will test this hypothesis here.
Our experiments with an engineered NFAT1, minimally modified to prevent its interaction with AP1, have
established that the transcriptional program of exhaustion is independent of the NFAT1-AP1 interaction. We
have identified important targets of NFAT in the exhaustion program, including transcription factors of the Nr4a
and Tox families. Moreover, we have shown that Nr4a transcription factors act in exhausted tumor-infiltrating T
cells, in part, by repressing the expression or activation of bZIP transcription factors that would otherwise
promote an effector-like phenotype. In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize the bZIP transcription factors
that are most effective in maintaining the effector function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells under conditions
that would ordinarily lead to exhaustion; in Aim 2, we will define the differential roles of two NFAT family
members, NFAT1 and NFAT2, in the transcriptional program of exhaustion; and in Aim 3, we will use novel
proteomic strategies to identify NFAT-interacting proteins that cooperate with NFAT to impose the exhaustion
program.
Our proposed studies will test the hypothesis that CD8+ TILs are functionally silenced by a cell-intrinsic
transcriptional program mediated by persistent NFAT signalling coupled with repression of bZIP transcription
factors. The results will contribute to a broad mechanistic understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms
operating in mouse and human tumor-infiltrating T cells.

and is associated with a 4 fold risk of mortality. Platelet dysfunction is one of the main etiologies of TIC, and is a
poorly understood phenomenon. TIC-related platelet dysfunction is challenging to study as current clinical
assays are not physiologically relevant to hemostatic function. Furthermore, the optimal therapeutic approach to
address TIC-related platelet dysfunction is unknown. The aims of Dr. Shea’s research in this proposal include
the following:
 1. Characterize trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC)-related platelet dysfunction in the context of
 global hemostasis and its association with mortality.
 2. Define the relative contributions of cellular and soluble mediators to TIC-related platelet
dysfunction.
 3. Determine which transfusion strategies are effective at reversing platelet dysfunction in TIC.
The knowledge gained from the successful effectuation of these aims will result in novel insight into mechanisms
of trauma-induced platelet dysfunction and therapeutic efficacy. This will be the first time resuscitation of TIC will
be investigated in a microfluidic model of bleeding. Such a platform has the potential to be used for licensing of
hemostatic blood products, adjuncts, and agents, as well as to provide the biologic rationale for the development
of clinical trials that can assess the clinical efficacy of hemostatic products. This proposal is directly relevant to
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) mission, as the long-term objective is to use a biofidelic model
of hemostasis to define the mechanisms of and develop therapies for TIC-related platelet dysfunction."
10933466,"PIN1 is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that controls proline-mediated phosphorylation signaling events that is
overexpressed both in pancreatic cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. PIN1 overexpression is a major
contributor to tumorigenesis, activating several oncoproteins, including proteins in the KRAS pathway, and
simultaneously inactivating several tumor suppressors. Recent studies using genetic and pharmacological
inhibitors show that PIN1 regulates key oncogenic pathways. Importantly, PIN1 promotes an
immunosuppressive/treatment-resistant TME, by up-regulating PD-L1 (programmed cell-death receptor-1) The
chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, is frequently used in front-line treatment of pancreatic cancer. PIN1 also drives
chemotherapy-resistance by degrading the gemcitabine uptake-transporter, ENT1 (equillabrative nuclear
transporter-1) both in tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Hence, the development of PIN1 inhibitors
could increase sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The laboratory of Dr.
Pellecchia (University of California Riverside; UCR) has developed initial PIN1 inhibitors that have promising
pharmacokinetic properties. To do this, Dr. Pellecchia used a drug discovery strategy based on a combination
of biophysical methods including 1) medicinal chemistry 2) NMR spectroscopy, 3) X-ray crystallography (Dr.
Blaha, UCR) and 4) denaturation thermal shift measurements. This structure-based design approach used to
derive innovative covalent PIN1 targeting agents that cause degradation of PIN1 in pancreatic cell lines. Guided
by our resources and preliminary data, we propose a collaboration between UCR and CoH to 1) optimize and 2)
develop a potent and selective PIN1 inhibitor for treatment of pancreatic cancer. Aim 1 will design, synthetize,
and iteratively optimize novel, drug-like PIN1 targeting agents. Aim 2 will study the mechanism of action and
efficacy of most promising agents in cellular and animal models of pancreatic cancer. We will assess the
pharmacokinetics properties (Dr. Horne and CoHCCC shared resources) of refined agents in mice and test their
efficacy in animal models of pancreatic cancer (Dr. Horne, Dr. Raoof, CoH) including orthotopic, patient derived
xenografts, and transgenic mouse models of pancreatic cancer."

 Recent years have seen a re-emergence of pertussis as a major public health concern, despite
successful mass vaccination programs. Critical pertussis disease causes over 150,000 deaths annually.
Antibiotics are only effective if given before the onset of the characteristic cough. For these reasons, there is an
urgent need for the development of new treatments.
 The long-term goal of our group is to develop anti-pertussis therapeutics. Our central hypothesis is that
targeting tissue damage and inflammation induced by bacterial virulence factors will have a greater benefit than
traditional bactericidal therapies. We have demonstrated the potential of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
(S1PR) agonists in reducing pulmonary inflammation in mice and baboons. The objective of this work is to
understand the beneficial elements of the S1PR agonist-mediated response to guide the next generation of anti-
microbials. We identified two peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRP), -1, and -4 an antimicrobial protein,
as differentially regulated by S1PR agonism. PGLYRPs elicit bactericidal activity through interactions with
peptidoglycan (PGN). PGYLRP1 but not PGLYRP4 can stimulate inflammatory responses following PGN
binding. We hypothesize that PGLYRP4 competes with PGLYRP1 to mediate inflammatory responses. Further,
we propose that this is mediated by inhibition of host triggering receptor on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1).
 TREM-1 is an amplifier of inflammatory responses. It is upregulated following pattern recognition receptor
activation and its activity amplifies inflammatory cytokine expression. TREM-1 ligands include PGLYRP1-PGN
complexes. TREM-1 expression is reduced by S1PR agonism and inhibitor treated mice show reduced
inflammatory pathology following B. pertussis infection. We hypothesize that TREM-1 acts as a checkpoint
between beneficial bacterial control and detrimental inflammatory pathology."

10759379,"Skin, muscle, joints, and internal organs encapsulate specialized sensory neurons that detect mechanical cues in the form of touch and movement. The ability to perform most, if not all of the essential activities of daily living depends on information from these somatosensory, proprioceptive, and visceral sensory neurons. Thus, a better understanding of their function and sensitivity to mechanical and chemical stress is of vital importance for health. This research program focuses on the skin-neuron composite tissues responsible for touch and seeks to decipher how mechanical force is translated from the skin surface to embedded sensory neurons and converted into electrical signals that give rise to tactile perceptions. The work combines genetic dissection in a simple invertebrate (C. elegans nematodes) with electron microscopy, high-performance tools (self-sensing cantilevers) for delivering mechanical stimuli under feedback control and for optically monitoring tissue deformation and neuronal activation with electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The research team includes biologists, engineers and physicists and integrates experimental work with theory and simulation. In addition to seeking a comprehensive understanding of mechanosensation by skin-neuron composites, the research program will also address the outstanding question of how neurons bend without breaking. Based on preliminary work, we also plan to leverage our knowledge of touch sensation and its molecular basis to investigate how chemical stressors linked to diabetes (glucose) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel) affect the function and morphology of skin-neuron composites. The knowledge we seek to acquire is relevant to all animals, including humans that rely on skin-neuron composites for touch sensation."
10760223,"Heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated glycan expressed at the cell surface and in extracellular matrix, has long
attracted attention as a putative factor involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), based on circumstantial
evidence from in vitro and clinicopathological studies. Nevertheless, the functional significance of HS in
AD, especially in the late-onset type (LOAD) that comprises more than 90% of AD cases, is elusive. Recent
human genomic studies implicate ApoE and microglia as dominant contributors to neurodegeneration in
LOAD. The APOE gene is the strongest known genetic risk factor for LOAD. Accumulating data indicate
that ApoE proteins exert immunomodulatory effects on microglia, and that this function of ApoE is at least
partly mediated by the TREM2 receptor, another AD risk factor that is expressed by microglia. Among the
three human APOE alleles, the APOE4 allele confers an increased risk for LOAD, while the APOE2 allele
confers a decreased risk relative to the more common APOE3 allele. The molecular basis of these allele-
specific risk variations is one of the key unanswered issues in AD research. In this context, it is interesting
to note that ApoE proteins bind HS in an isoform-specific manner — ApoE4 exhibits 2- to 3-fold greater
affinity for HS than ApoE2 and ApoE3, thus apparently correlating with their relative AD risks. Furthermore,
a recent report regarding the unique case of a Columbian woman, who carries a highly detrimental
PSEN1E280A mutation, suggests that her APOE3 ""Christchurch"" mutation, which abolishes the affinity of
ApoE3 for HS, confers strong protection against neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Also
suggesting the functional involvement of HS in LOAD are recurrent reports of genetic association of HS
sulfotransferase genes with LOAD. In a series of preliminary studies, we have obtained multiple pieces of
evidence suggesting that the strong interaction of HS with ApoE4, relative to its interactions with ApoE2
and ApoE3, is the key underlying mechanism by which ApoE4 exerts a detrimental effect on the brain.
Significantly, we have found that haploinsufficient reduction in HS expression leads to the mitigation of
synapse loss and microglial activation in the PS19 TauP310S mouse model. We hypothesize that HS plays
a critical role in mediating the ApoE4 effect on microglial response and function, and that the detrimental
effect of the APOE4 allele is mainly due to its stronger interaction with the 3-O sulfate-rich HS species
expressed in microglia. We will: (1) determine the role of HS in ApoE-TREM2 interaction and signaling in
microglia; (2) determine the role of microglial HS in ApoE/ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux; and (3)
examine in vivo effects of microglial HS on brain pathology and function in AD mouse models. This
research will provide entirely novel insights into the role of HS in microglia, and moreover, into long-term
questions regarding the isoform-specific risk of APOE variants. Successful completion of this project will
reveal the ApoE4-HS interaction as a promising therapeutic target for reducing AD risk in APOE4 carriers."
10760224,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Corneal pain is an important mechanism to detect injury or damage, leading to protective responses to
limit injury if possible (tearing to remove a foreign object), initiate healing and protect the ocular surface
required for clear vision. When maladaptive, corneal pain can be so debilitating as to limit daily function,
dramatically reduce quality of life, and cause significant economic burden. There is considerable understanding
of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of pain perception in response to mechanical, chemical and
thermal stimuli, but the ability of light to influence pain (photoallodynia) after corneal injury is not well
understood. Accumulating evidence suggests photoallodynia uses melanopsin-expressing trigeminal ganglia
sensory neurons in addition to the classic retinal pathways, and that these same trigeminal ganglia neurons
contribute to corneal mechanical sensitivity. In this proposal, the knowledge gap concerning how this class of
trigeminal neurons contribute to corneal pain in normal and sensitized pathophysiological states in disease
models of corneal surface injury/dry eye disease, allergic eye disease and migraine will be addressed.
Preliminary data shows that melanopsin is expressed in both C-fiber (thermal and chemical) and Ad (pressure)
sensing mouse and human trigeminal neurons, some of which co-express CGRP. These melanopsin-
expressing neurons contribute to corneal mechanical and light sensitivity in normal and pathophysiological
conditions, and can respond to light ex vivo. Finally, the optic nerve is not required for behavioral measures of
light sensitivity in a model of trigeminal sensitization. Thus the hypothesis that melanopsin-containing corneal
trigeminal neurons function to modulate corneal mechanical sensitivity and light sensitivity by directly
contributing to corneal innervation, and use neuropeptides to modulate the corneal milieu to effect pain
perception and sensitization will be tested. Aim 1 will evaluate corneal innervation in adult and developmental
stages in mice lacking melanopsin-expressing trigeminal neurons to identify the mechanism by which these
mice have decreased corneal mechanical sensitivity. Aim 2 will evaluate the ability of melanopsin-expressing
corneal nerves to alter mechanical and light sensitivity by altering secretion of a representative neuropeptide in
normal and sensitized corneas in response to light. Aim 3 will evaluate which trigeminal ganglia neurons (C-
fiber of Ad) contribute to mechanical and light sensitivity in models of corneal disease, injury or sensitization.
The expected outcomes will elucidate molecular, cellular, anatomical and neurobiological mechanisms of
corneal innervation, pain and photoallodynia in normal and pathophysiological states."

The balance and function of effector T cells, regulatory T cells, and anergic T cells are critical for maintaining
immune homeostasis. Lack of regulatory T cells (Tregs) leads to autoimmunity mediated by self-antigen
specific effector T cells whose targets can include tissues of the eye. Although most Tregs originate in the
thymus, our previous studies suggest that in response to retinal self-antigens, Tregs can be generated locally
in the retina from conventional CD4+ T cells, a process we refer to as ""on-demand"" Treg generation. T cell
recognition of antigen-MHC-II complexes in the absence of costimulatory signals or in the presence of
inhibitory signals can induce anergy, a state of functional unresponsiveness and non-proliferation in T cells.
Thus, generation of anergic T cells may be another important mechanism for maintaining retinal immune
homeostasis. We have observed a small number of T cells and a population of myeloid cells (microglia), a
subset of which can act as conventional dendritic cells within the retina. Thus, we hypothesize there is a local,
continual generation of retinal self-antigen specific Tregs and anergic T cells within the retina that contributes
to retinal immune homeostasis and that the interaction between T cells, retinal microglia, and possibly non-
myeloid retinal cells determines the nature and fate of retinal T cells. This hypothesis will be explored in three
aims using the R161H mouse model of spontaneous retinal autoimmunity in conjunction with transgenic mice
that allow for the tracking and depletion of dendritic cells, microglia, and Tregs.
Aim 1: This aim will define the role that retinal microglia, particularly the dendritic cell subset, plays in antigen
presentation that leads to autoimmune pathogenesis in the retina.
Aim 2: This aim will define and distinguish the roles that resident retinal microglia versus the non-myeloid
retinal cells play in production of anergic and regulatory T cells within the retina.
Aim 3: This aim will be translational studies using local therapeutic manipulation of retinal microglia or other
antigen presenting cells to limit T cell co-stimulation and promote generation of anergic and regulatory T cells
to limit inflammatory injury to the retina."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is a major global health problem. Despite widespread immunization
with Bacillus Calmette–Guérin and availability of antibiotic therapy, there are 10 million new cases and 1.4 million
deaths annually, underscoring the need for improved treatment strategies. CD4 T cell-mediated immunity is
critical for protection against Mtb infection, and is governed by 1) appropriate trafficking of CD4 T cells to distinct
compartments within the Mtb-infected lung, including sites of infection, and 2) robust effector function at these
sites. We have uncovered a spatially-resolved immunosuppressive mechanism by which localized TGFβ signal
plays a dominant role in limiting the presence and function of T effector cells within the granuloma, with the
greatest effect directly adjacent to infected cells. We have shown that ablation of T cell TGFβR-signaling reverses
this suppression and results in reduced bacterial burdens. Here we propose to dissect the mechanistic
underpinnings of these observations and address the central hypothesis that: Inappropriate localization of CD4
T cells, in combination with pleiotropic inhibition by localized TGFβ activation within the granuloma core limits
effective immunity to Mtb pulmonary infection. To address this hypothesis, we will use a tractable yet physiologic
murine ultra-low dose model of Mtb infection and advanced analytical microscopy, then confirm concepts learned
in mice in human pulmonary granulomas as follows: 1) We will comprehensively characterize how individual
chemokine receptors contribute to CD4 T cell localization, activation, function and ultimately, infection outcome.
These findings will be corroborated in human granulomas. 2) We will also characterize how TGFβ activation by
individual cell types limits localized CD4 T cell activation, function and infection outcome. This will be validated
in granulomas from patients who die from active TB and those with asymptomatic Mtb infection who die from
other causes, an unparalleled resource in the antibiotic era. These studies will also yield information about
additional inhibitory pathways that are present within pulmonary granuloma and provide a framework for their
characterization which can be pursued in future R01 applications. Thus, this proposal will leverage the strengths
of our ULD Mtb mouse model and innovative imaging tools to understand how T cells traffic to infected sites and
characterize a dominant immunosuppressive factor within this space, which has important implications for
vaccine design and host-directed therapy. Dr. Gern’s career development plan builds on a background of using
advanced imaging to study pulmonary pathogens with coursework and hands-on training in advanced
immunology, Mtb pathogenesis, advanced microscopy, and laboratory management. A K08 award will allow Dr.
Gern to make maximal use of SCRI and UW’s extensive scientific resources to achieve scientific independence,
advancing his career goal to understand the factors dictating immune cell trafficking and function within different
tissue microenvironments during Mtb infection, with the ultimate goal of improving tuberculosis treatment."
10868528,"Summary. Sepsis results in massive loss of life and places a significant economic burden on society. There
are no effective treatments available for human sepsis other than antibiotics and life support. It is increasingly
clear that sepsis is a bi-phasic process comprised of 1) an early high-energy demanding hyperinflammation
state that can cause inflammatory shock and 2) a low energy supply immunosuppression state that promotes
immunometabolic paralysis while countering oxidative damage. These two phases are seamlessly connected
or even concurrent. This makes sepsis treatment extremely difficult, and many therapies such as anti-
inflammatory corticosteroids often worsen the outcome. Macrophages (MΦs) play essential roles throughout
the course of sepsis. In the hyperinflammation phase, MΦs sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) through receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-, LRP-, and pyrin domain-containing
protein 3 (NLRP3). MΦ NLRP3 inflammasome activation and resulting IL-1β secretion cause acute organ
damage and release of damage-associate molecular patterns (DAMPs), which act back on the inflammatory
pathways, forming a vicious cycle. Therefore, the MΦ NLRP3 inflammasome is a major contributor to the
hyperinflammation phase of bacterial sepsis. Concomitant with inflammasome activation, MΦs undergo a
broad cellular metabolic rewiring that favors glycolysis and turns mitochondria from ATP generation to reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress, metabolic paralysis, and MΦ
anergy in the immunosuppression phase. In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in GSDMD-
mediated pyroptotic cell death (pyroptosis), directly removing MΦs from the fight against secondary infections.
Recently, we identified that in MΦs, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) plays a critical role in
coordinating inflammasome activation and metabolic rewiring. In MΦs treated with LPS and ATP or Nigericin to
stimulate inflammasome activation, dichloroacetate (DCA, a pyruvate analog and pan-PDHK inhibitor) or JX06
(a synthetic small-molecule and selective PDHK1 inhibitor) effectively suppressed IL-1β secretion and cell
death, improved mitochondrial integrity, and reprogramed mitochondria from ROS production to ATP
generation. In a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, PDHK inhibition significantly reduced plasma
IL-1β levels. In this STTR Phase 1 project, we will test the hypothesis that JX06 can be developed as a novel
therapy for bacterial sepsis. We propose two specific aims: SA1. To determine the toxicity of JX06 in cultured
primary mouse and human cells in vitro and mice in vivo, and to study its pharmacokinetics in mice. SA2. To
establish the effectiveness of JX06 in various mouse strains using the CLP model of sepsis. This STTR Phase
1 project will validate the role of MΦ PDHK1 in bacterial sepsis and provide a proof of concept to develop JX06
or its analog as a new therapeutic agent for bacterial sepsis. The successful completion of these proposed
studies will serve as a milestone for the further development effort."

 Dizziness, vertigo, motion sickness, and simulator sickness are common clinical problems rooted in
abnormal perception of movement. Clinical testing of the vestibular system and understanding of vestibular
physiology has historically focused on reflex function and perception of isolated vestibular stimuli. However,
vestibular reflex function is poorly correlated with perceptual symptoms. Perception of self-motion is at the root
of understanding navigation, dizziness, motion sickness, and simulator sickness. Self-motion perception is
also multi-sensory and primarily involves the vestibular and visual systems, although auditory and
proprioception also may play a role in some situations. In many common clinical disorders, perceptual testing
is the first line of clinical investigation. For instance an evaluation of vision usually begins with having the
patient report what they are able to see and evaluation of hearing begins with testing what the patient is able to
hear. However, understanding of self-motion perception is not yet at a state where perceptual testing is
clinically meaningful. Most of the previous work on vestibular perception has focused on unimodal stimuli of
perceptual thresholds and tests of visual vertical which do not address the more complex multisensory
situations in which self-motion is usually experienced. The current proposal aims to advance understanding of
human motion perception into a clinically and physiologically relevant arena by examining this perception in an
appropriate, multisensory context. The project will measure visual-vestibular integration and define the
conditions where it occurs. Visual motion can be ambiguously interpreted as self-motion through a fixed
environment, environmental motion relative to a fixed observer, or inaccurate sensory calibration. The project
will examine all of these possibilities but determining the factors involved in determining common causation
which is essential for knowing if visual motion is a result of self-motion and can be integrated with vestibular
cues or is the result of external motion and should be segregated. The project will also look at mechanism
adaptation in two contexts – exposure to consistently offset visual and inertial stimuli and exposure to a
rotating environment. This will be examined in normal controls but also individuals with unilateral loss of
vestibular function. Developing a method of adaptation that is effective in vestibular pathology will be helpful in
developing tools that are potential methods of future vestibular rehabilitation."
10763910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metal dysbiosis is detrimental to any living system as approximately 40% of proteins use metals as a cofactor
or structural component. Therefore, when pathogenic bacteria invade a host, there is a battle for metal
micronutrients such as iron, calcium, manganese, and zinc that benefit each organism. While the human host
acquire metals through their diet, bacteria must acquire metals from within the host. However, for bacteria that
exist at the host/pathogen interface, some host utilized metals can be toxic to bacteria. For example, compared
to the concentrations of iron, calcium, and manganese needed for survival, zinc and especially copper are toxic
to bacteria even at lower concentrations. As such, bacteria have evolved import and export systems to
maintain homeostasis. Complicating metal acquisition is mismetallation, when the unintended metal binds to
the protein to diminish function (e.g., low enzymatic turnover or decrease substrate binding), specifically
because the stability of complex formation with divalent metal is as follows, Cu >Zn > Fe > Mn > Ca. To restrict
infection, the human host sequesters beneficial metals (iron, calcium, and manganese) while also bombarding
the bacteria with zinc and copper. How bacteria respond to copper + zinc stress and the different
concentrations of these metals they encounter in the host are largely unknown. While metal toxicity has been
the subject of other studies, most of these have focused on single concentrations of one metal and often in
complex media. These media are more lavish than the host environment and may mask portions of the metal
response. To address fundamental gaps in knowledge regarding how bacteria respond to metal dysbiosis, we
used a multi-omics approach (transcriptomics and metabolomics) to investigate the pathways affected during
bacterial disruption via copper and zinc at varying concentrations in a host-adjacent, minimal, and defined
media in Streptococcus pneumoniae as the bacterial system. Using these data and leveraging our technical
expertise in metallobiology and microbiology, we will determine how metal influx, efflux, and internal metal
concentrations (the “metallome”) respective to copper and zinc affect the transcriptome and metabolome.
These data will not only be used to determine which systems are affected, but also when these systems are
being turned on respective to concentration dependence. We will determine how some of these systems are
being regulated based on mismetallation of proteins such as DNA transcription factors. We will determine how
metal dysbiosis affects other metal transport. Lastly, we will determine if an affected system is poisoned by
copper and/or zinc or being used to overcome that stress based on examining the metabolite level respective
to the direction of the system’s transcriptomic profile."

Immunocompromised patients, including those requiring immunosuppressive therapy following organ
transplantation, are at high risk for severe disease from SARS‐CoV‐2. As SARS-CoV-2 rapidly transitions from
a pandemic virus to endemic status, like influenza, seasonal vaccinations against emerging variants will likely
become the primary tool for limiting morbidity and mortality. While the efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-
2 has been very promising, specific populations have been identified who are at increased risk of failing to
develop protective immunity. Immunocompromised populations respond poorly to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,
particularly solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Within SOT recipients,
the type and dose of immunosuppressive therapy have further been shown to impact vaccine efficacy. Patients
receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) immunotherapy, which functions by preventing B and T cell
proliferation/activation, as well as leukocyte recruitment, have the poorest humoral and cellular response post-
vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary evidence suggests that discontinuing MMF before vaccination
improves humoral responses in SOT recipients. This project will test the hypothesis that coordinated innate and
adaptive dysregulation pre-vaccination driven by MMF immunosuppressive therapy diminishes the quality,
quantity, and durability of cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in kidney transplant recipients. In Aim
1, we will characterize the impact of MMF on the generation, quality, and maintenance of adaptive immune
responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in SOT recipients. We will use validated assays to quantify and
functionally profile humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In Aim 2, we will define the pre-vaccine
immunological determinants of a protective host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney
transplant recipients and identify the mechanisms of MMF-diminished immunity. We will use systems biological
tools to comprehensively profile, at the single-cell level, the peripheral immune system prior to vaccination. In
Aim 3, we will determine how pre-vaccine MMF reduction impacts the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2
booster vaccination in kidney transplant recipients.
Together, these data will provide a comprehensive, mechanistic understanding of how MMF immunotherapy
dysregulates the immune system in SOT recipients and how this dysregulation impacts the induction and
durability of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This knowledge will allow the development of targeted
strategies to correct or circumvent MMF-driven immune dysregulation, thereby permitting efficacious responses
to SARS-CoV-2, and other vaccines, in SOT recipients and other at-risk populations."
10766136,"The risk of most cancers, including leukemias, increases exponentially as we age, with
over 90% of cancers occurring after the age of 50. This association has been primarily ascribed
to the gradual accumulation of oncogenic mutations throughout life. We contend that the
contribution of mutations, while necessary, is not sufficient to explain the role of aging in the
development of leukemias and other cancers. Just as species evolution has been driven by
environmental changes that select for adaptive phenotypes in populations, we propose that the
changes in our tissues occurring in old age are substantial contributors to oncogenesis. In
particular, inflammation increases in the bone marrow of the elderly, which contributes to impaired
hematopoiesis. Our central hypothesis is that aging-dependent increases in inflammation are
critical for enhancing selection for oncogenic mutations, and that dampening inflammation can
reduce the risk of the associated leukemias. We previously have used mouse models to show
that the aged and inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment reduces the fitness of B-cell
progenitors, promoting selection for particular adaptive oncogenic events, leading to increased
leukemogenesis. Here, we will explore how microenvironmental alterations in old age promote
oncogenesis in immature hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cell (HSPC) pools at the apex
of the hematopoietic hierarchy. We propose that C/EBPα and Myc activities are key hubs for
oncogenic selection in aged bone marrow microenvironments due to their critical roles in
balancing HSPC differentiation and self-renewal. Thus, we will develop interventions to reduce
microenvironmental perturbations that deregulate C/EBPα and Myc and lead to oncogenesis in
old age. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue two aims: 1) Determine whether aging and
inflammation drive oncogenic adaptation in the HSPC compartment and 2) Identify mechanisms
underlying increased oncogenesis with aging in HSPC pools.
 By determining whether and how microenvironmental changes impact HSPC fitness and
thus oncogenic adaptation in old age, these results could provide a new explanation for links
between aging and leukemia risk. In all, our proposed studies could provide answers for
fundamental questions: Why do we get more leukemias as we age? Why are particular oncogenic
mutations selected for in the bone marrow of the elderly? Can we alter aging-associated positive
selection for oncogenic events and thus reduce leukemia risk? These studies could also identify
interventions that reduce the risk of hematopoietic malignancies of old age by manipulating
inflammatory factors that promote oncogenesis in the bone marrow microenvironment."
10930827,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The two largest primary risk factors for late onset Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in humans are aging and the
APOE4 genotype. While the causal relationship between aging and AD is not well defined, shared phenotypes,
such as decreased metabolic function and increased inflammation, are strong leads. APOE genotype may be
linked to AD phenotype through the regulation of aging processes. The NIA Interventions Testing Program found
that 17α-estradiol (17αE2) treatment can increase the lifespan and health parameters of male mice. While
lifespan was not improved in females, limited studies have sought to uncover what other potential benefits
females may experience with 17αE2. Since 17αE2 has been shown to act upon systemic and neural pathways
that have also been associated with AD pathology, we propose that 17αE2 may constitute a pleiotropic
intervention strategy. Further, because APOE4 is associated with age-related phenotypes, 17αE2 may
preferentially improve outcomes in the context of APOE4 genotype. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis
that 17αE2 protects against aging phenotypes caused by the APOE4 allele that promote AD
development. To test this hypothesis, I will use two different mouse models of AD risk and early pathogenesis:
knock-in of human APOE3 or APOE4, and knock-in of human APOE3 or APOE4 with 5xFAD transgenes
(EFADs). Aim 1 determines the systemic and neural effects of 17αE2 on APOE3 and APOE4 early middle-aged
female and male mice, while Aim 2 focuses on the role of 17αE2 in the development of AD pathology, including
amyloid beta plaques and gliosis, using E3FAD and E4FAD mice. Our preliminary data indicate genotype
differences in the impact of 17αE2 across multiple outcomes. We maintained 10-month-old APOE3 or APOE4
targeted replacement male mice on normal chow in the absence or presence of 14.4 ppm 17αE2 for 20 weeks.
APOE4 mice exhibited an aged phenotype compared to APOE3, with higher frailty and impairments in multiple
metabolic measures. Treatment with 17αE2 yielded improvements in both APOE genotypes but with greater
effects in APOE4 mice on several measures including body weight, plasma leptin, and hepatic steatosis. These
data confirm and extend prior findings that APOE4 is linked to progeroid effects both peripherally and neurally,
outcomes associated with AD risk. Importantly, although 17αE2 significantly improved a range of measures
across genotypes, it shows the strongest effects in the APOE4 genotype. Completion of the proposed studies
will further emphasize the need to consider both genotype and sex when assessing longevity-promoting
compounds as AD therapeutics. The well-known importance of age in AD, along with the progeroid effect of
APOE4, highlight the potential to use geroscience and longevity-promoting drugs to intervene in AD
development."
10937072,"Project Summary/Abstract: This NRSA proposal, tailored to Mr. Solis, provides high-quality predoctoral
research training and career development centered upon his future goals. The sponsor’s excellent mentoring
record, collaborations with leading bone and kidney biomedical researchers, and the outstanding environment
at the IUSM and Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health (ICMH) will contribute to the successful completion
of this project. Additionally, participation in the Preparing Future Faculty and Professionals program for ethics
and grant writing courses, manuscript preparation, departmental seminars and journal clubs, as well as national
meetings will enhance Mr. Solis’s career development towards becoming a well-rounded, independent
investigator. Previous studies from the sponsor’s lab and others have identified gain- and loss of function
mutations in Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) that resulted in severe metabolic bone diseases, placing
FGF23 as a hormone central to phosphate metabolism. FGF23 is an important factor in common diseases of
altered phosphate handling such as chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), with high
circulating concentrations associated with patient mortality. Although progress has been made in understanding
basic and clinical aspects of phosphate handling in CKD, the regulatory mechanisms governing FGF23-
dependent phosphate homeostasis remain unclear. Importantly, chronic inflammation arises in CKD with tissue
damage and increased production of inflammatory cytokines. It is known that specific cytokines signal through
NF-κB-mediated mechanisms, however how this pathway influences FGF23 actions is unknown. Indeed, both
renal inflammation and elevated FGF23 are associated with poor outcomes in CKD, therefore identifying
regulatory mechanisms interconnecting FGF23 bioactivity and pro-inflammatory cytokines could provide targets
for therapeutic intervention. Our initial results strongly support novel interactions between these pathways and
FGF23 bioactivity. Thus, my central hypothesis is: NF-κB activity negatively regulates kidney FGF23-mediated
mineral metabolism, and TNFα driven inflammatory responses exacerbate this effect in CKD. In Aim 1, the
mechanisms dictating NF-κB regulation of FGF23 bioactivity will be tested in vitro; and Aim 2 will test TNF
cytokines on FGF23-dependent mineral metabolism in novel models of FGF23 overexpression and in CKD with
genetically ablated TNF signaling. Using these systems, Mr. Solis will gain new research skills in gene targeting
and utilizing state of the art translational mouse models. Collectively, this proposal will provide excellent
research, ethics, and written and oral presentation training to Mr. Solis, as well as test important disease
mechanisms that result in endocrine disturbances of mineral metabolism."
10904950,"Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as Zika, dengue, West Nile, and Powassan viruses cause hemorrhagic fever, congenital diseases, and fatal encephalitis in humans. Zika virus (ZIKV) has the unique ability of human-to- human transmission vertically from mother to fetus and horizontally through sexual contact. In the current proposal, we identify a previously undefined cellular mechanism of ZIKV assembly in live placental cells and aim to characterize the underlying mechanisms of formation and intracellular trafficking of modified membrane structures that facilitate maturation and release. We present preliminary data supporting our novel hypothesis that aptamer tagging of genomic RNA and using fluorescent-protein tagged capsid and nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A), we can visualize and understand mechanisms of virus assembly and virus-host interactions in live cells. By creating a library of mutant ZIKV for live imaging, we identified critical amino acids in capsid protein and NS2A coordinating virus assembly. Using tagged NS2A ZIKV, we present the first viral and host interactome of NS2A from infected cells that have thus far evaded mass spectrometry approaches and identified NS2A-interacting host proteins associated with microcephaly, RNA trafficking, and ER modifications. Using confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that ZIKV NS4B modifies the canonical secretory pathway and mediates homotypic fusion of vesicles originating from the ER exit sites forming large perinuclear structures near the Golgi apparatus. Building on our preliminary data and using unique ZIKV infectious clones and tools we have so far developed; we propose a rigorous set of experiments designed to test our hypothesis that flaviviruses modify the ER and host secretory pathways to form large vesicular structures that facilitate assembly and intracellular trafficking. First, using a library of labeled viral RNA and protein constructs with confocal imaging, we will confirm the fate of viral RNA, identify the specific regions of C, NS2A, and RNA that may participate in virus budding and interaction with viral and host proteins, and evaluate whether RNA interacting proteins facilitate assembly (Aim 1). Second, using an advanced affinity purification-mass spectrometry and siRNA and CRISPR knockdown approach, we will determine the genomic pathways in the ER that are key for virus production and cellular membrane modification (Aim 2). And third, we will investigate the ER exit of assembled viruses, NS4B mediated large vesicle formation, and vesicular retrograde transport via microtubules and determine its effect on the dynamics of ZIKV maturation (Aim 3). Our findings will establish a previously undescribed and essential cellular mechanism for the assembly of ZIKV and identify critical targets for intervention in ZIKV infections and other related viruses, addressing a significant global public health need and contributing to the NIAID mission to understand, treat, and prevent infectious diseases. This knowledge can generate new ER-associated targets for therapeutic intervention to mitigate viral transmission at the maternal-fetal interface."
10937071,"Project Summary/Abstract
Healthy vision requires the function of parallel cellular and synaptic pathways in the neural retina. Circuits
constructed from diverse cell types provide the anatomical and physiological basis for encoding diverse visual
scenes. Indeed, visual inputs to the mouse retina are converted to electrical signals by photoreceptors (1 rod, 2
cone types), integrated by interneurons (1 horizontal, ~15 bipolar, ~60 amacrine cell types), and relayed to the
brain by retinal ganglion cells (>40 types) whose axons form the optic nerve. In a surgical model of nerve
injury, called the optic nerve crush (ONC), the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are damaged. In
response to ONC, 70-80% of RGCs die within two weeks. The death of RGCs is biased, however, and
depends on the RGC type. A group of resilient RGC types persists and survives for weeks following the crush,
whereas other susceptible RGC types die within a few days. A long-term goal of the ONC model is to rescue
injured RGCs and enable regrowth of axons to target brain regions and restore functional vision. The field has
identified transcriptomic and tissue-level mechanisms that promote RGC survival. Furthermore, RGC survival
and axon regeneration are enhanced by RGC electrical activity (e.g., action potential firing). However, there is
a major gap in our understanding of (1) how activity of different RGC types is affected following ONC; (2) how
changes in activity align with the resilient/susceptible category of RGC types; and (3) whether there are cellular
or synaptic mechanisms that are affected by ONC and prohibit the ability to enhance activity in certain RGC
types following injury. I will therefore utilize electrophysiological and confocal microscopy techniques to
directly address my hypothesis that dysfunction and reduced firing in RGCs post optic nerve crush
depends on the RGC type and reflects a combination of synaptic and cell-intrinsic mechanisms. I will
measure the anatomy and physiology of specific RGC types that are either resilient or susceptible to ONC and
determine the contributions of either synaptic or intrinsic mechanisms to RGC hypoactivity after ONC.
Understanding these mechanisms will generate insights into how naturally-occurring diseases that affect the
optic nerve, such as glaucoma, cause dysfunction and death of RGCs and could contribute to the design of
rational therapies."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss
and cognitive impairment. AD leads to a significant reduction in quality of life, and with a rapidly growing
prevalence, there is a dire need for improved therapies. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor delta
(PPARd) is a ligand activated transcription factor that has emerged as a potential target for neuroprotection.
PPARd agonism has been shown to improve disease phenotypes in neurodegenerative disease model mice,
and disruption of PPARd function in the central nervous system (CNS) of normal mice has been shown to elicit
neurodegeneration. PPARd agonism is also currently in a Phase 2a clinical trial for treatment of mild-to-moderate
AD. Of all the brain cells, microglia express PPARd most highly; however, the mechanistic basis of PPARd
activity in microglia remains undefined. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and have been
repeatedly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, so understanding the role of PPARd in microglia will provide
insight into its therapeutic value.
 Preliminary data reveals that PPARd can suppress inflammation in the brains of Huntington’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease and tauopathy model mice. Additionally, preliminary RNA-sequencing data on isolated
microglia from wild-type mice treated with the PPARd agonist KD3010 shows that PPARd agonism leads to
downregulation of inflammatory genes (e.g. Il-1b and SPP1) as well as the downregulation of several AD relevant
genes in microglia (e.g. C1QA/C1QB, IL12b and TYROBP). Microglia have been shown to take on aberrant
phenotypes in disease settings. These altered phenotypes have been shown to be cell-autonomous in human
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia like cells (iMGLs) that harbor mutations relevant to AD.
For example, APOE4 microglia have been shown to exhibit reduced uptake of beta-amyloid, have shortened
processes, and have increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. iMGLs are powerful models for human
microglia, as they are transcriptionally and phenotypically similar.
 This proposal will uncover the mechanistic basis of PPARd function in microglia and interrogate whether
PPARd agonism can attenuate the aberrant phenotypes seen in microglia in the context of AD. I will first assess
whether PPARd transactivation of neuroprotective targets is dependent upon phase separation with the
transcriptional coactivator Mediator 1 and whether PU.1, which is a genetic risk factor for AD, interferes with
PPARd neuroprotection. I will then derive iMGLs from iPSCs that harbor an AD risk allele (APOE4) to assess
whether PPARd can attenuate the abnormal phenotypes, focusing on cytokine secretion and phagocytic
capacity. Understanding the role that PPARd plays in microglia and how its activation affects microglia in an AD-
relevant setting has the potential to provide further support as to why PPARd agonism should continue to be
pursued as a therapeutic for AD."

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting ~800,000 Americans
annually. Optimal healing of the damaged tissue requires the delicate balance, both spatially and temporally, of
inflammatory and reparative mechanisms to create the fibrotic scar. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the main
contributor to fibrotic remodeling. Following ischemic injury, CFs transition into an activated phenotype that is
characterized by increased proliferation, migration to the infarct region, and secretion of fibrotic proteins and
paracrine signals. At the same time, dysregulation of the CF response to injury can promote pathological fibrosis,
increased risk for arrhythmia, and cardiac dysfunction. While there has been many studies exploring the diverse
signaling cascades and stressors that cause CF activation, how these stressors regulate the CF phenotype and
paracrine signal generation, both spatially and temporally, remain elusive.
Recent work identified stress-induced loss of the cytoskeletal protein, βIV-spectrin, to be an important step in CF
activation and fibrosis3. Further, loss of βIV-spectrin was found to depend on Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII). A broader role has been identified for βIV-spectrin/CaMKII in regulating CF gene expression
through an interaction with signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3)3,4, a signaling molecule
and transcription factor that promotes profibrotic mechanisms. Specifically, CaMKII is activated and promotes
loss of βIV-spectrin and redistribution of STAT3 to the nucleus that lead to changes in gene expression. Together,
this leads to the hypothesis that the βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex acts as a signaling node that is necessary for
regulating cardiac fibroblast activation, recruitment, and scar formation post MI. To evaluate this hypothesis, Aim
1 will identify the role of the βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex in CF activation and long-range communication. CFs
will be subjected to both biomechanical stretch and neurohormonal stimuli, correlating to MI pathophysiology, to
evaluate the effects on CF activation and exosome secretion. To understand how remote CFs migrate to the
infarct area, long-range communication signals from spectrin-deficient CFs will be characterized and cultured
with fresh CFs to see if they lead to activation. Additionally, this project will offer mechanistic insight into the
spatiotemporal regulatory role of spectrin-based proteins in modulating exosome secretion following chronic
stress. Lastly, Aim 2 will subject spectrin-preserved and spectrin-deficient mice to MI and evaluate the effects
on scar formation and maturation. These studies will offer insight into how specific stress combinations tune the
process of fibrotic remodeling following MI, and how these regulatory proteins can affect the overall outcome of
MI patients."

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is a set of diverse conditions caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) that
can produce a wide variety of physical, behavioral, and intellectual deficits persisting throughout the lifespan.
Importantly, PAE is also associated with deficits in emotional regulation, including increased non-social and
social anxiety. However, the PAE-induced neurobiological changes that underlie this heightened vulnerability
to develop increased social anxiety are not well understood. This gap in knowledge is problematic because a
precise understanding of neuroadaptations resulting from PAE is necessary to develop targeted treatments for
individuals experiencing PAE-related social impairments. Activity of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its
receptor (CRF1R) in the medial subnucleus of the central amygdala (CeM), has long been known to regulate
anxiety-like behavior, and disruption of the function of the CeM CRF system could contribute to increased
social anxiety-like behavior in individuals exposed to PAE. Our lab has recently demonstrated that moderate
PAE on gestational day (G)12, around the time of neurogenesis in the rat amygdala, increased social anxiety-
like behavior in adult male rats. Additionally, G12 PAE disrupted CRF1R modulated inhibitory
neurotransmission and non-social anxiety-like behavior in male rats, suggesting that moderate G12 PAE
impairs CeM CRF1R regulated synaptic and behavioral function in adult male rats. These deficits could
subsequently alter the function of CeM downstream projection targets, such as the periaqueductal gray, which
is a brain region known to regulate defensive behaviors in response to threats, including social threats. This led
us to the development of our central hypothesis, that moderate G12 PAE increases social anxiety-like behavior
due to decreased function of the CRF1R positive (+) CeM-PAG projection in male rats. To test this, we will use
whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to assess differences in neuronal excitability and neurotransmission
in PAG-projecting CRF1R+ cells. Additionally, we will chemogenetically stimulate the CRF1R+ CeM-PAG
projection prior to testing in a modified social interaction test to generate a measure of social anxiety-like
behavior. Finally, we will further explore the possibility that the PAG underlies PAE-induced social impairments
by assessing differences in cellular activation in the PAG following social interaction testing in male and female
rats. The proposed experiments will expand our understanding of PAE-induced alterations in neural
mechanisms, how these alterations relate to social anxiety-like behavior, and provide evidence to inform future
studies designed to investigate the neuroadaptations resulting from moderate PAE. Additionally, successful
completion of the goals outlined in this proposal will provide me with training in cutting-edge techniques,
science communication, and mentoring that will prepare me for a career as an independent scientist."

Dysphagia (swallowing impairment) is a common complication of cardiac surgical procedures, leading to
malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, reintubation, increased health care utilization, length of
hospitalization, and economic burden. Although preventable, dysphagia-related aspiration pneumonia is a major
cause of mortality. Early detection and accurate monitoring of dysphagia are therefore important to facilitate
timely interventions to mitigate developing sequelae. Currently, clinical care of dysphagia is hindered by
fundamental gaps in knowledge, including 1) contributing risk factors of dysphagia are unknown, prohibiting the
use of triaged personalized care pathways; 2) no validated tools to accurately detect and monitor dysphagia in
the cardiac intensive care unit exist; and 3) governing mechanisms of swallowing impairment and recovery of
function are unknown, impeding the development of mechanistically guided therapeutics and optimization of
salient postoperative evaluation time points. Our three specific aims target these knowledge gaps with the broad
goal to shift care toward a proactive, multifaceted, and data-driven perioperative Model of Swallowing Integrated
Care (MOSAIC). To this end, we will enroll 360 cardiac surgical patients over a four-year period and identify 1)
independent risk factors for dysphagia, 2) sensitive clinical markers of swallowing impairment, and 3) governing
physiologic mechanisms of unsafe and inefficient swallowing throughout the acute, sub-acute, and long-term
postoperative period. Enrolled participants will undergo a preoperative Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of
Swallowing (FEES) to screen out patients with pre-existing dysphagia. Candidate predictor variables will be
systematically collected throughout the perioperative time course. Following surgery and within 48 hours of
extubation, a simultaneous videofluoroscopy and FEES (VF-FEES) will be performed as well as a battery of
simple bedside clinical tests. Detailed blinded analyses will be performed using validated metrics of swallowing
safety, efficiency, timing and kinematics to examine acute-phase swallowing function and associated
physiologic mechanisms of unsafe or inefficient deglutition. Patients with acute postoperative phase dysphagia
will be re-examined at one- and six-months to determine sub-acute and long-term dysphagia trajectories and
governing mechanisms of impairment and recovery. Multivariable modeling of dysphagia risk factors will
produce a practical dysphagia risk stratification tool to enable accurate forecasting and personalized triaged
postoperative care pathways. An accompanying open-access electronic application will be developed to provide
seamless clinical adoption and a data-driven clinical decision making tool. The discriminant ability of clinical
markers will be determined, and a practical bedside dysphagia screening tool will be validated to enable accurate
detection and monitoring of dysphagia in the cardiac intensive care unit. Outcomes will drive future targeted
therapeutic and preventative strategies and enhance personalized health care models to ultimately improve
patient outcomes."
10758786,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Artificial Intelligence (AI) - computer-based algorithms capable of learning from enormous data sets, including
electronic health records and chart notes, in order to carry out tasks typically reserved for humans – is poised
to dramatically affect medical research and practice, including end-of-life and palliative care (EOLPC). Recent
AI-based algorithms seem capable of accurately predicting a patient’s prognosis or probability of death years in
advance. These algorithms can do so in an automated fashion, without the input of clinicians, and they are
starting to move from research into practice. For the millions of Americans who experience the physical,
psychological, and social effects of severe and chronic illness, knowing a prognosis could promote earlier
access to palliative care and to support medical decision-making that is consistent with patients’ and families’
goals and preferences. However, AI also raises concerns about loss of autonomy in patient or clinician
decision-making, depersonalized or unempathetic care, racially biased algorithms, distrust of “black box”
machines, and an over-emphasis on survival statistics in decision-making. Studies consistently show that
patients and caregivers may be unaware of their prognosis, that physicians are often inaccurate in predictions,
and that patients of certain socioeconomic statuses or races may be less aware of their prognosis; however,
the need for an accurate prognosis may vary by disease state, individual preference, or other sociocultural
factors. Thus, how AI-based prognostication will affect our basic scientific understanding of the role of
prognostic awareness in medical decision-making in support of high quality, goal concordant EOLPC is a
critical knowledge gap. Before AI becomes more widely used in EOLPC, spreads to other uses (e.g., virtual
nurse assistants and caregiver robots), or becomes necessary as proof o f eligibility for services (e.g., hospice),
there is an urgent need to understand its potential impact on patient- and family-centered care and to develop
practical ethics guidance for its use. The goal of this project is to ensure AI is developed and implemented in
ways that support high quality EOLPC. With a unique team of experts in palliative care, artificial intelligence,
bioethics, and patient engagement, we will: (1) use semi-structured interviews to obtain rich insights into the
experiences and beliefs of all EOLPC team members, patients, and family caregivers regarding AI-based
prognostication at 4 purposefully chosen sites across the United States; (2) conduct a nationally representative
survey of palliative care physicians regarding the anticipated benefits and challenges of using AI-based
prognostication; and (3) convene a Delphi panel of experts to create practical recommendations for the use of
AI in EOLPC. The project will be supported within the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC)
(U2C NR014637), a robust interdisciplinary research community comprised of more than 500 members at
more than 180 sites."
10758790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Both high incidence (i.e., 15%) and low remission rate (i.e., 30-50%) of postpartum distress symptoms indicate
a need for more research on the underlying mechanisms associated with elevated maternal distress and
caregiving deficits. Severe symptoms of maternal distress will continue to inflict significant morbidity and elicit
poor child health outcomes unless we initiate a system-wide change in how nurses and other healthcare
professionals understand and recognize indicators of maternal distress. Prior research has determined that
mothers with elevated distress symptoms (e.g., irritability and anhedonia) display suppressed neurological
reward responsivity. However, few studies have examined the role of reward responsivity to loss and
caregiving behaviors. Even fewer studies have asked women to describe their experience with goal pursuit
during the postpartum period and perceived functional ability as a mother. To address this research gap, the
proposed study will apply the Regulatory Focus Theory to link both aberrant reward responses and disruptive
caregiving behaviors to specific distress symptom sets assessed with the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety
Symptoms (IDAS) self-report measure. Aim 1 will use a retrospective, secondary analysis to correlate fMRI
imaging data with IDAS scores to determine distinct symptom sets that are associated with suppressed reward
responsivity. Aim 2 will use prospective, mixed-methods analyses to correlate maternal caregiving behaviors
with IDAS scores and qualitative interviews from a subset of 12 mothers. Exploratory Aim 3 will interpretively
synthesize findings from Aims 1 and 2 to propose an initial risk phenotype for maternal distress. This initial step
toward developing a risk phenotype will guide future research to improve early detection of women most
vulnerable to developing debilitating symptoms of distress during the postpartum period. The proposed study
and associated research training provide a comprehensive foundation for an innovative program of nursing
research focused on the bidirectional nature of the caregiver-child relationship as it relates to Regulatory Focus
Theory, specifically whether enhancing maternal self-regulation can prevent child development disorders."
10918299,"Project Summary/Abstract
 DFUs will affect more than 30% of diabetic patients within their lifetime and costs the US
healthcare system over $20 billion annually. Many DFUs fail to heal effectively and require
extensive medical intervention. Nearly 50% of DFUs worsen to “tunnel” into deep tissues
involving tendons and bones (DTU-DFUs). When this happens, DFUs are susceptible to severe
complications like infection, which significantly increases cost of treatment and the risk of lower
limb amputation and death.
 The current treatment for DTU-DFUs is expensive, time consuming, complicated, and
involves the sequential and cyclical application of multiple products. Antimicrobial management
is always the first step in wound care, as failure to keep a wound free of infection limits healing.
Despite the many antimicrobial products available, outcomes remain unsatisfactory.
 Gel4Med has developed G4Derm, a biosynthetic flowable wound care product designed
to address complex DTU-DFUs. G4Derm has already demonstrated efficacy and safety in
preclinical studies. The final product is a flowable scaffolding matrix provided as a shelf-stable,
ready, and easy-to-use syringe with an applicator tip. The flowable form factor allows G4Derm
to completely fill cavities of complex tunneling wounds. Once applied, the hydrogel resolves into
a scaffolding matrix with mammalian cell attachment sites to facility tissue regeneration. The
patented composition of G4Derm is uniquely and inherently antimicrobial – the gel disrupts
bacterial membranes on contact. In combination, these characteristics make G4Derm a highly
useful product to address the dire unmet need of DTU-DFUs.
 The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and feasibility of
G4Derm in an early-phase, pilot clinical study for patients with refractory DTU-DFUs. This
clinical evaluation is key to making G4Derm available to patients with DTU wounds. Gel4Med
will collect data on wound healing, tissue regeneration, quality of life, and risk of infection. After
the treatment period, patients will be able to participate in a 6-month follow-up period to assess
the risk of recurrence and durability of wound closure.
 The completion of this pilot clinical study is a key step to bringing G4Derm, which
combines enhanced wound healing with microbial management, to patients with treatment-
resistant DTU-DFUs and represents a paradigm shift in the treatment complex chronic wounds."

 This renewal application for a K24 seeks to continue to provide time for the candidate, Jennifer Friedman,
MD, PhD, to provide mentorship to junior faculty in patient oriented research (POR) with a focus on optimizing
interventions for parasitic diseases among pregnant women and children. The second goal is to provide time
for Dr. Friedman to further her own career development through a) pursuit of advanced education in Structural
Equation Modeling and characterization of the human microbiome and b) leading policy changes to include
pregnant women and young children in treatment programs for schistosomiasis.
 Dr. Friedman proposes to continue to mentor junior faculty and fellows conducting POR at the Center for
International Health Research (CIHR). The Center is an outstanding model for interdisciplinary team science,
where most faculty are physician-scientists and other scientists carry out translational research as an integral
part of these teams. In the first phase of this K24, Dr. Friedman closely mentored five junior faculty at CIHR. Of
these, four were recipients of Career Development Awards with Dr. Friedman as primary or co-mentor and the
other was a target young investigator on a large training grant (Centers for Biomedical Research Excellence
(COBRE)) in infectious diseases. In addition, one mentee (Levine) received his first independent grants (R03
and R01) in 2017 with grant writing mentorship provided by Dr. Friedman.
 The overarching scientific goal of this proposal is to advance studies elucidating mechanisms through
which schistosomiasis contributes to environmental enteropathy, culminating in microbial translocation,
systemic immune activation, and adverse pregnancy and nutritional outcomes. Dr. Friedman has two current
R01s that provide outstanding opportunities for junior faculty to conduct POR in global health. The first is a
longitudinal birth cohort (PIs Friedman, Gundogan) that has already enrolled N=400 pregnant women and is
now following the newborns until age two. The second is a multi-site RCT (PIs Friedman, Bustinduy) examining
optimal dose and dosing frequency of praziquantel for children under the age of four. Both grants provide both
opportunities to conduct field work at sites with longstanding collaborations and will offer a wealth of well
characterized data and samples to address the aims proposed in this K24 as well as other aims conceived of
by mentees. They will also be able to engage in other NIH grants at CIHR with co-mentoring by Dr. Friedman
and other faculty (see letters of support).
 Brown University affiliated hospitals provide a rich source of potential mentees from a range of Divisions
housing junior faculty interested in conducting POR in infectious diseases. In addition, although there are
numerous other training grants at Brown affiliates, there are two T32 awards, two COBRE awards, and one
R25, which could specifically provide a pipeline for young investigators and co-funding in research areas of
interest to Dr. Friedman."

Identification of novel, non-cognitive (i.e., sensory or motor), non-invasive markers of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias are a national priority identified by the National Alzheimer Plan. Growing evidence suggests
that Alzheimer’s pathology manifests in sensory association areas well before appearing in neural regions
involved in memory function. Previous investigations have failed to examine the interplay and time course of
sensory, cognitive, and motor dysfunction on the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The ability to successfully
integrate multisensory information across multiple sensory modalities is a vital aspect of functioning and mobility
in the real world. Our research suggests that multisensory integration could be used as a novel marker for
preclinical Alzheimer’s disease given reported associations between magnitude of visual-somatosensory
integration and important cognitive (attention) and motor (balance, gait, and falls) outcomes. We have highlighted
the adverse effects of dementia and mild cognitive impairment on these relationships, but the underlying
functional and neuroanatomical networks remain to be uncovered. Identification of these functional networks is
critical to guide development of future multisensory-based interventions to prevent non-cognitive outcomes such
as falls in cognitively impaired individuals. Hence, we propose to recruit 208 community-dwelling older adults
with and without preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (defined as impaired cognitive function on neuropsychological
testing and presence of Aß in plasma) for a three-year longitudinal observational study. Our central hypothesis
is that preclinical Alzheimer’s disease is associated with neural disruptions in subcortical and cortical areas that
concurrently modulate multisensory, cognitive, and motor functions, resulting in mobility decline. Our strategic
experimental design, which leverages existing longitudinal cohorts, aims to assess the validity of multisensory
integration as a behavioral marker for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. It also provides an opportunity to examine
the integrative time course and interplay of individual sensory, motor, and cognitive processes (and their
interactions) in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed project addresses the NIH’s priority, as well as
NIA’s special interest notice [NOT-AG-20-053]. This work will increase understanding of the neurobiology of
Alzheimer’s disease and will guide future multisensory-based intervention studies that aim to alleviate disability
and maintain independence in older adults with and without preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.

10767511,"African Americans experience higher cancer incidence and mortality rates, are diagnosed at more advanced
stages, and have poorer overall survival than other populations. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with
cancers with genetic risk, highlighting the need for robust and accessible interventions to increase recommended
genetic testing (GT). It is also essential to recognize that a legacy of medical mistrust, rooted in historically
negative healthcare experiences and medical research abuses, among African Americans may pose culturally
specific barriers to uptake of GT. Further, social determinants such low genomic literacy and limited access to
genetic counseling (GC) services may also serve as barriers to the uptake of risk-appropriate GT among African
American. This study will build on an established community partnership with the Genomics Research Action
Council to adapt a culturally relevant educational intervention to increase uptake of GT among African
Americans. The first goal of the partnership will be to tailor messaging and educational genetic counseling (GC)
content to address low genomic literacy and medical mistrust among medically underserved African Americans.
The second goal is to increase access to online GC information among African Americans who may be
constrained by socially determined barriers such as access to care, cost, and transportation. Guided by the
Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model, this study will develop an easily accessible and
scalable online educational GC intervention to increase GT among at-risk African Americans. Our aims are:
Aim 1: Guided by the ORBIT model and in partnership with community stakeholders and clinical genetic

intervention designed to (a) increase genomic literacy and (b) reduce medical mistrust on uptake of GT
among at-risk African American survivors
Aim 3: Collaborate with community stakeholders and clinical genetic professionals to translate study
findings, develop a roadmap for dissemination to the community, and identify implementation barriers
to prepare for a future Phase IIb randomized trial
The impact of this project lies in understanding how to translate novel genetic discoveries into clinical practice
for African Americans who may face culturally relevant and socially determined barriers to GT. Developing
scalable and sustainable interventions that address these barriers has the potential to significantly reduce a key
driver of racial health disparities in overall cancer burden for African Americans."

10788362,"There is a global aim to reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection and prevent the
development of HBV-associated end-stage liver disease and cancer. The improvement of existing therapeutics
is expected to help achieve this goal. Specifically, the usage of once two-month injectable nucleos(t)ide
analogs in combination with immunomodulating antiviral compounds instead of life-long daily pills has the
strong potential to help to achieve a functional cure for CHB. To this end, we propose to transform water-soluble
antiviral drugs, first-line drugs tenofovir (TFV) and entecavir (ETV), and immunomodulating drug tizoxanide
(TIZ) into hydrophobic lipophilic crystalline prodrugs. We will formulate them as nanosuspensions suitable for
intramuscular injection. The efficient optimization of physicochemical properties of nanocrystals is expected to
improve their pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles. This optimization will enhance
uptake of the prodrug nanocrystals by liver macrophages and hepatocytes to ensure a slow release and
sustained therapeutic drug concentrations at the site of hepatitis B viral replication.
 The treatment with long-acting TFV, ETV, and TIZ is expected to decrease dosing frequency, limit toxicity,
and facilitate sustained viral suppression and treatment. A functional cure for HBV is expected to be achieved
via multifactorial mechanisms, including inhibition of viral polymerase, prevention of cccDNA formation, and the
clearance of HBV micro-chromosomes via stimulation of host innate immunity by TIZ. Thus, the overall
objective of this proposal is to develop clinically translatable, long-acting, injectable, antiviral drug
nanoformulations to increase adherence and enhance drug delivery to sites of persistent HBV infection,
thereby facilitating sustained viral suppression and finite cure. To this end, three specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1: Develop long-acting anti-HBV prodrug nanoformulations and evaluate the drug efficacy. Here, we will
apply pronucleotide (ProTide) and a modified HepDirect prodrug technology to transform existing drugs into
hydrophobic prodrugs suitable for formulation as nanosuspensions to achieve prolonged therapeutic active
drug concentrations in hepatocyte. This is expected to improve drug biodistribution to infected hepatocytes
without compromising drug potency and safety profile. The prodrug formulations will be screened in vitro in
human macrophages as a potential drug depot and in infected hepatocytes as final targets. The anti-HBV
activity of prodrug nanocrystals will be examined in vitro and in vivo using HBV-infected humanized mice. Aim
2: To develop long-acting TIZ nanoformulation and evaluate the mechanisms by which TIZ suppresses HBV
replication in infected hepatocytes. Aim 3: To evaluate the synergistic efficacy of the selected long-acting TIZ
and NUC formulations and evaluate the ability of this combination to eliminate HBV cccDNA from hepatocytes
and significantly reduce the concentration of HBsAg."
10788363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common causes of healthcare-associated
infectious diarrhea and results in significant morbidity and mortality. CDI occurs when the native gut
microbiome is disrupted, most often following antimicrobial therapy, and the consequent dysbiosis results in a
decrease in microbial diversity, changes in abundance of certain bacterial taxa, and loss of colonization
resistance against C. difficile. Restoration of a “functionally intact” gut microbiome is critical to clearing C.
difficile, and inadequate restoration can lead to recurrent CDI. The recovery of the gut microbiome from
dysbiosis is poorly understood, and factors associated with having and re-gaining a microbiome capable of
providing colonization resistance against C. difficile are not well known. While animal reservoirs can serve as
potential sources of pathogenic bacteria, studies by the candidate and other investigators found that pet
ownership protects against colonization and re-infection with C. difficile. Moreover, microbiota are shared
between pets and their owners, and the microbiomes of pets contain bacterial taxa that provide colonization
resistance against C. difficile. Based on these data, the proposed research will 1) test the hypothesis that the
observed protective effects of pet ownership are due to sharing of microbiota that provide colonization
resistance against C. difficile between pets and owners; 2) determine whether pet contact mitigates
antimicrobial-associated disruption of the gut microbiome and enhances its recovery; and 3) assess whether
pet contact decreases the likelihood of colonization and infection with C. difficile following antimicrobial
therapy. This will be accomplished though longitudinal sampling of the gut microbiome within the patient/pet
unit among patients older than 60 years (i.e., at greatest risk of CDI) receiving prophylactic antimicrobials for
non-enteric indications (dental implants).
 The study will further define epidemiologic and pathophysiologic characteristics of CDI that could
enhance therapeutic options for this disease. The underlying premise that animals are a source of protective
microbiota rather than a reservoir of C. difficile represents a paradigm shift in CDI epidemiology that may
identify animal contact as a novel microbiome-based form of therapy. The proposed study will form a
foundation for an independent career in patient-oriented research dedicated to understanding and mitigating
antimicrobial-associated dysbiosis and CDI. The candidate will acquire experience in directing a large,
observational microbiome study and essential training in the advanced statistical and bioinformatics methods
necessary to analyze the interaction between patient-level factors and microbial ecology. The research
proposal is paired with a career development plan that makes use of the extensive resources of the University
of Pennsylvania and that capitalizes on a superlative mentoring committee with broad, complementary
expertise in infectious diseases epidemiology, deep sequencing methods, bioinformatics, and microbiology."
10788458,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and many related dementias (ADRDs) are tauopathies, characterized by
somatodendritic accumulation of tau and intraneuronal inclusion bodies composed of tau species that have
undergone extensive post translational modification. Although some disease-specific Tau modifications have
been identified, many are conserved across the full range of tauopathies. We do not yet have a deep
understanding of the molecular processes that generate these tau protein modifications, or of their functional
consequences in promoting pathogenic cascades. This knowledge gap is a major contributor to our current
inability to generate effective therapeutic interventions for AD and other tauopathies. The central hypothesis we
are testing here is that a range of pathogenic events induce phosphorylation of tau at specific residues, resulting
in mislocalization of tau within the cell and subsequent synaptic dysfunctions, and that inhibition of these early
tau phosphorylation events will in turn inhibit tau pathologies and associated signaling deficits. This hypothesis
is based on our published work, primarily utilizing cultured cell experimental systems. The direct relevance of
this mechanism to human disease is further supported by the recent finding that phosphorylation of tau at these
same specific residues is an early event preceding tau fibril formation in AD disease progression. Our overall
objective here is to test and further refine this hypothesis in a novel mouse model we have developed (MAPT-
GR) that expresses all isoforms of human tau at physiologic levels and ratios. We have found that mild traumatic
brain injury (mTBI) induces a rapid phosphorylation and somatodendritic mislocalization of the human tau in
these mice. Importantly, we can prevent this tau mislocalization by inhibiting phosphorylation. The specific aims
are to: 1. Determine the dynamic changes in the subcellular distribution of phosphorylated tau. We will
utilize our novel tauopathy model to test the working hypothesis that phosphorylation of tau at specific residues
leads to somatodendritic accumulation of tau, tau mislocalization to dendritic spines, and alters micro-
components of dendritic spines. 2. Determine the synaptic and circuit dysfunctions associated with the
phosphorylation of tau. We will test the working hypothesis that mislocalization of phosphorylated tau to
somatodendritic domains and dendritic spines results in synaptic and circuit dysfunction in our model. 3. Identify
the impact of inhibiting these early phosphorylation events on tau mislocalization and associated
signaling deficits. We will test our working hypothesis that mTBI activates GSK3β and CDK5, which
phosphorylate the B and C domain of the tau protein. Expected Outcomes: We expect to identify the early-stage
pathologies and dysfunctions caused by phosphorylation of tau and provide proof-of-concept demonstrations of
the extent to which these dysfunctions can be prevented by blocking tau phosphorylation at specific residues.
Of equal importance, we expect to have optimized a model and experimental platform in which potential
therapeutic compounds that target this common disease mechanism can be tested and optimized."
10788460,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hispanic/Latino sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are the fastest growing ethnic group of SGM in the U.S.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among Hispanic/Latinos. SGM
inequities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have been identified as early as young adulthood; and minority
stress has been identified as a potential moderator. Yet, small numbers of ethnic minority participants in SGM
studies have precluded examination of the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, and ethnicity.
We propose a cost-effective ancillary study that will leverage existing data from the parent Hispanic
Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) while collecting new data on sexual orientation, gender
identity, stigma, discrimination, stress, coping, social support, and CVD risk. The proposed study is timely
because HCHS/SOL participants will be scheduled for their third in-person visits (V3) starting in November
2019. In this study, we will (1) examine the influence of sexual orientation and gender identity on CVD risk
among all HCHS/SOL participants at V3 (~9300); (2) model pathways from sexual orientation and gender
identity to CVD risk through stigma, discrimination, and stress among a 1:2 matched sub-cohort of SGM and
non-SGM participants at V3 (~1680); and (3) examine the influence of stigma/discrimination on sexual
orientation and CVD risk relationships among sub-cohort participants at V3. Data analysis will follow a
conceptual model derived from the LGBT Minority Stress Model in which excess stigma discrimination against
SGM leads to minority stress that increases CVD risk. In this model, coping and social support serve as
resilience factors that mitigate the impact of minority stress on CVD risk. Cross-sectional and longitudinal
regression models as well as structural equation models will be used to test these relationships. Understanding
the influence of stigma-induced stress on CVD risk among Hispanic/Latino SGM has significant implications for
the development of culturally-specific CVD risk reduction strategies. Study findings will be used to build on
identified Hispanic/Latino cultural strengths to inform adaptation and testing of family and community
acceptance interventions.

10930937,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol is the most widely used substance and the third-leading preventable cause of death in the United
States. Initiation of alcohol use typically occurs in adolescence, and early onset alcohol use (< age 15) has
been associated with prolonged negative outcomes such as increased risk for AUD. The development of
alcohol use and AUD is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, and the complex interactions among
them (i.e., gene-environment interaction or GE). Yet, the majority of genetic and GE research has been 1)
conducted with populations of European ancestry, and 2) focused on alcohol outcomes among individuals who
have already initiated alcohol use or developed AUD. Thus, there is limited understanding of GE processes in
racially-ethnically diverse populations, and how genetic risk manifests earlier in development in order to inform
early prevention and intervention efforts. Furthermore, despite culture being an important context that shapes
human behavior, cultural risk and protective factors have been largely overlooked in GE research. We seek to
advance the understanding of etiology of alcohol use and AUD among racially-ethnically diverse populations
by taking a developmentally and culturally informed approach to study GE processes. This project draws data
from the ongoing Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which includes rich genomic
and phenotypic data from a longitudinal sample (N = 11,875; 52.1% White, 15.0% Black, and 20.3%
Hispanic/Latinx) of racially-ethnically diverse children from late childhood (9-10 years old) through
adolescence. The project examines three research aims. First, we will characterize polygenic influences on
adolescent alcohol use among racially-ethnically diverse youth. Using a genome-wide polygenic score (PRS)
approach, we will examine the effects of multiple adult and child-based PRS for alcohol and related traits (e.g.,
externalizing, internalizing symptoms) on timing of progression through the stages (e.g., experimentation,
initiation, regular use, and problematic use), and trajectories of alcohol use from late childhood to adolescence.
Second, we will examine the role of multiple childhood precursors (i.e., impulsivity, externalizing, and
internalizing symptoms) in mediating polygenic influences on alcohol use. Finally, we will investigate the role of
cultural-contextual risk and protective factors (i.e., parenting, peer deviance, stressful life events, racial
discrimination experiences, familism cultural value) in moderating genetic influences on childhood precursors
and adolescent alcohol use. We will explore how the associations of genetic, cultural-contextual factors,
childhood precursors, and alcohol use change from late childhood to adolescence by examining age and
developmental differences, and exploring differences by sex and pubertal status. Findings will advance alcohol
and health disparities sciences by elucidating developmental and environmental mechanisms linking genetic
risk to alcohol use among racially-ethnically diverse adolescents, providing critical insights for alcohol use
prevention and intervention programs, including who is most at risk, what to target, and when to intervene."
10773150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic heavy ethanol drinking and stress are associated with impaired cognitive flexibility, reflected in habitual
and compulsive drinking. This proposal seeks to improve our understanding of the neural basis of these effects
by combining ex vivo slice electrophysiological studies with non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) measurements on mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) subjects over the course of experimental
drinking procedures common across the INIA-Stress consortium. Electrophysiological recordings of brain slices
have demonstrated that establishment of habitual behaviors, including heavy drinking, involve and increase in
the excitatory to inhibitory tone of neural input (the E/I ratio) to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the mouse
dorsolateral striatum (DLS), which in primates is termed the putamen. Specialized MRS techniques for
quantifying -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate within specific brain regions have led researchers to
propose that the glutamate/GABA ratio reflects E/I, in the context of chronic stress, however the MRS
approach has yet to be validated with direct comparisons to electrophysiological recordings. In Aims 1 and 2,
we propose to use electrophysiology and MRS to study mice undergoing chronic intermittent ethanol exposure,
combined with forced swim stress (CIE-FSS mice). Our experiments will expand our understanding of striatal
neurocircuit adaptations to stress and ethanol exposure by using chemogenetic and recombinant mouse
strains to characterize changes in cortical (excitatory) and parvalbumin-expressing interneuron (inhibitory)
input to DLS MSNs. In the same mice, metabolic allostasis will be characterized with dynamic MRS methods
that monitor cerebral glucose metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis to estimate the neural tricarboxcylic
acid cycle rate (VTCA) in real time, to provide a biochemical context for interpreting glutamate/GABA ratios,
which will also be measured in these mice. In Aim 3, parallel chemogenetic manipulations and
electrophysiological recordings will be performed in NHP subjects following schedule-induced polydipsia and
open-access drinking. These measures will be directly compared to MRS determinations of glutamate/GABA
and VTCA within the putamen. Together, these results will support the development of non-invasive strategies to
measure stress and ethanol-induced changes in striatal neurocircuitry associated with the establishment of
heavy drinking behaviors. The cross-species approach will contribute reliability to the conclusions to be drawn,
and enhance the translatability of this work to future application in human subjects."
10773161,"Catherine Forster, MD, MS is a pediatrician in hospital medicine whose overarching career goal is to be a
world-recognized leader on UTIs in children with neuropathic bladder.
Research: Despite the importance of urinary tract infections (UTIs) to health outcomes in children with
neuropathic bladders, there are currently no methods to accurately diagnose UTIs in this population. This
proposal will begin to fill that gap. The goals of this proposal are to identify children who should be tested for a
UTI, develop a highly specific diagnostic method for UTI using mouse models, and translate these results into
a pilot cohort of children. These goals will be attained through completion of the following specific aims: 1)
Develop an algorithm based on clinical characteristics to determine the probability of UTI in children with spina
bifida; 2) Identify the relationship between urine microbial diversity and urinary biomarkers in mouse models of
neuropathic bladder; and 3) Explore the association between UTI and urobiome diversity and/or urine
biomarkers in children with spina bifida. Aim 1 will be completed through use of data from the multi-institutional
Urologic Management to Preserve Initial Renal Function Protocol for Young Children with Spina Bifida study.
Aim 2 will use both genetic and surgical mouse models of neuropathic bladder. In Aim 3, the urobiome and
urine biomarkers will be measured in symptomatic children with spina bifida.
Career Development: Together with her mentors, Dr. Carl Bates and Dr. Nader Shaikh, Dr. Forster has
created a career development plan built upon her prior training that is designed to address the areas where
she requires additional training: Gain additional knowledge around mouse bladder studies and genetic models
of bladder disease, create and maintain a mouse colony, gain experience with interpretation of urodynamic
data, develop working knowledge of bioinformatic approaches to analyze 16S rRNA sequencing data, and
develop expertise with recruiting and collecting prospective urine samples from a cohort of pediatric patients.
The proposed training plan will provide Dr. Forster with the necessary skills to validate the results of this work.
Environment: This research will take place within the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP). The proposed
career development plan utilizes the intellectual resources available through the University of Pittsburgh and
CHP, including the Center for Microbiome and Medicine, and nationally recognized seminars and courses.
Summary: This proposed innovative research will expand the evidence base for the diagnosis of UTI in
children with spina bifida. Aligned with NIDDK’s mission, this work will be an important contribution to
improving the health of children with neuropathic bladders. Dr. Forster's research and clinical training, prior
research experiences, and dedicated mentorship team make her ideally suited to pursue this research. This
award will facilitate Dr. Forster’s continued development into an independent investigator in the conduct of
research of the optimizing the care and outcomes of children with neuropathic bladders."
10747361,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A growing body of evidence suggests that growth factors (GFs), once considered to function mainly in
development, also regulate synaptic plasticity and memory in the adult. This proposal reflects on an ongoing
research program in our laboratory that has focused on the role of GFs in memory formation. The primary
focus of this current project is to examine GF-mediated memory formation from a novel perspective, which
takes into account the temporal aspect of their activity as part of the cellular computation involved in forming
memories.
Repeated-trial learning, a fundamental form of memory acquisition exhibited by virtually all animals, including
man, requires a temporal interaction between an ongoing stimulus and the delayed effects of a previous
stimulus. We will use a powerful paradigm to study repeated-trial training in the marine mollusk Aplysia, which
develops long-term memory (LTM) for sensitization after only two training trials, but only if they are separated
by a permissive and surprisingly specific time interval of ~45 min. This minimal system clearly separates the
initiating stimulus (Trial 1) from the repeated stimulus (Trial 2), providing unparalleled access to the temporal
interactions underlying repeated-trial LTM. We will investigate two GF-dependent mechanisms that our
preliminary evidence suggests contribute significantly to temporal processing at the heart of repeated-trial
learning. The first (explored in AIM 1) is a distributed mechanism for GF-dependent phosphorylation of
extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK). The second mechanism (explored in AIM 2) is the multi-step signaling
of a specific GF, TGFβ, which we propose similarly integrates the timing of training trials. Finally, in AIM 3 we
will try to establish causal connections between the timing of single ERK phosphorylation, TGFβ availability,
and the persistent effects of two-trial training
The project holds promise for significant impact from both a basic scientific perspective and a clinical
perspective. From a basic scientific perspective, Aplysia provides an exceptional experimental system that has
the potential to demonstrate causal linkages between GF-mediated memory formation and its underlying
synaptic and molecular mechanisms, while simultaneously exploring the temporal features of those
mechanisms. And from a clinical perspective, the impact of this project addresses a major challenge in mental
health: to understand and treat the devastating cognitive disorders that accompany neurodegenerative
diseases. GF signaling has been directly implicated in many of these diseases and, since GFs are extracellular
proteins, understanding when and where they act in the brain during memory formation could provide novel
strategies for developing more specific and more effective therapeutic agents."
10747362,"Metastatic breast cancer (BC) is a major health issue for women across the world. About 40,610 women and 460
men in the US are expected to die this year alone from BC. While there are numerous treatment options for hormone
receptor positive (HR+) and HER2+ BC patients, the standard of care for triple negative BC (TNBC) patients largely
relies on conventional chemotherapy and radiation. Improved options for treating metastatic BC represent a vast
unmet medical need. Recently, several clinical trials investigated combined treatment with either HR pathway
blockers or HER2 antagonists and PI3K inhibitors, since the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated or mutated in
over 50% of BC patients. However, the results have shown only 2-4 months increase in progression free survival and
there is extensive Grade 3 and 4 toxicity with the dosage schedules used. The discovery of immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) is revolutionizing cancer therapy, but thus far BC patients are not showing strong responses to ICI
therapy, due to low mutational load and minimal infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (“cold”).
 Our hypothesis is that response to ICI therapy in immunologically “cold” BCs can be enhanced by combining
therapies that inhibit AKT with paclitaxel (PTX) to induce immunogenic tumor cell death and shift tumor-associated
immune cells to an anti-tumor phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize immune competent mouse models,
organoid/immune cell co-cultures, and humanized mouse models bearing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) to
determine if PI3K pathway inhibitors, when enhance response to ICIs, and improve survival in mice. There are two
specific aims. Aim 1. To develop the optimal strategy for reducing growth of TNBC through treatment with an AKT
inhibitor, ipatasertib, combined with paclitaxel, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) anti-CTLA4 + anti-PD1. Using
immune competent mouse models, we will determine the functional significance of reprograming the tumor immune
environment in mammary tumors in response to AKT inhibition in reference to response to ICIs at early, mid and late
time points during therapy. Mechanisms of therapeutic response will be investigated based upon analysis of the
following parameters: toxicity; tumor growth; metastasis; immune cell content (immunome); cytokine/chemokine
expression profile in tumor, bone marrow, lung and blood samples; angiogenesis; and transcriptome in responding
and non- responding tumors. State of the art technology will include multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow
cytometry, CyTOF, reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA), RNA sequencing (RNAseq), DNA sequencing (DNAseq)
and pathway analysis. Transcriptomic and immunome signatures predicting response to treatment in mice will be
compared to RNAseq data from ongoing clinical trials available to us and published “response signatures” 26. Aim 2:
To determine the efficacy of treatment with AKT inhibitors combined with PTX and ICIs in two human TNBC models:
1) organoid co-cultures human TNBC plus fibroblasts, endothelial cells and patient immune cells: 2) humanized
patient-derived xenografts (PDX) mouse models established from TNBC patients. Genetic/immunome signatures will
be evaluated and compared to data from ongoing clinical trials."
10747386,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myelination in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) is an evolutionarily conserved process where
oligodendrocytes (OLs), a glial cell type within the CNS, wrap surrounding axons in membrane sheaths providing
vital trophic support and insulation. This incredibly complex and dynamic process of myelination occurs
throughout life, both in response to injury and as a continuous refinement of circuit dynamics. A previous forward
genetic screen in zebrafish, aimed at identifying novel regulators of myelination, identified Fbwx7 as a negative
regulator of CNS myelination. Fbxw7 is a recognition subunit of the SKP1-Cullin-Fbox (SCF) ubiquitin ligase
complex. Loss of Fbxw7 resulted in a significant increase in myelin basic protein (mbp) expression, the number
of OL lineage cells, and an increase in the number of myelinated axons and myelin wraps in the dorsal spinal
cord of zebrafish. Additionally, loss of Fbxw7 in mature myelinating OLs in the mouse optic nerve resulted in a
significant increase in the density of abnormally thick myelinated axons, myelin outfoldings, and degenerating
axons, showing for the first time a role for Fbxw7 in regulating myelin homeostasis in the mammalian CNS. To
determine the substrates that Fbxw7 might be regulating to control CNS myelination, I silenced Fbxw7 in primary
OL cultures, and found a significant increase in the levels of the transcription factor Myelin Regulator Factor
(Myrf), a key protein essential for myelination, and many novel proteins. I hypothesize that Fbxw7 controls CNS
myelination by degrading protein substrates that regulate OPC proliferation, differentiation, and/or OL sheath
length and myelin thickness. To investigate this, I will 1) examine OL development and dynamics in Fbxw7 loss
of function zebrafish mutants and in OL lineage specific Cre mouse models, and 2) determine Fbxw7 substrates
that regulate OL development and myelination using zebrafish genetics and rodent culture models. By combining
these approaches, I will receive training in a diverse array of experimental methods and model systems, providing
me with skills and options to pursue a successful career in science. Additionally, my co-appointment in Dr. Ben
Emery’s (Jungers Center for Neuroscience Research) and Dr. Kelly Monk’s (Vollum institute) laboratories will
provide me with institutional support from two exemplary departments and access to a large group of diverse
PIs and trainees to aid in my scientific growth and training."

The current request for CCSG funding is targeted to emerging opportunities at Dartmouth in active faculty
recruitments, Members’ collaborative pilot projects, and new research Shared Resource service capabilities.
Since 2014, NCCC has contributed to the start-up funding of 13 newly recruited Dartmouth faculty, all of whom
now are aligned strategically as Members in NCCC Programs. The sole recipient of CCSG funds, Dr. Miller,
had a 92:1 return on investment, and the broader group of ten recipients of non-CCSG seed funding more than
one-year ago still had an impressive 10:1 return on investment. We have a rigorous pilot project selection
process, as exemplified by the total of 161 applications in the current award period leading to 66 project
awards (41%). In the current reporting period, 18 pilot project applications received a total of $704,104 in
CCSG Developmental Funding. For the 12 awards ($529,212) that have completed their one-year seed
funding period, 12 publications have resulted and $4,349,850 in peer-reviewed ($4,549,850 in total)
subsequent direct cost funding has been secured, an 8:1 peer-reviewed direct cost return on investment. For
the larger portfolio of CCSG, ACS, and philanthropic-funded pilot projects, with 52 awards in the review period
($2,443,546) that have completed their one-year seed funding period, 68 publications have resulted and

 Approximately 30% of U.S. adults have high blood pressure. Of particular concern, the prevalence of
hypertension-related deaths increased 23% from 2000 to 2013, which correlates with a concurrent increase in
the prevalence in obesity during this time. Adiposity increases an individual's risk for a number of diseases,
including hypertension and heart disease. Accordingly, high fat diet-induced hypertension is currently a
significant public health concern and a high priority. Thus, there is a critical need to elucidate the mechanisms
driving the development of adiposity-associated hypertension. Our preliminary data demonstrate that there is a
large immune cell population in perivascular adipose tissue and that there is a greater number of immune cells
per mg tissue in PVAT as compared to other adipose tissues. Furthermore, our data also demonstrate that the
PVAT microenvironment influences immune cell function. In particular, our results show mPVAT conditioned
media from healthy rats suppresses IL-2 secretion by activated T cells, which suggests that under homeostatic
conditions the PVAT microenvironment may serve to buffer T cell activation. Conversely, mPVAT conditioned
media from rats on a HF diet promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as GM-CSF, IFNγ
and IL-17a, by activated T cells. Notably, these effects are observed prior to the development of hypertension.
RNA-sequencing of the PVAT from these rats revealed a substantial increase in the expression of DPP-4, a
peptidase that acts as a costimulatory factor in T cells. We also found that DPP-4-specific inhibitors mitigated
the increase in IL-17a by PVAT-CM from HF diet-fed rats. These exciting preliminary results have led to our
central hypothesis that the PVAT microenvironment controls inflammation during homeostasis, while
conversely promoting inflammation early during the development of high fat diet-induced hypertension. We
propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1. Determine the mechanism by which
PVAT promotes a pro-inflammatory environment early during the development of HF diet-induced
hypertension, while maintaining a semi-quiescent environment during health. We hypothesize that activation
of PPARγ by endogenous ligands causes inhibition of IL-2 secretion during homeostasis, whereas induction of
DPP-4 plays a role in promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production during high fat diet-induced
hypertension. and 2. Determine the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the development of HFD-induced
hypertension and inflammation. We propose to perform T cell depletion in combination with adoptive transfers
to determine the role of T cells in high fat diet-induced hypertension."

10772562,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Venous thromboembolism is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The contact pathway
of coagulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism. However, there are few
studies on regulation of this pathway by endogenous anticoagulants. C1 inhibitor is a multifunctional serine
protease inhibitor that functions as a major endogenous inhibitor of kallikrein, factor XII and factor XI. Patients
with a congenital deficiency in C1 inhibitor suffer from a rare episodic swelling disorder called Hereditary
Angioedema. Critically, patients with Hereditary Angioedema have evidence of increased systemic activation of
coagulation. We recently reported that Hereditary Angioedema is associated with a significantly increased risk
of venous thromboembolism in a small case-control study. Further, we have found that Hereditary Angioedema
patient plasmas support significantly increased contact pathway-mediated coagulation. Importantly, this
phenotype could be recapitulated in C1 inhibitor deficient mice that model key aspects of Hereditary
Angioedema. Our preliminary data indicates that aberrant contact pathway-mediated coagulation and enhanced
venous thrombosis observed in C1-inhibitor deficient mice can be rescued by select anticoagulant interventions.
Additional preliminary data indicates that exogenous C1 inhibitor effectively reduces contact pathway-mediated
coagulation and venous thrombosis in C1 inhibitor replete settings. Our central hypothesis is that C1 inhibitor
prevents venous thrombosis through inhibition of contact pathway-mediated coagulation. In Aim 1 of this
proposal, we will evaluate the molecular mechanism by which endogenous C1 inhibitor regulates coagulation
and venous thrombosis in mice using substrate selective C1 inhibitor variants and an arsenal of pharmacological
inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the impact of C1INH deficiency on coagulation and thrombosis in patients
with Hereditary Angioedema using patient samples and a large-scale epidemiological dataset. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate the therapeutic potential of exogenous C1 inhibitor in mouse models of thrombosis. The work proposed
will provide new insights into the anticoagulant activity of endogenous C1 inhibitor and the potential of exogenous
C1 inhibitor to serve as a novel hemostasis sparing anticoagulant."

oncology health professional students, trainees, and faculty since 2016. These activities highly impact each of
the five research Programs and span the education continuum, from primary school students to faculty, and
throughout all scientific disciplines. CRTEC’s overarching goal is to foster the best talent in a diverse pipeline of
cancer researchers and oncology professionals. Strategic focus areas are developing advanced support for
fellowship and training grant submissions, enhancing diverse recruitment at all career stages, expanding
educational integration in the catchment area, and supporting new initiatives through four Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To coordinate educational operations and multi-institutional collaborations.
Aim 2: To expand the tracking of all trainees and education activities.
Aim 3: To facilitate career mentorship and career development activities that enable trainees and faculty to
maximize their career potential.
Aim 4: To expand diversity and health equity in the career development pipeline through internal and external
education, peer networking, and proactive recruitment.
CRTEC is a key area of the Research Strategic Plan, evidenced by consolidation of the educational structure
into two integrated offices, Research Education & Training (RET) and Office of Clinical Education (OCE), under
the ACD of Research Education & Training. Together, the RET/OCE offices coordinate all educational activities

CANCER BIOLOGY & EVOLUTION PROGRAM
The Cancer Biology & Evolution (CBE) Program is focused on understanding tumor initiation, progression,
metastasis and therapy resistance from an evolutionary perspective. CBE research is conducted at the interface
of molecular cancer biology, translational research and mathematical modeling with a focus on priority cancers
in Moffitt’s catchment area. This innovative Program emerged from our recognition that cancers are complex,
multi-scale, and open dynamic systems. Given the interdisciplinary approaches required to combat such
complexity, mathematicians, computer scientists, cancer biologists, and clinicians were recruited to CBE to
challenge the long-held belief that “cancer is too complicated to model,” Notably, CBE adopted the principles of
evolution as a central driver that governs all aspects of cancer biology as well as the response to therapies.
While CBE supports traditional discovery biomedical studies that have successfully defined new pathways and
effectors that contribute to the development, progression and metastasis of cancer, CBE uniquely integrates
these data into theoretical frameworks organized around evolutionary first principles that are facilitated by
sophisticated mathematical models. Accordingly, the overarching goals of CBE are to define the complex multi-
scale dynamics that govern the biology and therapeutic responses of cancer through the lens of evolution, and
to deliver new agents and strategies for the prevention and treatment of metastatic, refractory or relapsed
malignancies. To achieve its goals, CBE research is organized into three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To define networks operational in cancer development and progression.
Aim 2: To develop animal and mathematical models of human cancer development, progression, metastasis
and therapeutic resistance.
Aim 3: To translate basic discoveries into personalized modeled therapies.
CBE has flourished since its inception in 2012, where multidisciplinary teams have driven major scientific
advances at the interface of cancer biology, evolution, mathematical modeling and clinical research. This
success is underscored by a robust funding portfolio including 19 multi-PI grants (U54, T32, & 8 U01s) and first-
in-kind Adaptive Therapy clinical trials that have shown remarkable benefit in refractory and metastatic disease.
In addition, two research teams with pending P01 applications have emerged that are focused on identifying
metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer and developing evolutionary therapy for cancer. Together, the 37 CBE
Members have 23 cancer-focused R01 grant equivalents, $9.6M in annual grant direct costs ($7.4M peer-
reviewed), and 656 publications since 2016. Future priorities of CBE are to use state-of-the-art GEMM,
mathematical modeling, and machine learning to deconvolute cancer cell-intrinsic and extrinsic control of
signaling and metabolic circuits in the progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance of cancer, and to foster
the rollout of new first-in-kind adaptive therapy clinical trials that reduce cancer morbidity and improve outcomes."

CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY PROGRAM
The goal of the Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) Cancer Epidemiology (CE) Program is to reduce cancer burden
through better knowledge of exposures, their biological markers, and underlying mechanisms, and to translate
learned knowledge to inform advances in clinical and public health practice. CE Program Members use robust
methodologic and analytic approaches that incorporate a broad array of biomarkers and integrative methods to
conduct population-level research that informs the etiology of cancer while recognizing the many aspects of
heterogeneity in this diverse group of diseases. The innovative research of the CE Program extends across the
cancer continuum from cancer risk to interception and early detection to cancer outcomes covering primary,
secondary, and tertiary prevention, with an intentional focus on those cancers that heavily impact Moffitt’s
catchment area. CE Members strive to translate their research findings to inform change in clinical or public
health practice and policy, and to shift cancer prevention and treatment paradigms. To achieve these goals, CE
Program research is organized into three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To discover inherited susceptibility markers of cancer risk, determine their function, and leverage this
information for precision prevention.
Aim 2: To identify and validate non-genetic exposures and their biomarkers affecting tumor development,
progression, and outcome, and use this knowledge to develop actionable cancer prevention strategies.
Aim 3: To investigate features of tumors and premalignant conditions that influence early detection, progression,
and outcomes and capitalize on these findings to inform novel clinical approaches.
The CE Program consists of 26 faculty from eight academic departments. Peer-reviewed funding is $6.6M in
annual direct costs, with $3.6M from the NCI. This reflects 16 R01/R01-equivalent grants. Members published
905 cancer-relevant scholarly articles (123 high impact; impact factor ³ 10). CE Members hold 10 peer-reviewed
MPI awards and have accrued 2,371 participants onto intervention trials since 2016. Scientific investigations led
by Members have helped advance knowledge of biological factors – including common medicines; human
papilloma virus, HIV, and other viruses; genetic polymorphisms; and radiogenomic signatures – for multiple
cancers that are major contributors to mortality and morbidity in Moffitt’s catchment area. Notably, translational
impact of CE Members includes changes in HPV-vaccination policy, updates for the interpretation of ovarian and
breast cancer genetic testing results, and guideline changes for genetic testing protocols for melanoma-prone
families. CE Members also are currently engaged in chemoprevention trials in prostate and lung cancer, aspirin
trials in ovarian cancer, developing radiogenomic signatures in lung and pancreatic cancer, and identifying race-
specific gene expression profiles in prostate cancer to impact clinical and public health."
10783691,"PROJECT 1: Role of fat in metastatic engraftment and expansion in the liver
ABSTRACT
The metastasis of solid tumors to the liver may be a result of acquisition of features that enable survival within a
supportive metastatic niche. We found that the liver niche is generally not conducive to the expansion of prostate
cancer. However, feeding host mice with a high-fat diet for two weeks was sufficient to enable prostate cancer
growth in the liver. Similarly, pancreatic and colon cancer cells demonstrated greater expansion if the mice were
fed a high-fat diet versus if they were given a low-fat diet. The exposure of hepatocytes and cancer epithelial
cells to a saturated fatty acid, palmitate, was found to promote the expression of transforming growth factor-
β/bone morphogenic protein co-receptor, endoglin, as well as their ligands. We found that prostate cancer
epithelial expression of CD36, a pro-metastatic fatty acid receptor, is dependent on endoglin signaling in the
context of circulating fat. Based on these novel findings, we tested if neutralizing endoglin signaling affected liver
metastasis, and found that differential endoglin signaling in hepatocytes and cancer epithelial cells could
cooperatively contribute to liver metastasis. We hypothesize that circulating fat can convert the otherwise
metastasis-inhibitory liver microenvironment to be tumor-permissive, and that it can promote epithelial cell
survival in the liver in an endoglin-dependent manner. In Aim 1, we will define endoglin-associated changes in
the liver that enable metastatic engraftment. We will systematically determine how fat affects endoglin-mediated
expression of glutamine synthetase by hepatocytes and its effects on hepatic stellate cell activation in support
of prostate, pancreatic, and colon cancer liver engraftment. In Aim 2, we will identify the role of circulating fat on
tumor epithelial cells with regard to liver engraftment. We will explore the nature of endoglin-CD36 crosstalk in
cancer epithelial cells, and how it promotes the Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling axis associated with
metastasis-enabling properties downstream of FOXM1. In Aim 3, we will identify the role that fatty acids have
on the expansion of tumor epithelial cells within the liver niche. We will study the liver ecosystem with signaling
interactions perpetuated by fat in hepatocytes and cancer epithelial cells. We identified that fat induces glutamine
synthesis by hepatocytes in an endoglin-dependent manner. The mechanism by which hepatocyte-derived
glutamine induces hepatic stellate cell activation and cancer epithelial differentiation will be elucidated. We will
test a reciprocal relationship between the liver and tumor epithelial cells, as fat impacts circulating cancer cells
and those disseminated to the liver."

HEALTH OUTCOMES & BEHAVIOR PROGRAM
The overarching goal of the Health Outcomes & Behavior (HOB) Program is to improve cancer outcomes by
understanding and intervening on the behavior of individuals, social networks, healthcare systems, and
communities. Supporting this goal, HOB research activities are organized into three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To reduce the burden of tobacco-related cancers by understanding mechanisms of addiction, and by
developing and implementing evidence-based interventions to reduce tobacco use across diverse populations.
Aim 2: To improve utilization of cancer prevention and detection services through the development and
implementation of multi-level interventions targeting patient-, provider-, systems-, and community-level barriers
and facilitators.
Aim 3: To improve the quality of survivorship through innovative research that identifies and intervenes on
the short- and long-term physical and psychological effects of cancer and its treatment.
The impact of research in the three Aims is manifest through two cross-cutting themes that seek to: 1) improve
healthcare delivery for cancer prevention and treatment; and 2) reduce cancer-related health disparities across
diverse populations.
HOB is comprised of 28 Members from 8 different academic departments. Since 2016, 554 cancer-related
articles were published, with 30% representing intra-programmatic collaborations and 25% representing inter-
programmatic collaborations. Notably, since the last renewal, the number of NIH R01 grants with HOB PIs has
doubled from 5 to 10, including 9 from NCI. HOB Members hold a total of 14 qualifying R01/equivalent grants.
Grant funding is $5.7 million in direct costs, of which $4.5 million is peer-reviewed, including 57% from NCI. HOB
is also strongly committed to multi-institute research and has also increased multi-site studies from 10 to 17.
HOB Program Members conduct policy-changing observational and intervention research on the major cancers
that affect the catchment area and vulnerable populations with respect to prevention, screening, quality of life,
and cancer care delivery. Additionally, HOB Members conduct community-based participatory research in
concert with organizations in the catchment area with the goal of reducing health disparities through multi-level
practice changes. Synergistic goals over the next five years include expanding partnerships with community
cancer care providers and other health centers in our catchment area, expanding cancer care delivery research
and implementation science, and increasing the HOB research portfolio in energy balance for cancer prevention
and control. By collaborating with colleagues from other Programs and institutions, HOB Members conduct
translational research that is driving scientific discovery, establishing public health policies, and transforming
patient care delivery, practice, and quality of life."
10783693,"PROJECT 2: Fatty Liver Predisposes to Metastasis: Role of Hepatic Stellate Cells
PROJECT SUMMARY
The central hypothesis being tested by this Program project is that the normal liver has defense mechanisms
to suppress metastatic growth, which are lowered by insults to the liver microenvironment to allow metastatic
engraftment and expansion. Project 2 focuses on the role of fatty liver in liver metastasis, examining the
hypothesis that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associates with a tumor-promoting liver
microenvironment that is mediated by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), hyaluronic acids (HAs), and hepatocyte-
derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Obesity and NAFLD are serious health concerns that increase the risk of
primary cancers including liver, pancreas, colon, prostate, and breast. Fatty liver also supports liver metastasis
in patients as well as in rodent models. The liver is the most frequent site for metastasis of visceral cancers
such as colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The extent of liver metastasis is a
major survival determinant for patients with these cancers as well as for those with prostate cancer (PCa). The
objective of Project 2, thus, is to investigate molecular mechanism(s) underlying HSC-mediated, enhanced
metastatic growth in the fatty liver environment.
In liver, HSCs are precursors of liver myofibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such
as HAs. Both HSCs and the ECM are elemental in supporting a liver tumor microenvironment. This research
team's preliminary data show that HSC infiltration and ECM production (as evidenced by HAs) in metastatic
tumors were increased in a fatty liver environment. In contrast to previous studies showing that primary tumor-
derived EVs travel to the liver to create a pre-metastatic niche, we propose the innovative hypothesis that a
pro-metastatic liver microenvironment is instead facilitated by non-cancerous, steatotic hepatocytes that
secrete EVs containing pro-fibrogenic and oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs).
This project will examine liver metastasis in fatty liver for three different cancer types (CRC, PDAC, and PCa)
via three specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate whether HSC-derived HA promotes metastatic liver tumor growth
in fatty liver with HSC-specific deletion or overexpression of HA synthase 2 (Has2), in the presence of high-fat
diet (HFD). Aim 2 will investigate whether HA overexpression in fatty liver promotes metastatic tumor growth
via CD44, Notch1, and Yes-associated protein (YAP). Aim 3 will investigate whether fatty liver-derived EVs
promote cancer metastasis to the liver by activating tumor-promoting pathways via oncogenic miRNAs. We will
also seek EV-miRNAs as biomarkers to predict patients at high risk for liver metastasis. This project integrates
with others in the Program by examining associations between fatty liver-mediated HAS2 overexpression and
YAP (Projects 1, 3) and methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A, Project 4)."

IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY PROGRAM
The overarching goal of the Immuno-Oncology Program (IO) is to develop, mechanistically understand and
deliver effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients, with a focus on cancers that disproportionately
affect patients in our catchment area. Key to success of the IO Program is the integration and synergy of basic
and translational immunologists with clinicians implementing clinical trials through an interdisciplinary, “bench-
to-bed-and-back” continuum. Moffitt has become a leader in state-of-the-art immunotherapy trials and to build
upon this success, the research activities of IO are organized into three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To understand molecular and cellular mechanisms that exploit innate and adaptive immunity
against cancer. Specific areas of focus include: 1) dissecting novel immune checkpoint inhibitory pathways
and their crosstalk with other immunosuppressive mechanisms; 2) understanding coordinated cellular and
humoral responses against cancer; and 3) defining metabolic alterations in innate and adaptive immune cells.
Aim 2: To elucidate and target pathways governing effectiveness, resistance, and toxicity in anti-
cancer immunotherapy. Specific areas of focus are: 1) providing biological and clinical insights into how to
augment responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors; 2) identifying actionable epigenetic mechanisms that
govern malignant progression and the effectiveness of immunotherapies; and 3) improving the effectiveness of
bone marrow transplant while reducing graft versus host disease.
Aim 3: To develop and implement anti-cancer cellular therapies. Specific areas of focus include targeting
high priority cancers in our catchment area (e.g., melanoma, lung, cervical and ovarian cancer) by: 1)
developing, implementing and refining CAR T cell therapies against human cancers, including solid
malignancies; and 2) effectively treating cancer through ex vivo expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
IO has made huge impact in immuno-oncology, where IO Members have: 1) led efforts resulting in FDA
approval of CAR T cells for treatment of refractory B cell lymphoma; 2) pioneered the use of TILs to achieve
therapeutic responses in melanoma, and in chemo- and immunotherapy-resistant lung cancer; 3) discovered a
novel targetable checkpoint inhibitory pathway in human cancer; and 4) driven changes in clinical management
of CAR T and checkpoint inhibitor patients. Publications during this cycle include 136 manuscripts in journals
with IF ³ 10, including NEJM, Science, Nature, Lancet Oncology, Cancer Cell and Immunity, among others. IO
is comprised of 36 Members from 9 academic departments. During the reporting period, 648 cancer-related
articles were published, with 21% intra-programmatic and 46% inter-programmatic collaboration rates. Current
grant funding for IO is $19.3 million, of which $6.8 million is peer-reviewed, including 37% from NCI (a 36.6%
increase compared to the previous cycle). Finally, IO has accrued 2,217 patients onto interventional clinical
trials over the last five years."
10783698,"PROJECT 4: Targeting Methionine Adenosyltransferases in Liver Metastasis
ABSTRACT
A key central hypothesis for this Program is that the normal liver has defense mechanisms to suppress metastatic
growth. Project 4 is focused on the role of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) proteins, with MAT1A
defending against liver metastasis, while MAT2A and MAT2B break down this defense. MAT catalyzes the
formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the methyl donor. The MAT1A and MAT2A genes encode MAT α1
and α2 catalytic subunits, respectively; a third gene, MAT2B, encodes the β subunit that regulates the MAT2A-
encoded enzyme. MAT1A, expressed in normal liver, is downregulated in liver diseases, whereas MAT2A and
MAT2B, expressed in non-hepatic tissues, are overexpressed in multiple human cancers. Preliminary data show
that Mat1a knockout (KO) mice are highly sensitized to develop liver metastasis and release extracellular
vesicles that contain oncoproteins; whereas MAT2A/MAT2B have a reciprocal inhibition interplay with
metastasis-inhibiting tumor suppressor miRNAs miR-34a and miR-34b, but have a positive feed-forward loop
with the metastasis-promoting oncogene Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). In contrast, MAT1A and FOXM1 negatively
regulate each other. Project 4 examines the effect of three molecules that target these interplays to inhibit liver
metastasis: SAMe; its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA); and the FOXM1 inhibitor FDI-6. This project tests
the hypothesis that high MAT2A/2B expression in cancer cells enhances liver metastasis by lowering hepatic
MAT1A, and that SAMe, MTA, and FDI-6 inhibit liver metastasis in part by targeting MAT proteins. Importantly,
human livers with metastatic cancers have lower MAT1A expression and the GEO database shows metastatic
colon, pancreatic and prostate cancers have higher MAT2A/2B expression. Core B will provide human
specimens and animal models to examine these MAT proteins in liver metastases from colon, pancreas, and
prostate cancers over three specific aims: Aim 1. Examine the role of hepatic MAT1A expression in liver
metastasis. This aim will test the hypothesis that loss of MAT1A alters extracellular vesicle content released by
the liver to enhance metastatic growth. Aim 2. Determine if MAT proteins expressed by the cancer influence
liver metastasis. This aim will elucidate the mechanisms responsible for MAT2A/MAT2B-mediated regulation
of miR-34a/b and FOXM1, and examine whether higher MAT2A/2B expression in cancer cells enhance liver
metastasis. Aim 3. Examine mechanisms and therapeutic potential of SAMe, MTA, and FDI-6 in liver
metastasis. This aim will assess the effects of these three molecules (individually and combined) on cancer cell
migration and invasion in vitro. The best therapy will be verified in vivo using mouse models and orthotopic
patient-derived xenografts established using tissues from patients with liver metastasis. Project 4 synergizes
with: Project 1, as endoglin/BMP signaling activates FOXM1, Project 2, as MAT1A expression falls in fatty liver
and Mat1a KO livers have higher hyaluronic acid; and Project 3, as Metavert lowers MAT2A expression.
Successful completion will define clearly the role of MAT proteins in liver metastasis."
10788357,"The Translational Imaging and Behavioral Assessment (TIBA) Core will provide state of the art infrastructure for preclinical translational imaging studies using optical and other modalities to study neural structure and activity as well as cognitive assessment in translational models for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. This core will be composed of a preclinical imaging center which bundles several small animal imaging modalities. These include Multiphoton Microscopy, 7T MRI and a new PET scanner, allowing multimodal imaging in animal models for the study of normative cognition and neurocognitive disorders. This approach will result in innovative and rigorous preclinical translational datasets that are more powerful than the individual standalone imaging modalities. A second component of Core C, in keeping with the theme of the CoNDA center of cognitive assessments, is the new rodent behavior core. This core will provide the center with the expertise, equipment, and space that is required to conduct innovative behavioral research. A wide array of cognitive and behavioral assessments would dove-tail with the in vivo imaging experiments in the preclinical imaging center."
10788400,"Core E: Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core: Abstract:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an
enormous public health problem and its increasing prevalence demands a concomitant increase in AD-related
outreach, research recruitment, and community engagement. In response to a local needs assessment and
calls for action at the state (PA State Alzheimer’s Plan) and federal (National Alzheimer’s Project Act) levels,
we have identified the following specific aims for the proposed period of support: Aim 1) To sustain effective
and initiate new community engagement activities that are responsive to local stakeholder needs and address
regional and national priorities in Alzheimer’s disease research and care; Aim 2) To facilitate recruitment of
diverse participants at the earliest end of the AD spectrum into the Clinical Core and ancillary studies; and Aim
3) To train health professionals and students of the health sciences in the diagnosis of persons at the earliest
end of the ADRD spectrum with an emphasis on translating a) cutting edge biomarker research and b)
emerging evidence regarding the heterogeneous nature of AD and evidence-based treatment approaches to
community based providers of the present and future. We will achieve these interrelated aims through a
research strategy that includes innovative programming and builds on our biggest successes over the past
several years. Primary examples of planned activities for Aim 1 include partnering with key civic and social
service organizations, maintaining a community advisory council, developing neighborhood-based engagement
programs ranging from a lecture series in a community auditorium to AD “pop ups” in Black owned and
operated establishments. Examples for Aim 2 include overhauling our recruitment messaging to consistently
highlight the research participation narratives of African Americans in the Clinic Core and weaving such
narratives into a wide range of digital and print materials. The primary foci of Aim 3 are developing and
delivering on-site interprofessional clinical training, as well as continuing education programs to larger
professional audiences in partnership with UPMC, the Alzheimer’s Association and the University’s HRSA-
funded Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Project (Aim 3). These and other elements of our research strategy
will be evaluated on an ongoing basis using such methods as tracking the number and characteristics of
participants in our programs (community, student, and professional), administering feedback forms and/or pre-
post activity surveys to each group of learners, and monitoring the number of individuals who sign up to
receive information or be contacted by the PITT-ADRC either following community presentations, or as a result
of specific partnerships with community groups, providers, and other research collaborators."
10788405,"Recruitment and Education Component: Summary/Abstract:
The primary goal of the Research Education
Component (REC) is to identify, attract, and promote the career development of ADRD investigators. The
PITT-ADRC REC assumes primary responsibility for executing the Center’s bold vision for advancing the
ADRD research workforce with a particular emphasis on cultivating the growth of our field’s future leaders.
The inclusion and promotion of junior investigators in multiple areas of dementia research within our PITT-
ADRC is an important responsibility of our senior faculty.
 With over a dozen federally funded training programs (T32s) in the neurosciences and/or aging, the
University of Pittsburgh has the infrastructure for scientific mentoring and a critical mass of trainees – both
basic and clinical – with an interest in ADRD research. Through participation in the aforementioned training
programs and/or one-on-one mentorship by a senior investigator, early stage investigators at Pitt have many
excellent opportunities to develop their skills in clinical and basic research methodology, grant writing, and
manuscript preparation. We plan to leverage these existing resources for career development at the University
of Pittsburgh by providing an additional centralized program of ADRD-specific research mentoring and an
innovative pathway for the development ADRD research leadership through the Optimizing Scientific Careers
in AD Research (OSCAR) scholars program.
 The REC is tightly integrated with the Center’s cores. We view research training through a primarily
apprenticeship model, where the trainees develop through one on one work with their mentors, many of whom
are participating faculty in other cores of the ADRC. The REC will enhance the research education occurring in
the cores by coordinating trainee-wide activities, individualizing curriculum (especially in matching clinical
research activities), and devoting administrative support to organizing events, matching mentees with mentors,
and developing centralized resources for navigating the complex clinical research and regulatory environment
of ADRD research.
 If successful, this REC will have a large and sustained impact on the field by training new leaders. This
leadership is essential for meeting the expanding needs of the growing ADRD research work force. The
innovative OSCAR ADRC core leader training program can become a model for research education and
leadership training across the ADC network."
10784393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One hallmark of cancer is a tumor’s ability to evade immune detection and elimination. Immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) are an attractive therapeutic strategy for many cancers. After many clinical trials targeting various
solid cancer types, however, only 15-40% of patients benefited from ICI therapy. Shockingly, 4-29% of non-
responsive patients developed hyperprogressive disease (HPD), a condition characterized by accelerated tumor
growth and rapid clinical deterioration. Very little is known about what causes HPD or how to prevent it, but
recent work suggests that tumor hyperproliferation is an immune-related adverse event (irAE). As part of the
VAI-SU2C Epigenetic Dream Team, we discovered that activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway
and its downstream target gene CYP1A1 are prognostic indicators for the hyperproliferative-irAE (HP-irAE), and
that HP-irAE bladder tumors show a metabolic switch towards fatty acid and xenobiotic metabolism. AHR is
known to have an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis and immune dysfunction, which leads to the working
hypothesis that AHR activation before ICI therapy preconditions the cancer cells or tumor microenvironment for
rapid proliferation, where HP-irAE is then triggered by intracellular PD-L1 signaling in immune cells and/or cancer
cells after ICI therapy. To test this hypothesis, we will first use the NanoString GeoMX platform to spatially profile
RNA and protein expression in CYP1A1-positive bladder tumor microenvironments to resolve the spatial
heterogeneity of immune and cancer cell dependencies (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine how ICI treatment
and AHR activation transcriptionally and metabolically reprograms bladder cancer and immune cells. These
experiments will separate the cancer-intrinsic, immune-related, and metabolic consequence of AHR and PD-L1
signaling, and provide powerful models for future genetic- or drug-screening studies. Finally (Aim 3), we will use
a bladder cancer mouse models to define how AHR and ICI treatment impacts the evolution of the tumor
microenvironment in vivo. These data will provide valuable insight into how AHR activation might influence ICI
efficacy and adverse events. The K99 phase of this project will provide vital training in spatial
transcript/proteomics, metabolomics, and multimodal single-cell technologies, and how to process and integrate
high-dimensional data to understand (bladder) cancer evolution and irAEs. This effort will be guided by an
outstanding, multidisciplinary advisory committee, led by Dr. Peter Jones at Van Andel Institute, that amalgamate
basic and translational science across cancer biology, immunology, epigenetic, and metabolism fields. These
training and new skill sets will be leveraged to ultimately transition into an independent research career (R00
phase) and validate in vitro findings with in vivo mouse models. Together, this project will provide the first
mechanistic insights into how the AHR pathway exacerbates bladder cancer response to ICI treatment, which
will provide new opportunities for future drug discovery and precision medicine efforts to minimize HP-irAE in
ICI-treated patients."
10784394,"Project Summary
The ability to perceive and respond to vocalizations across behavioral contexts is key for survival, but the
mechanisms for how the brain derives meaning from acoustic features to drive appropriate behavioral responses
remain unknown. I will test the overall hypothesis that top-down control of feed-forward auditory circuits via
cortical projection neurons is critical for recognition of social calls and routing of sensory information to circuits
driving behavior. In the mentored (K99) phase, I will take advantage of an ethological mouse behavior studied
extensively in my postdoctoral lab, in which parentally-experienced mice search for lost pups in response to a
specific type of vocalization. Experienced moms are experts at this behavior, but it can also be learned by virgins,
and learning is correlated with plasticity in the left auditory cortex in females. Pup retrieval involves a complex
sequence of actions, and auditory cues may be required during specific epochs. I will build upon my pilot data
finding that cortical projection neurons are necessary for retrieval, and that exposure to pup calls drives sustained
activity in a distinct projection in experienced females. Aim 1 (K99) uses imaging and multi-area ensemble
recordings to ask how inter-area dynamics in recurrent auditory circuits change during pup calls compared to
non-vocal sounds with similar temporal structures, with the hypothesis that network activity is elevated
specifically during vocalizations to facilitate brain state modulation or communication with sensorimotor circuits
over time scales relevant for behavior. Synaptic mechanisms driving this persistent activity will be examined with
in vivo whole-cell recordings. Aim 2 (K99) will test which projection neurons are required for retrieval and over
what behavioral time scales. Animals vocalize in multiple situations to communicate distinct meanings – for
example, male calls to communicate aggression or courtship – and the brain must make sense of these calls,
using acoustic features as well as non-auditory context cues to distinguish between meanings. In the
independent phase (R00), Aim 3 asks whether calls are processed with neural ensembles and inter-area
dynamics that are generalized across categories or distinct for specific behavioral outcomes. Additionally, the
relevance of different social calls can change depending on an animal’s internal state. Aim 4 (R00) investigates
whether neural ensemble representations of male calls change in female mice as sexual receptivity varies,
measuring activity in cortical ensembles tracked over weeks of experience. In the mentored phase I will complete
a training plan designed to strengthen the experimental and computational skills needed for my research
program as an independent investigator, and to build the professional skills needed for success as a faculty
member, taking advantage of resources and expertise available from the mentor, advisory committee and
broader environment at NYU."
10788273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Aminoglycosides are one of the cheapest and well-known antibiotics in clinical use for over 70 years, but
one of the major limitations in their use is their ototoxicity. We are developing fast and low-cost methods to
develop aminoglycosides with anti-ribosomal activities and reduced toxicity. In this project, we will identify novel
aminoglycoside antibacterials, that show reduced ototoxicity. Complexes between ribosomal components will be
exploited as targets for small molecule drug libraries that- inactivate the ribosome, stopping bacterial protein
synthesis and causing bacterial death while reducing toxicity. This work addresses an important health issue,
antibiotic ototoxicity, and presents creative steps towards a novel solution to this problem.
 Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to 2-3 classes), extensive drug resistance (XDR,
resistance to most classes except colistin or tigecycline) and even pan drug resistance (PDR, resistance to all
classes) nosocomial bacterial infections have skyrocketed in recent years, and the emergence of pan drug-
resistant isolates are making these infections increasingly difficult to treat. Hospital-acquired infections like these
account for up to 4% of all hospital stays in the United States and are incredibly diverse in causative pathogen,
antibiotic resistance profile, and severity. A significant cause of nosocomial infection is the Enterobacteriaceae
family, which includes Gram-negative bacilli that can be commensal or pathogenic. Enterobacteriaceae have a
widespread clinical and economic impact due to the diversity of infections they cause; this family causes many
infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and intra-abdominal
infections (IAIs). The World Health Organization (WHO) lists carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
as having a critical need for novel antibiotics on their Priority Pathogens list. Because the mortality of these multi
drug-resistant infections is between 30 and 50% and there is such difficulty in finding viable treatments, the need
for novel therapeutics for these pathogens must be addressed.
 Unless innovative strategies are developed to produce robust and effective new classes of antibiotics,
health care costs will continue to climb and we will completely lose our ability to combat even the most common
infection. Influenza and coronavirus (SARS and COVID-19) create an even more urgent need for targeting
resistant bacteria related to lung infections, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a common
example of CRE being Klebsiella Pneumoniae (KP). A recent article by J. Gerberding, former CDC director
states, “The patients at greatest risk from superbugs like CRE, CR-A. buamanii and CR-P. aeruginosa and other
bacterial pathogens that can cause lung diseases, are the ones who are already more vulnerable to illness from
viral lung infections like influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. The 2009 H1N1
influenza pandemic, for example, claimed nearly 300,000 lives around the world. Many of those deaths —
between 29% and 55% — were actually caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia, according to the CDC.” A
recent study (Zhou,
Lancet 2020, 395, 1054-1062) from Wuhan reports that almost 50% of COVID-19 related
deaths showed evidence of secondary bacterial infections (pneumonia, sepsis, bloodstream infections). Clearly,
more work needs to be done to better understand the role of secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 related
morbidities, and develop non-toxic interventions in parallel.
 One of the challenges of research in infectious diseases is to find ways to use the increasing knowledge
of the mechanisms underlying disease biology, transformation and progression to develop novel therapeutic
strategies for MDR, XDR, and PDR bacterial infections. Targeting heavily conserved RNA structures, present in
the 4 billion years old bacterial ribosome, and involved in proliferation and survival of bacteria, is a promising
approach. RNA, the essential nucleic acid component of the ribosome, is a validated target for drug design, both
as therapeutic and as a target. The work proposed here, a multidisciplinary effort using rapid methods of
synthesis, bacterial inhibition and zebrafish screening assays in Phase I studies, will be further developed in
Phase II using in vivo efficacy and ototoxicity studies using guinea pig models. The success of the proposed
work would be a significant addition to currently available approaches in antibacterial therapy. We propose using
novel aminoglycoside modifications, patented NUBAD assays, and preliminary results from a zebrafish
screening assay and mouse organ culture to identify conjugates that show reduced ototoxicities, opening
possibilities for developing aminoglycosides that can target resistant pathogens with much improved therapeutic
indices."
10788386,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is associated with a poor prognosis and
short survival in spite of aggressive management. T cell dysfunction is a crucial component in the
immunosuppressed state observed in the GBM tumor microenvironment and remains a significant barrier for the
development of successful immunotherapies. Recent work suggests modulation with the immune-checkpoint
inhibitors α-PD-1 or α-CTLA-4 do not provide significant clinical benefit in GBM, as opposed to other cancers.
These data suggest that multiple co-inhibitory receptors are involved in the GBM tumor microenvironment driving
T cell dysfunction. While investigating T cell dysfunction in human inflammatory disease, we first identified a key
role for engagement of TIGIT on T cells by CD155 as a major co-inhibitory pathway; we then demonstrated a
role for TIGIT in maintaining functional stability of Tregs, in that TIGIT signaling prevents conversion of Tregs
into proinflammatory cells. Moreover, we and others have found that TIGIT and its ligand CD155 are highly
expressed in GBM. Our new preliminary data using single-cell RNAseq shows that, among GBM tumor-infiltrating
T cells, Tregs express the highest levels of TIGIT. Anti-TIGIT therapies are now entering clinical trials in cancer
and recently, α-TIGIT mAb tiragolumab was given FDA breakthrough designation. In this proposal, we will
elucidated mechanisms of T cell dysfuction in GBM by conducting a phase 0/1 clinical trial of α-TIGIT and α-PD-
1 mAbs as checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of recurrent GBM. The trial design allows for establishing the safety
of this combination, while providing tumor samples and blood specimens for a robust evaluation of in human
effects of α-TIGIT & α-PD-1 either alone or in combination, with transcriptomic single-cell resolution. Our
mechanistic hypothesis is that while anti-PD-1 enhances both effector and regulatory T cell proliferation, the
addition of α-TIGIT to α-PD-1 will destabilize Treg function and optimize the immune response. To investigate
this hypothesis, our trial utilizes a “window-of-opportunity” design, within a bench-to-bedside-to-bench approach.
Prior to surgery for resection of recurrent tumor, patients will be randomized to receive placebo, or α-PD-1, or α-
TIGIT either alone or in combination. Single-cell RNAseq (10x) will be performed on baseline blood, post-
treatment blood and tumor specimens from the trial patients. We will compare clonality and functional traits of
tumor-infiltrating Tregs and effector T cells, and frequency of proinflammatory and suppressive tumor-derived
myeloid cells. Multiplexed immunofluorescence (4i) will be used for spatial validation. We will analyze circulating
T cells clonally related to tumor-infiltrating T cells to identify peripheral correlates and develop a non-invasive
biomarker of emerging immune response. We will then model effects of PD-1 and TIGIT blockade on T regs in
vitro using healthy donors T regs and compare to effects observed in the trial. Through this comprehensive
approach, our study will determine whether PD-1 and TIGIT receptor engagement on T cells in the GBM tumor
microenvironment induces immune dysfunction not allowing for immune survelliance in this CNS tumor."

Chronic HIV infection produces pathologic inflammation which drives disease progression and contributes to
the development of serious co-morbid medical conditions, even in the setting of effective combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART); translocation of bacterial products across the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa is a
major antigenic stimulus for this process. Our research focuses on how vagal dysfunction (VD), which occurs
commonly as part of HIV-associated neuropathy, affects GI and immune function in HIV. Our prior work has
shown that HIV+ individuals with VD have a high prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),
and that SIBO is associated with elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which predicts morbidity and
mortality in HIV. We have also demonstrated that treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
pyridostigmine, reduces indirect markers of bacterial translocation (sCD14) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine
TNFα. The current proposal builds on this work, with the overarching goal of examining vagally-mediated GI
mechanisms which could contribute to chronic inflammation in individuals with well-controlled HIV. Specifically
we will seek to establish that small intestinal dysmotility and hypochlorhydria mediate the relationship between
VD and SIBO, and to describe the changes in the GI microbiome in PLWH with SIBO. We will also determine
whether VD is associated with elevations in IL-6 and TNFα independent of SIBO, establish to what degree the
strength of these relationships depend on the presence of HIV infection, and whether they are reversible using
pyridostigmine and/or non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS). To achieve these aims, we will recruit 150
HIV+ participants who will undergo autonomic function tests for VD, hydrogen methane breath testing for
SIBO, Wireless Motility Capsule (WMC, Smartpill) testing for GI regional transit times and pH measurements,
oral and stool sample collection for characterization of the GI microbiome, and blood draw for quantification of
inflammatory biomarkers. HIV-negative controls (N=100) will undergo the same assessments. Then a subset
of 96 HIV+ participants will enter one of two eight-week interventional phases followed by repetition of the
same testing battery: 1) double-blind treatment with pyridostigmine vs. placebo (N=86), or 2) open label
treatment with non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (N=10). These procedures will shed light on mechanisms
linking VD to immune dysregulation in HIV, and provide support for potential therapies."
10788436,"Summary
The goal of this proposal is to understand how transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) family
signaling regulates the formation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the embryo. All HSCs in
the adult bone marrow are descendants of pre-hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs) that
differentiate from hemogenic endothelial (HE) cells in the major caudal arteries of the embryo.
However, only a subset of hematopoietic cells that differentiate from HE cells in the arteries are
pre-HSCs, while many are committed lympho-myeloid biased progenitors. We generated a
comprehensive single cell dataset covering the developmental trajectory of blood cell formation
from HE cells and identified genes specifically expressed in pre-HSCs. We demonstrate that one
of these genes, Smad7, which is a negative regulator of TGFb family signaling, is required for the
formation of multi-lineage adult-repopulating HSCs in the embryo but is not required for the
generation of lympho-myeloid biased progenitors. The goals of this proposal are to determine at

Infection-specific lipid metabolism as a target to control enterovirus infections
The development of the membranous replication organelles is a crucial step in the life cycle of all positive-strand
RNA viruses of eukaryotes, including enteroviruses. The unique lipid and protein composition of the replication
organelles is essential for the functioning of the viral enzymatic replication machinery, and the membranes likely
hide the replication complexes containing dsRNA from the sensors and effectors of the cellular anti-viral
response. In the case of enteroviruses, the structural and functional development of the replication organelles
requires a profound reconfiguration of the cellular lipid synthesis and membrane metabolism pathways. Recently
we and others demonstrated that diverse enteroviruses universally engage lipid droplets, dynamic cellular
organelles that regulate the lipid metabolism, to support the development of the replication organelles.
The emerging picture shows that enterovirus infection results in: 1) activation of lipolysis of neutral lipids stored
in lipid droplets, liberating free long-chain fatty acids; 2) activation of long chain-acyl-CoA synthetases whose
activity is necessary to re-route the long-chain fatty acids into metabolic processes in the form of acyl-CoAs, and
3) redirection of the newly-synthesized acyl-CoAs into the synthesis of structural phospholipids, providing
membranes for the expansion of the replication organelles. We hypothesize that the influx of free long-chain fatty
acids triggers the subsequent changes in the lipid metabolism of infected cells. Our data also demonstrate that
by targeting different pathways of lipid metabolism it is possible to make the replication more sensitive to the
innate immunity mechanisms, or to specifically eliminate the infected cells, providing a new perspective on the
control of enterovirus infections.
Here, we formed a team of experts in virology and lipid research to use biochemical, cell biology, innovative
microscopy and proteomics methods to investigate the changes in lipid metabolism in enterovirus-infected cells.
We will focus on the activation of lipid droplet lipolysis and engagement of acyl-CoA synthetases because they
define the landscape of lipid metabolism in infected cells. We will also investigate the role of the structural
expansion of the replication organelles in the protection of the replication complexes and explore the
vulnerabilities of infected cells conferred by the reconfiguration of the lipid synthesis pathways. We will use
enteric and respiratory airway epithelia ex-vivo systems to study the role of rewiring lipid metabolism in relevant
cells upon infection of diverse enteroviruses. We believe that this project will significantly advance the
fundamental knowledge of lipid metabolism in infected cells, broadly relevant for virology and cell biology, and
will open new perspectives for the development of interventions effective against diverse enteroviruses."

Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) accounted for 79% of new HIV infections among youth ages
13-19 in the United States (US) in 2018. Less than a quarter of AMSM have ever taken an HIV test. Despite
these stark disparities in HIV incidence and testing, interventions to reduce sexual risk and increase HIV
testing among AMSM remain extremely limited. Notably, the very few intervention approaches that are
currently being explored for AMSM exclude parents. The omission of parent-focused approaches represents a
glaring gap in national efforts to end the HIV epidemic given parents’ well-documented ability to shape
adolescent sexual health, including for AMSM. Consistent with NIH priorities (PA-20-144) the goal of the
proposed research is to test the efficacy of a parent-focused intervention designed to reduce HIV risk and
increase HIV testing among AMSM. Parents and Adolescents Talking about Healthy Sexuality (PATHS) is an
online intervention we created for parents of AMSM that works to increase parent communication about sexuality
and HIV, as well as other parent behaviors supportive of sexual risk reduction. Our NIH-funded pilot RCT with a
national sample of 61 racially/ethnically diverse parent-AMSM dyads revealed that PATHS increased both
parent and child reports of multiple parent behaviors supportive of sexual health. Building on the promising
effects PATHS had on parent behaviors, the goal of the proposed study is to test whether PATHS improves
sexual health outcomes in AMSM ages 14-19. We will conduct an RCT of PATHS with 350 parent-AMSM
dyads recruited online (50% racial/ethnic minority). Parents will be randomized to receive either PATHS or an
active control, and then assessed every 3 months over a 1-year period. Primary outcomes will be evaluated at
6 months post-intervention, and then the control arm will crossover and receive PATHS, and dyads will be
followed for another 6 months. This allows us to further test the effects of PATHS in the control arm while
simultaneously modeling the longer 9- and 12-month effects in the original intervention arm. The primary (P)
specific aims are to: (P1) Test the efficacy of PATHS in improving the degree to which AMSM are prepared for
intercourse (operationalized as: having access to condoms, demonstrating accurate condom skills, expressing
intentions to use condoms, receiving HIV testing, understanding what PrEP is, and expressing positive
attitudes toward PrEP); and (P2) Test the efficacy of PATHS in reducing condomless anal/vaginal intercourse.
Secondary (S) aims are to: (S1) Examine the degree to which intervention effects observed in P1 and P2
persist to 1-year post intervention; and (S2) Examine how parent behaviors mediate effects of PATHS on
AMSM outcomes. If proven efficacious, PATHS will be among the first interventions demonstrated to reduce
sexual risks and increase HIV testing for AMSM – the population of youth at highest risk for HIV infection in the
US. Moreover, as other adolescent-focused interventions emerge, PATHS’ unique focus on parents will offer a
complementary, additional means for reaching AMSM who are not touched by other intervention options."

The accurate segregation of chromosomes by the microtubule-based mitotic spindle during mitosis is
essential for the preservation of genomic integrity. Errors in mitotic spindle function lead to chromosome
missegregation, aneuploidy, and the formation of micronuclei, all hallmarks of tumor cells. Molecular motors
of the kinesin superfamily play important mechanical roles in controlling the movement and organization of
chromosomes within the spindle, including the generation of forces on chromosome arms, regulation of
spindle microtubule length changes, and the crosslinking and sliding of microtubule overlaps. Many of the
molecular mechanisms underlying kinesin function in cells remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks
to fill knowledge gaps in our understanding of how kinesins function at the molecular level to ensure the
accuracy of mitotic chromosome segregation. How do the structures of kinesins tune their activities for
particular roles in cells? How are these activities spatially and temporally regulated? What is the molecular
basis for cell type specific requirements of kinesin function? What are the short and long-term
consequences of abnormal kinesin activities? An interdisciplinary approach combining biophysics,
quantitative live cell imaging, and structural mutagenesis will be employed to address these outstanding
questions across biological scales from the single molecule to single cell, to tissue and whole organism
levels."
10759464,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare lung disease characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular
obliteration resulting in right ventricular failure and ultimately death. Throughout the last three decades there
has been tremendous progress in understanding disease mechanisms that have led to new therapies, however
survival remains poor at approximately 8 years after diagnosis for most patients. There have been several
recent NIH/NHLBI sponsored workshops on phenotyping patients with PAH and moving accumulating “Omic”
data into the clinic to advance precision medicine in PAH, yet there are few centers in where this work is
ongoing and training the next generation of researchers in these techniques will be critically important to
advancing the field of PAH therapy and pulmonary vascular disease more broadly. Dr. Hemnes is a well-
recognized expert in this field and her objective is to use the support of the K24 Midcareer Investigator Award
in Patient-Oriented Research to focus on training the next generation of scientists to bring precision medicine
approaches to PAH patient therapy. The candidate’s immediate and long-term career objectives are directly in
line with the goals of the NIH K24 award, to provide support for protected time for awardees to devote to
patient-oriented research and culturally-sensitive mentoring for students, residents, fellows and junior faculty.
Specifically, this award will allow her to focus on the development of (1) a patient-oriented research program in
pulmonary vascular disease research and (2) a mentoring program to facilitate the career development of new
investigators. This award will provide protected time for the candidate to devote specifically to developing
mentoring skills in patient-oriented research. Her objective is to recruit and mentor students, residents, fellows
and junior faculty for successful clinical research careers in pulmonary vascular disease and to support the
career advancement of her current trainees who are fellows and junior faculty members. To expand her
patient-oriented research program in PAH, she will combine two lines of study in her research portfolio (1)
understanding how insulin resistance in the lipid axis may predispose to PAH or affect outcomes and (2) using
Omic techniques to deep phenotype patients with pulmonary vascular disease. The proposal here will build on
her funded work to test the hypothesis that Omic signatures in PAH can identify features of resilience to PAH
progression and metabolic intervention susceptibility. The specific aims are (1) To compare PAH patients with
and without Omic signatures of metabolic dysfunction, define differences in clinical and molecular features and
measure relevant outcomes between the two groups, (2) To test and validate Omic predictors of metformin
responses in completed and ongoing clinical trials in PAH patients. Completion of these aims will enhance
understanding of the pathogenesis of PAH and uncover potentially improved treatment strategies of metabolic
disease in PAH specifically. The proposed new research, along with the candidate’s other funded research
projects, will provide invaluable training opportunities in patient-oriented pulmonary vascular disease research."
10759465,"SUMMARY
Cellular morphology is one of the most distinctive features of somatic cells in multicellular organisms and is
intimately linked with cellular function. How neurons and other polarized cells commit to their morphologies is
poorly understood, but spontaneous morphogenesis of dissociated cells in culture suggest that the basic
instructions for morphology are often intrinsically encoded. We previously identified a sequence-specific RNA-
binding protein, Unkempt, as a factor that is essential for the establishment of the early neuronal morphology
and as a protein that is capable of endowing a similar shape to cells of nonneuronal origin. Unkempt
recognizes a unique binding motif predominantly within coding regions mRNAs the translation of which it
suppresses. It is unclear how Unkempt regulates translation, and whether translation or another functional
modality of Unkempt is critical to its induction of cell polarization. Here, we seek to solve this problem by
deciphering the mechanistic basis of Unkempt-driven remodeling of cellular shape. Our preliminary studies
indicate that in the broad protein-protein interaction network of Unkempt, the interaction between Unkempt’s
low-complexity domain (LCD) and the CCR4-NOT complex is exquisitely required for the induction of cell
morphogenesis. We propose three specific aims to investigate the molecular and cellular roles of the CCR4-
NOT complex as a critical effector of Unkempt-controlled cell morphogenesis. First, we will investigate the
nature of Unkempt – CCR4-NOT interactions and their impact on the fate of the targeted messages, focusing
in particular on their poly(A) tail length, stability, and translation. Second, we will interrogate the recruitment
and function of CCR4-NOT in Unkempt-induced cell morphogenesis. Third, we will determine the effect of
post-translational modifications of Unkempt on its interactions with the CCR4-NOT complex and RNA, as well
as its control of local protein translation. This study will shed light on the molecular underpinnings of the early
neuronal morphogenesis and contribute to our general understanding of the cues that control cellular
morphology in development and disease."
10759466,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Optic nerve demyelinating diseases such as Optic Neuritis (ON) cause acute reduction of visual acuity and often
chronic visual loss. The estimated incidence of ON in the USA is 6.4/100,000, and 50% of the 2.5 million multiple
sclerosis (MS) patients worldwide are estimated to develop one or more episodes of ON during the course of
their disease. Myelination of the optic nerve is carried out by a specialized cell, the oligodendrocyte (OL), that
coats and protects axons and promotes neural conduction. Demyelination can cause apoptosis of the OLs,
axonal damage, and neuronal cell death. Remyelination-based treatments have the potential to help protect
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and reduce chronic vision loss, and perhaps help restore lost vision. The
long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular pathways involved in differentiation and maturation of OLs
that can be exploited for promoting remyelination of the demyelinated optic nerve. To this end, the PI has
developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporters for RGCs and OLs, and performed single cell RNA-
sequencing and a preliminary high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify regulators of OL differentiation and
maturation. Based upon this preliminary data, the PI proposes to: 1) expand the screening effort to identify
additional compounds and pathways involved in OL maturation, 2) examine the transcription factors and
pathways identified from the preliminary work for their role in OL differentiation, and 3) further identify and
systemically characterize microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in OL specification and maturation. To perform the
proposed studies, the PI will develop innovative tools such as hPSC-reporters for OL differentiation with inducible
CRISPRi (interference) and CRISPRa (activation) system, and a functional in-vitro hOL/hRGC co-culture system
for assessing hRGC myelination by hOLs. In the mentored phase, in Dr. Don Zack’s lab, the PI will carry out
genome-editing to generate the CRISPRi and CRISPRa lines and acquire training at Wilmer’s HCS facility where
small molecule screening to probe for signaling pathways involved in OL maturation will be performed. In the
second year, under the guidance of Dr. Jay Baraban (an expert in microRNA biology), the miRNA studies on
OLs will be initiated. The mentored phase will also be supplemented by training with Ingo Ruczinski (biostatistics
collaborator), who will provide assistance with the pathway analysis and hit validation of HTS. Furthermore, the
PI’s co-mentor, Dr. Peter Calabresi, who is a leading scientist in demyelinating diseases, will regularly meet,
advise and help him prioritize the genes and pathways for further examination. Additionally, during the mentored
phase, the PI will regularly meet with his advisory committee, attend scientific conferences, and continue his
career development. The PI is in an ideal environment for the proposed research and for his career development
as Dr. Zack has an established hPSC lab, state-of-the-art HCS facilities, and collaborations with renowned
neuroscientists and vision-scientists. This will help PI to set-up good collaborations, learn new techniques, and
build an independent research laboratory at a well-established academic institution."
10758968,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 40 million people world-wide are infected with HIV, an infection for which there is no cure. Many strategies
that aim to cure HIV focus on harnessing HIV-specific T cells to control the virus that rebounds after antiretroviral
therapy (ART) is discontinued because of their ability to specifically recognize and kill HIV-infected cells.
However, HIV-specific T cell therapies will not be effective if they cannot overcome the T cell exhaustion that
occurs in the setting of chronic antigen stimulation. In mouse models of chronic infection and cancer, T cells
enriched for a stem cell memory (TSCM) phenotype or stem-like transcriptional program robustly expand and
differentiate into effector cells while resisting exhaustion. We have found that the expression of the
stem/memory-promoting transcription factor, TCF-1, is associated with high in vitro proliferative capacity in HIV-
specific CD8+ T cells in individuals who naturally control HIV infection and that TCF-1 overexpression leads to
better HIV-specific T cell expansion after in vitro peptide stimulation. While T cells that are enriched for stemness
programs proliferate and control cancer better in animal models, it is currently unknown whether stem-like T cells
(versus, for example, effector-differentiated T cells) are optimal for controlling HIV after ART is stopped. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to directly establish the role of T cell stemness in promoting the ability of HIV-
specific T cells to expand a functional effector population to control HIV infection after discontinuation of ART. In
Aim 1, we will use multi-modal high-dimensional single cell phenotypic and transcriptional profiling to establish
whether the proportion of stem-like virus-specific CD8+ T cells on ART correlates with their in vivo expansion
and subsequent control of HIV in humans or SIV in macaques after treatment interruption. In Aim 2, we will use
envelope (Env)-targeting HIV-specific CAR-T cells with potent anti-HIV activity (duoCAR-T cells) as a model to
ask how precisely tuning the level of stemness influences the ability of CAR-T cells to suppress HIV long-term
in the HIV Participant-Derived Xenograft (PDX) mouse model. In Aim 3, we will leverage blood and tissue
samples from a highly unique clinical trial of people with HIV on ART who receive an infusion of anti-HIV duoCAR-
T cells and undergo an ATI. We hypothesize that CAR-T cells that are more stem-like prior to infusion (i.e., either
the CAR-T cells in the total pre-infusion product or sub-populations that we identify pre-infusion and then track
in vivo post-infusion using single cell paired α/β TCR sequences as “barcodes”) will expand a larger, less-
exhausted effector population. These studies will test for the first time in the context of HIV infection the
compelling hypothesis that T cells enriched for stemness have greater proliferative capacity and durability and
are able to give rise to effector T cells that are better able to control HIV in vivo. We will also comprehensively
evaluate other T cell differentiation states that might associate with HIV control after ART discontinuation.
Completion of these studies will result in new knowledge about the role of HIV-specific T cell differentiation states
in the development of effective T cell-based strategies for HIV cure."

Although exposure and response prevention (ERP) is well-established as the first line of treatment for obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), 40-50% of patients who receive this intervention do not recover. Novel
augmentations are needed to more efficiently target the mechanisms that maintain OCD symptoms in this
population. One candidate mechanism is interpretation bias, the misinterpretation of ambiguous stimuli as
threatening, contributing to the development and maintenance of OCD. In the absence of interventions that more
efficiently and effectively target interpretation bias, it will likely remain difficult to increase rates of treatment
response and decrease relapse. The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, adherence,
target engagement, and clinical outcomes of an intervention targeting interpretation bias, with the ultimate goal
of contributing to the development of novel, scalable, technology-driven augmentations to ERP. Improvements
in interpretation bias have been associated with OC symptom reduction. Therefore, an accessible intervention
which directly targets interpretation bias may be an ideal augmentation to improve clinical outcomes during ERP.
Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation Bias (CBM-I), a computerized intervention, has shown reliable
effects for engagement of interpretation. Studies of CBM-I in OCD have been largely conducted in analogue
samples, and studies with clinical samples have been limited. This proposal will address the critical need of
developing interventions to augment ERP by utilizing CBM-I, with primary aims to: 1) test whether CBM-I induces
changes in interpretation bias in OCD and to determine if these changes are associated with clinical outcomes
across multi-modal assessments, and 2) leverage advances in machine learning to develop personalized
predictions of which individuals with OCD are best-suited for CBM-I. We hypothesize that a multivariate model
incorporating pre-treatment clinical, behavioral and demographic characteristics will predict patient-specific
probability of responding to CBM-I. These aims map onto the candidate’s training goals, with critical new training
and mentorship provided in the areas of: 1) effectiveness trials methodology with an experimental therapeutics
approach (Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Courtney Beard; Co-Mentor Dr. Sabine Wilhelm); 2) ecological momentary
assessment (Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Christian Webb and Dr. Beard; Collaborator Dr. Justin Baker); 3) machine
learning techniques (Dr. Webb and Collaborator Dr. Boyu Ren); and 4) career development (Co-Mentor Dr. Kerry
Ressler). This K23 Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research and provide the
candidate with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the
understanding, prediction, and treatment of non-response and relapse, to optimize outcomes of exposure
therapy for refractory patients with OC-related disorders."
10760292,"Abstract: Current self-tests for HIV rely on detection of antibodies to the virus, and thus are not
useful during the early stages of infection. These assays are also not appropriate for patients on
antiretroviral therapy who may be at risk for viral rebound, as pre-existing anti-HIV antibodies
mask changes in viral load. Conversely, current HIV diagnostics based on detection of viral RNA
are sensitive, but too complex and expensive to be appropriate for self-testing. To address this
critical need, we will develop the first enzyme-free sample-to-answer HIV viral load self-test, in
which a fingerstick volume of blood is passively processed leading to amplification of the isolated
HIV genomic RNA. The RNA amplification strategy will rely on hairpin cascade reactions (HCR),
a DNA nanotechnology approach with proven single-copy sensitivity in other contexts, in a sessile
droplet implementation. The entire assay will be implemented in an inexpensive, disposable,
paper-based consumable. In the R61 phase, we propose to: (1) building on methods we have
previously validated, optimize passive processing of whole blood coupled with paper-based viral
lysis and RNA isolation; (2) complete development of HCR-based amplification of HIV genomic
RNA; (3) integrate sample processing and RNA amplification into a single consumable; and (4)
obtain feedback on assay design and usability from patients at risk for HIV infection, and develop
a pilot manufacturing plan. In the R33 phase, we will (1) scale production of the assay with
contract manufacturers in quantities suitable for pilot testing, and (2) complete testing of the assay
with a cohort of 1000 patients at-risk for HIV infection, recruited from patients visiting the
Emergency Department at the University of Rochester Medical Center."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most devastating cancers with poor prognosis
and rising incidence. To combat this deadly disease, we should direct our efforts towards preventing PDAC or
halting the progression of precursor lesions to invasive disease parallel to developing novel treatments. One of
the earliest known initiating events for PDAC is the process of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM).
Understanding and reduction of ADM formation may reduce early PDAC development and progression. Blacks
display a significantly increased incidence and mortality from PDAC compared to other races for unknown
reasons. The role of race on pancreatic ADM and its contributions to the development and progression of
PDAC need to be addressed. In our previous studies, we used normal pancreatic acinar tissues from Black,
White and Hispanic donors to study the impact of race on acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and found that
Blacks undergo ADM to a greater extent than Whites or Hispanics. In this competitive renewal, we will expand
on and extend our previous study by including diseased tissues from CP and PDAC from White, Black, and
Hispanic donors since accumulating evidence suggest that chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a major precursor to the
development of PDAC. We will investigate the impact of race on the cellular and molecular events regulating
the interplay between ADM and the microenvironment. Guided by our published and unpublished results, we
hypothesize that the racial disparities seen in PDAC are related to differences in how the pancreas
microenvironment develops during ADM, which means that ADM and its surrounding microenvironment can be
used as a target to treat PDAC. We propose the following specific aims to address this hypothesis: Aim 1: The
impact of race on ADM from the healthy pancreas, CP, and PDAC tissues. Aim 2: The roles of pancreatic
stellate cells and macrophages in ADM and ADM reversal. Aim 3: Contributions of the race to ADM reversal
and cell heterogeneity. The proposed studies will impact the field of pancreatic cancer by providing a missing
link between disparities, ADM, tumor microenvironment, and potential treatments for CP and PDAC. The
specific focus on the racial contributions of microenvironment remolding during pancreatic metaplasia aligns

10761765,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease with a high mortality rate. In
most cases, PAH-induced chronic pressure overload leads to right ventricle (RV) failure. Right heart
catheterization (RHC) is currently the gold standard test for PAH diagnosis and follow-up. Furthermore, repeated
RHC should be considered in patients who experience unexplained clinical deterioration during their clinical
course or for periodic follow-up over time. Yet many centers across the world do not routinely perform RHC
during follow-up, for a variety of potential reasons, including its invasive nature, cost, or availability.
We have recently developed 3D echocardiographic particle image velocimetry (Echo-PIV), which allows high-
temporal volumetric assessment of RV hemodynamics. In combination with standard 3D speckle tracking, 3D
Echo-PIV enables a comprehensive assessment of hemodynamics and energy state (ventricular kinetic
energy/work and viscous energy dissipation) in the RV. The RV energy state reflects the structural and functional
changes in the RV that may occur due to PAH. Thus, it can be used as a load-independent measure to assess
RV function and monitor disease progression/regression in PAH patients.
The project's global hypothesis is that in PAH patients' follow-up, changes in the RV energy state: (1) reflect
changes in RHC-derived pulmonary arterial pressures, and (2) are associated with changes in patients' clinical
status such that it can be used to monitor disease progression and regression.
Given that in more advanced disease, RV dysfunction is present, we will gather a prospective, ethnically diverse
cohort of 210 subjects at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center: 70 PAH patients with normal RV function, 70 PAH
patients with RV dysfunction, and 70 healthy control subjects. The following Specific Aims will be accomplished:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Investigate the accuracy of 3D Echo-PIV in characterizing 4D flow hemodynamics in the RV
using 4D Flow CMR as a reference standard and assess test/retest reproducibility of 3D Echo-PIV in PAH.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine the relationship between the noninvasively derived RV energy state and RHC-
derived parameters in following up PAH patients and test whether changes in the RV energy state reflect
changes in the RHC-derived pulmonary arterial pressures in PAH patients with and without RV dysfunction.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Investigate the feasibility of noninvasive imaging-derived RV energy state for monitoring
disease progression/regression in PAH patients.
The success of the proposed studies will establish 3D Echo-PIV as a tool for assessment of PAH patients and
will: (1) determine the relationship between noninvasive RV imaging and invasive RHC-based hemodynamics,
(2) establish whether changes in noninvasive RV energy state reflect changes in the RHC-derived parameters
in PAH patients, and (3) facilitate monitoring of disease progression/regression by noninvasive RV energy state
in lieu of invasive RHC (current clinical gold standard)."
10888388,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the practice of “boarding” patients admitted to the hospital in the
Emergency Department (ED) has reached unprecedented levels. For critically ill patients including those with
acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), ED boarding worsens outcomes as patients spend hours in the ED
waiting to be transferred to the appropriate inpatient ward for specialized care. Given the unabated increase in
ED boarding, length of ED stay, and subsequent time to specialist evaluation and management, developing new
technologies to enable rapid reassessment of ADHF patients during these protracted ED stays is critical for
improved care and patient outcomes. In a typical workflow in the Emergency Department, physicians perform
bedside lung ultrasound once, at time of initial patient presentation, and use the presence or absence of ‘B-
Lines’ in the images as a biomarker for pulmonary congestion. Often assessed by ED physicians in a binary
manner, the presence of B-lines is used in conjunction with a clinical exam and blood tests to rule in acute ADHF.
While detecting B-lines can be as easy as looking at two lung zones to make a clinical decision of ADHF, counting
B-lines requires both skill and training in B-line identification, and in aggregating B-line counts over 8+ lung
zones for accuracy. For a busy ED physician this is prohibitive given constraints on time, training, and cognitive
load. To ease this problem, ED physicians need tools that can automatically count and aggregate the B-lines to
quantify the severity of the congestion. Without this automation, it is entirely possible that either suboptimal or
even no treatment will be initiated for ADHF patients in the ED leading to increased hospital length of stay, further
perpetuating the ED boarding. The creation of tools for automatic quantification has the potential to enable
workflows with reassessment to meet the changing patient care needs. Our long-term goals are to develop
computational tools that mitigate the operator-dependence endemic to ultrasound image acquisition and
interpretation. The objective of this Trailblazer R21 application is to develop and validate computational methods
for quantifying pulmonary congestion from bedside lung ultrasound in the ED, which will be achieved by (1)
developing and evaluating explainable tools for automated quantification of pulmonary congestion using
retrospective lung ultrasound data and (2) validating the performance of the trained models in a workflow
demonstrated by a prospective observational study in which patients presenting to the ED with ADHF will be
assessed with lung ultrasound both pre-and post-therapeutic intervention, and findings typically used to measure
pulmonary congestion on inpatient services will be recorded for both time points."
10914894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An antithrombotic medication not associated with increased hemorrhage would be a transformative advance in
the treatment of coagulation disorders. Inhibiting coagulation factor XII (FXII) has emerged as a therapeutic
strategy that could “decouple” hemostasis from thrombosis to achieve antithrombotic efficacy without bleeding
complications. Enthusiasm for FXII as a therapeutic target stems from the observation that severe congenital
FXII deficiency is not associated with a bleeding diathesis while blockade or deletion of FXII in preclinical models
consistently protects against thrombosis. However, despite its potential clinical importance, the mechanisms
underlying platelet-dependent FXII activation in vivo remain unclear. Using a mass spectrometry-based
proteomic screen, we have identified integrin αIIbβ3 as the putative platelet receptor for FXII. These results have
been followed up with a number of additional studies reproducibly demonstrating the FXII-αIIbβ3 interaction and
localizing the integrin binding region to the kringle domain (KD) of the FXII heavy chain. Our central hypothesis
is that binding of FXII zymogen to platelet integrin αIIbβ3 potentiates FXII activation and is necessary and sufficient
for FXII-mediated coagulation. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will map the region(s) of the FXII KD responsible
for binding to αIIbβ3 via competitive inhibition assays using recombinantly-generated fragments of the KD. We
will also evaluate the role of the FXII KD in a mouse model of thrombosis to determine if loss of the KD can
prevent thrombus formation in vivo. In Aim 2, we will work closely with our collaborators to conduct precision
structural studies of the FXII-αIIbβ3 complex. In Aim 3, we will focus on the mechanisms by which FXII binding
to αIIbβ3 leads to activation of FXII and downstream coagulation. The proposed work will provide important new
insights into the molecular mechanism of FXII recruitment, activation, and propagation at the platelet surface
and inform efforts to develop novel therapeutics based on inhibition of the FXII-αIIbβ3 complex."

A fundamental objective in membrane biology is to understand and predict how protein sequences fold and orient

of MPs. Using a combined molecular genetic and biochemical approach, we established that lipid dependent
TMD orientation is dynamic (i.e., can reversibly change) during and after MP assembly in vivo and is independent
of other cellular factors in vitro. We proposed the Charge Balance Rule, which includes an acitve role for lipid
environment, to explain the dynamic behavior of MPs. We developed a library of lipid mutants of Escherichia coli
in which lipid composition can be regulated during or temporally after MP membrane insertion. The physiological
significance of membrane lipid bilayer asymmetry is an understudied area. We now add to this library a set of E.
coli strains and proteoliposome systems in which membrane lipid bilayer asymmetry can be controlled to
determine the role of lipid bilayer asymmetry in MP dynamic organization. Using this set of lipid reagents and
native or engineered MPs, we propose three integrated Specific Aims: Aim 1, We will quantify in thermodynamic
terms and determine the mechanistic and structural principles underlying the molecular driving forces, as
proposed by the Charge Balance Rule, that govern dynamic TMD topology organization as a function of
membrane lipid composition and asymmetry. Aim 2, The role of CL in cell functions is not well understood. CL
transbilayer asymmetry across any biological membrane is unknown, and there is still no reliable method for
estimating its distribution across any membrane. E. coli lacking CL display several phenotypes under aerobic
and anaerobic conditions, which would seriously compromise growth in the wild. We will address the role of CL,
its transmembrane asymmetry and the three CL synthases in supporting critical cell functions, which will be
applicable to the understanding of the importance of CL and cls gene multiplicity in pathogenic Gram-negative
bacteria. Aim 3, An essential MP (FtsK) was identified by us associated with a late stage of cell division (a defect
in phosphatidylethanolamine-lacking cells) that is topologically responsive to changes in lipid composition and
phosphorylation of its extramembrane domains. We will address how changes in lipid composition/asymmetry
and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles affect the function of FtsK as an example of a physiological
function potentially governed by the Charge Balance Rule. By focusing on interfacial protein-lipid interactions in
lipid bilayers with different lipid compositions and asymmetry, measuring electric forces acting on nascent MPs
during and after assembly, and characterizing physiologically important roles for CL (as we have for
phosphatidylethanolamine), we will enhance our understanding of the forces that define MP structure and
function and the role membrane lipids play in cell processes."

ABSTRACT
Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) has long been the method of choice to study
muscle bioenergetics in humans. 31P-MRS measures relative amounts of phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), and can be used to estimate muscle creatine kinase (CK) kinetics. During exercise, PCr, a
high-energy “reserve” source of ATP, is depleted to meet transient energy demands. The rate of PCr re-synthesis
after exercise is commonly used as a measure of skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity.
Studies using 31P-MRS and multiple other modalities have suggested that abnormal creatine metabolism and
deficient OXPHOS may contribute to the pathophysiology of aging. In addition, it is well established that muscle
groups vary with respect to these metabolic properties, and also in their response to aging. Despite its strengths,
31P-MRS has low anatomic resolution, and does not readily provide muscle group specific estimates of creatine
metabolism. The currently available option for measuring muscle group specific metabolism is invasive biopsy.
Thus, there is a clear unmet need for high-resolution, non-invasive strategies to assess muscle metabolism
simultaneously across heterogeneous muscle groups.
Our group recently introduced a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique known as the Cr-amine
chemical exchange saturation transfer (CrCEST), which measures free Cr formed from PCr utilization. CrCEST
provides over three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to 31P-MRS and can also be used to
investigate CK kinetics and muscle bioenergetics.
In this proposal, we further develop and optimize the CrCEST for use in humans, by improving time resolution,
characterizing reproducibility, and assessing the effects of pH. As a critical part of interrogating the optimized
CrCEST technique, we will test the effects of age, sex, race and physical activity on high-resolution CrCEST in
healthy adults. We expect to demonstrate muscle group specific differences in creatine metabolism and
OXPHOS capacity using non-invasive techniques that were not feasible until now.
Successful accomplishment of this project will i) yield quantitative imaging biomarkers of muscle creatine
metabolism, lactate metabolism and OXPHOS capacity that provide anatomic specificity without the
invasiveness of biopsy-based approaches; ii) provide reference data to support future studies using CrCEST
signal as a non-invasive index of muscle quality in aging and other conditions, including but not limited to
diabetes, muscular dystrophy, peripheral arterial disease, and genetic mitochondrial disorders. We anticipate
that CrCEST (iii) will also serve as a non-invasive muscle group specific monitoring tool to evaluate response to
potential therapies targeting abnormal muscle metabolism in aging, in neuromuscular disorders, and myriad
other conditions. Thus, CrCEST based technologies have the potential to fill a number of important unmet needs
and are expected to exert sustained impact on the field."

Isoniazid-monoresistant (IMR) tuberculosis (TB) comprises 1.1 million (11%) of the estimated 10 million new
TB cases annually. Recent scientific advances for drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) and rifampin-resistant TB (RR-
TB) include reductions in treatment duration from 6 to 4 months for DS-TB and from 18-20 months to 6 months
for RR-TB. In contrast, innovations in care have been modest for IMR-TB, which has a higher worldwide
burden than RR-TB. The current standard of care (SOC) for IMR-TB recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO) is 6 months of rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin (6REZLfx). This
regimen requires pyrazinamide for six months, three times longer than in the SOC for DS-TB; its safety and
tolerability are poorly described; and the evidence underpinning it is derived from an individual patient data
meta-analysis and not from a randomized controlled clinical trial. The proposed R34 NIAID Clinical Trial
Planning Grant will plan an open-label, randomized, controlled Phase 2C clinical trial that will compare the time
to sputum culture conversion in liquid mycobacterial culture (Aim 1), the proportion of Grade 3 or higher
adverse events (Aim 2), and the proportion of relapse-free cure at 12 months (Aim 3) among participants
randomized to one of two novel 4-month intervention regimens compared to the 6-month SOC control for IMR-
TB. For the first intervention arm, we will adapt the S31/A5349 trial’s 4-month isoniazid, rifapentine,
pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin (HPZM) regimen’s proven PZM backbone for IMR-TB with two key
innovations: [1] optimization of rifapentine dosing from 1200 mg daily to 1500 mg daily based on analyses from
the S31/A5349’s pharmacokinetic sub-study, and [2] substitution of clofazimine for isoniazid in HPZM, yielding
a novel CPZM regimen which circumvents isoniazid resistance and may support a 4-month treatment duration
for IMR-TB. For the second intervention arm, we will leverage preclinical and clinical data showing that a novel
rifamycin-free combination of approved drugs, bedaquiline, linezolid, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin (BLZM),
may outperform the TB-PRACTECAL trial’s 6-month bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin
(BPaLM) regimen and permit treatment shortening to 4 months for IMR-TB. The proposed trial fills a critical
and unmet need in IMR-TB drug development by investigating regimens that are congruent with priorities in the
NIAID Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Research and are readily implementable in high TB burden settings. The
trial addresses two research gaps identified by international (WHO) and US-based (ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA)
guidelines development groups, namely [1] the evaluation of new regimens specifically for IMR-TB in
randomized controlled trials and [2] reduction of the duration of pyrazinamide in treatment regimens for IMR-
TB. It also addresses the WHO target regimen profile for IMR-TB: [1] treatment shortening, [2] evaluation of
regimen efficacy with a relapse-free cure endpoint at 12 months, and [3] the potential for a shared indication for
both intervention regimens across IMR-TB and DS-TB, to be elucidated in future Phase 3 studies."

East Trenton, NJ is an environmental justice (EJ) community burdened by lead (Pb). Pb is a cumulative
environmental toxicant that can affect multiple organ systems including the central nervous system. Current
public health guidelines state there is no safe level of Pb exposure. This project’s priority is to reduce Pb
exposure to residents. Partnering with three local community organizations, Isles Inc, East Trenton
Collaborative, and New Jersey Future, community volunteers will conduct citizen science collecting soil
samples from homes throughout the East Trenton neighborhood. Concurrently, Rutgers, ETC, and NJ Future
will host community clinics to offer free blood Pb testing to concerned residents. While no resident will be
turned away, a special emphasis will be placed on collecting blood samples from children. A home visit
(minimum 100 homes) will be conducted in any home that tested above 200 ppm soil Pb (50% EPA residential
soil Pb hazard level) or with a resident’s blood Pb level >0.5µg/dL. Drinking water, paint, soil, and house dust
will be collected and analyzed for Pb isotope ratios and metal-to-metal ratios (e.g., Ti/Pb, Sb/Pb, Ga/Pb, etc.).
Bayesian mixing models will be created using this tracer data to conduct source apportionment that will identify
unique fingerprints for lead sources in blood and house dust. Home specific mitigation strategies will be
developed using data from these mixing models that are specific to the unique sources of lead identified in the
home environment. If a lead paint abatement is required, our community partner (Isles, Inc.) will conduct the
lead paint abatement. Other mitigation strategies, (eg ground cover for exposed soil, entry way dust collecting
mats to trap street dust) will also be recommended and a follow up visit to these 100 homes will be conducted
6 months post-mitigation to test the efficacy of the recommended mitigation strategies. During this visit, blood
and house dust samples will be collected to determine if there was a decrease in exposure. Finally,
dissemination of results will occur through town hall style community presentations and written reports will be
provided to our community partners. This project is valuable because it will develop a playbook that can be
used as an intervention model for other lead burdened communities on developing personalized abatement
strategies available by adding source apportionment to the toolbox for exposure assessment."

Suicide is the fifth leading cause of death among U.S. children 5 to 12 years, yet limited research on childhood
suicide and suicidal behavior (SB) exists. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has acknowledged
this critical gap as a high research priority. A significant risk factor for the early onset of a first suicide attempt
(SA) is a parental history of SB. Although the familial transmission of SB is well documented, research
examining the specific mechanisms associated with familial risk is limited. Our ongoing NIMH-R21 study
(Cohort 1) is investigating factors related to the familial risk of SB in children, 6-9 years, with (PH+; n=100) and
without (PH-; n=100) a parental history of SA. This proposed R01 study will continue annual follow-ups for
Cohort 1 and add an additional 300 newly enrolled families (Cohort 2; ages 9-11 years; 150 per PH group) for
a total sample of 500 parent-child dyads. Youth will be followed for four years from mid/late-childhood through
early/mid-adolescence. Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we will examine the
trajectories of neurocognitive function (NF), emotional reactivity/regulation (ERR), non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), suicidal ideation (SI), and SA in PH+ and PH- youth along with contributions by sex and race. Study
participants at first assessment include youth 7-12 years. At last assessment, youth ages will range from 10-15
years. Both groups, PH+ and PH-, will be balanced by sex and race. Two main research aims and one
exploratory aim will be tested. Aim 1: Examine longitudinally how PH status is associated with trajectories of
NF and ERR constructs measured during mid/late-childhood through early/mid-adolescence. Aim 2:
Investigate the potential mediating role of NF and ERR constructs on the association between PH status and
offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. Exploratory Aim: Test sex and race as potential moderators of ERR and NF
trajectories, and on the association between PH status and offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. This proposal’s central
hypotheses are that (1) PH+ status increases vulnerability for developmental trajectories characterized by NF
deficits and emotional dysfunction/dysregulation; (2) these trajectories will mediate the association between PH
status and youth NSSI, SI, and SA; and (3) these associations between trajectories and SB/NSSI will be
moderated by both sex and race. The hypotheses are informed by preliminary findings from the ongoing NIMH-
R21 study, where group differences were found for ERR, SB, and NF. The proposed R01 study aligns well with
the NIMH 2020 Strategic Plan for Research with emphasis on Goal 2-investigating mental health trajectories
and inclusion of diverse samples. Completing the proposed study will assist with the identification of specific
mechanisms associated with the familial risk of SB, determine if sex and race moderate the associations
between risks and youth SB, and provide direction for targeted prevention strategies for high-risk youth."
10852999,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vibrio cholerae (Vc), the causative agent of cholera, colonizes the mucosal surface of the small intestine. Infec-
tion is mediated via virulence factors to penetrate the mucus layer, attach to epithelial cells, and proliferate, all
the while modulating interactions with both host cells and the gut microbiota. The human gut microbiota is
highly diverse, and interpersonal variation in the structure and function of the microbiota drives dramatic differ-
ences in Vc colonization. At the center of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions lies the host mucus
layer, comprised of secreted mucin glycoproteins including the dominant mucin MUC-2. Mucus provides at-
tachment sites and carbon sources for both pathogens and commensal members of the gut microbiota at the
interface of the epithelium and the gut lumen, as provides a key physical barrier to infection. However, the role
of mucin metabolism in metabolic interchanges between Vc and specific configurations of the gut microbiota,
and the resulting impact on personalized Vc infection outcomes, has not been well studied. Here, we show that
TagA, a secreted metalloprotease upregulated by the Vc virulence master regulator ToxT, promotes Vc growth
in mucin, and that TagA is a bifunctional protein, acting as both mucinase and a mucus secretagogue that in-
duces host mucin production. Using a combination of ex vivo tissue culture and in vivo gnotobiotic mouse
colonization models combined with TagA mutants lacking either proteolytic activity or MUC2-inducing activity,
we found that TagA’s two activities have different effects on Vc fitness during infection depending on the pres-
ence of specific human gut microbes. We have generated model gut microbiota characteristic of human gut
microbiota states: one model microbial community similar to that of healthy individuals, which promotes Vc in-
fection resistance, and another model microbiota characteristic of the dysbiotic state found in cholera endemic
areas associated with high susceptibility to Vc colonization. TagA mucolytic activity is important for Vc infection
resistance within the colonization-resistant microbiota, while the mucin-inducing activity of TagA FN3 leads to
increased Vc infection within dysbiotic communities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Tag drives Vc metabolic
interactions with specific gut microbiota leading to community-specific attachment, growth, and overall infection
outcomes. We will test aspects of this core hypothesis in four specific aims. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms
driving mucin-dependent interactions of Vc with commensal gut microbes in epithelial attachment and growth.
Aim 2 will examine how personalized gut microbiota structure in cholera endemic areas modulates mucin- and
TagA-dependent disease phenotypes. Aim 3 will determine how TagA-microbiota interactions drives produc-
tion and metabolism of host mucins. Finally, Aim 4 will elucidate the role of proximity and spatial specificity in
driving microbiota-dependent Vc disease outcomes. The ultimate goal of this application is to shed light on the
role of pathogen-mediated mucin metabolism in microbial interactions during enteric infection."

Memory concerns are prevalent in healthy cognitive aging and are associated with lower quality of life. False
memory – remembering events differently than how they happened – increases across the lifespan. Older adults
also show a shift toward semantic memory – memory for concepts – and away from episodic memory – memory
for events within a spatiotemporal context. However, it is unclear how the shift toward semantic memory con-
tributes to increased false memory in older adults. An improved understanding of the mechanisms that give rise
to false memories across the lifespan will be the ﬁrst step toward alleviating memory concerns in healthy aging.
Using a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging approaches, this proposal aims to directly link semantic
bias to false memory in older adults. Experimental paradigms traditionally used to investigate false memory capi-
talize upon semantic overlap between study items to produce robust false memory effects; however, experiences
can also temporally overlap, or occur close together in time. Temporal overlap may differentially impact false
memory across the lifespan. Young adults can leverage temporal information to support true memories, and
preliminary data suggests that young adults can also utilize temporal information to reject false memories. How-
ever, older adults may have greater difﬁculty utilizing temporal information and thus be more susceptible to falsely
remembering. Therefore, identifying the relative contributions of semantic and episodic processing will improve
understanding of false memory increases in older adults. This proposal tests the hypothesis that older adults' bias
toward semantic processing modulates encoding mechanisms to promote false memory. To determine the extent
to which semantic versus episodic processing contribute to false memory, young and older adults will complete
a behavioral task in which temporal and semantic overlap between study items is manipulated, and then com-
plete a test of false memory. To establish a link between older adults' semantic bias and neural representations
of true and false memories, semantic overlap will be manipulated between study items and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure neural pattern similarity for true and false memories in young
and older adults. The proposed research is directly in line with the mission of the NIA, as the results of this pro-
posal will provide insight into memory impairments in healthy aging and serve as a ﬁrst step towards ameliorating
memory concerns to improve quality of life in older adulthood. Because healthy aging is characterized by subtle
cognitive changes, it can be difﬁcult to distinguish between cognitive declines due to typical aging and those due
to amnestic mild cognitive impairments or Alzheimer's Disease. Thus, a more thorough understanding of how the
mechanisms that give rise to false memories change in healthy aging will also provide a foundation for further
disambiguation of healthy aging from dementia."

With this K43 Career Development Award, I will develop the skills necessary to reach my ultimate goal of
becoming an independent investigator focused on the use of pharmacoepidemiology and experimental
pharmacology to inform improved strategies for achieving sustained viral suppression in HIV treatment.
Career Development Plan: My long-term career goal is to become an independently funded researcher with
expertise in pharmacoepidemiology (epidemiology and clinical pharmacology) to inform improved strategies
for achieving sustained viral suppression in HIV treatment. In the short-term during this K43 period, my goals
are to
Identify and characterize a retrospective cohort of PLWH in the IeDEA West Africa Database and
determine the epidemiology and predictors of HIV-1, HIV-2 low-level viremia (LLV) in the cohort; and to
determine the relationship between low-level viremia (LLV) and adherence to ART in a prospective cohort
using 3 different adherence measures (pharmacy refill records (PRR), innovative urine-tenofovir POC test,
and innovative TFV-DP in DBS). To attain these goals, I will be mentored during this K43 award period by a
group of experienced career scientists: Dr. Cecile Lahiri, a clinician scientist whose focus is on HIV
cure/eradication; Dr. Oliver Ezechi, a specialist in reproductive and population health whose focus is on the
clinical impact of infectious diseases on women and adolescent health; Dr Antoine Jaquet, a
clinician/epidemiologist with focus on the epidemiology of HIV and related chronic comorbidities; Dr. Igho
Ofotokun an HIV translational clinician scientist with focus on women’s health and Dr. Castillo-Mancilla, a
translational researcher focused on applied clinical pharmacology. For this K43 award, I will complete
coursework and hands-on training in large data analysis and experimental pharmacology, I will also conduct
research that exemplifies the undetectable = untransmissible (U=U) agenda with the goal of learning new
ways of monitoring adherence to achieve effective HIV treatments that will stop transmission and eliminate
HIV eventually. Merging my background in pharmacy practice in HIV care and infectious diseases, with
advanced analytic skills, mathematical modelling, epidemiology, and experimental pharmacology from this
K43, will give me the capacity for a career as an independent researcher.
Research Plan: Emerging evidence suggests that persistent low-level viremia (LLV) in persons with
HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a barrier to achieving the goal of zero transmission
and eradication of HIV1-8, but not much is known about the impact of LLV on attaining the goal of
viral suppression in West Africa; thus, this proposal aims to provide information vital to understand
the impact of LLV in ART outcomes in West Africa. It will also be important to understand if
differences exist between HIV-1 and HIV-2 treatment outcomes in the presence of LLV, since West
Africa is one of the few regions in the world where HIV-2 is endemic. While literature is unanimous
that sub-optimal adherence results in LLV, controversy surrounds the prognostic value of LLV for
clinical outcomes. Some studies attribute the cause of LLV to drug resistance and reactivation of
viral reservoirs, but other studies name these factors as consequences of LLV9-11. The
‘Undetectable=Untransmissible (U=U)’ concept is hinged on exploring pharmacologic, psycho-
socio-economic, and other interventions to improve adherence and achieve undetectable viral
load12,13. Individuals with LLV have been shown to be significantly less likely to subsequently
achieve complete undetectable viral load. The upper limit of LLV (200-1000 copies/ml), has also
been shown to be associated with virologic failure, development of resistance to ARVs, AIDS events
and AIDS-related deaths1. Current WHO guidelines do not advise monitoring or treatment
interventions even after repeated measurements of low-level viraemia. Consequently, patients are
kept on failing ART regimens. Non-monitoring of LLV may result in an epidemic of resistance to
currently used antiretrovirals and poor clinical prognosis in PLWH. Thus, it is vital to understand the
predictors of LLV and its impact on PLWH, to inform improved clinical care of PLWH. Our proposed
aims are: 1).
To identify and characterize a cohort of from the IeDEA West Africa Database and
determine the epidemiology and predictors of low-level viremia (LLV) in the cohort (for HIV-1 and
HIV-2) and ii). Establish a prospective cohort of PLWH in Lagos, Nigeria, to estimate adherence to
ART, using 3 different adherence measures (pharmacy refill records (PRR), innovative urine tenofovir
POC test, and innovative TFV-DP in DBS). To accomplish this, We will assess the prevalence of LLV in a
large West African database (IeDEA West Africa) and also determine the relationship between adherence
with low-level viremia (LLV) in a cohort of 272 PLWH in Lagos, Nigeria and predict future LLV. This will be a
2-year follow-up prospective longitudinal study (3-monthly appointments for urine and DBS collection and 6-
monthly viral load testing)."

improve cardiovascular health and function however few wheelchair users are currently meeting the
recommended amounts of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity (3 times per week ~30 minutes per session).
There are many barriers to achieving ample PA including lack of transportation to PA facilities and programs,
social support, motivation and access to accessible fitness equipment and knowledgeable trainers. An
accessible, motivating, socially supported, and effective exercise option that wheelchair users can participate
in from home could help mitigate these barriers to engaging in routine PA. With the onset of the pandemic
came a wealth of home-based smart connected exercise devices and fitness apps that enable for interactive
video based instruction, virtual/augmented reality world exercise experiences, and integrated social networking
features (e.g. group exercise, leaderboards) for the able-bodied market. These applications have been found
to improve intrinsic motivation through social support and enjoyment in addition to PA levels and performance.
However, these technologies are largely exclusive of persons with disabilities due to the inability to use the
connected fitness equipment. Current upper-arm ergometers have limited internet connectivity. Handcycles
can be adapted to smart connected bike trainers for use in the home but they require a customized set up that
requires a difficult transfer and a lot of space. Therefore, we propose to develop a home-based, smart
connected upper-arm ergometer that would enable wheelchairs users to more easily and effectively participate
in video and virtual reality-based fitness apps that have social components and motivational features. The
specific aims of this study are: 1) to iteratively develop a prototype home-based, smart connected upper-arm
cycling trainer (ParaCycle) 2) verify the functionality of the ParaCycle through in lab testing with wheelchair
users; and 3) conduct a 6-week in-home pilot study with the refined ParaCycle prototype to evaluate its
functionality, safety, utility and device satisfaction. For Aim 1, we will develop ParaCycle in accordance with
engineering standards related to the manufacturing of connected fitness equipment and involving end users
and stakeholders in the design review process. In Aim 2, 15 wheelchair users will be tested on the setup and
use of the device (>68 on the System Usability Scale), the ability of ParaCycle to elicit moderate to high
intensity exercise (average session power between 76% and 87% functional threshold power), and a high level
of enjoyment (Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale > 100). For Aim 3, a 6-week in-home study will be conducted
with 10 wheelchair users to assess functionality (e.g. ability to maintain continuous communication with the
fitness apps and remotely transmit fitness data); safety (e.g. adverse events as a result of device use) and
utility (e.g. how often the device is used) and level of satisfaction."

Cholera continues to be a global burden manifesting as acute diarrheal disease that impacts impoverished and
destabilized regions. Bacteria including Vibrio cholerae utilize the Type II Secretion System (T2SS) for the
secretion of a diverse array of effector proteins and toxins to adapt to environmental changes, notably cholera
toxin the causative agent of cholera symptoms. While a variety of T2SS substrates including cholera toxin are
fully secreted, a subset is retained on the cell surface. A recently identified group of diverse substrates found in
some gram-negative bacteria including V. cholerae contains a homologous C-terminal domain, called the GlyGly-
Cterm, that targets its passenger proteins to the cell surface. This newly identified domain is processed by
rhombosortase, a subfamily of rhomboid protease, before T2SS transport. It remains unclear what sequence of
the GlyGly-Cterm is required for surface localization, what, if any, enzymes in addition to rhombosortase are
responsible for GlyGly-Cterm protein maturation, and importantly, why V. cholerae have this distinct surface-
retention system. Model protein, VesB from V. cholerae, will be used to probe the molecular requirements of the
GlyGly-Cterm domain by employing fluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation, and activity assays. Additional
genes coding for putative enzymes possibly involved in processing of GlyGly-Cterm proteins have been identified
in an ordered V. cholerae transposon library screen. This will be followed up on by generating clean gene
deletions and assessing VesB surface localization. Quantitative and spatial proteomics as well as enzymatic
assays will be used to characterize the role of these gene products. The importance of the GlyGly-Cterm will be
probed by expressing GlyGly-Cterm proteins with and without this extension. Currently characterized cell-surface
associated bacterial enzymes are almost exclusively retained by N-terminal lipidation, while the GlyGly-Cterm
system represents a novel C-terminal cell-surface anchoring mechanism. The enzymes containing a
GlyGly-Cterm are involved in a variety of functions contributing to V. cholerae environmental persistence and
pathogenesis including nutrient acquisition, biofilm formation, and potentially maintenance of membrane
integrity. The importance of GlyGly-Cterm proteins is demonstrated by disruption of rhombosortase, which
results in impaired cell growth, reduced biofilm formation, and sensitivity to membrane stress. Characterization
of this system has the potential to explain why some bacteria have evolved this unique cell-surface retention
system and may provide insight into conserved mechanisms of C-terminal membrane anchoring in higher
organisms."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is uniquely difficult to treat due to late diagnosis and limited medical
management options for a majority of patients. This is despite a wealth of watershed studies on disease driver
mechanisms over the past decade, highlighting a need for alternative approaches to studying this disease. It is
now clear that PDACs present along a bimodal continuum of transcriptomic subtypes that exhibit distinct
prognoses, and additional work on advanced PDAC models has uncovered that these tumors, though highly
chemoresistant, are sensitive to external amino acid supply through metabolic dysregulation. Transcripts that
define known PDAC molecular subtypes present unique codon biases, suggesting that PDACs are subject to
biologically deterministic codon-level selective pressures. Work from our lab and others has shown that the
abundance of properly aminoacylated transfer RNAs (tRNAs), highly structured and chemically modified non-
coding RNAs, is highly deterministic of mRNA half-life. This mechanism acts through codon-anticodon
recognition and ribosome elongation rate, and alterations of functional tRNA abundance can dictate cellular
functions via concomitant regulation of mRNA stability. Furthermore, a wealth of literature evidence in diverse
cell types across species demonstrates that tRNA regulation can be disease-specific. Thus, tRNAs may likely
serve a key regulatory role in PDAC subtype expression and amino acid sensitivity, given their function in
bridging codon-amino acid pairings during protein production.
As proof of concept, I have strong preliminary evidence that tRNA expression can be highly predictive of disease
stage in a limited cohort of primary colorectal tumor samples. Furthermore, a pilot study of PDACs revealed
widespread tRNA dysregulation, with increased use of cysteine-decoding transcripts, matching existing literature
that PDACs are specifically sensitive to deprivation of this amino acid. In this proposal, I seek to interrogate
linked roles of tRNAs as regulators of mRNA and nutrient availability phenotypes in PDAC. My central hypothesis
is that PDACs specifically regulate tRNA expression to confer cell survival and proliferation advantages and that
tRNA profiling can reveal novel biomarkers for use in clinical decision-making. I will address this hypothesis
through the following aims: Aim 1: Characterize tRNA expression and modifications in primary patient PDACs;
Aim 2: Investigate PDAC tRNA regulation as a driver of tumor cell survival. These aims will be achieved through
a combination of biochemical and high-throughput sequencing approaches using archived patient samples and
established in vitro cell lines. Beyond biological interrogation, this proposal involves novel technical development
in the experimental and analytical application of tRNA sequencing for large patient sample cohorts. This project
would be the first to analyze tRNA gene-specific regulation in cancer, and will be significant in that it may reveal
novel targetable mechanisms of PDAC maintenance and a potent set of disease-associated clinical features that
are likely to inform fundamental cancer biology."

Migration is a social determinant of health which has profound and long-lasting health consequences, and
contributes to the significant disparities in mental health outcomes experienced by Latina immigrants. Shifts in
migration patterns from Latin America over the last decades – driven in part by sociopolitical conflict, organized
violence, and evolving gender norms – have contributed to unprecedented growth in the population of Latinas in
the US. Latina immigrants face cumulative exposure to an array of traumatic experiences before, during, and
after migration – including sexual assault, natural disasters, kidnapping, separation from/and death of family
members, and deprivation of basic needs. These are deeply traumatic experiences which are associated with
poor mental health outcomes (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety). Presently, suicide is a
leading cause of death among Latinas in the U.S., but there is limited research seeking to identify the distinct
factors that heighten the risk of suicide and that promote resilience among Latina immigrants. Furthermore, there
is a significant gap in knowledge regarding Latina immigrant’s lived experiences with suicide and migration-
related trauma and understanding how these women utilize communal and cultural resources – such as
communal coping, collective rituals, and traditional gatherings – to cope with the collective impact of migration-
related trauma and chronic stress. This exploratory sequential mixed-methods study aims to generate a rich
understanding of the experiences of Latina immigrants with migration-related trauma, suicide and suicidal
ideation, and social stressors, and to identify salient cultural and communal factors that shape these experiences.
This will be accomplished through the following aims: 1a) explore how exposure to migration-related trauma,
communal coping, and social stressors influence the risk of suicidal ideation and mental health symptoms among
adult Latina immigrants (n=20) using individual interviews and focus groups; 1b) understand community
providers’ and team members’ (promotoras, nurses, and clinicians) (n=16-20) perspectives of how migration-
related trauma, communal coping, and social stressors impact the mental health outcomes of Latina immigrants
using focus groups; 2) examine how migration-related trauma, social stressors, communal coping and other
salient cultural, migratory, and communal factors impact suicidal ideation and mental health symptoms among
Latina immigrants using a cross-sectional survey; and 3) collaborate with community partners and the community
advisory board to interpret and integrate findings and identify risk and resilience factors that shape experiences
with suicide and the mental health outcomes of Latina immigrants. This innovative study builds on over a year
of preliminary work, including community engagement efforts, a systematic review of the literature and concept

mentorship team, our community partners at Centro SOL, and the Latino(a) immigrant community in the
Baltimore Metropolitan Area. To our knowledge, this innovative proposal will be the first to explore the impact of
migration-related trauma (across the stages of migration), social stressors, communal coping, and other salient
cultural and communal factors on the mental health outcomes of Latina immigrants."

In response to hemodynamic demands faced by the heart, cardiomyocytes adapt and remodel primarily through
changes in myocyte thickness or length. In conditions like cardiovascular exercise, changes in physiological
hypertrophy can aid in improving cardiac function. However, in conditions of prolonged elevated blood pressure,
heart rate, and excessive weight gain, pathological hypertrophy occurs and ultimately can contribute to heart
failure. Changes in cardiomyocyte growth and atrophy that subsequently impact physiological and pathological
cardiac remodeling are dictated by changes in protein synthesis. And while there is significant progress in
understanding the transcriptional and translational changes that mediate maladaptive cardiac remodeling, little
is known about the changes in the most abundant noncoding RNAs that link these two processes: transfer RNAs
(tRNA). Outside of the notion that Polymerase III activity, which is required for tRNA transcription, increases in
response to cardiac pressure overload, almost completely nothing is known about how alterations in tRNA
transcription, transport, and localization impact sites of protein synthesis and, ultimately, cardiac remodeling.
Considering that heart failure and the preceding changes in myocyte size contribute to the majority of deaths in
the United States, there is an unmet need for new therapies that target malignant protein synthesis in pathological
cardiac hypertrophy. Hence, this need may be met by identifying new regulating transcription and translational
control from a novel tRNA-centric view. In this proposal, we will examine the relationship between tRNA
transcription, transport, and localization in cardiac homeostasis and hypertrophy. We have identified that tRNAs,
which are believed to primarily rely on passive diffusion for appropriate localization, require the microtubule
network for proper localization in the heart. We hypothesize that pathological and physiological hypertrophy
induce different changes in tRNA transcription; but that both types of growth require motor protein-mediated
active transport of tRNAs along the microtubule network to facilitate necessary increases in protein synthesis for
cardiomyocyte growth. We will test our hypothesis by carrying out the following aims: (1) To determine the role
of microtubules in tRNA trafficking and localization in the cardiomyocyte. (2) To characterize the localization and
expression of mammalian tRNAs during cardiac remodeling. (3) To identify the proteins that facilitate tRNA
trafficking in cardiomyocytes. This work will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Benjamin Prosser, an expert
on microtubules, cardiomyocyte mRNA trafficking, and cardiac remodeling. Successful completion of this work
will have the positive impact of defining how changes in tRNA transcription, localization, and trafficking impact
cardiac homeostasis and hypertrophy and thus result in the potential new strategies that target heart failure
through the regulation of maladaptive protein synthesis and compromised cardiac cell size."

Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women
and is projected to increase by 70% in the next 20 years. One of the earliest initiating events of CRC is
mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a tumor suppressor gene. This mutation initiates the gradual
progression from normal proliferating colon epithelial cells (CECs) to dysplastic lesions, to the eventual
formation of tumors, known as adenomas. Somatic APC mutations occur in >80% of sporadic CRCs. Growing
evidence demonstrates that factors within the local microenvironment can significantly influence cancer risk
and onset. One key characteristic of the colon adenomatous environment is an imbalanced microbiome.
Disruption in the makeup of these microbiota, known as dysbiosis, is related to many diseases, including
colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and CRC. While dysbiosis contributes to promoting adenoma progression
and CRC, whether APC mutation triggers changes in the local microenvironment to facilitate tumor progression
and microbiome dysbiosis remains largely unknown. Using an inducible murine model of CEC Apc truncation,
our lab found that Apc inactivation and subsequent colon tumorigenesis results in microbiome dysbiosis and
outgrowth of pathogenic species, further, associated with increased bacterial mucosal adherence. This
proposal aims to define the timing and mechanisms by which the early microbiome changes following Apc
inactivation. We hypothesize that Apc loss alters the microenvironment to cause early loss of commensal
species and provides a habitat for pathogenic outgrowth and pro-carcinogenesis. We will test our hypothesis
through the following aims. Aim 1: Defining the effects of Apc inactivation on the composition, spatial/temporal
dynamics, and tumorigenic potential of the host microbiome. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and
microbiology, I will identify early microbiome changes following Apc loss during gradual colon tumorigenesis
and will determine if this differs by colon region. I will use germ-free models to evaluate if the changing
microbiome is sufficient to induce colon tumorigenesis. Aim 2: Identifying the mechanism(s) by which Apc
inactivation contributes to microbiome dysbiosis and the expansion of pathogenic species. I will utilize
transcriptomics and metabolomics to examine changes in metabolic pathways and gene regulation in
association with changes in microbiome composition and timing of Apc inactivation. This research will provide
novel insights into the events occurring upon Apc mutation and the crosstalk between mutated CECs and the
local microbiome."

This proposal will explore a new axis of dopaminergic regulation–microglial expression of the dopamine
receptor DRD1 and their modulation of neuronal activity and excitability in response to changing dopamine
levels. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, exhibit a wide array of functions,
some stereotypical of macrophages and some unique to the brain. Recent research from our lab and others
has demonstrated that one such function is to modulate neuronal activity, but how and why they do so is still
under investigation. Microglia exhibit a high degree of regional heterogeneity in form and function, perhaps to
account for the diversity of local cues and demands of different brain regions. A growing body of literature
suggests that microglia possess the ability to express receptor transcripts for and respond to an array of
neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and that expression of these may vary by region, activity, or disease
state. Our lab has uncovered a unique subpopulation of microglia that express the dopamine receptor DRD1
(D1) in the striatum. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward, motivation, voluntary motor behavior,
and substance use disorders. How, when, and why microglial DRD1 expression emerges remains unclear, and
I will confront each of these questions with my proposed experiments. I will trace the ontogeny of microglial
DRD1 through development using several transgenic mouse models to investigate when microglial DRD1
expression begins, from where D1+ microglia originate, if not the striatum, and if expression/maintenance is
dependent upon dopaminergic input. I will also use cutting-edge microglia transplant techniques to determine if
microglia can acquire DRD1 in the striatum, which will provide important evidence for the role of local cues in
microglial phenotypic determination, an open question in the field. Additionally, preliminary data from our lab
have demonstrated that D1+ microglia may be able to modulate the neuronal and behavioral response to
dopamine. Ablation of microglia overall and D1+ microglia specifically both amplify the locomotor response to
chronic cocaine, which increases dopamine levels by blocking reuptake. Changing dopamine levels are
characteristic of a number of physiological, developmental, and environmental events. In this proposal, I will
explore two that are associated with an adaptation of striatal medium spiny neuron excitability: juvenile
dopaminergic development and chronic cocaine. Based on our data, I hypothesize that D1+ microglia sense
and respond to dopamine in order to tune neuronal excitability to changing dopamine levels throughout the
lifetime. Exploring the role of D1+ microglia in dopaminergic signaling is critical to understanding the
dopaminergic dysfunction that characterizes numerous neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including
substance use disorder, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and ADHD, and could provide novel therapeutic
targets for those that have thus far found few effective treatment options."

Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) cause motoneuron (MN) axotomy, endangering MNs to cell death which results
in individuals never achieving a full functional recovery. Therefore, identifying the mechanisms which govern
selective MN loss following an injury or insult is crucial for therapeutic advancement in MN disease and for
improving patient outcomes. Research has shown microglia become activated, proliferate and migrate to injured
MN cell bodies after PNI, displaying a range of characteristics from pro-regenerative to degenerative. Currently,
it is unknown what types of microglia-MN interactions occur on injured MNs destined for survival or cell death. It
is also unknown how microglia monitor MN health status, how this relates to MN fate, or what signaling
mechanisms regulate these relationships. Our objective is to identify microglial dynamics and cellular
communication with injured MNs that determine MN fate following PNI. We will first visualize microglia-MN
interactions using advanced microscopy methods and then probe for signaling mechanisms that may regulate
microglia behavior on MNs of various health statuses. Colony Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1), Triggering Receptor
Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), and Fc Receptors (FcR) have all been independently shown to modulate
microglial activation via DNAX activating protein of 12kDa (DAP12) and Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK)
activation. Literature has shown CSF1 is necessary for microglia proliferation and migration towards injured MNs.
Preliminary data shows FcRs are expressed on all activated microglia, whereas TREM2 has a greater expression
on microglia surrounding dying MNs compared to surviving or healthy MNs. Given the previous research and
our preliminary findings, I predict that microglia will display different dynamics and uptake of MN content
depending on the MN health status and that the switch between protective to death environments is
governed by the degree of synergistic activation of DAP12 and SYK; more specifically that TREM2 is acting
as a molecular switch. To test this, I will use a PNI mouse model (sciatic axotomy) with microglia genetically
labeled with GFP and axotomized MNs retrogradely labeled from muscle. This will allow the investigation of
microglial-MN interactions on injured MNs of different health statuses. In aim 1, I will quantitatively characterize
microglia-MN dynamics with confocal, two-photon, and super-resolution STED microscopy. This aim will reveal
how microglia could change from sampling MN contents through endocytosis or trogocytosis to MN removal by
neuronal phagocytosis. In aim 2, I will investigate signaling mechanisms that govern microglial phenotypes and
their subsequent effect on MN fate. Specifically, we will develop a TREM2 microglia knock-out mouse model to
analyze resulting microglia phenotypes and MN interactions, signaling cascades, and any effects on MN
regeneration or cell death. This research will provide foundations for neuroprotective interventions after PNI. The
signaling and cellular interactions revealed could be transferable to other neuropathologies."

Memory consolidation is an indispensable function for everyday experiences that becomes compromised in
many prevalent memory disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and dementia. Understanding the
underlying process of memory consolidation is essential for the development of therapeutics and treatment
interventions for pervasive memory disorders. Systems consolidation, memory consolidation across neural
networks, involves the transformation of impermanent, hippocampus-dependent memories, into permanent
long-term memories stored throughout cortical regions. During this consolidation process, sharp-wave ripples
(SPWs), neural oscillations originating from the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus during slow wave sleep
(SWS), have emerged as a key mediator. These oscillations facilitate systems consolidation through the
reactivation of hippocampal and cortical neurons previously active during wakefulness. Recently, researcher
have identified two anatomically distinct CA1 pyramidal sublayers that differ in function during SPWs:
superficial and deep. Superficial neurons (CA1sup) display more stable firings rates exhibiting little change in
response to learning, whereas deep neurons (CA1deep) are less stable exhibiting dynamic changes to
learning. While these differences have been uncovered, much remains unknown on how sublayers are
selectively recruited during SPWs. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cortical region involved long-term
memory, emerges as a possible candidate in driving CA1 activity. The ACC exhibits increased activity
immediately preceding SPWs and dCA1 neuronal firings, suggesting a potential ACC → dCA1 influence. Our
results revealed that ACC neural activity immediately preceding SPWs (~200ms prior) preferentially predicts
CA1deep neuron activity during SPWs. Prediction success increases following learning, suggesting a role of
ACC → CA1deep communication in learning. Additionally, we show that stimulation of ACC excitatory neurons
specifically increases the activity of CA1deep, but not CA1sup, during SWS. Given these findings, I
hypothesize that ACC neurons selectively communicate with CA1deep activity during SPWs post-learning, and
this communication is necessary for consolidation of newly-acquired memories. I will test this hypothesis
through the following two aims. Aim 1 will utilize dual-site extracellular in vivo electrophysiology to determine
how the ACC and dCA1 neurons communicate during SPW events for memory consolidation. Aim 2 will
implement closed-loop optogenetics to investigate the causal role ACC → CA1deep communication during
SPWs in memory consolidation. Findings from this proposal will advance our understanding of systems
consolidation and how the brain stores long-term memories. Results from this study would lay the framework
for the development of future therapeutic interventions targeted towards memory disorders."

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are devastating conditions that rob individuals of their cognitive function,
mobility, and ability to function in the world. Ultimately, many of these diseases are fatal. Today, a combined
6.5 million Americans suffer from NDDs, encompassing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD),
multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD). However, by
2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be over the age of 65, and because NDDs strike primarily in mid- to late-life, the
incidence is expected to soar as our population ages. These circumstances highlight the increasing urgency for
the development of effective treatments and cures for NDDs, which are currently lacking. While NDDs differ in
their inciting mechanisms, research has now clearly demonstrated the presence of shared features of
downstream pathophysiology, notably, the role of a dysregulated neuroinflammatory system. Recent studies in
humans and animal models have uncovered a population of microglia (Disease-associated microglia, DAMs),
that are defined by a distinct transcriptional signature, and are conserved across several different NDDs.
Intriguingly, the DAM signature includes upregulation of a number of different members of the MS4A gene
family, for which polymorphisms have been linked to AD by numerous genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). The upregulation of AD-associated MS4A genes in DAMs begs the questions of whether MS4A
genes might play a common role in NDDs, which share a DAM signature, and furthermore, whether MS4A
genes impact the functional properties of microglia in the context of NDDs. Excitingly, our lab has found that
across three animal NDD models (5XFAD, MAPT, SOD1G93A), mice deficient for either of two individual Ms4a
family members exhibit improved disease phenotypes, extension of lifespan, and amelioration of
histopathological disease hallmarks. Thus, this proposal will test the hypothesis that multiple MS4As act in
concert to drive pathology in a mouse model of ALS and regulate microglial transcriptional as well as functional
responses to the NDD milieu. To test this hypothesis, aim 1 will investigate the impact of simultaneous deletion
of the entire MS4A gene family on ALS. To this end, we have generated a novel mouse genetic reagent in
which the entire MS4A gene cluster is deleted. These mice will be crossed to the SOD1G93A ALS mouse model
and pathological features of ALS, including motor defects, lifespan, microgliosis, neuronal loss, and synapse
elimination will be assessed. Aim 2 will examine the impact of MS4A deficiency on the transcriptional and
functional properties of spinal cord microglia isolated from end-stage SOD1G93A mice. Specifically, I will utilize
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in tandem with spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) to evaluate the
impact of MS4A deletion on the DAM population. In parallel, I will examine how MS4A deficiency in vivo affects
the key microglial function of phagocytosis. Together, these aims will provide fundamental new insight into the
role of MS4As in ALS and contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches targeting MS4A receptors."

 Caloric restriction and reduced mTOR signaling mitigate the adverse effects of aging. They do not translate
into effective anti-aging therapies though, because diets are difficult to maintain and mTOR inhibitors exhibit
undesirable side effects. The transcription factor CEBPB drives many of the undesirable effects of aging
downstream of the TOR pathway. The levels of its short isoform called LIP increase with age; loss of LIP
increases lifespan and provides health benefits, while expression of LIP alone increase tumorigenicity.
Reprogramming CEBPB and LIP therefore holds great promise as a tool to control aging.
 Pioneering studies indicated that LIP activates transcription of its target genes, while the canonical long
isoform of CEBPB, LAP, is a transcription repressor. Recent evidence draws a more complex picture:
 - both isoforms are extensively modified by phosphorylation, acetylation (and many others), and those
 modifications impact their activity;
 - dimerization of CEBPB with other factors impacts its function;
 - finally, LIP rescues CEBPB knock-out, suggesting that LIP is not simply a dominant negative inert
isoform.
 Understanding how these regulatory dimensions are integrated by CEBPB isoforms is a pre-requisite to
develop technologies able to reprogram aging.
 Here, we deploy synthetic biology approaches in order to dissect how the CEBPB isoforms, their
dimerization partners and post-translational modifications impact the nuclear dynamics of CEBPB and its
transcription regulation activity.
 We also develop synthetic tools to visualize and perturb the LAP:LIP ratio in individual cells. Being able to
perturb aging regulators in single cells will enable measuring the contributions of cell-autonomous aging
phenotypes and those driven by signals between cells. It will also provide precise tools to dissect one of the
common hallmarks of aging: increased heterogeneity of expression."

coordination of all Program-related activities associated with the Research Projects, Cores, the Executive
Committee, the Internal and External Advisory Boards, and the Community Analysis, Results, and Dissemination
(CARD) Board.
Specifically, the Administrative Core will support the Program by integrating various tasks, including 1) providing
leadership and oversight of all Program activities involving Research Projects and the Data Collection and
Clinical Genetics Core; 2) facilitating communication between Program participants, the National Cancer
Institute, and the general public; 3) overseeing fiscal and resource management for each component of the
Program including subcontracts with Duke University, University of Michigan and NorthShore Research Institute;
4) ensuring compliance with all NIH and institutional grant regulations; 5) developing measures to evaluate the
progress and effectiveness of each component of the Program; and 6) soliciting guidance and objective feedback
from the Internal and External Advisory Boards, and the Community Analysis, Results, and Dissemination Board,
and coordinating those meetings.
The Administrative Core contributes to the overall efficiency of the Program by leveraging the existing
administrative infrastructure of KCI, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Metropolitan Detroit
Cancer Surveillance System population-based registry, and the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS)
cohort for the successful management of the Program. This strong administrative infrastructure will enable
investigators to fully concentrate on the science of cancer genetics and health disparities."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey’s (CINJ) catchment area is home to the 4th most diverse population
in the nation and, as such, deserves an oncology workforce that reflects this diversity. CINJ established the
Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) in 2021, led by a newly recruited Associate Director for Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer, Dr. Haejin In. The mission of PED is to foster systemic and
structural changes that will accelerate the diversification and inclusive excellence of Center trainees, Members,
and leaders. The ODEI has two full-time staff and an interprofessional steering committee to develop, implement,
and evaluate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts across the institution in collaboration with Cancer
Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC), Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), Center
Administration’s Office for Faculty Recruitment and Affairs (cFRA), and senior leadership. ODEI has conducted
a comprehensive needs assessment and gap analysis, including evaluation of Member demographics,
satisfaction surveys, and focus groups. This assessment suggested that, although CINJ faculty and leadership
viewed diversifying the workforce as a positive goal, there was limited awareness of existing racial and gender
inequities and no structured programming to address these deficiencies. Analysis also showed a critical lack of
under-represented groups (URGs) among trainees, faculty, and leadership at CINJ and revealed issues of
inequities in URGs in the faculty applicant pool, less ability to recruit faculty and retain faculty who are from
URGs, as well as fewer URG faculty in leadership positions. To address these gaps, the PED has four aims: 1)
foster a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable organizational environment; 2) increase diversity in undergraduate
students, graduate students, and post-doctoral trainees; 3) promote the implementation of equity-based
processes and evidence-based strategies to diversify faculty recruitment and retain diverse faculty; and 4)
champion the creation and implementation of programs to identify, develop, and sponsor diverse faculty for
leadership. To achieve these aims, ODEI will implement a rigorous and regular assessment and evaluation of
programs and outcomes, and work collaboratively with CTREC, COE, and cFRA. PED success and impact will
be measured by metrics of engagement and satisfaction of DEI Program participants, increases in URG and
women applicants in each stage of the hiring process, and revised policies that are rooted in equity-minded,

Members (versus 41 for the previous funding cycle, hereafter ‘previously’) with diverse expertise, representing
21 Departments, 7 Schools, and 2 Universities, under the strong, complementary leadership of Drs. X.F.
Steven Zheng and Stephen K. Burley. CP research is focused on understanding the biology of key molecular
targets in cancer that drive cell growth, proliferation and survival so that they can be effectively targeted for
cancer therapy, to determine the modes of action and mechanisms of resistance to anticancer agents, and to
discover and develop novel therapeutics and drug delivery technologies for more effective cancer treatment.
CP was rated Outstanding to Excellent in the previous CCSG competitive renewal. In response to opportunities
for improvement identified by the review team, we developed and implemented a CP Program Strategic Plan
aligned with the overall CINJ Strategic Plan. Substantial progress has been made during the current funding
period. Outcomes include higher impact scientific and technological advancements, more effective translational
research, tighter focus on Catchment Area (CA) Priorities, and Community Outreach and Engagement
(COE). These accomplishments were enabled by strategic recruitment, intra/inter-programmatic teamwork within
the Cancer Center and with external collaborators both nationally and internationally, peer-reviewed, cancer-
relevant funding and multi-principal investigator (MPI) grants, community engagement, commitment to
mentorship of new/early career faculty and trainees, and increased representation of Princeton faculty in the

$6.5M previously), and more NCI funding ($4.3M versus $3.2M previously) and published 656 impactful, peer-
reviewed and cancer-relevant papers with 36% (versus 13% previously) appearing in high impact (impact
factor>10) journals (e.g., Cell, Nature, Science, Molecular Cell, Cell Metabolism, Nature Cancer). In addition
to basic science and technology achievements, CP members developed mathematical models to improve
treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint and chemotherapies, and novel small molecule, biologic and nano
therapeutics, and precision base-editing technology tested in clinical trials and/or licensed to biopharmaceutical
companies, significantly strengthening the Cancer Center’s translational pipeline.
Moving forward, CP will pursue integrative, multi-disciplinary approaches to research, development and

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an extremely aggressive disease with poor overall survival.
Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the current forms of immunotherapy benefit only less
than 15% of HNSCC patients. Therefore, there exists a critical need for new strategies for achieving powerful
immune responses. STING (stimulator of IFN genes) is considered one of the key immune regulators that could
convert non-responders to responders. Given the critical role of the STING pathway in cancer immunity, many
pharmaceutical companies are racing to establish their discovery pipelines for STING agonists. However,
conventional STING agonists have major limitations. Most STING agonists in clinical trials now are administrated
via intratumoral injection due to their poor pharmaceutical properties. This precludes their applicability for the
treatment of metastatic cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and develop new STING agonists
that can eliminate advanced cancer in an effective and safe manner. Here, we propose to develop the next-
generation STING agonist nanoparticles with potent anti-tumor efficacy, favorable pharmaceutical properties,
and acceptable safety profiles. We will develop novel STING agonist-based therapeutics and evaluate their
efficacy in advanced animal models and perform large animal toxicity studies."

The goal of this project is to understand how ribosomal RNA methylation can regulate translation of specific
proteins to regulate aging. Disruption of the proteome is a hallmark of aging. Having the capacity to express
the appropriate protein in response to environmental cues is an essential and evolutionarily conserved
process. Therefore, preserving the proteome is critical for maintaining organismal health and healthy aging.
However, how aging-responsive mRNAs are selectively translated is unknown. We recently identified that
ribosomal RNA methylation could facilitate the translation of a specific subset of proteins. Additionally, we
characterized how ribosome occupancy changes as an organism ages and determined that changes in
ribosomal DNA methylation are sufficient to project the organismal age. Whether ribosomal RNA methylation
plays a role in preserving proteome integrity as organisms age is still unclear. We have recently found that
enzymes which regulate RNA methylation and RNA methylation itself are dysregulated during aging and in
response to stress. We found that an N6-adenosine methyltransferase, METL-5, directly methylates adenosine
1717 on 18S ribosomal RNA in C. elegans. Methylation of adenosine 1717 enhances ribosomal binding and
selective translation of specific mRNAs. Our preliminary data shows that metl-5 deficient animals grow
normally under homeostatic conditions; however, metl-5 mutants are resistant to a variety of stresses,
including heat shock and UV irradiation. We also have preliminary data that deletion of an N6-dimethyl
adenosine (m6,2A) methyltransferase, DIMT-1, which methylates adenosines 1735 and 1736 on 18S rRNA
regulates selective ribosomal binding and translation of specific mRNAs and causes increased longevity and
stress resistance. Thus, methylation of specific residues of the 18S rRNA by METL-5 or DIMT-1 selectively
enhances translation of specific transcripts to regulate stress resistance and longevity. However, whether
rRNA methylation more broadly can regulate age and stress-responsive translation and how this dysregulation
drives the aging process is still unknown. Our preliminary findings suggest that ribosomal RNA methylation can
facilitate selective translation of specific transcripts providing another layer of regulation of the stress response
and aging. Capitalizing on this preliminary data we will use genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches
both in vitro and in vivo to dissect the role of rRNA methylation in regulating aging and stress resistance. Our
underlying hypothesis is that rRNA methylation promotes ribosome heterogeneity in response to stress
conditions and aging to facilitate the appropriate translation of stress resistance transcripts."

 Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting >800,000
Americans annually. A delicate balance of repair and remodeling processes is required to preserve the structural
integrity and reinforce the injured myocardium following MI. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are among the most
numerous cell types in the heart and play an essential role in fibrotic remodeling. Following ischemic injury,
surviving CFs exhibit a highly dynamic response involving the transition into an activated phenotype
characterized by increased proliferation, migration to the infarct region, and secretion of fibrotic proteins. Further,
CFs secrete a battery of paracrine signals to help coordinate the organ-level response to injury. Thus, proper
healing requires dynamic spatial and temporal control over CF function. Dysregulation of the CF response to
injury promotes pathological fibrosis, increased risk for arrhythmia, and cardiac dysfunction. While there have
been many studies exploring the diverse signaling cascades and stressors that cause CF activation, the precise
molecular pathways responsible for orchestrating dynamic changes in CF function across spatial and temporal
scales are not well understood.
 Spectrin proteins are important for providing structural membrane support and spatiotemporal regulation
for cell signaling events. Recent work identified stress-induced loss of βIV-spectrin, to be an important step in CF
activation and fibrosis. Further, loss of βIV-spectrin was found to depend on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII). A broader role has been identified for βIV-spectrin/CaMKII in regulating CF gene expression
through an interaction with signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3), a signaling molecule and
transcription factor that promotes profibrotic mechanisms. Specifically, CaMKII is activated and promotes loss of
βIV-spectrin and redistribution of STAT3 to the nucleus that lead to changes in fibrotic gene expression. Further,
we identified a molecular switch for βIV-spectrin stability involving direct phosphorylation by calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Together these data support our central hypothesis that βIV-spectrin
coordinates a tunable network for temporal and spatial control of CF function and the normal healing process
following MI. These studies seek to offer new mechanistic insight into how the myocardial repair process is
orchestrated and to improve therapeutic options for patients who have experienced MI."
10780482,"Title of Project: “Solving longstanding mysteries in plasma triglyceride metabolism”
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this Multiple Principal Investigator (PI) R01 grant is to solve persistent mysteries in the molecular
physiology of plasma triglyceride (TG) metabolism. The PIs, Loren Fong (UCLA) and Michael Ploug (Finsen
Laboratory, Copenhagen), are international leaders in TG metabolism. Fong, a cell biologist and physiologist,
discovered that GPIHBP1, an endothelial cell (EC) protein, captures LPL within the interstitial spaces (where it
is secreted by parenchymal cells) and moves it to the capillary lumen. Ploug, a physiologist and protein chemist
with specialized expertise in biophysical methods, quantified GPIHBP1–LPL interactions; showed that GPIHBP1
stabilizes LPL; and discovered that ANGPTL4 inhibits LPL activity by catalyzing unfolding of LPL’s hydrolase
domain. For 11 years, the UCLA and Finsen Laboratory groups have collaborated on the physiology and
biophysics of TG metabolism, publishing 21 papers in top-tier journals. They discovered that LPL is active as a
monomer, dispelling dogma that it is a homodimer; solved the atomic structure of the GPIHBP1–LPL complex;
elucidated the function of GPIHBP1’s acidic domain; and discovered a new human disease (chylomicronemia
from GPIHBP1 autoantibodies). The latter discovery has saved lives. They are now focusing on longstanding
mysteries in TG metabolism. In Specific Aim 1, they will define the function of apolipoprotein regulators of LPL
activity (APOA5, APOC2). They will build on their discovery that APOA5 deficiency reduces intracapillary LPL
levels and a recent in vitro discovery (by their collaborator Robert Konrad) that APOA5 suppresses the ability of
ANGPTL3/8 to inhibit LPL activity. They will test the ability of recombinant APOA5 to increase intracapillary LPL
levels, and they will define the molecular basis for APOA5–ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3/8–LPL interactions. They
will also build on their discovery that APOC2 stabilizes the conformational integrity of LPL’s hydrolase domain—
even in the presence of ANGPTL4. They will now test whether APOC2 protects LPL from inhibition by ANGPTL3
and ANGPTL3/8, and they will define the impact of APOC2 on LPL’s lid, which regulates substrate entry into
LPL’s catalytic pocket. In Specific Aim 2, they will use stable isotope labeling to study the turnover of GPIHBP1
and LPL in tissues and determine the extent to which LPL turnover is altered by fasting/refeeding and APOA5
deficiency. They will test the hypothesis that GPIHBP1 is a long-lived protein that moves bidirectionally across
ECs and that LPL has a short half-life and largely moves unidirectionally (towards the capillary lumen). In Specific
Aim 3, they will investigate LPL expression in lower vertebrates (where GPIHBP1 is absent) with the goal of
better understanding mammalian LPL biology. They will explore the hypothesis that LPL in lower vertebrates is
produced by capillary ECs (obviating a requirement for GPIHBP1) and that LPL production in capillary ECs has
been retained in mammals. Fong and Ploug are ideally positioned, with outstanding collaborators and unique
tool chests of reagents and experimental methods, to solve each of the three longstanding mysteries in plasma
TG metabolism. They expect that their work will transform textbook descriptions of intravascular lipolysis."

Urine drug testing (UDT) is an integral component of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, and is often required
by payers for patients treated with medications for OUD (MOUD). These regulations exist despite a lack of
evidence-based guidelines. There is no consensus about the optimal UDT frequency, what drugs to test for,
when to use different types of tests (e.g., presumptive versus definitive), and how to adapt care when patients
test positive for non-prescribed substances. Inconsistent practices have important public health and clinical
implications, as they can contribute to either missed opportunities to improve care or to the misallocation of
clinical resources. The goal of this grant is to identify variation in real-world use of UDT that can be modified by
clinical guidelines and policy change, and to examine the patient- and clinician-level factors that influence the
application of UDT, and their relationship with processes of care. Aim 1 will characterize distinct trajectories of
UDT use during episodes of OUD treatment nationally, and across patient characteristics, clinicians, payers,
and states. The sample will comprise continuously enrolled patients with diagnosed OUD from 2015-2022 from
a national, multi-payer database that tracks patients across disparate data systems and includes service claims
data linked to laboratory results. We will examine the correlates of testing frequency and type across different
groups of interest. Aim 2 will identify distinct trajectories of drug positivity during OUD treatment episodes and
identify variation across groups. We will identify the prevalence of patients testing positive for common non-
prescribed drugs (e.g., opioids, cocaine) at the beginning of treatment episodes and the persistence of positivity
in the treatment episode. Using latent class analysis, we will group patients into subtypes related to patterns of
drug positivity (e.g., persistently abstinent, transitioning to abstinence, persistently positive). Aim 3 will estimate
the association between trajectories of UDT use, substance positivity, and process of care measures in the
episode (e.g., retention, MOUD adherence, hospitalization). Using Aims 1-2 variables, we hypothesize that
greater UDT use will not generally lead to changes in process of care outcomes and that patients who are
persistently positive for substances will have worse process of care outcomes. Aim 4 will examine perspectives
of clinicians to identify perceptions and practices related to UDT use. We will survey a national sample of
clinicians treating OUD recruited from a drug testing laboratory. They will be asked about their knowledge,
attitudes, and practices related to testing. From this group, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30
clinicians who vary in their testing practices to learn more about potential opportunities to inform decision-
making surrounding UDT in clinical practice. Overall, this study will characterize the variation in UDT use in real-
world clinical practice and help identify the potential scope for UDT to positively change processes of care for
patients. The findings will lay the foundation for developing pragmatic clinical trials, informing policy decisions,
and refining clinical practice."

Relatively little is known about SMARD1 and CMT2S and the disease-causing gene IGHMBP2 as it relates to
disease development. Therapeutic options are, at best, minimal as no approved drugs exist. The objective of
this project is to understand the consequences of disease-causing mutations in IGHMBP2 that result in SMA
with Respiratory Distress (SMARD1) or Charcot Marie Tooth Type 2S (CMT2S). Towards this goal, we have
generated six Ighmbp2 mouse models that are based on patient mutations in IGHMBP2. These models represent
the first, patient-based models of SMARD1 and CMT2S. Importantly, we demonstrate that each mutation thus
far studied demonstrates distinct disease phenotypes.
 These investigations are designed to further our understanding of IGHMBP2 and its functional significance
in disease development by utilizing the Ighmbp2 mouse models and complementary approaches: genetics and
biochemistry. Aim I of this proposal examines the phenotypic and molecular changes that result from Ighmbp2
mutations R604X and H922Y and the effect of these mutations on disease progression and therapeutic efficacy.
Examining the similarities and differences between these mutations should provide valuable information towards
what molecular alterations result in the more severe SMARD1 or less severe CMT2S. Therapeutic studies
proposed will help us understand what aspects of disease pathology are altered and to what extent. Aim II utilizes
biochemistry to investigate how these IGHMBP2 mutations effect IGHMBP2 function and the association of
proteins in IGHMBP2 pathways. RNA and protein stability, protein binding affinity, ATPase and helicase activity
and processivity for these mutants will be examined in the presence of absence of ABT1, a protein that binds
IGHMBP2 and increases IGHMBP2 ATPase and helicase activity and processivity. It will be important to
determine how each of these mutations alter IGHMBP2 biochemical function and how altered IGHMBP2
biochemical function relates to disease. Our previous studies suggest that IGHMBP2-ABT1 function in 47S pre-
rRNA processing; Aim III expands on these studies. Our laboratory has developed reagents aimed at addressing
IGHMBP2-ABT1 function in neuronal and non-neuronal contexts. 47S pre-rRNA processing will be examined in
wild type and mutant contexts to determine whether and to what extent processing is altered. We will also ask
whether any processing defects can be eliminated following therapeutic delivery of IGHMBP2 or ABT1.
 Each Aim of this proposal should provide independent relevant information towards understanding disease
development and progression, IGHMBP2 biological processes and targets for therapeutic development.
Determining the functional differences between IGHMBP2 mutations that result in SMARD1 versus CMT2S has
important therapeutic implications since a subtle increase in functionality can have profound clinical implications.
 This proposal is a natural collaboration of MU investigators within molecular biology and neurodegenerative
fields. Each investigator provides their own unique expertise towards the successful completion of these Aims."

 The regulation of luminal surveillance and antigen sampling across mucosal surfaces remains an important
and fundamental area of investigation. This is particularly true for the intestinal epithelium, which is constantly
challenged to maintain homoeostasis with the complex microbiome while protecting the mucosa from pathogenic
organisms. Microfold (M) cells of the Peyer’s patch (PP) play a crucial role in immune surveillance of the gut
environment by transporting luminal antigens to underlying immune cells. Through their ability to move cargo
across the epithelium, M cells can (1) benefit the host by translocating luminal contents (e.g. dietary antigens,
microbes, vaccines) to induce appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses or (2) harm the host upon
infection by invasive pathogens. However, the mechanisms responsible for antigen uptake by M cells and
delivery to immune cells are not completely understood in humans. The significance of our proposed research
is that we will define the basic mechanism responsible for the major function (i.e. transcytosis) of human M cells.
Revealing what controls transcytosis in human M cells has the potential to improve our understanding of how
luminal gut contents are delivered to immune cells under normal conditions or during enteric infections. Our
recent discoveries using human enteroids enriched in M cells as a relevant ex vivo model of the human PP
epithelium demonstrate that (1) coronin 1a is required for uptake and transcytosis of luminal cargo across human
M cells, (2) update and transcytosis of gut antigens occurs by a apical-dependent bulk endocytosis process that
involves coronin 1a-mediated signaling, and (3) PP macrophages synergize with M cell-expressing human
enteroids to increase M cell-dependent uptake and transcytosis of luminal gut. SPECIFIC AIMS: We propose
to test the hypotheses that human M cell expressing enteroids respond to luminal microbial and serosal
immune signals to induce uptake and transcytosis of gut cargo by a unique coronin 1a dependent
mechanism. Our central hypotheses are that coronin 1a expression in human M cells is necessary for: (i)
terminal differentiation of FAE progenitor cells to become functionally mature M cells, (ii) synergism between PP
macrophages and the human FAE to enhance luminal sampling of gut antigens, and (iii) mediating luminal- and
serosal-derived signals that stimulate entry and transcytosis of luminal gut cargo to underlying immune cells.
The studies will improve our understanding of how human M cells function and may lead to development of novel
therapeutic strategies to treat GI disorders, such as Crohn’s disease, or even possibly development of new
strategies to enhance oral vaccine delivery."

The obesity epidemic contributes to the increased health burden of chronic inflammatory conditions, including
insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), fatty liver, and cardiovascular disease. New strategies for
prevention and treatment are crucial to improve the quality of life for people with obesity and T2DM, especially
given that behavioral and lifestyle modifications are ineffective alternatives for most of the affected population.
Our long-term objective is to identify safe treatments for obesity and T2DM that can restore the normal endocrine
functions of insulin-resistant fat cells. Working towards this objective, we found the FDA-approved rheumatoid
arthritis drug auranofin generates anti-diabetic effects. We have robust preliminary data showing auranofin
accumulation in WAT reduces leptin abundance in the serum and generates whole-body insulin sensitivity in
obese wild-type mice. Surprisingly, elevated leptin levels and blunted beta-adrenergic receptor activity achieved
by leptin receptor deletion abolished the anti-diabetic effects of auranofin. This application will build upon our
preliminary data and test the hypothesis that impacts of auranofin accumulation in WAT restore beta-adrenergic
receptor competence to limit leptin production and benefit systemic metabolism in obesity. The overall goal of
this application is to explore how auranofin influences insulin sensitivity in preclinical models of obesity with the
expectation that its effects require the vital endocrine hormone leptin. To achieve our overall goal and test the
central hypothesis of the proposal, we propose three specific aims. First, we will demonstrate how the leptin
receptor in WAT influences the metabolic impacts of auranofin. Second, we will establish the serum leptin
decrement required for the anti-diabetic effects of auranofin. Lastly, we will determine the functional role of
adipocyte-intrinsic beta-adrenergic receptors that govern the energy balance impacts of auranofin. Ultimately,
such knowledge will teach us how to leverage the endocrine functions of WAT to treat obesity and its co-
morbidities. Completion of this proposal will tell us how to leverage new pathways that generate metabolic
benefits in preclinical models of obesity and potentially allow people accessible therapeutic options to manage
insulin resistance and T2DM."

 Half of U.S. adults are insufficiently physically active despite the known health benefits. Theory-based
physical activity interventions can facilitate short-term increases in physical activity; yet, little progress has
been made in achieving long-term maintenance of these improvements. Epidemiological evidence has shown
a positive link between social support from existing social ties and regularly engaging in physical activity;
however, experimental evidence focused on these relationships remains equivocal perhaps because most
interventions do not involve one’s existing social ties in the behavior change process or fail to use effective
strategies for harnessing the social environment. Recent calls within healthcare and the scientific community
have been made to identify effective strategies for mobilizing existing social relationships for lasting physical
activity increases. We propose to test the effect of digitally delivered social support training for promoting
sustained moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) increases, using a cluster randomized controlled trial.
Self-selected teams of 3-8 insufficiently active adults (about 60 teams comprised of a total of N=300
participants) will be randomized to receive either a 3-month theory-based technology-delivered physical activity
intervention (mobile-compatible web app with behavior change content, Fitbit physical activity tracker, tailored
goals, and feedback; Team) or the same intervention plus digitally delivered social support training
(Team+Training). Teams randomized to receive social support training will be provided with a series of online
interactive training modules that highlight methods of providing social support in an autonomous way (non-
judgmental, empathetic, refraining from control). They will also be provided with an online crowdsourcing
communication tool where they can communicate with intervention staff and their peers about challenges and
solutions regarding the exchange of social support for physical activity, as well as team skills-building feedback
to reinforce the knowledge and skills acquired via the modules. The specific aims are:
 Aim 1: To test the effect of Team+Training versus Team among self-selected teams of insufficiently active
 adults (N=300; 40% minority) on changes in MVPA measured by accelerometry at 3 months.
 Aim 2: To compare the effect of Team+Training versus Team on changes in key psychosocial constructs
 (social support; autonomy support; motivation; accountability) at 3- and 12-months.
 Aim 3: To assess MVPA change measured by accelerometry at 12 months in Team+Training versus Team.
 Aim 4: To explore whether social support mediates increased and sustained MVPA within the overall
sample.
 The proposed research will advance public health efforts to improve metabolic and cardiovascular
health by providing evidence on a novel and promising strategy to leverage existing social relationships for
sustained physical activity behavior."

Candidate: This K01 is submitted by Dr. del Pino, Associate Professor, from Charles R. Drew University of
Medicine and Science (CDU). This proposal is the next step in his transition from philosophy to public health
research. He seeks to reduce HIV disparities among Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) by analyzing
family support data from three prospective cohort studies in Los Angeles and Chicago and by conducting
formative research to leverage the siblings of Latino MSM in an HIV biomedical prevention intervention. He has
published qualitative and quantitative papers on family support, substance use, and HIV. He is currently
supported by the CDU Emerging Scholars Award and CRECD.
Career Development and Training Plan: Dr. del Pino's mentoring team includes Dr. Steve Shoptaw (expert
in substance use and biomedical interventions), Dr. Nina Harawa (expert in the development of culturally
responsive HIV-prevention interventions for MSM of color), and Dr. Arun Karlamangla (expert in complex
biostatistical data analysis and longitudinal clinical epidemiology research). The training goals (advanced
biostatistics, families and stigma, and intervention development) will be achieved through coursework and
individual tutorials with each mentor. He will have access to the UCLA CTSI (NCATS); UCLA CHIPTS (NIMH);
and to AXIS, CDU's center for clinical and translational research resources and trainings (NIMHD).
Research Plan: Despite the prevention and treatment efforts of the past 30 years, Latino MSM continue to be
disproportionately impacted by HIV. Yet a powerful cultural source of motivation has been underutilized: the
family. This project seeks to address HIV disparities by addressing gaps in our knowledge of (a) how family
support affects the behaviors and health of Latino MSM over time and (b) how to engage siblings in the
development and delivery of PrEP-use messages.
Aim 1: Determine how family support and mental health affect the HIV-related behaviors (e.g., substance use,
sexual risk) and HIV-related health (e.g., STI, HIV viral load) of Latino MSM over time. Hypothesis: Latino MSM
with greater family support over time will report better HIV-related risk behaviors and health outcomes than
Latino MSM who report little to no family support. Aim 2: Identify barriers and facilitators to engaging Latino
MSM and siblings in HIV biomedical interventions. Aim 3: Develop and pilot test sibling-delivered messages to
increase PrEP use in high-risk Latino MSM to gather feasibility and acceptability data and to refine the
intervention processes and messages.
Summary: The Career Development and Training Plan and the Research Plan will prepare Dr. del Pino to
submit an R01 to test the efficacy and effectiveness of a culturally-specific, sibling-based intervention to reduce
HIV disparities among Latino MSM. His mentorship team has the required expertise and established record of
mentoring junior researchers to ensure that he becomes an independently-funded investigator."

The ultimate goal of this F31 Ruth L. Kirchstein NRSA is to request support to address a fundamental gap in
knowledge preventing engineering of efficacious drug delivery vehicles for progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS).
PMS is a common, debilitating neurodegenerative disease that causes widespread demyelination in the central
nervous system. There are currently no therapies that reliably remediate the advance of PMS, but an emerging
strategy is to promote recovery by initiating differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to
oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells depleted in PMS. Current drug delivery techniques to achieve
remyelination are either poorly efficacious or highly invasive, major impediments to clinical translation.
An effective remyelinating therapeutic for PMS must cross the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and then target
OPCs. This proposal focuses on the synthesis and testing of engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) as a drug
delivery vehicle to accomplish these feats. Natural EVs have been shown to both target specific cells/tissues
and also cross endothelial barriers. However, due to their immense functional heterogeneity, these qualities do
not occur in the same EVs. Although a population of EVs that efficiently targets OPC has been identified, the
best EV population and key proteins that promote BBB crossing remain unknown, preventing new biomimetic
engineering strategies. To address the limitations of current therapeutics, I propose to identify and fuse
subpopulations of EVs that efficiently cross the BBB and target OPCs, load them with microRNA-219, an OPC
differentiating agent, to engineer a bioavailable and selective drug delivery vehicle.
Building on results obtained in my preliminary data, I will carry out this project in three steps: (1) to optimize a
method of fluorescence activated vesicle sorting to identify and isolate BBB-crossing EVs; (2) to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms and key proteins during BBB transcytosis using a functional transwell model; and (3) to
produce eEVs via fusion of endogenous EVs and loading with remyelinating therapeutics. We will quantify eEV
ability to cross the BBB and target OPCs to initiate differentiation and produce myelin in vitro and in vivo. This
project is focused on producing a novel therapeutic uniquely suited to PMS, but this pipeline to engineer EVs
with multiple targeted functions could be applied to address drug delivery barriers for many medical problems.
This project was developed in parallel with a rigorous training plan to enhance my training and technical skills in
the areas of neurology, pharmacology, and translational medicine. This plan will enable my transition to
independence as I focus on my long-term goal of pursuing an academic career developing neurological
therapeutics. Training will exploit the university’s many resources for professional and educational development."
10747409,"Project Summary:
There are now 8 FDA-approved antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) on the market. ADC technology is being widely
pursued for oncology, autoimmunity, ophthalmology, and infectious disease applications. In spite of tremendous
success, however, the ADC development process is riddled with challenges associated with ADC aggregation, linker-
stability concerns, unexpected toxicity, and poor pharmacokinetics. While it is impossible to lay the blame for this at
the feet of a single phenomenon, one common factor shared by the vast majority of ADCs is the reliance on a
hydrophobic peptide linker (i.e. ValCit-PABC) that is stable in plasma but rapidly cleaved by lysosomal cathepsins.
Various studies have recently shown that this linker is more unstable in circulation was than previously believed, being
susceptible to cleavage by both plasma esterases (Ces1C) and lymphocyte-associated proteases (neutrophil elastase).
It is now widely believed that cleavage by neutrophil elastase is responsible for the dose-limiting neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia so commonly seen for many ADCs. A new generation of cleavable linkers is urgently needed in order
to overcome these liabilities. Herein, we propose the optimization and evaluation of “redesigned” ADC linkers that
contain asparagine (Asn) motifs which are rapidly cleaved by asparaginyl endoprotease, also known as legumain. Our
team has identified several Asn-containing sequences that are rapidly cleaved by lysosomal legumain while retaining
stability in mouse and human plasma. Our preliminary data shows that ADCs that incorporate these linkers exhibit
comparable in vitro cytotoxicity to classical ValCit-PABC linkers – but are not susceptible to cleavable by Ces1C or
neutrophil elastase. We have designed three specific aims to optimize this linker and to demonstrate that model ADCs
that use these linkers have improved therapeutic potential as compared to traditional ValCit-PABC linkers. Aim #1 is
is focused on the optimization of the peptide linker itself. We will prepare a FRET-based library of Asn-containing
peptides in order to identify robust linkers that can be incorporated into various cancer-targeting ADCs. Aim #2 is
focused on the development of suitable self-immolative spacers for the legumain cleavable peptides. The spacer will
be optimized in order to facilitate rapid cleavage in the lysosome and high stability in plasma. Aim #3 will establish
the therapeutic utility of legumain-cleavable ADCs in a model of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, we will incorporate
our novel linkers into anti-GCC ADCs that are of interest for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The ADCs will be
compared head-to-head with a traditional ADC (TAK-264) that failed phase 2 clinical trials due to dose limiting
neutropenia. We anticipate that our novel linkers will impart an improved tolerability to this ADC while maintaining the
efficacy. Accomplishment of these aims will firmly establish the suitability of legumain-cleavage for therapeutic
applications – and will poise the technology for clinical application. Development of novel pancreatic-cancer targeting
ADCs will pave the way towards clinical evaluation in an area of tremendous unmet medical need."
10747410,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The human trypsin isoforms, trypsin 1, trypsin 2, and mesotrypsin, are proteases that have been implicated in
disease processes in cancer and pancreatitis, and may offer viable therapeutic targets. Trypsins belong to a
large family of trypsin-like enzymes with similar active site topology, and hence existing inhibitors lack
selectivity. There is a need for selective trypsin inhibitors and isoform-selective trypsin inhibitors as
pharmacological tools to better define the functions of these individual enzymes in disease, and to evaluate
trypsin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in preclinical models of disease. In this project, we will take a
multipronged approach to develop new strategies for potent and selective inhibition of each of the human
trypsin isoforms. (1) Our preliminary data reveal a previously unsuspected auto-inhibited conformation of
mesotrypsin with a ligand-targetable allosteric site that may be exploited for inhibitory effect. We will use high-
throughput virtual screening and structure-based hit-to-lead optimization to develop potent and selective
allosteric inhibitors of mesotrypsin. We will also use structural and molecular dynamics analyses to evaluate
whether similar strategies may hold potential for trypsins 1 and 2. (2) Our published studies have shown that
Kunitz domains can be engineered to create more selective protein-based inhibitors of trypsin-like proteases
by using a yeast surface display (YSD) platform for directed evolution. To enable further optimization of such
inhibitors, we seek to generate comprehensive maps of the binding specificity landscapes that can, for any
possible combination of mutations within an inhibitor, predict the consequences on inhibitor affinity and
specificity toward a set of target proteases. We will accomplish this task by integrating YSD combinatorial
library screening with next-generation sequencing (NGS), machine-learning (ML) approaches, and
experimental calibration to enable quantitative prediction of the impact of multiple potentially interacting
mutations of an inhibitor. These data will enable us to identify the most potent and selective Kunitz domains
that can be achieved for targeting each of the human trypsins. (3) Our preliminary data demonstrate an
enhancement of trypsin affinity by bivalent inhibitors capable of binding simultaneously to two molecules of
mesotrypsin. Here, we will dissect the mechanisms responsible for these affinity enhancements and design
strategies to exploit this information toward development of more potent and selective polyvalent trypsin
inhibitors. In addition to developing three complementary strategies, each of which has high potential to
produce the desired selective inhibitors of human trypsins, our project will provide broader insights that can aid
future development of inhibitors for many other important trypsin-like proteases. Finally, the novel methodology
developed here for mapping protein-protein interaction (PPI) affinity and specificity landscapes will be of broad
utility for characterizing the sequence and structural constraints governing affinity and selectivity of functional
protein interactions in many other diverse systems."
10780194,"Myeloid ACAT1 in Ischemic Retinopathy
Studies in the mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) have shown
that myeloid cell-induced angiogenesis has a critical role in pathological retinal neovascularization (RNV) and
retinal neurovascular dysfunction/injury, but the mechanisms are not yet known. We propose to investigate
myeloid cell expression/activity of the cholesterol metabolizing enzyme ACAT (acyl-Coenzyme A: cholesterol
acyltransferase, also known as sterol O-acyltranserase) as a novel therapeutic target for ischemic retinopathy.
There are two isoforms of ACAT: ACAT1 and ACAT2. ACAT1 is widely expressed and its upregulation in
macrophages and microglia has been implicated in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively.
ACAT2 is mainly expressed in the intestines and liver. We will focus on ACAT1 in this project. During
ischemia/hypoxia, microglia/macrophages are exposed to increased levels of oxidized low density lipoprotein
cholesterol (oxLDLc). Its internalization by the LDL receptor (LDLR) increases activity of ACAT1, which esterifies
cholesterol to form cholesterol esters (CE). Increases in CE promote an inflammatory microglia/macrophage
phenotype characterized by increased expression of the amplifier of inflammatory signaling TREM-1 (triggering
receptor expressed in myeloid cells-1), MCSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor), VEGF and TNFα. Our
studies in the mouse model of OIR show marked increases in lipid accumulation, LDLR expression and CE
formation in areas of RNV suggesting that dyslipidemia and ACAT activity play a key role in RNV. Furthermore,
LDLR deletion or ACAT inhibition prevented RNV and decreased expression of TREM-1 and MCSF. Our studies
in DR mice show similar signs of dyslipidemia and ACAT1 activation associated with DR-induced retinal
inflammation and neurovascular injury. Moreover, hypoxia treatment of microglia/macrophages in vitro
significantly increased their expression of TREM-1 and MCSF. Based on these results our central hypothesis is
that ischemia-induced activation of ACAT1 drives retinal inflammation and promotes neurovascular
injury during OIR and DR. Our aims will test this hypothesis by determining whether 1) ACAT1-mediated
activation of Mg/MΦ cells is critically involved in OIR-induced RNV and neuroglial injury/dysfunction, 2) DR-
induced ACAT1 activation in Mg/MΦ cells promotes retinal neurovascular injury/dysfunction."

optometry grade point averages of the applicants was 3.6 and the average undergraduate and optometry
grade point averages of the participants was 3.7, our faculty paid for four additional students from their own
funds to participate in the T35 program, and we denied 13 students with a 3.7 or higher optometry grade point
average and five students with a 4.0 optometry grade point average. Furthermore, since the first year of T35
funding in 1998, T35 students have co-authored 215 scientific abstracts and 59 peer-reviewed publications, all
150 funded positions have been filled, we self-funded 14 additional positions (including 12 since 2014), 82/142
(58%) who graduated with an optometry degree also graduated with Master's degrees, 5/142 (4%) received
PhD degrees, and 4/142 (3%) are currently in PhD programs. The quality and quantity of the students are very
high, and the faculty are very supportive of the T35 program. We routinely support more students than are
funded, so we request an increase from six to eight T35 students funded per year.
 The goal of the training program is to encourage professional students to enroll in the Combined OD/MS
program during which optometry students earn both an OD and a Master's degree in four years and to embark
on a career in eye research. Despite the fact that most students entering the T35 program want to pursue
clinical careers, this program has been excellent at motivating students to earn Master's and/or PhD degrees
through participation in vision research in mentors' laboratories, a journal club, vision science seminars,
research ethics training, and informal discussions ranging from enrolling in the graduate program to reference
managers.
 The training is conducted primarily in the laboratories of 24 established eye and vision researchers (six per
year) who are primarily members of the College of Optometry but with representation from the Neuroscience,
Biomedical Engineering, and Ophthalmology. The mentors' specific areas of research include, but are certainly
not limited to refractive error, ocular embryonic development, color perception, pediatrics, cataractogenesis,
vision rehabilitation, retinal detachments, adaptive optics, and corneoscleral biomechanics. Increased support
of the OSU College of Optometry T35 program will contribute to the scientific literature and engage future
independent clinician scientists who perform vision research."
10929471,"PROJECT SUMMARY
New experiences elicit distinct patterns of brain activity, leading to the changes in gene expression, neuronal
properties, and connectivity that underlie brain plasticity. In humans, the period of enhanced plasticity during
brain development is particularly protracted compared to other species. However, the mechanisms and extent
to which human neurons have changed to support increased plasticity remain unknown. Furthermore, although
prolonged developmental plasticity may support increased cognitive capabilities and behavioral flexibility, it may
also increase vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuronal plasticity depends on activity-regulated
changes in gene expression that are controlled by activity-responsive genomic regulatory elements. Although
we and others have identified regulatory elements as prominent substrates of human-specific evolutionary
change, recent atlases of postmortem human and non-human primate brains overlook such dynamic stimulus-
responsive regulatory elements. Without training on context-dependent data, current computational models that
infer regulatory function based on sequence fail to predict activity-dependent regulatory elements. We
hypothesize that there have been genetic changes in human divergent activity-regulated elements (hDAREs)
and that we can discover these human-specific genetic underpinnings of plasticity using genome-wide
approaches. We will use experimental and computational methods to predict and compare the activity-regulated
responses of human neurons versus neurons from rhesus macaque and chimpanzee. We have developed
innovative model systems that will allow us to stimulate physiological activity states in previously inaccessible
primate neurons, machine learning models to predict regulatory function based on sequence, and massively
parallel reporter assays and CRISPRi assays that will allow us to assess the function of candidate hDAREs.
Through the successful completion of these studies, we will determine which genomic elements and genetic
changes underlie activity-dependent responses in human neurons and the extent to which changes in these
elements represent a major substrate of evolutionary selection in the human lineage. This will lay the groundwork
for further phenotypic characterization of cellular plasticity mechanisms in the developing human brain.
Additionally, these datasets will provide a valuable resource for dissecting genetic mechanisms of
neurodevelopmental disorders."

Project 3 is designed to determine the roles of class I and II histone deacetylase (HDAC I/II),

cancer cell pathways and the recruitment of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells
(macrophages in the liver) to constitute a microenvironment for enhancing the growth of the

observations in metastasis promotion using a new chemical entity we designed to inhibit HDAC
I/II and GSK-3β, two key enzymes that are overactivated in pancreatic, prostate and colorectal
cancer. Further, our preliminary shows roles for HDAC I/II and GSK-3β in regulating YAP, MSP,
RON and metastasis.
Based on preliminary results, we propose the following specific aims: (1) to investigate the
mechanisms by which HDAC and GSK-3β regulate YAP signaling in cancer cells to promote the
growth of metastasis in the liver; and (2) to investigate the regulation and role of YAP signaling in
HSCs for remodeling of cancer microenvironment in the liver to promote the growth of liver
metastasis. In collaboration with other projects of this Program, Project 3 will study the roles of
YAP and MSP/RON signaling in pancreatic, colon, and prostate cancers and determine the
relationship of these signals with fatty liver and high fat diet. The outcomes of this project will
significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the promotion of cancer
metastasis to the liver, with clear insights for application of the knowledge to the prevention and
treatment of cancer metastasis."
10783699,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MOLECULAR MEDICINE PROGRAM
The overarching goal of the Molecular Medicine (MM) Program is to integrate systems biology, drug discovery,
and precision medicine approaches to develop, validate and deliver new therapeutic strategies and agents, and
to drive landmark trials that improve standard-of-care for patients in our catchment area and beyond. Key
priorities of MM are to: 1) identify and validate key effectors and biomarkers of circuits that drive cancer
progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance; 2) develop new molecular probes that will facilitate mechanistic
understanding of the roles of priority targets in tumorigenesis; 3) optimize drug-like properties of targeted agents
through medicinal chemistry, for testing in clinical trials; and 4) conduct impactful clinical trials that lead to
changes in standard of care. To accomplish these goals, MM research is organized into three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To identify and validate pathways and targets of cancer metastases and therapy resistance.
Aim 2: To define mechanisms of action and optimize existing drugs and lead compounds.
Aim 3: To design and implement therapeutic trials with a precision medicine approach.
MM is comprised of 55 basic and clinical researchers who have formed multidisciplinary teams that create unique
opportunities for translational research focused on bench-to-bedside medicine. Further, in a feed-forward
fashion, findings coming from clinical trials inform important new research at the bench, to refine strategies and
targeted agents, and to develop predictive biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis, and response. This robust cyclic
pipeline of research and trials has been driven by the recruitment of twelve new Members to the MM Program,
which has a healthy balance of 15 Assistant, 15 Associate, and 25 Senior Members, as well as by investments
in key target areas that address the Specific Aims and key catchment area priorities identified by Moffitt’s Office
of Community Outreach, Engagement, and Equity. The MM Program currently holds $35.2 M in total funding,
including $8.9M in peer-reviewed funding and $26.3M in non-peer-reviewed funding. MM members published
1,302 articles, with 323 (25%) intra-programmatic publications, 412 (32%) inter-programmatic publications, and
with 272 high impact articles (impact factor >10). Importantly, MM accrued 3,926 patients to interventional clinical
trials, including 2,333 to investigator-initiated trials. Notably, MM research on melanoma, lung cancer, and
cancers in elderly patients have made a significant impact on the cancer burden and at-risk populations in our
catchment area and, importantly, MM clinical trials have resulted in FDA approvals and changes in National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Future priorities of the MM Program are to: 1) combine
unbiased cell-based phenotypic screening with chemistry and proteomics to simultaneously identify target and
chemical leads; 2) fully integrate bulk and single cell ‘omics analyses to inform mechanisms and targets; 3) apply
machine learning to fuel precision medicine; 4) recruit physician scientists to support SPORE and P01 initiatives;
and 5) expand novel treatments in the catchment area among priority populations."
10786037,"National studies show that drug use rates have increased in the last decade among women, comprising a
major public health concern in the US. However, women are greatly underrepresented in neuroimaging
studies, and the paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations contributes to
a gap in the study of the sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Over the last
decade, in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (conducted with previous support including
R01DA023579, R01DA020949), we have thoroughly mapped the clinical symptoms of cocaine addiction to the
neural networks underlying impairments in Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA). This model
proposes that the drug assumes heightened salience at the expense of non-drug related reinforcement as
associated with abnormalities in reward processing and concomitant decreases in inhibitory control, together
increasing addiction severity (including craving, a proxy of relapse) in susceptible individuals. The iRISA model
highlights the role of the dopaminergically innervated prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to mesolimbic
and striatal subcortical regions as assessed functionally and structurally. However, the majority of this
neuroimaging research has been accomplished in male individuals with cocaine use disorders (iCUD). In the
current project we aim to expand the reach of iRISA by comparing equal numbers of male to female iCUD; to
test this model’s generalizability (vs. drug specificity effects), we will also include individuals with opioid use
disorder (iOUD). We will conduct functional MRI during reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity
tasks, and, to inspect generalizability of results beyond task-related activations, during resting-state. Beyond
functional activations and connectivity, anatomical scans will assess the underlying gray matter integrity.
Across all aims, healthy controls will be included to establish norms. We hypothesize female iCUD to differ
from male iCUD, or female controls, in a pattern indicative of enhanced vulnerability to iRISA inclusive of
compensatory PFC activations and abnormalities in structural measures; iCUD vs. iOUD comparisons will be
exploratory. The novelty of this proposal is further enhanced by an exploratory aim to compare, in a within-
subjects design, menstrual cycle (and hormonal) effects and by developing sophisticated machine-learning
algorithms to incorporate data from all imaging modalities to yield an automated group classification and
addiction severity (including craving) prediction tool. Considering that the majority of research in addiction
occurs in males, clarification of the sex differences in the neural underpinnings of iRISA could reinforce the
importance of studying both genders and suggest that different treatment strategies may be effective in women
(potentially of most impact when timed vis-à-vis menstrual cycle), contributing to the development of tailored
(gender-based) treatment options. Including equal numbers of women and men would advance basic studies
of drug addiction and ultimately save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects in future clinical trials."

The Biomarker and Neurogenetics
(BNG) Core builds on the existing strengths of genetics of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers
at the University of Pittsburgh. Over nearly 25 years, we have amassed DNA and plasma samples along with
endophenotype data from approximately 12,000 University of Pittsburgh ADRC (PITT-ADRC) and non-ADRC
participants. This rich resource has enabled our research team to play a significant role in understanding the
complex genetic architecture of late-onset AD and AD-related endophenotypes. The goal of the BNG Core is to
continue collecting and archiving DNA and blood samples from new and existing AD patients and controls in
order to enlarge case-control and endophenotype samples and to augment the amount of existing DNA and
plasma that would be critical to current and future efforts in identifying new genetic markers and plasma
biomarkers for AD in Pittsburgh and at external sites. Specifically, we will collect and bank DNA and plasma
from blood samples and obtain endophenotype data from ADRC and non-ADRC ancillary studies (aim1);
generate APOE and other new genetic risk markers associated with AD and provide the genetic data to
qualified investigators (aim 2); and generate plasma Aβ and neurofilament light (NFL) biomarkers data and
provide this to studies assessing the utility of blood-based biomarkers to predict individual Aβ and tau
deposition, as well as neurodegeneration, as determined by PET and MRI imaging."
10784542,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We continue to lack vaccines for many pathogens of public health importance, including herpes simplex virus-2
(HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and tuberculosis (TB). In many infections of public health
importance including HSV-2, the mucosal barrier is the portal of pathogen exposure, yet the regulation of
mucosal immunity is incompletely understood. The broad objective of this proposal is to achieve a more in-depth
knowledge of the regulation of mucosal immunity in the anti-pathogen immune response. Nature killer (NK) cells
at mucosal sites are critical in controlling infections. NK cells are important for resolving HSV-2 infection by
producing cytokines early after infection that activate adaptive immune responses, such as IFNg. Although NK
cells are part of the innate immune system, there is evidence suggesting that NK cells can become long-lived
memory-like cells and play an important role in secondary immune responses. NK cells remain functionally
primed in the mucosal tissue up to 30 days after HSV-2 infection. During HSV-2 infection, NK cell activation is
driven by inflammatory cytokines, and therefore must be subject to immune regulation to limit immunopathology.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) act by suppressing immunity and are crucial to maintaining peripheral tolerance and
limiting tissue damage from excess inflammation. In the context of infection, there is evidence that Tregs
unexpectedly also play a pivotal role in orchestrating an anti-pathogen response. Tregs are necessary during
early HSV-2 infection to coordinate a productive anti-viral immune response in the vaginal tract (VT) in mice.
However, the mechanism by which Tregs coordinate early antiviral innate immunity while limiting
immunopathology remains poorly defined. While the link between NK cells and Tregs during infection is not well
understood, there is evidence that the NK cell response is altered by the absence of Tregs. We previously
published that Tregs are required for the proper homing of NK cells to the VT after HSV-2 infection. More recently,
I have generated data that Treg depletion during HSV-2 infection increases NK cell maturation providing
evidence that Tregs act in limiting NK cell response during viral infection. Thus, our rigorous prior research
suggests a dual function for Tregs in modulating NK cell responses in which Tregs are required for both
coordination of NK cell response and limiting excessive inflammation. However, the mechanisms and timing by
which Tregs modulate NK cells within mucosal tissues during infection remain to be studied. This proposed work
is essential for understanding the role of Tregs in coordinating and regulating NK cell function in mucosal tissues
during viral infection. This understanding of mucosal immunology will be crucial to informing vaccine strategies
to develop a balanced, robust, and tissue-specific immune response against viral infections, while still limiting
immunopathology."
10784347,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Among the most powerful and successful new therapies to enter the cancer clinic is CAR-T cell therapy. CAR-
T cell therapy has been remarkably effective for patients with certain refractory, progressive hematologic
cancers, resulting in several FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapies. However, this therapy has not been
successful for solid cancers, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), reflecting the need for suitable antigen targets
for each disease, as well as patient, tumor, and immune factors, especially poor infiltration of solid tumors by
CAR-T cells. The development of cellular therapies that can be applied to CRC without toxicity would have a
remarkable impact on the landscape of solid cancer therapy.
Here, we test the hypothesis that CAR-T cells can be engineered to home to CRC tumors by leveraging their
endogenous chemokine milieus, increasing antitumor efficacy over conventional CAR-T cells. We have
identified a chemokine + chemokine receptor axis that maintains an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) in CRCs. Using validated human CRC models and target antigen, we will engineer
CAR-T cells to express the chemokine receptor directed at this CRC chemokine and explore the safety and
efficacy of this approach in mouse models. Aim 1 will define the tumor homing and efficacy of chemokine
receptor-engineered CAR-T cells in vitro and in vivo using human CRC cell lines. Aim 2 will define the safety
impact in mice because this approach may increase homing of CAR-T cells to not only tumors but also normal
tissues, resulting in toxicity. Together, these studies will produce the necessary proof-of-concept data to
develop this therapeutic approach for translation to clinical trials in patients with advanced/metastatic CRC."
10788384,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) represent a family of cell surface receptors. Both of insulin
receptor (IR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) are type II RTKs that play
essential roles in controlling glucose metabolism, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and
migration. Aberrant IR or IGF1R signaling causes a number of human diseases, including
diabetes and cancers, which makes them promising therapeutic targets. Despite the functional
importance and strong connections with diseases, the exact ligand induced activation mechanism
of IR and IGF1R are still unknown, due to the lack of high resolution structures of full-length
receptors/ligands complex. The goal of this project is to reveal how ligands (insulin and IGF1,
respectively) binds to these two different types of receptors and how ligand binding leads to the
receptor activation. Although both the IR and IGF1R share high sequence identity and structural
similarity, they have been shown to exhibit great diversification in the ligand binding properties,
which is indicative of diverse activation mechanism. Consistently, our preliminary structural work
showed that the fully liganded IR dimer is bound by 4 insulin molecules at two distinct types of
sites—the well-known site 1 and our newly discovered site 2; whereas, only one IGF1 molecule
binds the asymmetric IGF1R dimer, meaning that the binding of IGF1 to IGF1R involves negative
cooperativity. We will combine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biophysical, biochemical and
cellular based approaches to understand the roles of site 1 and 2 insulin binding for IR activation,
explain the origin of the negative cooperativity in the binding of IGF1 to IGF1R, and reveal the
function of transmembrane domains (TM) of IR and IGF1R in receptor activation. Aim 1 will be
focused on the functional and structural analyses of full-length IR in the active state. These studies
will reveal the detailed binding mode between insulin and the novel IR site 2, and identify the
critical role of each type of insulin binding. In addition, we will test whether IRs with different
number of insulins bound exhibit different levels of activities and trigger distinct downstream
signaling. Aim 2 will be focused on biochemical and structural analyses of full-length IGF1R in the
active state. We will identify the structural requirements for the negative cooperative binding of
IGF1 to IGF1R, and explain the functional importance of the negative cooperative for IGF1R
activation. Aim 3 will be focused on the direct visualization of the TM-TM interaction in the active
state of IR and IGF1R to understand why the TM dimerization in the active state of IR and IGF1R
is important for receptor activation."
10759380,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 My laboratory is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cell adhesion and
motility mediated by integrins and related small GTPases, and applying these findings to the development of
new class of inhibitors for potential therapeutic benefits. Integrins are cell adhesion molecules that transduce
signals across the plasma membrane in both directions. Thrombotic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, T cell
proliferation defects, and many autoimmune diseases have been linked to the misregulation of integrin
expression and its activity. The major gaps in the field of integrin and related signaling pathways include
inaccurate molecular models of signaling events mediated by the integrin activator, a lack of understanding to
the regulation of different integrin species, unknown mechanism underlying the peculiar dual GTPase specificity
of their effector protein, and a lack of inhibitors targeting intracellular adaptors.
 We have obtained substantial preliminary data to bridge this gaps. The main goals of the lab for the next
five years are to investigate the signaling mechanisms of the adaptors and integrins, focusing on the connection
of isoforms and posttranslational modifications with specific integrin species and related GTPases, and to
develop a new class of adaptor protein inhibitors to control integrin functions. The proposed studies include both
basic research and translational research, which reflect an ever-expanding scope of the research in our research
program. Our vigorous efforts would undoubtedly support us to achieve the overall goal of conquering integrin
related diseases by more effective therapeutic interventions."
10759411,"Summary, Administrative Core
The proposal “Thalamus in the middle: computations in multi-regional neural circuits” aims to combine expertise
in theory, molecular neuroscience, modern high-throughput anatomy, cellular and synaptic neurophysiology, and
large-scale neurophysiology in the context of quantitative behavior. The overall project consists of five Projects,
focusing on how information flows from subcortical areas, through thalamus, to control cortical activity modes
and thereby shape behavior; a Molecular Science Core, a Data Science Core, and an Administrative Core with
5 PIs and two collaborative sites. Realizing the potential of this project requires strong administrative leadership
to integrate and synergize efforts across the collaborating researchers at New York University and the Allen
Institute.
The Administrative Core will provide the structure, leadership and operational management of the overall project
to advance the goal of understanding neural computation in subcortex → thalamus → cortex circuits. This will
include project management, strategic planning, progress reporting, fiscal management, and support for
collaboration and communication. The Administrative Core will create an infrastructure that fosters
communication and collaboration among the members, as well as garnering input from the external research
community through the formation of an External Scientific Advisory Board. The overall project will form a Steering
Committee and Project Teams to oversee the collaborative, standardized, and on-time data generation, data
analysis, and public data sharing process. Project management best practices, such as milestones, progress
reporting and tracking, collaborative software programs, and a responsibility matrix will be applied to ensure
achievement of performance objectives and milestones, optimized communication, and resource utilization and
prioritization. In addition, the Administrative Core will foster joint data analysis efforts across projects and
Institutions. To produce a high-quality tools and data resource, rigorous standardization and quality control
practices will be adopted by all members. Finally, the Administrative Core will implement and maintain fiscal and
subcontractor management processes for all members, manage publication and authorship decisions and
conflict resolution. With the implementation of this entire infrastructure, we anticipate that this project and the
resources it produces will have a broad and meaningful impact on uncovering the logic of signal routing from
subcortical areas to the frontal cortex thalamus."
10759412,"Summary, Data Science Core
The Data Science Core (DSC) serves multiple purposes related to moving, storing, analyzing, and sharing data.
The data sets collected by this collaboration will be very large (PB scale) and multi-modal, including: Brain-wide,
mesoscale anatomy (Project 1-4); spatial transcriptomics (Project 2, Molecular Science Core); large-scale in vivo
electrophysiology (Project 3, 4); brain slice synaptic physiology and voltage imaging (Project 3); behavior (Project
4); large-scale simulations of neural circuits (Project 5). Implementing algorithms to extract knowledge from these
large-scale and complex data sets demands professional data science and software practices. The DSC will
configure the infrastructure to efficiently share data and analysis pipelines in the cloud. Individual research
projects also require support for implementing data analysis algorithms and related software engineering. The
DSC will implement and refine analysis algorithms so that these can be applied to data at scale. In addition to
discoveries, research papers, and reagents, data itself is a major product of our proposed research. This team
is not only committed to open science but has a history of delivering. Anatomical, molecular, neurophysiological
and behavioral data will be made available in widely-used repositories in standardized data formats. The DSC
will support the sharing of data within the team and with the scientific community at large.
The thalamus is a collection of nuclei that has been traditionally segmented using low-dimensional information,
including cytoarchitecture and single-channel immunohistochemistry. The existing segmentations (i.e.
anatomical atlases) are not sufficient to describe the rich functional architecture of the thalamus. We therefore
need to register all measurements precisely to thalamic sub-regions, agnostic to current notions of intra-thalamic
boundaries. A major task for the DSC is to register anatomical (Project 1, 2), molecular (Project 2, MSC) and
neurophysiological measurements (Projects 3, 4) at the highest possible resolution to a standardized reference
atlas (the Allen Common Coordinate Framework, CCF). Localization of all measurements within the thalamus is
an important step in discovering the architecture and functional logic of the thalamus. The DSC will implement
efficient and accurate workflows for spatial alignment of all data in the CCF.
The DSC will subscribe to the following principles: i) implement best practices with respect to FAIR (Findable,
Accurate, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles; ii) reuse and extend community data standards; iii) rely on
existing data repositories as available; and iv) reuse and build on existing open source software ecosystems."
10759414,"Summary, Molecular Science Core
The thalamus contains excitatory neurons that receive input from diverse areas outside of the thalamus
(neocortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, midbrain, hippocampus) and project to the neocortex. Recent molecular
mapping and morphological reconstructions have shown that these thalamocortical (TC) cells are much more
diverse than previously thought, both across and within cytoarchitectonically-defined thalamic nuclei. Different
TC cells likely receive input from different subcortical structures, and project to different cortical areas and layers.
Experimental access to specific TC cell types is essential for elucidating their roles in neural circuit function.
Single cell genomics has recently enabled unprecedented definition of cell types at the molecular level and has
uncovered numerous marker genes and putative regulatory elements, which can be used to generate genetic
tools for access to specific cell populations.
For the adult mouse thalamus, we have generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomics dataset (scRNA-seq)
to measure gene expression, and a matching single-nucleus chromatin accessibility dataset (snATAC-seq) to
discover putative enhancers. In addition, we are in the process of generating equivalent data for the developing
mouse thalamus. These datasets will enable us to select marker genes and enhancers to generate transgenic
and viral tools for genetic access to TC types. To refine access to specific TC types, intersectional genetic
approaches combining viruses, transgenes, and retrograde labeling will be explored. We will evaluate the
completeness of labeling a specific cell population versus specificity at the level of the whole brain, as different
levels of specificity / completeness are needed for different experimental purposes. Sparse yet specific labeling
is ideal for morphological examination, whereas relatively complete and locally or globally specific labeling is
needed for behavioral perturbations.
The tools will be used in other research segments (Projects 2, 3, 4) as soon as they become available. Tool
characterization will combine standardized Allen Institute pipelines: whole-brain cellular imaging, multiplexed
fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH), as well as scRNA-seq. DNA constructs, transgenic mice, virus
packaging techniques, recommended virus titers, and virus and transgene characterization data will be made
available in public repositories."
10759416,"Summary, Project 1 (Comprehensively map the mesoscale thalamic circuits that
route subcortical inputs to frontal cortex)
Frontal cortex displays rich patterns of neural activity underlying action planning, decision-making, and short-
term memory. Across the brain, the cortex is strongly coupled to, and dependent upon, the thalamus, which
represents the central hub of the forebrain. Here we map circuits involving the non-sensory ('higher-order')
thalamus, which routes input from basal ganglia, midbrain, cerebellum, and hippocampus to the frontal cortex.
Our overarching hypothesis is each subcortical input acts through the thalamus to control activity in frontal cortex
and associated behavior. This idea is formalized in a modeling framework that links a dynamical systems view
of neural computation with multi-regional neural circuits (Project 5). This model needs to be constrained by
mesoscale (region-to-region) circuit diagrams linking subcortex to frontal cortex via thalamus. However, existing
anatomical information is insufficiently detailed to guide either in vivo electrophysiology (Projects 3, 4) or develop
computational models (Project 5). Therefore, a fine-scale mesoscale map of subcortex → thalamus → frontal
cortex circuits is required to understand signaling through these regions. In this project, we combine existing
pipelines for high-throughput imaging and informatics with cutting-edge, transcellular anterograde and retrograde
viral tracing methods and new types of reporter mice. These rigorous and comprehensive experiments will create
a fine-scale map between frontal cortex and non-sensory thalamus (AIM 1); discover the subcortical inputs to
different populations of thalamocortical (TC) cells (AIM 2); and map subcortical inputs to thalamus, including
divergence and convergence at the level of both thalamic regions and individual TC cells (AIM 3). Processed
and raw image data will be registered to a standardized coordinate framework and made readily available in an
accessible manner to the community."
10759418,"Summary, Project 2 (Produce the cell type-specific thalamocortical projectome)
Frontal cortex displays rich patterns of neural activity, which can be decomposed into 'activity modes'
corresponding to specific aspects of behavior (see Overall), such as the persistent activity correlated with short-
term memory, and rapidly cycling activity causing voluntary movements. Frontal cortex is strongly coupled to the
thalamus, the central hub of the forebrain. Subcortical information flows through the thalamus to the cortex. Most
of thalamus is non-sensory (‘higher-order’), with input from cerebellum, multiple parts of the midbrain, and
hippocampus, and outputs to most cortical areas (a detailed map of inputs is part of Project 1). This project aims
to uncover the thalamocortical (TC) cell types. These are excitatory neurons that receive input from subcortical
areas outside of the thalamus and project to the neocortex. Understanding TC types is critical because distinct
TC types likely correspond to specialized thalamocortical channels for transmission of information from sub-
cortex to cortex. We currently lack even a rudimentary conceptual framework for the function of non-primary-
sensory thalamus, in part because our knowledge of subcortex-thalamus-cortex circuits is at a nascent stage.
A limited set of morphological reconstructions have shown that the TC neurons are diverse across and within
thalamic nuclei defined by cytoarchitecture. Our preliminary data suggest that different control signals arise in
different subcortical areas, with distinct effects on cortical activity modes. The input-output rules at the level of
individual thalamocortical (TC) cells constrain the possible control strategies. Are subcortical control signals
routed through independent TC types or even different thalamic nuclei (‘labeled lines’)? Or do multiple subcortical
inputs converge at the level of TC cells, with individual TC types transmitting a mixture of control signals?
To help address these questions we will establish a census of TC types across the higher-order thalamus,
including neurons projecting to anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We will
use new methods that combine morphological reconstructions of entire TC neurons with transcriptomics for the
same cells. We refer to cells defined in this manner as morpho-transcriptomic (m-t) TC types. We will further
densely map cell types defined by transcriptomics, so-called t-types, across the entire thalamus. By linking
morphology, transcriptomics and location at the single neuron level, these data will provide the foundation for
genetic access of specific TC types (strategies for genetic access will be developed in the Molecular Science
Core). Together, this information will create knowledge and tools for cell type-specific analysis of multi-regional
circuits (Projects 3, 4) with thalamus in the middle."
10759421,"Summary, Project 3 (Impact of subcortical inputs on frontal cortex via thalamus)
The goal of this project is to elucidate the functional influence of subcortical inputs on the frontal cortex via non-
sensory ('higher-order') thalamus. Each part of the frontal cortex receives inputs from multiple thalamic nuclei,
each of which in turn receives inputs from diverse subcortical brain regions. Our recent work has established
clear motifs for how different thalamic inputs can engage specific populations of pyramidal cells and interneurons
in the frontal cortex. However, we still lack even a basic understanding of how subcortical inputs are organized
in the thalamus, including how they are routed at the level of thalamic nuclei and single thalamocortical (TC)
cells. Here we test the hypothesis that each subcortical input either excites or inhibits a defined subset of TC
cells to engage specific networks in the frontal cortex. In Aim 1, we use electrophysiology to study the
organization and influence of specific subcortical inputs on the thalamus and cortex in the intact brain. This work
leverages new, high-density Neuropixels 2.4 probes that allow dense sampling of TC cell activity across thalamic
nuclei. These experiments will define convergence and divergence rules in the thalamus and determine how
subcortical signals propagate to frontal cortex. In Aim 2, we use brain slice electrophysiology to determine the
properties of subcortical connections onto identified TC cells in the thalamus. We incorporate patch-Seq analysis
to assess gene expression of each recorded neuron, linking processing of subcortical inputs with TC cell type.
This work builds on Projects 1 and 2 and the Molecular Science Core, providing a foundational analysis of
subcortical connections to the thalamus. In Aim 3, we then use voltage imaging in slices to examine how specific
subcortical-thalamic pathways engage distinct networks across the frontal cortex, focusing on medial prefrontal
cortex and motor cortex. Here we use anterograde viruses to conditionally express optogenetic tools in TC cells
that then engage specific networks in the frontal cortex. We also employ mFISH to assess the genetic signatures
of imaged excitatory and inhibitory cells, again allowing for sub-populations to be determined. Together, our
experiments will establish the organization and properties of connections from subcortical inputs to higher-order
thalamus and in turn the frontal cortex. They will serve as a strong foundation for our behavioral studies in Project
4, and constrain multi-regional models of neural computation developed in Project 5."
10759423,"Summary, Project 4 (Identify the schemata by which subcortical signals influence
frontal cortical dynamics and cognitive behaviors)
This research project is focused on dynamic interactions between subcortical areas and frontal cortex via
thalamus during flexible behavior. Frontal cortex, including motor cortex and medical prefrontal cortex, displays
complex patterns of neural activity that correlate with behavior. These patterns can be decomposed into activity
modes (i.e. subspaces in activity space), such as the persistent activity correlated with short-term memory, and
the rapidly modulated activity associated with voluntary movements. Complex behaviors correspond to
sequences of cortical activity modes. Frontal cortex is tightly coupled with higher-order (non-sensory) thalamus
to mediate behavior. Thalamus in turn receives driving input from the basal ganglia the and other subcortical
structures. We test the hypothesis that different subcortex inputs to specific thalamic regions control different
aspects of cortical activity, including setting the time periods when short-term memories are maintained, the
transitions from motor planning to movement execution (Aim 1), and updating and maintaining the values of
specific actions during foraging. Our modeling framework (Overall, Project 5) links the dynamical systems
perspective of neural computation with actual multi-regional neural circuits and makes predictions that can be
tested with neurophysiology.
We employ two behavioral tasks in mice that engage well-defined but distinct cortical activity modes. In a
memory-guided response task, neurons in the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show preparatory activity,
which predicts specific future movements. Just before the onset of movement, preparatory activity collapses in
favor of activity modes that drive movement. In a dynamic foraging task, neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) show slowly varying activity patterns that correlate with the value of one action compared to another.
This activity is updated based on new information, such as the size of a reward. Projects 1 - 3 provide information
about the circuits linking subcortical areas, thalamus, and ALM / mPFC. Building on these circuit mapping
experiments we will perform simultaneous recordings from connected subcortex → thalamus → cortex circuits
using new multi-shank Neuropixels probes with 5120 recording sites (Project 3). We will combine these
recordings with optogenetic manipulations of subcortex and modern multi-variate analysis methods (Data
Science Core) to track how subcortical signals propagate through the thalamus into cortex. In the memory-guided
response task we will probe the role of the substantia nigra reticulata, acting via the ventromedial nucleus, on
maintenance of movement planning, and the impact of midbrain movement centers (e.g. pedunculopontine
nucleus), acting via the posterior mediodorsal nucleus, on switching from movement planning to movement
initiation (Aim 1). In the foraging task, we will probe how error prediction signals, for example from ventral
pallidum (PALv), update memory-related activity in the mPFC via anterior mediodorsal thalamus. These
measurements will test key model predictions and in turn inform multi-regional circuit models of cognitive
behavior."
10759427,"Summary, Project 5 (Models of computation in multi-regional circuits with
thalamus in the middle)
In close interplay with experiments from Projects 1-4, this computational project aims to understand how the
dynamic interplay between cortex, thalamus and other subcortical structures underlies decision-making
behaviors that depend on short-term memory and reward-dependent learning. We develop a theoretical
framework for the multi-regional circuit mechanism underlying the generation and control of behavior-related
activity modes in frontal cortical areas. In our framework cortical activity modes, corresponding to subspaces of
neural population activity, are subject to control from thalamic nuclei (non-sensory, 'higher-order'), which in turn
receive driving input from subcortical inputs. Moreover, we will study how subcortical inputs to the thalamus,
such as from the midbrain and basal ganglia, interact in the thalamus to generate control strategies that organize
sequences of cortical activity modes driving the behaviors required to solve a task. We explore the roles of
cortical cell types that are activated by thalamocortical neurons in the generation and control of activity modes
that are relevant for short-term memory maintenance and motor execution. We further study value-based
decision making in a dynamic foraging task that leads to Herrnstein’s matching law of choice behavior. Our
circuit model will implement two candidate mechanisms for updating and maintenance of action values,
decision-making based on action values, as well as its transformation to behavioral choice and action. The
model implements multiple loops involving cortex, subcortex and thalamus in the middle, all based on
connectomic data (from Projects 1-3) and will guide multi-regional recordings (Projects 4). To conclude,
computational research will be carried out in close coordination with anatomical, behavioral and
neurophysiological experiments. Model predictions will be tested, and experimental results will shape the
models. This collaboration will lead to foundational advances in our understanding of computations in multi-
regional neural circuits."

I am interested in the molecular biology and genetics of microbial social interactions. We use the
saprophyte and opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model to study social
behaviors. P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell signaling system called quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate
gene expression. Because gene expression is coordinated at the population level, QS in P. aeruginosa,
and other bacteria, is a means by which these single-celled organisms can cooperate and engage in
specific group activities.
In our prior NIGMS funded work, we established an experimental evolution system in which we
demonstrated that P. aeruginosa QS can circuits diversify in response to changing environments. We
also developed microbial co-culture systems, which allow us to ask about interspecies competition and
how QS might impact interspecies interactions. The thrusts in this application ask 1) in cooperating
populations of bacteria, what is the genetic basis for the diversification of the QS circuity, and does this
diversification result in a division of labor where different individuals contribute separate functions to the
group? and 2) how do the interactions between P. aeruginosa and other microbes influence P.
aeruginosa behaviors, and how does QS contribute to these interactions?
Bacteria, because of their rapid generation time and large population sizes, allow us to ask questions
about social behavior that are not possible in organisms with smaller populations or longer generation
times. The questions asked in this proposal will advance our knowledge of P. aeruginosa QS,
cooperative behaviors in populations and interspecies interactions, and will inform efforts to target P.
aeruginosa QS as a therapeutic approach."
10765651,"Project summary. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) heat and vaporize a nicotine-containing liquid
to produce an aerosol that can deliver nicotine to the blood and the brain. ENDS are considered tobacco products
in the US and are under the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration. ENDS use has increased
rapidly in the last decade, especially among youth: over 20% of US high school students are current ENDS
users, and there is evidence of nicotine dependence in this population. Federal legislation has been proposed
that would restrict ENDS liquid nicotine concentration to make ENDS “significantly less addictive and appealing
to youth.” However, these and other efforts to curb addiction by limiting nicotine liquid concentration are unlikely
to succeed because nicotine emissions from ENDS depend on multiple variables. For example, where nicotine
concentration is limited, users can turn to a higher power ENDS device to attain more nicotine. To achieve the
intended public health aims, regulations targeting addiction must focus on nicotine delivery, not nicotine
concentration. While nicotine delivery cannot be regulated directly, the rate at which an ENDS emits nicotine,
the “nicotine flux” can be regulated and, importantly, predicted from first-principles based on knowledge of a few
device design and operating variables. However, to date there is no empirical evidence demonstrating the
relationship between flux and delivery, nor between flux and the physiological and subjective effects that support
nicotine dependence. Closing this gap is essential for providing an effective, first-principles framework for
regulating ENDS. In Aim1, we will examine the relationship between nicotine flux, nicotine form, and the rate
and dose of nicotine delivery. In the clinical lab at Yale University, participants will puff on ENDS devices under
conditions that differ by flux and form, while arterial blood is sampled in high time resolution. The outcome will
indicate the degree to which nicotine flux and form determine the speed and dose of ENDS nicotine delivery,
and thus, abuse liability. In Aim2, we will assess the relationship between nicotine flux, form, and subjective
effects. At the American University of Beirut, participants will use ENDS devices with varying nicotine fluxes and
forms. Dependency measures, such as urge to smoke, craving, and abstinence, will be assessed. The outcome
will indicate the degree to which nicotine flux/form influence subjective effects related to dependency, puffing
intensity, and exposure to toxicants. In summary, this project will provide the empirical evidence needed for
public health agencies to use nicotine flux as an encompassing and convenient construct to regulate nicotine
delivery from ENDS."

The Massachusetts (MA) Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (MCBDRP) proposes to continue
its strong track record of conducting etiologic research to identify modifiable risk factors for structural birth
defects through its participation in the Birth Defects Study to Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS). We
will enhance our contributions by leveraging our longstanding relationship with local universities to produce
future birth defects researchers. The MCBDRP brings to BD-STEPS our expertise and leadership in
pharmacoepidemiology and collaborative utilization of unique data resources to be applied to all three key
areas of interest named in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. Our research will utilize existing data from the
National Birth Defects Prevention Study and BD-STEPS, as well as data collected in the next iteration of BD-
STEPS. The MCBDRP investigators are committed and successful mentors and collaborative partners, roles
that will continue and expand within BD-STEPS. Over the three and a half year grant period, the MCBDRP will
complete at least seven etiologic research projects of public health significance that will aid in counseling
women in considering exposures that are less likely to result in a birth defect; these projects include: 1)
Assessing anti-obesity medications that have been and will continue to be approved by FDA and assessing
bariatric surgical procedures that are increasingly performed which may lead to beneficial weight loss, though it
is uncertain how potential nutritional deficiencies may impact subsequent pregnancies; 2) Investigating
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications, the use of which has increased dramatically; 3) Evaluating
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pathway inhibitors and the potential preventive effect of supplementation
with niacin; 4) Evaluating medication use during pregnancy by severity classifications of congenital anomalies;
5) Gauging the complex relationship among multiple risk factors to further our understanding of birth defects; 6)
Examining anti-viral medications, which are key to preventing maternal-fetal transmission but for which little is
known about their safety with respect to birth defects; and 7) Leveraging the MA State Public Health
Laboratory’s reportable disease database to explore the role of infections before and during pregnancy on the
development of birth defects. Through these activities, the MCBDRP will be an essential partner in BD-STEPS
to achieve our overall goal of translating research findings into meaningful initiatives in birth defects prevention."

Excessive angiogenesis in patients with ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular
degeneration, causes the majority of severe vision loss in the US. Current treatments are not appropriate or
successful for all patients, calling for additional means to manage ocular neovascularization. Recent work from
the Eichmann lab suggests that increased angio-suppressive transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in
endothelial cells (ECs) could successfully restrict angiogenic sprouting. While previous studies accept that
downstream TGFβ signaling effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 cooperate downstream of TGFβ receptor activation,
EC-specific ablation of either SMAD has different effects on EC behavior (unpublished data by candidate). This
implies that selective manipulation of TGFβ downstream signaling arms is required in order to maximize
therapeutic potential. In AIM 1 we will implement conditional mouse models to dissect the roles of endothelial
SMAD2 and 3 during retinal angiogenesis. In addition, we will identify specific gene targets of either SMAD in
ECs by Next-Generation RNA Sequencing. This analysis will reveal a number of new SMAD transcriptional
targets with potential influence on vascular function, some of which will prove to be suitable for therapeutic
intervention. AIM 2 will focus on the functions of Neuropilin 1 (NRP1), which is a powerful suppressor of TGFβ
signaling in ECs. Conditional mouse models and in vitro approaches will be employed to delineate the specific
regulatory effects of NRP1 on TGFβ signaling. Finally, AIM 3 will integrate the results from the previous aims
with translational experimentation of preclinical models of vascular eye disease. This project will decipher the
role of endothelial TGFβ signaling in sprouting angiogenesis during physiological and pathological conditions,
using the eye retina as a model. Thus, this proposal is fully aligned with the mission of the National Eye Institute.
This application also includes a detailed training program that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to a principal
investigator position. The candidate has a solid background in vascular biology and has been building upon it
during the past two years by learning new methodologies and by optimizing the protocols required for the
fulfillment of this research proposal. The K99 phase of this award will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr.
Eichmann, who is an established leader in vascular patterning and retinal angiogenesis. Additional guidance and
support will be provided by Dr. Nicoli and Dr. Adelman, who are experts in comparative mRNA transcriptome
profiling and translational models of choroidal neovascularization respectively. The proposal will be carried out
at the Cardiovascular Medicine Division of Yale School of Medicine, which offers numerous training possibilities
in the form of courses, seminars and lectures, as well as plentiful opportunities for cross-disciplinary partnerships.
Overall this proposal will not only enhance our understanding on TGFβ-mediated regulation of sprouting
angiogenesis, but will also provide an excellent mentoring framework to create a future independent researcher."

 Our long-term goal has been to characterize the heterogeneous group of chronic lower airway
diseases (LAD) observed in World Trade Center (WTC) workers and volunteers, uncover their risk factors and
comorbidities, identify subgroups with adverse and favorable lung function trajectories and outcomes, and
develop and deploy novel imaging approaches to the investigation of the lung injury underlying them. Such
goal will in turn translate into better understanding of disease pathophysiology, more targeted,
personalized, and perhaps disease modifying treatment approaches, and improved surveillance and
prevention strategies.
 The goal of this project has been to characterize the transitions into chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) among former workers and volunteers at the WTC disaster site. Following our objective
characterization of our COPD cases, our multidisciplinary investigative team proposes to establish the
quantitative computed tomography (QCT) characteristics that may differentiate WTC-related from non-
WTC-related COPD, investigate characteristics and longitudinal lung function trajectories of WTC patients
with pre-COPD, and investigate lung mechanical strain (LMS) as an early QCT marker of lung injury
associated with chronic disease and accelerated longitudinal lung function decline.
 This project will be conducted in the occupational cohort followed at Mount Sinai. To that end, we
will utilize the WTC Pulmonary Evaluation Unit Chest CT Imaging Archive, a large repository with more than
3000 chest CT images on 1700 WTC workers, as well as linked datasets with disease symptoms, both pre-
WTC and WTC-related occupational exposures, detailed pulmonary function and longitudinal spirometry
measurements and body weight trends, visual imaging classification and grading, and quantitative computer
tomography (QCT) measurements of airway, body composition, and pulmonary parenchymal and vascular
abnormalities."

Certain key processes in the HIV-1 viral lifecycle are still poorly or incompletely understood. These processes
include the release of the virion from infected cells, the virion maturation, and the genome packaging within the
virion as it matures. These processes are highly complex, involving sequential multiprotein and nucleic acid
assembly and disassembly, as well as protein-mediated membrane interactions. Computationally simulating
these processes thus requires the use of both all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD)
methods in an innovative multiscale fashion in order to access the relevant spatial and temporal scales. The
Voth group will develop and carry out both AA and CG simulations to study the large viral protein complexes
relevant to these important problems in the HIV-1 life cycle. The specific processes to be studied are involved
in the viral release and maturation processes, specifically the proteolytic cleavage of Gag and capsid assembly
within the virion (Aim 1), the virion component reorganization and ribonucleoprotein complex condensation upon
maturation (Aim 2), and the latter stage dynamics of virion release from infected cells (Aim 3). The computational
model development and multiscale simulation efforts will be integrated and iterated with the experimental studies
of two leading experimental investigators (John Briggs and Hans-Georg Kräusslich) and one independently
funded collaborator (James Hurley). These novel and powerful multiscale computer simulations – and the
collaborative effort with experimentalists – will provide new insight into the dynamical aspects of HIV-1 release
and maturation which are not readily accessible to the experimental (or computational) efforts alone."

 T cell anergy is a cell-intrinsic program of non-responsiveness to self-antigens, and is an important
component of peripheral tolerance. As the induction and maintenance of anergy is critical to preventing
breakdown of tolerance and initiation of autoimmunity, it is important to understand the mechanisms and
molecules that regulate anergy. Initially, T cell anergy was induced by TCR stimulation in the absence of
costimulation and a variety of stimuli have been used in vitro to induce anergy. This early work demonstrated
the critical importance of activation of the Ras/Map kinase pathway upon TCR/CD28 stimulation for T cell
activation, IL-2 production and proliferation. However, the mechanism is not clear as to how the Ras/Map
kinase pathway is downregulated in anergic T cells. Recently, endogenously anergic T cells in WT mice
have been identified and are characterized by high expression of CD73 and FR4. We have found that these
naturally anergic FR4+CD73+ CD4+ T cells in vivo from WT mice express lower levels of Runx1 protein as
compared to other CD4+ T cell subsets. TCR/CD28-induced activation of CD4+ T cells with conditional
deletion of Runx1 resulted in lower IL-2 expression and reduced proliferation as compared to activation of WT
CD4+ T cells. In addition, there was a higher frequency of naturally anergic FR4+CD73+ CD4+ T cells in CD4-
cre Runx1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice or tamoxifen-treated ER-cre Runx1 cKO mice in mixed bone
marrow chimeras. Thus, deletion of Runx1 in mature CD4+ T cells predisposes them to the development of T
cell anergy. To understand the mechanism(s) responsible for hypo-responsiveness of Runx1-deficient T cells
upon TCR/CD28 stimulation, RNAseq analysis was performed on WT and Runx1-deficient CD4+ T cells.
Runx1-deficient CD4+ T cells upregulated expression of Dab2IP, an adaptor molecule that has been shown in
non-hematopoietic cells to be a negative regulator of Ras signaling. Dab2IP contains a Ras-GAP domain,
which leads to the inactivation of Ras through accelerating hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. To determine whether
increased Dab2IP expression could inhibit T cell activation and promote anergy induction, we generated a
novel cre-dependent, dox-regulatable Dab2IP transgenic mouse. Our initial results demonstrate that similar
to CD4+ T cells conditionally deleted for Runx1, Dab2IP Tg CD4+ T cells have increased frequencies of
naturally anergic FR4+CD73+ CD4+ T cells in their memory cell pool. Our hypothesis is that increased
expression of Dab2IP interferes with normal TCR/CD28 signaling, preventing T cell activation, and
predisposing T cells to the development of anergy."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the growth and accumulation of monoclonal malignant plasma cells
in the bone marrow. MM remains incurable due to its high rate of relapse and the development of drug resistance
to therapy. Moreover, MM causes a devastating bone disease, increasing fracture risk and decreasing quality of
life. Notch signaling, a pathway mediating cell communication in the MM tumor microenvironment (TME),
promotes MM proliferation and MM cell survival and stimulates bone destruction. Notch inhibition decreases MM
growth and bone disease in preclinical models, but causes unwanted severe, dose-limiting side effects. The
long-term goal of this proposal is to examine Notch receptor 3 (Notch3), a membrane-bound Notch receptor
integrating cell-to-cell Notch signals from surrounding cells, as a target to treat MM. The premise of these studies
is supported by published and preliminary work showing that 1) cells of TME activate Notch signaling and
increase Notch3 expression in MM cells, 2) Notch3 signaling in MM cells promotes MM cell proliferation and
bone destruction, and 3) Notch3 signaling dictates MM cell responses to Bortezomib-based therapies. The
specific goal of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of targeting Notch3 to decrease tumor growth, mitigate
bone disease, and improve therapeutic responses to front-line therapies in MM. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that Notch3 in MM cells integrates TME signals leading to tumor growth, bone destruction, and drug
resistance. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the effects of the
pharmacological inhibition of Notch3 on MM growth, bone destruction, and its impact on the transcriptome of
TME and MM cells. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of Notch3 signaling in MM cells on TME-induced resistance to
Bortezomib-based therapies and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. To complete these aims, I have
assembled a mentoring team of leaders in cancer and drug resistance, bone biology, bioinformatics, and imaging
that will allow me to receive a unique multidisciplinary and rigorous training, preparing me to pursue a career as
an independent academic scientist."

Many processes essential for HIV-1 viral replication are driven by the association of regulatory RNA elements in
the retroviral genome and host/viral proteins that form biologically active complexes. Despite advances in solving
the 3D structures of RNA-protein complexes and in measuring RNA-protein interactions in vitro and in cells, our
current understanding of RNA-protein interactions is qualitative and not quantitative, descriptive, not predictive.
Attaining a quantitative and predictive understanding is necessary to reveal the forces and conformational states
driving viral processes and to fully define the landscape of opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The
overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the cellular transcriptional activity of HIV-1 TAR RNA can be
predicted from its sequence based on its conformational propensity to form the binding-competent conformation
and its affinity for the transactivator protein Tat and the human super elongation complex (SEC) Tat:SEC. The
project will (i) develop a suite of technologies to obtain experimental data on RNA ensembles, RNA-protein
interactions, and cellular activity quantitatively in high throughput over a large and common expanse of RNA
sequence and structure space (ii) closely integrate NMR data with computational molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and empirical RNA structure prediction algorithms (FARFAR) to determine RNA ensembles free and
bound to proteins and to test and guide refinement of the computational models through a community wide effort;
and (iii) test and refine a thermodynamic model predicting cellular function that dissects TAR•Tat:SEC binding
energetics into contributions from intermolecular contacts and conformational propensities. From a common
library of 1000s of TAR RNA variants, Aim 1 will determine conformational propensities and measure binding
affinities to Tat and Tat:SEC across solution conditions and measure transcriptional activation in cells and with
Tat concentration varied. The data will be used to develop a quantitative and predictive model for cellular
transcriptional activation based on in vitro measurements and iteratively refine the model. Aim 2 will integrate
NMR data with MD simulations and FARFAR; determine atomic-resolution ensembles for 20 TAR variants, free
and bound to the Tat RNA binding domain; use the ensembles to define the bound conformational states and
refine conformational propensities; identify strengths and weaknesses of MD and FARFAR; and develop and test
a new method (FARFAR-CS) for determining RNA ensembles and use it to refine propensities for 100s of TAR
variants. Aim 3 will extend the model to include alternative secondary structure propensities, use NMR
experiments to measure these propensities for 100s of TAR variants, and extend the model to include binding
of 20 small molecules and competition with 7SK RNA for 1000s of RNA variants. When completed, this project
will make it possible to quantitatively predict cellular transcriptional activity from TAR sequences, will reveal the
profound contribution of conformational propensities to RNA-protein binding, and will provide a roadmap for future
efforts that link biochemical and biophysical properties to molecular behavior and function in cells."

Sympathetic outflow to adipose tissue regulates whole body energy homeostasis by stimulating lipolysis in
white adipocytes and thermogenesis in brown or beige adipocytes. Using a novel approach to study human
adipose tissue in mice [1, 2], we have found that, during development, human adipocytes express a high level
of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a major mechanism for degradation of norepinephrine, and a known
target of antidepressant drugs [3]. Notably, expression of Maoa is virtually undetectable in mouse adipocytes,
indicating that this control mechanism may have evolved to meet the metabolic features of larger species. We
find that human adipocyte MAOA is decreased during beige adipose tissue development, potentially increasing
norepinephrine bioavailability, adrenergic tone and thermogenic capacity. Thus, MAOA expression in human
adipocytes is a previously underappreciated, key mechanism controlling adipose tissue functions,
potentially underlying susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disease. In this proposal, we will further test
the hypothesis that adipocyte MAOA controls systemic energy homeostasis through its effects on adipose tissue
sympathetic responsiveness. We have developed methodologies to obtain large numbers of human multipotent
mesenchymal progenitor cells that can differentiate into multiple adipocyte subtypes, and can generate
functional adipose tissue upon implantation in vivo. We have also successfully deleted MAOA from these cells
using a novel nanoparticle-based, CRISPR-Cas9 protein delivery technique, resulting in a >90% depletion of
MAOA protein while avoiding non-specific effects of expressed Cas9. Leveraging these technologies, we
shall: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that human adipocyte MAOA limits lipolytic and thermogenic responses to
norepinephrine. We will measure lipolysis and induction of thermogenesis in control and MAOA-deleted
human adipocytes exposed to norepinephrine, as well as steady-state norepinephrine levels and dependency on
the monoamine transporter Oct3. Aim 2. We will test the hypothesis that MAOA in human adipocytes
regulates the development and responsiveness of thermogenic adipose tissue in vivo. We will measure the
rate and extent of vascularization and innervation, and thermogenic responsiveness to environmental stimuli of
tissue developed in NSG mice from control or MAOA deleted human adipocytes. Aim 3. We will test the
hypothesis that expression of MAOA in adipocytes will determine susceptibility to obesity, systemic insulin
sensitivity and systemic glucose homeostasis. We will analyze weight gain, adipocyte size, insulin sensitivity,
glucose disposal under hyper insulinemic, hyperglycemic clamps, and basal metabolic rate in mice harboring
adipose depots formed from control or MAOA deleted human adipocytes, and in mice overexpressing MaoA in
subcutaneous adipose tissue. These aims will provide the basis for further development of tissue specific
MAOA-targeting strategies as novel therapeutics for metabolic disease."

Impaired endothelial wound healing in blood vessels like the coronary artery and saphenous vein is a primary
contributor to vascular stent failure and deadly coronary thrombosis. Identifying the mechanism of delayed
endothelial repair is essential for improving vessel patency and patient survival rates. As such, this proposal
focuses on identifying regulators of normal endothelial healing and understanding how these factors are
dysregulated when healing is impaired. Previous studies have shown connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junctions may
regulate wound healing. However, the specific role of connexin 43 in endothelial cell (EC) healing is unknown.
Preliminary data in this proposal indicates that ligation-induced vascular injury promotes increases in the
expression of EC Cx43 surrounding the damaged area in the aorta and carotid arteries in mice. Cx43-mediated
gap junction intracellular communication is controlled by phosphorylation at the Cx43 C-terminus. My preliminary
data demonstrate that specific Cx43 phosphorylation at its serine (s) 368, associated with gap junction closure,
is present during the final stages of EC wound healing in vivo. Cx43-s368 also reduced the rate of wound closure
in cultured human EC. These findings inform the hypothesis that Cx43 expression and channel functions are
critical for EC wound healing in large arteries. The aims of this proposal are to define the role of connexin 43 in
endothelial wound healing (Aim 1), investigate if a loss of Cx43 limits healing in vivo (Aim 1), and test if channel
functions, regulated by posttranslational modifications, improve/delay vascular repair (Aim 2). This investigation
will be completed using a novel mouse carotid EC injury survival surgery in mice I developed, which will allow
for the assessment of Cx43 expression in carotid EC during the healing process. Both genetic and
pharmacological strategies will be used to alter Cx43 expression and phosphorylation in mouse injury models
and in cultured human EC, and the impact of these modifications on the rate and quality of EC healing will be
quantified. Additionally, RNAseq approaches will be used to identify Cx43 gap junction-dependent signaling in
the regenerating endothelium. These aims will be accomplished under the mentorship of researchers with
extensive experience in vascular biology, Dr. Scott Johnstone, Dr. Robert Gourdie, and Dr. Brant Isakson, at
Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute (FBRI). The FBRI is home to research equipment including
but not limited to animal facilities, confocal microscopes, flow cytometers, and cell culture equipment. This state-
of-the-art research environment will allow for a detailed and mechanistic investigation. Ultimately, this study will
characterize a novel role for Cx43 in vascular EC. This project is designed to identify new potential therapeutic
targets in vascular disease that will promote the mission of the NIH to enhance patient health and to promote
longer life free of illness."

The scientific mission of this SCORE is to identify stress-immune pathway abnormalities, beginning in fetal
development, that have shared consequences for sex differences in brain circuitry regulating mood and lifelong
recurrent MDD and dysregulation of hormone and immune responses to stress, and autonomic and
neurovascular dysfunction in early midlife. We aim to facilitate transdisciplinary, translational collaboration
among basic and clinical investigators to enhance our understanding of the impact of sex on MDD and central
and peripheral autonomic function and translate this knowledge into sex-selective therapeutics. Further, we
aim to serve as an interdisciplinary resource to train and disseminate findings about sex differences in MDD
and autonomic dysregulation to the scientific and medical communities, policy makers, and the public.
To accomplish our aims in three projects and three cores, we are proposing a series of interdisciplinary and
translational studies from basic and clinical neuroscience and population-level perspectives, integrating
scientists from different disciplines and institutions ranging from the lab bench to the clinical level. In the
Resource Support Core (RSC), we are integrating and introducing novel state-of-the-art technologies, with
some that will cross human and animal work. In the Career Enhancement Core (CEC), educating young
scientists in new approaches and insuring that their future work will translate sex as a biologic variable into
their (and others') thinking in clinical medicine. The Leadership Administrative Core (LAC) is essential in
providing an infrastructure to monitor, integrate, and synergize ongoing activities. The specific aims of the LAC
are to: Coordinate activities of the SCORE; Administer budgets, insuring financial responsibility and
coordination across sites and activities; and Disseminate knowledge through online tools, organizing symposia
and workshops and other avenues to connect the SCORE with the medical community, policy makers, NIH,
and the public."
10766722,"The Career Enhancement Core (CEC) will contribute to training the next generation of scientists and
clinician- scientists as leaders in the fields of women's health and sex differences in medicine. They will be
empowered to contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to major psychiatric and associated
medical disorders. Our SCORE focuses on understanding sex differences in major depression and associated
autonomic physiology and translation of this knowledge into the development of sex-dependent therapeutics.
Defining the impact of gender in addition to sex, will prepare our participants to think about translation of
scientific findings to policy and advocacy. Training the next generation as to the importance of sex and gender
in understanding medicine and healthcare will be critical in realizing the national strategic plan to develop
precision or personalized medicine. The SCORE faculty have a long history of training people to think about
sex and gender in medicine. We will integrate the training infrastructures of the SCORE partners focused on
women's health and sex differences in diseases to provide new opportunities, expand resources, add new
faculty, and educate trainees with regard to new technologies and approaches. The CEC will capitalize on a
long tradition of interdisciplinary research collaborations on sex differences and women's health among
investigators across these institutions, including a previous ORWH P50 SCOR that focused on sex differences
in major depression across HMS, CSU, and the University of Arizona. We have made available to our mentees
a vast array of biomedical resources across institutions that address scientific questions essential to improving
women's health. To enhance the careers of SCORE trainees, the CEC will specifically: 1) Integrate levels of
training and thought about etiologic mechanisms at basic and clinical levels for sex differences, and for gender
and health disparities at the policy level. 2) Mentor trainees from a team perspective that exposes them to
different levels of analysis from mentors with complementary expertise. 3) Provide access to material and
faculty resources that will enhance the success of the initial group of candidates. The CEC infrastructure will
provide a model that can be generalized to others in the future, playing a convening/integrative role in training
the next generation across fields, methodologies and institutions. We are also committed to training a diverse
biomedical workforce, as exemplified by the first set of participants and investigators included in this SCORE.
Two junior faculty will serve as initial models for implementing this CEC based on their interests in sex
differences in immune pathways in the brain, fetal programming and offspring brain development, and impact
of pregnancy complications on offspring brain and cardiac function. Finally, we will (4) provide seed funding to
supplement work with the preclinical studies and ultimately translate to the human studies. In summary, this
core will create individually-tailored curricula that will take advantage of mentorship strengths across
institutions and foster the professional skills of a next generation of rising stars for women's health research."
10766724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Resource Support Core (RSC) will provide infrastructure and tools to enable a cohesive approach to the
collection, analysis, storage and sharing of data across the SCORE projects. The RSC will also provide expert
support in areas such as biostatistics, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, and advance autonomic and
neuroimaging analyses. Establishing a unified approach enhances the quality of all studies, allowing each
project to inform the others in potentially significant ways, and enabling valuable exploratory analyses through
the pooling of data collected by multiple projects. The noninvasive nature of MRI allows for multiple
experiments on an individual subject, either during the course of one examination period or on multiple
occasions, as proposed in the current proposal to accomplish the aims of projects 1 and 2. The imaging data
must be registered accurately, in both space and time, and interpreted to isolate physiological phenomena of
interest from extraneous noise sources. Three-dimensional, high-resolution, anatomical MRI images will
provide the basis for interrelating neuroimaging information. A broad range of functional imaging analytic tools
will then be applied to interrogate both resting brain state and task- and/or stimulus-induced regional activation.
The image analysis tools we propose have been extensively tested and validated by investigators at the
Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, over many years. The RSC will provide access to this
broad neuroimaging expertise of the Martinos Center and will deliver a reproducible and efficient means to
obtain, analyze, test and correlate structural and functional neuroimaging with physiological data. The RSC will
also provide support on biomedical signal processing by developing and executing plans for advanced
mathematical modeling and processing of physiological measurements taken in both the animal and human
experiments. This will facilitate translational analyses of the mechanisms of autonomic dysregulation explored
in projects 1 and 3. Experts on the implementation of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation techniques in
human and animal models have been included in the RSC and will assist in the experimental set up and
interpretation of vagal neuromodulation effects on behavioral, imaging and physiological outcomes in projects
2 and 3. Beyond acquisition and analytic support, the RSC is designed to support critical cross-project data
analyses. Cross-project synergy is essential to the overall SCORE research plan and built into the design of
the projects. This will allow for interesting and potentially valuable pooled analyses of the data and will permit
us to address larger-scale questions about sex differences in the neuroscience of the neural
pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for autonomic dysregulation in major depression and sex
differences in the effects of a novel transcutaneous vagal stimulation technique on the attenuation of these
alterations."
10766726,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY. Major depressive disorder (MDD) topped ischemic heart disease as the number one
cause of disability worldwide, and women have twice the risk of men. Although this is well-known, even recent
studies of brain circuitry and genes associated with mood dysregulation and MDD per se do not investigate sex
effects nor incorporate even current sex-dependent knowledge into development of therapeutics. This is
surprising since MDD is associated with abnormalities in stress response circuitry including hypothalamus
(HYPO), amygdala (AMYG), hippocampus (HIPP), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventromedial and
orbital prefrontal cortices (vmPFC, OFC), areas that are among the most sexually dimorphic in the brain. HIPP,
HYPO, AMYG, and PFC are dense in sex steroid and glucocorticoid receptors coupled with cytokine receptors,
in particular, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, the major co-activators of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. In
fact, activity in these areas has been associated with cortisol response, autonomic dysfunction characterized
by loss of parasympathetic cardiac tone, and immune responses, which we previously showed differed by sex.
Furthermore, autonomic dysregulation is significantly associated with cardiovascular disease itself, with women
at twice the risk of the co-occurrence of MDD and heart disease, leading to a 3-5-fold risk of death in women
from heart disease, often with unrecognized and untreated MDD. This is a worldwide public health challenge,
and thus understanding early biomarkers for the co-occurrence later in life will provide knowledge to intervene
earlier. Leveraging a rare opportunity to investigate fetal antecedents to sex differences in adult MDD and
associated impact on central and peripheral physiology in early midlife in human in vivo studies, we will test
here that immune pathway abnormalities, beginning in fetal development, are associated with sex-dependent
impacts on HYPO, HIPP, AMYG and PFC, resulting in lifelong recurrent MDD (rMDD), and dysregulation of
hormone and immune responses to stress and autonomic dysfunction in early midlife. Adult subjects from our
prenatal cohort, for whom prenatal sera are archived and who have been included in our follow-up studies for
60 years, will be re-recruited (80 cases with rMDD/50 healthy controls, equally divided by sex, now ages 55-
61) for the proposed study. We will test whether these prenatal immune biomarkers are associated with lifelong
MDD and ANS and neurovascular dysregulation in early midlife (including structural and functional brain
abnormalities in stress response circuitry, physiologic dysregulation) and neurovascular dysfunction. We
predict that the sex differences in early midlife will be mediated by major depression in earlier adulthood, which
we predict is associated with sex-selective dysregulation of innate immunity resulting from maternal prenatal
exposure. Novel transcriptomic analyses of innate immunity genes will provide clues to immune pathways to
sex differences in MDD and autonomic dysregulation. Our lifespan perspective is an innovative approach that
will identify potential therapeutic sex-dependent targets for early intervention to attenuate disability later in life."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cancer Metabolism and Immunology (CMI) Program has evolved as a base for research in both cancer
metabolism and immunology focused on the interplay between the disciplines. The foundation of the CMI
program is built upon the following aims: 1) to delineate the role of cell metabolism in the control of tumor cell
growth, proliferation, and survival and to modulate metabolic pathways to improve cancer therapy; 2) to identify
the metabolic, physical, and immunological relationships between the tumor and host to identify new approaches
to cancer therapy; and 3) to discover and develop innovative immune-based cancer treatment strategies
including cell and gene therapy approaches.
The CMI program consists of 54 members across Rutgers, Princeton, and Rowan Universities. The CMI Program
has recruited 14 new members since the prior NCI site visit. As of November 1, 2022, CMI Program Members
have 44 NIH R01 or equivalent grants (with 32 different, independent PD/PIs), including 15 multi-PI projects.
CMI research is supported by $12.4 million in cancer-relevant funding (including $3.3 million in funding from the
NCI, a 25% increase since the last review). CMI members published 647 peer-reviewed, and cancer-relevant
papers with 277 appearing in high-impact journals (impact factor ≥10).
CMI (previously CMG) was rated Excellent in the last review. In response to opportunities for improvement
identified by the review team, the CMI program increased high-impact research and collaborative grants with
cancer relevance, including through the newly established CINJ Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of
Excellence and the Ludwig Princeton Branch as a collaboration between the Ludwig Cancer Research Institute,
Princeton, CINJ and the RWJBarnabas Health System. CMI members also successfully competed for the new
multi-project CRUK/NCI Cancer Grand Challenges Award to study cancer cachexia. CMI also enhanced the
interaction among the three Aims and strengthened tumor immunology research. In addition, the CMI Program
has joined efforts with the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) team to promote catchment area
responsive and community engaged research. Program Members have 15 active R01 or R01 equivalent grants
that directly address our
CA
Priority cancer
s and risk factors. Program Members were also awarded a T32
postdoctoral training grant, led by PIs at Rutgers and Princeton. With the high level of scientific expertise and
collaborations between academic institutions, the CMI Program is now positioned to be a world leader in cancer
metabolism and immunology research."
10767723,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program is to advance population research
that elucidates and addresses Catchment Area (CA) cancer risks and outcomes, thus potentiating the impact of
translational research via collaboration among diverse faculty, trainees, and communities towards cancer health
equity. CPC utilizes CA resources (e.g., the NJ State Cancer Registry that is administered by CINJ, RWJBH
integrated health system) to identify and understand risk factors and outcome trajectories at multiple levels.
Members develop, evaluate, and inform implementation of interventions, strategies, guidelines, and policies to
address these risks, reduce cancer burden, and improve outcomes. Aligning with CINJ’s strategic plan and
catchment area priorities, CPC’s research falls into three major areas: 1) cancer epidemiology research that
evaluates multi-level factors (e.g., social determinants of health, neighborhood built environment, lifestyle and
biological factors) as predictors of racial and ethnic disparities in cancer risk, treatment, patient-reported
outcomes, and survival; 2) research designed to understand tobacco use and inform implementation of effective
tobacco control strategies; and 3) behavioral sciences research that elucidates and mitigates cancer risk, and
improves prevention and screening behaviors, as well as quality of life and other cancer outcomes through
theoretically-informed individual-, family-, system-level, and technology-based interventions and implementation
science. Since the last review, CPC has experienced considerable growth in expertise, funding, and
collaborations, with novel research findings and direct sustained public health impact. CPC currently has 58
members conducting cancer prevention and control research in 17 departments across seven schools in two
universities. In the current funding period, CPC members are highly productive, and collaborative as shown by
its 729 cancer-focused research publications, of which 33% are intraprogrammatic, 20% interprogrammatic, and
79% multi-institutional. CPC funding has also substantially increased by 67%, with a current research portfolio
of $10.2 million (annual direct costs) in cancer-relevant grant projects, with $6.9 million (direct costs) from NCI.
CPC is led by senior investigators with complementary expertise and distinct roles in leading the Program, Drs.
Elisa Bandera (epidemiology) and Carolyn Heckman (behavioral sciences). The Program benefits from diverse
expertise and transdisciplinary collaborations across the cancer continuum including prevention, survivorship,
health equity, care delivery and coordination, and tobacco control, as well as a strong record of mentoring the
next generation of diverse researchers in these areas. CPC research is invoked by bidirectional communication
with the Community Outreach and Engagement team and community to address CA needs that also impact
broader practices, policies, and health equity. Plans for the next funding period include enhancing
transdisciplinary research, cancer research training, and bidirectional community engagement to address CA
priorities, with the ultimate goal of reducing the cancer burden in NJ and beyond."
10767724,"GENOMIC INSTABILITY AND CANCER GENETICS PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goals of the Genomic Instability and Cancer Genetics (GICG) Program are to determine the
mechanisms by which genome stability is maintained to prevent tumorigenesis, to define the landscapes of
cancer genomes, and to expose the therapeutic vulnerability of cancer due to genomic alterations. The GICG
Program is organized around three themes: 1) fundamental mechanisms of genome maintenance in DNA repair,
replication fidelity, and cell cycle control; 2) modifying and regulatory factors of tumorigenesis; and 3) genomic
alterations in cancer.
The GICG Program is composed of a highly qualified and collaborative team of 40 Members with diverse and
complementary expertise from 21 departments, nine schools, three universities, and one institute. Our research
is currently supported by $10.8 million in cancer-relevant funding ($4.6 million annual direct funds from NCI), 32
cancer-focused NIH R01 or equivalent research grants to 21 independent PD/PIs and 14 multi-PI awards
including one P01 award. Productivity and collaboration within GICG are evident from the 523 cancer-focused
publications during 11/2017-10/2022 (compared to 483 during 11/2012-10/2017), 33% being collaborative
publications including 11% intra- and 28% interprogrammatic, 63% multi-institutional collaborative publications,
and 38% of the publications are in journals with impact factor (IF) of 10 or greater.
Examples of impactful science during the current grant period are exemplified by the application of an innovative
single-cell based CRISPR screen of ~450 DNA repair genes to decipher the in-depth mechanisms of DNA repair;
the demonstration of critical roles of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 interactions and associated factors in replication
fidelity, cell cycle checkpoint control and tumor suppression; the identification of a new mechanism of mitotic
spindle assembly; the discovery of novel functions of TP53 and its regulated genes in a diverse array of activities
that modulate tumor development; identification of new pathways in cell fate determination after DNA damage;
new findings on the relationship between tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis; identification of distinct
subgroups of neuroendocrine tumors, and identification and validation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2
(FGFR2) mutant targetable drivers; and the development of numerous genomic tools for precision oncology.
Examples of outstanding programmatic accomplishments and impact include the forward and reverse translation
of the mechanistic and genomic studies, the catchment relevance of GICG research to a broad range of cancer
types as well as key cancer risk factors, the Program participation in community outreach activities, training of
scientists from under-represented groups, and the highly collaborative and synergistic team science as reflected
by multi-PI awards and a new P01 program project grant."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey’s (CINJ) catchment area (CA) is the state of New Jersey (NJ), which
is home to 9.2 million residents in 21 counties. CINJ covers a densely populated, mainly urban geographic area
with a population that is more ethnically and racially diverse than the U.S. CINJ formalized its COE efforts in
2019 through the Cancer Health Equity Center of Excellence (CHECoE). Activities are led by an interprofessional
team of researchers, staff, and community organizations and members to address
the CA burden and needs
through high impact science and outreach. Dr. Anita Kinney, Associate Director for Population Science and
Community Outreach, leads the integration of COE into all aspects of CINJ. COE is informed by ongoing
surveillance of the CA burden, a vibrant Community Cancer Action Board (CCAB) of demographically diverse
members across NJ, and other highly engaged community partners. These activities and input help ensure that
various perspectives and communities’ voices are considered in program development, implementation,
evaluation, and decision-making. The
CHECoE includes
45 full time staff organized into five areas: CA
Surveillance and Research Support, Outreach and Education, Prevention and Care Navigation, Community
Partner Coordination
, and Administration. COE has swiftly become a vital part of NJ communities and CINJ
culture. With the CCAB and other community partners, CHECoE evaluat
es community needs and the cancer
burden to identify CA priorities as follows: 1) cancer sites of particular importance and associated risk factors; 2)
cancer disparities; 3) access to care; 4) geographic regions with disproportionately high cancer burdens; and 5)
research that addresses the CA burden and representation of diverse populations in research. CHECoE had
substantial impact during this funding cycle, including development of the CA data dashboard and a digital
community engagement platform; improvements in trial accruals, grants, and publications that address CA
priorities; creation of the CCAB, five Program Liaisons and 35 Community Scientists; 12 internal pilot awards;
two COE CCSG supplements; Community Science Cafés; and Science-to-Sidewalk/Sidewalk-to-Science
initiatives. We have also advanced implementation of evidence-based cancer control actions by: leveraging
community partnerships (357 partners at 522 sites); delivering professional education (attendance 15,932) and
technical assistance (1,875 visits/meetings); conducting educational outreach for community members (87,000+
through direct education, digital media and printed materials in 10+ languages); facilitating access to preventive
services (navigation to 52,000+ screenings resulting in the detection of >1,600 malignant and pre-malignant
lesions; and through policy-related efforts, including ScreenNJ. We will build on our strong foundation to
maximize our impact on how cancer affects NJ communities through research, outreach, and community
interactions.
With longer term data, we will assess our impact on cancer incidence, downward shifts in stage at
diagnosis, and mortality."
10767329,"Summary
The balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons is established early in development in a
process dominated by the interplay between the transcriptional activator PTF1A and the
repressor PRDM13 in multiple regions of the nervous system. Initial cell fate decisions that
ultimately give rise to inhibitory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina depend
on the early activity of these fate-specifying transcription factors (TFs). PTF1A, like other early-
acting basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, acts as a `master regulator' by triggering
downstream genetic cascades. Such TFs have profound effects by restricting progenitor
developmental potential long before the appearance of mature neurons. In the absence of
PTF1A, neural progenitors fail to generate inhibitory neurons and aberrantly assume an
excitatory neuronal fate. Thus, the spatial and temporal control of PTF1A expression controls the
formation of the inhibitory/excitatory balance in multiple neuronal circuits. In Aim 1 we will
examine the in vivo requirement for a dorsal neural tube specific enhancer for Ptf1a at the
molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. PRDM13, a transcriptional repressor and a direct
target of PTF1A, ensures correct specification of dorsal spinal cord inhibitory neurons by
repressing genes essential for specifying the alternative excitatory neuronal fates. Because
PRDM factors can have methyltransferase activity and/or can recruit other chromatin modifying
enzymes, and PRDM13 may bind to bHLH TFs, PRDM13 may provide a molecular link between
these factors and accompanying changes in the epigenetic landscape during neuronal subtype-
specification. Indeed, PRDM13 binds many similar genomic sites as PTF1A and another bHLH
factor ASCL1. In Aims 2 and 3, we will probe PRDM13 functions in the developing nervous
system, and test the hypothesis that PRDM13 is recruited to bHLH bound sites to facilitate
repressive chromatin modifications to repress transcription through these sites."
10767339,"Project Summary
Macrophage-mediated programmed cell removal (PrCR) allows clearance of living cells. We have shown that
this phagocytic process can eliminate cancer cells that present an ‘eat me’ signal and have their dominant 'don't
eat me' molecules blocked. We then further extended this to the clearance of other pathogenic or ‘expired’ cells.
The key novel findings of our recent studies are: 1. Activated macrophages produce and secrete calreticulin
(CRT); 2. Secreted CRT binds to surface asialoglycans on target cells to create ‘eat me signals' for
macrophages. 3. Cancer cells and neutrophiles modulate their surface to expose asialoglycan binding sites for
CRT that acts as an ‘eat me’ signal for macrophages. We propose that by binding both to asialoglycans and to
pro-phagocytic receptors on macrophages (CD91/LPR1), CRT can bridge target cells to macrophages for
clearance via PrCR. CRT is normally a resident ER protein containing a C-terminal KDEL retention signal, but
it’s been shown that in dying cells CRT can be translocated to the cell surface. We found that upon macrophage
activation via toll-like receptors (TLR), CRT can both translocate to the cell surface and be secreted, leading to
increased PrCR of either WT (dying) or Bcl-2+ (viable) peritoneal neutrophils and cancer cells on which the ‘don’t
eat me’ signal CD47 is either absent or blocked. Based on these findings we proporse: (1) to elucidate the
signals affecting the macrophage that result in CRT translocation to the cell surface and secretion of soluble
forms of CRT; (2) to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the availability of asialoglycan-containing binding sites
for CRT on target cells. Elucidating the individual mechanisms in macrophages and target cells required for PrCR
and understanding the cross-talk within macrophage:target-cell interaction can have broad therapeutic
implications. In Aim 1 we will investigate which signals stimulate macrophages to increase cell surface
expression and secretion of CRT for PrCR and the heterogeneity of macrophages that can carry out PrCR in
vitro and sterile inflammation in vivo. In Aim 2 we will employ proteomic analysis to define and characterize the
different proteoforms of CRT originating in macrophages before or after stimulation: the ER form vs. cell-surface-
bound, vs. soluble secreted CRT, vs. CRT that is bound to asialoglycans on target cells. We have preliminary
evidence that the secreted form of CRT does not contain the KDEL motif and that potential proteolytic processing
leads to the formation of the different CRT forms. Lastly in Aim 3 we will study the initiating signaling events and
enzymes that affect the addition or removal of sialic acid, the activity of which determines the level of exposed
asialoglycans and thus the binding of CRT to the surface of cells destined for elimination. These studies will shed
light on a novel mechanism by which macrophages detect cells that are to be removed from the body. Our
findings will have a broad relevance to cancer, degenerative disease, and inflammatory lesions and will likely
reveal new therapeutic targets for life altering disease conditions."
10784040,"ABSTRACT
During tumor progression, loss of cell:cell adhesion and detachment from the extracellular matrix induces
dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton, formation of invadopodia by the tumor cells, and activation of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This is enabled by tuning molecular programs in order to adapt to loss of
attachment. Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene, is a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin protein family that links
membrane proteins to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and regulates adhesion, migration, cell-cell contact,
proliferation, and signal transduction. Merlin is critically involved in contact-dependent inhibition of growth.
We found that Merlin protein levels are reduced in the majority of cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma and
metastatic breast cancer tissues. Decreased Merlin protein expression was also seen with advanced nodal
involvement in breast cancer. In order to ascribe clinical relevance, we re-capitulated the loss of Merlin in breast
cancer cells. Merlin deficiency elicited a markedly invasive phenotype, morphologically and programmatically
evident as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In order to overcome the challenge of embryonic lethality of a
total Nf2-knockout, we generated a unique mammary-specific Nf2-knockout mouse mammary tumor model.
These mice show remarkably accelerated development of tumors.
In this R21 application, our objective is to target potential liabilities in Merlin-deficient mammary tumors to mitigate
their metastasis-conducive tumor portfolio. Using multiple Merlin-deficient mammary tumor systems and tumor-
derived organoids, we will investigate (i) targeting aberrantly activated Hh signaling in Merlin-deficient tumors,
and (ii) the potential to target deregulated tryptophan metabolism in Merlin-deficient tumors. Our approaches are
non-overlapping and complementary. Outcomes from our work will present two unprecedented strategies to
target possible liabilities in Merlin-deficient breast cancer; these findings can be expanded and/or translated to
other tumor types that harbor Merlin deficiency."
10784045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Urogenital infections, including sexually transmitted infections and other genitourinary tract infections, are a
major source of morbidity and mortality in older women, yet how aging impacts mucosal immune protection in
the female genital tract (FGT) remains largely unknown. Thus, to enable the development of preventive
approaches effective in younger and older women, it is critical to identify the early mucosal mechanisms that
confer protection from infection in the FGT and learn how aging alters these protective mechanisms.
Neutrophils are key cells for first-line innate protection and are involved in responses to genital infections,
including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Neutrophils are also involved in physiological reproductive
functions and are the first-responder cells to sites of injury to initiate the wound healing process. While the
presence of other immune cell types declines with age in the FGT, neutrophils remain constant. However, despite
neutrophils’ critical role in innate protection and tissue homeostasis, and their continual presence in the FGT with
age, the extent to which aging impacts FGT neutrophil-mediated protection against infection or tissue
inflammation as women age is unknown.
The PI’s research group recently discovered that, despite neutrophil presence in the FGT of older women, their
antiviral responses are compromised. Using novel multi-omics technologies, they have identified different
subsets of neutrophils with defense and homeostatic functions, and defined neutrophil intra-tissue spatial
location and transcriptional profiles in younger women. Building on these preliminary results, the central
hypothesis is that aging modifies tissue distribution and function of specific neutrophil subsets, leading to
decreased neutrophil-mediated mucosal protection and increased tissue inflammation in the FGT as women
age.
Using human hysterectomy samples from endometrium, endocervix, and ectocervix from younger and older
women, this project will combine multi-omics single-cell sequencing approaches, tissue spatial transcriptomics,
and in vitro functional assays of genital neutrophils to define how aging modifies neutrophil defense and
homeostatic functions, tissue distribution, and their contribution to first-line mucosal protection.
It is expected that these studies will define, for the first time, the mechanisms responsible for neutrophil-mediated
protection in the FGT and how they are modified with aging. The identification of an inducible/modifiable form of
innate protection in the FGT and how aging modifies this protection will have a positive translational impact,
enabling the development of novel strategies for protection against sexually-transmitted infections and other
genitourinary tract infections in older women, a group that is generally excluded from STI prevention research."
10779323,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-metastatic breast cancer is treated surgically and with adjuvant therapies. As these treatments have
improved, recurrence-free survival has steadily increased, and late recurrence (recurrence beyond 10 years’
survival) has become a pressing issue for patients and providers. There are existing and emerging therapies
that prophylactically target dormant breast tumors to prevent late recurrence. However, these therapies carry
substantial toxicities and should only be used in women who are at high risk for late recurrence. No prognostic
assay is recognized by the American Society of Clinical Oncology or by the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network to reliably predict recurrence risk beyond 5 to 10 years. Our proposed work differs from earlier studies
of late recurrence biomarkers by including large samples of premenopausal and postmenopausal ER-positive
breast cancer patients who have survived 10 years recurrence-free, and by following patients for up to 20
years after initial diagnosis.
Within strata of menopausal status at diagnosis, we will identify 200 cases of late distant recurrence (occuring
>10 years after initial diagnosis and treatment) and match to these 200 recurrence-free controls on follow-up
time as well as calendar year, menopausal status, age, and stage at diagnosis. We will identify gene
expression profiles specific to late recurrence risk by comparing expression patterns in late recurrences and
controls using a robust ensemble of conventional and machine learning models We will bolster the rigor and
reproducibility of the identified expression panel by (a) fitting a host of viable models to identify predictive gene
expression levels and combining these into a powerful, consolidated ensemble; (b) employing in-sample cross-
validation to minimize the likelihood of overfitting and false-positive findings, and (c) assessing independence
of disovered genes from genes used in existing early recurrence models.
At project completion, we will have developed a primary breast tumor gene expression profile that can stratify
ER-positive breast cancer patients with respect to their late recurrence risk. This approach will provide
accurate risk stratification and a long lead time for initiating prophylactic therapy with one of several existing
and emerging drugs that eradicate or stabilize dormant tumor foci. The genes contributing to our new profile
and their associated biological pathways may also suggest new therapeutic targets to prevent late recurrence."
10780760,"Project Summary
Breast cancer is still the most common malignancy in women worldwide. Despite the incredible advances made
in the past decades towards eliminating breast cancer, nearly all women with metastatic breast cancer will
succumb to the disease. Therefore, we desperately need new and improved approaches towards eliminating
breast cancer. The proposed work focuses on a widely documented clinical finding with no known underlying
mechanism: blunted circulating glucocorticoid rhythms in patients with breast cancer. Critically, patients with ‘flat’
or ‘blunted’ circadian rhythms in circulating glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) report lower quality of life and die from
cancer earlier than patients with normal ‘robust’ circadian rhythms. Glucocorticoid rhythms are largely controlled
by concerted interactions among the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands (i.e., HPA-axis), and act to
regulate diverse physiological processes essential for health including immune cell trafficking/polarization,
energy mobilization, arousal, and synchronization of peripheral circadian clocks. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that preclinical mouse models of breast cancer also exhibit this ‘blunting’ of the glucocorticoid
rhythm, and this is accompanied by aberrant activity within hypothalamic neurons that regulate the HPA-axis
(i.e., PVNCRH neurons). Additionally, by re-establishing a robust glucocorticoid rhythm via chemogenetic
stimulation of these neurons, we were able to significantly impede primary breast cancer growth in mouse
models. In the present proposal, we will systematically determine where along HPA-axis dysfunction occurs in
response to breast cancer, identify the mechanism(s) driving this dysfunction, and then use orthogonal
approaches to manipulate these mechanisms to confer benefits (reduced tumor and metastatic burden,
enhanced responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy) in mouse models of breast cancer. These studies
represent a significant step forward in our understanding of how malignant processes influence the host, and
how host responses dictate cancer progression and therapeutic efficacy. These data will further inform the design
of novel therapeutic approaches towards eliminating breast cancer by targeting the HPA-axis."
10780824,"Corneal blindness is a leading cause of visual impairment, affecting an estimated 12.5 million people worldwide.
Corneal transplantation, or keratoplasty, is the only curative treatment for corneal blindness, yet the cadaveric
donor tissue required for this sight-restoring procedure is available to less than 2% of patients worldwide. While
several different tissue-engineered corneal transplants have been proposed, designing therapies with the long-
term transparency and regenerative capacity of a human donor cornea remains a formidable challenge. The
native cornea is a multi-layered tissue, with each layer playing a distinct role in the overall corneal function;
however, most tissue-engineered corneas to date have been monolithic structures. Here we propose leveraging
recent advances in 3D bioprinting to fabricate a bilayered, tissue-engineered cornea, with each layer fabricated
from a customized biomaterial formulation with optimized print parameters to achieve the desired biofunctionality.
This technology builds on our recently reported family of UNION bioinks that form cohesive, strong interfaces
between distinct biomaterials when 3D-printed into a tissue-engineered construct.
In Aim 1, we design a 3D-printed stromal layer with encapsulated corneal stromal stem cells (CSSCs) that resists
contraction, remains transparent, and secretes pro-regenerative paracrine signals. While CSSCs have the
potential to reduce scarring, their contractile phenotype leads to deformation of engineered tissue, altering the
shape, size, and transparency over time. We hypothesize that covalent crosslinking of a chemically modified
collagen type I bioink will enable printing of a mechanically robust hydrogel with ordered fibrils that guide cell
alignment and phenotype. Our preliminary data demonstrate that bio-orthogonal azide-alkyne click chemistry
crosslinking resists cell-induced deformation and promotes cell alignment. In parallel, in Aim 2, we design an
acellular 3D-printed basement membrane layer that promotes corneal epithelial cell (CEC) migration and forms
a cohesive interface with the 3D-printed stromal layer. CECs are known to alter their migration in response to
properties of their underlying basement membrane, which is distinct from the stromal layer. Clinical translation
requires a cohesive interface between these two layers to maintain a stable graft. We hypothesize that a thin
layer of printed protein can be formulated to promote migration of endogenous CECs while maintaining a
cohesive interface with the underlying stromal layer through bio-orthogonal covalent crosslinks. The bilayer
construct will be evaluated in an ex vivo rabbit eye model to quantify the migration of endogenous CECs in
response to secreted signals from the encapsulated CSSCs. In Aim 3, we evaluate the translational potential of
the 3D-printed, bilayered corneal tissue in a preclinical rabbit model of keratoplasty. The rabbits undergo a 5.0-
mm keratectomy to excise a central corneal stromal scar and will be treated with the full bilayer construct, the
bilayer construct without CSSCs, and a monolayer construct without the engineered basement membrane.
Injured, untreated animals are negative controls, and the uninjured eye in each animal are positive controls."

enables the use of genetically encoded biosensors for functional imaging of biochemical processes, the utilization of a
wide range of protein analysis approaches (gel/blots/well-based/cell-based), and the preparation of samples for
downstream “omics” applications that can be completed by external IDeA cores. The IVAC will be equipped with
instrumentation that is currently unavailable in Maine (e.g. the Thermo Scientific CellInsight CX5, a high content
multiplexable quantitative imager for cellular/subcellular functional examinations, a QuantStudio5 384-well Real-Time
multiplexable PCR machine, and a Thermo iBright 1500FL 5-channel gel/blot imager for multiplex fluorescence
analyses), as well as existing shared resources that are currently not part of a research core. All equipment will be
consolidated into a centralized, newly renovated laboratory. Dr. Ling Cao, a successful alumnus of a previous COBRE
program, will serve as the Core Director and oversees the operation of the IVAC along with a full-time Core Manager and
a Staff Technician. To ensure high-quality services and scientific rigor, the IVAC will 1) establish series of standard
operation procedures, 2) design and implement new training programs for faculty, staff, and trainees, 3) be engaged in
method development/improvement, and 4) grow its collaborations with other core facilities within and outside of UNE.
While keeping RPLs as the IVAC’s priority, establishment of the IVAC will also improve UNE’s research capacity and
create a regional resource thus benefit investigators within and outside UNE. The IVAC will also work towards long-term
sustainability by implementing an efficient online management system, conducting regular evaluations, continuing
professional development, and increasing its regional and national visibility and reputation. In addition, UNE has
committed vital support to the future success of the IVAC, including renovation costs, matching funds for equipment
purchases and service contracts, and additional protected time for the Core Director. The following sequential steps are
outlined to enable us to establish the IVAC and accomplish its mission of enhancing research infrastructure and providing
quality services to support the research programs of the RPLs and other UNE investigators. Aim 1: Establish a functional
IVAC facility; Aim 2: Support RPLs to achieve their project goals through comprehensive services."
10771607,"Impaired wound healing increases the risks of infection and the development of chronic wounds, which can lead to
significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, as well as increased healthcare costs. For people with additional risk
factors for chronic wounds, such as aging, diabetes, and obesity, the failure of a wound to heal properly can be especially
dangerous and may lead to amputation and even death. Current therapeutic approaches for wound healing are often
inadequate because they do not address the underlying causes of impaired healing. If a wound is not healing properly
because of poor blood flow, simply applying a bandage or topical antibiotic will not solve the problem. Regenerative
medicine strategies, such as the use of stem cells, growth factors, and scaffolds, have the potential to revolutionize the
treatment of acute and chronic wounds by promoting the body's natural healing processes and improving tissue
regeneration. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for tissue repair and regeneration. Acute
inflammation plays a crucial role in the initial stages of wound healing, however chronic inflammation can impede wound
healing. Therefore, it is crucial to develop therapies that can modulate these processes in a precise and controlled manner
to promote optimal wound healing. However, the complexity of the interactions between cells, matrix, and
microenvironment during wound healing hampers the development of effective biomaterials for wound repair.
Experiments proposed here will investigate VEGFR signaling in engineered models of wound healing. Specific Aim 1
will use a novel engineered biopolymer to dissect the role of VEGFR1, a poorly understood growth factor receptor in both
endothelial cells, which contribute to blood vessel formation, and macrophages, which are involved in tissue repair and
inflammation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the biochemical events that contribute to cell-cell crosstalk between
endothelial cells and macrophages. Embedded in both aims is demonstration of the potential of elastin-like polymers to be
a supportive and instructive biomaterial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This proposal uses the powerful
dual approach of biomaterials development and characterization as both an end goal for clinical translation and a
biotechnological tool for unraveling the intricacies of cell signaling events."
10771608,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoporosis, or low bone mineral density, is a common disease of aging resulting in 2.3 million fractures every year with
an annual societal cost of over $57 billion. First-line treatments for osteoporosis preserve bone mineral density by
inhibiting resorption in osteoclasts, resulting in an overall decrease in bone resorption and turnover. The side effects
associated with anti-resorptive therapies commonly decrease patient compliance with treatment recommendations. The
few anabolic therapeutics available facilitate bone formation in the osteoblast, but are reserved for high-risk patients due
to their cost, subcutaneous administration route, and lack of long-term safety data. The identification of new therapeutic
targets will help facilitate the development of well-tolerated alternative therapies that build high quality bone. There
remain significant gaps in our knowledge of proteins regulating bone mineral density, through both bone formation and
resorption in the osteoblast and osteoclast, respectively. With a critical need for accessible anabolic bone therapies, a
greater understanding of signaling pathways regulating osteoblast differentiation and mineralization will help in
identification of new therapeutic targets facilitating bone formation. DOCK7 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor
known to regulate the Rho family of small GTPases. GTPases are molecular switches that activate cell signaling
pathways, controlling almost all cellular processes. This proposal presents exciting preliminary data demonstrating that
both global loss of DOCK7 and conditional deletion of DOCK7 in osteoblast progenitor cells leads to low bone mineral
density in vivo and decreases mineralization in vitro. These data suggest that DOCK7 is essential for the development of
normal bone mineral density and critical in regulating bone formation directly in the osteoblast. Furthermore, global loss
of DOCK7 results in a striking increase in osteoclast numbers, highlighting a role for DOCK7 in bone resorption. The
experiments proposed here will examine the mechanism by which DOCK7 controls bone metabolism in both the
osteoblast and osteoclast, exploring the novel molecular network of factors regulating bone remodeling using a
conditional deletion mouse model. Specific Aim 1 will examine the role of DOCK7 in mediating signals from
extracellular ligands critical to osteoblast function through small GTPases such as RAC1. We will also utilize an unbiased
approach designed to identify novel DOCK7 binding partners and regulatory networks associated with bone formation by
mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the role of DOCK7 in bone resorption in vivo
and in vitro in osteoclast culture. This proposal will use innovative approaches to explore mechanisms by which DOCK7
influences bone metabolism in order to establish a set of novel factors regulating bone mineral density. These factors will
be the subject of future work exploring their therapeutic potential to prevent debilitating fracture events associated with
osteoporosis."
10771609,"Summary
 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a hamartomatous disease that manifests in multiple organ systems. In TSC,
mutations in the TSC1/2 genes cause the hyperactivation of mTORC1, a central hub regulating cell signaling and
metabolism. mTORC1 hyperactivation results in upregulation of DNA/RNA, protein and lipid synthesis.
 Macropinocytosis is a highly conserved, actin-dependent endocytic process for the uptake of extracellular material,
including proteins and lipids. In proliferating cells macropinocytosis can deliver extracellular nutrients to the lysosome,
where they are processed into critical macromolecule building blocks. We have found that macropinocytosis is increased
six-fold in TSC2-deficient cells, and that tryptophan (an essential amino acid) stimulates this nutrient uptake mechanism.
In preliminary studies, we identified a novel role of tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway in
macropinocytosis. Interestingly, inhibition of the kynurenine pathway selectively inhibits the proliferation of TSC2-
deficient cells. Nutrient uptake via macropinocytosis in TSC2-deficient cells is poorly understood, representing an
important knowledge gap.
 Our central hypothesis is that mTORC1-hyperactive cells depend on macropinocytosis via the kynurenine pathway to
maintain enhanced anabolic metabolism and cell proliferation, and that inhibition of tryptophan catabolism via
kynurenine would lead to decreased cell proliferation and tumor formation in TSC and LAM.
The mechanistic link between mTORC1, kynurenine metabolism, and the therapeutic potential of targeting this novel
metabolic vulnerability will be addressed in two aims:
Aim 1: Identify the mTOR-driven mechanisms that regulate macropinocytosis in TSC and LAM.
Aim 2: Determine the in vivo impact of targeting the Kyn pathway in TSC.
 We will utilize cutting-edge metabolic and proteomic profiling to investigate the novel hypothesis that targeting the
kynurenine pathway inhibits macropinocytosis and triggers selective cell death in TSC2-deficient cells. We will then
perform sensitive nutrient tracing assays to investigate how the enhanced kynurenine catabolism via AHR/TDO/IDO
impacts the metabolism and survival of TSC2-deficient cells. Novel approaches of image-based high throughput drug
screening using FDA-approved compound libraries and cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics will be employed to study the
role of kynurenine in TSC2-dependent macropinocytosis. Importantly, we will test the therapeutic potential of inhibiting
tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway in established preclinical models of TSC."
10771610,"SUMMARY
For a long time, it has been known that there is a strong link between chronic pain and high levels of stress and anxiety.
High levels of stress are a risk factor for developing chronic post-surgical pain. It remains unclear if and how stress can
facilitate the transition from acute to chronic pain. In the periphery, pain is perceived by primary sensory neurons, whose
cell bodies reside in the dorsal root ganglia, where each sensory neuron is enveloped by satellite glial cells, a non-neuronal
support cell. Previous studies show that peripheral injury as well as stress may induce satellite glial cell (SGC) activation,
a phenomenon characterized by increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, changes in gene expression, and
release of pro-nociceptive signaling molecules. SGC activation has been linked to the development of mechanical
hyperalgesia and primary afferent sensitization in a variety of rodent models. Our objective is to characterize the how
stress and/or peripheral injury-induced satellite glial cell activation may modulate primary afferent sensitization and lead
to the development of prolonged ischemic muscle pain. To explore this, the proposed research will use novel mouse
model of stress based on loss of environmental enrichment (LEE). This model does not employ the potential confounder
of noxious physical stimulation. Our preliminary data shows that LEE induced stress results in mechanical hyperalgesia
before injury and increased pain-related behaviors after an ischemia with reperfusion injury (I/R). We hypothesize that
LEE+(I/R)-induced satellite glial cell activation induces peripheral sensitization via increased expression and
release of pro-nociceptive signaling molecules that may modulate the development of chronic pain after injury. We
will use RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, animal behavior and ex-vivo electrophysiology to characterize how SGC
modulate pain perception after I/R in the context of stress. Aim 1 Characterize the transcriptomic changes in I/R induced
SGC activation and the signaling molecules that mediate muscle afferent sensitivity in the presence or absence of stress.
Transcriptomic changes in activated satellite glial cells after injury, stress, or a combination of both have never been
thoroughly characterized. The proposed RNAseq experiments and bioinformatics analysis on these data will allow us to better
characterize how gene expression changes in SGCs mediates pain development. Aim 2 will explore how SGC activation impacts
the function of muscle primary sensory neurons. We will use a combination of behavior, ex-vivo electrophysiology, and
calcium imaging to determine the changes in muscle primary afferent function that are mediated by SGC activation after stress
and/or injury. The data from these studies will become the cornerstone of a research program focused on how stress facilitates
the transition from acute to chronic pain and the specific role that SGCs play in this process and will facilitate my transition
from an early stage investigator to a stablished independent researcher."
10771611,"Laboratory research space at the University of New England (UNE) Biddeford Campus is currently at capacity, impeding
new faculty recruitment and preventing the establishment of a new In Vitro Analytical Core (IVAC) facility necessary to
support COBRE Research Project Leaders. The UNE College of Osteopathic Medicine will vacate the gross anatomy
teaching laboratories located in the Alfond Center for Health Sciences (ACHS) on the Biddeford Campus when they
relocate to a new facility in Portland Maine in 2024. UNE will renovate the vacated gross anatomy laboratories to create
almost 5,000 square feet of research laboratory space in support of the Center for Cell Signaling Research (CCSR). The
renovated space will support the CCSR by housing the new IVAC, additional faculty PI laboratories, and the existing
Histology and Imaging Core. Relocating the Histology and Imaging Core facility from its current location in two separate
research buildings to one site that is adjacent to the IVAC will increase efficiencies and create key synergies between
these two research cores. It will also free up highly coveted research space in the Pickus Biomedical Research Center for
new CCSR faculty recruitment. Importantly, the COBRE Research Project Leaders (RPLs) will directly benefit from these
renovations; all four RPLs plan to utilize the IVAC and the Histology and Imaging Core in their research, with some
investigators relying exclusively on access to the shared cell culture faculty that will be created within the IVAC.
Significant institutional support has been committed to the Alterations & Renovations (A&R) plan. Construction is
already underway for the new College of Osteopathic Medicine building, ensuring the availability of the anatomy
laboratories for the proposed renovations. An architectural firm with expertise in laboratory design has been retained to
develop the schematic level plans included in this submission. A&R funds are requested to support the purchase of items
from the List of Allowable Major Equipment (e.g., laboratory fume hoods). Additional costs associated with the
renovations, including all demolition and construction, estimated at over $1,300,000, will be covered by UNE.
Renovations will include demolition followed by construction that includes new walls, flooring, plumbing, and electrical
work. Installation of allowable major equipment includes laboratory benches and casework, fume hoods, biological safety
cabinets, incubators, ice machine, and distilled water/purification system. The proposed renovations are critical for the
success of the CCSR, increasing space for core research facilities as well as individual laboratories. Cell culture rooms
located within the IVAC will greatly increase capacity for conducting experiments proposed by the Research Project
Leaders. Locating the IVAC and Histology and Imaging Core in contiguous space allows for greater efficiencies, access
and oversight of sensitive instrumentation. The creation of individual research laboratories will allow for the recruitment
of new research active faculty. The decision by UNE’s president to seize the opportunity created by the imminent move of
the medical school to renovate the gross anatomy labs in support of a new COBRE demonstrates a clear commitment to
building research capacity."
10772055,"Project Summary/Abstract
Macropinocytosis, or “cell drinking,” is central to several macrophage functions including wound healing,
antigen presentation, and resolution of inflammation. However, there are large gaps in the mechanistic
understanding of this process. The long-term goal of this project is to identify novel mediators and cellular
mechanisms of macropinocytosis. The overall objective is to investigate how macrophages regulate actin
dynamics, phosphoinositide signaling and macropinocytotic efficiency in response to pro- and anti-
inflammatory stimuli. The central hypothesis is that the balance of SHP1 phosphatase and SYK kinase activity
optimizes the macrophage “actin economy” for macropinocytosis or other actin-dependent processes
depending on the activation state of the cell. This hypothesis stems from preliminary CRISPR/Cas9 whole
genome screen data produced in the applicant's laboratory indicating that SHP1 and SYK are key regulators of
macropinocytosis. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of
SYK/SHP1 balance on actin dynamics and phosphoinositide signaling at forming macropinosomes; and 2)
Determine how ITAM and ITIM containing immune receptors modulate macropinocytosis via the SHP1/SYK
balance in resting and activated macrophages. Under the first aim, an already proven live-cell imaging
approach established by the applicant will be used to image actin and phosphoinositide dynamics in wildtype
or CRISPR/Cas9 gene-disrupted primary murine macrophages with resting, inflammatory, or anti-inflammatory
activation states. Under the second aim, mechanisms of SHP1 and SYK activation by recruitment to immune
receptors will be tested using fluorescent protein chimeras of SHP1 or SYK in wild type or gene-disrupted
macrophages in response to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory stimuli. This approach is innovative because
the hypothesis was generated from novel mediators of macropinocytosis identified by a CRISPR/Cas9 whole
genome screen. Furthermore, this strategy uses targeted gene disruptions in combination with cellular
fluorescent probes and advanced live-cell microscopy techniques for three-dimensional live-cell imaging of the
spatiotemporal dynamics of actin polymerization and phosphoinositide signaling during macropinocytosis. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to expand the understanding of novel mechanisms
macropinocytosis and the role of macropinocytosis in inflammation. Ultimately, such knowledge has the
potential to identify therapeutic targets for modulation of macropinocytosis efficiency and the treatment of
inflammatory diseases such as chronic wounds or auto-immune disorders."
10772057,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Properly patterned lymphatic vessels are critical regulators of fluid and cellular traffic to support an effective
inflammation and wound healing response. However, the mechanisms that govern lymphatic vessel patterning
are not fully understood, and new therapeutics are needed to treat dysregulations of lymphangiogenesis, for
example in neovascularized corneal transplant rejection, lymphedema, and tumor-associated
lymphangiogenesis. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop lymphatic-targeted strategies to
promote wound healing and prevent or reverse refractory inflammation. In the course of work examining
lymphatic vessel pathology, the current investigators recently identified primary cilia on lymphatic endothelial
cells in vitro and in vivo. In other cell types, this organelle is a hub of cell signaling and regulates cellular
processes such as proliferation, cell polarity, and migration. Preliminary data in knockout mouse models of
IFT20, an intraflagellar transport protein important for primary cilia function, show that loss of primary cilia
exacerbates lymphangiogenesis. This suggests that previously unappreciated primary cilia-dependent
mechanisms may complement and modulate canonical mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis regulation. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that unknown primary cilia signaling pathways negatively regulate
excessive lymphangiogenesis by suppressing sprouting, proliferation, and migration to form vasculature
appropriately tuned to local demand. This hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims: (1) Identify the
cellular mechanisms by which loss of primary cilia dysregulates lymphangiogenesis; and (2) Identify lymphatic
endothelial cell signaling pathways that are disrupted by loss of primary cilia. In aim 1, intravital imaging in
mice with IFT20 knockout and tdTomato reporter fluorescence along with in vitro lymphangiogenesis assays
will be used to identify the timing and extent of dysregulation of specific lymphatic endothelial cell activities that
comprise a functional lymphangiogenesis response, such as sprouting, cell-cell junction organization, and
chemotaxis. In aim 2, two next generation sequencing technologies, RNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomics, will
be used in combination with pathway analysis and gene ontology strategies and rational hypothesis-driven
prioritization of hits to identify candidate primary cilia-dependent regulators of inflammation-associated corneal
lymphangiogenesis. Candidates will be validated in vitro in CRISPR knockout lymphatic endothelial cell lines.
The combination of intravital imaging, transcriptomics, gene editing, and a panel of in vitro lymphangiogenesis
assays is an innovative strategy to comprehensively interrogate the cellular mechanistic basis of primary cilia
regulation of lymphangiogenesis. The proposed project is significant because it will provide the first
mechanistic insight into primary cilia function in lymphatic endothelial cells with the potential to provide novel
therapeutic targets to control lymphangiogenesis as well as a framework for study of primary cilia regulation of
other lymphatic remodeling events. This work may open a new frontier for the field of lymphatic vessel biology."

10772113,"Project 1 Summary
Basic and pre-clinical research provides convincing evidence that estrogens exert neuroprotective effects in
the hippocampus, a brain area critical for memory and vulnerable to effects of aging and Alzheimer’s disease.
Thus, expectations were that menopausal hormone therapy would be neuroprotective and decrease the risk of
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in women. However, the benefits of hormone therapy on the brain
and cognition are unresolved. Whereas preclinical research is primarily conducted in models of healthy aging,
clinical research often includes subjects with diverse health status. To reconcile this evidence gap, we will
determine impacts of cardiometabolic status on the ability of estrogens to beneficially impact the hippocampal
memory system. Our central hypothesis is that in aging females, cardiometabolic disease, due to associated
dysfunction of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, disrupts the ability of estrogens to regulate levels of ERα in
the hippocampus, regulation that is necessary for estradiol treatment to exert lasting positive effects on
memory during aging. The hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: 1) determine if individual
differences in the response to midlife estradiol treatment on the hippocampal memory system are associated
with individual differences in cardiometabolic health; 2) determine if estradiol effects on the hippocampal
memory system in aging females are impacted by obesity and impaired glucose regulation; and 3) determine if
estradiol effects on the hippocampal memory system in aging females are impacted by cardiovascular disease.
Experiments under the first aim will use a longitudinal study design and a rat model of midlife estradiol use—in
which estradiol is administered either immediately after the cessation of ovarian function or after a delay—to
assess relationships between measures of body fat accumulation, glucose regulation, cardiovascular function,
hippocampal function, and memory from middle to old age. Experiments under the second aim will expose
middle-aged female rats to a high-fat or control diet before or after the initiation of midlife estradiol treatment
and a) assess the ability of midlife estradiol to exert effects on levels of hippocampal ERα, measures of
hippocampal function, and memory; and b) determine if increasing levels of hippocampal ERα differentially
affect memory and the hippocampus in aging females on high-fat or control diets. Experiments under the third
aim will use an angiotensin II-dependent hypertensive rat model to a) assess the ability of midlife estradiol to
exert effects on levels of hippocampal ERα, measures of hippocampal function, and memory; and b) determine
if increasing levels of hippocampal ERα differentially affect memory and the hippocampus in aging females
without or without hypertension. Results will determine under which conditions estrogen treatment provides
beneficial effects to the hippocampally mediated cognitive trajectory, a determination with implications for the
prevention or delaying of aging-associated memory disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias."
10772116,"Project 2 Summary
The menopausal transition is responsible for many of the cognitive impairments reported by women at midlife.
In addition to the detrimental effects of the natural loss of endogenous hormones on cognition, and as a probable
consequence, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and other related dementias is higher in women than men,
with double the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s disease at age 45. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment
for the vasomotor and sleep disruptions that accompany menopause, but timing of the intervention may have a
crucial impact on overall outcome, particularly on the preservation of cognitive capabilities. Whereas late
hormone therapy interventions have no benefit, or may even be harmful, early interventions seem to bestow
protection against cognitive decline, regardless of the presence of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. In addition,
cardiovascular and metabolic complications are directly associated with sharper cognitive decline, which
together with the loss of endogenous estrogens, may further increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease
and vascular dementia. While it has been described that hypertension and metabolic disease impair
neurovascular coupling—the fine-tuned mechanism that matches local blood supply with neuronal activity—it is
unknown if disrupted neurovascular coupling is ultimately responsible for the loss of cognitive protection by
estrogen. Given that the mechanisms governing neurovascular coupling are tightly regulated by endothelial nitric
oxide synthase, we believe that cardiometabolic comorbidities negatively impact the availability of nitric oxide to
the extent that it abolishes the estrogen-induced neuroprotection. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that
hypertension and metabolic disease prior to menopause impede the beneficial effects of hormone therapy in
preventing aging-related cognitive decline by blunting neurovascular coupling. This leads to impaired local
network activity, and therefore, to impaired synaptic plasticity required for the formation and stabilization of
synapses needed to create functional cortical circuits and therefore for cognition. We will also test the hypothesis
that increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and nitric oxide bioavailability will eliminate the deficits
in neurovascular coupling. This study will determine that the preexistence of hypertension and obesity-induced
metabolic disease prior to ovariectomy nullifies the positive effects of midlife estradiol treatment on synaptic
plasticity and synaptic stabilization, impairing the ability of cortical circuits to store and manage information, and
will identify alterations in the cortical microcircuitry responsible for the deficient experience-dependent synaptic
plasticity. The study will also examine the role of mitochondria in disrupted neuronal activity and characterize the
molecular mechanisms mediating the impaired neurovascular coupling that is associated with the loss of
estrogen’s neuroprotective effects. Focusing on a cortical circuit that we can comprehensively study and
manipulate, this study will create foundational knowledge for the design and improvement of personalized or
precision interventions aimed to prevent or treat cognitive disturbances in postmenopausal women at risk for
Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia."
10772119,"Project 3 Summary
An unresolved and important question is whether estrogen’s protective effects on the brain and cognition are
attenuated or reversed during diseases such as hypertension. The goal of our overall Program Project is to
address this critical gap using preclinical rodent models of healthy and unhealthy aging to understand
estrogen’s impact on female cognitive aging. The experiments proposed in Project 3 contribute to this goal by
comparing the impact of estrogen on vascular health in models of healthy versus unhealthy aging and
complement the other Research Projects in both concept and approach. Our overall hypothesis is that
cardiovascular disease alters the estrogen receptor profile, disrupting the integration of estrogen’s
molecular signaling pathways and attenuating estrogen’s cardiovascular effects and downstream
protection from Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Aim 1 will determine the impact of
cardiovascular disease on the vascular response to hormone therapy. This aim utilizes the same middle-aged
Long-Evans rat model of postmenopausal hypertension and cognitive decline as Project 1 led by Dr. Jill Daniel
and builds upon our previous co-authored publication. Aim 2 will establish whether altered estrogen receptor
expression impacts the response to estrogen. These experiments utilize transgenic ERE-luciferase mice along
with mice lacking either ERα or GPER to grasp how cardiovascular disease alters each of these signaling
pathways to reduce estrogen’s protective effects. Aim 3 will assess the impact of hypertension versus arterial
stiffness on female cognition, dendritic plasticity, and neurovascular coupling and determine which
antihypertensive provides the greatest protection to the brain. This aim was designed in collaboration with Co-
Investigator Dr. Ricardo Mostany and utilizes his Thy-1 mouse line to directly assess central mechanisms that
are associated with cognitive decline. The successful completion of the aims proposed in Project 3 will address
critical gaps in our knowledge on the impact of menopausal hormone therapy, enable the development of novel
methods for early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease-induced cognitive decline, and provide
innovative strategies for improving menopausal hormone pharmacology to protect from Alzheimer’s disease
and vascular dementia."
10772120,"Project 4 Summary
Midlife obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) are risk factors for all dementias including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
vascular cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia. Loss of estrogens due to menopause results in decreased
energy expenditure and impaired glucose homeostasis, leading to increased prevalence of Type 2 DM.
Hypothalamic estrogen receptor signaling plays a role in the central regulation of energy homeostasis via
modulation of both liver glucose production and tissue glucose uptake. Systemic glucose homeostasis is largely
regulated by central autonomic circuits, and the risk of developing Type 2 DM is high if autonomic dysfunction is
present. Autonomic dysfunction, including suppression of parasympathetic tone accompanied by sympathetic
predominance and disruption of hypothalamic circuits involved in autonomic control of metabolism, has been
observed in patients with several forms of cognitive impairment including AD. It is therefore crucial to determine
cellular mechanisms that impair autonomic regulation of the liver and glucose homeostasis, and thus contribute
to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, while obesity, insulin resistance and DM are known to impair hippocampal
synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, there is a lack of comprehensive studies investigating the effects of
midlife estradiol treatment on hypothalamic neurons involved in the central regulation of glucose homeostasis
and on hippocampal function in the context of obesity. Our preliminary observations have revealed that estradiol
treatment improves glucose levels in ovariectomized (OVX) animals. In addition, liver-related neurons in the
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of high-fat diet (HFD) treated mice are more active and HFD interferes with insulin-
dependent suppression of excitatory neurotransmission in pre-sympathetic PVN neurons. Furthermore, estradiol
enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal neurons of middle-aged OVX animals. These findings led
to the central hypothesis that midlife estradiol treatment in OVX mice provides beneficial effects required to
maintain proper function of the brain-liver pathway, hippocampal LTP, a cellular correlate for learning and
memory, and hippocampus-dependent cognitive function, but these beneficial effects are attenuated in mice on
HFD due to insulin resistance. The proposed studies will determine the effect of midlife estradiol treatment on 1)
the cellular properties of preautonomic PVN neurons, 2) synaptic plasticity and cellular properties in the
hippocampus, and 3) glucose homeostasis and cognition in control and HFD mice. These studies may lead to
new strategies to improve glucose homeostasis during cognitive impairment as well as to a better understanding
of the effect of midlife estradiol treatment on hypothalamic and hippocampal function."
10746416,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcription of genes in eukaryotes involves the orchestration of dozens if not hundreds of proteins enabling
each step in RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription: initiation, elongation, and termination. These steps occur
dynamically on DNA templates packaged into chromatin and coincidentally with a host of cotranscriptional
events. The proposed studies broadly involve two main themes – Pol II initiation and Pol II elongation. The first
step in transcription, initiation, involves selecting a transcription start site (TSS). Promoters across eukaryotes
can have multiple TSSs and these can be used at a wide range of levels. This project will identify
comprehensively the determinants of TSS selection in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
establish the extent to which initiation is sensitive to altered Pol II catalytic activity in other eukaryotes, an
important test of distinct mechanisms for initiation in eukaryotes. Such studies utilize massively parallel
promoter assays and genome-wide analysis of TSS usage. After initiation occurs, cotranscriptional events run
the gamut from RNA processing encompassing capping, splicing, and RNA cleavage, to modification or
remodeling of template chromatin. This project will uncover how elongation by Pol II works at a fundamental
level and probe connections between Pol II and cotranscriptional splicing; when it occurs and how it is
controlled by Pol II elongation rate. The work proposed is uniquely positioned across a wide spectrum of
biology, from fundamental mechanisms of Pol II function, to how changes to Pol II result in changes to cellular
physiology. The primary S. cerevisiae model employed has several critical advantages to exploit for these
purposes – genetics on a scale difficult to match in other systems and amenability to structural and
biochemical analyses. Gene expression mechanisms will be probed at many scales, from determining roles of
individual amino acids in the Pol II active site that are essential for proper catalytic control, to the changes in
transcriptomes caused by distinct genetic or chemical perturbations. Unique among studies on Pol II
mechanisms, the coupling of Pol II structural analyses with deep mutational scanning of the Pol II active site
will provide novel insights for how these enzymes function and evolve. The conservation of Pol II and its
regulatory machinery support the pertinence of results obtained to every eukaryotic cell, including humans
where we now recognize a complex syndrome linked to mutations in the large subunit of Pol II itself."

with history of TBI, including Veterans 65 and older, and healthy older adults.
Relevance and significance to Veteran’s health: TBI is prevalent among Veterans. Home-based telehealth
(HBT) may be an effective tool to address lack of access to health care for aging Veterans.
Aim 1: Complete adaptation of the IP-GOALS protocol for a) HBT use and b) use with older Veterans via
collection of feedback from [n=8] Veterans 65+ with history of TBI and cognitive complaints. Aim 2: Examine
the feasibility (defined as recruitment yield, dropout after randomization, retention, and adherence) and
participant-rated acceptability of [IP and] HBT-GOALS in n=36 Veterans 65+ with history of TBI and cognitive
complaints. Hypothesis 2: Feasibility will be demonstrated by achieving targeted recruitment goals with
reasonable rates of dropout after randomization, retention, and adherence, and high levels of participant-rated
acceptability in both groups. Aim 3: Estimate effect sizes for [HBT-GOALS and IP-GOALS using a double-
baseline control] on improving a) cognitive performance and self-reported b) emotional regulation and c) daily
functioning in the same Aim 2 study cohort to inform sample size requirements for a future clinical trial.
Hypothesis 3: Effect size estimates will provide evidence of clinically meaningful improvement on a) cognitive
functioning (Attention and Executive Function Composite), b) emotional regulation (Profile of Mood States
Total Mood Disturbance Score), and c) daily functioning outcomes (Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory Total
Score). Exploratory analysis a) will examine whether Veteran characteristics (e.g., age, sex, family/caregiver
support, distance to nearest clinic, and health/mobility issues including chronic pain) are associated with
differences in participant-rated acceptability and feasibility (i.e., recruitment yield, dropout after randomization,
retention and adherence), and [response to IP/HBT-GOALS vs. double baseline control.] Exploratory
analysis b) will examine distribution of responses to select criteria to define responders in future studies.
Methods: Adaptation phase (Aim 1): Adaptation of the existing GOALS protocol for a) HBT use and b) use
with older Veterans will be completed by collecting post-training feasibility and acceptability data. Pilot phase
(Aims 2 and 3 and Exploratory Analyses): Feasibility, acceptability, cognitive, emotional, and daily functioning
data will be collected from n=36 Veterans 65 or older before (baseline and delay baseline) and after
participation in GOALS training delivered in person (IP) or via HBT. Veterans will be randomly assigned to IP
or HBT. Outcome measures include participant-rated acceptability; feasibility (i.e., recruitment yield, dropout
after randomization, retention, and adherence); standardized and validated measures of neurocognitive
functioning; self-report of symptoms of depression, PTSD, mood disturbance, and daily functioning
Innovation: The proposed study is the first to investigate implementation of an established cognitive
rehabilitation intervention for use with aging Veterans with history of TBI and delivery via in-home
videoconferencing technology.
Implications: This research may promote improved daily functioning for aging Veterans with history of TBI
through rehabilitation of executive function, and increase access to such treatment."
10746419,"KRAS is one of the most deadly, yet undrugged, cancer proteins and is present in over 30% of all human
tumors, with even higher frequencies found in pancreatic, lung, thyroid, colon, and liver cancers. Thus, achieving
new mechanistic insights into KRAS deregulation and advancing innovative approaches to neutralize oncogenic
KRAS remain among the highest priorities of the cancer field and represent the focus of this interdisciplinary
proposal. KRAS is a GTPase that serves as a critical control point for a host of cellular functions ranging from
cell survival and proliferation to endocytosis and motility. The functional activity of KRAS is dictated by nucleotide
exchange, with the GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms representing the on and off states, respectively. Cancer
cells hijack and enforce the activated state of KRAS through gain-of-function mutagenesis or gene amplification.
To date, small molecule approaches to directly block the GTP-binding site have been unsuccessful due to
subnanomolar engagement of GTP and GDP by KRAS. The structure of KRAS in complex with SOS1, a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor that enhances KRAS activity by facilitating GDP release, revealed a helix-in-groove
interaction potentially targetable by α-helical mimicry. We applied all-hydrocarbon peptide stapling to generate
stabilized alpha-helices of SOS1 (SAH-SOS1) and identified a prototype compound that engaged oncogenic
KRAS, including the broad diversity of clinical mutants, inhibited the ERK-MAP kinase phosphosignaling cascade
downstream of KRAS, and impaired the viability of KRAS-driven cancer cells. We found that not only did the
prototype SAH-SOS1 construct dissociate the catalytic SOS1/KRAS interaction as anticipated, but also directly
and independently blocked nucleotide association with KRAS by an unknown mechanism. Here, we aim to apply
chemical, structural, cellular, and in vivo approaches to interrogate just how a SAH-SOS1 peptide can directly block
the enzymatic activity of KRAS, compare and contrast this mechanism to the natural agonist activity of the SOS1
protein, and thereby inform both our structure-function understanding of SOS1/KRAS regulation and a new strategy
for therapeutic inhibition of KRAS in human cancer. To achieve these goals, we propose three experimental aims:
(1) Synthesize an expansive library of structurally-reinforced helices modeled after the KRAS-interaction domain
of SOS1 to identify the binding determinants and functional interactions with KRAS and its oncogenic mutants;
(2) Apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to elucidate the conformational effects of the SOS1
protein and SAH-SOS1 peptides on KRAS proteins and thereby define the mechanisms of enzymatic regulation;
(3) Advance optimized SAH-SOS1 inhibitors to cellular and in vivo testing in KRAS-driven cancers to validate
mechanism of action and therapeutic window, and provide proof-of-concept for clinical translation. By combining
the biochemical and mass spectrometry expertise of the Engen laboratory with the cancer chemical biology and
translational approaches of the Walensky laboratory, our goal is to provide new mechanistic insight into the
oncogenic KRAS pathway and inform a new modality to disarm it for therapeutic benefit in cancer."
11167942,"The opioid epidemic has disproportionately impacted the unhoused population with an overdose death
rate 20 times higher than that of the general population. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is
highly effective in saving lives, but unhoused individuals experience many structural barriers to
accessing treatment – stigmatization by healthcare providers, limited acceptance of Medicaid, and
personal instability that precludes treatment co-requirements. Those barriers are compounded for
unhoused individuals in Montana (MT) where the number of Montanans with opioid use disorder (OUD)
outweigh treatment capacity by 10-fold with 92% of individuals with OUD (housed and unhoused) not
receiving treatment. To combat these barriers, we will utilize three evidence-based interventions proven
to increase engagement of underserved populations: 1) MOUD care based in syringe service programs
(SSPs), 2) a nurse-led model of MOUD, and 3) peer navigator supported care. We will embed these
interventions into the five SSPs that span the state of MT – sites located in both urban and rural areas
with three sites adjacent to American Indian Reservations. Following the OUD cascade of care
framework, we will assess the following measures among SSP clients: 1) engaged in care services at SSP,
2) OUD diagnosis by SSP prescriber, 3) MOUD initiations, 4) patient days on MOUD, and 5) MOUD for ≥
60 days, 90 days, and 180 days. In each SSP, we aim to surpass the state average of Montanans utilizing
MOUD. In whole, we intend to make these SSPs the state model for equitable OUD care."

In response to viral infection or vaccination, antigen(Ag)-specific CD8 T cells that are present at low
frequencies undergo rapid clonal expansion. While the majority of activated CD8 T cells become terminally
differentiated effector T (T ECF) cells following expansion and die after Ag clearance, a small fraction of them
persists as memory cells (Tr,1er,:) that contribute to long-term protection. However, it remains incompletely
understood how cell-extrinsic stimuli through TCR and cytokine receptors establish the gene regulatory
networks that determine the fates of activated CD8 T cells. The overall goal of this grant is to dissect the
molecular and cellular mechanisms by which TCR and IL-2R signaling cooperatively regulates CD8 T cell
differentiation through the control of the critical transcription factor TCF-1 encoded by Tcf7_ We will test the
hypothesize that cooperative action between signals induced by antigen and IL-2, but not IL-15, specifically
during priming induces expression of a set of transcription factors and epigenetic changes at a transcriptional
silencer element in the Tcf7 locus. The establishment of stable Tcf7 repression requires the stimulationresponsive
enhancement of IL-2R signaling, which establishes steady the TEFF- or T MEM-specific gene
regulatory circuitry that can be stably maintained after the inducing cell extrinsic stimuli decays as immune
responses resolve or become equilibrated. These studies will provide insights into the long standing question
of the molecular mechanisms of CD8 T cell differentiation and potential application to programming improved
immunotherapies."

10747418,"Abstract
 In the U.S., there are currently 22.7 million people living with asthma with a large cost to society estimated
at $89 billion. Environmental exposures have been identified as playing a role in asthma etiology and lung
function growth and the relationship with air pollution exposure is well established in more urban areas. Pesticide
exposure has also been related to asthma and decline in lung function in workers. In the Center for the Health
Assessment of Mothers And Children Of Salinas (CHAMACOS) Study, a longitudinal study of Latino farmworker
families in Salinas California, we observed that early life exposure to several pesticides, as measured by
biomarkers or residential proximity to agricultural use, were associated with childhood asthma and poorer lung
function at age 7. It is unknown if these relationships persist into adulthood. Few studies have examined the
impact of exposure to mixtures of pollutants such as particulate matter and pesticides. Methylation of DNA from
nasal cells has been related to asthma and airway inflammation and there is evidence of differential methylation
with exposure to pollutants, suggesting a possible link between environmental exposures and respiratory health.
 The long-term goal of our research is to identify modifiable factors related to respiratory health in a birth
cohort that has reached young adulthood. We will leverage the unique CHAMACOS prospective birth cohort
study to address these questions. Participants are currently 21 years of age and 500 participants still live near
the Salinas Valley, and 250 completed lung function testing at 7 years of age. Our objectives in this proposal are
to determine whether early life exposure to pesticides continue to impact their respiratory health in adulthood,
identify the relative importance of pesticide and air pollution exposures, periods of susceptibility (prenatal, early
life and childhood/adolescence), factors that modify these relationships and potential mechanisms involving the
methylation of nasal cells. We hypothesize that higher exposure to pesticides and air pollutants in early life will
result in poorer respiratory health and that DNA methylation will be a biomarker of these relationships. We will
conduct spirometry testing at 22y and estimate pesticide exposure using California’s unique Pesticide Use
Report data for the prenatal, early life (0-3y), childhood/adolescence (4-20y) and recent (previous year) periods.
We will estimate exposure to particulate matter air pollution by combining remote sensing and air monitoring
data. We will measure methylation in DNA collected from nasal swabs. We will assess whether associations
observed in the CHAMACOS cohort between pesticide exposure and respiratory health at 7y persist into early
adulthood and determine associations of exposure to a mixture of pesticides and particulate matter with
respiratory symptoms, asthma, allergy, and lung function. We will characterize associations of DNA methylation
with environmental exposures and respiratory health. In this study, we expect to identify the most important
exposures and periods of exposure related to adverse respiratory health. Our findings will help inform future
policies related to pesticide use and air quality designed to protect respiratory health."

 The abuse of stimulants such as methamphetamine (METH) exacerbates the deleterious effects of HIV
infection. Here, we will carry out single nucleus RNA-Seq with the goal of identifying cell types and cell states
that are pivotal in the effects of HIV and chronic methamphetamine (METH) self-administration on key brain
regions relevant to the effects of persistent HIV infection and METH use disorder in HIV transgenic (Tg) rats,
which harbor a non-replicating HIV-1 transgene and express chronic low-levels of multiple HIV-1 proteins. The
occasional but limited use of a drug is clinically distinct from escalated drug use, which is characterized by the
emergence of chronic compulsive drug-seeking and taking. Thus, we will use an established, state-of-the-art
paradigm of voluntary intravenous drug self-administration under long access (LgA) conditions that leads to
escalated (compulsive) METH intake in comparison to self-administration under short access (ShA) conditions,
which leads to a moderate and stable pattern of METH intake. The paradigm of escalated drug intake under
LgA conditions is highly relevant to the human substance use disorder (SUD) as it models all 7 of the criteria
for drug addiction in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and 7 of the 11 criteria
in the DSM-V. We showed that HIV Tg rats self-administering METH in this paradigm display increased
compulsivity, neuroinflammation, and neural injury. The project will address the following vexing question about
persistent HIV infection in the CNS: what are the cell types and cell states that drive neuroinflammation,
neurodegeneration, and compulsive METH abuse in the setting of HIV that can reveal the pathogenic
mechanisms behind neuroHIV disease progression, virus expression and persistence? The overarching
hypothesis behind the present project is that the exploration of the gene regulatory network at the single cell
level will elucidate key mechanisms that underlie the effects of HIV and METH abuse and their detrimental
interactions on neuroHIV disease progression, virus expression, and virus persistence and will indicate novel
therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and compulsivity to take METH. To test this
hypothesis, we will use a validated systems biology strategy for the reconstruction and interrogation of
genome-wide gene regulatory networks to identify the gene network dysregulations associated with the effects
of HIV, compulsive METH use, and their interactions at single cell resolution gene profiling by single nucleus
RNA-Seq. Overall, this collaborative interdisciplinary proposal integrating single cell level transcriptomics,
state-of-the-art behavior methods in HIV Tg and wild-type rats, and computational strategies is expected to
identify novel mechanistic hypotheses that may lead to transformative new therapeutic concepts for substance
use disorder (SUD) in the HIV setting, and will establish key resources for the neuroHIV field to be made
publicly available through the SCORCH data coordination center."
10747974,"Project Summary – Project IV
 As hypertension develops, the forces exerted by blood pressure are applied to the vessels' structures
inducing pathological changes in the cellular components of the vasculature. These changes are well described
in cell populations of the vascular tunicas intima, media, and adventitia. However, there is a gap in our knowledge
of hypertension's impact on adipocytes and their progenitors in the fourth vessel layer, the tunica adiposa or
perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Adipocytes are the core cells of PVAT and are a crucial source of vasoactive
components that support blood pressure control. The central hypothesis of Project IV is that vascular mechanical
forces during hypertension limit the adipogenic capacity of adipocyte progenitors (AP) and enhance their fibrotic
responses, leading to PVAT dysfunction.
 Project IV will investigate the effects of vascular mechanical forces on PVAT function. In Specific Aim 1, we
will determine how these forces interact with the stiffness of the PVAT extracellular matrix to affect the adipogenic
potential of perivascular AP and govern their phenotype fate. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how the
adipogenic potential of perivascular AP cells is impacted by hypertension leading to an increase in their fibrotic
fate and a reduction in PVAT adipocyte populations. This project (IV) will provide unique mechanistic information
on PVAT's AP and adipocyte biology to support the development of 1) Project I, as these cells modify PVAT
stiffness and how the tunica adiposa adapts to vascular mechanical forces; and 2) Projects II and III, as
adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and fibrosis in PVAT respond to and modulate neurohumoral factors and immune
cells. We expect that elucidating the role of PVAT adipocyte progenitors and adipocytes as integrators of vascular
health will redefine the role of these cells in the pathogenesis and control of hypertension."
10780351,"Patients regularly have myocardial infarctions or strokes, despite being on treatment to lower low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure (BP). This residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) remains a substantial medical burden globally. To understand and control residual ASCVD
risk, we need to answer three questions: (1) what are the underlying mechanisms? (2) who is at higher risk? (3)
are there new treatment options? Building on our experience, we propose to fill these knowledge gaps:
(1) The genetics of residual ASCVD risk remain largely unexplored. Existing genetic studies focus primarily on
baseline risk (e.g., risk of CHD) or response to CHD-relevant drugs (e.g., LDL-C change on statins), not the
residual ASCVD risk. Our group has previously identified and replicated LPA variants associated with residual
CHD events in patients on statin treatment independent of LDL-C change. In Aim 1, we will identify new users
of drugs to lower LDL-C or BP in the biobank at Vanderbilt (BioVU) and conduct a GWAS comparing those who
have an ASCVD event while on treatment to those without an event. We will conduct replication in eMERGE and
All of US (AoU) and construct polygenic risk scores. (2) There is a dearth of generalizable and accurate models
to predict residual ASCVD risk. Electronic health records (EHRs) contain granular, longitudinal, real-world data
that are inherently medically relevant. Additionally, large programs, such as AoU, collect information on lifestyle
(e.g., smoking) and social determinants of health (e.g., insurance and employment status). Recently, we applied
machine learning (ML) algorithms for CHD risk prediction on longitudinal EHR data and found that ML
outperformed the ACC/AHA risk equation for prediction of ASCVD. The performance was further improved
by including additional factors. In Aim 2, we will leverage longitudinal EHRs at Vanderbilt and apply advanced
ML method to construct prediction models for residual ASCVD risk. We will then validate the model in AoU
and eMERGE, and improve the performance by including genetic, environmental, and social information. (3)
There are few drug therapies to reduce ASCVD risk other than ones to lower LDL-C and BP. Recent advances
in genetics, informatics, and large real-world clinical datasets provide opportunities for systematic drug
repurposing. Our group recently pioneered a new drug-repurposing approach. We first leveraged existing GWAS
to impute genetically determined transcriptome signatures (the virtual transcriptome) associated with elevated
LDL-C or raised BP. We then screened the transcriptome signature in a drug perturbation database to identify
candidate drugs, followed by validating them in real-world clinical data. In Aim 3, we will conduct drug
repurposing for residual ASCVD risk. We will use two approaches: (a) impute the genetically determined
transcriptome and (b) large-scale Mendelian randomization. We will validate the identified candidate drugs in
Medicare and AoU. These studies will have potential high impact for residual ASCVD risk by identifying: (1)
underlying mechanisms; (2) patients at higher risk; and (3) novel drugs to reduce residual risk."
10932972,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gynecologic malignancies such as ovarian cancer (OvCa) are among the deadliest cancers affecting women
due to therapy resistance and limited understanding of disease etiology and risk. An under-explored risk factor
is Wnt ligand WNT4, which is central to ovarian organogenesis. Over 20 studies link WNT4 polymorphisms
with increased risk for gynecologic pathologies; one polymorphism at a key WNT4 regulatory site (rs3820282)
is associated with 10-25% increased risk for OvCa, but the mechanism(s) is unknown. Our work links WNT4 to
cancer cell growth, metabolism, and therapy resistance. We find WNT4 over-expression is sufficient to mediate
chemotherapy resistance in vitro, and resistance with increased metastatic outgrowth in vivo, and that WNT4
expression is strongly induced in OvCa cells surviving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Importantly, the rs3820282
variant allele in the WNT4 regulatory site creates a binding site for nuclear receptor-class transcription factors.
CRISPR knock-in of the rs3820282 variant in mice increases Wnt4 expression in gynecologic tissues.
Accordingly, in a protein array study of more than 100 OvCa tumor tissues, we found that AMPK activation and
downstream signaling were increased in variant allele tumors. Conversely, glucose metabolism proteins were
increased in wild-type tumors and inversely correlated with AMPK signaling, suggesting WNT4 genotype
underpins metabolic remodeling. These observations suggest that the rs3820282 variant activates WNT4 to
drive cancer phenotypes. However, the rs3820282 variant allele frequency (VAF) is widely divergent across
ethnic populations, occurring at ~0% in African populations, ~15% in Caucasians, 20-40% in Latinx
populations, and 45-55% in Asian populations, paralleling high incidence of aggressive, treatment-resistance
OvCa subtype clear cell carcinoma (CCC) in Asian populations. Our goal is to determine how rs3820282
mediates disparities in ovarian cancer outcomes, mechanistically define genotype-driven tumor etiology, and
identify therapies to exploit dependence on WNT4. Toward this goal, we will: 1) define how the rs3820282
variant activates WNT4-dependent metabolic remodeling; 2) define rs3820282-driven tumorigenesis and
therapeutic response in a model of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC); 3) determine how rs3820282 genotype
impacts outcomes for patients with OvCa. With a foundation of rigorous supporting data from human
specimens, we will undertake highly mechanistic studies to define the contribution of this common
polymorphism to a cancer disparity, tumor metabolic reprogramming, gynecologic tumorigenesis, treatment
response, and patient outcomes. We will leverage cutting-edge global metabolomics, tumorigenesis modeling,
and human survival studies. Our approach can define the genotype-to-phenotype link, determine how this SNP
drives OvCa cancer disparities, and identify approaches to exploit the underlying biology."

COMMUNITY OUTREACH & ENGAGEMENT
Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) serves West Central Florida, a 15-county region of 6.1 million residents. Moffitt
covers a large, mainly urban, geographic area with a population mirroring the U.S. in race/ethnicity, foreign-born
status, and Spanish language preference. Recognizing the need to formalize, harmonize, and expand the scope
of our longstanding commitment to serve the community, Moffitt established the Office of Community Outreach,
Engagement & Equity (COEE) in 2018 under the leadership of Associate Center Director (ACD) of COEE, Susan
Vadaparampil, PhD, MPH, MHSE. Moffitt patient and community-focused advisory boards (CABs), in
combination with catchment area geography, sociodemographic characteristics, and vulnerable populations, are
foundational to COEE’s organizational and engagement structure. Community-defined needs include cancer
prevention and screening, access to care, clinical trials education, and a focus on populations experiencing
cancer-related health disparities. Further, compared to Florida and the United States, there is a higher incidence
of lung, melanoma of the skin, ovarian, oropharynx, and cervix cancers in the catchment area, as well as poor
uptake of health behaviors that reduce risk of these cancers (e.g., HPV vaccination). COEE rigorously evaluated
the intersection of community needs, cancer burden, and related risk factors. In collaboration with the CABs,
catchment area priorities were developed to reduce the burden of cancers that are tobacco-related, caused
by ultraviolet exposure, amenable to screening modalities for genetic risk or early detection, preventable by
vaccine, and/or that have excess mortality in vulnerable populations. Collectively, COEE activities that address
these priorities are organized into three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To assess, prioritize, and monitor catchment area needs across the cancer continuum.
Aim 2: To catalyze innovative research and clinical trials responsive to catchment area priorities.
Aim 3: To accelerate the adoption of evidence-based practices through outreach, partnerships, and policy to
address catchment area priorities.
COEE efforts have led to highly impactful catchment area-relevant science in all five research Programs. For
example, COEE created two community-engaged pilot grant mechanisms that funded eight studies between
2018-2020. COEE also supported the opening of Moffitt’s first clinical trial for Persons Living with HIV, a
vulnerable population in our catchment area. Importantly, from 2016-2020, Moffitt provided over 8,000 free
cancer screenings and cancer education to over 56,000 community members. Finally, a key example of our
policy efforts is work that led to the coverage of cutting-edge CAR T-cell therapy by Medicare. In summary,
COEE has rapidly become an integral part of the community and Moffitt’s culture through a community
engagement structure that is built upon mutual trust and respect. Going forward, this exceptional foundation will
allow Moffitt to work with our community to effectively reduce cancer burden in our catchment area and beyond."

The purpose of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) is to provide a comprehensive, multi-
disciplinary resource of expertise in biostatistics and bioinformatics. Members of the BBC will collaborate
closely with investigators from each project in translating their hypotheses into testable statistical hypotheses
and address the corresponding aims at all levels of investigation. This consists of designing basic and animal
experiments, managing and maintaining the resulting data, data analysis and statistical and bioinformatics
inference, and formulating new hypotheses based on discoveries arising from exploration and visualization of
the integrated data. The BBC serves as a focal point from which investigators may draw statistical and
bioinformatics expertise for planning, management and analysis of their studies. It also develops, tests and
implements various techniques of statistical analysis, including mathematical modeling, applicable to cancer
research. Types of research supported include basic science and translational research. The large volume of
information to be generated in the proposed research projects and cores requires computer-based tools for the
coordination of efforts and the management of data. The primary role of the BBC will be to establish a
centralized relational database system and data management structure that facilitates the entry, storage and
retrieval of all data generated by the program project, and permits the controlled exchange of information
across the several projects and cores. De-identified information will be available to all investigators associated
with this program project. Due to the sensitive nature of the information stored by this Core, we will take
extensive precautions to protect the confidentiality of participants. All IRB and HIPAA regulations will be strictly
enforced. By providing data access to investigators, sharing technical capabilities, and ensuring the quality of

CLINICAL PROTOCOL & DATA MANAGEMENT 
Clinical Protocol & Data Management (CPDM) provides comprehensive support for Moffitt Cancer Center 
(Moffitt) investigators that facilitate development and testing of new treatments, prevention strategies, supportive 
care, diagnostics, and biomarkers to translate them to the point of patient care. CPDM provides support through 
a talented centralized team that oversees the design, development, and conduct of interventional and 
observational trials; trial safety and compliance; data quality; personnel education; and appropriate accrual of 
women, minorities, and persons across the lifespan. CPDM activities are organized into four Specific Aims: 
Aim 1: To support investigators in development, implementation, and conduct of innovative cancer clinical 
studies, with a particular emphasis on investigator-initiated trials (IITs) 
Aim 2: To ensure safety and compliance through timely monitoring, audits, and committee oversight 
Aim 3: To provide comprehensive clinical research training and education, along with ongoing quality assurance, 
to meet the highest standards of research data and study patient care 
Aim 4: To facilitate appropriate inclusion of women, minorities, persons across the lifespan, and other 
underserved populations in clinical research studies 
Progress has included accruing 16,321 patients to interventional trials and 5,716 to treatment trials, representing 
a 38% increase in total trial interventional accruals since the previous reporting period. As a result of a 36-point 
clinical research action development plan, treatment accruals increased by 25% in FY2020 as compared to 
FY2015. Safety and compliance for these trials is overseen by the Protocol Monitoring Committees and is 
coordinated by the CPDM team under a revised NCI-approved Data & Safety Monitoring Plan. 
Moffitt has diligently worked to increase accruals of women, minorities, and persons across the lifespan through 
its Minority Clinical Research Committee by: 1) establishing a committee called Reaching & Engaging Special 
Populations to Expand Clinical Trials (RESPECT); 2) increasing minority community outreach and clinical 
research education events; and 3) establishing Moffitt-led trials at affiliate sites. These efforts resulted in 
Hispanic/LatinX accrual of 39.3% interventional and 7.8% treatment and African American/Black accrual of 6.3% 
interventional and 5.9% treatment, with plans to further increase inclusion. During the reporting period, 48% of 
patients accrued were women, which is similar to patients seen at Moffitt. Moffitt primarily serves adult patients. 
Age at time of accrual ranged from 18 – 94 (with 52% among being populations >65), ensuring that individuals 
across the lifespan participate in clinical trials at Moffitt. Overall, CPDM supports Members engaging in high 
impact clinical research by providing key compliance, coordination, and clinical outreach services throughout the 
trial lifecycle, from protocol development to closeout, ensuring the conduct of rigorous and innovative 
interventional and observational trials that benefit patients in our catchment area and beyond."

As Center Director, Dr. Cleveland provides leadership and oversight of all of the research activities of Moffitt
Cancer Center (Moffitt), including setting the strategic vision and Research Strategic Plan (RSP); faculty
recruitment, development, retention and support (including focus on promotion and tenure and underrepresented
faculty); clinical trials and physician research protected time; and allocation of all resources and activities,
including staff, equipment and space. Dr. Cleveland deploys Developmental Funds to achieve the RSP and to
foster transdisciplinary science across Moffitt. Specifically, this includes Developmental Pilot Projects; Staff
Investigators for four Centers of Excellence whose mission is to support the research of all five CCSG Programs;
and an Early Stage Clinical Investigator. Developmental Funds are leveraged with institutional funds.
Developmental Funds: CCSG Developmental Funds are critical for realizing the RSP. These funds will be
deployed for Team Science projects ($100,000 per year) that foster high impact transdisciplinary, translational
science. These funds are leveraged with significant institutional funds that support these pilot projects, which
ultimately were the only category for which CCSG Developmental Funds were used. Notably this investment of
CCSG and institutional funds returned more than $27.4 million in peer-reviewed funding and 29 publications.
Staff Investigators: Moffitt’s Centers of Excellence build and foster transdisciplinary collaborations across all
Research Programs based on areas of institutional strength that align with the needs of the catchment area.

LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, & EVALUATION
Center Director Dr. John Cleveland, with the support of his senior leadership team, sets the scientific direction
of the Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) and oversees ongoing rigorous and inclusive planning and evaluation
processes. This led to development of a new Research Strategic Plan (RSP), changes in leadership structure,
revised Aims across all five research Programs, and restructuring/expansion of six Shared Resources previously
rated as Outstanding or Exceptional. Expanding on Moffitt’s mission “to contribute to the prevention and cure of
cancer,” the goal of the RSP is for Moffitt to be the best place for cancer science, recruiting and retaining the
best talent, out-competing for grant funding, and achieving international recognition for impact it has on changing
paradigms, clinical and public health practice, and policy. To accomplish this, RSP focuses on Catchment Area;
Health Disparities; Immuno-Oncology; Metabolism; Data Science; and Cancer Care Delivery, Prevention, and
Implementation Science through three pillars: Optimizing Intellectual Capability, Creating Fuel for Discovery, and
Generating Impact. With significant input from Program Leaders, all Members, and staff completed list of
objectives that was reviewed and prioritized by REX, who aligned research resources and determined priorities
to support the research Programs, including recruitment, mentoring, pilot funding, and collaboration.
Leadership, Planning, & Evaluation (LPE) incorporates the; 1) Research Executive Committee, which is
comprised of Dr. Cleveland and the 8 Associate Center Directors; 2) Scientific Leadership Committee, which
consists of 8 Program Leaders, 4 Center of Excellence Directors, and Research Department Chairs; 3) 8 SLC
subcommittees; 4) 14 Shared Resource Advisory Committees; 5) 2 Community Advisory Boards (CABs); 6)
External Advisory Committee (EAC); and 7) ad hoc internal or external advisors that are added as needed.
Importantly, this collaborative structure, organized by the following Specific Aims, led Moffitt through significant
leadership changes and the COVID-19 pandemic with an undiminished, and indeed accelerated, trajectory.
Aim 1: To develop, implement, and review a dynamic Research Strategic Plan that drives research and growth.
Aim 2: To consult external experts and leaders to evaluate progress and future research priorities.
Aim 3: To operate an effective planning and evaluation infrastructure that enhances efficiencies, and that fosters
collaboration, innovation, and strategic growth.
Over the past cycle, LPE impact included; development of the new RSP; creation of the COEE and RET Offices;
engaging successful leadership succession plans; revising the research Programs to enhance scientific impact;
restructuring/expanding six Shared Resources rated as Outstanding or better; recruiting 72 top-tier research
faculty; awarding pilot grants totaling $10.4M that led to $44.1 in external peer-reviewed funding ($47.4M total
funding); fostering 3,279 publications (24.2% intra- and 18.7% inter-programmatic) of which 543 were in high
impact journals; and stimulating 5,471 therapeutic intervention accruals (5,716 accruals including affiliates)."
10783711,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
PROTOCOL REVIEW & MONITORING SYSTEM 
Moffitt Cancer Center’s (Moffitt) Protocol Review & Monitoring System (PRMS) supports rigorous review and 
monitoring of clinical studies through: 1) First Stage review by 16 Disease Groups; 2) Second Stage review by 
six Scientific Review Committee (SRCs); and 3) policy and ongoing portfolio review by the Clinical Research 
Action Committee (CRAC). The PRMS oversees the continuum, including scientific review, study prioritization, 
study amendment, and scientific progress. The SRCs maintain full authority for opening and closing clinical 
studies at Moffitt, thereby ensuring that each study meets its scientific and accrual goals. To fulfill its roles, PRMS 
activities are organized into four Specific Aims: 
Aim 1: To establish and maintain scientific review committees with sufficient size and expertise to conduct critical 
and fair scientific reviews of cancer-related research studies involving human subjects. 
Aim 2: To conduct a thorough scientific review of all non-peer reviewed cancer-related clinical studies based 
on specific, pre-determined review criteria. 
Aim 3: To prioritize all clinical studies. 
Aim 4: To monitor scientific progress for all ongoing clinical studies. 
New leaders conducted a comprehensive review and reorganization of clinical research processes, which 
include: 1) a revised Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP); 2) enhancements of trial review (establishing 
Disease Groups and Clinical Leads and revamping Scientific Review Committees); 3) enhanced rigor in trial 
review and monitoring; and 4) redeveloped efforts to reduce time to trial activation. 
Over the period, PRMS reviewed 2,048 protocols and 1,362 amendments, including 434 interventional studies. 
642 studies (31% of all studies) were deferred or rejected in First Stage or Second Stage review. Additionally, 
663 interventional studies have been opened with an average activation time of 135 days in the last quarter prior 
to the implementation of clinical research revenue cycle project (CRRC, noted in CPDM to have delayed 
activation due to having to put activation projects on hold as it was completed). The CRRC project is expected 
to reduce time to activation when completed. 
During the award period, Moffitt established the first NCI-approved multi-institutional scientific review committee 
for the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN), a national alliance of 18 cancer centers. 
This SRC is hosted and managed by Moffitt’s PRMS and comprises members from all participating institutions. 
PRMS ensures highly impactful and rigorous clinical research by providing scientific review, prioritization and 
monitoring of clinical studies with broad expertise across all areas of cancer research. This ensures that clinical 
research conducted at Moffitt continues to drive groundbreaking advances in the care and understanding of 
cancer in our catchment area and beyond."

SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Shared Resource Management (SRM) facilitates exceptional science by Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt) Members
through state-of-the-art technologies and services provided by highly trained and specialized staff. Centrally
managed Shared Resources (SRs) are developed and deployed in support of the Research Strategic Plan and
to meet the current and future needs of Members. The 14 (including 2 developing) Moffitt SRs are: Analytic
Microscopy Core, Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cell Therapies Core, Chemical Biology Core,
Collaborative Data Services Core, Flow Cytometry Core, Quantitative Imaging Core, Molecular Genomics Core,
Participant Research Interventions & Measurements Core, Proteomics & Metabolomics Core, Small Animal
Imaging Lab, Tissue Core, the developing Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics Core, and the developing
Gene Targeting Core. These SRs are maintained by 224 faculty and staff that serve the needs of Members, with
each SR supporting cancer research that ranges from basic science to population wide association studies and
interventional trials. Moffitt collectively invested over $7.9M in capital equipment for the SRs, along with more
than $7M in annual operating costs, over each of the last five years. User surveys, and scientifically-driven
planning and continual rigorous evaluation of services and resources by SR Advisory Committees of Member
needs, impact, appropriate location, project handoffs, and expectations have ensured that the SRs keep pace
with the growing needs of Members and with state-of-the-art technologies. These processes led to restructuring
or expansion of six Shared Resources, each of which rated Outstanding or better in the prior review. SRM
supports Member research through four Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Provide high-value, cost-effective Shared Resources and project workflows to Members through
centralized management, processes and policies.
Aim 2: Plan and evaluate Shared Resources to meet the Research Strategic Plan and evolving scientific needs
of the Research Programs.
Aim 3: Ensure best practices, quality, and reproducibility of research through policies, education and training.
Aim 4: Determine and ensure scientific impact and value of Shared Resources through standardized usage
tracking, evaluation of key metrics, and financial oversight.
Shared Resource Management supports SRs that serve all 5 Programs and 183 Members in aggregate (117 of
whom hold peer reviewed funding). Scientific impact is reflected in the support of $36.0M in active peer reviewed
funding and 482 peer reviewed grants, 494 clinical trials, and 883 unique publications since the last application,
including 126 publications in high impact journals (IF ³ 10). Overall centralized SRM provides state-of-the-art
resources and services to Moffitt’s research community that efficiently and effectively fosters cutting-edge

The VIVA Clinical Core B provides the infrastructures needs to support standardized approaches for
the recruitment, longitudinal retention and clinical characterization of human subjects enrolled in
observational studies. The Core B will facilitate patient centered research through activities and
services such as access to populations of people who a) were infected with SARS-CoV-2, influenza
virus or dengue virus, b) received immunization(s) for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and dengue virus.
Participant derived biological specimen and corresponding clinical information will be collected in
domestic as well as international settings. The Core B will continue with longitudinal follow-up of the
enrolled participants, lead recruitment of new participants with acute infections by viral pathogens of
interest. It will direct the biospecimen collection, banking at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

The goal of the Immune Phenotyping Core (Core C) is to provide tools and reagents to the different projects
that will be used to characterize the immune responses induced by vaccinations and infections with
coronaviruses, influenza viruses and dengue viruses. The Core will leverage existing state-of-the-art
serological techniques established in the Krammer laboratory, as well as multiplex analysis of cytokine and
chemokine plasma profile and Cytek Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometry profiling of PBMCs and human tonsillar
histocultures (HC) currently used and optimized in the Fernandez-Sesma laboratory. The following aims re
proposed: Aim 1: Characterization of antibody responses to coronavirus, influenza virus and dengue
virus vaccination and infection. The Core will provide assays, reagents and protocols to measure binding
and functional antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 for Project 1 and influenza viruses for Project 2.
Additionally, the secretion of IgM, IgG and IgA in the supernatant of human tonsil histocultures (HC) treated
with the different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines types (Project 1), influenza virus vaccines and viruses (Project 2) will
be assessed. Aim 2: Characterization of cytokine/chemokine responses to coronavirus, influenza virus
and dengue virus vaccination and infection. The Core will analyze the levels of cytokines and chemokines
in the plasma of vaccinated/infected individuals and the supernatant of human tonsil histocultures treated with
different vaccines for Projects 1, 2 and 3. Aim 3: Characterization of cellular responses to coronavirus,
influenza virus and dengue virus vaccination and infection. Analysis of the cellular immune profiles of
PBMCs from vaccinated/infected individuals over time, using Spectral Flow cytometry. Human tonsillar HC will
be also analyzed by Cytek Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometry in order to capture early immune signatures and
changes in cell populations corresponding to adaptive immune responses in those HC after treatment with
different vaccines. We will obtain high-resolution data at the single-cell level to resolve the most challenging
cell populations including cells expressing viral antigens. PBMCs will also be subjected to a complementary
transcriptomics analysis by RNAseq conducted by the Genomics Core. These tools will serve to generate
immune signatures representative of the longitudinal immune responses to vaccination and/or infection in
study participants enrolled in observational non-interventional cohort studies in coordination with the Data
Management and Analysis Core (Core E). Data obtained using these immunological techniques will be
analyzed by the Data management and Analysis Core comparing them across the different systems used in
the projects as well as in combination with the genomic data obtained in the Genomics Core (Core D) from
the same samples. All data generated by the VIVA Projects and Cores, including the Immune Phenotyping

10783561,"The most prevalent primary brain tumor, glioblastoma, ranks among the most lethal of human cancers. The brain
tumor microenvironment (TME) is thought to play a critical role during tumor development and treatment
resistance. Unlike many other solid tumors, the glioblastoma TME is dominated by macrophages and microglia—
collectively known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are plastic in nature and can polarize
toward pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive states. Many lines of evidence suggest that immunosuppressive
TAMs dominate the brain tumor microenvironment, which fosters tumor development, contributes to tumor
aggressiveness, and impedes the therapeutic effect of various treatment regimens. Through the development of
new therapeutic strategies, TAMs can potentially be shifted towards a proinflammatory state to enhance anti-
tumor immunity. The promise of TAM-targeted therapy has not yet been realized, due in part to a limited
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TAM behavior and function. My postdoctoral work has
elucidated novel mechanisms that govern the polarization of TAMs in the glioblastoma TME. Notably, my
preliminary data suggests that targeting the CARD9/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex represents a
promising therapeutic approach to shifting the glioblastoma TAM phenotype to favor anti-tumor immunity.
The overall objectives of this application are to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate TAM
immunoreactivity in glioblastoma and to utilize this information to inform the development of new and effective
therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcomes. My central hypothesis is that CBM activation within
TAMs is required for glioblastoma-induced TAM polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype and this
CBM-dependent TAM polarization facilitates tumor growth, progression, and resistance to therapy. I first propose
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which glioblastoma cells communicate with TAMs to drive CBM
activation (Aim 1). Second, I will evaluate how CBM activity within TAMs influences TAM function (Aim 2).
Finally, during the R00 phase of this proposal I will investigate how inhibiting the CARD9-CBM complex in TAMs
in vivo affects glioblastoma tumor progression and responsiveness to standard therapies (Aim 3). Collectively,
these studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms governing the brain tumor immune
microenvironment of glioblastoma and inform the development of new approaches to manipulating this immune
microenvironment to improve treatment outcomes for glioblastoma. During the mentored K99 phase of this
award, I will greatly benefit from the expert mentoring world-class research resources available at the University
of Pittsburgh and the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. Completing the proposed project will allow me to build a
strong scientific foundation and then lead an innovative research program as an independent investigator.
Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for my timely transition to a successful career as a
multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in neuro-oncology."

in which the rate of data collection and the complexity of data sets have exceeded the ability of classically
trained scientists to extract and assimilate meaningful information. Today, This proposal is motivated by the
need to build this critical workforce of biologists armed with cross-disciplinary training in computational,
quantitative and analytical realms to harness the power of ‘Big Data’ in biomedical sciences and recognition
that demand for these trained scientists represents a unique opportunity to promote diversity, equity, and
inclusion in science. This training program at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) will be
administered by the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, a campus leader in medical and
graduate teaching that hosts key faculty serving as directors for data-rich core facilities such as next-
generation sequencing, bioinformatics and systems biology, and research information technology. The
proposed two-year training program derives from the natural synergy of this in-house expertise with two
department sponsored pre-doctoral graduate programs in Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology (MGCB) that
focuses on biological and disease mechanisms using high-throughput -omics approaches and Bioinformatics
and Systems Biology (BISB), which emphasizes on novel algorithm development and computational and
statistical training to advance design and analysis of big data experiments. The proposed program requests
funding for three pre-doctoral traineeships in the first year and six in the subsequent years with a two-year
trainee rotation. Participants will be selected concurrent with application to UNMC graduate programs and
matriculating students will receive training from preceptors representing 38 laboratories in 14 basic science
and clinical departments at UNMC and our sister campus, University of Nebraska Omaha. Trainees will take
courses in bioinformatics, statistical analysis, biological networks, and research design and scientific thinking to
provide a common skill set and language for interdisciplinary research. Workshops, seminars, and a team-
based project will develop essential skills for collaborating in a ‘Big Data’ world and presenting analyses of
complex data sets to diverse audiences as well as promote a sense of belonging, a key factor in achievement
and retention of underrepresented minority students. The program directors are counseled by an internal
advisory committee composed of faculty with experience in student mentoring and directing training programs,
and a team of external advisors with experience developing T32 and other training programs. Collectively, this
hierarchy of advisors and mentors will ensure that the program produces the next generation of leaders in ‘Big

Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug-seeking which persists despite
adverse consequences [WHO 1992; American Psychiatric Association 2013]. in the past few years, misuse of
opioids (both prescribed and illegal) increased considerably. However, there are very few effective and approved
pharmacotherapies available [Pierce et al. 2012]. Recent research activities in the field of orexin biology have
demonstrated the significance of these receptors in the domain of addiction. The development of a PET imaging
tracer would permit detection and quantification of orexin receptors in vivo thereby accelerating research and
increasing our understanding of orexin functions in the domain of drug addiction.
The specific aims of this project, will focus on the synthesis, evaluation and characterization of potential OX1R
antagonists (Aim 1). Perform In vivo quantification of the binding potential (BP) of the candidate OX1R radiotracer
in baboons (Aim 2).
If successful, this project will provide “proof of concept” imaging data and a lead PET imaging tracer that can be
further examined in human as part of a future R01 application."
10761723,"Project Summary/Abstract
Doxorubicin is a highly effective chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat multiple cancers, but its use is
limited due to cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity can range from asymptomatic reduction in left ventricular ejection
fraction to highly symptomatic heart failure (Class III to IV). Acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC)
occurs in ~11% of patients, and long-term cardiotoxic side effects can develop in ~36% of patients up to 10
years after treatment. Despite being the most effective class of anti-cancer drug and widely used since last five
decades, the molecular mechanisms that underly DIC remain poorly understood. To date, three major inter-
related mechanisms for cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin have been proposed: (i) generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent membrane damage, (ii) inhibition of topoisomerase II-β (TOP2B)
topoisomerase I mitochondrial (TOP1MT), and (iii) modulation of intracellular calcium release. However, as
cardiotoxicity in DIC patients may not emerge for years or decades, a better understanding of the different
mechanisms in DIC across different cardiac cell types and their crosstalk can have significant implications on
the search for therapeutics.
The endothelium is a critical component of the cardiovascular system that forms a protective barrier for CMs
and releases paracrine factors to maintain CM health and function. It has been shown that DOX disrupts the
normal endothelial physiology by damaging ECs that can lead to the development of severe chronic vascular
diseases such as atherosclerosis, which often leads to cardiac dysfunction. With the knowledge that
dysfunctional ECs can have a negative impact on CM function, we need a better understanding of the integral
role of ECs in the development of doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury. Despite impressive progress, little
attention has been given to the potential importance of cell-to-cell signaling between ECs and CMs, despite the
fact that ECs serve a paracrine function to enhance signaling in CMs, especially in context to pharmacological
stimulation. This knowledge gap impedes our comprehensive understanding of organ dysfunction at a multi-
cellular level. The overarching goal of our proposal is to use a multidisciplinary approach that integrates human
iPSCs, bioengineering tools, and NGS to gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of DIC. We will pursue three
specific aims. In Aim 1: we will establish an experimental platform to study the role of ECs in DIC. For this, we
will recapitulate the EC-CM crosstalk in DIC patient’s iPSC-derived cells with 3D engineered heart tissues
(EHTs). In Aim 2: we will decipher the mechanism of EC-CM crosstalk in EHTs treated with DOX using single-
cell approaches (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). In Aim 3: we will validate the key regulatory players of EC-CM
crosstalk in an animal model of DIC. Our proposal is supported by compelling preliminary data from a multi-
disciplinary team of investigators. We believe we are well positioned to achieve the project goals within five
years."

 Theranostics combines molecular targeted diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides for imaging and ther-
apy in advanced malignancies, with a projected US market of more than $6.7B. Currently, metastatic castra-
tion-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with FDA approved lutetium-177 (177Lu)-based peptide receptor
targeting radionuclide therapy (PRRT), represents the largest market. Prostate specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) is the most commonly used molecular target for combined imaging and treatment of mCRPC. Recent
studies have demonstrated that PSMA PET/CT has high potential to assess tumor PSMA status, treatment
response assessment, and treatment-related toxicities in mCRPC. However, due to the lack of commercial
image analysis software tools, the full potential of theranostic patient imaging is underutilized clinically.
Currently, treating clinicians cannot fully utilize the information provided by molecular images, because
manual image assessment is both laborious and subjective. Currently, there are no tools to combine and
automate (1) cross-modality radiotracer uptake concordance (e.g.PSMA PET/CT vs. CT), (2) assessment of
individual lesion response for all lesions, and (3) early identification of critical organ toxicity, nor can any
compute all three simultaneously, quantitatively, and efficiently. Therefore, it is crucial to have a dedicated
and optimized theranostics tool that provides quantitative information for all three assessments to help
understand the interplay between lesion response, treatment-related toxicities, organ and lesion radiation
dose estimates, target receptor expression, and the impact of each of these factors on predicting patient
outcomes. To meet these challenges, AIQ Solutions proposes to develop a dedicated, AI-powered
theranostics product called TRAQinform Theranostics for theranostic patient management that provides a
comprehensive spatio- temporal analysis of theranostic response including: (1) quantification of target
receptor status on a lesion-by- lesion basis to optimize theranostic patient selection, (2) quantification and
prediction of treatment efficacy, including response of all tumor lesions, and (3) quantification and prediction
of treatment-related toxicities in critical organs.
 Successful development of TRAQinform Theranostics will provide treating clinicians and researchers
with actionable, quantitative, and clinically relevant decision-making data much earlier in the treatment
process, thus improving clinical outcomes, improving quality of life and reducing therapy costs. This novel
software will be integrated into AIQ’s patented, FDA 510(k)-cleared suite of treatment response assessment
software."

10929478,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL
The Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s overarching goals
are to further increase SDSU’s cancer research capacities and expand SDSU’s and UCSD’s emphasis on
cancer health disparities research. Bi-directional community engagement is also a principal feature that is
integrated across every organizational component in the CREATE Partnership and is a strength that SDSU
has built over the last 30 years. Additional goals include developing cancer research opportunities and
pathways for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, as well as early-stage investigators (ESIs),
which will lead to a future workforce that is more diverse and reflective of the catchment-area population. To
meet these overarching goals, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Recruit and support diverse ESIs
who have chosen an intentional career goal to become independent, cancer-focused researchers
(Administrative Core and Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT for Equity [TALENT] Shared Resource); 2)
Conduct catchment-area relevant research and pilot research projects aligned with identified cancer priorities
for the underserved communities in the region (Research and Research Pilot Projects and Planning and
Evaluation Core); 3) Expand and implement cancer, cancer disparities, and community-engaged research
education with a focus on under-represented students across SDSU and UCSD undergraduate, graduate
programs, and medical students (Research Education Core); and 4) Integrate community engagement into all
CREATE Partnership activities (Outreach Core). To achieve these aims, the CREATE Partnership requests the
initial support for two Full Research Projects and one Pilot Research Project designed to provide insight into
the mechanisms (or behaviors) underlying cancer health disparities. All three projects will be jointly led by
SDSU and UCSD Co-Leads; Project 2 is co-led by two under-represented researchers. The Research Projects
will be integrated with the Research Education Core, providing expanded research experiences in cancer,
cancer disparities, and community-engaged research to under-represented undergraduate, graduate, and
medical students. A TALENT Shared Resource will foster the career development of Partnership ESIs. The
Outreach Core will develop new and strengthen existing community-academic partnerships to foster cancer
research, education, and tailored outreach efforts with a focus on the dissemination and implementation of

10916445,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Enzymes, supported by their macromolecular structure, can catalyze chemical transformations with exquisite
control, delivering products with high selectivity. The mechanisms that enzymes can support, however, are
limited, making chemical technologies often the preferred method for synthesis, regardless of cost, toxicity, and
environmental burden. Herein are two proposals to expand the activity of enzymes beyond their natural function
for synthesizing medicinally important functional groups. Specifically, heme enzymes and methionine sulfoxide
reductases are tasked for the first time with performing aminations and oxidations, respectively, toward
synthesizing chiral trifluoroethylamines, sulfoxides, and sulfoximines, motifs known to bestow function and drug-
like properties to therapeutics and clinical candidates. By engineering enzymes to catalyze reactions beyond
their natural capabilities, we are boldly pushing the boundaries of biology and chemistry. This innovation has the
potential to revolutionize the way we make molecules and introduce new chemical reactions that can be
performed in living organisms. Furthermore, these efforts will unlock activities never before seen in biocatalysis,
expanding the repertoire of genetically encoded chemical transformations. The success of this proposal will
afford high-value molecules and biorenewable catalysts that may lead to the discovery of new medicines and
strategies to regulate biology, with the ultimate objective of informing and improving human health."
10765733,"The Clinical Problem: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of preterm infants is
associated with significant respiratory complications that continue into adulthood. BPD results from a disruption
in pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth. Recent studies suggest vitamin D plays a role in fetal lung
development and enhances lung development in an animal model of chorioamnionitis. However, the
mechanisms through which vitamin D enhances vascular and alveolar growth remain unknown.
The Candidate: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics, and board certified Neonatologist
at the University Colorado School of Medicine. My studies on the effects of vitamin D on lung growth and
function were the first to demonstrate a striking protective effect of early vitamin D treatment in an animal
model of BPD, and further show that at least part of these effects are mediated through enhanced or preserved
pro-angiogenic signaling mechanisms after lung injury. My short-term goals: 1) advance my understanding
and use of mouse genetics to study mechanistic regulation of vitamin D and lung development; 2) develop new
skills to analyze and interpret genomic and genetic data to determine vitamin D-sensitive pathways during fetal
lung development; 3) expand my understanding and skills in statistics and bioinformatics. My long-term
career goal is to become an independent physician scientist who will effectively translate mechanistic
basic studies in pulmonary vascular development into new insights regarding the pathogenesis and
potential treatment of BPD. During the fourth year of this award period, I will submit my first R01 application.
The Research: Based on current literature and our preliminary data, the central hypothesis to this proposal is
that abnormal vitamin D signaling in experimental BPD contributes to abnormal vascular and alveolar
growth, causes PH, and increases susceptibility to the adverse effects of perinatal injury on lung
structure and that the pro-angiogenic effects of vitamin D in the developing lung are mediated through
increased PPARγ and VEGF signaling. We propose the following specific aims: Aim #1: To determine
whether fetal vitamin D deficiency impairs endothelial cell growth, function, and angiocrine signaling pathways,
which causes abnormal vascular and airspace structure, and increases susceptibility to postnatal hyperoxia;
Aim #2: To determine whether perinatal vitamin D signaling enhances lung structure by preserving PPARγ –
VEGF signaling in the fetal rat lung after endotoxin exposure and prevents BPD and PH; Aim #3: To determine
whether impaired vitamin D signaling due to EC-specific vitamin D receptor deficiency disrupts lung growth,
causes PH and increases the severity of lung injury to antenatal (ETX) or postnatal (hyperoxia) stress.
The Environment: I have strong multidisciplinary mentorship by established investigators (University of
Colorado School of Medicine and Purdue University). My mentoring team has extensive experience in basic
vascular pulmonary and vitamin D biology research and a strong track record of prior successful mentorship."
10763997,"Abstract: A defining feature of cells are membrane bilayers that separate them from their environment and, in
eukaryotic cells, delineate intracellular organelles with specialized functions. For cells to live and replicate, they
must be able to maintain and expand these membranes. In eukaryotes, the lipid building blocks of membranes
are made mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to other organelles from there. While
the role of vesicle trafficking for lipid transfer between organelles has long been known, we have only in the last
decade begun to appreciate the importance of non-vesicular protein-mediated lipid transfer at so-called
membrane contact sites, where two organelles are closely apposed. Indeed, the ER, the main site of lipid
synthesis, contacts every other cellular organelle at such sites. The main focus of the laboratory is to identify
and characterize the protein residents of contact sites in order to better elucidate the still largely unknown lipid
transfer processes that occur there, their molecular basis, and their role in physiology. Contact site residents
include lipid “shuttles”, proteins that equilibrate lipids between organelles, typically one lipid at a time, in order to
fine-tune the lipid compositions of apposed contact site membranes. In addition, just in this last grant period, the
PIs group was central to the discovery of elongated lipid transfer proteins in the VPS13 family that span between
organelles and serve as bridges, with long hydrophobic grooves that solubilize lipid fatty acid moieties, allowing
for bulk lipid flow across the aqueous space between membranes. Paradigm-shifting studies from the PI’s group
and collaborator suggest that these lipid transfer bridges work in partnership with integral membrane proteins,
such as scramblases, to function in membrane expansion and organelle biogenesis, for example in the de novo
formation of the autophagosome or the yeast prospore membrane. The role of protein-mediated lipid transfer in
organelle biogenesis was unanticipated and previously thought to involve exclusively the fusion of hundreds of
vesicles, as vesicles were until recently the only known mechanism for bulk lipid movement. The PI will continue
the systematic characterization of contact site proteins and their physiological roles; emphasis going forward will
be to dissect the mechanisms by which bridge-like lipid transporters collaborate with integral membrane proteins,
including scramblases, to transfer lipids directionally from their site of synthesis to other organelles for membrane
maintenance or de novo organelle formation."

Funded by NIH in 2008, 2013 and 2018, the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI) at
the University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver) has transformed the clinical and translational research and
training enterprise in the Colorado region with the vision of accelerating the translation of discoveries into
improved, equitable patient care and public health for all. The CCTSI, headquartered at the CU Anschutz Medical
Campus, is a partnership of CU Denver, CU Boulder, Colorado State University (CSU), 5 hospital systems and
20 community organizations, which has advanced translational science by educating a diverse workforce,
creating a collaborative environment that supports local and multi-site research, engaging communities through
its unique community engagement program, creating methodologies that support research in special
populations, and greatly enhancing our informatics and data science capabilities. The CCTSI infrastructure
played a critical role in the Colorado response to the COVID pandemic and led to new innovations in research
processes and implementation, while recognizing the health inequities and disparities exposed by the pandemic
in rural, minority and underserved populations in Colorado. Despite the successes, there remain many
challenges to overcoming inefficiencies and roadblocks in clinical translational science (CTS) processes
locally and nationally and in reducing health disparities and inequities. This application maps our
collaborative path forward to meet these challenges. In the next grant cycle, we will enhance our efforts to
improve efficiency and coordination with Partners and across the CTSA Consortium, reinforce our extensive
community partnerships, develop innovative informatics and technology solutions to advance CTS, and develop
a diverse highly-skilled translational workforce for the future. This UM1 will be tightly coordinated with our other
6 CTSA grant applications, to accomplish the following 6 Overall Strategic Goals: Goal 1: Advance CTS by
developing, demonstrating, and disseminating innovative programs to improve the efficiency and impact of
translation across the entire T0.5 to T4 spectrum. Goal 2: Promote collaboration, team and data science, and
partnerships to accelerate CTS locally, regionally and nationally. Goal 3: Partner locally, regionally and nationally
with institutions, stakeholders and communities to develop innovative research programs that will address health
inequities and disparities. Goal 4: Further develop operational efficiencies to enhance the quality, safety,
efficiency, effectiveness and informativeness of clinical research. Goal 5: Promote a nimble research
environment that can rapidly respond to urgent public health needs. Goal 6: Develop and disseminate CTS
training programs that educate and sustain a resilient, diverse team of clinical research professionals and
investigators. Special efforts will be made to enhance diversity in our workforce. Progress will be monitored and
improved by our Evaluation Core and CQI program and we will make mid-course corrections as needed to
achieve these goals and ultimately improve the health of our state and the nation."
10765663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The research we propose in this application seeks to translate our recent understanding of the
neuroprotective mechanism associated with the human apolipoprotein E2 (ApoE2) genotype into a
therapeutic opportunity to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). The overarching hypotheses
are that introduction of human ApoE2 protein into high-risk ApoE4 and AD brains positively alters the
course of brain aging or disease pathogenesis by bolstering brain resilience through enhanced
glycolytic metabolism, which subsequently improves glucose utilization, protein homeostasis, and
synaptic activity. In preparation, we have achieved three major milestones critical to the success
of this translational endeavor: (1) development of a method for the production of physiologically
relevant and human-compatible recombinant ApoE2 (rhApoE2) glycoprotein that possesses biological
functionality comparable to endogenous human ApoE2; (2) development of a noninvasive approach
for brain delivery of rhApoE2 glycoprotein via modulation of cadherin interactions on the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), which induces neuroprotective signaling in ApoE4 brains; and (3) development of novel
humanized knock-in mouse models that respectively target human sporadic (sAD) and familial AD
(fAD), which are expected to provide high predictive validity for translating bench successes to
bedside. The proposed studies will pursue three specific aims. Building on our initial success, the
objective of the first aim is to determine the therapeutically optimal regimen for delivery of rhApoE2
glycoprotein that will result in deposition of rhApoE2 throughout cortical and hippocampal regions and
upregulation of brain glycolytic metabolism without eliciting adverse reactions. The objective of the
second aim is to evaluate the therapeutic impact of rhApoE2 delivery, in combination with age and
sex, on brain changes associated with sAD in humanized mouse models that express physiological
levels of human ApoE3 or ApoE4 and human wild-type APP proteins. The third aim will be
investigated in humanized mouse models that express physiological levels of human ApoE3 or ApoE4
and human mutant APP proteins to evaluate the therapeutic impact of rhApoE2 delivery on brain
changes associated with fAD, and how the rhApoE2-mediated effects are modified by a combination
of age, sex, ApoE genotype, and disease status. Our overall goals for the proposed research are
to establish the plausibility of targeting brain metabolic resilience as a disease-modifying strategy and
generate proof of concept as to whether a rhApoE2-based protein therapy can potentially be
developed into an effective and safe intervention for AD."
10764010,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought into stark relief the many healthcare challenges facing individuals living in
rural areas—the compounded needs of an aging population, geographic dispersion, inadequate public
transportation, spotty internet service, spikes in substance use, vaccine hesitancy. These disparities—like most
public health problems—reflect a complex interplay of biological, environmental, psychological, social, and
systems-level factors. At the same time, the pandemic highlighted potential solutions and spurred a wealth of
research in healthcare delivery science in rural areas. Much of this work was conducted by scientists affiliated
with SYNERGY, Dartmouth’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute, founded in 2013. SYNERGY faculty
reported the expanded use of telehealth, digital health, machine learning; strengthened partnerships between
healthcare systems and community health centers; and developed a “COVID compass” to guide policymaking.
Our work in this area, centered in SYNERGY’s earliest years, has deepened our commitment to translational
science that centers rural healthcare delivery and health equity, while exploring the full spectrum of
translational science and workforce development. Hence, we propose to return SYNERGY to the national
CTSA consortium. The overarching goal of this application is to continue to spur innovation in clinical and
translational science with a focus on rural healthcare, in collaboration with other CTSA hubs, and to study a
new model to catalyze T3 translational science in healthcare settings. SYNERGY reflects a close partnership
between Dartmouth Health (DH) and Dartmouth College (DC). DH is the largest healthcare system in New
Hampshire, with its flagship hospital in a rurally designated area. DC brings the resources of a research-
intensive college, including schools of medicine, engineering, business, and graduate studies. SYNERGY
includes our new Center for Rural Healthcare Delivery Science and key regional collaborators, including the
Northern New England Clinical Translational Research Network (a partnership between MaineHealth and the
University of Vermont), a Veterans Affairs hospital, community groups, and a “pipeline” program to grow the
scientific workforce. SYNERGY’s goals are to (1) Accelerate the delivery of evidence-based diagnostics,
therapeutics, and processes to address the healthcare needs of rural communities; (2) Assure the availability
of timely, actionable patient- and population-level data to mitigate the translational block of “siloing” between
translational scientists and healthcare system leadership by deploying a novel coproduction learning health
system (LHS); (3) Train the next generation of translational scientists, with a particular focus on identifying
future leaders in healthcare delivery science and rural health; (4) Disseminate these practices and lessons
learned within the CTSA community through engagement with subnetworks addressing rural health,
implementation science, and learning health systems science; and (5) Involve local communities in the design,
conduct, analysis, and dissemination of our work, while engaging in studies of stakeholder engagement."

 Transmembrane receptors are the major mediators of signaling for cells to communicate with the
environment, playing essential roles in many cellular processes, including migration, proliferation and
immunity. Malfunction of these receptors are associated with diseases such as cancer and neurological
disorders. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the general mechanisms by which
signal is transduced from one to the other side of the membrane through the transmembrane region of
receptors, in particular single-pass transmembrane receptors. On the other hand, each receptor has its own
unique properties and mechanisms. We also study the individual characteristic features of these receptors,
especially larger assemblies beyond the ligand-induced dimeric receptor paradigm. A better understanding of
the transmembrane signaling mechanisms of these receptors will lay the foundation for the development of
targeted therapies for associated diseases. We use structural approaches, including both cryo-EM and X-ray
crystallography, in combination with in vitro biophysical and biochemical analyses and cell-based functional
assays. In the past, we had focused mostly on plexin, the largest family of guidance receptors critical for the
development of the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Plexin activated by the semaphorin ligand
transduces repulsive signal to steer the growth cone of the neuron for the formation of the neuronal network.
Plexin is also critical for regulating immunity and wound healing. In the next few years, one major goal of the
work on plexin is to understand how the transmembrane regions of plexin and its co-receptor neuropilin couple
the extracellular ligand-binding region and the intracellular effector region for precise controlling of signaling
across the plasma membrane. In particular, we will analyze novel regulatory mechanisms endowed by large
assemblies of semaphorin, plexin and neuropilin. In addition, we will expand our work to other receptors
involved in the neuronal, cardiovascular and immune systems. For example, neuropilin also serves as a co-
receptor for VEGF receptor (VEGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis. Neuropilin can dramatically increases the potency of VEGF in activating VEGFR. We will
analyze the mechanism of the signaling enhancing effect of neuropilin on VEGFR. The functions of
semaphorin also extent beyond plexin. Red blood cell-derived Sema7A binds GPIb, a protein complex
specifically expressed on platelets, and thereby stimulates thrombo-inflammation in myocardial ischemia-
reperfusion injury. GPIb contains transmembrane receptors GPIbα, GPIbβ and GPIX in a 1:2:1 stoichiometry.
The best-known function of GPIb is triggering platelet activation in response to VWF (von WilleBrand Factor),
vital to hemostasis. We will analyze how Sema7A and VWF bind GPIb and how the binding induces the
activation of GPIb."
10765609,"Breathing is the most fundamental motor behavior for terrestrial vertebrates. The frequency and amplitude of
breathing movements are controlled by neural networks residing in the brainstem and spinal cord. In mammals,
contraction of the diaphragm muscle is essential for driving airflow into the lungs during inspiration. Despite the
complexity of the neural networks that regulate respiratory rhythms, diaphragm contraction is controlled by a
single motor input, the activity of motor neurons (MNs) within the Phrenic Motor Column (PMC) in the cervical
spinal cord. Loss of PMC neurons is the primary cause of death in degenerative MN diseases such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal cord injuries. Despite their essential role, the molecular
determinants of PMC neuron identity are largely unknown. We have found that the development of PMC neurons
requires the sustained activity of Hox5 transcription factors. Mice lacking Hox5 genes in MNs die of respiratory
failure at birth and exhibit defects in multiple aspects of PMC identity, including cell body position, axon guidance
and diaphragm innervation. In this proposal we will investigate the function of Hox5 genes in determining and
maintaining phrenic MN identity.
In Aim 1 we will determine temporally distinct functions of Hox5 proteins in phrenic MNs and how phrenic MN
identity is maintained throughout lifetime.
In Aim 2 we will define how Hox5 genes control phrenic MN specification at the transcriptional level.
In Aim 3 we will identify direct Hox5 effectors and dissect their regulatory mechanisms.
We have developed an integrative methodology encompassing genetic models, high-throughput sequencing,
electrophysiology and behavioral assays, such as plethysmography, to address these questions in vivo. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to uncover the basic principles underlying phrenic MN specification and
maintenance so that we can begin to consider alternative treatment methods for respiratory dysfunction."

The overall objective of the proposed Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Training and Research Program (TAMTRP)
is to enhance the cancer research capacity of the major cancer research institution in Tanzania, the Ocean
Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) in partnership with the Stanley S. Scott Cancer Center (SSSCC) at the Louisiana
State University Health Science Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO). The proposed program will build onto
our existing collaboration, prepare ORCI personnel to fill gaps in expertise while preparing for the future of HIV
associated cancer diagnostics and research in cancer genomics and therapy. The scientific focus of TAMTRP
is research and training in molecular detection/diagnosis, and in quantifying the epidemiology and biology of
the most common HIV associated malignancies in Tanzania, especially those with infectious etiology. The
short-term goals are: 1) to enhance the ORCI cancer research and training infrastructure. 2) Institute a
training and mentoring program for Tanzanians to conduct research on cancers that are commonly
encountered at ORCI and SSSCC. These goals will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) Provide
intensive academic instruction and research experience for two PhD and four Master's degree candidates in a
relevant HIV associated cancer research field. 2) Provide medium-term (three to six months) technical training
opportunities for post-graduates and health care providers in topics related to molecular pathology, cancer
biology, bioinformatics, genomics, biostatistics, bio banking, cancer registry, as well as clinical and translational
research. 3) Deliver technical workshops designed to enhance basic, clinical, implementation, genomics,
bioinformatics, computation genomics, epidemiology, biostatistics, and continue to expand collaborations
between partner institutions to enhance the research capability and infrastructure in Tanzania. There are four
training tracks: a) clinical trials methodologies and management; b) public health operational and translational
research– including cancer prevention, biostatistics and data management, epidemiology, cancer registry, and
bio banking; c) laboratory-based cancer biology research– including molecular biology/virology, pathology,
diagnostics, viral oncology, and immunology; d) cancer genomics and bioinformatics–including next generation
sequencing, data management, big data analytics, and computational genomics. TAMTRP will be critical in the
preparation of ORCI (and Tanzania) for the era of personalized and precision cancer medicine, which will
utilize cancer genomics for cancer detection, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. It will provide important
insight in the understanding and prevention of HIV associated and non-HIV associated malignancies in
Tanzania, and reciprocally, in the U.S."

Project Summary
Trauma is the leading cause of preventable death, with the majority of deaths caused by hemorrhage and
associated complications due to injury to the vasculature (hemorrhagic shock [HS]). While hemorrhage results
in the rapid loss of coagulation factors and platelets, increasing evidence suggests that secondary coagulopathy
develops from a trauma-induced hypercoagulable state that rapidly turns into consumptive coagulopathy, and
is an integral part of microvascular endotheliopathy due to HS-induced hypoperfuson and tissue ischemia. The
endotheliopathy creates an inflammatory and oxidative stress environment where endothelial cells (ECs) are
activated and their barrier function disrupted. A hallmark of this microvascular dysregulation is loss of the
endothelial glycocalyx, a protective layer of carbohydrates anchored to the endothelium by syndecan-1. The
glycocalyx shields endothelial cells from blood and plasma factors and hosts anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic,
and anti-oxidative stress molecules. It is lost following HS with shedding of the syndecan-1 ectodomain by the
metalloprotease ADAM-17. Loss the of glycocalyx makes the anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory endothelium
highly procoagulant and proinflammatory. The critical question is what triggers shedding and its pathological
consequences. Our recent data suggests causal roles of the adhesive ligand von Willebrand factor (VWF) and
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in endotheliopathy and coagulopathy secondary to trauma and resultant HS. In this
study, we propose to test the hypotheses that: 1) syndecan-1 shedding with progressive endothelial
dysregulation caused by release of hyperadhesive VWF and pathologic EVs, 2) syndecan-1 shedding is triggered
by clustering with ADAM-17 in membrane lipid rafts, and 3) exposure of the receptor-binding A1 domain on
hyperadhesive VWF enhances endotheliopathy by tethering inflammatory cells and EVs to the glycocalyx-
stripped endothelium. We further hypothesize that the synergistic interplay between glycocalyx loss,
hyperadhesive VWF, and EVs can be blocked to prevent endotheliopathy. We propose to test these hypotheses
by analyzing plasma samples and clinical information from trauma patients, defining pathways leading to
syndecan-1 shedding and the structural basis of VWF hyperadhesive activity in-vitro, and testing new and
innovative therapeutic strategies in mouse models of HS in the following three aims: Aim 1: To determine the
progressive microvascular dysregulation culminating in blood failure of injured patients with hemorrhagic
shock; Aim 2: To study the pathway of syndecan-1 shedding and the structure of hyperadhesive VWF in-vitro,
and Aim 3: To test new therapeutic agents to mitigate trauma-induced microvascular dysregulation in mouse
models of HS. Our proposal puts forth innovative concepts and novel mechanisms that offer a new paradigm
for the reversal of endotheliopathy and coagulopathy that can establish the foundation for the development of
innovative therapeutics as resuscitation adjuncts to further reduce hemorrhagic shock-related morbidity and
mortality.

Protein phosphorylation is the most important and most extensively studied mechanism by which cells rapidly
sense signals, transduce signals, and execute decisions. Protein phosphorylation provides a means to
dynamically regulate protein function, is integral to all cellular processes, and abnormal phosphorylation is
associated with many diseases. In our previous research, we developed and applied experimental and
computational phosphoproteomics methods to systematically interrogate the signaling network and reveal its
architecture and design principles. Our rigorous research delivered reproducible methods, which are essential
to analyze phosphoproteomes in multi-perturbation studies. Our applications delivered knowledge that is
crucially important to understand why different cell types respond differently to the same stimuli to accomplish
different functions.
Building on the methods we developed and knowledge acquired, we propose to focus our research for the next
5 years on the functional aspects of protein phosphorylation, addressing the outstanding question of how
phosphorylation regulates the organization of the cellular proteome. We will expand our studies in multiple
directions that represent the next frontier in signaling biology. First, we will identify phosphosites that are
relevant to protein functions at the proteomic scale. Second, we will study how phosphorylation regulates the
multi-level organization of the cellular proteome from transient protein interactions to subcellular organelles.
Third, we will study the differences in signaling of morphologically distinct cellular phenotypes. Fourth, we will
develop methods to include phosphorylation of tyrosine and histidine in phosphoproteomic studies. Fifth, we
will assess the impact of mutations on protein functions at the proteomic scale.
To achieve these goals, we will combine mass spectrometry-based proteomics, high throughput biochemistry,
molecular biology, advanced microscopy, cell sorting, and computational and statistical methods, placing a
strong emphasis on expanding the capabilities of current proteomic methods. This research will deliver new
methods and a wealth of knowledge of protein phosphorylation in a spatial, temporal, and functional context;
which can be expanded in many new directions. Our discoveries on the basic functioning and regulation of
proteins can have an immediate translational impact by informing us about the functional consequences of
mutations and changes in phosphorylation in disease states."

Designated as a Hub in 2018, NJ ACTS soon faced a devastating pandemic that served as a springboard to re-
imagine how we provided our services and facilitated research despite multiple logistic, staffing, recruitment, and
safety challenges. From these experiences, NJ ACTS can now reimage its programs and services to catalyze
breakthroughs in practices and policies that impact health. In the next 7 years, NJ ACTS will address and
overcome challenges and barriers that impede the progress of translation and the adoption of evidence-based
processes that will impact the health of NJ. Our approach to providing these solutions will be accelerated by our
strengths in dissemination and implementation (D&I) science, informatics, clinical trial performance, and our
ability to provide translational science services across the ecosystem. NJ ACTS seeks to advance CTS by
developing, demonstrating, and disseminating best-in-class processes, services, and training that incorporate
and advance team science, diversity and inclusion, D&I science, health policy, and the learning health system.
We will incorporate our diverse communities into our work, understanding their priorities and concerns. In this
way and especially through more representative participant populations, we will advance our understanding of
the heterogeneity of the disease and response to therapy and address health disparities. In Aim 1, NJ ACTS will
provide a sustainable infrastructure that will provide access to unique study cohorts, tools, and opportunities.
Aim 2 will use our strengths in community engagement to develop innovative interdisciplinary approaches to
improve population health. Aim 3 will enhance our workforce through targeted training, recognizing their
achievements through digital badging and certificates. In Aim 4, we will integrate large and disparate databases
with the EHR to provide reliable, comprehensive, and shareable data for interventional or observational clinical
trial research that in turn provides a roadmap to enhance healthcare delivery in diverse individuals, communities,
and populations. In partnership with the Consortium, we will propel CTS discovery, dissemination, and
implementation. Success will be defined using rigorous evaluation science approaches that will provide
directions for continuous improvement."
10764432,"Project Summary
Inflammation is a complex process with many lipid and peptide mediators involved. A large number of these
mediators elicit either pro-inflammatory or pro-resolving effects through the action on G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs). My lab is interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory and pro-
resolving GPCRs sense diverse signaling molecules and transduce chemical signals across the cell membrane
to regulate inflammation. We employ a combination of research approaches in structural biology including cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM), pharmacology, and computational biology. We are also making efforts to develop
novel ligands of those GPCRs as potential new drugs through structure-based approaches. In the last funding
period, we have determined structures of several members of a chemotactic GPCR family including the C5a
receptor (C5aR), the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2), and the formylpeptide receptors bound to diverse
agonists or antagonists at different conformational states, which allowed us to define the molecular basis for the
action of several drugs and drug candidates. In the current proposal, we will study the signaling and
pharmacology of three lipid GPCRs that regulate different aspects of inflammation, the chemerin receptor
CMKLR1 (ChemR23), GPR32, and GPR84. Both CMKLR1 and GPR32 are closely related to the C5aR, DP2
and FPRs. They have been shown to respond to resolvins, which are SPMs derived from ω-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs), to induce the resolution of inflammation. In contrast, GPR84 is a newly characterized pro-
inflammatory GPCR that can be activated by endogenous medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) to augment
inflammatory responses and enhance phagocytosis by macrophages. For the next five years, we aim to provide
a comprehensive molecular understanding of how diverse lipid, peptide, and synthetic small-molecule ligands
act on and regulate the activities of these three lipid GPCRs. Our studies will exploit unique properties of
CMKLR1, GPR32, and GPR84 to address several fundamental issues of GPCR signaling and pharmacology
including lipid recognition, receptor antagonism, allosteric modulation, and biased signaling. Our research
strategies developed in this proposal will be applied to our future research on the structure and pharmacology of
other fatty acid receptors (FFARs) in immunometabolism. We will also identify new hit compounds for these
GPCRs in the next five years, which will be further developed in future as useful pharmacological tools and
potential drugs to control inflammation."
10764434,"We are a computational lab and our research is within the areas of Computational Biophysics,
Bioinformatics, and modeling molecular effects associated with disease-causing mutations. We
develop methods, software, and webservers to enable modeling of various processes in Molecular Biology.
In the past, our primary interest was in Structural Biology, and thus the focus was on using structural
information to investigate proteins, RNAs, DNAs and their assemblages with regard with their stability,
interactions, dynamics, conformational and protonation changes, and effects of amino acid mutations (our lab
won CAGI-6 MAPK-3 challenge in 2022, to predict folding free energy changes caused by mutations). We
carry such investigations in collaborations with experimental labs. Recently we became very interested in
human genetic disorders caused by missense mutations and the molecular mechanisms which cause
pathogenicity. Our efforts were recognized by the community, and we were given the privilege to establish
and chair the first Gordon Research Conference (2014) on “Human SNPs and disease”, which is now
permanent event in GRC schedule.
With this proposal we are seeking support to continue maintain and develop DelPhi (popular method for
modeling electrostatics which currently has 8,000+ registered users), along with other methods and software
for predicting the effect of missense mutations on folding and binding free energy changes of the
corresponding macromolecules and their assemblages. Regarding DelPhi, we will focus on further
development of Gaussian-based approach of treating biological macromolecules as inhomogeneous objects,
which was shown to result in ensemble averaged folding and binding free energies. Regarding methods for
modeling effects of missense mutations on folding and binding free energies, maintenance and further
development will be done by combined first-principle and machine learning (ML) approaches. First-principle
approaches have the advantage to be applicable to any case, but are not as accurate as the ML. The ML
approaches are more accurate than the first-principle methods, however, they fail on cases not seen in the
training database. We anticipate that combining them into a consensus algorithm for predicting the change of
folding and binding free energy change will have the advantage to amplify their strengths while reducing their
deficiencies. First-principle methods further development will include the Gaussian-based entropy estimation
and novel method for calculation of electrostatic energy of inhomogeneous macromolecules; while for ML
methods it will include new features as the Gaussian-based density and entropy estimation. We will use the
above-mentioned developments along with third party methods to predict the dominant molecular effect of
missense mutations associated with diseases, in collaboration with experimental labs."

Seasonal influenza infection is a major health issue in the United States with children facing increased
susceptibility to illness and death. Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) is recommended for the
prevention of influenza in children. However, influenza vaccine protection is currently insufficient with vaccine
effectiveness from 2019-2020 estimated to be 39%. The primary driver of protection provided by influenza
vaccines are serum antibodies (Abs). T Follicular helper cells (TFH) are a subset of CD4+ T cells that interact with
activated B cells in germinal centers (GCs) to promote selection of higher affinity B cell clones, generated by
somatic hypermutation. Such clones give rise to memory B cells as well as precursors of long-lived plasma cells
(LLPCs), the latter account for durable Ab titers. Our preliminary results in a mouse model suggest that that
LLPC precursors, with a distinctive genomic profile, are preferentially generated at late phases of a sustained
GC response. We hypothesize that sustained TFH dependent GC B cell responses are required for generation of
human LLPC precursors and therefore durable Ab responses after vaccination. We propose to utilize PBMC and
serum samples, from a unique cohort of children and young adults that were administered cell-based IIV4, for
high dimensional and multi-omic analyses, so as to predict and infer latent factors and gene networks that may
underlie the generation of long-lived PCs and therefore durable Ab responses. We will use samples from selected
vaccinees in the clinical trial who mounted significant responses by d28 which were either durable (d365 titers
of Abs dropped less than 2-fold when compared with d28 titers) or waned substantially (returned to near
baseline). We will perform multi-parameter FACS based immune profiling of PBMCs with an emphasis on
activated cTFH and HA-specific B cells, cytokine profiling using MSD multiplex platform and single cell genomic
profiling using 10X multiome (scRNA-seq+scATAC-seq) of cTFH, and PC precursors at d28. These datasets will
be analyzed using state of the art and novel machine learning and computational genomics algorithms, to
delineate latent factors and gene networks, that are predictive of and may control, respectively, the generation
of LLPC precursors. Additionally, the genomic datasets are anticipated to provide the first single cell genomic
snapshots of human LLPC precursors."

Cell death is a fundamental process in animal development and homeostasis. Misregulation of
cell death is associated with a large number of human diseases. Our research program aims to
understand the diverse mechanisms of cell death, how dead cells are efficiently removed, and
the physiological effects on organisms when these processes go awry. We study these
questions in Drosophila, a model organism with exceptional genetic, genomic and cell biological
tools. Our research program focuses on several major projects. The first project investigates
non-apoptotic cell death which contributes significantly to development and disease, but is
poorly understood. In the Drosophila ovary, germline-derived nurse cells undergo non-apoptotic
programmed cell death as part of normal development. We have found that nurse cell death is
controlled largely non-autonomously by the surrounding somatic follicle cells by phagocytic and
lysosomal proteins. Ongoing work will uncover the subcellular mechanisms controlling nurse cell
destruction. A second major project investigates how dead cells are removed, particularly in
tissues without access to circulating phagocytes such as macrophages. In many mammalian
tissues, dead cells can be cleared by epithelial cells. In a Drosophila model for engulfment by
epithelial cells, starvation induces degeneration of egg chambers, where the germline is
engulfed by the surrounding epithelial follicle cells. This engulfment process happens
synchronously and rapidly at the onset of cell death; however, the genetic requirements for
engulfment by epithelial cells are not well understood. In particular, how such non-professional
phagocytes increase their phagocytic capacity is not known. Our research program is revealing
how epithelial cells transform to a phagocytic state and how they act to promote cell death. A
third project addresses the consequences of defective phagocytosis in the brain which we have
found leads to neurodegeneration and immune activation. Future work will investigate the links
between phagocytosis, immune signaling and neurodegeneration. We will determine the cell-
type-specific responses to defective phagocytosis and susceptibility to neurodegeneration. A
fourth project investigates cross-tissue interactions in response to cell death in the maintenance
of homeostasis. Given the high degree of conservation of cell death mechanisms between
Drosophila and mammals, we expect that pathways that we uncover in the fly will provide
insight into the diversity of cell death mechanisms and consequences of defective cell removal
in humans."

MOTIVATION: The burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its clinical consequences, which include stroke, heart
failure, and decreased quality of life, are expected to increase dramatically over the next several decades.
Despite this, few disease-modifying therapies exist, and symptomatic treatments are limited by side effects.
Leveraging fundamental discoveries in cardiac tissue biomechanics, this proposal takes a novel approach to
arrhythmia pathogenesis, uncovering biophysical mechanisms that underlie healthy atrial function and
pathological, pro-arrhythmic remodeling. Motivated by a desire to accurately model atrial physiology and
pathology, we use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived engineered heart tissue (EHT) and an
electro-mechanical bioreactor to delineate “healthy” vs “diseased” mechanical loading. AIMS: In Aim 1,
physiologically-inspired biomechanical strain is applied to atrial EHTs to improve their functional maturity at the
gene expression, contractile, and electrophysiological level. Successful completion of this aim will broadly
increase the applicability of engineered heart tissue for atrial disease modeling. In Aim 2, a substrate for atrial
arrhythmias will be induced by imposing pathological mechanical strain on atrial EHTs. These abnormal
mechanical strains are directly inspired by clinical imaging findings. Notably, abnormal mechanical loading of
tissue causes contractile dysfunction, along with upregulation of pathological remodeling genes, such as α-
SMA and calmodulin kinase. This suggests that a common, mechanosensitive pathway may be an attractive
upstream target for novel AF therapies. TRAINING: To enable these investigations, the applicant will pursue
new learning in stem cell biology, engineered heart tissue development, in vitro electrophysiology, and electron
microscopy. The training plan, overseen by two co-sponsors in complementary fields (biomedical
engineering/muscle physiology and electrophysiology), will emphasize acquisition of new scientific knowledge
and expertise; rigor, reproducibility, and generalizability of in vitro disease models; clinical correlations; and
professional development. The proposal will leverage cutting-edge technology and expertise at Yale University
and Yale School of Medicine, and fully support the applicant’s future career goal. RELEVANCE: AF affects
millions of Americans, and 10% of those over 80. The"

CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide. Endometriosis has been repeatedly identified as an independent
risk factor for CVD that affects an estimated one in ten women in the world. Endometriosis is a gynecologic
condition characterized by invasive extrauterine endometriotic lesions, chronic pain and pain sensitization, and
systemic inflammation and is associated with accelerated cardiovascular disease risk. The expression of
cyclooxygenase-2, a key enzyme in inflammation, is upregulated in endometriotic lesions as are its metabolites,
namely TxA2. TxA2 is a potent vasoconstrictor able to diffuse across the endothelium to act directly on its
receptors in the vascular smooth muscle. TxA2 can also antagonize NOS within the endothelial cells, preventing
vasodilation. A decrease in nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation defines endothelial dysfunction and is
regarded as a critical early event in the development of atherosclerosis and overt cardiovascular disease.
Women with endometriosis demonstrate marked endothelial dysfunction compared with healthy controls.
Furthermore, TxA2 receptors (TP) play a key role in sensitizing the sensory afferents in skeletal muscle in pre-
clinical models of cardiovascular disease, leading to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex. This is a strong
predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in cardiovascular disease patients. Therefore, the purpose of
this project is twofold: 1) to determine the effect of the TP on the regulation of microvascular function and in
circulating platelets in women with endometriosis and 2) to investigate sensory afferent sensitization in women
with endometriosis. We hypothesize that women with endometriosis demonstrate exaggerated vasoconstriction
to both pharmacological stimuli locally modulating vasomotor tone and to physiological sympathoexcitatory
stimuli. This project and associated training plan will serve as a vehicle for exceptional predoctoral training for
the candidate."

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) claims >300,000 lives yearly in the US and despite aggressive attempts at
phenotype-genotype correlations, ~50% of patients with primary electrical SCD do not meet diagnostic criteria
for any SCD syndrome and are labeled Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation (IVF). This “catch-all” diagnosis of
exclusion encompasses a cohort of individuals that are undefined phenotypically with arrhythmia that is
mechanistically unexplored. Moreover, without defined genotype-phenotype characterization, clinical practice
guidelines for IVF suggest homogenous treatment for a heterogenous disorder. Recognizing that genetic linkage
studies have failed for IVF, we propose a paradigm shift to address these challenging gaps in knowledge. We
propose to integrate computational modeling of comprehensive electrophysiologic and multiomic outputs to
identify the mechanistic underpinnings of an emerging IVF subphenotype related to Purkinje-triggered VF (PVC-
IVF). In collaboration with the Bordeaux group Deep Phenotype efforts, who originally described these emerging
subphenotypes of IVF, PVC-IVF patients have been recruited to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
from UW and Bordeaux. Our iPSC experimental system has distinct advantages including integration of PVC-
IVF iPS-cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) with a mixed (ventricular myocyte and Purkinje) cell population with
computational myocyte models reflecting region-specific phenotypes. Our group’s design for iPSCs experiments
combine innovation of platforms that promote electrical and functional maturity, including incorporation of iPS-
cardiac fibroblasts (iPS-CFs), and analysis by computational modeling of iPS-CMs and in silico adult human
myocytes and tissue. In our pilot data we demonstrate the effectiveness of using iPSCs to differentiate IVF with
experimental evidence and integrate this data into computational modeling approaches to gain mechanistic
insight into cellular arrhythmic perturbations. Our overarching goal is to examine the mechanistic underpinning
of PVC-IVF and identify specific complementary and synergistic therapeutic targets. In Aim 1 we will integrate
experimental functional readouts from our advanced model system designed to recapitulate native cardiac milieu
with a combination of micro and nanoscale cues with “bottom-up” computational modeling to unravel the specific
cellular perturbations that cause the observed functional PVC-IVF readout. The focus of Aim 2 is to incorporate
a broad, unbiased data-driven dataset from multiomic characterization of PVC-IVF patient-specific iPS-CMs into
a computational systems pharmacology framework to define synergistic arrhythmogenic pathways and
antiarrhythmic polytherapy, which we predict to be safer and more effective than monotherapy approaches.
Finally, computational cross-cell translators will predict responses in the adult heart. With completion of our aims,
we will define the cellular arrhythmic signature; unravel the down-stream transcriptome, protein expression
changes and post-translational modifications; and integrate experimental readouts with computational modeling
to create actionable data and find druggable targets for PVC-IVF arrhythmia prevention."

World Trade Center (WTC) Responders self-report high levels of poor sleep quality and exhibit a high
prevalence of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia. Research
investigating brain health in this population indicates early-age cognitive impairments and
neurodegeneration associated with both physical exposures of particulate neurotoxins at the WTC site
and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is evidence that poor sleep quality is
associated with cognitive impairments, biomarkers of neurodegeneration and dementia in both sleep
disorders and the general community. However, it is not known if poor sleep quality contributes to
increased risk of neurodegeneration in WTC Responders. Sleep quality is a term that encompasses
multiple aspects of sleep initiation, maintenance, quantity, and refreshment upon awakening. It is
typically assessed subjectively using questionnaires that evaluate general satisfaction with current
sleep-related quality of life, sleep behaviors or symptoms. A potentially useful, and objectively
measured, proxy for sleep quality is sleep stability. Metrics of sleep stability can be obtained through
the lens of the central nervous system (CNS) with electroencephalography (EEG) or the corresponding
autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity using cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC). EEG-measured rapid
eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep instability is characteristic of insomnia and OSA.
Sleep instability caused by OSA results in impaired sleep-dependent memory and increases in markers
of neurodegeneration. Reduced and delayed REM, manifestations of REM instability, are associated
with increased risk of dementia in a large community cohort. Quality EEG signals are difficult to obtain
at-home but newer, wearable CPC-measuring devices can provide sleep quality and disorder severity
measures from the home. CPC measured sleep demonstrates exaggerated night-to-night variability in
insomnia. Highly variable sleep schedules predict successful response to treatment with cognitive
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi). We plan to enroll 40 WTC Responders who will undergo 2
weeks at-home CPC sleep monitoring followed by an overnight in-lab PSG with pre/post-sleep
emotional memory picture task and blood sampling. Aim 1a is to test whether single-night REM sleep
instability measured by EEG activity is associated with impaired emotional memory. Exploratory Aim
1b is to test any potential association between impaired overnight memory processing and overnight
change in plasma biomarkers Tau and NFL. Aim 2 is to test whether inconsistent sleep quality
measured by night-to-night variability in CPC is associated with greater evening plasma Tau and NFL
levels."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), caused by atrophy of frontal and/or anterior temporal lobes, is
the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. FTD patients often show
changes in personality, loss of empathy and disinhibition, or language impairment and movement
deficits. The most common genetic cause of FTD is a GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in the
first intron of the C9ORF72 gene. The sense and antisense repeat RNAs are translated into 5
different dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that are observed in C9ORF72 patient brain neurons.
Among them, poly(GR) and poly(PR) are most toxic but it remains largely unknown which specific
molecular and structural mechanisms of action underly their neurotoxicity. In this R21 project, we
will examine the high-resolution structural mechanisms of poly(GR) and poly(PR) production by
the ribosome, the underlying cis-inhibition of translation by expanded G4C2 repeats and DPR
proteins, and translation dysregulation directly in FTD patient neurons. By discovering the
molecular mechanisms of C9ORF72-caused FTD and further developing tools for high-resolution
structural biology in neurons, our project may open new directions in neuroscience research and
therapeutics development of other molecular pathologies underlying dementia."
10906025,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process that is aberrantly reactivated in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to promote disease progression and chemoresistance. PDAC tumors
and cell lines typically contain a heterogeneous mixture of transformed cells displaying epithelial or mesenchymal
characteristics, complicating efforts to understand the regulatory mechanisms that govern this important
phenotypic switching. The observation that EMT can be initiated by a variety of different growth factors, low
oxygen tension, and matrix-mediated signaling strongly suggests that multiple signaling pathways cooperate to
drive robust EMT and raises the possibility that EMT heterogeneity is explained by the ability of only some cells
to activate robustly the pathways that cooperate to drive EMT. Another potential, but not necessarily mutually
exclusive, explanation for phenotypic heterogeneity is that some PDAC cells are primed to undergo EMT due to
transcriptional differences that enable utilization of specific transcription factors or signaling pathways. Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that certain PDAC cells are transcriptionally primed to undergo EMT
and that EMT heterogeneity further depends upon cell-to-cell variations in kinase-regulated signaling
processes within cell populations. The objective of the work proposed here is to test these hypotheses through
the development of quantitative systems biology methods to study the basis of EMT heterogeneity regulation via
transcriptional and kinase-mediated signaling processes. In Aim 1, an iterative immunofluorescence imaging
pipeline will be developed to gather multiplexed signaling data on populations of PDAC cells treated with different
EMT agonists. Based on preliminary studies, we propose to measure markers for seven distinct signaling
pathway nodes and two EMT markers to create a dataset with nine features measured for thousands of cells for
each experimental condition. We will then apply a mutual information data science approach for the quantitative
identification of the signaling pathways that cooperate to drive robust EMT. Model predictions will be tested using
small molecule inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdowns. In Aim 2, we will use genetic barcoding for the
transcriptomic profiling of EMT-resistant or -compliant lineages within cell populations. Single-cell RNA
sequencing data from cells before and after EMT induction will be analyzed to identify transcriptional states that
preferentially enable PDAC cells to undergo the mesenchymal transition. The relevance of candidate transcripts
for explaining EMT priming will be tested through knockdown experiments. The methods developed in this work
will be broadly applicable to the study of EMT in other cancer settings and to the study of alternative types of
phenotypic switching. Moreover, the specific results will have implications for the design of novel combination
therapies for PDAC based on the objective of suppressing EMT to promote responsiveness to chemotherapy."

Lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia claims the lives of approximately 4 million people worldwide
each year, making these infections fourth on the list of global causes of death. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the
most common cause of pneumonia leading to death in individuals over the age of 65 eight times more frequently
than those aged 5-49, despite the long-standing availability of a vaccine for this age group (approved in 1983).
In both murine and human systems, there is a greater incidence of, and susceptibility to, pneumococcal infection
in males; nevertheless, the factors contributing to this difference between males and females are unknown.
Therefore, the long-term goal of this study is to gain a greater understanding of the immune system in the context
of sex. Specifically, the goal of this proposal is to determine whether sex and/or anatomical location influences
a specific subset of B cells, B1 cells, which provide essential protection and therefore survival from S.
pneumoniae infection through production of natural antibodies.
Antibodies provide defense against infection by binding the pathogen and preventing infection of host cells.
Natural antibodies are present in the absence of infection or intentional immunization. B1 cells’ unique ability to
provide protection against S. pneumoniae is attributed to their production of natural antibodies, which have
unique structural characteristics resulting from their fetal development. Fetal derived B1 cells maintain their
population through a self-renewal process, which is unlike the B cell subset, B2 cells, generated from
hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore, self-renewal is essential for the maintenance of natural antibodies
protective against infection, though little is known about how sex influences self-renewal of B1 cells into old age.
We have demonstrated natural antibody from aged male mice does not provide protection against S.
pneumoniae infection whereas, natural antibody from aged females maintains its protective capacity.
We hypothesize that maintenance of B1 cells through self-renewal is influenced by sex during aging. We
postulate that female B1 cells maintain more productive B1 self-renewal allowing for the differences seen in
susceptibility to infection with sex and age. To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following aims: 1) elucidate
the sex-specific developmental differences regulating B1 cells by examining cell cycle maintenance through a
unique transgenic reporter line combined with examination of self-renewal to determine the functional
consequence of sex, age, and cell cycle activity on the production of protective antibody and 2) determine how
maintenance of self-renewal in humans may mirror the murine system and influence production of natural
antibody. This project will determine how sex influences the maintenance of B1 cell self-renewal and the
subsequent impact on the production of natural antibodies during aging. This further understanding of the
immune system in context to sex will likely suggest new prevention and/or treatment strategies of S. pneumoniae
infection in both male and female aging populations."

Asthma is the #1 chronic disease in childhood: prevention is an unmet need and pressing priority. We are
conducting the first randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 200 high risk children 2-3 years of age
to determine whether 2 years of treatment with omalizumab (anti-IgE) will prevent asthma and/or diminish
asthma severity 2 years after treatment is stopped. Our hypothesis revolves around the role that IgE plays in
the development of persistent asthma by catalyzing allergic type 2 driven recurrent wheezing and augmenting
virally-induced exacerbations in susceptible young children. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility
and power of using new and novel systems-scale network analysis of transcriptional pathways and epigenetic
signatures to assess airway responses in readily obtained nasal samples. We hypothesize that patients who
respond to anti-IgE may have upregulated expression of genes related to antiviral responses, epithelial cell
structure and barrier integrity. This project will allow us to complete the trial and use state of the art epigenomic
and transcriptomic techniques with integrative approaches to explore this hypothesis and examine the role of
specific alterations in Treg cells and antigen-specific T cells in transducing clinical responses seen in the trial.
Our first aim is to complete the trial to assess whether interfering with environmental allergen IgE-mediated
immunological responses can prevent or moderate a progression to asthma in susceptible children. Our
second aim is to examine the relationship between anti-viral and epithelial integrity pathways and the response
to anti-IgE through DNA methylation and transcriptomic signatures and associated effects on Type 2
inflammation, wheezing episodes, asthma, and asthma severity. We will extend our findings to include single-
cell transcriptional profiling in a subset to more fully inform the cellular sources of bulk transcriptome responses
and provide important molecular details about individual cell heterogeneity and rare cell populations that relate
to clinical responsiveness and clinical outcomes. We will integrate multi-omic and clinical data and perform
analyses to define the combined transcriptomic and epigenetic changes underlying response to anti-IgE
treatment and the persistence or resolution of benefit (including asthma outcome) following cessation of
therapy. These signatures will provide comprehensive mechanistic insights on clinical treatment effects of
responders vs. non-responders, and specific DNA methylation and gene expression molecular pathways that
impact study outcomes and elucidate the disease modifying effects of anti-IgE. Differences in these profiles
could provide potential biomarkers predictive of clinical and immunologic response to anti-IgE. This study is
potentially paradigm shifting – regardless of the outcomes of the trial, we will gain considerable knowledge on
the pathophysiology of the disease and the impact of interfering with IgE mediated processes at a critical time
period where the immunologic and clinical phenotype is evolving but not yet fully established."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that shape an effective cellular response is a primary goal in biology.
One critical regulator of cell function is the process of signal transduction that enables cells to respond rapidly
and specifically to cues in the surrounding environment. These cues can be biochemical or biophysical. The
dynamic interplay of signaling partners along signaling pathways and the rapid turnover of post-translational
modifications are critical components necessary to create a highly sensitive system. Strict regulation of signal
transduction is crucial for normal cellular processes, while unregulated signaling is an important component in
the pathogenesis of many diseases. Fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of how protein interactions
and dynamics control signaling. The research proposed in this MIRA renewal application seeks to understand
the fundamental mechanisms through which biochemical and mechanical cues fine-tune the signaling response.
We propose that this fine-tuning is achieved by modulation of dynamic and stochastic behavior of protein-protein
interactions that are integrated to produce a specific signaling outcome. The overarching theme of our research
is to elucidate how the composition and dynamics of signaling complexes define signaling specificity and
outcome. Our central question is that of how multiple membrane receptors collaborate to interpret multiple
environmental cues, be they physical or chemical, and how the resulting information is integrated to define the
cellular response. To get at these central questions in cell signaling, we initially focus on two signaling systems:
FcεRI, the primary immunoreceptor on mast cells that is involved in allergy/asthma, and receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) that drive oncogenesis. We will determine how FcεRI and associated integrins can translate antigen
geometry and surrounding substrate stiffness into specific outcomes. We will develop a better understanding of
how crosstalk between two RTKs, EGFR and RON, is controlled through the study of the dynamics and
composition of EGFR/RON signaling complexes along with the effect of different ligands on complex formation.
Parallel study of these two systems allows us to identify conserved mechanisms, enabling us to move the broad
field of cellular signal transduction forward in new directions. We use unique and innovative imaging techniques
to provide quantitative information on the composition and dynamics of signaling complexes - as they form on
intact cells - that cannot be obtained using traditional biochemical or structural techniques. The unique
quantitative information that we obtain will address challenging supramolecular questions that have evaded the
field thus far, bring new perspectives to cell biological processes and providing new therapeutic understanding."

Trauma remains the leading cause of death among people younger than 46 years of age and is the leading
cause of years of potential life lost among those younger than 65. With more lives saved, trauma morbidity has
increased, which has consequently revealed a lack of understanding of the impact of trauma survivorship on the
patients’ quality of life and long-term recovery. Severe injury when followed by chronic critical illness leads to
persistent anemia, and the use of blood transfusions is associated with a linear increase in infectious
complications. These conditions are due to prolonged bone marrow dysfunction associated with an exaggerated
catecholamine response, chronic stress, and systemic inflammation. The Principal Investigator (PI) has
demonstrated significant productivity over the last decade, especially in the last five years, in this research field.
The PI’s laboratory has conducted human and rodent research to establish that there are unique bone marrow
transcriptomic differences related to inflammation, the innate immune response, and known inhibitors of
erythropoiesis following trauma. The laboratory has also discovered that chronic stress after trauma contributes
to persistent anemia with impaired iron and erythropoietin function along with the prolonged loss of hematopoietic
stem progenitor cells (HSPC) from the bone marrow. Chronic stress after trauma also induces an altered
microbiome with decreased alpha and beta diversity and changes in microbial composition leading to a persistent
‘pathobiome’. All of these factors influence outcomes. We hypothesize that there is a unifying interaction between
stress, inflammation, and the microbiome and this has an overall role in the regulation of HSPC and erythroid
progenitor cell fate and function following trauma and critical illness. Therefore, the overarching goal for this
application is to build upon this foundation and expand our understanding of HSPC fate and function following
trauma, including examining interventions aimed at reducing stress/inflammation and restoring the microbiome,
thus, improving long-term outcomes. Severely injured patients with chronic critical illness at risk of long-term
morbidity as well as our novel preclinical rodent model of multicompartmental trauma and chronic stress will be
employed. We intend: (1) to directly link changes in HSPC and erythroid progenitor cell fate and function with
changes in the microbiota by examining specific mechanisms, including how stress-induced changes following
trauma create a pathobiome that maintains altered erythroid progenitor function. With these studies, we will (2)
explore the unique interplay of the microbiome, the stress response, and HSPCs and erythroid progenitor cell
fate in different cohorts of trauma, evaluating both age and sex; and (3) consider possible interventions that
restore the microbiome and/or reduce chronic stress/inflammation which reestablishes HSPC homeostasis to
improve bone marrow function and long-term outcomes. Focusing on longitudinal interactions between the
dysregulated stress response, the pathobiome, and HSPC fate is a novel, under-explored area of research that
could improve the long-term management of severe trauma."

Our laboratory is involved in structure-function studies of DNA replication. Over the next five years we propose
to carry out two related projects, one focusing on human DNA replication and the other on replication of herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) DNA. Knowledge gained from these projects about the structural basis of the
fundamental processes enabling precise replication of human genome and replication of viral DNA will provide
a foundation for the development of novel therapies to treat a wide variety of diseases.
Project 1. High-fidelity genome replication is the foundation of healthy life. The bulk of human DNA replication
is performed by the B-family DNA polymerases. Primase-polymerase α (Primosome) synthesizes chimeric
RNA-DNA primers, before switching them to Polε and to Polδ for the start of leading and lagging strands
replication, respectively. Despite recent progress in structural studies of B-family DNA polymerases, significant
gaps remain in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms of their function. This incomplete understanding
warrants additional study, especially of the determinants that tightly coordinate polymerase transactions at the
replication fork. Consequently, revealing step by step the details of human DNA replication events and the
coordinated action of the involved proteins remains a key project in our laboratory and is the major focus of the
current project. Recently, based on the initial structural and functional characterization of Primosome, we
proposed a new direction of study examining how the C-terminal domain of the primase large subunit, along
with a chimeric RNA-DNA primer, fulfills the role of global regulator of transactions at the replication fork. Here,
we will expand these studies using multiple approaches to characterize human Primosome transactions.
Project 2. The human herpesvirus (HHV) family includes eight members grouped into α, β, and γ subfamilies,
which cause a variety of diseases. The replisomes of all HHVs require six essential components: a single-
strand DNA-binding protein, a two-subunit DNA polymerase complex, and a three-subunit helicase-primase
(HP) complex. Approved therapies for HHV infections mainly target inhibition of the polymerase subunit, but
the HP complex is an even more attractive target since its DNA unwinding and primer synthesis functions
precede the processive polymerization. The search for HP inhibitors (HPIs) is ongoing, but success has been
limited to α-HHVs. Improvement of current HPIs and the development of novel HPIs targeting the members of
the β and γ subfamilies are complicated by the lack of knowledge about HP structures and function, as well as
the detailed mechanism of inhibition. HP is an attractive target for comparative analysis with its human
counterpart, since the DNA unwinding and primer formation by HP subunits occur in a significantly compact
complex and requires precise coordination of both activities. Here, we propose to commence studies of HHV
replication with comprehensive structure-function analysis of HSV1 HP and its mechanism of inhibition."
10766155,"The majority of deafness and vestibular disorders occur due to loss or dysfunction of critical cells in the inner
ear, including hair cells, supporting cells and neurons. Once lost or impaired, these cell types show little or no
ability to regenerate in the mammalian inner ear. In recent years, there have been a number of exciting results
regarding approaches to generate new hair cells in the endogenous epithelium, often through transformation of
existing supporting cells. The Notch signaling pathway has been shown to be a key pathway in regulating the
determination of the hair cell or supporting cell fate, through a process called lateral inhibition. In this system,
cells expressing the Notch ligand activate Notch in the surrounding cells and prevent them from adopting a hair
cell fate. This signaling creates the sensory mosaic in which each hair cell is surrounded by supporting cells.
Inhibition of Notch can promote the conversion of supporting cells into hair cells, providing an avenue for
replacing lost or dysfunctional hair cells. However, Notch signaling is a powerful pathway that often plays
multiple roles during development. Our preliminary results indicate that in addition to cell fate choices, Notch
also plays an essential role in cochlear maturation or maintenance via the JAG1 ligand. Specifically, our
results demonstrate that JAG1 deletion does not cause cell fate alterations but instead leads to hearing deficits
resembling auditory neuropathy in humans. We hypothesize that activation of Notch via the JAG1 ligand is
required for aspects of sensory maturation and/or maintenance in the cochlea. The proposal outlined here
aims to test this hypothesis, by (1) establishing the effects of deletion of Jag1 in the cochlear epithelium, (2)
identifying the cell type and receptors that mediate JAG1 effects, and (3) establishing direct and indirect targets
for JAG1-Notch1 signaling. Understanding the role of Notch signaling in postnatal maturation and sensory
maintenance is essential for future regenerative therapies that rely on manipulating Notch signaling for hair cell
replacement.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide with abnormalities
in the stress response circuitry and central autonomic network. Many of these regions are sexually dimorphic
and related with sex differences in mood and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation, the
dysregulation of which is associated with alterations of hormone and immune responses to stress, autonomic
dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk. The overall clinical discovery mission of this SCORE proposal
is to identify the sex-dependent impact of stress-immune pathway dysregulation, beginning in fetal
development, on mood circuitry, MDD per se, immune physiology, and central and peripheral vascular
function in midlife. The primary goal of Project 2 is to use non-invasive neuromodulatory stimulation of the
vagus (i.e., autonomic nervous system) to target the circuitry associated with stress-immune function and
map its neuroanatomic and physiological effects in MDD by sex. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), FDA-
approved for MDD, modulates brain circuitry implicated in mood/anxiety and autonomic regulation, however,
it is implanted and thus invasive. We propose the use of a physiologically-enhanced transcutaneous VNS
(tVNS) as a low risk, non-invasive, and inexpensive alternative. While tVNS has had beneficial effects on
depressive symptomatology and autonomic regulation, current stimulation parameters are based on
historical iVNS data that included mostly male populations. We propose that tVNS effects on the regulation
of specific brainstem-cortical pathways is modulated by sex. Moreover, as the dorsal medullary vagal system
operates in tune with respiration, we recently demonstrated that tVNS can be optimized by gating stimulation
to respiration. Thus, Project 2 proposes to identify the sex-dependent impact of expiratory-gated tVNS on the
modulation of stress response circuitry alterations and physiological dysregulation of recurrent MDD. We will
evaluate a sample of 80 adults with recurrent MDD (ages 51-64, equally divided by sex) randomized to
receive active tVNS or active sham stimulation (earlobe stimulation) during a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) session. The fMRI session will include a stress challenge designed to elicit a sympatho-
excitatory state, with simultaneous mood and physiological assessments, including hormonal and dynamic
cardiovagal heart rate variability (HRV) evaluations. We hypothesize that expiratory-gated tVNS will
effectively modulate specific brainstem-cortical pathways of the stress response circuitry and will attenuate
physiological deficits of recurrent MDD patients. We further hypothesize that tVNS will impact brain activity
and physiology in sex-dependent ways. Although Project 2 is not a clinical trial or intervention, ultimately,
translation of results may lead to a novel sex-dependent intervention with beneficial effects prior to later-life
health outcomes associated with MDD.

anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, neuroendocrine function and autonomic nervous system responses to
stress. Developmental programming, the permanent adaptation of the fetus to maternal environmental signals
can elevate fetal glucocorticoids to program neurodevelopment. Preliminary data in mice and rats show sex-
biased changes following late-gestation exposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. These
include increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and hyperreactive neuroendocrine and autonomic
nervous system responses to stress and changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus. In all cases, adult
females showing a greater change than males. We hypothesize that these adult dysfunctions have a common
mechanism related to programmed changes in the hypothalamic paraventricular n. (PVN), a brain region that
has been shown to influence all of these physiological endpoints. Our studies show similar responses in both
rats and mice allowing these studies to exploit the well-described physiology of the rat as well as the power of
mouse genetic approaches. 3 specific aims are described. Aim 1 will determine the causal factors for long-
term alterations in anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors, neuroendocrine response to stress and an imbalance
of the autonomic nervous system. Moreover, this aim will examine the central renin-angiotensin system as a
central mediator of the observed changes in brain function following prenatal glucocorticoid overexposure.
Aim 2 will determine the impact of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure on connectivity between hypothalamic
preautonomic and brainstem autonomic nuclei and use mouse genetic approaches and viral vectors to
specifically activate neuron populations in the PVN. Aim 3 will use transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation to
modulate autonomic nervous system balance and reverse the effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure on
adult behaviors, neuroendocrine, and autonomic responses to stress. The results of these studies will identify,
not only the brain circuitry underlying the sex-biased developmental programming of behavioral, endocrine and
autonomic responses in adulthood, but also reveal potential therapeutic mechanisms whereby these changes
can be reversed in adulthood."

Our poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the cognitive and behavioral impairments
that characterize FTD stands as a critical barrier to identifying effective treatments. This project will seek to
address this gap in knowledge by examining how SUMOylation, a post-translational modification that our labs
found to be impaired in FTD models, controls Tau aggregation and pathological action of Tau on mitochondrial
and synaptic functions in animal models as well as patient-derived neurons associated with Tau mutations.
SUMOylation, the covalent and reversible attachment of an 11 kDa SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier)
protein to target proteins, has been implicated in both Tau aggregation and mitochondrial dynamics. There are
three known SUMO paralogs in vertebrate brains, SUMO1-3, with SUMO2 and 3 sharing ~95% sequence
homology (and not functionally differentiated) often collectively referred to as SUMO2/3. While SUMO1
conjugation to Tau was previously reported to promote its aggregation and mislocalization, we found that
SUMO2 conjugation reduces Tau aggregation and restores its normal distribution in neurons. Moreover, we
found that animal models of FTD, expressing the Tau mutations P301S (PS19 mice) show: 1) deficits in
mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes (RCE) activities, as well as impaired synaptic function (LTP); and 2)
increased SUMO1- and reduced SUMO2- conjugation. Most importantly, overexpression of SUMO2 improved
RCE activities in vitro, as well as LTP and memory in vivo. Furthermore, treating mice with a bioavailable
polypeptide that promotes SUMO2 conjugation (BioSenA), rescued LTP and memory loss in FTD mice. Based
on these preliminary results, we hypothesize that aggregated and mislocalized Tau causes mitochondrial
dysfunction, which results in aberrant SUMOylation and synaptic deficits; and that increasing SUMO2
conjugation rescues oTau-induced defects in mitochondria, and synaptic function and memory, by preventing
Tau aggregation. We will test our hypotheses with the following three specific aims: 1. Determine the causal
relationship between SUMO conjugation and Tau-induced mitochondrial dysfunction; 2. Test whether
overexpression of SUMO1 has a detrimental effect on mitochondrial/synaptic function; 3. Test whether
overexpression of SUMO2 rescues the mitochondrial/synaptic axis dysfunction in FTD models. These aims will
be addressed through a combination of electrophysiological, behavioral, biophysical, and biochemical
techniques in wild-type and genetically modified mice as well as iPSC-derived neurons from FTD patients.
Upon the completion of these experiments, we will identify the mechanisms whereby SUMOylation controls the
development of tau-related impairments in FTD, and test the possibility that interventions that target SUMO2
conjugation could constitute an effective therapeutic approach for their treatment."

The potential for devastating consequences of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis diarrhea in immunocompromised
patients and malnourished children emphasizes the need for a single effective therapy that could be used
syndromically where diagnosis may be delayed or uncertain. This will also be applicable for asymptomatic
presentations of both diseases. The etiologic parasites colonize and reproduce in the small intestines of
mammalian hosts where they are associated with epithelial cells microvilli. Hence, potential for finding dual
therapeutic is high based on common anatomical site of infection. Protein kinase inhibitors have attracted
considerable attention as potential therapeutics since a number of them have been released as drugs in recent
years and many are in various phases of clinical trials. In a semi-High throughput screening of MMV Pathogen
box and Celgene Global Health programs library, we identified dual hitting kinase inhibitors from 2 chemical
scaffolds. The scaffolds offer new medicinal chemistry opportunities for development of effective multi-parasite
therapeutics against cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. This research proposal capitalizes on these preliminary
findings to hypothesize that effective single agent therapy that could be used syndromically for treatment of either
cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis is possible. Analogues of the 2 scaffolds already in hand and newly synthesized
in Aims 1a will be screened in Aims 2a to determine in vitro efficacy in blocking parasites growth using direct
phenotypic screening to develop structural activity relationship. We will also be collecting other standard in vitro
ADMET and physicochemical parameters such as solubility, stability in simulated gastric/intestinal fluids, and
mouse/human microsome stabilities, in-house hERG assay etc as Go/NoGo filters. Criteria for moving forward
to in vivo studies will include dual parasites killing efficiency, selectivity, static vs. cidal, stability in both gastric
fluids and gut Phase 1 metabolism, and ease of medicinal chemistry development. Since necessary factors for
clinical relevance have not been established in these scaffolds, we will use early leads from Aims 2b to define
the PK/PD properties necessary for optimum animal in vivo efficacy in Aim 2b. We will perform further in vitro
safety profiling for early leads focused on further improving selectivity including quantitative proteomic analysis
of offtarget safety kinases, cytochrome P450 isoenzyme activities and metabolite identification in Aims 1c. Using
medicinal chemistry based iterative reasoning to synthesize analogs, we will do lead optimization for efficacy,
selectivity, PK/ADMET properties, in vivo efficacy and resistance under Aim 1b. In Aim 3; optimized leads will
be evaluated for clinical usefulness with experiments to define any liabilities related to CYP activities, mammalian
kinome profile, AMES test, micronucleus assay and a safety panel of human receptors and ion channels. Other
experiments will include final toxicology studies, additional resistance studies and metronidazole combination
studies. The product of this research study would be useful as parasitic diarrheal therapeutic with the potential
for broad spectrum activity. It will have significant public health benefits in many developing regions of the world."
10774949,"Our training program brings together twenty-three faculty members from ten departments to focus on two areas

10879048,"PROJECT SUMMARY. This direct to Phase II SBIR proposal will study Appa Health, an adolescent-facing
mental health smartphone and computer app. Appa combines (1) delivery of short-form digital evidence-based
mental health content, emphasizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, via educational videos delivered by mental
health experts who are internet influencers, with (2) trained and supervised near-peer mentors with relatable
lived experiences who use supportive accountability to facilitate adolescents’ use of the evidence-based
content. According to Appa’s theory of change, near-peer mentoring directly impacts adolescents’ mental
health and well-being via relational and instrumental support, but also indirectly through the acquisition of
evidence-based skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation) taught via educational videos. We will
examine the psychosocial mechanisms of the two primary elements of Appa, establish the effectiveness of
Appa on adolescent depression and anxiety, other measures of functioning, and theoretical mechanisms, and
examine the cost-effectiveness of the full Appa experience as well as a video-only condition that Appa is
considering marketing. Aim 1 will collect initial data and improve study procedures via a small pilot study.
Seventy-five adolescents aged 13-18 with elevated scores on measures of depression and/or anxiety will be
randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) near-peer mentoring and digital tools (Full Appa), (2) digital
content only (Appa Light), and (3) waitlist control. Results will be used to optimize methodology to achieve
study goals with minimum burden and maximum retention. Aims 2 & 3 will examine Appa’s cost and
effectiveness via a well-powered randomized clinical trial replicating the pilot trial using 400 adolescents.
Variables will include clinical outcomes such as adolescent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and well-being,
as well as treatment mechanisms and proximal outcomes. Because of the mental health workforce shortage,
this study will have an impact on science by demonstrating the effectiveness of using laypersons (near-peer
mentors) combined with expert digital content delivery and clinical supervision to support adolescents’ mental
health. This study is innovative in the unique combination of near-peer mentoring with evidence-based
content delivered via youth-targeted TikTok-style videos conducted by existing internet influencers. Questions
on how to increase adolescent engagement with and use of evidence-based skills are important to intervention
developers. The data from this study will directly impact Appa’s commercialization plan. Appa is scaling
quickly, expanding from direct-to-consumer sales to partnerships with schools and self-funded employers, both
of which are eager for documented clinical outcomes and identification of replicable mechanisms of change to
ensure quality as Appa scales services. Cost-effectiveness analyses will drive development and design
decisions (e.g., focusing resources on mentorship, content, or the mentorship-content integration), as well as
commercialization decisions regarding target organizations and advertising."
10897976,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Gene therapeutics offer hope to many patients with rare muscle and neuromuscular
diseases. Despite some early successes, several serious off-target safety concerns have compromised their
development due to hepatic toxicities and related immune responses to the adeno-associated viral (AAV)
vectors. The generation of novel capsids with superior muscle specificity could, therefore, revolutionize the
muscle gene therapy space by avoiding the off-target effects that compromise drug efficacy and safety. Our
objective is to engineer novel AAV capsids with muscle tropism that exceeds the current “muscle tropic”
serotypes (e.g. AAV6, AAV8, AAV9, AAVrh74 & MyoAAVs) as none is actually “muscle-specific”. Indeed, all of
these serotypes can transduce other tissues, especially the liver, which is functionally linked to the noted clinical
toxicities. In fact, the liver functions as a sink for these vectors, limiting muscle transduction and elevating the
minimally effective dose. We hypothesize that de-targeting the liver while simultaneously enhancing muscle
tropism is key to improving muscle gene therapy safety and efficacy. Other groups have sought to enhance
muscle tropism using directed evolution. This high throughput method artificially selects capsids with improved
muscle tropism, but cannot also de-target the liver. By contrast, we will use a rational design approach to
simultaneously target known epitopes for liver de-targeting, enhanced AAV-receptor binding and improved
muscle targeting. These include those for improved sialic acid/AAV-receptor binding, impaired liver
targeting/heparin sulfate binding, improved integrin binding and capsids with combined properties. We will also
use AAV6 as liver- and muscle-targeting epitopes are known for this serotype, but not for the other serotypes.
Milestone 1 will develop liver de-targeted/muscle targeted AAV6 capsids using well-established in vivo and in
vitro imaging approaches. Milestone 2 will demonstrate functional efficacy by comparing a Smad7 muscle gene
therapeutic featuring a wild-type AAV6 (AVGN7) to one with a novel optimized AAV6 capsid. These studies are
understandably high risk yet their significance is disproportionately much higher as they will create a liver de-
targeted capsid with improved muscle tropism and as a result, vastly superior safety and efficacy profiles. This
would substantially innovate the muscle gene therapy space primarily by reducing a manufacturing burden that
limits drug use to younger or fewer patients and thus, reducing the overall treatment costs while expanding the
number of potential patient therapies."
11018881,"Project Summary/Abstract
According to the most recent data published by the Global Cancer Observatory, over 900,000
patients worldwide were diagnosed with liver cancer in 2020. For patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer, liver transplantation is the only potentially
curative treatment option. Liver transplantation inevitably involves periods of time where the liver
is removed from blood circulation during procurement. When the liver is connected to the recipient
and blood flow is restored, the ischemia phase damage causes inflammation and coagulation
complications. This ischemia reperfusion (IRinj)ury is a key factor in morbidity and mortality
after transplantation. Furthermore, there is preclinical and clinical evidence that IR injury
leads to cancer recurrence in over 20% of patients within 3 years. Despite these poor outcomes,
there are no approved therapeutics available targeting IR injury during liver transplantation.
Potential therapeutics could improve post-transplant organ function and reduce the risk of
cancer recurrence. This phase I STTR is focused on developing a therapeutic strategy to
decrease IR injury during liver transplantation. We have identified a novel synthetic
oligosaccharide structure called dekaparin, produced exclusively by Glycan Therapeutics, with a
dual mechanism of action. IR injury leads to a hypercoagulable state with a flux of immune
mediators, primarily neutrophils, infiltrating reperfused tissue resulting in tissue damage.
Dekaparin has anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activity and is effective in reducing warm IR-
mediated liver injury in a mouse model that mimics surgical complication. The necessity of dual
activity was demonstrated using other oligosaccharides that have only anticoagulant or anti-
inflammatory activity. Single activity oligosaccharides decreased liver injury when combined
but not when used separately. In this current application, we propose to evaluate dekaparin’s
therapeutic potential against ischemia injury happening during graft procurement and
preservation using an ex vivo model of rat liver perfusion after cold storage. Five tasks are
planned to support this single aim: 1) Complete 10 g synthesis of dekaparin for ex vivo studies; 2)
Establish ex vivo model of isolated perfused rat liver; 3) Evaluate effect of dekaparin on IR injury in
ex vivo model; 4) Use extended criteria liver grafts in ex vivo model with dekaparin; 5) Purify
dekaparin from spent perfusate to recycle material for future use. In Phase II, we will use the ex
vivo model to explore different doses of dekaparin. We will conduct the in vivo orthotopic liver
transplantation model in rats. Lastly, we will evaluate the metastatic ability of circulating tumor
cells in the transplant model with dekaparin treatment to determine tumor recurrence potential."

Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes are involved in the oxidations of ~95% of chemicals, including many drugs,
steroids, and chemical carcinogens. The practical application of P450 research to drug metabolism has been
a notable highlight in the pharmaceutical industry in the past three decades. Many of the leaders in this field
have trained in this laboratory. Variations in P450s are issues in drug-drug interactions, endocrine diseases,
cancer, and other medical problems. Despite some success using directed evolution and protein engineering,
there is still much room for improvement in the development of P450s as biocatalysts. In this proposal, I plan
to address several important questions about human P450 enzymes, including both microsomal and
mitochondrial P450s: Is the Compound I intermediate (FeO3+) the only oxidant involved in P450 reactions,
including steroid C-C bond cleavages? What are the physiological roles of the remaining human P450 orphans
(i.e., the P450s that do not presently have a clear function)? What is the physiological relevance of P450 27C1
in human skin—we know the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme but we do not know the function. What are the
roles of other binding proteins (other than for retinoids) in P450 oxidations of lipophilic physiological compounds?
What is the molecular basis of P450 17A1-cytochrome b5 interactions and is there a potential for developing
drugs for prostate cancer? Techniques to be used include organic synthesis, spectroscopy, enzyme kinetics,
mass spectrometry, proteomics, X-ray crystallography, and cell and molecular biology. Collectively the proposed
experiments will provide useful information about the functions and mechanisms of several human P450s and
have continued relevance in the fields of endocrinology and drug metabolism."

10780366,"Project Summary
Over the past 30 years, the synthesis of small molecules has become commonplace to facilitate drug discovery
and development efforts. Retrosynthesis reduces a structurally complex target molecule into increasingly
structurally simpler intermediates and commercially available starting materials, facilitating the preparation of a
target molecule (also referred to as product) through a series of logical synthetic reactions (i.e., a multi-step
synthetic route) from readily available starting materials or building blocks (referred to as reactants).
Retrosynthetic analysis has become the cornerstone of modern synthetic endeavors and has revolutionized
drug design. The goal of this project is to develop innovative generative AI – the type of AI that can create new
content, to generate synthetic reaction libraries with diverse and feasible reactant molecules to synthesize
given molecules via one-step synthetic reactions, and to evaluate and validate the libraries in laboratories
thoroughly and rigorously. To achieve the goal, we have the following Aims. Aim 1 is to generate diverse and
high-quality synthetic reaction libraries by developing innovative deep graph generative methods for
retrosynthesis prediction. Novel graph neural networks will be developed to best capture and represent
molecular structures for downstream retrosynthesis analysis. Innovative graph-based generative methods will
automate step-by-step modification of target molecules toward their reactants. Aim 2 is to generate diverse and
high-quality synthetic reaction libraries by developing innovative sequence-based methods for retrosynthesis
prediction. Novel sequence-based methods include pre-training strategies, SMILES editing and a
reinforcement learning framework will be developed. Aim 3 is to evaluate the generated synthetic reactions by
domain expertise and laboratory experiments. Successful completion of this project will enable diverse and
high-quality synthetic reaction libraries for any given drug-like molecule, which will be highly significant to
accelerating drug development (e.g., lead generation). More importantly, the project will enable new AI
capacity and infrastructure far beyond the conventional methodologies in synthetic route design. Successful
application of the new methodology is ultimately expected to facilitate rapid retrosynthetic analysis of newly
discovered or complex molecules as well as those with limited availability, enabling chemical synthesis for
subsequent biological evaluations."
10780805,"Project Summary/Abstract
Visceral pain is the cardinal complaint of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), an affliction of
approximately 20% of the U.S. population. Drugs to treat visceral pain are limited, with side effects usually
outweighing analgesic benefits. The development of effective treatments for IBS is hampered by the lack of a
reliable biomarker that quantifies the level of visceral pain. Clinical trials of pain-managing drugs rely on patient
reported pain level, a subjective assessment with a strong placebo effect. This has resulted in challenges in
clinical trials for the tested drugs to significantly out-perform the placebo in managing visceral pain. Thus, an
objective integrated multimodal electrophysiological index that quantifies the level of visceral pain is much
needed in developing novel therapies, especially non-drug treatments in managing IBS pain.
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the primary pathway in brain-gut communication, and it significantly
overlaps with the neural circuitry for detecting and perceiving pain from the viscera. Our preliminary data have
shown close correlation between ANS activities and subject-reported pain responses to noxious somatic and
visceral stimuli. Compared with healthy subjects, IBS patients show an unchecked predominance of sympathetic
activities and desensitized parasympathetic activities. Also, the amount of abdominal muscle contraction,
measured by electromyogram (EMG), has been established as a metric to differentiate IBS from control
populations in preclinical studies. Thus, the ANS and abdominal muscular activities are promising targets for
developing objective biomarkers for IBS pain.
We aim to leverage our recent technical advances in wearable sensing of electrophysiological signals and
telemetric technology to develop a robust, sensitive, and objective biomarker that quantifies the level of visceral
pain through noninvasive recordings of electrodermal activities (EDA), electrocardiogram (ECG), and EMG. Two
specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will use machine learning to establish an objective integrated
multimodal electrophysiological (OIME) index based on EDA, ECG, and abdominal EMG for pain quantification
and clustering of IBS patients. Specific Aim 2 will the integrated OIME index as a biomarker to reliably quantify
visceral pain in IBS patients and stratify the IBS population. If successful, we will establish the OIME index from
abdominal belt-worn recordings of EDA, ECG, and EMG as a sensitive and robust biomarker for IBS-related
visceral pain, which will lead to accelerated development of preventive and therapeutic schemes, especially
nonopioid treatment for effective pain management in IBS."

People with immunocompromising conditions, including end stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal
transplantation, are at increased risk of developing severe infections. Vaccination is the preferred mode of
protection against infections but people with the highest risk of infectious morbidity tend to have poor responses
to vaccines. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) showed excellent efficacy in healthy adults ≥50 years of age
and lower immunogenicity and efficacy in transplant recipients. The goal of this study is to define the immunologic
and metabolomic profiles associated with decreased magnitude and persistence of immune responses to RZV
in people with ESRD before and after transplantation. We will use plasma and PBMC collected in a study of RZV
in ESRD sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, in which participants receive the standard 2-dose RZV immunization
regimen while awaiting renal transplantation and are then followed for 31 months. Transplanted participants on
stable immunosuppression are randomized to receive a 3rd dose of RZV or not and are followed for 12 additional
months. Responses of these immunocompromised hosts are compared with responses of healthy adults ≥50
years of age, who received RZV in previous studies. Research questions will be addressed in the following Aims:
Aim 1. Identify immunologic and metabolomic correlates of reduced persistence of immune responses
to RZV in people with ESRD. We will compare adaptive and innate memory responses to RZV in 50 ESRD
and 50 healthy older adults using flow cytometric and single cell immunogenomic approaches and identify factors
associated with persistence. Using systems and computational immunology approaches, we will identify pre-
vaccination phenotypic, functional, and genomic immune cell profiles, and inflammatory and metabolomic
characteristics associated with decreased responses to RZV in people with ESRD. Associations of inflammatory
factors and/or metabolites with characteristics that hamper the immune responses to RZV will be verified in vitro.
Aim 2. Define the effect of renal transplantation and of a 3rd dose of vaccine on immune responses to
RZV. We will compare adaptive and innate memory responses to a 3rd dose of RZV administered to 30 transplant
recipients with responses to the standard RZV regimen in 50 healthy and 50 ESRD older adults using flow
cytometry and single cell immunogenomics. We will analyze the T-cell repertoire to define the effect of induction
regimens and of the 3rd dose of RZV on the persistence of RZV-expanded T cell clones. We will determine pre-
vaccination immunologic and metabolomic profiles associated with responses to the 3rd dose of RZV in transplant
recipients.
Impact. This study will identify actionable inflammatory and/or metabolomic factors and immunogenomic
characteristics associated with decreased responses to RZV in people with ESRD with and without
transplantation and will determine if a 3rd dose of RZV can mitigate the negative effect of transplantation on the
persistence of immune responses to RZV. We will leverage prior NIH- and GlaxoSmithKline-funded studies."

10777799,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains deadly despite two FDA approved therapies. Modifiable
intermediate molecular markers and other metrics for disease severity and progression remain unmet needs
for aiding drug development and clinical decision-making. Advances in image analysis enable objective
detection and quantitation of anatomy, while high-dimensional images can identify sub-visual characteristics,
often termed radiomic features – often called Quantitative CT (QCT). Data-driven texture analysis is a
previously validated method of QCT and a powerful prognostic marker. We seek to evaluate radiomic features
alone and in conjunction with other disease dimensions for prognostication and response to treatment in IPF.
The parent PRECISIONS project has completed Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA seq and proteomics on
over 1,600 ILD cases recruited thru the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation Registry (PFF-PR) generating novel
markers of disease progression. The PRECISIONS clinical trial tests the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in 200
IPF patients with a TOLLIP polymorphism. However, follow-up quantitative CT is not currently included in the
trial. Our overall objectives are to identify and validate radiologic features, and intermediate response to
therapy, and understand where to position these powerful QCT markers. We hypothesize that DTA scores will
enhance prediction of disease progression, in conjunction with molecular markers. This ancillary proposal will
add CTs to the PRECISIONS trial cohort and use a registry UVA/Chicago real world cohort for replication. In
Aim 1, we will validate quantitative CT and radiomic markers for disease progression by independent
replication for prediction of progression. We will collect baseline and 1-year HRCTs in UVA/Chicago, and
PRECISIONS trial participants to evaluate: a) the prognostic value of baseline quantitative CT and radiomic
markers (i.e. DTA) in predicting time to progression, b) associations between changes in CT biomarkers on
sequential CT and changes in 1-year FVC and DLCO, and c) change in CT associated with drug treatment. In
Aim 2: We will determine if candidate genetic variants for IPF susceptibility and survival associate with DTA
score and improve predictive performance for survival. We will perform a cross-sectional analysis of PFF-PR
cases comparing quantitative CT and radiomic markers at baseline with and without “at risk” genotypes for
association with severity, and progression (decline in FVC over time). Findings will be replicated in
UVA/Chicago cohort and in the prospective PRECISIONS cohort. Lastly, in Aim 3, We will assess if DTA and
radiomic markers are additive/synergistic with plasma protein and blood transcriptome markers for disease
progression. We have chosen published markers from a 4-protein panel signature along with CCL18, as
examples given their current level of replication and promise. Will also include our 25 gene FVC predictor for
disease progression. Similar analyses as outlined in Aims 1 and 2 will determine their additive information
value. Changes in transcriptome and plasma levels over time may also offer measures of drug response."

Neuroinflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and links strongly with
AD’s neuropathological hallmarks, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While there have
been tremendous strides over the last decade in the development of novel cerebrospinal fluid, blood-based
assays, positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, there still is
a desperate need for a clinical imaging modality that can reliably image and quantify neuroinflammation in the
aging brain and facilitate the identification of the key pathological players in different stages of AD. To address
this unmet need and response to FOA “PAR-21-038”, we propose a new research direction to develop and
establish a brand-new diffusion MRI (dMRI) technique, Diffusion Dictionary Imaging (DDI), as a safe,
specific endogenous, and economical solution for the neuroinflammation imaging in AD. By tracking the
random walk of water molecules using FDA-approved diffusion MRI sequence and compressed sensing
technique, DDI measures and specifically extracts the microstructural changes associated with the activation
and infiltration of the microglia and astrocyte in AD. Moreover, the previously collected dMRI data can be
retrospectively analyzed with this new technique. Therefore, we are in a unique position to cost-effectively
develop DDI by leveraging the longitudinal data-rich studies from the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center (ADRC) at Washington University (>800 Sporadic AD participants) and the multi-site international
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study (>500 autosomal-dominant AD [ADAD]
participants). In this project, we will develop the DDI technique and evaluate its capability of imaging
neuroinflammation in the postmortem AD brains (Aim 1). We will examine the associations between the DDI
neuroinflammation index and CSF and plasma inflammation biomarkers (YKL-40, sTREM2, and GFAP) in the
Knight ADRC and DIAN cohorts (Aim 2). We will also cross-sectionally and longitudinally quantify the
neuroinflammation using DDI in the Knight ADRC and DIAN cohorts and examine its connections with amyloid
deposition and tauopathy measured by PET tracers and clinical outcomes (cognitive and progression) (Aim 3).
The successful development of a quantitative endogenous DDI imaging biomarker of neuroinflammation will
represent an important technological leap forward. The integration of DDI neuroinflammation biomarker into the
DIAN and other clinical trial studies will provide clinically feasible neuroimaging surrogates that can significantly
improve our understanding of the role of neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis."

Metastatic brain tumors are the most commonly observed intracranial tumors. Patients with advanced breast
cancer have a high propensity to metastasize to the brain with human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; estrogen and progesterone receptor and Her2 negative)
subtypes showing the highest incidence of brain metastases. To effectively treat multiple highly aggressive brain
metastatic breast tumors (BMBT), there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics that target aberrant signaling
pathways in tumor cells and the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of BMBT. Recently, we have
shown that intrathecal (IT) and intracarotid artery (ICA) injection of adult allogeneic “off the shelf” mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) expressing bifunctional protein simultaneously targeting EGFR and (DR)4/5), EvDRL have
therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of BMBT that mimic clinical settings. These findings although promising,
have raised fundamental questions on the potential of combining MSC released EvDRL induced tumor cell killing
with therapeutic agents that simultaneously activate immune effector functions against BMBT. Our recently
published studies indicate that DRL (TRAIL) component of EVDRL is the key driver of EVDRL mediated cell death
in patient derived BMBT cells. Previous studies have shown that in addition to tumor cells, DRL induces
apoptosis in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ Tregs and simultaneously
increases recruitment of CD8+ T cells in the TME. Furthermore, clinical and pre-clinical studies using combined
cytotoxic therapy and immune checkpoint (ICI) blockade have shown increased efficacy in breast metastatic
tumors thus offering the potential to combine of MSC-EVDRL with immunomodulatory agents to treat BMBT. In
this proposal, we will first evaluate the efficacy and influence of MSC-EVDRL induced tumor cell death in the TME
in humanized (hu) NSG breast to brain metastatic tumor models generated from BMBT cells that have varying
response to EVDRL mediated apoptosis. Next, we will create bimodal MSC releasing EVDRL and anti-
programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 nanobodies (Nb-PD1) and evaluate the mechanism combined efficacy of
engineered MSC in huNSG breast to brain metastatic tumor models. We hypothesize that human MSC-EvDRL
will lead to specific killing of local and widely disseminated BMBT cells and Nb-PD1 will target T cells recruited to
the TME. To ease clinical translation, we will incorporate activatable kill switch/PET imaging agent, herpes
simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) into MSC and assess their fate by PET imaging and selective
eradication mediated by HSV-TK activation. Given that engineered MSC are in phase I clinical trial in non-small
cell lung cancer patients; a phase I/II trial using IT of anti-PD-1 antibody is currently ongoing in leptomeningeal
metastatic patients; and our MSC-DRL therapy in primary brain tumor (GBM) patients is under consideration by
FDA; successful execution of the proposed studies will facilitate translation of our strategy into clinics. We
anticipate that our findings will have a major contribution towards developing novel mechanism based targeted
therapies for BMBT and thus a major impact in saving the lives of many metastatic breast cancer patients."

While anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapy has been a watershed for the treatment of wet
AMD (age-related macular degeneration), approximately 50% of patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy exhibit
persistent disease activity, which can include persistent fluid exudation (edema), fibrosis, hemorrhage, and
limited vision recovery. Blocking VEGF only addresses the formation of leaky and new vessels, but not fibrosis.
Reducing fibrosis in concert with blocking leakiness and vessels may preserve vision and stop progression of
neovascular AMD. Our long-term objective is to develop a translatable delivery system for AMD that can
address the multifactorial nature of the disease and can be adjusted remotely via ultrasound for on-demand
treatment as needed. Our objective in this project is to focus on the sustained delivery of two drugs that have
been shown to address two of the critical components of wet AMD: neovascularization and fibrosis. We
propose to deliver acriflavine, a HIF-1alpha inhibitor that prevents neovascularization in the eye, with
pirfenidone, an antifibrotic drug, via a long-term delivery system based on polyurethane nanocapsules that
deliver each drug over a prolonged period of time and can be triggered for on-demand release using
ultrasound. We hypothesize that the controlled, long-term delivery of these two molecules in concert will lead
to better, long-term outcomes including preservation of retinal tissue and visual acuity."

Psychological studies have shown that social judgments from faces are ubiquitous, automatic, very rapid, and play critical roles in human social behavior, in both health and disease. The proposed project seeks to understand the neural mechanisms responsible. The goal of our study is to go beyond merely identifying the brain regions where social attributes of faces are represented, and to discover the mechanisms whereby we go from perceptual representations to social knowledge. To achieve this goal, we leverage the high temporal resolution of our recordings, the broad coverage of relevant brain areas that will be sampled, and the innovative analysis tools we have developed. The strengths of our data- driven approach will be as follows: (i) Predictive modeling with variance partitioning as a function of time will reveal what aspect of social judgments is attributable to visual features (shared variance). We will identify the specific set of visual features that are predictive and establish a mapping between these visual features and social representations as a function of time for each brain area, thereby providing fine-grained data on how social attribution representations emerge at specific points in time and in specific brain regions. This approach is designed to elucidate the mechanisms that bind perceptual face information with social knowledge. (ii) Contextual and electrical stimulation manipulations will experimentally perturb the relationship between visual features and social representations. Geometric analysis of the structure of the population code allows us to assess how specific social judgments are suppressed or amplified, thereby establishing a mechanism for how context changes the mapping between faces and the social attributions we established as part of (i). (iii) Decoding analysis will assess what aspect of the visual-social mapping is predictive of behavior in a given trial, thereby identifying a mapping between internal representations of social attributions and the actual choices patients make in a given trial. (iv) Inter-areal interaction analysis and latency comparisons will establish when information about a given social attribution is first available and how this information spreads to other anatomical nodes. Simultaneous recordings from multiple brain areas present a rare and unique opportunity to assess the role of directional interactions. We will use complementary measures of inter-areal spike-field coherence, Granger causality analysis, phase coupling, lagged correlation (during rest and experimental conditions), and dynamic resting-state iEEG connectivity as well as the measure of repeated single-pulse stimulations (also known as cortico-cortical evoked potentials). Our project will provide a new and dynamic picture of the brain where populations of individual cells in a distributed network interact together in time and space to enable the human brain to extract socially relevant information from faces"
10776350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Innervation plays a key role in muscle development, function, and regeneration. Therefore, tissue engineering
strategies to develop biomimetic skeletal muscle to study developmental mechanisms as well as for regenerative
medicine applications should consider the implications of neural inputs during the biofabrication process.
Moreover, tissue regeneration following severe musculoskeletal injuries like volumetric muscle loss (VML) is
hindered by a lack of appropriate motor innervations, which diminishes regenerative capacity and often results
in minimal functional recovery. Hence, there is an unmet clinical need for an intervention strategy that augments
reinnervation and promotes a pro-regenerative environment following severe musculoskeletal trauma. Over the
last several years, our group has shown that pre-innervated tissue engineered muscle scaffolds can effectively
enhance muscle regeneration, revascularization, and functional recovery following VML. Building on these
findings, the goal of the current program is to advance the first three-dimensional tissue engineered motor units
(3D-TEMUs) comprising dense bundles of centimeter-scale myofiber fascicles innervated by preformed axonal
networks projecting from discrete pools of motor and/or sensory neurons. The 3D-TEMUs will be validated as
an in vitro testbed to study the role of innervation in facilitating muscle development as well as a composite soft
tissue to augment functional regeneration following implantation in a rodent model of VML. Notably, 3D-TEMUs
will be generated using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived myocytes and motor/sensory
neurons to perform in-depth characterization using a clinically-relevant and potentially translatable biomass.
These efforts will be carried out across 3 Specific Aims. First, human 3D-TEMUs will be optimized to recapitulate
the native myofascicular architecture of skeletal muscle tissue in order to provide a biofidelic testbed to better
understand neuromuscular development and sensorimotor function in the context of myofiber formation and
maturation as well as to refine tissue engineering strategies for augmenting muscle regeneration (Aim 1). Next,
3D-TEMU neurons will be transduced to contain optogenetically controlled (i.e., light-activated) motor inputs that
allow for spatiotemporal control of muscle-fiber contraction to demonstrate refinement of motor units over time
and to measure sensorimotor function (Aim 2). Then, 3D-TEMUs will be implanted in a rat model of VML to
optimize acute graft cell survival (Aim 3A) followed by chronic studies assessing the ability of 3D-TEMUs in
facilitating bulk muscle replacement, reinnervation, revascularization, and overall functional restoration (Aim
3B). Successful execution of these studies will significantly advance the development of 3D-TEMUs as both an
in vitro testbed to study mechanisms of neuromuscular development as well as an implantable composite soft
tissue to enable functional regeneration following currently intractable VML. With further advancement and
clinical translation, 3D-TEMUs could potentially change the surgical paradigm for muscle repair and
fundamentally alter clinical expectations for functional recovery following major musculoskeletal trauma."

HIV and injury are substantial public health problems, which disproportionately occur in low-and middle-income
countries (LMICs); with the majority of morbidity and mortality levied in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in countries
such as Kenya. Although HIV and injury are immense problems, there is a paucity of study of their intersection.
Additionally, those most likely to need emergent injury care are young adults and males, key groups for HIV
services that have not been adequately engaged in HIV programs in SSA. This epidemiologic concordance of
injury in neglected HIV groups represents an opportunity to increase testing during the provision of commonly
sought emergency care; a known period for personal health growth in young adults. However, as facility based
opt-out HIV testing has been challenging in SSA, and Kenya specifically, novel approaches to improve testing
among populations with unique needs are required. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is an innovative strategy, which is
endorsed by the Kenyan Ministry of Health as a method to increase HIV care among high-risk groups, such as
young adults and males, but has never been leveraged in SSA emergency care to enhance HIV testing.
 This research aims to address knowledge gaps in the study of HIV and emergency injury care in
Kenya. The proposed work will generate robust quantitative and qualitative data on characteristics of
emergency department (ED) HIV care as well as barriers and opportunities to care, and the use of HIVST to
augment testing in the difficult to access young adult and male populations seeking treatments. Subsequently,
implementation science using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, which has not been employed
prior in SSA acute care research, will be used to efficiently evaluate the innovative delivery of ED based HIVST
among patients and providers. These studies will provide crucial foundational data for future large-scale multi-
site implementation trials which will inform global policy on the interface of HIV and emergency care in SSA as
well as the use HIVST to enhance care delivery in previously missed LMIC populations (i.e. young males).
 My long-term career goal is to become a highly trained clinician scientist with expertise in implementation
research and the study of the intersection of HIV and emergency care in LMICs. With the attainment of training
and mentorship through this K23 award, in conjunction with my prior HIV and emergency care research
experiences; I will be able to succeed in that trajectory. My career development aims for this proposal are to
gain in-depth training in implementation science and mixed methods research while generating innovative data
at the intersection of HIV, emergency care and ED-HIVST. Activities from this proposal will facilitate my
transition to being an independent investigator able to design and lead future research studies that will
evaluate the impacts of HIVST and additional ED interventions on testing and linkage to care of index patients
and social / sexual contacts using implementation science trials, complemented by qualitative methods, to
contribute to informing and improving HIV programming in high-risk LMIC populations."

Social relationships develop between individuals with a social network. Difficulties in mediating social
relationships with other individuals is strongly associated with severe mental disorders ranging from
depression, chronic stress, autism and other. Thus, understanding the neural underpinning of social
relationships is paramount. To gain insight that would inform of real-life behavior, I propose to study the
nervous system under real-life conditions in which social interactions in humans and animals typically occur. In
particular, I focus on the fact that social interactions typically involve multiple participants, employ the usage of
a flexible repertoire of communication signals, and occur between individuals of varying social bonds and
personality traits. Furthermore, social relationships evolve over prolonged periods of time in a dynamic fashion.
In this proposal we focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We do so because activity in this area has
previously been strongly associated with social behaviors across a wide range of mammalian species,
including humans. However, much less is known about the neural computations in the ACC with respect to
social relationships, especially during real-life and multi-dimensional social conditions. To do so, we use the
Egyptian fruit bat, a highly social, long-lived mammal that is accustom to group living and where individuals
engage in relationships that extend over many months/years. We further develop advanced behavioral
measurements that allow us to monitor the social interactions of individuals within our colonies continuously
and characterize their social relationships between group members. To study the neural circuits that underlie
social relationships we develop wireless neurophysiological tools that enable monitoring neural activity from
entire colonies of bats simultaneously at cellular and millisecond resolutions (electrophysiology) and over
prolonged periods of time (calcium imaging). This novel approach allows us to consider the true complexity of
real-life social interactions and consider the social bonds between the individuals, the dynamic structure of the
social relationships as well as the individual variability in personality traits. Specifically, we aim to achieve the
following aims: (1) We start by describing the basic neural dynamics in the ACC during semi-natural, dyadic,
social interactions and communication. (2) We next describe the ACC neural dynamics during interaction
occurring within real-life, stable, social networks while considering the relationships between individuals (3) We
describe the evolution of ACC neural dynamic in parallel to the dynamical changes that occur in real-life social
networks. (4) We use optogenetics tools to disrupt neural activity in the ACC during group social interactions in
order to assess its causal role in real-life social relationships with other individuals. Combined, these
experiments will provide a detailed description of ACC neural computations underlying the mediation of social
relationships within a social network. In doing so, we aim for these results to provide important insight that
could be used in clinical future application in patients."

The effective causative therapies for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs) remain elusive
because the patients are often diagnosed at an advanced state of molecular pathology. Clinically difficult differential
diagnosis of early AD is Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome associated
with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration disorders (FTLDs). The development of diagnostic tools and therapies
for AD and ADRDs has been focused on the part of the human genome that encodes proteins. Most of the genome
(97%), however, consists of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which are increasingly recognized as pivotal regulators
of cellular processes. ncRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of brain functions derailed in AD and
ADRDs. ncRNA longer than 200 nucleotides are generally referred to as long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We
hypothesize that lncRNAs expressed in specific cortical cells, become de-regulated in AD and FTLDs, and are
eventually released in circulation, making them potentially specific pathology-associated biomarkers and drug
targets. However, systematic approaches to study lncRNA expression patterns in the brain and in liquid biopsies
in the context of AD and FTLDs are few and there is an urgent need to fill this gap in knowledge. The data we
present demonstrate our ability to discover lncRNAs expressed or enriched in specific neural cell-types and
deregulated in the vulnerable cell populations in brains of AD and FTLDs patients. We developed functional
analysis tools to dissect the role of disease biomarker candidate lncRNAs in relevant model systems. We also
obtained material for testing the expression level and the specificity of our lncRNAs biomarker candidates in the
unprecedented combination of samples from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham
Heart Study (FHS), and clinical studies at German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). In Aim 1 we
will test the hypothesis that the differential expression of lncRNAs in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
hippocampus will discriminate between AD, FTLDs, and control subjects. We have developed a single nucleus
RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) protocol to study the full spectrum of lncRNAs and used this technique to measure
lncRNAs in all major cortical cell-types. Our preliminary data indicate that our newly discovered, cortical cell-type
specific, lncRNAs are deregulated in AD and FTLDs. In Aim 2 we will define the functions of candidate lncRNA
biomarkers in vitro and in vivo to determine the roles of disease-biomarker candidate lncRNAs in relevant model
systems. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that distinct expression patterns of lncRNAs biomarker candidates in
plasma samples of ADNI, FHS, and DZNE studies participants differentiate among cognitively normal elderly
adults, individuals with MCI, and dementia patients meeting clinical criteria for AD or FTLDs. Together, the proposed
experiments will determine how lncRNAome signatures reflect neurodegenerative processes in AD and FTLDs
and serve as disease biomarkers/classifiers to permit subsequent testing of stratified therapeutic approaches
centered on lncRNA in future studies."

This proposal centers on a novel super-enhancer that we initially discovered to coordinate a non-prototypical T
cell response in which effector T cells are triggered to produce the key type 1 cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-
g), independently of the T cell receptor, via stimulation with precise cytokine combinations that are known to
activate certain innate immune cells. In particular, effector T cells synthesize IFN-g in response to a STAT-
activating cytokine (IL-2 or IL-12) plus an IL-1 family member (IL-33, IL-36 or IL-18). Although such ""innate-like""
T cell responses have not been extensively studied, they have been shown to facilitate host defense against
various infections, and may also boost cancer immunotherapy. In analyzing the molecular mechanisms
underpinning innate-like T cell responsiveness, we identified a novel super-enhancer on mouse chromosome 1
that facilitates STAT-activating cytokine-mediated transcription of the genes encoding the receptors for IL-33
and IL-18. Importantly, human GWAS studies identified SNPs in this region (on human chromosome 2) linked to
the IL-33-regulated pathologies asthma and allergy as well as lung cancer. Further, we generated a novel
CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited mouse lacking this super-enhancer, whose conventional CD8 and CD4 T cells
have impaired innate-like capacity. Additionally, Foxp3+ T regulatory cells lacking the super-enhancer exhibit
reduced expression of the IL-33 receptor, that is known to confer suppressor function. These global super-
enhancer knockout mice also exhibit slower rates of tumor growth in the absence of immunotherapy, as well as
increased resistance to endotoxin shock, suggesting that the super-enhancer may also regulate the function of
additional immune cell types. This project will generate a novel conditional super-enhancer knockout mouse
strain that will facilitate studies to precisely define the role of the super-enhancer in different immune cell types
and physiologic and therapeutic settings impacted by IL-33 or IL-18."

Cardiomyopathy is the most frequent clinical manifestation of Chagas disease. The pathogenesis of the
heart disease is attributed to the persistence of T. cruzi leading to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure. Fibrosis results from excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
by terminally differentiated fibroblast (myofibroblasts) in response to injury or illness and leads to organ
disfunction and failure. Interstitial fibrosis occurs in both acute and chronic myocarditis caused by T. cruzi,
and is characterized by the deposition of ECM components. The parasite per se appears to be responsible
since deposition of ECM components (fibronectin, laminin, and collagen) also occurs in cultures of cardiac
myofibroblasts infected by the parasite, where no inflammatory cells are present, and is reversible upon
treatment with the trypanocidal agent posaconazole. Recent work has discovered that polyphosphate
(polyP), acting as a cell signaling molecule, is a potent inducer of fibroblast chemotaxis, myofibroblast
differentiation, and production of ECM components, such as a-smooth muscle actin, stress fibers, and
collagen. We have found that polyP is released by cells such as platelets, and mast cells. PolyP is
abundantly present in all life cycle stages of T. cruzi, reaching cellular mM concentrations, and is located in
acidocalcisomes, glycosomes, nucleoli, and in the outer surface of the parasite. It is not known whether
polyP is also released from T. cruzi although the parasite is able to release extracellular vesicles budding
from the plasma membrane, and the localization of polyP in the outer surface of the parasite suggest that it
is. In summary, there is evidence that: (1) T. cruzi per se stimulates fibroblast to myofibroblast transition
and deposition of ECM components; (2) deposition of ECM components by T. cruzi-infected cardiac
myofibroblasts occurs in the absence of inflammatory cells, (3) polyP is involved in fibroblast chemotaxis,
myofibroblast differentiation, and production of ECM components; and (4) polyP is abundant in T. cruzi and
expressed in the outer surface of the cells and is released in extracellular vesicles (EVs). We will explore
two hypotheses that are related to our recent findings: 1. That T. cruzi surface or released polyP stimulates
fibrosis; and 2. That T. cruzi surface or released polyP is involved in the deposition of ECM components by
myofibroblasts through the activation of signaling cascades."

During vocalization, the nervous system must dissociate vocal feedback from other sounds. To make this
distinction, vocal motor-related signals are harnessed to selectively suppress responses of auditory neurons to
predictable acoustic features of vocal feedback. This predictive suppression enhances the detection of sounds
that occur simultaneously with vocal feedback and also facilitates the detection of vocal errors, a process
important to vocal learning. In contrast, dysfunctional suppression is thought to give rise to auditory
hallucinations in disorders like schizophrenia. The prominence of predictive vocal suppression in the auditory
cortex has been most thoroughly demonstrated with noninvasive recordings in speaking humans and
extracellular recordings from pyramidal neurons in vocalizing monkeys. However, the cellular determinants of
predictive vocal suppression are unknown because the auditory cortex of monkeys and humans is not readily
amenable to advanced genetic methods useful for circuit interrogation. While our group previously found that
mouse auditory cortex was suppressed during vocalization, these recordings were conducted during courtship,
a state that also features locomotion, arousal, and olfactory stimulation, all of which broadly suppress
pyramidal neuron activity. I have developed a novel social interaction paradigm in which I can monitor
vocalizations, locomotion, and arousal while conducting multiphoton imaging the activity of pyramidal neurons
and interneurons in the mouse auditory cortex. I have combined this paradigm with sound presentations to test
the excitability of auditory cortical neurons during vocal and non-vocal social interactions. In Aim 1, I will use
this approach to measure suppression related to vocalization, locomotion, and arousal during social
interactions to test the hypothesis that vocalization corresponds with specific suppression of pyramidal neurons
that respond to vocal feedback and activation of certain interneurons, while non-vocal facets of courtship
suppress a broader population of neurons. In Aim 2.1, I will image from the auditory cortex while systematically
distorting vocal feedback with air enriched with gradations of helium to test the hypothesis that vocal
suppression is predictive of vocal feedback. In Aim 2.2, I will test the hypothesis that vocal suppression relies
on strong activation of interneurons by vocal motor-related signals by imaging from the auditory cortex of
vocalizing, congenitally deaf mice. These experiments will test the specificity and predictive power of vocal
suppression in the mouse auditory cortex while providing cellular resolution of its underlying mechanisms.
Given the similar organization of the human and mouse auditory cortex, my findings will shed light on cortical
circuits that influence vocal perception during human speech and whose dysfunction interferes with
communication and well-being."

T cell trafficking is crucial for development, immune surveillance, and effector function. Migration is a complex
process, choreographed by a host of chemoattractants that signal through GPCRs to direct T cell cytoskeletal
responses. In vivo work shows that chemokines like CCL19 and CCL21 (CCR7 ligands) mediate naïve T cell
migration within lymphoid tissues, while the lipid chemoattractant S1P regulates egress. A similar process occurs
in peripheral tissues, where these signals control migration of migratory effector T cells out of inflamed tissues
and into afferent lymphatics. Our lab recently overcame a longstanding technical problem that made it difficult to
study S1P responses in ex vivo T cells. Using this advance, we discovered that these two chemotactic signals
induce distinct modes of T cell motility. CCL19 induces long-duration lamellipodial migration while S1P induces
a shorter burst of bleb-based motility. This work raises several questions: How do these chemoattractants elicit
such different migratory responses? What do T cells do when confronted with competing cues? Why do T cells
need multiple motile mechanisms? We hypothesize that CCR7 ligands and S1P activate different cytoskeletal
signaling pathways that direct distinct modes of motility, which work alone or in combination to allow T cells to
navigate complex environmental obstacles like those they encounter in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we will carry
out two sets of studies. In Aim 1, we will pursue our preliminary data showing that CCL19 preferentially activates
a Rac1-dependent pathway leading to lamellipodial protrusion, while S1P preferentially activates a pathway
involving RhoA and phospholipase activity, which directs myosin-dependent contractility and bleb formation. To
verify that that these signaling events are causally linked to the migratory responses we observe, we will treat
cells with pharmacological inhibitors and assess motile responses and cytoskeletal remodeling using transwell
assays and live cell imaging. To ask how cells integrate signals from multiple chemoattractants, cells will be
exposed to S1P and CCL19 simultaneously and sequentially, and signaling responses and cell migration will be
analyzed. In Aim 2, we will test the idea that CCL19-induced lamellipodial motility is optimized for long-distance
migration in relatively unconfined settings, while S1P-induced bleb-based motility permits cells to pass through
small, highly confined spaces. To achieve this, we will test chemotaxis within 3D collagen gels and passage
through microfluidic channels with variable geometries that mimic in vivo challenges. As part of this analysis, we
will ask how actin and myosin are redistributed in the cell as a function of chemoattractant stimulus and
confinement. Finally, we will analyze T cell passage across lymphatic endothelial barriers using transwell assays
and tissue explants derived from mouse ears. If successful, this project will complement existing in vivo studies
of T cell trafficking by providing much needed mechanistic insights into the underlying molecular and cell
biological mechanisms. In the long run, our findings will reveal valuable targets for the rational design of
therapeutic approaches based on modulating T cell trafficking."

Several viruses have been shown to induce metabolic reprogramming of host cells to establish productive
infections. One common mechanism utilized by viruses is the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible-factors (HIF).
The HIF complex, comprised of an inducible α subunit (HIF-1α or HIF-2α) and a constitutively expressed β
subunit (HIF-1β), is known to control diverse transcriptional processes in response to hypoxia and other disease
states. The use of both HIF inhibitors and stabilizers has been investigated in models of cancer, autoimmunity,
and non-infectious acute lung injury, with several compounds for both classes currently being tested in phase 3
clinical trials for a variety of clinical disorders. However, there are no publications describing the use of a HIF
specific inhibitors or stabilizers in in vivo models of viral infections. In vitro studies have suggested that inhibiting
HIF-1α could represent an effective anti-viral strategy, including against respiratory viruses such as respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our
preliminary data in a mouse model of RSV infection, the leading cause of severe acute lung illness in infants for
which there are no effective therapeutics or licensed vaccines, did not support this strategy, as we found that
inhibition of HIF-1α worsen clinical disease and favors viral replication, while stabilization of HIF proteins
improves clinical disease and lung function. The central hypothesis of this application is that during RSV infection
(and possibly other respiratory viruses) HIFs mediate activation and survival of key immune cells that control
antiviral responses while maintaining lung integrity and function. We will test this hypothesis in a well-established
mouse model of RSV infection. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the contributions of HIF-1α and/or HIF-2α to
RSV-mediated clinical disease, lung function, immune modulation, and viral replication using inhibitors specific
for each of the HIF-αsubunits. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that HIF stabilization protects the
airways from experimental RSV infection and modulate antiviral immune responses, using similar disease and
viral outcomes. This is a novel project with a long-term goal to uncover the unique and complex contribution of
HIFs to both antiviral immunity and lung pathophysiology, and with wider relevance for human respiratory
infections. This contribution is significant as these studies will provide important new information for ongoing
clinical trials of HIF inhibitors, used in patients with cancers and other diseases who could be at higher risk for
more severe respiratory viral infections, as well the potential use of HIF stabilizers as therapeutic approach for
respiratory virus associated lung diseases."

hygiene and sanitation and in temperate zones during warmer months. Infected children develop
severe malnutrition and show severe physical and cognitive growth. Control of these parasites
depends on the administration of anthelmintic drugs like benzimidazoles like albendazole,
macrocyclic lactone, ivermectin, and nicotinic agonists like levamisole and pyrantel. The
development of resistance to these anthelmintics poses a great challenge in controlling the
transmission of these diseases. Parasitic nematodes are complex organisms that adopt complex
mechanisms to resist exposure to anthelmintic drugs. We have identified tachyphylaxis as one
mechanism the parasite utilizes to resist and recover motility in the continued exposure to the
cholinergic anthelmintic levamisole. The endoplasmic reticulum retention protein, NRA-2, is one
of the proteins implicated in modulating tachyphylaxis in the female Brugia malayi parasites. The
transcription factor, DAF-12 is upregulated in tachyphylactic worms and could play a key role in
mediating tachyphylaxis. Macrocyclic lactone, abamectin, has limited effect on its own on the
motility of adult B. malayi but, when applied in combination with levamisole, prevents
tachyphylaxis and recovery of motility. Here, we propose,
Aim #1: To test the hypothesis that DAF-12 mediates tachyphylaxis in B. malayi. We will
knockdown daf-12 in adult B. malayi to determine its role in mediating tachyphylaxis. We will
measure transcript levels of nra-2 in daf-12 knockdown worms to determine the role of DAF-12 in
regulating the expression of nra-2. We will also target DAF-12 using agonists to prevent
tachyphylaxis.
Aim #2: To test the hypothesis that muscle calcium concentrations & calcium release
mechanisms produced by levamisole are changed in the presence of macrocyclic
lactones. We will investigate the effects of macrocyclic lactones, abamectin, ivermectin, and
moxidectin in prolonging the paralysis induced by levamisole. We will evaluate the change in
calcium release mechanisms due to macrocyclic lactones by performing RNAi of the ryanodine
and the IP3 receptors, unc-68 and itr-1 in B. malayi, and performing in vivo calcium imaging using
C. elegans.
At the end of these experiments, we will have characterized DAF-12 as a novel anthelmintic target
that could help prevent cholinergic tachyphylaxis. We would have an insight into the effect of
macrocyclic lactones on levamisole calcium release mechanisms in nematode muscle. These
studies will provide an improved mechanistic insight into cholinergic tachyphylaxis and a rational
avenue to prevent worm recovery and resistance."
10774249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African American (AA) women are disproportionately affected by triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly
heterogeneous and aggressive subtype of breast cancer. We found that AA patients with TNBC have a higher
risk of death from the disease than their European American (EA) counterparts, which is independent of their
sociodemographic and clinical factors. Notably, this TNBC disparity is more obvious in patients receiving
chemotherapy. However, the molecular mechanisms driving differential tumor response to chemotherapy and
the consequent prognostic disparities in AA vs. EA TNBCs remains unknown. Most chemotherapy agents exert
their cytotoxic effects through the induction of deadly DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are repaired by
two major mechanisms: error-free homologous recombination (HR) and error-prone non-homologous end-
joining (NHEJ). Genomic stability and survival of tumor cells upon genotoxic treatments are known to depend
on HR. Our pilot study showed that AA TNBCs tend to have higher expression of HR-related proteins and
lower expression of NHEJ-related proteins compared with EA TNBCs. The AAA+ ATPase VCP has been
suggested to influence the choice of DSB repair pathways in favor of HR as opposed to NHEJ. We recently
reported that Ser784 phosphorylation of VCP is required for DNA damage repair and intra-tumor pSer784-VCP
levels predict poor survival in TNBC patients, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. Our pilot data also
showed that both total VCP protein and DNA damage-induced pSer784-VCP levels are higher in AA vs. EA
TNBC samples. Based on these data, we hypothesize that AA TNBCs, relative to EA TNBCs, are intrinsically
more capable of repairing chemotherapy-induced DSBs by HR as opposed to NHEJ due to differential
expression levels and functionality of DSB repair factors including pSer784-VCP, which underlies their worse
clinical outcomes. We propose three specific aims. First, we will confirm racial differences in protein expression
of HR and NHEJ factors in tumor tissues obtained from two large cohorts of TNBC patients and examine their
contribution to survival disparities. Second, we will experimentally compare HR and NHEJ efficiencies between
AA and EA TNBC cell line and patient-derived mouse xenograft (PDX) models, and correlate the racial
differences in DSB repair pathway choice and genotoxic chemotherapy effects. Third, we will examine the
ability of pSer784-VCP to regulate DSB repair pathway choice and genotoxic chemotherapy effects in AA TNBC
models. The proposed study will greatly improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
racial disparities in TNBC treatment response and outcomes. The results will also help create new disparity
intervention strategies by establishing pSer784-VCP as a novel predictive biomarker and sensitizing target for
genotoxic chemotherapy treatments in AA TNBCs.

10774250,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable
recurrence. GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are
highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival,
treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem-
like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels
— and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence
of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely
unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in
the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect
distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is
that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical
and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues
present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue-
engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the
microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties
of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM. For some
experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which
GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and
providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond
differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related
events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to
microenvironmental cues. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying
responses to specific features of the microvessel niche. Collectively, the proposed studies will make significant
strides towards our understanding of how interactions of GBM with the microvessel niche promote tumor
recurrence by characterizing: 1) biomechanical properties of GBM tumors and microvessels (Aim 1), 2) migratory
response of GBM cells to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2) and 3) mechanisms governing
the migratory responses to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2). In the long term, we expect
these insights will lead to the development of new therapies targeting GBM recurrence.

10774252,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Nearly 1 in every 120 children born has a congenital heart defect (CHD).
While surgical therapy has improved survival, many of these children go on to develop heart failure (HF). The
emergence of cardiovascular regenerative medicine as a potential therapeutic strategy for pediatric HF has
provided new avenues for treatment. While primarily tried in adults, stem cell therapy is relatively untested in
the pediatric population. It is thus critical to develop novel methods of exploring the regenerative potential of
these cells to improve therapeutic interventions in the pediatric population. Stem cell based therapies have
shown beneficial effects on several cardiovascular diseases in adults, and cardiac-derived c-kit+ progenitor
cells (CPCs), a progenitor cell found in the myocardium, have met with early success in a clinical trial in adults.
Due to the ability to readily isolate these cells from CHD patients during surgery, their capacity to proliferate in
culture, and their ease of manipulation, pediatric CPCs serve as an ideal cell population for regenerative
medicine. However, previous studies have shown that unless these cells are extracted at a very young age (<1
month) the therapeutic efficacy of these cells is diminished. With the vast majority of patients undergoing
surgery for CHDs >1 month old, finding novel ways to enhance the regenerative potential of these cells would
overcome this critical barrier to stem cell therapy and allow for both autologous and allogeneic treatment
options in children and adults. It has been shown that the regenerative potential of adult CPCs can be
enhanced by ex vivo manipulation. Electrical stimulation (ES) is one treatment known to enhance cardiogenic
potential of various adult stem cells; however, the mechanism remains undetermined. Our published data show
that pediatric CPCs (isolated from patients between 1-5 years of age) respond to ES by initiating calcium
(Ca2+) oscillations making them an ideal population of cells for manipulation by ex vivo ES. Additionally, our
data indicate ES enhances both the function and the retention of pediatric CPCs in vivo. The objective of this
proposal is to examine the protective/regenerative capacity of pediatric CPCs in response to ES. We aim to
characterize the paracrine factors released by ES-treated pediatric CPCs and determine their effect on cardiac
cells, characterize the mechanism of enhanced adhesion/retention, and finally determine if ES enhances their
function in vivo. Successful completion of this project will provide mechanisms to enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of cardiac stem cells, provide autologous and allogeneic treatment options, and advance regenerative
medicine. This project also directly addresses a critical barrier in stem cell therapies for pediatric HF by
providing autologous and allogeneic treatments using pre-conditioned CPCs. Additionally, our preliminary data
suggest our findings may be applicable as a broader therapy for other cardiac indications such as myocardial
infarction. Our results will have implications on all cell-based therapies and offer valuable insights into
mechanisms to enhance the therapeutic potential of stem/progenitor cells from children to adults."

10777086,"Summary
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (RAS/MAPK) signaling pathway is an established driver of many cancers, commonly
hyperactivated by genetic alterations in RAS or BRAF. RAF and MEK inhibitors (RAFi and MEKi) have been
clinically successful in BRAF-mutant (BRAF-MUT) tumors, but their clinical efficacy in RAS-mutant (RAS-MUT)
tumors has been so far modest, limited by toxicities. Based on the experience with BRAF-MUT tumors, we posit
that clinical efficacy of RAS pathway-targeting inhibitors requires selective MAPK inhibition in RAS-MUT tumors
over RAS-WT normal cells. To achieve such RAS-MUT tumor-selective potency of RAS pathway inhibitors, we
need better understanding of how RAS activation affects target drug binding and MAPK inhibition in cells. The
goal of this proposal is to accomplish a better understanding of how the cellular context affects tumor-selective
therapeutic potency of RAFi and MEKi, with the goal of designing more effective therapeutic strategies for RAS-
MUT cancers. Our preliminary findings suggest that RAS activation differentially affects RAFi binding to RAF
paralogs, as well as their protein stability. We have further evidence that although RAFi suppress MAPK
preferentially in RAS-MUT over RAS-WT normal cells, combinations of RAFi and MEKi result in similar MAPK
inhibition in the two contexts, they are thus predicted to promote dose-limiting toxicities. Our hypothesis is that
RAS activation affects protein expression levels and conformations of RAF paralogs and MEK resulting in
differential binding to RAFi and MEKi, determining tumor-selective MAPK and cell growth inhibition by these
drugs. This hypothesis will be tested in three Aims: Aim 1 will characterize differential RAFi binding to RAF
paralogs in RAS-MUT and normal cells using in-cell binding assays and structural and biophysical approaches.
Aim 2 will define effects of RAS activation on RAF paralog protein stability and expression. Aim 3 will characterize
biochemically, biophysically and in vivo combinations of diverse RAFi and MEKi to determine whether the lack
of tumor-selective suppression of MAPK signaling in RAS-MUT tumor over RAS-WT normal cells increases
toxicity and limits the efficacy of combined RAFi+MEKi.
The proposed research will develop experimental tools and concepts to delineate mechanisms determining
differential potency of RAFi and MEKi in RAS-MUT over normal cellular contexts. Defining such mechanisms
should enable the rational design of more effective RAS pathway-targeting drugs and drug combinations for the
treatment of RAS-MUT cancers."
10809606,"Abstract
The re-emergence in maternal and congenital syphilis (CS) infection in recent years has brought
this sexually transmitted infection (STI) to the forefront of policy discussions among federal and
state health and human services departments. The recommended tests at birth demonstrate poor
sensitivity for the diagnosis of CS, necessitating longitudinal follow up for up to 18 months until
infection can be definitively excluded. This strategy inevitably results in cases of delayed or even
missed treatment, leading to serious adverse outcomes that could have been prevented. With data
suggesting a missed diagnosis rate approaching 15%, there is an urgent need for improved
diagnostic modalities to detect CS through direct identification ofT. pallidum using highly
sensitive contemporary nucleic acid amplification tests (NAA Ts). Two potential options include:
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the Aptima Treponema pallidum
transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay. By directly detecting the pathogen in
neonatal biospecimens, these assays may provide more timely detection of CS in order to initiate
timely evaluations and treatment. The aim of this study is to conduct a large, multicenter,
prospective observational cohort trial of 924 maternal and neonatal dyads at risk for CS to
effectively evaluate the test performance of these NAATs compared to the 2021 STD CS
infection categories assigned to that patient at birth ( confirmed proven/highly probable, possible
CS, CS less likely, CS unlikely) to determine if a superior diagnostic algorithm exists.
Longitudinal follow up confirming infection status will be performed up to 18 months of age.
Based on existing scientific premise, our central hypothesis is that the contemporary NAA Ts will
result in a more sensitive, specific and timely diagnosis of congenital infection with T. pallidum
compared to the standard recommended testing algorithms. In addition, we plan to leverage the
resulting clinical cohort to more accurately define adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes
associated with CS. This study will be the first to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes of
affected children by performing Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development™ at 18
months on the offspring of infected women. Beyond the importance of this research in terms of
pure science, the results could have far-reaching public health implications that may contribute to
improved quality and guideline efforts."
10777098,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method of noninvasive brain stimulation that is effective for
neuropsychiatric symptom targeting when administered in repeated daily sessions. While promising, the mixed
results from current RCTs on efficacy may be attributed to inadequate session numbers and marked individual
differences in treatment response. We propose to integrate biomarker guidance into tDCS technology to
individualize and optimize dosing for improving its clinical utility: (1) tDCS is a well-tolerated and exhaustively
characterized neuromodulation technique, effective in targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms, including
depression (Level of Evidence: definitely effective); (2) tDCS offers the advantage of home-based administration,
remotely controlled through a digital telehealth platform. However, without biomarker guidance, pivotal efficacy
trials may be premature. Our Approach is focused on translating these findings into a device.
 In Aim 1, we will verify the scientific feasibility of tDCS device integration with the nonspecific biomarker of
heart rate variability (HRV). By measuring a biomarker that corresponds with the treatment target, its change in
response to initial tDCS can indicate if and when an individual will respond. HRV is an emergent and easily
obtained biomarker of both tDCS target engagement and neuropsychiatric distress and responsiveness to tDCS.
CCNY discovered tDCS impedance-based HR-sensing, which could be integrated seamlessly into this telehealth
tDCS system. We will recruit n=100 adults with mild to moderate depression randomized 2:1 to receive 10
sessions of active or sham tDCS. We will verify impedance-based HR data capture (i-HR) in comparison to the
standard chest strap ECG, and measure HRV in response to tDCS and in correspondence with the expected
change in depression symptoms across the 10 sessions. (1A) tDCS i-HR tracks standard HR, (1B1) is a
biomarker of tDCS target engagement, and (1B2) tracks change in depression (MADRS) during the intervention.
 In Aim 2, data collected in Aim 1 will be used for the technical development of the integrated tDCS-HR
device. Aim 2 develops (1) robust signal processing (leveraging machine learning and FEM current-flow models)
for i-HR and (2) an integrated FDA-QS-compliant tDCS plus a sensing system.
Our team represents key areas of expertise: at-home tDCS, neuropsychiatric, biomedical engineering, and signal
processing. With the strength of our remotely supervised tDCS method, this work will result in a biomarker-
integrated tDCS telehealth platform, representing an innovative solution customizable to a wide range of
hypothesis-driven (targeted engaged) therapy discoveries. At-home treatments reduce disparity in healthcare
access, accelerate trial recruitment, and support scalability. Responsive to the NIH priority for the validation
of biomarkers “fit for purpose”, this collaboration “between the life and physical sciences” applies a
“multidisciplinary bioengineering approach” to “integrate, optimized, validate” and “accelerate the adoption” of
“promising solutions to clinical problems”."

Metal ions are required nutrients for cellular function, but can also be toxic if misregulated. Our immune system
leverages this dichotomy by deploying mechanisms both to withhold nutrient metals from pathogens as well as
overwhelm them with toxic levels, particularly of Cu and Zn. Metal imbalances at the cellular level have also
been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and are being investigated as possible anticancer strategies.
But what exactly are the targets and mechanisms of cellular metal stress? The research proposed here explores
this question of cellular metal stress by seeking to identify protein targets of aberrant metal interactions by
measuring global changes in protein stability across the proteome. The proposed work builds on preliminary and
recently published results from this collaborative team showing the utility of a pulse proteolysis mass
spectrometry method developed in co-PI Fitzgerald’s laboratory to identify protein targets of Cu in E. coli,
establishing these proteomic methodologies for the study of metal-protein interactions. The overall objective of
the current application is to identify proteins that are functionally affected when cells experience stress induced
by exposure to excess levels of Zn and Cu. This objective will be met by using a powerful combination of mass
spectrometry-based proteomic methods to address four specific aims: 1) Determine global profiles of protein
stability changes as a function of cellular metal overload and metal deficiency across bacterial, fungal, and
human cancer cells; 2) Establish a mechanistic basis linking differential stability of Aim 1 proteins to function; 3)
Identify the relative sensitivity of proteins across the proteome to misfolding induced by Cu and Zn binding; and
4) Establish a biophysical basis for understanding the relative sensitivity of proteins to metal-induced misfolding.
Understanding how protein stability is impacted across the proteome upon exposure to normal or aberrant levels
of Cu and Zn has important implications for understanding metal-induced toxicity and mechanisms cells use to
maintain metal homeostasis in the face of metal-associated stress. By studying proteomes from microbial, fungal,
and human cancer cells, the outcomes of these studies will advance our understanding of how these organisms
respond at the proteome level to changing metal environments imposed by the host immune system. These
studies will inform and impact the development of pharmacological agents against microbial pathogens and
cancer cells, and align with the applicant’s long-term goals to develop chemical tools to manipulate biological
metal ion location, speciation, and reactivity for potential therapeutic benefit."

10756444,"Project Summary: Over the past five years, the leading cause of death worldwide for children under five has
been complications from preterm birth (PTB) (<37 weeks’ gestation). In 2016, almost ten percent of all infants
born in the United States were delivered prematurely, and by 2018 the United States was reported to have the
most adverse outcomes during childbirth in the developed world. Collectively, PTB is estimated to cost 14 billion
dollars annually. Historically, PTB has been challenging to study as the underlying causes are poorly understood,
and there is a lack of physiologically relevant animal models. Progress in understanding the drivers of PTB has
been further stalled by limited access to human tissue for research purposes, as specimens from preterm
deliveries usually require pathological evaluation. Though elusive in mechanism, the placenta is an ideal target
for uncovering triggers of PTB as placental pathologies are observed in many cases. One such pathology is the
presence of inflammatory lesions. While inflammation is elevated during both healthy term and preterm labor,
the literature strongly suggests that differential inflammatory pathways are active in preterm deliveries, and
inflammation may overall be increased compared to term births. Our recently published work was the first to
document the contribution of immune cells within the placental villi (PV) to intraamniotic inflammation in non-
human primates and specifically uncovered that PV T cells are active and inflammatory in this model. In
agreement with these findings, our preliminary data show that T cells with memory phenotypes are present in
the PV in healthy pregnancy and can elicit inflammatory responses when stimulated with antigens from the
uterine environment. Furthermore, preliminary transcriptional data from our group revealed that T cells from
preterm PV transcribe more activation markers than term PV counterparts and correlatively preterm PV have
greater placental destruction indicated by apoptosis of trophoblast cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that failed
restriction of antigen presentation to PV T cells leads to PV T cell overactivation, increased cytokine
production, and subsequent destruction of placental architecture resulting in PTB. This proposal will use
multi-omic analysis coupled with in vitro functional assays on preterm and term placentas to uncover unique PV
T cells: populations, functional capacity, transcriptional machinery, and downstream responses on trophoblasts
in preterm birth. We propose: (1) Perform comparative functional analyses of PV T cells in preterm and
term pregnancies, including anatomic localization, activation state, and TCR repertoire profiles in Aim 1.
(2) Evaluate the consequences of PV T cell activation on placental trophoblast health and function in Aim
2. Our repository of cryopreserved PV samples and ongoing collection of new specimens, expertise in placental
biology and mucosal immunology, and a multidisciplinary team of scientists make us uniquely positioned to
accomplish these goals. At its completion, this study will increase our understanding of the function of T cells in
pregnancy and in other immunological tolerance settings."

most adverse outcomes during childbirth in the developed world. Collectively, PTB is estimated to cost 14 billion
dollars annually. Historically, PTB has been challenging to study as the underlying causes are poorly understood,
and there is a lack of physiologically relevant animal models. Progress in understanding the drivers of PTB has
been further stalled by limited access to human tissue for research purposes, as specimens from preterm
deliveries usually require pathological evaluation. Though elusive in mechanism, the placenta is an ideal target
for uncovering triggers of PTB as placental pathologies are observed in many cases. One such pathology is the
presence of inflammatory lesions. While inflammation is elevated during both healthy term and preterm labor,
the literature strongly suggests that differential inflammatory pathways are active in preterm deliveries, and
inflammation may overall be increased compared to term births. Our recently published work was the first to
document the contribution of immune cells within the placental villi (PV) to intraamniotic inflammation in non-
human primates and specifically uncovered that PV T cells are active and inflammatory in this model. In
agreement with these findings, our preliminary data show that T cells with memory phenotypes are present in
the PV in healthy pregnancy and can elicit inflammatory responses when stimulated with antigens from the
uterine environment. Furthermore, preliminary transcriptional data from our group revealed that T cells from
preterm PV transcribe more activation markers than term PV counterparts and correlatively preterm PV have
greater placental destruction indicated by apoptosis of trophoblast cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that failed
restriction of antigen presentation to PV T cells leads to PV T cell overactivation, increased cytokine
production, and subsequent destruction of placental architecture resulting in PTB. This proposal will use
multi-omic analysis coupled with in vitro functional assays on preterm and term placentas to uncover unique PV
T cells: populations, functional capacity, transcriptional machinery, and downstream responses on trophoblasts
in preterm birth. We propose: (1) Perform comparative functional analyses of PV T cells in preterm and
term pregnancies, including anatomic localization, activation state, and TCR repertoire profiles in Aim 1.
(2) Evaluate the consequences of PV T cell activation on placental trophoblast health and function in Aim
2. Our repository of cryopreserved PV samples and ongoing collection of new specimens, expertise in placental
biology and mucosal immunology, and a multidisciplinary team of scientists make us uniquely positioned to
accomplish these goals. At its completion, this study will increase our understanding of the function of T cells in
pregnancy and in other immunological tolerance settings."

As a board-certified veterinary radiation oncologist and radiobiologist, I am committed to, and excited for, a
career in translational cancer research as a physician scientist. My long-term career goal is to develop into an
independent veterinary clinician scientist, proficient in designing and performing innovative radiation research,
with a focused interest in tumor microenvironmental effects of radiation therapy and immunotherapy to improve
treatment outcomes for patients with head and neck cancer.
Head and neck cancer (HNC) is common in the United States and Europe and the prognosis is poor for patients
with advanced disease. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which allows delivery of high dose, high
precision radiation in a few fractions, is a novel therapy that can be used to treat HNC patients. Evidence exists
that SBRT is a more potent activator of anti-tumor immune responses compared to conventional radiotherapy.
Emerging preclinical and clinical data suggest SBRT combined with immunotherapy has the potential to convert
immunologically “cold” (immunosuppressed) tumors into “hot” (inflamed) tumors. SBRT and IO combinations can
stimulate effector T cell responses to each patient’s tumor. HNC patients with high risks for lymph node
metastasis typically receive RT targeted to their primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (RLN) in order to
eradicate latent metastatic tumor cells; however, RLNs are critical sites for generating immune responses, and
RLN irradiation is likely to destroy the immune cells responsible for anti-tumor responses.
Based on my preliminary data that SBRT caused depletion of T cell density and expansion of
immunosuppressive immune cell populations in RLNs compared to RLNs spared from RT, we propose to study
how RLN irradiation affects local and systemic anti-tumor immunity when combined with RT and IO. We will test
our hypotheses with orthotopic murine head and neck cancer models and in canine cancer patients who have
developed oral carcinoma. For the study, we will use the local tumor immunotherapy combination of agonistic
OX-40 monoclonal antibody + TLR9 ligand, which has demonstrated positive tumor microenvironmental immune
effects in mice and dogs.
If we demonstrate RT+IO and RLN sparing improves outcomes in translational preclinical models of advanced
HNC, the results of this project would challenge the current standard of care and clinical paradigm surrounding
radiation, immunotherapy, and elective RLN irradiation for patients with advanced HNC. Through the K01 career
development program, I will have the opportunity to delve deeper into radiation and immunology research and
grow as an independent translational scientist through the direct influence, support, and guidance of my strong
mentorship team, Dr. Steven Dow, Dr. Xiao-Jing Wang, and Dr. Sana Karam."
10799722,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development
of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams.
Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences
and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal,
coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss.
These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free
images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in
response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental
impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus.
The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in
deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We
propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop
practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging
without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality
and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost.
We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid,
automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the
scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved
with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively
update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between
subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and
selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1).
Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on
deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for
transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and
analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the
boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote
this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of
fetal neuroimaging sequences."
10783093,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For decades, the mouse has been the premier animal model for studies of human disease, providing
the opportunity to explore experimental questions that are intractable for direct study in humans. As a
result, key insights have been obtained for a variety of clinical conditions. Spurred by advances in
technology and international efforts to systematically knock out all of the protein coding genes in the
genome, the number of genetically engineered mice has expanded rapidly in the past 20 years. The
responsibility for maintenance and distribution of mutant mice was initially placed on individual
investigators, which was a tremendous burden in terms of cost, labor and space. In 1999, the NIH
recognized the need for a resource to protect the investment in mutant mouse strains and ensure open
access to all biomedical researchers and established the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers
(MMRRC). Since 1999, the central goal of the MMRRC-UNC has been to work collectively with
MMRRC consortium partners to develop and maintain high standards for importation, rederivation,
cryopreservation, and distribution of mutant mouse strains to biomedical investigators. The MMRRC-
UNC will continue to contribute to the goals of the Consortium in the next project period by
implementing the following Specific Aims devoted to continuing its successful role as a cryoarchive and
distribution center and incorporating research goals that synergize with and extend the value of the
resource: 1) Streamline and improve operating procedures to increase importation, distribution, and
cryoarchive of mouse strains. 2) Establish, maintain, and distribute a comprehensive cryoarchive for the
Collaborative Cross (CC) resource. 3) Develop and disseminate computational tools for mouse genetic
QC and genomics research, which will enhance phenotypic reproducibility. 4) Investigate the interaction
of genetics and environment on experimental variability and reproducibility.

10779841,"Abstract/Project Summary
Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies are characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) non-regenerative
axon damage and eventual cell death. Optic nerve crush (ONC), which transects all RGC axons, is often used
to model this process, and to seek interventions that preserve RGCs and promote regeneration of their axons.
Following ONC in mice, ~80% of the RGCs die within 2 weeks, and virtually none of the survivors regenerate
axons. We and others have used ONC to identify interventions that lead to increased survival, increased
regeneration or both. However, these treatments are only partially effective and many relevant targets are not
well-suited for the clinic. It is therefore important to identify additional and improved promoters of survival and
regeneration. Kinases are key regulators of cellular responses to insults and stresses. Furthermore, because
of their discrete enzymatic activity, kinases are druggable targets. Thus, we performed a preliminary in vivo
CRISPR-assisted kinase screen paired with ONC in adult mice to determine which kinases prevent RGC
survival and axon regeneration. To our excitement, the first round of screening through 750 kinases identified
17 anti-survival and 5 anti-regenerative hits. Many of these hits represent new mechanistic and translational
insights. In the proposed study, we will first examine the mechanistic underpinnings of two novel target kinase
pathways (namely LKB1/SNRK and Mkk4/Mkk7) that we have already verified the efficacy of with larger
experimental cohorts beyond our preliminary screen. These experiments will allow us to more completely
understand their mechanisms of action to formulate ideal therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we will
complete the validation of our remaining target kinases with full experimental cohorts in the ONC model.
Finally, we will choose the most promising gRNAs with robust neuroprotective effects and test their ability to
protect RGCs in our recently developed glaucoma model. At the completion of these studies, we expect to
be well-positioned to leverage the knowledge generated here into druggable targets to treat multiple
conditions causing blindness."

This research will break new ground in sensorimotor neuroscience by relating cortical and muscle activity data
to shape change in a soft-bodied organ, making it possible to evaluate the generalizability of basic principles of
motor control across musculoskeletal systems. It will develop and test a computational biomechanical model of
tongue function that relates muscle activity to tongue movements, complementing ongoing modeling studies of
human tongues based on more limited kinematic and muscle activity data. By using variation in natural feeding
behavior to elicit a range of hyolingual kinematics, the research will provide insight into the impact of dietary
modification—a treatment for dysphagia—on hyolingual kinematics. This research will lay the groundwork for
development of hyolingual neuroprostheses driven by cortical signals to facilitate chewing and swallowing after
(e.g., cancer) surgery or degenerative diseases, and for better techniques for non-invasive brain stimulation,
muscle stimulation, and rehabilitation exercises used in treatment of, e.g., dysphagia and dysarthria."

Fibromyalgia (FM) is the quintessential nociplastic pain condition and is characterized by chronic widespread
pain, mood and sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction, and affects >20 million Americans.
Underserved individuals feel these impacts more profoundly as symptom burden is heavily influenced by social
determinants of health (SDOH). As pharmacological treatments offer only small benefits and numerous
adverse effects, guidelines suggest non-pharmacological treatments for FM such as physical therapy/exercise
and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), although individuals with high SDOH risk have the least access and
ability to consistently engage in these therapies. A need exists to develop adjunctive approaches to manage
FM symptoms that have optimal treatment effects, minimal side effects, and are easy to implement and readily
accessible for all. Morning bright light treatment can reduce depression, improve sleep, and advance circadian
timing (more “morningness”), all of which may reduce FM pain. Morning bright light treatment is also non-
invasive and self-administered with minimal side effects, making it a potentially accessible and scalable non-
pharmacological treatment for FM. We tested a 4-week, 1-hour daily morning bright light versus dimmed light
(comparison) treatment in individuals with FM (R21 NR016930), using a commercially available wearable light
device. We found the morning light treatment was feasible, reliably advanced and stabilized sleep timing, and
significantly improved function, pain, depression, and sleep quality, all with minimal side effects. The
improvement in function was similar to that seen after exercise, and double that seen after CBT. However,
more research is needed to confirm applicability across diverse sociodemographic groups and identify the
separate contribution of sleep timing stabilization and morning bright light. A sociodemographically diverse
sample of individuals with FM (n=390) will be randomized to one of three groups: (1) 4 weeks of morning bright
light treatment (1 h/day with sleep timing stabilization), (2) 4 weeks of sleep timing stabilization without light
treatment, or (3) treatment as usual (TAU), with equivalent study contact (n=103 completed in each group).
The study will be conducted remotely with virtual assessments pre- and post-treatment and at 3 month follow
up. As per others and our own research, a SDOH risk index will be derived from individual and community level
resources. Aim 1 is to compare function and pain outcomes across the three groups of morning bright light,
sleep timing stabilization alone, or TAU. Aim 2 is to determine the effect of SDOH risk on baseline symptoms,
treatment adherence (engagement) and treatment response. Aim 3 is to explore if improvements in function
and pain are partially mediated by improvements in depression, sleep quality and a shift to morningness.
Results will reveal the active elements of morning bright light treatment for FM, the impact of SDOH on
symptom burden and treatment, and explore mechanisms of action. This research is the important next step in
the development of morning bright light treatment as an accessible treatment for chronic nociplastic pain."

Vaccination is a potent regulator of the immune system and much research is being conducted to understand
how antigen-specific stimulation can be used to induce and redirect anti-tumor immunity. Our team develops a
cancer immunotherapy program using novel AAV vectors to deliver antigens both directly and by cross-
presentation to antigen presenting cells. Optimization of naturally occurring AAV serotypes and novel methods
of AAV production are necessary to warrant wide use of these vectors for cancer immunotherapy. The main aims
of this proposal is to determine the safety and efficacy of our novel AAV-based vaccines as part of preclinical
studies by using companion dogs with oral melanoma.
In recent years, we have undertaken studies to gain a better understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms of AAV and host immune system interaction via the high efficiency transduction of DCs. We have
made the following scientific achievements, which form the basis of the current proposal:
• Identified and mutagenized critical surface-exposed serine and threonine residues on the AAV capsid that
 are involved in intracellular trafficking of virus in the host cells.
• Demonstrated that rational modifications in the AAV expression cassette results in antigen processing by
 dendritic cells (DCs), leading to a stronger and prolonged antigen-specific immune response.
• Developed the next generation of highly efficient AAV-vectors that expressed a tumor-associated antigens
 (premelanosome protein gp100 (also known as Pmel), tyrosinase (Tyr), tyrosinase-related protein 1(TRP1),
 and dopachrome tautomerase (TRP2).
• Tested these novel AAV vectors for their ability to stimulate a specific T-cell clone proliferation and protective
 immune response in a small animal model.
In this proposal, we will test ability of our recently developed optimized AAV capsid and expression cassette,
whose unique properties enhance a cellular/humoral immune response toward vector encoded tumor antigens.
Successful completion of the current proposal will result in:
 • Production of high titers of a therapeutic AAV-based vaccine.
• Identification of an optimal AAV-based dose for vaccination that can be used to slow/eliminate the
 progression of melanoma cancer in a large animal model such as companion dog-patients with spontaneous
cancer.
 • Mechanism of the novel cancer vaccine function in the most appropriate animal model.
 The optimized AAV vector can be potentially used as a vaccine platform for the treatment of cancers in
 canine and humans."

This proposal tests the fundamental hypothesis that daily rhythms in neuronal activity promote
growth of brain cancers and provide a temporal therapeutic window during which the efficacy of
treatments may be substantially optimized, and novel targets discovered. Timed delivery of
chemotherapy, or chronotherapy, has an established role in colorectal cancer and leukemia but
has never been evaluated in brain tumors. Here we build on exciting preliminary data in which we
have demonstrated that the efficacy of Temozolomide (TMZ), an established chemotherapeutic
for glioblastoma (GBM), is substantially modulated by the time of day when it is administered.
These findings suggest that we may already have the means of significantly improving outcome
from this dismal disease. In this proposal, we will utilize novel intracranial xenograft models of
GBM in which tumor cells have been engineered to serve as reporters of tumor circadian time
with and without intrinsic clock function, and in which recipient mice have been genetically
engineered to allow control of diurnal cycles in neuronal activity, hormone signaling or rest-wake
behavior. We will test in mice how human and mouse GBM cells integrate into the host’s circadian
system to drive proliferation. We will evaluate treatments targeting the tumor or host circadian
systems for their ability to slow tumor progression. Results from these experiments should reveal
a role for sex differences in circadian rhythms that affect tumor growth. Success in these studies
will advance our basic understanding of GBM biology and will provide critical information for the
translational application of chronotherapy to GBM care."

T
he National Institute on Drug Abuse's Division of Therapeutics and Medical
Consequences has identified a number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulated by functionally
distinct ligands as key targets for developing novel therapeutics to treat opioid overdose and opioid use disorders.
Identifying specific and selective small-molecule ligands for these receptors is crucial for understanding their
function and developing effective treatments. However, this is a challenging task due to the functional complexity
of GPCRs and the difficulty in customizing ligands for them, despite advances in GPCR functional and structural
biology. With the increasing availability of functional data from sophisticated bioactivity assays, billion-scale
electronic chemical libraries, and ever-growing high-resolution structural information on GPCRs, it is important
to develop quantitative and analytical approaches to leverage knowledge and information towards the
development of effective medications for OUDs. The proposed research aims to develop Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-driven strategies to design customized GPCR ligands and efficiently screen ultra-large electronic chemical
libraries to speed up the discovery of novel chemical compounds with distinct pharmacological profiles targeting
GPCRs linked to drug abuse. Specifically, the study will investigate the performance of deep neural network
classifiers trained on large datasets of key structural and physicochemical properties of ligands and targets from
receptor subfamilies and compare it with the performance of classifiers trained on features from a single GPCR
of those subfamilies in distinguishing between ligands with varying efficacy at that receptor. The goal is to create
a scalable platform that can add value to current rational drug design approaches for GPCRs associated with
drugs of abuse by identifying lead compounds that can be developed into successful drugs for clinical

The maternal mortality rate in the United States (US) is the highest among high-income countries and has
been steadily rising in recent years. Near misses for maternal mortality, including both physical health
indicators captured by severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and mental health near misses such as suicidality and
overdose (hereafter, SMM+), are also increasing among birthing individuals. Racial and other disparities in
maternal mortality and SMM+ are widening. Telehealth utilization increased dramatically in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and has great potential to reduce SMM+ and SMM+ disparities through increasing
healthcare access and utilization, patient experience, and quality of care. However, there is little data on
maternal safety outcomes like SMM+, whether telehealth could reduce or exacerbate disparities in SMM+, and
how telehealth can be optimized with the goal of reducing SMM+ and SMM+ disparities. This project will
determine the impact of telehealth on SMM+ and SMM+ disparities and develop multidisciplinary clinical and
community consensus guidelines for how telehealth can be implemented to address equity issues and reduce
disparities in SMM+. We will apply a mixed-methods approach, conducting novel causal inference analyses of
a national Medicaid claims database, the largest US health insurance provider during pregnancy (>40% of
births; 65% of births to Black individuals), and qualitative work centered in Philadelphia, a city with a high
maternal mortality rate and one of the country's only local maternal mortality review committees. We will form a
community advisory board (CAB) that includes multidisciplinary stakeholders and lived experience experts to
provide substantial input on all aspects of the proposal. Specifically, we will estimate effects of hybrid
telehealth versus in-person only prenatal and postpartum care strategies and state policies expanding
coverage for telehealth modalities on SMM+ and SMM+ disparities using a novel trial emulation framework
(Aim 1); identify barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth care with the goal of reducing SMM+ and
SMM+ disparities (Aim 2); and develop and disseminate best practice recommendations for using telehealth to
detect early warning signs of SMM+ (Aim 3). Successful completion of this work will fill critical gaps in
knowledge about the safety, effectiveness and equitableness of maternity telehealth care and how telehealth
can be leveraged to reduce maternal health disparities. Through sustained partnership with a CAB and
dissemination of best practice recommendations, our methodologically innovative project will inform care,
guidelines, and policy in Philadelphia and nationally. By sharing our project's key findings, methods and
software code, we will generate a community-driven research agenda and cultivate collaborators for future
research using our database and CAB."

 Microsporidia are unicellular, ​fungal​ parasites with a wide host-range, from insects to humans. ​They are
emerging pathogens, classified as NIAID Category B opportunistic pathogens, and cause microsporidiosis in
immunocompromised patients.​ To gain entry into a target cell, microsporidia employ a remarkably unique and
specialized harpoon-like invasion machinery called the polar tube, which is conserved among microsporidial
species. While initially coiled neatly within the spore of the parasite, infection of a new cell begins with the rapid
extrusion of the polar tube from the spore on a fast timescale (< 2s), which anchors the spore to the host cell.
After it has been fired, the polar tube is thought to act as a conduit for the transfer of the infectious
“sporoplasm” into the target cell, where replication can begin. Early work has yielded global insights into this
process, and the molecular and structural underpinnings of the invasion process are ripe for exploration with
modern techniques, such as cryo electron microscopy. This work aims to address fundamental questions and
paradoxes in our understanding of the microsporidial polar tube machinery and how it drives invasion into host
cells. We will use a combined bottom-up (structural biology, biochemistry and other ​in vitro​ techniques on
purified proteins) and top-down (​in vivo​ light microscopy, electron tomography) approach; the intersection of
these approaches will allow us to unravel the mechanistic biology of this unique invasion process. ​Here we
focus on three human pathogens: ​Anncaliia algerae, Encephalitozoon cuniculi​ and ​Encephalitozoon hellem​.
 The specific aims are 1) To characterize the dynamics of polar tube firing and movement of sporoplasm
through the tube using high-speed optical microscopy, and to comprehensively define the composition of the
polar tube​ using mass spectrometry; 2) To biochemically and structurally characterize the individual protein
components of the polar tube organelle using X-ray crystallography, single particle cryo electron microscopy
and protein-protein interaction assays; 3) To elucidate the overall architecture and packing of the polar tube in
the spore using structural cell biology techniques such as serial block face scanning electron microscopy
(SBFSEM) and cryo focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryo FIB-SEM) followed by cryo electron
tomography (cryo ET)."

The paradox of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is that healthy older adults are often under-screened and
those in poor health are over-screened. One study found that 51% of US adults >75 years with < 10 years of
life expectancy were screened while 62% with >10 year LE were not. Guidelines recommend that adults >75
years make individualized decisions based on expectations of benefits, harms, values, and preferences. There
is a gap in existing decision aids (DAs) designed for low health literate (LHL) adults >75 years to assist in
making CRC screening decisions. This is concerning since risk factors (>75 years, low socioeconomic status,
low educational levels, racial/ethnic minority status) for LHL are associated with low CRC knowledge of
screening options, low self-efficacy, an apparent lack of desire to participate in SDM, and with less than
optimal screening. The primary objective for this K23 application is to optimize CRC screening decisions and
improve the quality of care among LHL adults 76-85 years with attention to differences by sex. The specific
aims are to: 1. Identify the information needs and perceptions of LHL older adults about CRC screening; 2.

We study the molecular mechanisms and signaling, from environmental input to physiological
output, that control bacterial biofilm formation, a key bacterial lifestyle linked to host-microbe
interactions and infectious disease. In particular, the capability of bacteria to sense and respond
to various microenvironments, particularly during the transition from a free-swimming to a
sessile biofilm lifestyle, contributes to the establishment of chronic infections. The underlying
mechanisms are equally important for non-pathogenic bacteria that can live in commensal
relationship with their host(s). Understanding the architecture and regulation of signaling
systems that control bacterial cell adhesion and biofilm formation is critical in the development
of novel therapies and preventative interventions, while providing fundamental insight into
bacterial signaling processes. Here, we propose mechanistic studies on a broadly conserved
cell adhesion system that is crucial for biofilm formation in a variety of pathogenic and
commensal organisms. We will focus on fundamental unanswered questions concerning how
cyclic-di-GMP networks control localization of these adhesins as well as how two such adhesins
contribute to formation of biofilms. We will also enhance the impact of our studies by
investigating a newly identified, analogous signaling system in an important commensal sulfate-
reducing bacterium. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cyclic-di-GMP signaling
via a network of ligand-responsive DGCs regulates biofilm formation across a number of
microbes of importance in pathogenic, host-associated, and environmental contexts. We
propose the following Specific Aims to test this hypothesis:
 AIM 1. Test the hypothesis that small-molecule ligands are critical for regulating the localized
 cdG network via receptor complexes in P. fluorescens.
 AIM 2. Test the hypothesis that discrete domain structures of LapA and MapA in Pfl contribute
 to their differential impacts on biofilm formation.
 AIM 3. Test the hypothesis that the sulfate-reducing bacterium LapD/LapG-like system
 controls localization of this intestinal bacterium’s LapA homolog."
10776454,"Powassan virus (POWV) is a neurovirulent tick-borne flavivirus (FV) emerging in the N.E. US. POWV is
present in tick saliva, injected into the skin during a 15-minute tick bite and causes a 10% fatal encephalitis
resulting in severe long-term neurologic damage in 50% of patients. The incidence of POWV encephalitis in
the elderly remains an enigma with mechanisms of POWV neuroinvasion, CNS cell targeting and
neuroinflammatory pathology, virtually unknown. To reflect POWV spread from skin to the CNS, POWV (LI9)
was isolated from deer ticks directly in epithelial cells. Mice s.c. inoculated with POWV LI9 develop lethal
neurovirulent disease with overt murine brain damage. Noting lethality in older mice, neurovirulence was
assessed as a function of age and found LI9 to be lethal in 90% of 50 wk, and <10% of 10 wk, old C57/Bl6
mice, and consistent with POWV neurovirulence in the elderly. Brains of 50 wk old mice had dramatically
increased viremia, chemokines, immune cell infiltrates and histopathology. LI9 was passage attenuated in IFN
deficient VeroE6 cells and the resulting virus, LI9-P, fails to cause murine disease and protects mice from LI9
challenge. This POWV pair provides a means of defining neurovirulence mechanisms.
 Mechanisms of POWV entry into the CNS remain to be revealed but are likely to be via hematogenous
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or blood-CSF-barrier (BCSFB) portals. BBB and BCSFBs are distinct and
respectively formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and choroid plexus epithelial cells
(CPEpCs). CPEpCs are uniquely responsive to IFNλ, and the BCSFB is the main immune cell gateway into the
CNS. In aged mice upregulated inflammatory IL-1β and IL1R responses are found in choroid plexus cells and
suggest potential mechanisms of age-dependent neuroinflammation.
 POWV LI9 infects CPEPCs and BMECs and regulates IFN responses in vitro. In mice LI9 directed CNS
viremia was dramatically inhibited by post-infection IFNλ treatment. In contrast to LI9, LI9-P highly induces
IFNβ/λ in infected CPEpCs, and failure to regulate IFN responses may explain LI9-P attenuation in mice. These
findings rationalize POWV entry into the CNS via BBB or BCSFB portals, and IFNλ as a key regulator of LI9
neuroinvasion and pathogenesis.
 To define mechanisms of LI9 neurovirulence and LI9-P attenuation a recombinant approach for generating
infectious POWVs and chimeras of LI9 and LI9-P was developed. Studies proposed use single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq), model BBB and BCSFBs and brain slice culture to define CNS cells targeted by
POWVs and mechanisms of LI9 neuroinvasion. Proposed studies analyze cell responses that permit POWV
neuroinvasion and define age-dependent neurovirulence mechanisms using neurovirulent LI9, attenuated LI9-
P and POWV mutants. Findings are likely to reveal responses that direct or restrict CNS damage, and targets
for preventing POWV neurovirulence that may be broadly applicable to other neurovirulent viruses."
10782495,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cities account for a large proportion of the global population of people living with HIV. As a result, Cities have
become the focus of UNAIDS's “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic through targeted scale-up
of prevention and testing services. In the United States, HIV surveillance data indicates a shifting composition
of the population of people newly infected with HIV, with females and minority populations accounting for
disproportionate rates of infection. These emerging health disparities in HIV incidence suggest that the largely
successful “Getting to Zero” public health initiatives (e.g. rapid expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP],
needle exchange and safe injecting sites, etc.) are not reaching the most vulnerable populations.
Leveraging routinely collected surveillance data paired with primary data collection, the major goal of this
research is to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection in Fast Track cities, using San Francisco as a test
case. This proposal seeks to provide multidisciplinary methodological and theoretical training to investigate the
scientific knowledge gap of ongoing HIV transmission in the era of “Getting to Zero.” The proposed training
areas are: (1) semi-parametric statistical modeling and machine learning in order to improve the accuracy and
precision of population size estimation methods; (2) molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic techniques to
assess the relatedness of HIV viral sequences between individuals, inferring a shared source of infection; and
(3) minority stress theory to measure the (socio-structural) characteristics of the environment and relate these
structural exposures to disparities in HIV infection. Aligned with the training components, the research goals of
this study are to: (a) estimate how many people are living with HIV in San Francisco and quantify the
magnitude of disparities in infection rates and access to health care services; (b) identify the sociodemographic
correlates of membership to a transmission cluster; and (c) identify the socio-structural facilitators of recent HIV
infections, particularly among minority populations, using a case-control study design. The evidence generated
from this work could have a direct impact on San Francisco's Getting to Zero campaign and inform novel
intervention targets for other Fast Track cities. Additionally, the exceptional methodological and practical
experience gained from this project will position the candidate for an impactful career as an independent
researcher."

Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in early childhood has profound implications on future health
risks into adulthood. Family-based strategies have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing chronic health risk
among children, yet few family-based interventions have specifically targeted healthy beverage consumption.
This study advances a long-term goal of developing scalable, multi-level interventions to promote
intergenerational health among indigenous families. Using community-based participatory methods and an
indigenous conceptual framework – the Navajo Wellness Model – we will conduct a cluster randomized trial to
study the effectiveness of Water is K’é, an innovative multi-level intervention designed to promote healthy
beverage consumption through strengthened connections with Navajo culture, health information and access
to reliable drinking water. Early child education sites will be randomly assigned to immediate or delayed
intervention. Children enrolled in the programs, their primary caregiver and other family members will be
enrolled and followed for 12 months to assess beverage consumption, health outcomes, as well as family
cohesion and cultural continuity. Using a mixed methods design, we will explore how intergenerational family
dynamics influence the way in which Water is K’é shapes family health and wellbeing. Finally, we will build
greater research capacity in among Navajo partners through Community Advisory Group guidance and
leadership, as well as mentorship of tribal college students interested in community research."

Single-cell immune profiling technologies, such as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) enable broad and
comprehensive characterization of diverse immune cell-types. Moreover, such technologies are being
increasingly applied in clinical settings to gain a holistic view of the immune system. Ex vivo stimulation is a
common perturbation applied to immune cells and assayed through CyTOF, which elicits functional responses
that may be clinically predictive. Such experiments generate single-cell measurements for a large number of
cells, causing manual analysis to become time-consuming and biased towards studying immune cell-types
and their functional responses that have already been well-characterized. Existing bioinformatics approaches
for automating manual analysis are limited in that they 1) primarily focus only on partitioning cells into cohesive
cell-populations, 2) need to be run independently per stimulation and 3) produce several immunological
features encoding cell-type specific functional responses to stimulation that are not indicative of canonical
immune signaling pathways. In this proposal, we introduce a fully automated approach for automating the
analysis of multi-sample, multi-stimulation immune profiling data. In particular, we shall develop algorithms to
efficiently identify clinically-predictive functional responses to stimulation in a scalable manner to enable
analysis of large clinical cohorts under several stimulation conditions. Uncovered functional responses that are
clinically predictive can be used to develop diagnostic tests or to design vaccines to elicit particular cellular
responses."
10776941,"Project Summary
 The 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) is 11%.
This poor outcome is due to multiple factors, including rapid progression to metastatic disease, poor clinical
responses to standard of care therapies, and no effective targeted or immunotherapeutic approaches1. The
treatment refractory nature of PDAC is likely due in part to the profoundly fibrotic and immune suppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) that is a hallmark of this disease. Two major drivers of this TME include a dense fibrotic
tumor stroma and a robust infiltration of tumor-supportive myeloid cells.
 PDAC contains phenotypically diverse cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subsets. These subsets include
myofibroblasts (myCAF), inflammatory fibroblasts and a small subset of antigen presenting CAFs. Recently, it
has been proposed by some investigators that myCAFs may have tumor restraining properties, while other
investigators have found myCAFs can promote tumor progression and treatment resistance. What is clear is that
tumor restraining or tumor promoting features are likely phenotype and context dependent. We propose herein
that cellular senescence may be distinguished by the tumor-promoting and restraining CAF subsets.
 Our overall hypothesis that: Stromal senescence plays a key role in driving tumor progression by altering
tumor immune and ECM properties. To address this hypothesis, we will use state of the art biophysical and
immunological techniques in human PDAC specimens, and state of the art genetically engineered mouse models
for both PDAC and the study of senescent cells, to evaluate the following aims.
Aim 1. Determine how biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix regulate the induction and function of
senescent CAFs.
Aim 2. Determine the impact of senescent CAFs on myeloid and dendritic cell driven immune surveillance.
Aim 3. Determine the organ specific impact of senescent CAFs on metastatic progression.
Significance: Understanding how the PDAC TME's regulate tumor immunity is critical to employing stromal
modulatory therapy to enhance immunotherapeutics. This concept is central to these studies."
10931450,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a rapidly escalating public health crisis with recent evidence suggesting that close
to 70% of drug overdoses involved opioids in the last year. Although many individuals seek treatment for OUD
over half return to use despite being maintained on a medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), underscoring
the critical need to identify factors that are associated with OUD reoccurrence. Chronic opioid use has been
linked to disturbances in sleep continuity and architecture, increased risk of sleep disordered breathing (SDB),
and abnormalities in proxy measures of circadian rhythms. However, less is known about the longitudinal
association of sleep/circadian phenotypes with non-medical opioid use among individuals in OUD treatment, and
malleable pathways that may account for these associations. Such knowledge is critical to informing translational
research and the development of novel interventions aimed at improving sleep, circadian rhythms, and OUD
outcomes. The proposed observational, longitudinal study will capitalize on existing collaborations with
community-based providers to determine the association of sleep duration, sleep architecture, SDB, and proxy
measures of circadian rhythms with illicit opioid use during treatment, and potential pathways (e.g., positive and
negative affect) that may influence these relationships. Participants (N = 130) will be enrolled in buprenorphine
or methadone treatment and complete a 6-month longitudinal study wherein they will complete overnight, in-lab
polysomnography (PSG) sessions three times to assess changes over time in sleep metrics (e.g., total sleep
time, sleep architecture, SDB). Before and after PSG sessions, we will collect saliva samples from participants
to determine diurnal cortisol patterns. Participants will also be fitted with a wrist-worn actigraphy device to further
quantify sleep and circadian rest activity rhythms. At baseline and during the final week of each month of
treatment, participants will complete a week-long “data burst” that includes ecological momentary assessments
of affect, craving, and stress. Participants will complete urine toxicology screens and self-report on their drug
use at the end of each data burst. Specific aims of the study are to (Aim 1) determine the bi-directional
association of circadian RARs and diurnal cortisol patterns with non-medical opioid use, (Aim 2) investigate
whether sleep duration and architecture over the course of treatment are associated with non-medical opioid
use, and (Aim 3) examine (a) associations of MOUD use with SDB, and (b) whether SDB is associated with low
positive affect and high negative affect. We will also explore whether clinically significant sleep and circadian
rhythm phenotypes are associated with low positive affect, high negative affect, and non-medical opioid use, and
whether affective processes mediate the association of sleep/circadian rhythm phenotypes and opioid use.
Findings from this project will enhance our understanding of specific sleep and circadian rhythms parameters
implicated in OUD, and the relationships among sleep phenotypes, affective processes, and non-medical opioid
use. This highly rigorous study will shed light on clinically relevant endpoints for future intervention trials."

New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM-HSC) requests support for predoctoral trainees within the umbrella
Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BSGP). The BSGP provides a broad base of academic coursework
followed by in-depth training in a chosen discipline with a research mentor. The goal of this IMSD program is
supplement with additional training activities in writing and speaking, a strong cohort peer-mentoring program
and additional institutional support programs. The program aims to increase the number of PhD graduates from
underrepresented groups entering the Biomedical workforce through enhanced recruitment, retention and
career development programs.
Our location in a majority-minority state along with a history of training students from underrepresented minority
(URM) groups, first generation college students and students from rural and low socioeconomic backgrounds will
assist recruitment of IMSD-targeted trainees. A long record of successfully recruiting and training students
from these groups is shown in the BSGP student population where more than one-third of current PhD students
are from URM backgrounds. Additionally, the IMSD leadership has developed relationships with regional
institutions with large populations of undergraduate students from underrepresented populations that we will
utilize to further increase recruitment of IMSD-targeted groups.
A proposed system of Learning Communities will provide faculty and peer mentoring in a culturally supportive
environment to assist retention and student success. Each Learning Community includes a faculty mentor from
an URM group along with IMSD students from each academic class to provide a safe place to discuss
challenges and celebrate successes with peers. Students are introduced to Learning Communities at a four-
week summer program that orients students to the UNM-HSC campus, provides an opportunity to begin their
first research rotation and uses cohort building exercises and training workshops to integrate new students into
the UNM community and to individual Learning Communities.
After summer orientation, students have two semesters of core coursework before choosing a research mentor
to oversee their dissertation research. All research mentors must complete rigorous training and will be reviewed
annually. Career development programs will expose students to non-academic careers in biomedical sciences
including a seminar series in Non-Academic Careers, networking exercises and options to get a transcripted
certificate in University Science Teaching and a concentration in Science and Technology Management.
More than fifty productive and collaborative faculty members from basic science and clinical departments are
available to serve as faculty research mentors while Learning Community mentors and education specialists
will provide non-research mentoring. Students will be selected during the admissions process as outlined in
our trainee selection plan for a three-year appointment with post-IMSD support provided by individual
fellowships or mentor-provided funding. Evaluation of the IMSD will be done in consultation with the Office of
Program Evaluation, Education, and Research Office within the UNM-HSC who are experts in evaluation of
education efficacy of students in biomedical fields. All program alumni will be tracked by the BSGP office with
annual updates on de-identified trainee outcomes published on our website and disseminated in workshops and
published reports presented by our education specialists at GREAT, SACNAS or other education meetings.

10774220,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Chlamydia genital infections are the most commonly reported infection in the U.S. All
Chlamydia species cause an unusual intracellular infection in which there is conversion
between a dividing form of the bacterium (reticulate body or RB) and the infectious form
(elementary body or EB). RB-to-EB conversion is critical for producing infectious
progeny that can spread the infection to a new host cell, but the mechanisms that
regulate it are unknown. There has been a longstanding assumption in the Chlamydia
field that conversion is regulated by an extrinsic factor. However, we have obtained data
to support a new regulatory mechanism in which RB size is used as an intrinsic factor to
control conversion. Based on temporal measurements of chlamydial size and number
obtained with three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D EM), we hypothesize that RBs
undergo size reduction through successive rounds of replication and can only convert
into an EB below a size threshold. In Aim 1, we will test this size control mechanism by
determining whether RB size is altered when the timing of RB-to-EB conversion onset is
changed. In Aim 2, we will investigate if the size of the first RB plays a role in starting
the timer of RB size reduction that eventually culminates in RB-to-EB conversion. In Aim
3, we will study how RB size could be used to regulate conversion. We propose a
titration mechanism in which EUO, a repressor of late chlamydial genes, is titrated away
in smaller RBs to promote conversion. In Aim 4, we will study alternative mechanisms
that utilize extrinsic signals to control conversion. Using mathematical modeling and 3D
EM analysis, we will test a contact-dependent mechanism, which is based on contact of
the RB with the inclusion membrane as the external signal, and a chlamydial
communication mechanism in which the external signal is produced by other
chlamydiae. These studies will provide important information about the mechanism of
RB-to-EB conversion that can be applied in new therapeutic strategies to block the
developmental cycle and the production of infectious progeny."

Fibrosis is the common endpoint responsible for liver failure in nearly every form of chronic liver disease, yet
there remains no effective treatment for preventing the progression of fibrosis. Our preclinical studies identified
a novel antifibrotic target, the enzyme acid ceramidase (aCDase). We demonstrated that depletion or inhibition
of aCDase reduces HSC activation, the key step in hepatic fibrogenesis. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of
aCDase or genetic knockout of aCDase in HSCs reduces fibrosis in mouse models for liver fibrosis as well as in
precision cut liver slices from fibrotic rats and humans. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a potent
inhibitor of aCDase for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. Using structure-based drug design, we have recently
discovered a novel series of covalent inhibitors with increased potency and metabolic stability. The objective of
this application is to optimize this lead series towards the goal of oral, once-daily dosing for the treatment of
hepatic fibrosis. In Aim 1, we will use structure-informed medicinal chemistry approaches to identify a covalent
inhibitor based on the lead series with optimal potency, ADME profile, selectivity, and PK properties for oral
delivery. In Aim 2, we will use mouse and human models of fibrogenesis to demonstrate the efficacy of the
optimized compounds. We have assembled a team with expertise in hepatic fibrosis, medicinal chemistry, and
antifibrotic drug development. This work is the first to target the aCDase pathway for the treatment of hepatic
fibrogenesis. Our expected outcome is identification of a candidate compound that is ready for nomination for
IND-enabling studies. This work is highly significant because it will facilitate a new treatment strategy for patients
with hepatic fibrosis, for which no therapies currently exist."

 This proposal seeks to investigate sex hormone effects on reward and aversion-related behaviors through
mapping of Lateral Habenula (LHb) circuits. The LHb is a central hub important for encoding aversive information
and coordinating motivated behaviors, actions critical for survival. Dysfunction in LHb-dependent circuits
contribute to a diverse set of disordered behaviors, such as aberrant processing of positive and negative valence,
anhedonia, depressive symptomology, and maladaptive stress response, to name a few. While it is known that
motivated behaviors are modulated by circulating sex hormones, no studies have investigated whether negative
circuit regulators, specifically projections from the LHb, contribute to this phenomenon. Furthermore, nuclear
hormone receptors in the brain have not been well characterized, therefore understanding their role within LHb
reward circuits and how they interact with circulating hormones will provide insight into mechanisms driving sex
hormone effects on reward-related behaviors. In this proposal, by taking advantage of the most recent
technologies to define, manipulate, and monitor neural activity, I plan to test the functional contribution of specific
hormone receptors on molecularly defined LHb projection neurons on reward and aversion-related behaviors."

supporting resources located on the OUHSC campus to build a new and unique research resource platform to 
train and support the RPLs and pilot awardees of this COBRE to conduct joint translational cancer research 
projects on two OU campuses. The overall operation of the CIDRC will include to: (1) ensure that RPLs fully 
understand all NIH policies and regulations for protection of human subjects and welfare of vertebrate animals, 
(2) certify that study protocols for both retrospective and prospective studies are fully compliant with all NIH- 
mandated regulatory requirements, (3) assist with the IRB protocol application writing and submission, (4) 
provide biostatistics support to confirm that experiments are designed with appropriate sample sizes or statistical 
power and the proper statistical data analysis methodologies are used to test and validate the underlying 
hypothesis with high scientific rigor, and (5) establish a unique platform that can provide RPLs and other 
researchers with the shared databases allowing access to the linked annotated medical images, biospecimens 
and clinical data necessary to facilitate their proposed research projects. Thus, the CIDRC will build a critical 
scientific and intellectual support infrastructure that aims to ensure the success of this COBRE as the RPLs

10756999,"Project 1: Neuroimaging Markers for Predicting Outcome of Brain Tumor Surgery
ABSTRACT
 Surgical resection is one of the primary treatments for human gliomas, and a growing number of studies have
demonstrated the benefits of maximal safe resection for patient survival. However, the decision of surgical
resection of tumor-infiltrated brain tissue is often difficult given the risk of inducing neurological deficits. Tumors
with ill-defined boundaries that invade and/or infiltrate eloquent areas are often incompletely resected or deemed
inoperable for fear of conferring a debilitating deficit. Nonetheless, it is increasingly acknowledged that the
functional anatomy of the human neocortex is plastic. Dramatic reorganization of functional brain regions, such
as language cortices, have been seen in patients with infiltrating tumors such as gliomas, suggesting such
patients with tumors invading functional brain areas may in fact be surgical candidates. Because it has been
demonstrated that progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients correlate with extent of
resection in surgery, patients may benefit from a more aggressive surgical strategy that accounts for the
information of functional recovery after surgery, i.e. neural plasticity. The focus of this research project is to
develop an intelligent and multimodal strategy for identifying plasticity based on images of brain connectivity that
relates to the neurological deficits after surgery in patients with focal brain gliomas involving motor and/or
language regions. Three imaging modalities including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging,
diffusion tensor imaging and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) will be used and integrated to
identify new imaging markers. The project has three Specific Aims. In patients following surgery for
motor/speech area gliomas, we will identify plasticity metrics based on multimodal connectivity mapping and
determine the relationship between plasticity metrics and neurological deficits (Aim 1) and determine whether
baseline connectivity maps and extent of resection can be used to predict plasticity (Aim 2). In addition, we will
develop an intelligent, machine learning based model that predicts the probability of long-term deficits and overall
survival (Aim 3). The success of this project can demonstrate feasibility of developing a novel multimodal-based
quantitative image marker to predict clinical outcome of brain tumor surgery and acquire the solid preliminary
data to support the research project leader (RPL) to apply for a more comprehensive NIH R01 project that aims
to further optimize and validate the new multimodality imaging technology and prediction model. The long-term
outcomes of the research effort will lead to a comprehensive understanding of neural plasticity after surgery
and develop new quantitative neuroimaging clinical markers based on the machine learning models to assist
prediction of PFS or OS of patients. Knowledge of the neural plasticity obtained from this project will serve to
leverage the plasticity into surgery planning, which we expect will improve overall survival of patients by
increasing the extent of resection, without compromising patient safety or long-term functional outcomes."
10757005,"Project 3: Early Evaluation of Ovarian Cancer Prognosis by Fusing Radiographic and Histopathologic
 Imaging Information
ABSTRACT
 As the most aggressive malignancy in gynecologic oncology, ovarian cancer is highly heterogeneous and
the tumor response to a specific chemotherapy vary significantly among patients. However, due to the lack of
accurate clinical markers to stratify patients and predict who can and cannot benefit from certain types of
chemotherapy drugs or methods, efficacy of treating ovarian cancer patients using chemotherapy is low. In order
to address and help solve this clinical challenge, the overarching objective of this project is to develop and
validate a new strategy for early prediction of tumor response to chemotherapy using a novel image marker
generated by a machine learning model that is trained using quantitative image features computed from
computer tomography (CT) and digital histopathology images. Based on the concept of Radiomics, Pathomics
and our encouraging preliminary studies, we hypothesize that the state-of-the-art data analysis technology can
fuse the valuable prognostic information from both radiographic and pathological images to generate a new
image marker, which has a high degree of association with the chemotherapy response of ovarian cancer
patients. To validate this hypothesis, we propose 4 specific aims. Aim 1: Based on a diverse patient database
at the Stephenson Cancer Center, we will assemble one retrospective and one prospective dataset, containing
a total of 420 ovarian cancer patients who have undergone chemotherapies. The dataset will include CT images,
histopathological images of tumor samples and other related clinical information of each patient. Aim 2: We will
explore and identify tumor heterogeneity-related images features computed from both CT and pathology images
after applying a new hybrid image processing scheme to accurately segment tumor volume and cancer cells.
Aim 3: We will apply feature selection methods on the initial CT/pathology feature pools to identify two optimal
feature vectors. Then, a prediction model (i.e., Bayesian belief network) will be trained to fuse optimal feature
vectors and other clinical variables to predict tumor response to therapy at early stage. Aim 4: We will conduct
a pilot prospective study to evaluate performance and robustness of the prediction model. Several statistical
methods (i.e. Cox proportional hazards analysis, receiver operation characteristic curve, confusion matrix) will
be used to evaluate the performance improvement by fusing the CT and pathology image features. We will also
validate the added prognostic value provided by the new model in the context of the existing markers. In order
to accomplish the proposed aims and research tasks, an interdisciplinary team is assembled, which includes
experts in medical imaging, gynecologic oncology, radiology and pathology from the University of Oklahoma. If
successful, this project can produce the essential preliminary data and scientific evidence to support the research
project leader (RPL) to apply for a more comprehensive research project (i.e., NIH R01) to further optimize and
validate a first-of-its-kind, robust, easy-to-use decision-making support tool, which can help clinicians (i.e.,
radiologists and oncologists) determine the optimal cancer treatment strategy for different patients."
10757007,"Effective treatment for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is a major, unmet public health need as the
response rates of the patients are often low with the traditional chemotherapy. Repurposing drugs is an
increasingly popular strategy in oncology due to the financial and logistical constraints of new drug development.
Recently, anti-parasitic drugs such as mebendazole have surfaced as repurposed oncology drugs and showed
promise in treating multiple types of tumors. The anti-parasitic drugs, fenbendazole and mebendazole, are in the
benzimidazole class and have been FDA-approved to treat pinworm and other helminthic infections in humans
and animals for decades. The selectivity of these drugs for the parasite rather than the host is explained by
irreversible blockade of glucose uptake in the parasite, leading to glycogen depletion and degeneration of the
endoplasmic reticulum with eventual cell death. In addition, both fenbendazole and mebendazole inhibit
microtubule polymerization and function in parasites but not in humans or mammals, owing to differential key
residues, which create an inaccessible hydrophobic pocket to which the anti-parasitic drugs cannot bind.
Although these seem to be the mechanisms of action in parasites, the exact mechanism of their anti-cancer
effect in human cells is unknown. In order to investigate this issue, we hypothesize that by measuring and
quantifying changes of tumor morphology, vasculature, and density using the combination of two novel highresolution tissue imaging methods including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence laminar
optical tomography (FLOT), drug mechanism of action and therapeutic effects can be accurately assessed in
vivo. The primary objective of this project is to thoroughly evaluate the anti-cancer effects of anti-parasitic drugs
in an ovarian cancer mouse model using OCT and FLOT. In order to validate our hypothesis and realize the
objective of this project, we propose the following three specific aims. Aim 1: To optimize calibration of
intraperitoneal post-necropsy tumor measurements in an ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model treated with
mebendazole using OCT and FLOT compared to standard electronic caliper measurements. Aim 2: To use OCT
and FLOT to characterize changes in blood vessel morphology upon exposure of an ovarian cancer xenograft
mouse model to mebendazole treatment. Aim 3: To use OCT and FLOT to measure superficial versus deep
tumor cell death and identify quantitative imaging markers for evaluating efficacy of mebendazole-based anticancer treatment. If successful, the results of this project will provide important information regarding anti-cancer
effects of mebendazole and also the convinced preliminary or pre-clinical data to support the research project
leader (RPL) to apply for a more comprehensive project (i.e., NIH R01 or DOD CDMRP Level 2 grant) to further
investigate and determine the optimal mechanism of applying this promising anti-parasitic drug to more
effectively treat epithelial ovarian cancer in the clinical study or trial involving human subjects."
10783095,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For decades, the mouse has been the premier animal model for studies of human disease, providing
the opportunity to explore experimental questions that are intractable for direct study in humans. As a
result, key insights have been obtained for a variety of clinical conditions. Spurred by advances in
technology and international efforts to systematically knock out all of the protein coding genes in the
genome, the number of genetically engineered mice has expanded rapidly in the past 20 years. The
responsibility for maintenance and distribution of mutant mice was initially placed on individual
investigators, which was a tremendous burden in terms of cost, labor and space. In 1999, the NIH
recognized the need for a resource to protect the investment in mutant mouse strains and ensure open
access to all biomedical researchers and established the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers
(MMRRC). Since 1999, the central goal of the MMRRC-UNC has been to work collectively with
MMRRC consortium partners to develop and maintain high standards for importation, rederivation,

UNC will continue to contribute to the goals of the Consortium in the next project period by
implementing the following Specific Aims devoted to continuing its successful role as a cryoarchive and
distribution center and incorporating research goals that synergize with and extend the value of the

cryoarchive of mouse strains. 2) Establish, maintain, and distribute a comprehensive cryoarchive for the
Collaborative Cross (CC) resource. 3) Develop and disseminate computational tools for mouse genetic
QC and genomics research, which will enhance phenotypic reproducibility. 4) Investigate the interaction
of genetics and environment on experimental variability and reproducibility.

10779266,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The aging vasculature and associated inflammation converge as a powerful force to cause two of the most
common cardiovascular conditions in older adults aged at least 75 years—heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite the negative impact of HFpEF and AMI on
morbidity and mortality among older adults, there are no evidence-based strategies to prevent HFpEF and
AMI among older adults. There is a strong biologic rationale that statins could prevent HFpEF and/or AMI
events, given their capacity to mitigate endothelial dysfunction, suppress inflammation, and prevent ischemia.
However, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date has examined whether statins can prevent incident
HFpEF and/or AMI events in adults aged at least 75 years—the subpopulation at greatest risk for these events.
The objectives of this proposal are: (1) To determine whether statins prevent incident HFpEF hospitalizations
in older adults; (2) To determine whether statins prevent AMI events in older adults; (3) To determine the
impact of relying on diagnosis codes to identify HFpEF and AMI. This project is an ancillary study to the
ongoing NIH-funded Pragmatic Evaluation of Events And Benefits of Lipid-lowering in Older Adults
(PREVENTABLE) RCT, which is examining the risks and benefits of statins in adults aged at least 75 years.
Given its size (N~20,000), duration (~4 years follow-up), and study design (double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial), PREVENTABLE offers an unprecedented opportunity to examine whether statins prevent
incident HFpEF and/or AMI events. However, the parent RCT’s reliance on diagnosis codes to ascertain
cardiovascular events will not allow detailed insights into HFpEF or AMI given the inherent limitations of
diagnosis codes to detect these events. This ancillary study will directly overcome this limitation by adding
expert-adjudicated outcomes through medical record review. This study will address a huge unmet clinical
need with high likelihood of informing clinical practice, and extend the impact of PREVENTABLE with minimal
additional burden on study sites or participants. Our team is uniquely qualified to carry out this proposed study
given our extensive experience with medical record retrieval on a national scale and with cardiovascular event
adjudication; and expertise in cardiovascular epidemiology, HFpEF, AMI, geriatric cardiology, and clinical trial
biostatistics. The long-term goal of this research is to identify prevention strategies for two of the most common
cardiovascular events among older adults. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are 1) potential
guideline-altering evidence on the effect of statins on incident HFpEF and AMI in older adults; and 2)
foundational data for optimizing the use of diagnosis codes for clinical, administrative, and research purposes
for studies of HF and AMI. This research directly addresses NHLBI Strategic Vision Objective 5 to “develop
and optimize novel… therapeutic strategies to prevent… diseases.”"

The basal ganglia serve many behavioral functions, ranging from the regulation of movements and cognition to
the modulation of valence and mood. This functional heterogeneity is reflected in the composition of the principal
output nucleus of the primate basal ganglia, the internal pallidal segment (GPi). This nucleus contains two distinct
populations of projection neurons. A major group of cells in the core of GPi projects to the ventral thalamus (and
other targets) and is known to be involved in motor functions. Much less explored is a second population of
neurons that is confined to the GPi periphery and projects exclusively to the lateral habenula (LHb). Studies in
monkeys and rodents have shown that this group of cells communicates negative valence signals to the LHb
which, in turn, regulates the activity of dopaminergic and serotonergic brainstem areas that are involved in the
control of reward responses and mood. Based on literature evidence and our preliminary data, we hypothesize
that pallidohabenular neurons differ from the pallidothalamic cells in terms of their synaptic connectivity,
neurotransmitter content and electrophysiological responses to dopamine depletion in the parkinsonian state.
To test this hypothesis, the following studies are proposed: In aim 1, we will analyze the synaptic connectivity
and prevalence of cortical glutamatergic inputs to pallidohabenular neurons, and study their anatomical
relationship to other afferents in normal and MPTP-treated parkinsonian rhesus monkeys. In aim 2, we will
compare the neurotransmitter phenotype and synaptic architecture of pallidohabenular terminals in these
animals. To achieve these goals, we will combine high-resolution 3D immuno-electron microscopy with viral
vector tracing methods. These anatomical experiments will generate in-depth knowledge of the microcircuits that
regulates the activity and synaptic transmission of primate pallidohabenular neurons in the normal and
parkinsonian states. Studies under aim 3 will functionally assess parkinsonism-associated activity changes in
pallidohabenular neurons and probe their impact upon LHb neurons, using state-of the art optotagging
approaches to identify these cells in vivo. The available evidence leads us to hypothesize that the activity of
pallidohabenular neurons is increased in the parkinsonian state, resulting in a pathological increase of LHb
neurons activity. It is possible that these rate changes are associated with oscillatory synchrony, as is the case
for other GPi neurons. Increased activity along the pallidohabenular axis could specifically contribute to the
emergence of parkinsonism-associated depression and other psychiatric features of Parkinson's disease. Given
the importance of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapy for the treatment of parkinsonism, we will also examine
whether electrical stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus alters the firing of LHb neurons, and whether such
changes correlate with the emergence of depressive-like behaviors. Taken together, the results of this project
will increase our knowledge of the anatomy and function of the primate pallidohabenular system under healthy
conditions, and elucidate changes within this system in the parkinsonian state."

Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase insufficiency syndrome (SPLIS) is an ultra-rare, devastating, often lethal inborn
error of metabolism recognized just five years ago. Most affected children exhibit a rapidly progressive form of
nephrotic (protein spilling) syndrome which leads to kidney failure, the main cause of death. Affected children
may also exhibit adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, skin and neurological defects, and immunodeficiency.
Although kidney transplantation may be lifesaving, there is no cure for SPLIS. SPLIS is caused by recessive
mutations in SGPL1, which encodes sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase, a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme
responsible for catabolism of the bioactive lipid S1P in the final step of sphingolipid metabolism. SPLIS is a
member of a new family of non-lysosomal sphingolipid disorders about which relatively little is known. Despite
the dismal outcome in SPLIS, targeted therapies are rapidly being developed. Some children with milder forms
of the condition may respond to supplementation with vitamin B6, the enzyme’s cofactor. Studies in a mouse
model of SPLIS have provided proof-of-concept for the use of adeno-associated virus-mediated SGPL1 gene
therapy as a universal and potentially curative treatment for SPLIS. Clinical trials testing these two therapeutic
strategies are on the horizon. Although we have made rapid progress in methods of SPLIS patient finding,
biomarker development, and therapeutics, achieving two additional goals will enhance our readiness to
undertake SPLIS clinical trials: a) providing a comprehensive understanding of the natural history of SPLIS
including the full spectrum of clinical presentations, disease subgroups, and natural progression; b) developing
a method to identify SPLIS patients before irreversible kidney damage has occurred. We are now in a pivotal
position to achieve both these strategic goals. We hypothesize that specific disease features and biomarkers
will predict quality of life and survival in SPLIS patients. To confirm our hypothesis and achieve our goals, we
propose three Aims: 1) Characterize the spectrum of SPLIS clinical presentations and their natural progression
over time; 2) Determine how biomarker endpoints reflect or predict functional change over time in SPLIS
patients; 3) Establish a screening strategy for early detection of SPLIS based on blood S1P levels. In achieving
these Aims, we will develop a deeper understanding of the spectrum, sequence, and timing of onset of SPLIS
manifestations, and will identify predictors of disease outcomes that are meaningful to patients and families
and that will be critical for patient selection for clinical trial enrollment. Our project will create useful tools for
measuring outcomes in SPLIS, providing quantifiable endpoints to be used in clinical trials. Overall, revealing
the natural history of SPLIS will lay the foundation for evaluating the impact of targeted interventions in clinical
trials. Developing early detection methods will open a therapeutic window in which treatments to prevent death
and the need for kidney transplantation can be administered. Creation of biospecimen collections and stem cell
lines will facilitate deeper investigation into the pathophysiology of SPLIS and its related sphingolipid disorders."
10925367,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a leading cause of preventable harm in U.S. hospitals. Hospitals
are therefore required to report selected HAIs, including central line-associated bloodstream infections,
catheter-associated urinary tract infections, colon and abdominal hysterectomy surgical site infections,
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and Clostridioides difficile infections, to the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) via CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network. These data are used to
benchmark hospitals and to inform CMS’s pay-for performance programs. In many cases, however, conducting
surveillance for HAIs is complicated, resource intensive, and prone to high levels of interobserver variability.
Furthermore, many of the most common and morbid HAIs, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia and most
non-line associated bloodstream infections, are not routinely tracked or reported and are therefore largely
neglected by hospitals. Our underlying hypothesis is that electronic surveillance for hospital-onset sepsis
could provide a more complete, efficient, and objective method to identify a fuller array of the most serious
HAIs compared to current surveillance methods. In particular, CDC’s hospital-onset Adult Sepsis Event
definition uses routine electronic clinical data to identify patients with concurrent clinical indicators of presumed
serious infections (blood culture orders and antibiotic treatment) and concurrent organ dysfunction (initiation of
vasopressors or mechanical ventilation or significant changes in laboratory values). Preliminary data suggest
that CDC’s hospital-onset sepsis surveillance definition may identify many more HAIs than current CMS
reportable metrics and that hospital-onset sepsis is associated with very high mortality rates even when
reportable HAIs are absent. Before hospitals and policymakers consider routinely tracking hospital-onset
sepsis, however, data from diverse settings are needed to understand its incidence and variation across
hospitals, its impact on long-term outcomes, and the specific infections leading to sepsis. This proposal will
address these gaps through the following Specific Aims: 1) Characterize the incidence, in-hospital mortality,
and hospital-level variation for hospital-onset sepsis versus currently reportable HAIs, 2) Determine the impact
of hospital-onset sepsis versus reportable HAIs on patients’ long-term outcomes, and 3) Develop electronic
algorithms using clinical and administrative data to automatically identify the types of infections precipitating
hospital-onset sepsis. This work will be conducted using detailed clinical data from 145 HCA Healthcare
hospitals that collectively care for more than 1.7 million inpatients per year (approximately 5% of U.S. acute
care hospitalizations). In Aim 2, we will also link HCA data to CMS claims data to accurately capture post-
discharge outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. This proposal directly addresses the goals of AHRQ and its
HAI Prevention Portfolio by providing the foundation for a new HAI surveillance paradigm that will help identify
new targets for prevention and quality improvement and thereby help catalyze better outcomes for patients."

Lead (Pb) is an everyday contaminant with low level exposure rates of one in every three children worldwide. A
major source of exposure to this heavy metal is via drinking water delivered through Pb lines. Children are
particularly vulnerable, with an exposure rate of up to 800 million globally, as they absorb Pb differently than
adults. Even children exposed to very low levels of Pb often go on to experience intellectual deficits with
associative macroscopic changes in the brain. While many of these poor neurological outcomes are ascribed to
the ability of Pb to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), how the affects of Pb on other compartments of the body
contribute to an underdeveloped brain remains largely unknown. The gut brain-axis has recently been brought
into clinical and preclinical spotlights as accumulating evidence confer bidirectional communication between the
two organs. As a collective, the microorganisms/microbiota colonizing the vertebrate gut play a commensal role
in training the immune system and promoting healthy brain development. This is particularly evident in cases of
gut dysbiosis associated with an array of neurological diseases/disorders of developmental origins. Upon Pb
contaminated water consumption, the gut microbiota is amongst the first exposed and are readily altered in
species composition which has been reported in a limited number of preclinical animal studies. However, how
Pb-induced gut dysbiosis impacts the enteric and central nervous system independent of Pb entry systemically
remains elusive. Building on a novel germ-free piglet paradigm developed by our group, we will test the central
hypothesis that low level Pb exposure impairs brain development by altering the gut microbiome which in turn
negatively impacts distinct central and enteric nervous system cell types. We will employ a multipronged
approach to test the following three independent yet complementary Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects
of a Pb-altered microbiome on key neurodevelopmental trajectories by recolonizing germ-free piglets with donor
gut microbiota exposed to low doses of Pb orally. This will enable us to rule out any direct effects of Pb on the
brain via entry through the blood brain barrier. In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize alterations that occur
in the gut microbiome after Pb exposure. Using multiomics and several other in vivo and in vitro techniques, we
will evaluate changes in microbial diversity, metabolites, and host physiology. Aim 3 will include assessments of
both compartments to interrogate direct and indirect Pb-induced alterations in distinct central and enteric nervous
system cell types. Completion of these studies will provide mechanistic insights on the cellular, microbial, and
systems level and illuminate new aspects of Pb exposure that may lead to novel strategies for targeted
therapeutic interventions to improve neurological outcomes in children exposed to Pb."

High titers of anti-NMDAR1 IgG autoantibodies in brain cause anti-NMDAR1 encephalitis that exhibits
psychosis, impaired memory, and many other psychiatric symptoms in addition to neurological symptoms. We
found that blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 IgG autoantibodies are sufficient to impair spatial working memory
(p=2.02E-08, power: 1) with a large effect size (d=2.3) in the integrity of the blood-brain barriers (BBB). Low
titers of natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies, predominantly IgM or IgA isotype, were reported in the blood of
~5-10% of the general human population and psychiatric patients. It is unknown whether chronic presence of
these natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies may impact human cognitive functions. After quantifying the levels
of plasma natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies in 143 Marines, we found that Marines with higher levels of
natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies have significantly better cognitive functions in both Continuous
Performance Test (reaction time in CPT, p=0.00029) and Short Letter N-Back test (reaction time in SLNB,
p=0.00091) than Marines with lower levels of the autoantibodies. Consistent with the pro-cognition, high levels
of natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies protect (p=0.048) from the development of TBI-associated symptoms.
Anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies had been reported to provide protections against neuronal excitotoxicity caused
by excessive glutamate in neurological diseases. Therefore, it appears that blood circulating anti-NMDAR1
autoantibodies may have two opposing effects. Synaptic NMDARs are essential for cognitive function and
their activation promotes neuronal survival, whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs is responsible for
neuronal excitotoxicity. Unlike small IgG, IgM antibodies (diameter of ~30 nm) are physically too large to enter
synaptic cleft (width: 20-30 nm) to suppress synaptic NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission but are restricted to
bind extrasynaptic NMDARs and therefore specifically inhibit neuronal excitotoxicity. Hence, we hypothesize
that blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 IgM autoantibodies are both neuroprotective and pro-cognitive, whereas
blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 IgG and IgA autoantibodies are detrimental to cognitive functions. We propose
two specific aims for this 3-year R01 application. In Aim 1, we will validate pro-cognitive and neuroprotective
functions of pre-existing IgM anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies by quantifying plasma anti-NMDAR1 IgM, IgA, IgG
autoantibodies, respectively, in humans. In Aim 2, we will cross-species validate pro-cognition and
neuroprotection of IgM anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies by generating mice carrying either IgM or (IgG and IgA)
only anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies. Immunogold electron microscopy will be used to validate that IgM anti-
NMDAR1 autoantibodies can only bind extrasynaptic NMDAR1 but not synaptic NMDAR1 in brain. Success of
the proposed studies will open up a new avenue for the development of therapeutic IgM anti-NMDAR1
autoantibodies that can promote cognitive functions and protect from neuronal excitotoxicity in many
neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders including TBI, PTSD, and schizophrenia."

 Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in
the USA. Immune checkpoint therapy (ICI) is revolutionizing the therapy of a number of malignancies, including
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoints, such as by anti-PD-1,
removes the tumor-initiated suppression of the immune system and unleashes prolonged anti-tumor immunity.
Despite the encouraging success, many patients develop severe and sometimes life-threating adverse effects,
or many also fail to benefit from immunotherapy. Existing immune therapy response predictive markers have
only modest positive predictive values and there are no clinically useful markers of toxicity. Our proposed study
will focus on comprehensive evaluation of serological auto-antibodies (AAb) as potential predictors of immune
related adverse event (irAE) and benefit from therapy. Serum based biomarkers exploit easy sample
accessibility and directly measure immune responses. Our platform can be rapidly adopted for clinical use.
 Our study leverages collaboration between experts on immunoproteomics and biomarker discovery and
physician scientists specializing in breast cancer. Our study will analyze more than 3000 longitudinal serum
samples collected from 1,195 patients enrolled in a randomized phase III trial (SWOG S1418) that tests the
efficacy of one year of single agent adjuvant pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) therapy compared to
observation in high risk TNBC. Serum samples were collected at baseline and at 13 and 55 weeks after
starting therapy, all samples are annotated with detailed toxicity and outcome information that were collected
during this FDA registration trial. We will employ two complementary high-throughput antibody profiling
technologies including Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) and Multiple In Solution Antibody
Assay (MISPA) that we developed. NAPPA allows the detection of antibodies against tens of thousands freshly
produced full length proteins in hundreds of samples while MISPA enables more precise quantification of
hundreds of antibodies in thousands of samples and could be scaled for clinical use. Our approach involves (i)
a discovery step using the NAPPA arrays that will interrogate serum samples for AAbs against 18,000 human
proteins in the discovery cohort, (ii) a verification step of identified outcome-predictive AAb using the MISPA
platform using the discovery samples to select the final set of candidate markers, (iii) and blinded validation of
candidate AAb using MISPA on the held out validation set. Identification of biomarkers that can predict
clinically-relevant immune-related adverse events or recurrence, and hence inefficacy of therapy, would help
better estimate the risk benefit ratio of these very expensive and potentially toxic therapies. Predictors of
adverse events could also influence patient monitoring and allow earlier therapeutic intervention. The lessons
learned from this proposed study on TNBC will likely impact a broad spectrum of other cancers since adverse
events are not cancer type dependent."
10761694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect, affecting 0.5-2% of all live births. As medical and
surgical advances have dramatically increased survival, the burgeoning population of children and adults with
congenital heart disease has exposed a high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities in survivors. By
adolescence, more than 2 out of every 3 children with critical congenital heart disease experience deficits
requiring developmental/special education services. As these children reach adulthood, their disabilities may
limit educational opportunities, employment, and quality of life.
Abnormal fetal brain development may contribute to neurodevelopmental disability in patients with congenital
heart disease. Neonates with congenital heart disease have abnormal brain structure before surgery.
Neurobiological processes that lay the foundation for long-term structural brain organization begin in utero.
Components of fetal brain critical for this process, in particular neural progenitor cells, premyelinating
oligodendrocytes, and subplate neurons, are sensitive to hypoxia-ischemia, rendering this system vulnerable to
prenatal circulatory disturbances. The impact of abnormal fetal brain development on long-term brain structure
and function in congenital heart disease is unknown. To date, there are no congenital heart disease cohorts
that have been studied in both the fetal period and later in childhood when these deficits are typically detected.
This proposal will leverage an existing fetal MRI cohort, including children both with and without congenital
heart disease, to acquire long-term neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental data at 7 years of age, thereby
determining the fetal contribution to long-term outcome. Specifically, the proposed study will investigate 1) the
association between fetal brain structure and school-age structural brain connectivity; 2) the relationship
between fetal brain structure and school-age neurodevelopmental functioning; and 3) the potential for a clinical
risk stratification tool harnessing measures available in utero to predict school-age neurodevelopmental
outcome. The overarching hypothesis is that abnormal fetal brain structure is associated with long-term
differences in structural brain connectivity and neurodevelopmental functioning in congenital heart disease.
This project will support the development of clinical risk stratification and advance the development of
interventions designed to protect the brain in children with congenital heart disease."

Nytricx is developing a new class of Nitric Oxide (NO)-releasing intravascular medical catheters to combat
infection and thrombosis associated with indwelling vascular catheters. NO gas is a natural anti-infective and
anti-thrombotic human product principally released from blood vessels and immune cells. Nytricx NO-releasing
technology to the catheter surfaces via a polymer matrix, mimics the natural release by cells to prevent infection
and thrombosis. The Nytricx technology is designed to combine anti-infective and anti-thrombotic properties of
Nitric Oxide (NO) release at the internal and external catheter interfaces, which may be an extremely effective
means to prolong catheter life, decrease chronic infection, and blood clotting (thrombosis) associated with
intravascular catheters. The combination of a novel topcoats with NO gas release from the base silicone polymer
is unique, especially considering that the NO donor itself stays embedded in the polymer with only the NO gas
escaping to affect the external and internal catheter environments. The topcoat also affects biofilm formation
which is also a chronic problem associated with catheter infections preventing effective antibiotic therapy. Nytricx
NO-releasing technology represents a disruptive innovation that will result in saving patients’ lives and cutting
medical costs, especially those related to hospital acquired blood steam infections and thrombosis, associated
with intravascular catheters."
10782966,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Plant natural products (NPs) are a critical source of clinically approved drugs and dietary nutrients, yet very few
complete biosynthetic pathways have been characterized. As a consequence, many complex plant natural
product scaffolds are currently still isolated from the producing plant or plant cell culture and then converted to a
clinically-used drug by semisynthetic routes (e.g. etoposide, digoxin, morphine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel – all
on the 2015 WHO list of essential medicines). Lack of information regarding their biosynthetic pathways severely
limits the use of promising new approaches to produce plant molecules in heterologous hosts (e.g. yeast strains
that make artemisinin), as well as the intriguing possibility of engineering the biosynthetic pathways to access
analogs and non-natural derivatives with greater efficacy. Even less is known about pathways that could be the
target of engineering or breeding efforts in edible plants to improve nutrient content. Given the critical role of
plant natural products in human health and utility of biosynthetic genes, we propose here the development
and application of a broadly generalizable platform to accelerate the discovery and engineering of key
plant natural product pathways.
One of the most challenging steps limiting the discovery of plant pathways to date is the identification of candidate
biosynthetic genes. Here we propose three complementary approaches for pathway elucidation that we
anticipate will enable access to small molecules with diverse biological activities relevant to human health: (1)
comparative transcriptomics for branching families of plant natural products, (2) gene-to-metabolite correlation
to uncover pathways that require whole-plant coordination for biosynthesis, and (3) gene-centric discovery
targeting privileged pathway enzymes. These approaches have recently enabled the discovery of an 8-gene
pathway to colchicine alkaloids, and engineering of this pathway into a heterologous production host. In this
proposal we have prioritized pathway for clinically used NPs (homoharringtonine [Synribo] and galantamine
[Razadyne]), molecules with immune modulatory activity in edible plants (tomato glycoalkaloids), and clinical
candidates whose assessment would be enabled by access to the native compound or analogs (limonoids,
huperzines, and indolizidine alkaloids). These compounds represent a diverse set of NP classes and will be used
to demonstrate the broad utility of our discovery approach. A major outcome of this work will be sets of
biosynthetic genes that can be used to engineer heterologous hosts to make plant NPs and analogs with potent
biological activity of relevance to human health."

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has caused profound socioeconomic challenges for humankind. Antiviral agents
blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication that complement vaccination are urgently needed to stop
the current pandemic and to avoid potential future outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro),
an essential cysteine protease that regulates viral replication and host immune sensing, is a
promising antiviral target against SARS-CoV-2. However, the rapid development of potent PLpro
inhibitors has been hindered by limited draggable interactions at the active site due to restricted
P1 and P2 sites with glycine recognition. To address these challenges, we have investigated
novel, druggable binding sites, distal to the active site, using structure-guided design and X-ray
crystallography. These efforts led to a series of 2-phenylthiophene-based inhibitors with low
nanomolar potency. Crystal structures revealed that these potent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors
engage with a novel ligand-binding site, the “BL2 groove”, leading to slower off-rates, improved
binding affinities, and low micromolar antiviral potency in SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells.
Moreover, these inhibitors showed good microsomal stability and in vivo exposure after
intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Building on these encouraging preliminary data, we propose in
this project to further optimize and develop these novel PLpro inhibitors to achieve in vivo antiviral
efficacy. We propose: Aim 1) to optimize our lead PLpro inhibitors for improved potency and drug-
likeness properties using structure-guided design; Aim 2) to evaluate and triage PLpro inhibitors
based on biochemical, ADME, and antiviral assays; Aim 3) to assess the PK/PD profile of top
inhibitors and to establish in vivo antiviral efficacy. Completion of the research will lead to small
molecules suitable for development as drug candidates to treat SARS-CoV-2."

George Mason University (GMU) Biomedical Laboratory (BRL) is one of 12 Regional
Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) established through NIAID support in the early 2000s to
serve as Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities to conduct cutting edge pathogen research and
serve as resources to rapidly address emerging infectious disease outbreaks. The BRL serves
as a center for scientific collaboration to 1) generate advanced knowledge of pathogen biology
and host interaction mechanisms, and 2) evaluate diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic exposed critical
vulnerabilities to the nation’s BSL-3 research infrastructure, including the GMU BRL facility.
GMU learned that there are gaps and opportunities to enhance safe BRL operations
management to more effectively face sudden disease outbreaks and support a more robust
pipeline of innovations for response to future pandemics. This proposal outlines activities for
three cores to enhance the BRL facility, increase high containment training, and provide
additional BSL-3 research services for pre-clinical innovation. The GMU RBL will 1) Implement a
comprehensive BSL-3 facilities preventative maintenance and upgrade plan to ensure continuity
of operations, compliance with federal regulations, and a safe and secure facility; 2) Enhance
safety and quality of BSL-3 laboratory practices; and 3) Create two new research cores in high
containment. The expanded Microphysiological Systems (MPS) core will enable organ-on-a-
chip (OOC) and organoid models for lead optimization, safety assessment, off target effects,
toxicity, and efficacy analysis. The Advanced Animal Research (AAR) core will support pre-
clinical studies starting with in vivo exposures and countermeasure testing and transitioning to
advanced animal imaging, spatial tissue, and cellular analysis. Together, the cores will
accelerate vaccine and therapeutic drug discovery and improve understanding of the
transmission and pathogenesis of infectious agents as well as host response."

Among all different types of DNA damages, double strand breaks (DSBs) are viewed as the most toxic ones
that lead to genome instability. They are created by either endogenous agents such as reactive oxygen
species, or exogenous ionizing radiation and chemicals. Unrepaired DSBs drive apoptosis and senescence,
and incorrect DSB repair can lead to undesired genome rearrangements, such as deletions, translocations,
and fusions. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, in which the two broken DNA ends are directly
ligated without referring to a homologous template, is the primary DSB repair pathway that remains active
throughout the cell cycle. NHEJ is also responsible for the assembly of gene segments in V(D)J recombination,
where various immunoglobulin genes are generated by exon recombination in immune cells. NHEJ is initialized
by Ku heterodimer (Ku70/80) recognizing DSB ends. Upon recognizing a dsDNA broken end, Ku70/80 recruits
the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and assembles into the so-called DNA-PK
holoenzyme. Other evolutionarily conserved NHEJ factors, including components of the ligase complex (DNA
ligase IV, XRCC4 and XLF) are then recruited to the end reparation site. Successful DSB repair through NHEJ
relies on the efficient bridging of two broken DNA ends, and this proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of
NHEJ by directly visualizing the key steps of repair using single-particle cryo-EM. A more refined picture of the
system specifically recognizing and correcting DSBs will provide an unprecedented, comprehensive view of
these essential molecular machines during operation, and could lead to the development of novel treatments
for various types of human cancer."

Functional genome wide association studies have indicated that dysregulated microglia activation
is a major contributing factor for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease
(AD). Thus, regulating the microglia activation state could have profound therapeutic potential for
AD. However, the underlying mechanisms by which microglia transition between different states
during normal and disease conditions are largely unknown. S1P-signaling has been implicated to
play important roles in AD. Yet the function of S1P in AD is not clear due to conflicting reports.
On one hand, the level of S1P is reduced in postmortem AD patient brains, suggesting a
protective role of S1P. On the other hand, there are also reports indicating that S1P might play
the opposite. Although has been tested in Aβ-related AD mouse models, the role of FTY720 in
tau pathology is elusive. Further, FTY720 can have different function depending on the cellular
context and treatment procedure, which makes interpretation of S1P's role challenging. Thus, the
function of S1P-signaling in AD is more complex than assumed and demands further investigation
Our preliminary studies suggest that Spinster homolog 2 (Spns2), an S1P transporter, critically
modulates microglial transition from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory states when treated with
Aβ peptide. This data is interesting in that it reveals microglia states could be regulated through
Spns2 and/or S1P. Since microglia form the first and major line of immune defense in the central
nervous system, we will mainly investigate the function of Spns2 on microglia activation in this
application. The role of astrocytes, the other major glial cell type, and other S1P transporters such
as ABCA1, will also be evaluated. Our goal is to define the function and underlying mechanism
of Spns2 in microglial responses in AD. Our goal is to define the function and underlying
mechanism of Spns2 in microglial responses in AD. Our overarching hypothesis is that Spns2
contributes to AD pathogenesis by promoting microglial pro-inflammatory activation induced by
AD-related stimuli. We will Test that (1) Spns2 enhances pro-inflammatory responses in microglia

a unique premise to reveal novel aspects of S1P-signaling in AD pathogenesis."

 More than 12 million children in the U.S. consume up to two-thirds of their dietary intake in early care and
education (ECE) settings.1,2 Yet, educators in ECE often use dietary and feeding practices that are not
evidence-based.3 Given that childhood dietary habits often persist into adulthood,4–6 failure to use evidence-
based practices (EBPs) related to healthy nutrition and feeding patterns can have negative implications for
development of weight trajectories and dietary patterns across the lifespan. The overall objective for this
application is to determine the effectiveness and associated mechanisms of a package of deimplementation
strategies to reduce the use of inappropriate feeding practices in ECE. Demonstrating the effectiveness of
strategies for reducing inappropriate feeding practices in ECE and determining how the strategies work and for
whom will provide new opportunities for building a strong foundation in the ECE setting for lifelong healthy
eating habits. We will conduct a cluster-randomized Hybrid Type III trial with 88 ECE sites serving children
ages 3 and 5. The trial will achieve two specific aims:
 Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of a package of deimplementation strategies for reducing the
use of inappropriate feeding practices in ECE. Our hypothesis is that, compared to usual practice, the
deimplementation strategies will be effective at reducing the total number of observed inappropriate feeding
practices per meal, our primary deimplementation outcome (N= 88 sites, 528 educators).3 We will also identify
effects on secondary effectiveness outcome measures including child body mass index, willingness to try novel
foods, fear of new foods (i.e., neophobia), and dietary intake (N=1320 children).
 Aim 2: Identify mechanisms of deimplementation using a mixed methods approach. Our hypothesis
is that factors specified by the Implementation Trust Building Theory of Change22 will mediate the effect of
strategies on deimplementation outcomes. Using an explanatory, sequential design, we will collect qualitative
data with purposively selected educators (N = 32) to identify emergent mediators and moderators.
 The project will determine the effectiveness of a blended in-person and virtual approach to
deimplementation with scalable tailoring elements. In addition, we expect to have determined key mechanisms
of our deimplementation strategies, providing practice-relevant information on how and why strategies work to
change behavior in the real world and informing future replication and scale-up. These results are expected to
have a positive impact on the weight and dietary behaviors of young children through the targeted removal of
inappropriate feeding practices in ECE."

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), an important human pathogen, establishes life-long
latency in neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG) and CNS, including brainstem.
External stressors periodically trigger reactivation from latency, resulting in recurrent
ocular disease and encephalitis. The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone
significantly enhances reactivation from latency in HSV-1 latently infected mice.
Conversely, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist significantly reduces reactivation
from latency. A transcription factor activated by the Wnt pathway, b-catenin, is
expressed in more TG neurons during latency relative to stress induced reactivation
suggesting b-catenin maintains latency. GR and a stress induced transcription factor,
Krüppel like transcription factor 15 (KLF15), form a feed forward loop that synergistically
transactivates viral immediate early promoters required for productive infection. Based
on these exciting unpublished studies, we hypothesize that stress, via GR activation, has
multi-pronged effects on the latency-reactivation cycle. An important early step during
reactivation is a stressful stimulus disrupts latency by suppressing the canonical Wnt/b-
catenin signaling pathway. A second early step is GR and KLF15 cooperatively
stimulate viral gene expression, ultimately leading to virus production. Studies in this
proposal will directly test this hypothesis. For Aim 1, HSV-1 reactivation from latency will
be compared in mice that do not express GR in TG or KLF15 knockout mice relative to
wild-type mice. For Aim 2, we will investigate how GR and KLF15 synergistically
activate viral transcription. Finally, differentially expressed genes associated with the
Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway will be identified during latency and reactivation from
latency (Aim 3). Completion of these studies will reveal how stress disrupts latency and
directly stimulates viral gene expression.

10777560,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
We propose that artificial intelligence (AI) screening for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can improve
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) identification, and eliminate structured biases that
disproportionately cause diagnostic delay in women and non-white patients. Every year 26 million
patients visit EDs for ACS evaluation. All need an ECG in a critical 10-minute window of time after arrival to
diagnose the most time-sensitive and life-threatening form of ACS, STEMI. These early ECGs occur before
physician evaluation. In our prior work, every 1-minute reduction in time to ECG yielded a 1.24-minute
reduction in the time to STEMI treatment, and every minute improves ACS clinical outcomes. Yet 37% of
STEMI patients do not receive an ECG within 10-minutes. Those experiencing ECG delay disproportionately
include women and non-white patients. These patients are twice as likely to die within 1 week compared to
those receiving an ECG within the 10-minute window (11% vs 5%, p=0.02). These unacceptable findings need
a diagnostic improvement solution.
We will address this challenge by developing diversity-inclusive ACS screening artificial intelligence (AI) that
will support ED care to 1) prevent missing STEMI patients by improving on the existing oversimplified manual
screening practice, and 2) eliminate structured biases disproportionately impacting women and non-white
patients for whom we will improve diagnostic precision. Our proposal aims to reduce disparities in timely care
and mortality to improve equity via 2 innovative contributions. First, we will test the desktop-to-bedside
translation of a predictive model that out-performs manual screening. Second, we will improve the model by
including considerations for risk diversity and leveraging the calculation strength of machine learning to
improve ACS prediction.
Our goal is to reduce mortality for all by bridging a translational research gap. The impact of overcoming these
practice limitations is that we will validate a pathway to reduce delays in STEMI identification. We will also
close a clinical outcome disparity between women and men, and patients of non-white and white races. Our
multidisciplinary team of experts in emergency medicine, interventional cardiology, predictive modeling,
biostatistics, and clinical informatics have the expertise to successfully execute this proposal."

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process resulting in the monoallelic, parent-of-origin-
specific expression of a small subset of genes (<150) in the mammalian genome.Imprinted
genes are essentialduring and post-embryonic development and defects in dosage imbalance of
imprinted genes result in complex rare epigenetic diseases generally involving multiple tissues,
named Imprinting Disorders(IDs).Within an imprinted domain, DNA sequence elements named
Imprinting Control Regions(ICRs) regulate imprinted expression of genes and are differentially
marked by DNA methylation during gametogenesis when maternal and paternal genomes are
still in distinct partitions.How ICRs bring about imprinted gene expression and what trans acting
protein factors and complexes that occupy parental ICR alleles are required for establishment
and maintenance of imprinted patterns of gene expression still remain mostly unknown. The
main objective of this proposalis to elucidate the protein assemblies on parental alleles of
imprint control regions to understand how cis regulation by trans factors maintain the parent-of-
origin expression. We will accomplish this by employing the relatively new methodologies of
locus specific genome targeting and intracellular protein labeling. In the first aim, multiple
transgenic reciprocal hybrid ES lines will be utilized to decipher the maternal or paternal ICR
allele specific protein complexes. In the second aim we will test how depletion of cis acting
RNAs and associated loss of ICR enhancer function affects the protein complexes on maternal
allele.Finally, in the third aim, we will focus to quantitate the molecular proteomic changes in ES
cells with uniparental disomies to understand ICR functions in imprinted disorders. Together,
our studies will i) illuminate parental ICR allele specific protein complexes, ii) define ICR derived
cis elements required for their protein complex localization/imprinting function and iii) define
differential protein complexes in uniparental chromosomal disomies. Findings from this study
will lead to a greater understanding of the trans protein factors at Imprint Control Regions and
will provide mechanistic details into cis regulation of ICR functions in an unbiased manner."

Renal macrophages (RMs) are myeloid cells residing in renal tissue that fulfill specific renal functions including
homeostasis, immune surveillance, and repair. RMs account for about 50% of total CD45+ leukocytes in
mouse kidneys and are also found in large numbers in the human kidney. They consist of embryo-derived
(EMRMs) and bone marrow (BM)-derived RMs (BMRMs). Recently, Ide, et al. found that yolk-sac-derived renal
macrophages (YSRMs)[5] contribute a very small portion of RMs at birth, but progressively expand in number
with age and become a major contributor to the RM population in older mice. The macrophages’ niche in
tissues such as brain, liver, and lung may determine the specific functions of the tissue macrophages (TMs).
Only a small number of the niche signals have been described for these TMs, and the specific molecular
mechanism underlying RM regeneration has not been studied. Understanding the mechanisms of the RM
niches will be critical to the development of therapeutics for kidney diseases that block or induce specific
signaling pathways. How RM niches impact RM longevity, fate, dynamics, and immune metabolic responses
remains unclear. To address these questions, we have applied a recently generated Cre induced-human CD59
transgenic line (ihCD59) to trace RM lineage and determine the intrinsic properties of RMs of BM or embryonic
origins. We find that RMs are mainly derived from fetal liver monocytes before birth, but self-maintain through
adulthood with contributions from peripheral monocytes. At a steady state, deficiency of CX3CR1, but not of
CCR2, significantly reduces the number of RMs, but not microglia, from birth through adulthood. Our
preliminary results suggest the CX3CR1/CX3CL1 axis is indispensable for specific regeneration and
maintenance of RMs. Although the role of CX3CR1/CX3CL1 in the progression of various diseases in tissues
(including kidney tissue) has been recognized for many years, its critical role in this niche signaling for RMs of
BM, embryonic, and yolk-sac origins has not been studied. Fractalkine/CX3CL1 exists as a membrane-
anchored molecule as well as in soluble form, each mediating different biological activities. However, the roles
for these two types of CX3CL1 in RM regeneration and maintenance remain unknown. Therefore, we propose
to examine our working hypothesis that the CX3CL1 signaling pathway is critical for CX3CR1+RM longevity,
fate, dynamics, and immune metabolic responses under normal (Aim 1) and pathological conditions (Aim 2). In
Aim 3, we will examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the CX3CR1/CX3CL1 axis contributes
specifically to RM regeneration and maintenance. Successful completion of these Aims will advance our
understanding of tissue macrophage biology, and specifically of RMs which will allow for improved design and
development of therapeutics for kidney disease that block or induce specific signaling pathways."
10861912,"Memory impairment emerges in diverse, clinically-significant conditions spanning all stages of life. After a
memory has been encoded, its retrieval is believed to occur through the reactivation of an engram, the
physiological substrate of memory. Engrams are partitioned into neuronal ensembles—small groups of
functionally-related neurons—that are dispersed throughout the brain. Direct optogenetic stimulation of
engram cells in the hippocampus has proven sufficient to trigger the coordinated reactivation of these
dispersed ensembles. The primary output node of the hippocampus, the subiculum, has proven critical to
the integrity of memory retrieval and is robustly associated with the memory impairments observed in
Alzheimer’s disease. However, despite a rich history of memory research in the hippocampal formation, the
subiculum and its role in memory remain critically understudied. Remarkably, recent evidence indicates the
integrity of the subiculum may be critical for memory retrieval without being necessary for encoding. Identifying
the unique role of the subiculum in memory retrieval is thus a central question in memory research. To address
this gap in knowledge, I will leverage large-scale two-photon calcium imaging alongside holographic
photostimulation to decode and manipulate subicular activity during memory retrieval in mice. I will test the
hypothesis that conjunctive-coding and recurrent-modularity in the subiculum facilitate the coordinated
reactivation of neuronal ensembles during memory retrieval. I have constructed an experimental setup in
which I am able to simultaneously measure (two-photon calcium imaging) and manipulate neural activity (two-
photon holographic optogenetics) in mice during a closed-loop fear conditioning assay. I have found that
partially-overlapping neuronal ensembles in the subiculum encode a variety of task-relevant features during
retrieval, including the temporal gap between the retrieval cue and the anticipated aversive stimuli. In the F99
phase, I will test the hypothesis that the activation of subsets of the identified neuronal ensembles
preferentially drive intra-ensemble activity. To do so, I will be trained in and use two-photon holographic
optogenetics to selectively stimulate arbitrary subsets of intra-ensemble and random neurons. Simultaneously,
I will record the activity of these neurons using two-photon calcium imaging in order to determine whether
stimulation drives persistent activity on an order of magnitude longer than photostimulation duration and
whether such activity is specific to ensemble neurons. In the K00 phase, I will investigate the coordination of
subicular and cortical activity during memory retrieval, and its perturbation in disease. This proposal will
establish a causal understanding of subicular dynamics during memory retrieval, a deeper understanding of
the coordination of memory retrieval across brain regions, and nurture the development of an independent
researcher from a disadvantaged background at the cutting-edge of memory research."

Genetically engineered (GE) animal models are essential for generating biomedical models for human disease

The use of GE large animal models such as pigs often results in clinically relevant outcomes as their physiology
and anatomy resemble humans. For example, introducing genetic elements responsible for cystic fibrosis and
immunodeficiency to the pig genome induces GE pigs to closely recapitulate symptoms of the diseases. However,
GE pigs are not widely available in biomedicine due to the amount of time required to establish such models. As
a large animal species, a single round of breeding in pigs takes at least one year and often multiple rounds of

concerns over unintended genome alterations from genome editing procedure and days required to introduce
targeted modifications in pigs as a large animal model impedes wide use of the technology. Our objective of
this project is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of genome editing technology and design novel approaches
that will assist in rapid phenotyping of animal models after a targeted genome editing event. Three specific aims
are proposed to reach our goal. First, we will generate methods for global detection of off-targeting events in GE
pigs. Secondly, we will develop strategies to secure genome integrity during the genome editing process. Finally,
we propose to develop a strategy to rapidly phenotype GE fetuses and to modify the genome of wild-type pigs.

technology and GE pig models will be employed to complete the proposed aims. Outcomes of this project should
increase the availability of GE pig models in biomedicine and agriculture by effectively capturing subsequent
phenotypes after genome editing events. We propose to utilize pigs as a model to investigate the efficacy of the
proposed strategies; however, our findings should be easily transferred to producing other animal models in
biomedicine and agriculturally important species, as well. Given the importance of pigs used as animal models,
our findings should be beneficial to both NIH and USDA agencies."

Many chronic pain conditions that affect craniofacial regions, such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD),
disproportionately affect females. A growing number of studies show strong evidence that sex-related differences
in conditioned pain modulation (CPM), a psychophysical index of endogenous pain inhibition, is one mechanism
that predisposes women to an increased risk of chronic pain conditions. However, the central mechanisms
underlying gender differences in CPM, as well as causal links between dysfunctional CPM and chronic orofacial
pain conditions, are largely unknown. Our prior work has shown that there are sex differences in descending
noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), a measure that is similar to CPM in preclinical settings, and that DNIC is
modulated in a testosterone (TS)-dependent manner. The efficiency of DNIC was stronger in males compared
to females. A pharmacological blockade of androgen receptors attenuated DNIC in males, and TS replacement
enhanced DNIC in female rats. We also provided compelling evidence that the efficient DNIC in males is
associated with a stronger resting functional connectivity between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)
and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). These observations provide a strong rationale for investigating the impact
of TS on central pain modulation, and they also have significant clinical implications for pain management for
both transgender and cisgender individuals undergoing hormone therapy. In this project, we will investigate the
role of TS in maintaining efficient DNIC, as well as the mechanistic links between dysfunctional DNIC, TMD-like
pain, and TMD-related comorbid pain conditions. Specifically, we hypothesize that the rACC to PAG circuit
mediates sex differences in DNIC efficiency in a TS-dependent manner and that strengthening DNIC effectively
attenuates TMD-related primary and comorbid pain responses. In specific aim (SA) 1, we will determine the role
of the rACC to PAG circuit in DNIC efficiency using a behavioral paradigm and chemogenetics, which will
experimentally manipulate the strength of the circuit with and without anti-androgen treatment in males and with
and without TS treatment in females. In SA2, we will investigate the relationship between DNIC and TMD-like
pain responses. We will conduct a concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess pain-
induced changes in brain networks and confirm that both TS treatment and strengthening the rACC to PAG
circuit rectify the pain-induced changes in the brain networks in male and female rats. In SA3, we will determine
whether chemogenetically activating DNIC leads to a reduction in TMD-related comorbid pain responses and
whether TS treatment further enhances the chemogenetic effects. The project will significantly improve our
knowledge of the impact of sex on CNS pain modulation, which should have broad translational implications for
the development of customized therapeutic strategies for both transgender and cisgender individuals."

SUMMARY. About 14% of US adults have an active alcohol use disorder (AUD) and most never receive treatment. Experts agree primary care should play a major role in identifying AUD and engaging patients in treatment. However, screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) alone has not been found to increase AUD treatment. High-quality patient-centered primary care usually relies on shared decision-making, which can help motivate patients and support them in finding treatments that are aligned with their preferences. While patients likely prefer shared decision-making with their primary care providers, time pressures and other barriers in primary care may limit the reach of shared decision-making in primary care; centralized approaches with systematic outreach could decrease the burden on primary care and have greater reach, but it is unknown whether shared decision-making for AUD will be effective in the absence of an established clinical relationship. SPECIFIC AIMS: The Systematic Implementation of Patient-centered Care for Alcohol Use Trial is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, effectiveness-implementation trial testing two interventions to systematically implement shared decision-making with primary care patients with AUD: a primary care intervention and a centralized intervention. The specific aims of the trial are to test whether each intervention—compared to usual care alone—(1) increases the proportion of primary care patients engaged in AUD treatment over a year follow-up or (2) decreases alcohol use over 2 years follow-up. METHODS: The proposed trial is conducted in 30 primary care clinics in which usual care includes SBIRT. The trial randomizes the 30 clinics to one of three approaches to managing AUD: (1) usual care; (2) a primary care intervention added to usual care that uses state-of-the-art implementation interventions to systematically encourage primary care providers to offer routine shared decision-making for AUD; and (3) a centralized intervention added to usual care that systematically offers outreach and shared decision-making for AUD by a social worker. The trial sample includes 1,500 adult primary care patients who are at high-risk for moderate-severe AUD based on DSM-5 AUD symptoms documented in their medical records. Primary outcomes are: 1) the prevalence of documented AUD treatment engagement during 12 months of follow-up per National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) definitions (2 visits for AUD treatment in the 34 days after initiation), and 2) changes in alcohol use at follow-up screening based on changes in the AUDIT-C score from baseline to follow-up 9-24 months later (irrespective of treatment engagement). Intent to treat analyses include all eligible patients regardless of whether they receive shared decision-making and compare patients in each intervention arm to those in the usual care arm. IMPACT: Over 32 million US adults have active AUD. Many are identified in primary care but few engage in referrals to treatment. This trial will test two practical population-based interventions to increase treatment engagement in patients who report AUD symptoms."

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a preferred treatment for life-threatening diseases and
cancers of the blood. HSCT involves exposing the patient to toxic doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy
diseased cells followed by an infusion of healthy donor cells to rescue the compromised immune system.
Worldwide, more than one million HSCT have been performed and ~8,000 HSCT are performed in the US
each year. However, challenges in identifying matched sibling or unrelated donors means that a large
percentage of patients are unable to find a suitable donor. Recent advances in the prevention of transplant-
related complications have allowed for safe and effective transplants using haploidentical (haplo), or half-
matched donors. These donor-recipient pairs are most often parent to child or child to parent. Mounting
evidence that using haplo donors can produce excellent clinical outcomes has resulted in a 20% increase in
haplo transplantation across a recent 4 year period, and haplo transplantation now comprises >25% of all US
transplants. However, little is known about the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and donation-related
experiences of haplo donors. There is reason to believe that HRQoL in parent-child donation may differ from
that of sibling donation due to the nature of the relationship – particularly when the parent/child recipient has
compromised health status or does not survive. Additionally, little is known about how physicians make the
decision to use a haplo donor versus another source when one is available (e.g., matched unrelated donor), and
there is wide variation in the frequency of haplo donation by transplant center. The ultimate goals of this
project are to examine HRQoL and factors associated with HRQoL among haploidentical donors and to
describe current practice patterns and decision-making about haplo donation among transplant physicians.
Specifically, we will (1) examine HRQoL and donation experiences among haplo donors in a series of 6 focus
groups with adult and adolescent haplo donors to identify themes in their donation-related experiences and
HRQoL, (2) examine HRQoL in a retrospective cohort of adult and adolescent haplo donors who are at one
year post-donation using cross-sectional structured telephone interviews with 350 haplo donors (300 adults
and 50 adolescents aged 13-17), (3) compare haplo donor HRQoL to that of historical comparison groups of
matched unrelated donors and sibling donors, and (4) examine physician decision-making and transplant
center selection patterns in the context of haplo donation via 3 physician focus groups and web-based survey
with ~170 US-based transplant centers. This study is important because parent-child donation has not been
systematically investigated in a nationwide sample and there are reasons to believe that donations between
parents and children may make donors particularly vulnerable. The investigation is also novel because there
have been no other systematic nationwide investigations of haplo donation. This investigation will provide the
foundation for recommendations and guidelines directed toward the selection of and care for haplo donors."

This award will support Dr. Jensen-Battaglia’s long-term goal of developing the expertise and skills needed to
become an independent investigator exploring the overlapping roles of physical function and environment in
health outcomes for older adults with cancer. By 2050, 20% of new cancer diagnoses will be among those age
80 or older, comprising an estimated 6.9 million cases worldwide. The majority of older adults in the United
States (U.S.) prefer to remain in their homes as they age (i.e., ‘age in place’), which is associated with health
benefits. Conversely, both unsupportive neighborhood environment and residential relocation are associated
with increased healthcare utilization, decreased survival, and falls. Although impairments in physical function
are common and highly modifiable, we do not yet know if older adults with cancer are at greater risk for
residential relocation as a result of these impairments compared to those without cancer. Whether negative
health outcomes such as healthcare utilization, mortality, and falls associated with relocation are due to
relocation itself or associated changes in the neighborhood environment remains unclear. Dr. Jensen-Battaglia
will address these gaps in her proposed project by prospectively evaluating the association between
impairments in physical function and residential relocation among community dwelling older adults in the U.S.,
and examining how this association differs for those with cancer compared to those without cancer.
Additionally, she will assess how residential relocation modifies the effect of neighborhood environment on
future health for those with cancer. For the F99 phase, Dr. Jensen-Battaglia will leverage data from a nationally
representative sample of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries [National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS)] to
refine a novel measure of mobility-related physical function, assess whether this is associated with increased
risk of residential relocation, and evaluate if cancer diagnosis positively modifies this relationship. She will also
explore how the relationship between mobility-related physical function and residential relocation differs across
home environments and cancer types. For the K00 phase, she will create a dataset linking the NHATS with
Medicare claims and area-based measures, and evaluate if residential relocation positively modifies the effect
of worsening (compared to stable or improving) neighborhood environment supports on cancer-related health
outcomes. Dr. Jensen-Battaglia has worked closely with her sponsors to develop a training plan which
supports successful completion of the predoctoral research project and smooth transition to a competitive,
cancer-focused postdoctoral placement. This includes training to improve knowledge of the patient cancer care
experience, obtain expertise in analysis of residential relocation dynamics, and identify a postdoctoral mentor.
Together, the proposed research and training plan provide optimal opportunities and structure for Dr. Jensen-
Battaglia to develop new skills and progress toward becoming an independent cancer researcher."

Among the numerous problems plaguing the malaria elimination efforts is the emergence and spread of
drug resistance in P. falciparum. Resistance to artemisinin has led to reduced efficacy of artemisinin
combination therapy (ACTs) and ultimately selection of resistance to the partner drugs (e.g., piperaquine).
Clearly the threat of multi-drug resistant malaria is as important today as it has ever been, with the precious
gains in malaria control threatened by the potential for the spread of P. falciparum strains that are resistant
to all currently available treatment drugs. Resistance to artemisinin is not the only factor responsible for
treatment failures. Even before artemisinin resistance emerged, recrudescent infections were commonly
observed when patients were treated with artemisinin derivatives alone. In some studies, even 5-7 days of
treatment with artesunate alone led to ~10% recrudescent infections. The underlying cause of these
recrudescent infections has been attributed to the unique ability of artemisinin to arrest the growth of ring
stages of P. falciparum. These dormant rings can persist for days to weeks before recovering and growing
normally to cause a recrudescent infection. Our published and preliminary data led us to the hypothesis
that selection of artemisinin resistance is a two-step process in which the initial responses of the parasite
to artemisinin drug pressure is an enhanced dormancy phenotype that confers increased tolerance to drug;
subsequently resistance conferring mutations occur (e.g., K13). In Aim 1 we will overexpress genes in a
novel chromosome 10 copy number variant we identified in independently derived artemisinin-resistant
clones. In Aim 2 will use novel high content imaging assays to quantify enhanced dormancy recovery
phenotypes in artemisinin-resistant versus -susceptible P. falciparum. The results of these studies will
provide evidence for the molecular basis of recovery from artemisinin-induced dormancy and possibly
reveal new mechanisms of resistance to artemisinin."

The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a deep learning analytical framework to integrate
histological traits into systems genetics analysis of complex diseases. Mapping the risk genes for poor health
outcomes is a major focus of biomedical research, and new approaches to improve genetic mapping power can
have a transformative impact on public health. Genetic disease risk manifests through complex interactions
between gene regulation and tissue structure, ultimately influencing organ function. However, quantifying tissue
structure for quantitative genetic mapping has not been widely adopted. This is partly because histological
scoring has traditionally been labor intensive and error prone, and limited to coarse measures (e.g., discrete
categories) that are suboptimal for association testing. In contrast, deep neural networks (DNNs) now routinely
automate laborious image quantification tasks for histopathology, making them an ideal platform for integrating
histology into genetic analysis. Furthermore, unlike human-defined histological scores, DNN readouts enable
objective histological trait discovery as a function of genetic, molecular, and physiological variation. In this
project, histological features will be rigorously and robustly quantified using DNNs and these data will be
integrated into novel multiscale statistical models that will connect genetic, molecular, and histological variation
to physiological outcomes. In particular, novel methods will be developed to integrate histology into three major
classes of systems genetic analysis, i.e., heritable trait inference, causal mediation analysis, and molecular
quantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping. These methods will be developed and validated using a data set of
genetic, histological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological data from a cohort of Diversity Outbred mice
used for the study of age-related kidney disease. By using a model system, complex genetic effects and causal
mediation hypotheses can be directly tested to validate and refine the analytical framework. The specific aims of
this proposal include: Aim 1: Identify maximally heritable histological traits through deep learning on paired
genotypes and histological images. Aim 2: Genetically map histological mediators of complex physiological traits
using deep learning on histological images. Aim 3: Identify causal paths connecting molecular QTLs (mQTLs) to
outcomes through histological mediators. The outcome of this study will be a validated methodological framework
for histological systems genetics that is modular, enabling a wide range of users to incorporate appropriate
computer vision tools into state-of-the-art systems genetics workflows for any complex disease."

therapeutic antibodies including anti-infective antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Effector functions
are triggered by the crosslinking of Fc receptors (FcRs) expressed on cytotoxic leukocyte subsets following
binding to target cells opsonized by multiple antibodies. Recent findings have highlighted the key role of myeloid-
derived cells, on the clearance of opsonized pathogenic cells by ADCP/ADCC. Myeloid-derived effectors,
express multiple Fc𝛾Rs, most relevant being the activating receptors Fc𝛾RI, Fc𝛾RIIa and Fc𝛾RIIIa and the
inhibitory Fc𝛾RIIb. Because multivalent immune complexes (ICs) engage and activate all surface Fc𝛾Rs on
myeloid-derived effectors to various degrees (depending on Fc𝛾R expression, Fc:FcR affinity, immune complex
size and antigen density) the magnitude and kinetics of the ADCP and ADCC processes are determined by the
integrated outcome of the activation of all surface FcRs to various degrees. The central hypothesis to be tested
here is that the quantitative understanding of ADCP and ADCC by myeloid effectors triggered by the ligation of
each individual FcR by taking advantage of bulk assays and high phenotypic content single-cell cytotoxicity
assays together with phosphoproteomic data to map the specific signaling events on myeloid-derived effector
cells, will be essential for providing a sound framework on how to engineer the Fc domain for optimal effector
functions. This work will capitalize on our unique set of aglycosylated engineered Fc domains that bind with
absolute selectivity and dialed-in affinity to each FcR type. In Specific Aim 1 we will exhaustively and
quantitatively map the effector phenotypes (ADCC, ADCP, cytokine release, trogocytosis) performed by human
macrophages and monocytes (as well as by neutrophils and by NK cells for thoroughness) triggered by ligation
of each FcR as a function of affinity, IC target size and antigen density. In Sp. Aim 2 we will use novel high
throughput single cell cytotoxicity assays and on-chip cytometry to determine the precise kinetics of immune
synapse formation and cell killing in ADCC (or engulfment for ADCP) as a function of FcR expression levels on
individual cells and to interrogate key relevant mechanistic aspects central to these processes. In Sp. Aim 3 we
will use phosphoproteomics to: (a) identify and quantitate peptide phosphorylation events triggered by each FcR
and (b) detect unique FcR ligation-induced phosphopeptide signatures that correlate with effector functions
triggered by that receptor."

Inflammation is associated with most brain diseases and is thought to contribute to disease pathology.
Unregulated inflammation can contribute to secondary brain damage and neurodegeneration following traumatic
brain injury (TBI). While the majority of TBI research has focused on the role of central inflammation in TBI
pathophysiology, the contribution of peripheral inflammation is under investigated. A detrimental role for
peripheral inflammation was first demonstrated by Helen Bramlett and colleagues, who reported that
intraperitoneal administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines to TBI animals can result in poor outcome. Previous
studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation can reduce both peripheral inflammation and mortality following
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, a widely used model to study inflammation, sepsis and organ failure.
Subsequent studies have shown that release of acetylcholine from vagus efferents stimulates α7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR) on inflammatory cells, leading to reduced release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines into the circulation. As acetylcholine is rapidly degraded after release, and α7nAChR undergo rapid
desensitization, additional mechanisms may be involved in regulating peripheral inflammation. We examined
the vagus efferents and their cell bodies located in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMN) for the expression
of neuropeptides, which are often co-released with neurotransmitters and have a relatively longer half-lives. We
have found that cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide (CARTp) is expressed at high
levels in DMN neurons. We propose to test the hypothesis that that CARTp acts to regulate peripheral
inflammation and can be used to improve TBI outcome. We will first test this hypothesis by examining the role
of vagus CARTp in TBI-associated inflammation using neutralizing CARTp antibodies and administration of
exogenous CARTp targeted to the spleen. Using CRISPR-Cas, we will delete the Cartpt gene in the DMN, and
will measure the levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines following TBI. We will then test the therapeutic
potential of CARTp as a treatment for TBI by examining its effect on inflammation, blood brain barrier (BBB)
permeability, and inflammatory cell infiltration into the injured brain. Finally, we will examine if post-TBI CARTp
administration can reduce neuronal loss and improve cognitive outcome. Sex as a biological variable will be
assessed. The results from these studies will have implications not only for TBI, as well as for the numerous
other diseases in which inflammation is a contributor."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Epidemiological studies indicate a biphasic
association between alcohol and cardiovascular disease with frequent low-to-moderate consumption being
protective, whereas heavy bingeing and chronic abuse is harmful. Currently lacking, however, is in-depth
mechanistic knowledge of how different levels of alcohol impact arterial cells to ultimately dictate vessel
pathology and disease progression. Most of the problems associated with cardiovascular disease begin with
arteriosclerosis, a thickening and stiffening of the artery wall, that may progress to plaque development and
blood flow blockage resulting in heart attack or stroke. Arteriosclerosis involves medial and intimal hyperplasia
(i.e., intima-media thickening or IMT) due to the accumulation of ‘vascular smooth muscle-like’ a-SMA+ cells.
Emerging evidence suggests that in response to injurious stimuli such as inflammation or disturbed flow,
endothelial cells can transform into different cell types, especially myofibroblasts in a process known as
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and thus contribute to intima-media thickening. Crucially, no
information exists as to whether alcohol consumption, a common modifiable behavior and a known modulator of
cardiovascular disease, might regulate endothelial transformation in this context, a question of considerable
interest and the focus of our proposal. Based on our exciting preliminary data in human arterial cells and in a
mouse model, we will use gain-and-loss of function approaches in vitro and in vivo, in combination with multi-
color ‘Confetti’ reporter lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses to test our hypothesis that
alcohol has a biphasic effect on atherogenic stimuli-induced endothelial phenotypic transformation to
differentially affect vessel homeostasis and arteriosclerosis and to elucidate the involvement of Notch in
mediating these responses. Data generated will markedly increase our basic science understanding of how
drinking affects cardiovascular disease, information that could be leveraged to inform novel treatments for this
leading cause of morbidity and mortality."

Potentially lethal cardiac channelopathies associated with pathogenic variants in the RYR2-encoded
cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2)/calcium release channel (CRC) are the pathogenic basis for
a significant portion of autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death in the young (SUDY). RYR2 gain-
of-function (GOF) pathogenic variants account for 60% of autosomal dominant catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT1), a potentially lethal heritable arrhythmia syndrome that
classically manifests as exercise-induced syncope, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or sudden cardiac
death (SCD). In 2020, we discovered a novel RYR2 loss-of-function (LOF) mechanism that we have
termed calcium release channel deficiency syndrome (CRCDS). We identified a novel homozygous
duplication (RYR2-DUP) involving ~26,000 bp of intergenic sequence, RYR2’s 5’UTR/promoter region,
and exons 1-4 of RYR2 that is responsible for highly penetrant, exertion-related SCA/SCD in the Amish
community without an overt phenotype to suggest RYR2-mediated CPVT1. Unlike typical CPVT1,
individuals homozygous for the RYR2 duplication have displayed typically only intermittently prolonged
QT intervals or prominent U-waves and typically had completely normal exercise/epinephrine stress
tests and normal 24-hour Holter monitoring. Thus, cardiologic tests, such as ECG, stress testing, and
echocardiogram, are currently unable to reliably identify or further risk stratify family members likely to
be homozygous for the RYR2 duplication. Given the potentially lethal nature of these inheritable RYR2-
CRCDS variants and the lack of a robust and measurable clinical phenotype, it is vitally important to
better understand the spectrum and contribution of CRCDS-associated RYR2 variants in SUDY and to
determine the underlying disease-associated mechanisms in patient-specific re-engineered heart cell
models using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Here, we propose to
1) determine the frequency of CRCDS due to RYR2 coding region, non-coding region, and structural
variants (SVs) in SUDY and 2) develop an international registry for CRCDS to identify
genotype/phenotype correlates to assist in clinical diagnosis and management of patients with CRCDS.
3) determine the relative contribution of CRCDS (LOF)-associated RyR2 variants versus CPVT1
(GOF)- variants in SUDY using functional studies, 4) develop a function-based iPSC-CM platform for
RyR2 VUS resolution, and 5) determine the compensatory mechanisms related to loss of RYR2
transcript/RyR2 protein expression and function as it relates to calcium handling components and heart
cell function during early cardiac development."
10934337,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Black people with disabilities (PWD) disproportionately experience poor physical and behavioral health
outcomes due to compounding socioeconomic challenges and stigma-related stressors. Intersectionality theory
suggests that such magnified health inequities may be in part driven by intersectional stigma (i.e., experiences
shaped by both racism and ableism), though few quantitative measures exist to capture this dynamic,
multifaceted construct as it fluctuates over time and across contexts. To address this empirical gap, the
proposed project will develop and validate a brief self-report measure of daily intersectional stigma experiences
for Black PWD via a three-phase, multimethod approach. In Aim 1, we will generate an initial pool of items by
drawing upon available literature, expert input, and feedback from Black PWD. In addition to consulting extant
empirical research on ableism, racism, and their intersection, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with
20 Black PWD community members and 10 content experts. In Aim 2, we will refine this initial item pool by
gathering feedback from Black PWD via an iterative process of cognitive interviewing and pilot testing. We will
conduct an initial round of cognitive interviews with 20 Black PWD, followed by a 7-day pilot daily diary study
and a second round of cognitive interviews with the same participants to further ascertain that the items
adequately capture contextual and temporal variability in intersectional stigma experiences. In Aim 3, we will
psychometrically evaluate the newly developed intersectional stigma measure by examining its scale structure
and predictive validity in relation to stigma-relevant psychosocial outcomes using a probability-based sample of
Black PWD recruited from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel. We will conduct a 2-week daily diary study with 200
Black PWD, who will complete the finalized intersectional stigma measure, along with measures of emotion
regulation difficulties, psychological distress, perceived social support, connection with the disability and Black
communities, and experiences of racism and ableism in isolation. We will examine the prevalence of
intersectional stigma as a function of demographic and disability characteristics; additionally, we will investigate
the concurrent and prospective associations between intersectional stigma and psychological distress, while
also exploring potential mediators and moderators of these associations. Results from this project will provide
a novel measurement tool for use in future observational and intervention research geared towards addressing
the deleterious health impact of intersectional stigma for Black PWD. Findings will also yield valuable insights
into the psychosocial consequences of intersectional stigma among a representative sample of Black PWD
across the U.S., directly addressing NIMHD's priority in understanding the intersectional lived experiences of
PWD from health disparity populations."

Chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most severe manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD)
and is characterized by the presence of ischemic rest pain, with or without gangrene, and often requires limb
amputation. Analysis of CLTI patient muscle specimens has identified fatty fibrosis, the replacement of muscle
with intramuscular fat and fibrotic scar tissue, as a prominent feature. Recent evidence points to ciliary Hedgehog
signaling as a potent anti-adipogenic signal that suppresses the differentiation of fibro-adipogenic progenitors
(FAPs), the cellular origin of fatty fibrosis, into adipocytes. Using pre-clinical rodent studies and translational
experiments in patient tissues and cells, we have uncovered mis-regulated Hedgehog signaling within the CLTI
limb. Preliminary experiments indicate that genetically or pharmacologically altering the Hedgehog pathway in
the ischemic limb modulates fatty fibrosis, perfusion recovery/angiogenesis, and muscle function – indicating
therapeutic potential of this pathway. This proposal will use innovative and powerful mouse models involving
cell-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches to identify and define the cellular and molecular mechanisms
by which intramuscular fat forms within the CLTI microenvironment, and the functional consequences of
intramuscular fat and fibrosis on CLTI limb hemodynamics and function. Success in these studies will provide
mechanistic insight into the impact of fatty fibrosis on PAD/CLTI pathobiology, and would aide in the search for
novel targets for therapeutic development aimed to treat a patient population that currently has few available
options."
10774257,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The etiology of eating disorders (ED) is complex, yet largely unknown, resulting in a profound lack of effective
treatments and a “crisis in care”. Common to EDs are alterations in the motivation to eat, ranging from extreme
food restriction and weight loss, to binge eating coupled with compensatory strategies like self-induced vomiting.
Despite the traditional emphasis on diagnostic differentiation based on these physical symptoms, they often
overlap, and, along with significant diagnostic crossover (e.g., from anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa) over
time, suggest shared features that are not well captured by current diagnostic criteria. Persistence of restricted
eating, binge eating and/or purging despite negative consequences, along with evidence of altered reward and
punishment sensitivity in ED, raise the question of whether a failure to appropriately process and/or learn from
rewarding and/or punishing experiences might contribute to repeated engagement in maladaptive approach and
avoidance behavior and illness maintenance. This is the first study to apply a multi-dimensional framework of
reward processing to ED, by examining how the interplay of RDoC-based Positive Valence measures of `liking'
(i.e., the hedonic impact of reward consumption), `wanting' or incentive salience (i.e., motivation to pursue a
reward), and learning (i.e., the acquisition of reward-outcome contingencies), which are associated with distinct
frontostriatal neurocircuitry, differ across ED subtype and correspond to clinical symptoms at baseline and one
year later. We will study 150 demographically-matched women with ED (50 AN-restricting type (AN-R), 50 AN-
binge eating/purging type (AN-BP), 50 bulimia nervosa (BN)) and 50 healthy controls (HC) aged 18-35. During
fMRI, participants will complete 1) a modified monetary incentive delay (MID) task to assess group differences
in both neural anticipation (`wanting') and receipt (`liking') of rewarding and aversive disorder-specific (taste) and
generalized (money) stimuli (Aim 1), and 2) a probabilistic associative learning task to assess decision-making
and instrumental learning from monetary wins and losses (Aim 2). Aim 3 will examine interactions between
`liking', `wanting' and learning and associations with symptoms at study entry and 1 year later. An Exploratory
Aim will examine associations of dopamine function, as measured by neuromelanin MRI (NM-MRI), with ED
diagnosis and brain response to `liking', `wanting', and learning to further inform mechanistic models of reward
in ED. This study is innovative and significant in several ways: 1) it adopts a multi-dimensional framework of
reward processing to examine independent and interactive contributions of understudied, yet critically important
constructs (e.g., `liking', `wanting', learning) in ED, 2) it assesses the role of stimulus modality (taste, money) and
valence in `liking' and `wanting', and 3) relates these constructs to actual symptoms and behavior at study entry
and 1 year later to understand what drives shared and divergent symptoms and predicts symptom change, which
has potential for substantial clinical impact. Identification of dimensional constructs underlying symptoms and
their neural correlates is critical to improve a mechanistic understanding of ED and advance precision medicine."

This application will build on and enable novel extension of our established program of study (R01AA017347),
""Tracking HIV Infection & Alcohol Abuse CNS Comorbidity with Neuroimaging."" The current proposal seeks
neural substrates that accelerate brain structural and functional age-related declines in people living with HIV
infection (HIV), especially those who meet criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Particular attention is paid
to MRI-visible anomalies of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and non-heme iron deposition that commonly
occur in normal aging and may interact with disease. WHM, markers of edematous tissue potentially marking
demyelination, are more prevalent among older individuals with HIV infection and even greater in those
comorbid with AUD relative to normal aging and may contribute to motor and cognitive deficits. Similarly, non-
heme iron deposition in subcortical and cerebellar dentate nuclei increases with age and may underlie
disturbance in gait and balance. Whether balance stability and cognitive abilities follow parallel or accelerated
aging trajectories in HIV with or without AUD comorbidity and are related to common brain markers remain
unclear. Herein, we propose a longitudinal protocol in using a suite of neuroimaging approaches to identify
mechanisms of local tissue degradation we hypothesize underpin functional declines in postural stability, gait,
and cognition of men and women aging with HIV infection and AUD. Longitudinal study of this population will
determine if the brain and behavior deficits are stable or accelerating, i.e., exhibit an age-disease interaction.
Specific Aim 1: White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, detected with structural MRI using FLuid-
Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) imaging, will be quantified and distinguished as periventricular
(PVWMH) or deep (DWMH) in cortical lobar, brain stem, and arterial regions.
Specific Aim 2: Myelin Integrity and Regional Iron Deposition will be measured with Quantitative
Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Non-heme iron will be quantified as
paramagnetic positive susceptibility in subcortical gray matter structures (globus pallidum, caudate, putamen,
red nucleus, dentate nucleus ). QSM diamagnetic negative susceptibility in combination with DTI will be used to
characterize tissue constituents in white matter tracts and WMH.
Specific Aim 3: Static Postural Stability, Dynamic Gait, and Cognition. Static postural stability will be
measured with a balance platform yielding metrics of sway path length, sway direction, and truncal tremor. Gait
will be video recorded and measured in-house yielding metrics of dynamic gait coherence and stability.
Standardized HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) composite scores will measure component
processes of cognition: executive function, working memory/attention, verbal and visual memory and learning,
and spatial abilities. Impact of WMH volume, regional iron deposition, and myelin disruption will be tested with
our static and dynamic measures of postural stability and with component processes of cognition."

Disparities in health within the U.S. are pervasive and, for some populations, widening. High-quality primary
care plays an important role in the prevention, diagnosis and management of the many chronic health
conditions that contribute to health disparities among older adults. Primary care in the U.S., however, is
threatened. Even before COVID-19, the per-capita supply of primary care physicians was falling and varied
dramatically by county, threatening rural and other less-advantaged communities. Little is known about how
access to high-quality primary care has changed in recent years—including changes in access associated with
the COVID-19 pandemic—or about the policy-, system-, or practice-level factors that are associated with better
quality of primary care for older adults. These gaps in understanding have hindered our ability, as a nation, to
provide the best care to older adults. This project will address this need by drawing on a unique national
dataset that includes annual information on the ownership and staffing of all U.S. primary care practices from
2015–2024, linked Medicare claims data, and surveys of nationally representative samples of these practices
conducted in 2017 and 2022. Work in this project will entail: Aim 1: Examine U.S. trends in access to primary
care for Medicare beneficiaries in traditional Fee-for-Service and Medicare Advantage and determine how
these trends varied for less-advantaged populations. The team will conduct repeated cross-sectional studies of
access to primary and relevant subspecialty care for Medicare enrollees and how trends in access to care
varied for less-advantaged populations. Aim 2: Identify the policy-, system-, and practice-level factors
associated with better processes and outcomes of care for Medicare beneficiaries, with a focus on those with
fewer social and economic advantages. The team will take advantage of the substantial differences across
states, delivery systems, and physician practices in the implementation of initiatives intended to improve and
support primary care to apply differences-in-differences approaches to identify potentially high impact factors.
Aim 3: Conduct qualitative research to deepen our understanding of the underlying barriers and facilitators to
improving primary care for less advantaged populations. Under this aim, the team will conduct key informant
interviews with experts on policy, primary care and the safety net to deepen our understanding of current
challenges and opportunities facing safety net practices. The team will then purposively sample practices that
participated in the 2022 survey that serve economically less-advantaged and minoritized populations and
conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with their leaders and staff. Findings across these three aims will be
triangulated to develop recommendations that can assist practice leaders, health system leaders, and
policymakers in improving primary care and reducing health disparities for older adults."
10758851,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of many autoimmune diseases that disproportionately affects
females. Although many risk factors for lupus are identified: >170 genes including GPR174, myriad
environmental exposures, and aberrant X chromosome inactivation, none of these sufficiently explain the steep
rise in incidence of ADs at the time of puberty in a female-specific manner. Epidemiology suggests a major role
for sex hormones and their receptors in autoimmune diseases. We previously showed that female lupus-prone
mice, expressing only a short form of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα short), have significantly reduced renal
disease and increased survival. Determining the mechanism of this protective effect, which is estrogen
dependent, is the primary goal of this proposal. Of note, ERα-/- (null) lupus prone mice were not similarly
protected. Combined, our data suggest that the presence of the short form of ERα confers protection, not the
absence of full-length ERα. Others and we demonstrated a critical role for ERα in dendritic cell (DC) development
and endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) responsiveness. Interestingly, the ERα expressed in ERα short mice is
similar in structure to an endogenous ERα variant (ERα46) that lacks the same AF-1 domain, and differentially
regulates gene transcription compared to full length ERα. Overexpressing ERα46 in vitro also modulates TLR-
induced responses, relevant to this proposal. In the proposed study, we will further investigate the role of ERα
short variants in modulating TLR7-induced immune responses, and determine whether genomic and/or non-
genomic mechanisms of ERα short variant action are protective. Our overall hypothesis is that increasing
expression of ERα short or ERα46 in immune cells will be anti-inflammatory, and that the ratio of ERα46
to ERα66 is decreased in lupus patients versus healthy controls. We also hypothesize that targeting
immune cells with novel anti-inflammatory selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that alter ERα
membrane signaling and/or ERα-induced transcription will uncouple estrogen-mediated anti-inflammatory
responses from those impacting reproductive tissues. We will test our hypotheses by accomplishing these
Specific Aims: 1) Overexpress ERα short or treat immune cells with novel SERMs (OBHS, PaPE) that select for
anti-inflammatory properties of ERα and determine the effect on known TLR7-induced inflammatory endpoints,
2) Investigate effects of membrane-only ERα signaling vs. nuclear only ERα expression on TLR7-induced
pathways in mice, and 3) Identify ERα variants in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) and B cells
using droplet digital PCR and Iso-Seq technology, to determine whether ERα46 is differentially expressed in
lupus patients vs. controls, potentially explaining a biologic difference in females predisposed to autoimmunity.
These aims will allow us to determine if we can separate ERα's reproductive effects from its potentially modifiable
immune effects as a therapeutic strategy, which if successful, will provide novel approaches to immune
modulation in lupus and other immune mediated diseases, especially those with a significant sex bias."

 Specific aim 1: to investigate the role of Smad1 in regulation of fibroblast phenotype
following MI and to explore the molecular basis for Smad1-mediated anti-fibrotic effects. RNA-

signaling, or interactions with STAT6 and p53 fibrogenic pathways. The role of these mechanisms will
be investigated in vitro and in vivo.
 Specific aim 2: to study the role of macrophage Smad1 in repair and remodeling of the
infarcted heart. Our preliminary data show that macrophage-specific Smad1 perturbs repair of the
infarcted heart by restraining the angiogenic properties of macrophages through downregulation of the
angiogenic chemokine CXCL12. We will explore the mechanisms for the angiogenesis-regulating
actions of macrophage Smad1 in vitro and in vivo.
 Specific aim 3: to investigate the molecular basis for Smad1 vs Smad2/3 activation in

For decades, the mouse has been the premier animal model for studies of human disease, providing
the opportunity to explore experimental questions that are intractable for direct study in humans. As a
result, key insights have been obtained for a variety of clinical conditions. Spurred by advances in
technology and international efforts to systematically knock out all of the protein coding genes in the
genome, the number of genetically engineered mice has expanded rapidly in the past 20 years. The
responsibility for maintenance and distribution of mutant mice was initially placed on individual
investigators, which was a tremendous burden in terms of cost, labor and space. In 1999, the NIH
recognized the need for a resource to protect the investment in mutant mouse strains and ensure open
access to all biomedical researchers and established the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers
(MMRRC). Since 1999, the central goal of the MMRRC-UNC has been to work collectively with

Lead (Pb) poisoning is a persistent health issue in the United States due to legacy contamination from
Pb-based sources such as paint, plumbing, and gasoline. Children are most susceptible to Pb
poisoning, which causes persistent cognitive deficits and low IQ. The specific mechanisms by which Pb
poisoning impacts development are not fully understood, however. Previous research showed that Pb
impacts several thyroid hormone (TH)-related processes, including decreases in expression of TH
distributor proteins (THDPs) in the choroid plexus. This is an important issue because TH is a critical
regulator of brain development; disrupted TH signaling in utero leads to smaller brain size and mental
retardation. The impact of Pb-induced THDP impairment on development has not been fully tested.
Given the impact of Pb on THDP expression, our central hypothesis is that Pb poisoning impairs TH
distribution into the brain and compromises TH-dependent developmental mechanisms. TH regulates
important aspects of brain development in both humans and amphibian, in some surprisingly similar
ways. The overall rationale of this proposal is that TH is the key driver of metamorphosis in frogs, which
makes tadpoles ideally suited to address how Pb dysregulates TH-dependent mechanisms of
development. We will use Xenopus laevis tadpoles to assess the impact of Pb on the expression and
function of THDPs in the choroid plexus and its effects on TH-sensitive cellular and molecular
mechanisms brain development. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To
determine the effects of Pb poisoning on expression of THDPs, TH-sensitive genes, neurogenesis,
neuronal differentiation, and spine maturation using time-lapse in vivo imaging techniques. 2) To test if
knockdown of THDP expression in the choroid plexus mimics the effects of Pb poisoning. 3) To test if
overexpression of THDPs in the choroid plexus can counter the effects of Pb-poisoning on TH-
dependent mechanisms of brain development. The outcomes of this research will test a significantly
understudied mechanism by which Pb is hypothesized to compromise development. These protocols
will serve as a new, unique set of sensitive end points to evaluate not just heavy metals but any chemical
suspected of disrupting THDP expression and function. This proposal is innovative because it uses
advanced techniques that have not been previously used in animals to address the issue of
developmental Pb neurotoxicity. This project is significant because it will conclusively test the degree
to which Pb affects development via dysregulation of TH-signaling and therefore may lead to
alternative/complimentary therapies for counteracting Pb-poisoning in children."

Malaria transmission occurs through the bite of Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles, and
in much of sub-Saharan Africa, transmission of the deadliest Plasmodium falciparum parasites is mediated by
the sibling mosquito species Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii. The best method available to prevent malaria
infection is through long-lasting insecticide impregnated mosquito bed nets (LLINs). Distribution of LLINs has
had a massive impact on the number of malaria cases, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, with epidemiological
modelling predicting that between 2000 and 2015 LLINs were responsible for as much as 68% of the observed
reduction in malaria cases in this period (1). As such, insecticide-based mosquito control represents the
cornerstone of malaria prevention and elimination efforts. Inevitably, however, mass distribution of LLINs has
driven widespread resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Anopheles populations. This issue stresses the need
for new tools to prevent malaria transmission. We recently demonstrated that antimalarials applied to solid
surfaces can kill the mosquito stages of P. falciparum parasites when Anopheles females absorb these
compounds via their legs. From a preliminary in vivo efficacy screen, we have identified two structurally similar
endoquine-like quinolone (ELQ) compounds that very efficiently target different sites (Qo and Qi, which
importantly do not induce cross-resistance) on the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex. These compounds,
ELQ-453 (Qo) and ELQ-613 (Qi), exhibit outstanding performance in our in vivo tarsal contact transmission
blocking assay. Here we propose to build on the structural backbone of these compounds and use an iterative
medicinal chemistry approach to optimize both potency against mosquito stages of parasite development and
efficiency of tarsal uptake. Furthermore, we will determine the activity of compounds after impregnation in bed
net-like polymer fiber textiles that will allow testing for durability, photostability, wash-resistance and other
parameters essential for the development of an antimalarial-coated bed net product destined for use in malaria-
endemic areas. Specifically, we will: Aim 1) Design ELQ compounds with increased anti-parasitic potency by
varying their constituent 3-alkyl side chain and benzenoid substituents. We will also investigate the propensity
of the best-performing compounds to select resistant parasite mutants, and will test transmissibility of these
mutants to mosquitoes; Aim 2) Maximize tarsal availability and mosquito pharmacokinetics of these novel ELQ
compounds by optimizing the design of their prodrug moiety; Aim 3) Develop and validate novel ELQ-
impregnated textiles as a prototype for future bed net products incorporating both insecticide and antimalarial
ingredients. To achieve these goals, we will collaborate with leaders in the fields of ELQ medicinal chemistry
(Mike Riscoe OHSU), and product development and testing (Mike Rubal, SwRI). At the end of this project, we
will have generated and validated an innovative mosquito-targeting control tool to reduce malaria transmission
and limit the impact of insecticide resistance."

Acute pancreatitis (AP) affects 270,000 patients/ year in the USA. Alcoholic AP (AAP) is difficult to diagnose due
to under-reporting and lack of a reliable biomarker, with 5-70% of AP being reported as AAP. Alcohol is not a
good biomarker and is detected in only 20% of AAP cases. Phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth), a membrane
phospholipid rapidly formed in the presence of ethanol, is found in blood cells. PEth reflects alcohol intake but
may be unaffected by AAP associated inflammation. However, fatty acids ethyl esters (FAEEs) found in the fat
and pancreas of alcoholics may be excellent AAP biomarkers since FAEEs increase in AAP without detectable
alcohol. Moreover, serum FAEEs >18 nM (normal <10nM) identify covert AAP among those misdiagnosed as
idiopathic AP. Lastly, FAEEs > 2099nM, may predict severe AAP better than the established criteria. Since
human AP universally has visceral fat necrosis, we HYPOTHESIZE that: FAEEs released from fat necrosis
can diagnose AAP, predict its severity, and may worsen the course of AAP. To test this, Aim 1 will validate
FAEEs as biomarkers for AAP. In aim 1A: we will determine the utility of FAEEs as diagnostic biomarkers of
AAP. While NEFA increase only 2-4-fold during AP; the large FAEE increase early in severe AAP may occur in
patients with elevated blood alcohol and predict AAP severity. Thus, aim 1B will study if FAEEs are prognostic
markers for severe AAP. Aim 2 will Determine FAEE’s in relation to alcohol intake, fatty acid composition, AP
etiology and severity. Aim 2A will determine FAEE’s relation to alcohol intake, fatty acid composition in humans
without AP. Our preliminary studies show FAEE concentrations in the fat of alcoholics without AP are ≈1/10th
those of AAP patients. Therefore, Aim 2B will Determine FAEEs in VFN, their relation to AP etiology and NEFA
composition. To understand if FAEEs make AP severe independent of alcohol and fatty acid generation; Aim 2C
will determine the impact of alcohol and FAEEs on AP severity in mice. since alcohol increases NEFA induced
injury in multiple cell types and also FAEE induced organ failure; Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms by which
alcohol increases NEFA and FAEE mediated injury in AAP. Here we will examine the roles of alcohol mediated
aqueous stability of fatty acids (Aim 3A) and PEth generation (Aim 3B) in severe AAP. For this we will use
physical chemistry methods to study whether alcohol increases stability of the normally hydrophobic NEFA or
FAEE monomers, which have long (12-18 carbon) acyl chains. We will also study whether alcohol, or PEth
generation via phospholipase D2 increase an amphipathic interaction between these acyl chains and cell
membrane phospholipids of pancreatic acini, adipocytes and endothelial cells that re injured during AAP. This is
based on a novel interaction responsible for NEFA (and perhaps FAEE) uptake into cells which causes cell
injury. This uptake that can be followed by novel live imaging methods using coumarin tagged NEFA. Overall,
this proposal explores FAEEs as diagnostic and prognostic markers for alcoholic AP and explains how alcohol-
lipid interactions affect the disease course."

In the United States alone, over 2 million people live with active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, and up to
140,000 new infections occur each year. Since 2013, highly effective direct-acting antiviral therapy has been
available, allowing HCV to be cured with short courses of well-tolerated medications. However, HCV
diagnostics now present the greatest barrier to elimination. The current diagnostic workflow involves two-
stage testing with initial screening for HCV antibodies followed by molecular testing for viral RNA. Therefore, an
accurate, simple, rapid, and affordable molecular test for viral RNA is needed to increase detection of
HCV and important coinfections (such as HIV), eliminate cumbersome two-stage testing, and allow rapid
planning of subsequent care after a single visit. The development of such an economical, rapid HCV
molecular test is the expressed purpose of the NIH Notice of Special Interest (NOT-AI-23-001) to which this
proposal is a response. However, two key barriers exist to low-cost implementation of molecular methods for
RNA viruses: 1) lack of automated stand-alone low-cost RNA extraction and stabilization technologies, and 2)
complicated designs and/or expensive proprietary detection technologies for isothermal methods. Research in
this proposal overcomes these barriers with novel chemistries and bespoke microfluidics to enable minimally
trained healthcare workers to perform on-demand HCV/HIV duplex molecular testing in the clinic. To do so, Aim
1 will adapt and automate RNA Sample Extraction and Stabilization (RNAES) technology for HCV/HIV RNA
extraction from capillary whole blood. Building on newly obtained preliminary results, the current protocol will be
streamlined to extract and store HCV/HIV RNA from plasma, RNAES technology will be adapted for whole blood,
and 3D-printed programmed stand-alone microfluidics will be created to automate RNAES and create a sample-
in, RNA-out device. Along with this, Aim 2 will apply chemical innovations and microfluidics to Transcription-
mediated amplification (TMA) for standalone colorimetric detection of HCV/HIV RNA. Preliminary data shows
that detection can be achieved with a colorimetric readout suitable for low-complexity settings and a simple hand-
mixed microfluidic will create a self-contained readout and avoid potential contamination from adding reagents
post-amplification. In Aim 3, external user testing and a clinical evaluation of the HCV/HIV detection system will
be performed in partnership with an external testing site at Stanford University. Separately, based on the final
RNAES whole blood device and workflow, a prospective study to test capillary blood samples from individuals
with HCV and/or HIV will be carried out. This proposal has been carefully designed to enable rapid scaling and
translatability to the market. Achieving either device from Aim 1 or Aim 2 will represent a significant advance that
can be leveraged to improve HCV testing. Combined, these technologies will have an important positive impact
on RNA virus detection through development of an economical, agile molecular detection system."

Obesity-Induced Inflammatory Mediators Predict Lack of Response in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis
Starting Biological Therapies
There is an unmet need to identify predictive biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with respect to outcome
and response to therapy. Numerous efforts to identify patients who will respond well to specific biologic agents
have begun to yield profiles that might allow more personalized use of these agents, but much more work needs
to be done. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of RA, it seems doubtful that a single cytokine or biomarker
will be sufficient to inform the optimal choice of therapy. Instead, the inclusion of multiple biomarkers into
‘biomarker signatures’ may represent a more fruitful approach for the future of personalized therapeutic
approaches.
While clinical factors predicting disease outcomes are few, prior studies have highlighted strong associations
between body weight and RA outcomes, although the mechanisms behind these associations are not defined.
Obesity-induced inflammatory mediators include both proteins (such as adipokines) and lipids (such as fatty
acid–derived bioactive lipids). Both types of obesity-induced mediators have been hypothesized to predict clinical
responses in patients with RA, either by directly contributing to lack of response by promoting subclinical
inflammation and disease relapse, or by describing metabolic phenotypes that may have prognostic value. Prior
studies from our and other groups have described bioactive lipids disturbances in early stages of RA that are
linked to therapeutic response.
Additional preliminary results on samples from Comparative Effectiveness Registry to Study Therapies
for Arthritis and Inflammatory (CERTAIN) cohort, revealed that distinct bioactive lipid profile (including those in
the prostaglandin, leukotriene, resolvin, and eicosatrienoate pathways) was associated with response to different
biologic therapies (categorized by minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in Clinical Disease Activity Index
(CDAI) at 6 months after treatment initiation). Of interest, one of them, the 15-oxoEDE, which derives from
eicosadienoic acid, a n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that has been associated with obesity and diabetes,
was associated with both lack of response to anti-TNF therapy and obesity in the CERTAIN cohort. Taken
together, our work suggests that obesity-induced inflammatory mediators profiling has the potential to identify
metabolic phenotypes and effectively predict patient response to therapy prior to administration, and has also
the potential to identify metabolic pathways that relate to response to biological therapies with distinct
mechanisms of action."
10779645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Many fundamental aspects of our lives heavily rely on an intact motor system: we need it to explore, to
communicate, to interact with our surroundings. The cerebellum is uniquely involved in reach dysmetria, whereby
the limb oscillates about an end target, resulting in diminished reach precision. Though our ability to make
precise, goal-directed movements is so critical, we still lack a complete understanding of how the brain generates
the appropriate activity to achieve something as simple as reaching for a coffee cup. Fortunately, the cerebellar
circuitry is uniquely organized and well-defined; this lends itself to being a tractable structure for testing
theoretical models of its computational logic in practice with the advent of updated neuroscientific tools.
Two such models that describe how the cerebellar cortex guides endpoint precision in reaching are that it 1)
integrates limb velocity to estimate positional values or that it 2) recodes sensorimotor information into temporally
distinct activity patterns. To investigate the computational logic the cerebellum engages to enable goal-directed
reaching, I will use two-photon calcium imaging to measure activity in early cerebellar cortex during a multi-target
reach task in mice. In Aim 1, I will image granule cell axons and molecular layer interneurons to test the
hypothesis that information about target location and movement goal is relayed to the cerebellar cortex by its
mossy fiber inputs. I will leverage multi-view, high-resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and multi-
photon imaging to identify how location and limb velocity information content is encoded by granule cells. In Aim
2, I will use targeted photoexcitation of mossy fiber inputs to induce motor adaptation to test the hypothesis that
stimulation results in a misrepresentation of sensory estimates in granule cells, which drives errant reaching
behavior, and adaptation to the perturbation is a resultant of a re-mapping of the new information content.
Collectively, these data will distinguish whether the cerebellar cortex computes a control function or temporal
basis set model to guide endpoint precision. By rigorously evaluating behavioral motor motifs in rodent models
and linking these to neuronal activity, we can gain clarity into how discrete actions lead to overall performance
and open up more possibilities to better addressing fundamental questions relating to the neural mechanisms of
motor control and learning."
10775387,"The objective of this project is to develop methodology for energy-based background estimation that can
be applied to clinical data and produce accurate quantitative PET images over challenging imaging
situations such as low collected counts, high multiple scatter, and prompt gamma contamination when
imaging non-standard PET isotopes. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of PET imaging in situations
where current state-of-art scatter estimation techniques are limited in accuracy or perform poorly. In this
proposal, we develop a data driven scatter estimation methodology that makes full use of the annihilation
photon energy information present to estimate scatter. This method is also extended to provide
correction for bias arising from prompt gammas present in data collected form some non-standard PET
isotopes. We implement, optimize, and evaluate this algorithm on measured data from a clinical PET
scanner for standard and non-standard isotopes, and subsequently apply the methodology to organ-
specific scanners (brain and breast).
 The proposed work will be accomplished through the following specific aims: (i) optimization and
evaluation of the EB method for scatter estimation, (ii) application of the EB methodology to dedicated
brain and breast PET scanner geometries, and (iii) extension of the EB methodology to correct for
prompt gamma contamination present in data acquired from non-standard PET isotopes.
 In addition to its advantages over existing scatter estimation methodology in situations with low
collected counts and/or data with higher level of multiple scatter, the proposed technique is expected to
be faster, does not require knowledge of activity distribution outside the imaging field-of-view, and does
not require a transmission or CT image. Successful demonstration of this technique will significantly
impact routine oncologic imaging where heavy patients with increased scatter, reduced counts and
limited imaging field-of-view will be susceptible to reduced quantitative accuracy. In addition, this
technique can also expand the application of quantitative PET/CT in new oncology imaging areas such
as treatment monitoring with low-dose repeat PET scans, imaging with new biomarkers that use low
positron yield radionuclides (e.g. 124I, 86Y, etc.), or acquiring data at high count-rates (as in cardiac
imaging or imaging with 124I or 86Y). Beyond oncology, it will also provide improved quantitation in cardiac
studies (82Rb, 13NH3, or 11C-actetate). Since, the proposed scatter estimation method does not require a
CT image it may have an application in PET/MR imaging as well as clinical studies with some patient
motion – both situations where the CT image is either not available or is compromised leading to errors
in the traditional way of estimating scatter."
10781987,"Project Summary
There is a fundamental gap in understanding the circuit, cellular and synaptic bases by which the brain regulates
and maintains neurobehavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) arousal. This is an important problem
because it not only reduces our ability to treat disorders of arousal, including restoration of consciousness in
comatose individuals, but also impacts treatment and deeper understanding of many neuropsychiatric,
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders that often include severe arousal disruption, including Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s disease. We recently uncovered an especially critical and unexpected role for basal forebrain
GABAergic (BFGABA) neurons in supporting wake and fast cortical rhythms. We further identified that wake-
promoting glutamatergic (Vglut2+) neurons of the supramammillary hypothalamus (SUMVglut2) are a major source
of excitatory input to the BF. The current proposal seeks to extend these findings by defining the molecular,
cellular and synaptic bases by which the subcortical SUMVglut2  BFGABA circuit contributes to arousal and fast
cortical rhythms in behaving animals. Building upon substantive preliminary data, our objective is the next step
in pursuit of that goal, to define and characterize: 1) the cellular and synaptic bases by which the subcortical
SUMVglut2  BFGABA circuit regulates neurobehavioral and EEG arousal, 2) all sources of presynaptic inputs to
SUMVglut2 and BFGABA neurons and confirm functional synaptic connectivity within this subcortical network,
spanning “input”SUMVglut2  BFGABA, and 3) the postsynaptic targets (“outputs”) of the
SUMVglut2→BFGABA”outputs” circuit in the preoptic and lateral hypothalamus that drive arousal. Our long-term
goal is to understand the cellular and synaptic bases by which the subcortical SUMVglut2  BFGABA circuit
regulates behavioral and EEG arousal. The central hypothesis is that the SUMVglut2  BFGABA circuit is both
necessary and sufficient for normal levels of brain arousal. The rationale for the proposed research is that
identifying the cellular and synaptic bases by which the SUMVglut2  BFGABA circuit can modulate arousal levels
is a critical first step towards manipulating them and reducing the dysfunction experienced by individuals with
disorders of arousal. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
aims. The approach is intellectually and technically innovative as it seeks to reveal the mechanistic basis by
which this newly revealed subcortical circuit regulates brain arousal and because it employs a novel combination
of newly developed and validated approaches. The proposed research is significant, as it is expected to vertically
advance and expand understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms by which a recently revealed
subcortical circuit regulates arousal. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of
treatments for patients with arousal-based disorders, including those suffering neuropsychiatric,
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders with severe arousal disruption, particularly those in which BF
dysfunction has been implicated."
10853008,"Glycosylation is an essential biological pathway that involves the post- or co-translational addition of sugar
moieties to proteins. Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs) are rare developmental disorders caused by
inborn errors of metabolism in glycosylation pathways. CDGs lack good treatment options, and this is typically
due to poorly understood mechanisms and difficulty in establishing clinical trials in small patient populations. My
long-term objectives are to determine mechanisms of CDGs and identify new therapeutics for CDG patients.
One example is DPAGT1-CDG - a CDG caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes for the first
enzyme used in N-linked glycosylation. Recently, I identified many modifier genes which can be perturbed to
rescue a model of DPAGT1-CDG, but their mechanisms are not yet known. In Aim 1, I propose to determine the
mechanisms of these modifier genes using human cell culture in order to characterize new therapeutic targets
for this disorder. I will use a DPAGT1-CDG cell model to determine how these rescuing modifier genes affect
patient-related health metrics of proliferation, stress, and their glycoproteome. In Aim 2, to identify new drugs
that can rescue this disorder, I will use an in vivo Drosophila DPAGT1-CDG model to perform a repurposed drug
screen using 1,500+ small molecules (98% FDA/EMA-approved). Using an in vivo model will ensure these drugs
are safe during development, and this repurposed drug screen will help expedite the clinical trial process for new
CDG therapies. In Aim 3, I will characterize a new finding that suggests that genes underlying CDGs (""CDG
genes"") themselves represent an enriched set of modifier genes for treating CDGs. Perturbation of CDGs can
rescue models of DPAGT1-CDG, as well as a model of the most common CDG, PMM2-CDG. I will use RNA
interference to perturb all 150+ CDG genes to identify any that are capable of rescuing both DPAGT1- and
PMM2-CDG human cell models (with the same health metrics as in Aim 1). The discovery of new CDG gene
modifier genes capable of rescuing these models could have the potential to translate into future therapies for
many other CDGs. Finally, in Aim 4, I will synthesize the above Aims to test therapeutic drugs from Aim 2 in
human cell culture models and CDG modifier genes from Aim 3 in Drosophila models. I will use high-throughput
tools in cell culture and in vivo stress markers in Drosophila to determine the mechanisms of these new therapies.
This multi-species approach will ensure a better transition from preclinical models into therapies for patients. In
addition to the above, completion of this proposal will provide me with training to complete my career goals. I will
learn new techniques in cell culture and small molecule screens while also taking formal courses in mentorship
and writing. I have an outstanding mentor, co-mentor, and advisory committee consisting of faculty with expertise
in CDGs, cell culture, drug screening, genetics, and molecular biology. I also have state-of-the-art facilities and
staff at the University of Utah available to me. With my plan, committed faculty members, and excellent institution,
completing this proposal will help me successfully transition to an independent research career."

10895540,"Abstract
Chronic inflammatory pathology represents a major source of damage to the brain observed in
Down’s syndrome (DS). Although the precise etiology of these diseases is often unknown,
excessive leukocyte extravasation is a substantial contributor to the tissue damage/inflammation
and our recent data show a prominent role of the plasma protein, Reelin in this process.
Furthermore, we have now shown that it is possible, using anti-Reelin monoclonal antibodies, to
deplete the plasma of Reelin, which results in a significant reduction of a wide range of vascular
adhesion molecule expression. Thus, in contrast to the current methods of depleting individual
adhesion molecules or immune receptors, our anti-Reelin approach systematically
downregulates all major inflammation-driven adhesion proteins on the vascular endothelium.
The purpose of this proposal is to demonstrate the role of Reelin in DS by 1) validating the
therapeutic potential of mitigating chronic inflammatory milieu with an anti-Reelin antibody in an
DS mouse model and 2) identifying high affinity Reelin antibodies for future therapeutic
development."

(AC) to maximize resources, identify novel directions for the Partnership, and report the progress of Partnership
cores and investigators to institutional leaders and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The PEC maintains
internal and external advisory groups to support strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation of Partnership
activities by assessing the relationships between aims, activities, outputs, and expected outcomes. The two
essential PEC advisory groups are the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee
(PSC). The IAC and PSC work closely together within the PEC to provide guidance and recommendations to
the AC. The PEC establishes Logic Models for each Partnership component and provides continual updating to
reflect the new aims, activities, and evolution of the Partnership. The PEC, in collaboration with the Quantitative

Disparities in health care based on race/ethnicity represent a mutable factor that costs the U.S. government
billions of dollars annually. According to the National Academy of Science Board on Higher Education, Blacks,
Latinos and Native American tribal people together represent approximately 25% of the nation’s populations, yet
they represent only 8% of the total science and engineering PhD recipients. The Florida-California Cancer
Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center, is a collaboration among Florida A&M
University (FAMU, a Historically Black College and University {HBCU}), University of Florida (UF) and University
of Southern California (USC) that will advance cancer research to better meet the needs of Black and Latino
communities. In response to the Comprehensive Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) U54
PAR, the CaRE2 Health Equity Center Research Education Core (REC) is proposed to meet the cancer
research education needs of underrepresented minorities (URM) in Florida and California, especially Blacks and
Latinos. The REC will: (1) support the training of 30 URM post-bac students in a one-year mentored research
and training program (“Postbac-CaRE2”); and (2) provide academic career development, mentorship, and tailored
research training opportunities to increase the competitive research capacity for a total of 90 URM graduate
students, post-doctoral fellows and early-stage investigators and 40 ongoing trainees(CaRE2-Grad+); (3)
Evaluation of CaRE2 Research Education activities. Post-baccalaureate trainees at each partner site will have
a year-long immersion in research, working with multidisciplinary teams to build their knowledge of research and
to promote their academic career paths in cancer-related health disparities. Graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows and ESIs at each site will receive intensive mentoring, academic career development and tailored
research training opportunities to promote their successful attainment of research-related and academic
milestones. Program outcomes of the REC will be monitored with Planning and Evaluation Core support to
develop a robust long-term tracking and evaluation program of the REC activities across the diverse CaRE2
training pipelines. The Administrative Core will use data gathered via assessment activities to implement
program changes as needed to promote the success of the trainees."
10897694,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The U.S. is experiencing a crisis of opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose; in the most recent year, there were
over 100,000 drug-related overdose deaths, 75% of which involved opioids. Current pharmacotherapies for
opioid use disorder (OUD) target mu opioid peptide (MOP) receptors, one of five classes of opioid receptors.
These therapies include the full MOP agonist methadone, the partial MOP agonist buprenorphine, and the MOP
antagonist naltrexone. There are several drawbacks in using these medications to treat OUD, which include the
potential for abuse, development of physical dependence, and risk of overdose, particularly for methadone and
buprenorphine. Buprenorphine and naltrexone also trigger severe withdrawal symptoms. There is thus an urgent
need for an improved therapeutic for the treatment of OUD. Cebranopadol (TRN-228) is a first-in-class synthetic
drug developed for its dual-action mechanism in treating pain, mediated by high affinity and potency for both
MOP and nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP). NOP receptor activation has been associated with reduced
development of tolerance, abuse-related behavior, addiction, and physical dependence. In this UG3/UH3
proposal, Park Therapeutics is developing TRN-228 as a first-in-class dual MOP/NOP agonist that can
be used as a safe and effective treatment for OUD. Preliminary nonclinical and clinical data indicate that
cebranopadol has low potential for abuse and physical dependence and produces milder respiratory depression
compared to pure MOP agonists such as morphine and oxycodone. TRN-228 also decreases morphine, heroin,
and cocaine self-administration in rats and did not induce withdrawal when given to opioid-dependent rats. The
UG3 phase of this proposal will test whether oral TRN-228 is a safe and potentially effective alternative treatment
for OUD, based on the following Specific Aims: 1) determining the effects of TRN-228 on intravenous fentanyl
self-administration and fentanyl-induced respiratory depression in opioid-dependent rats, 2) determining the IV
abuse potential of TRN-228, and 3) assessing the ability of TRN-228 to suppress withdrawal. Upon meeting the
UG3 Go/No-Go milestones, Park will progress to the UH3 phase which will demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy
of TRN-228 in decreasing opioid use with low risk of withdrawal or abuse, which will be accomplished by 4)
determining the effects of TRN-228 on fentanyl-induced respiratory depression in opioid-tolerant participants and
5) evaluating the ability of TRN-228 to block the subjective effects of hydromorphone. These studies will
significantly advance the field by establishing the safety and preliminary efficacy of TRN-228. Successful
completion of these aims will guide future efforts to establish a clinical program for FDA approval."
10929485,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) takes the life of an American approximately every 12 minutes and
disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic patients, who experience higher rates of morbidity
and mortality compared to non-Hispanic white patients. Since the incidence of PDAC is relatively modest, even
among higher risk groups, screening is not feasible. Thus, improvements in outcomes require an improved
understanding of PDAC biology to guide development of effective therapies. Here, the partnering PI’s
complementary expertise in PDAC biology and modeling cellular biophysical properties converge to investigate
mechanisms of PDAC cell migration and metastasis, the primary cause of death in this patient population.
The Lowy laboratory focused on identifying therapeutic targets by performing unbiased discovery in PDAC vs.
normal pancreas. They hypothesized that super enhancer associated genes, which define cell identity, would
be effective therapeutic targets for PDAC. One differentially acetylated enhancer region was mapped to the
MICAL2 gene, that encodes a flavin monooxygenase. This protein drives F-actin depolymerization, that in the
cytosol can restructure the actin myosin machinery used to migrate and respond to external mechanical and
biochemical signals. MICAL2 also plays a role in linking nuclear actin dynamics to serum response factor
(SRF) transcription. Myocardin-related transcription factors (MTRFs) are co-activators of SRF; when nuclear
actin depolymerization is induced by MICAL2, globular actin is targeted for nuclear export, freeing MTRF to
bind SRF and activate transcription of genes important for cell adhesion and migration. Studies in PDAC cells
reveal that silencing MICAL2 expression impairs cell migration and metastasis.
The Katira laboratory in collaboration with Dr. Engler’s group have reported that cell adhesiveness serves as a
biophysical marker for metastatic potential, and both adhesiveness and contractility enable adurotaxis, the
ability of cells to migrate regardless of a stiffness gradient. To goal of this project is to define how MICAL2
influences properties of adhesiveness and durotaxis, and how it may regulate properties, not only of the cancer
cell, but of the tumor microenvironment through regulation of gene expression. We hypothesize that MICAL2
promotes PDAC cell invasion and metastasis by cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous
mechanisms. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims; 1) Determine how MICAL2 modulates
adherence and durotaxis in pancreatic cancer cells, 2) Determine how MICAL2 promotes pancreatic cancer
cell migration and metastasis, and 3) Determine how MICAL2 related signaling from cancer an stromal cells
modulates the tumor microenvironment. As a putative therapeutic target, our goal is to determine how MICAL2
functionally regulates cell migration and metastatic capacity during PDAC progression. This knowledge will be
key to understanding how and when MICAL2 activity can be targeted in PDAC."

The goal of the Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Research Education
(RE) Core is to provide critical educational and career development opportunities to current and future
underrepresented cancer scientists and professionals. The RE Core will build upon its achievements to
support students at three important inflection points in the cancer education pipeline: in Aim 1, CREATE
Undergraduate Scholars will be paired with world-class cancer disparities researchers and clinicians, and
complete a summer research and education program, coupled with follow-up research during the academic
year. Scholars will be supported and mentored in their applications to graduate and professional schools, to
further their development as cancer disparities scholars. Undergraduates will benefit from near-peer
mentoring by CREATE Medical Student Scholars, who in Aim 2 will carry out cancer disparities research
and participate during their first year of medical school in a newly-developed elective focused upon the
social determinants of cancer health. In Aim 3, CREATE Graduate Scholars, recruited as underrepresented
second-year PhD students working in cancer research laboratories, will be supported to assure their
retention and success in their PhD programs. Graduate Scholars will receive research and financial support,
will gain expertise in fellowship grant preparation and submission, and will receive education in cultural
awareness to enable successful participation in a diverse scientific workforce. These activities will directly
and positively increase the number of individuals engaged in cancer disparities research, promote retention
in their selected degree programs, and will ultimately increase the participation of underrepresented
minorities in this critical research area. The RE Core will be co-led by an established team of investigators
who have significant experience in leading NIH-supported educational programs. Co-leads Drs. Richard
Cripps (SDSU) and James Murphy (UCSD) and will work with Drs. Ricardo Zayas (SDSU) and Dennis
Trinidad (UCSD) to develop new activities and direct Core progress. The CREATE Partnership’s Internal
Advisory Committee will oversee operations, and RE Core personnel will collaborate with the Planning and
Evaluation Core to assess the effectiveness of each aim and to guide program improvement. The
opportunities offered through the RE Core will engage and support the development of students from racial
and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. The education that will be provided
in cancer-related research will guide participants towards successful careers in this area and enable them to
develop research programs focused upon cancer disparities."
10765659,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunologically, the enigma of the granuloma is best reflected in that sterile, bacillus-controlling, and
progressive granulomas can coexist in the same lung, with the progressive form ultimately killing the host. This
observation is consistent with the modern concept of “concomitant immunity: the paradoxical immune status in
which resistance to reinfection coincides with the persistence of the original infection”. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that the development of concomitant immunity regulates macrophage differentiation, influencing
granuloma formation and ultimately the outcome of the battle between the immune response and the pathogen
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To do so, we will use single cell RNA sequencing and spatial sequencing to map
the coordinates of cell populations and antimicrobial mediators in human TB granulomas. We propose the
following specific aims: 1) elucidate the cellular and molecular architecture of human pulmonary TB
granulomas, 2) investigate the role of macrophage subpopulations that contribute to the antimicrobial response
vs. pathogenesis of TB granulomas; and 3) investigate the role of T cell subpopulations in contributing to
concomitant immunity in TB granulomas. We will identify specific cell subpopulations that contribute to host
defense by comparing individual TB granulomas with varying bacterial loads and those with pathogenesis by
examining the dynamic change with the progression of primary lesions, to early lesions with bronchial
obstruction, to post-primary granulomas. We will determine the role of macrophage subpopulations in host
defense and pathogenesis, in particular the foamy macrophages that we discovered express TREM2. We will
investigate which T cell populations are predictors of individuals that respond to chemotherapy versus those
that are resistant and therefore serve as biomarkers. These studies will bring together collaborators at UCLA,
the Ragon Institute and the Institut Pasteur de Tunis with expertise in clinical tuberculosis, immunology and
molecular biology to gain new insight into the mechanisms by which concomitant immunity influences
granuloma structure to optimize host defense against TB."

10777573,"Late onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by memory loss and
a progressive decline in cognitive function. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-
AD) program has supported systems biology analyses, with VGF (non-acronymic), a neurotrophin-inducible
protein and neuropeptide precursor, being one of the top ranked AD drivers (regulators) identified by several
groups. Notably, biomarker studies have consistently identified reduced VGF levels in the brains and CSF of
patients with AD, and have further demonstrated that VGF is also a strong candidate biomarker of AD
progression. Our recent published data demonstrate that VGF overexpression in hippocampus or chronic
intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of the VGF-derived neuropeptides TLQP-21 or TLQP-62 (named by the N-
terminal 4 amino acids and length) reduces cortical and hippocampal amyloid deposition, microgliosis, and/or
astrogliosis, in a regionally-specific manner, and reduces cognitive impairment in the 5xFAD mouse amyloidosis
model. TLQP-21 activates the complement C3aR1 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), also implicated in AD
pathogenesis and expressed in the CNS on neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, while the antidepressant and
procognitive functions of TLQP-62 are dependent on BDNF/TrkB signaling. In this RO1 proposal, we request
support for preclinical studies that will optimize intranasal (IN) nose-to-brain therapeutic delivery of the VGF-
derived peptides TLQP-21 and TLQP-62 to mice, and will determine their efficacy in the 5xFAD mouse model of
amyloidosis and then subsequently in the PS19 tauopathy model to reduce neuropathology and the progression
of AD-like phenotypes. Our preliminary imaging data indicates that intranasal administration of Cy5-TLQP-21
and Cy5-TLQP-62 results in significant, rapid brain uptake. Aim 1 will determine regional uptake in the brain and
any systemic spillover of IN Cy5-conjugated peptides, using small animal imaging and western analysis of brain
and peripheral tissues. Aim 2 will verify retention of intact peptide in brain using Cy5- and biotin-conjugated
peptide quantification by western analysis, and will determine ‘target engagement’ in hippocampus and cerebral
cortex by IN peptide, including BDNF/TrkB/CREB and c-fos activation. Interim milestones include identification
of the optimal dose and dosing interval for IN peptide delivery based on quantification of regional peptide levels
in the brain, and the determination that signaling pathways known to be regulated by intra-hippocampal or icv
delivery of these peptides are activated by IN peptide. Aim 3 will utilize the most efficacious IN delivery schedule
identified to determine whether cognitive impairment and neuropathology in 5xFAD and PS19 can be reduced.
Lastly, longevity of intranasal peptide treatment effects will be tested, systemic toxicity will be assessed, peptide
modification(s) will be considered, and behavioral, biochemical, histological and large-scale genetics approaches
will be employed to measure relative peptide efficacy in reducing disease progression. These preclinical studies
will provide a firm foundation for future intervention using intranasal delivery of VGF peptide therapeutics in AD."
10777678,"ABSTRACT
The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii provides a model for studying structure-function relationships of
conserved features of the phylum Apicomplexa. Several apicomplexan parasites are responsible for severe
human diseases that persist despite efforts to control them. One limitation is that we lack fundamental
understanding of essential parasite processes that could be used to develop new and/or improved therapies.
Our work is motivated by the goal of understanding the unique complexity of structural features that form the
cytoskeleton of apicomplexan parasites. Among the conserved features is the apical complex consisting of
specialized tubulin rich cytoskeletal structure called the conoid, which provides a platform for other motor
proteins and conduit for protein secretion. Toxoplasma has one of the most elaborate conoid structures, and
while it is reduced in complexity in other apicomplexans, many of the core proteins are conserved. In T. gondii,
the apical complex consists of several preconoidal rings, a prominent conoid made up of specialized
microtubular conoidal fibers, two long intraconoidal microtubules, and the base formed by the apical polar ring.
To date, only a few proteins have been studied functionally, although it is anticipated that conoid is comprised
of ~100 proteins. Progress has been limited by the laborious process of identifying and functionally
characterizing proteins in conoid, most of which have no orthologs in model systems. The proposed project
aims to elevate the state of knowledge of the composition and function of the conoid by identifying all of the
major proteins and localizing them in a composite 3-D structure of the organelle. This goal will be achieved
through cell fractionation, quantitative mass spectrometry, and high-resolution single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM). We will also functionally characterize a number of new conoid proteins to define their
roles in conoid assembly and function. These findings are expected to provide a near-complete atomic model
of all the major components of the conoid, define the role of essential components in its assembly and function,
and provide a framework for comparative studies of other apicomplexans."
10756107,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The goal of the K-award is to position the candidate on the pathway to independent research study. Although
the applicant has some training in dissemination and implementation science, which provided preliminary data
for her current proposal, the applicant needs to acquire higher level implementation methodology training to
propel her towards career independence. The applicant’s goal is to optimize care for critically ill patients through
implementation and deimplementation approaches that achieve systematic absorption of evidence-based
innovations. There are several areas of critical care medicine in need of implementation principles to close the
evidence-to-practice gap that exist. For example, there are millions of critically ill patients annually who require
imaging confirmation after central venous catheter insertion. Emerging literature demonstrates that ultrasound
is a faster alternative to historical chest xray, thus serving as the ideal confirmation for catheter use. When able
to confirm catheter position, ultrasound decreases the number of unnecessary chest radiographs, cumulative
resources (technologist, radiologist, equipment), and patient care delays. However, providers are not adopting
this practice. During the candidates previous 2-year K award, she developed and initiated a successful evidence-
based deimplementation program for ultrasound in lieu of chest xray called DRAUP in the Emergency
Department. We hypothesize that this deimplementation program, developed from a theory-driven model and
guided by the Behavioral Change Wheel framework addresses the foundational constructs of behavior thus
should be successful in any environment. In this K01 proposal, the applicant seeks to demonstrate the
generalizability of the theory-driven constructs of DRAUP by refining, testing, and determining the mechanism
of impact in a new environment. Thus, the applicant proposes a research agenda that aligns with the NHLBI’s
strategic vision objection #6 for studies that “optimize clinical and implementation research to improve health
and reduce disease.” In Aim 1, the applicant will employ a systematic approach to DRAUP component refinement
dosed to the unique context of the Intensive Care Unit. In Aim 2, the applicant seeks to examine effectiveness
outcomes and importantly for de-implementation – cost effectiveness of the program. In Aim 3, the applicant
seeks to use mixed methods to evaluate the mechanism of impact of the refined program in the new environment.
These aims support the applicant’s training plan in which she will receive expert mentorship and training in
Intervention Mapping (Training Goal 1); cost effectiveness analysis (Training Goal 2); and mix methods for
mechanistic exploration (Training Goal 3) from Drs. Elvin Geng, Richard Griffey, Aimee James, and Derek
Brown. Expertise of the mentorship team, along with the academic and training environment of Washington
University, will ensure the applicant’s success. Results of this study will be used to support the scientific premise
of the deimplementation program, which can be tested in a subsequent multicenter larger trial and transferrable
to other critical care medicine evidence-to-practice gaps."
10774708,"SUMMARY: Identifying effective vaccines and their correlates of protection (COPs) for highly lethal human
(Hu) pathogens is problematic. Tularemia (rabbit fever), a severe zoonoses caused by Francisella tularensis
(Ft), is a prime example. Studies conducted in the 1960s revealed that Hu vaccination with the attenuated Live
Vaccine Strain (LVS) of Ft provided partial protection against low-dose aerosol challenge with virulent Ft
SchuS4 (S4); however, protection against higher challenge doses (~2,000 CFU) was subpar and no surrogate
markers of Hu protection were developed. Since the 1960s, no further Hu vaccine-efficacy trials have been
performed and the bulk of tularemia vaccine research has relied on inbred rodent models. Currently, there are
two unmet needs: i) vaccines that protect against high-dose aerosol challenge with S4 and ii) Hu-relevant
COPs to guide future clinical trials as envisioned by the FDA Animal Rule. To advance vaccine candidates
and their COPs, studies are needed in higher outbred models that faithfully replicate Hu responses.
 We used murine and rabbit (Rb) models to identify 2 lead vaccine candidates (S4ΔaroD and S4Δ guaBA)
that were effective against aerosols of WT S4 (target dose ~2,000 CFU). Our two strains along with WT LVS
and an externally developed mutant (S4clpB) were all found to provide various degrees of vaccine-mediated
protection. However, S4aroD was the only vaccine that provided significantly greater protection than
LVS. The S4aroD-mediated protection was robust (75%) up to challenge doses of ~20,000 CFU. During
these experiments, we also collected pre-challenge sera from individual Rbs. Following challenge outcome,
retrospective analysis of these sera identified putative COPs that predict S4 challenge outcome with
statistical significance. Our long-term goal is to foster advancement of the most effective Ft vaccine
candidate to Hu clinical trials. Our immediate objectives are to determine how well the S4aroD-mediated
protection and COPs observed in Rbs translate to non-human primates (NHP). We have formulated the
following Aims: Aim 1. Vaccine efficacy in the NHP model and Aim 2. Correlate analysis of NHP samples.
To further Hu translation, we have secured an invaluable resource: ~150 plasma from LVS-vaccinated Hu
banked prior to the pause in the US Army’s Special Immunization Program.
 The combined bacteriology, vaccinology, aerobiology and biostatistics expertise within this consortium
makes us exclusively well-positioned to complete these studies; our productivity in the prior cycle (>20
publications) documents our ability to achieve our goals. By the end of these studies, we will have determined
the efficacy of S4aroD-vaccination against S4 aerosol challenge regarding both NHP mortality and morbidity.
We will have performed a head-to-head comparison with LVS vaccination and determined if COPs developed
in Rbs are also predictive in NHPs. We envision that pivotal vaccine efficacy and correlate data developed in
the NHP model will place S4ΔaroD on the cusp of translation to advanced development and Hu-clinical trials."
10774802,"Summary
Inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex show rapid plasticity of intrinsic excitability in response to sensory
experience and learning. The molecular mechanisms and functions of such plasticity, and its potential role in
disease, are poorly understood. We study this in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), where brief sensory
deprivation drives a rapid reduction in parvalbumin (PV) interneuron intrinsic excitability, which acts to
stabilize pyramidal cell firing rates. We recently found similar plasticity in somatostatin (SST) interneurons,
suggesting that rapid intrinsic plasticity is a common property of MGE-derived interneurons. Here, we
characterize the mechanisms for intrinsic plasticity in interneurons, and test the novel hypothesis that deficits
in this process play a major role in inhibitory circuit dysfunction in autism.
 In Aim 1, we identify the molecular signaling pathways that mediate intrinsic plasticity in PV neurons
induced by brief sensory deprivation. Prior work shows that deprivation rapidly increases Kv1 potassium
currents, which elevates PV spike threshold. We will identify the molecular pathways for this plasticity, using
a combination of immunohistochemistry and qHCR-FISH to detect alterations in protein and gene expression,
and pharmacological and genetic tools to test causal involvement of candidate signaling pathways. We focus
on candidate pathways that are known to regulate Kv1.1 channels. We also use single-nucleus RNAseq for
unbiased discovery of regulated genes. Preliminary results implicate the Er81-KCNA1 pathway, which drives
increased expression of Kv1.1. This work will yield molecular understanding and molecular markers of PV
intrinsic plasticity, which we will use to characterize its prevalence and properties.
 Aim 2 tests the novel hypothesis that deficits in PV intrinsic plasticity are the underlying cause of PV
circuit dysfunction in some genetic forms of autism, specifically for autism genes that regulate activity-
dependent gene expression and/or Kv1.1 function in PV cells. We propose that due to loss of PV intrinsic
plasticity, neural coding is destabilized in autism. We will test this hypothesis in Fmr1, Tsc2, and Cntnap2
transgenic mouse models of autism. As part of this work, we will test whether restoring gene expression
selectively in PV cells rescues PV intrinsic plasticity and stabilizes pyramidal cell coding. If so, this would
suggest a new therapeutic approach to autism in restoration of PV intrinsic excitability.
 Aim 3 tests for plasticity in SST circuits, which is little studied. In preliminary data, deprivation alters
SST intrinsic excitability and other aspects of SST circuit function. This demonstrates that SST plasticity
exists. We will characterize SST circuit plasticity and identify molecular mechanisms for SST intrinsic
plasticity, to test for possible common mechanisms with PV intrinsic plasticity. Together, this grant will
develop and test the novel hypothesis that plasticity of intrinsic excitability is a major form of plasticity in PV
and SST interneurons that plays important roles in regulating cortical function and disease."

vasculature
Project summary
 Cardiovascular disease associated with myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Adult cardiac muscle is thought to lack the ability to repair and regenerate after MI. Additionally, the
death of cardiomyocytes stemming from MI activates an irreversible cascade of events leading to heart failure.
Stem cell technologies, biomaterials, and various bioengineering approaches have been used to develop
functional human-engineered tissue, which ultimately can serve to revolutionize the treatment of the damaged
heart. The heart is a complicated, multicellular tissue with hierarchical, structural, and multifunctional
characteristics. As such, this tissue presents a huge challenge to replicate through traditional tissue engineering
approaches. Based on an anatomical and physiological understanding of cardiac tissue, one crucial challenge
in cardiac tissue engineering is replicating the complex architecture (anisotropic myocardial fibers and geometric
vasculature) within a cardiac tissue construct and improving its functional maturation. Thus, the objective of
this project is to develop a novel advanced dual 3D bioprinting platform and multiple biomechanical
stimulation strategies for engineering a novel thick, functional myocardial tissue with anisotropic
myocardial fibers and geometric vasculature. Three specific aims of this project are: (1) to fabricate
anisotropic myocardial constructs with geometric vasculature via dual 3D bioprinting, (2) to conduct a systemic
investigation of hemodynamic behaviors and cell responses for the vascularized myocardial construct under
rhythmic mechanical stimulation, and (3) to perform a functional evaluation with an in vivo pig MI model. We
expect that innovatively integrating a dual 3D bioprinting platform with biomechanical stimulation will create a
functional cardiac tissue with myocardial beating and mature microcirculation for MI treatment. If successful, it
will contribute to the prevention of post-infarction ventricular remodeling and the restoration of normal cardiac
function. Furthermore, it will not only help patients who are suffering from extensive physical and emotional pain
to fight and win the battle against heart failure, but will revolutionize current bioengineering research, leading to
a long-term solution for advanced clinical therapeutics."
10776166,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although smallpox was formally declared to have been eradicated in 1980, molluscum contagiosum is
widespread and a variety of zoonotic poxviruses continually infect and adapt to humans. This is exemplified by
monkeypox/Mpox virus, which causes outbreaks in humans with increasing frequency and resulted in a global
outbreak and declaration of a new WHO poxvirus emergency in 2022. Yet several other poxviridae family
members are used as vaccine vectors and oncolytics. Beyond their direct medical significance, studies of
poxviruses have a long history of providing new insights into fundamental aspects of cell biology and
immunology, due in part to their unusual replication cycle and complex immune evasion strategies. Other than
the singular, related African Swine Fever Virus, poxviruses are the only mammalian DNA viruses that replicate
entirely in the cytoplasm. To do this, poxviruses encode their own fully functional DNA replication, transcription
and mRNA biogenesis machinery, forming large cytoplasmic replication sites called “viral factories”. Despite
this, poxviruses remain dependent upon their host cell’s mRNA translation machinery and metabolic pathways
to complete their replication cycle, while their mode of replication makes them highly vulnerable to cytosolic
sensors aimed at detecting their presence and mounting antiviral responses. These metabolic and sensing
processes are intertwined yet how poxviruses control them is both complex and poorly understood. Through
co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry-based screening in biologically relevant primary cells, we
discovered that a highly conserved poxvirus protein, called F17, targets the central metabolic sensor and
effector kinase, mammalian/mechanistic Target of Rapamycyin (mTOR) in unique ways. Unlike other viruses
that target upstream signaling to mTOR to indirectly stimulate or repress its activity, we find that F17 directly
targets the two distinct mTOR Complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1, mTORC2) to “dysregulate” their activity. This is
achieved through F17 binding to unique N-terminal conserved domains in the mTOR regulatory subunits,
Raptor and Rictor, resulting in their competitive sequestration from binding to mTOR. Moreover, we find that
F17 is required to block Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) responses that are initiated by the cytosolic sensor,
cGAS. While the precise nature of these host responses and how F17 counteracts them remains unclear,
additional preliminary data suggests that while other viral proteins function to counteract cGAS-mediated
responses to viral DNA, F17 instead blocks cGAS-mediated responses that are driven by mitochondrial DNA
release, and which require mTOR-mediated metabolic rewiring to drive ISG production. This proposal will
determine the structural basis of mTOR dysregulation by F17, how this contributes to virus replication and
spread in various biologically relevant human cell types, and how F17 counteracts mitochondrial-driven
antiviral responses. Upon completion, this proposal will illuminate previously unrecognized aspects of innate
responses and viral countermeasures that occur during poxvirus infection."
10776253,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulse oximeters are used in nearly every pediatric hospitalization to non-invasively monitor arterial blood
oxygen saturation. Pulse oximetry data are essential to clinical decision-making, informing decisions from the
use of supplemental oxygen to hospital admission to transfer to intensive care. Research indicates that pulse
oximeters may overestimate arterial oxygen saturation in hypoxemic patients with dark skin colors more than in
those with light skin colors. Prior studies have been limited by availability of data and use subjective skin color
measurement methods. In some studies, self-identified Black race has been associated with diminished pulse
oximeter accuracy, without measuring skin color at all. The majority of existing studies were conducted in
adults; however, characteristics of children's skin, such as skin thickness and melanin concentration, may
contribute to different results in children. The overall objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive
understanding of the relationship between skin color and pulse oximeter accuracy in children in the clinical
setting. The results may inform recommendations for clinicians as well as policies and action from industry and
the Food and Drug Administration. This multisite, prospective, observational study will be conducted in a
population of children under 18 years old who are undergoing cardiac catheterization. Children undergoing
cardiac catheterization are a unique population in which to study pulse oximeter accuracy because they have a
wide range of baseline arterial oxygen saturations secondary to their cardiac conditions, allowing for evaluation
of pulse oximeter accuracy across a range of arterial oxygen saturations. Children undergoing cardiac
catheterization are continuously monitored with pulse oximeters and also have direct measurement of arterial
blood oxygen as part of routine care. Data will be collected directly from participants and extracted from their
medical record. Skin color will be objectively measured using colorimetry. The specific aims of the study are
twofold; first, to quantify pulse oximeter accuracy in children with varying skin colors and second, to explore the
mechanistic link between self-identified race and pulse oximeter accuracy. The second aim will assess whether
skin color mediates the relationship between race and pulse oximeter accuracy that was demonstrated in
earlier studies. The results of this study will contribute much needed knowledge about pulse oximeter accuracy
in children of varying skin colors to on-going efforts to reduce disparities and inequities in healthcare."
10744205,"Phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype,
plays a causal role in many human occlusive vascular diseases. To better understand key biological events
occurring in human vascular diseases, we analyzed proteomic data from human atherosclerotic plaques and
genomic data associated with human coronary artery disease. This unbiased analysis revealed that many genes
involved in vesicle trafficking/fusion are over-represented. Previous studies have shown that the lipid kinase
PIK3C3 is an essential regulator of vesicle trafficking/fusion. However, its functional role in VSMCs remains
completely unknown. To examine the role of PIK3C3 in VSMCs, we generated inducible SM-specific Pik3c3
knockout (iSM KO) mice driven by Myh11-CreERT2 transgene. Unexpectedly, Pik3c3 iSM KO mice exhibited
lethality 4 weeks after deletion of Pik3c3, due to a pseudo-obstructive intestine resulting from deletion of Pik3c3
in visceral SMCs in addition to VSMCs. The iSM Pik3c3 KO mice also exhibit dramatic remodeling of the vascular
wall including thickening, aneurysmal dilation and spontaneous neointima. Proteomic analysis and bulk RNA-
seq of Pik3c3-deficient aorta revealed loss of contractile proteins while increased expression of inflammation
genes and targets of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway which has been shown to be critical for VSMC development and
phenotypic modulation. Single cell RNA-seq revealed that Pik3c3-deficient aortic VSMCs almost completely lose
their identity of contractile VSMCs while acquiring markers of inflammatory cells and mesenchymal stem cells.
These exciting data suggest a previously undocumented role for PIK3C3 in maintaining SMC identity.
Mechanistically, Pik3c3 inactivation induced YAP1 protein expression and silencing Yap1 largely restored a
contractile phenotype in Pik3c3-deficient VSMCs. We hypothesize that PIK3C3 is a “master” regulator of the
contractile phenotype of VSMC via regulating autophagosome-mediated degradation of YAP1. Three specific
aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. To circumvent the early lethal visceral phenotype seen with Myh11-
CreERT2 transgene, in Aim 1 we will employ a novel vascular-specific inducible Itga8-CreERT2 mouse to generate
VSMC-specific Pik3c3 KO mice. Atherosclerosis will be induced using PCSK9 AAV and the effects of VSM-
specific deletion of Pik3c3 on lesion formation will be evaluated. Wire injury-induced neointimal formation will be
assessed as well by using this novel KO mouse model. Aim 2 will test that YAP1 is a critical mediator conferring
the effects of Pik3c3 deficiency on VSMCs. YAP1 will be pharmacologically and genetically inactivated, and its
effect on vascular remodeling and gene expression will be determined. Aim 3 will test that YAP1 protein
accumulation induced by Pik3c3 deficiency is due to the impaired autophagic flux that attenuates autolysosome-
mediated YAP1 degradation. Proposed studies will determine the role of PIK3C3 in autophagic flux in vivo and
the role of ubiquitin and p62/SQSTM1 in PIK3C3-mediated degradation of YAP1 in human VSMCs in vitro.
Completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the mechanism of controlling VSMC phenotype."
10744206,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vestibular disorders affect as many as 35% of adults past age 40. Studies of the vestibular inner ear have
yielded important insights into how we process and compensate for head motion including the existence of
parallel channels of information in the afferent nerve. In macular organs, for example, two populations of hair
cells adopt opposite planar orientations of their hair bundles and thus opposite responses to head movements.
This highly conserved bidirectional organization was first described in neuromasts, the lateral line organs
sensing water movements in fish, but the genetic program implementing this reversal during development is
only starting to be deciphered. Consequently, ablation studies to reveal the importance of reversal for
vestibular function have not been possible until recently. Here we propose to address this question by
investigating the consequences of inactivating an orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCRx), implicated by
our preliminary data in orientation reversal in mouse hair cell epithelia. Based on our preliminary data, we
suggest that mouse GPCRx functions downstream of the transcription factor EMX2 and upstream of the
heterotrimeric G protein Gi to reverse a ground state of polarity established by planar cell polarity proteins.
We will test this hypothesis and also use the GPCRx mutant as an animal model to pinpoint how polarity
reversal shapes macular organ responses and downstream effects on vestibular behaviors. To reach these
goals, we will: 1) Use genetics to determine how GPCRx instructs reversal at the molecular level, solving its
epistatic relationship to EMX2, Gi and planar cell polarity proteins in mice, and use zebrafish to test whether
GPCRx-Gi is a conserved effector pathway for reversal. 2) Use molecular markers, electrophysiology and
calcium imaging to resolve hair cell maturation and function in absence of polarity reversal. 3) Determine how
polarity reversal affects afferents' organization and function, with afferent recordings, as well as overall
vestibular function using behavioral tests. Our coherent body of preliminary evidence ensures the feasibility
and the high interest of the project, and our focus on a virtually unstudied receptor protein guarantees
innovation. The multi-PI team is ideally suited to address complementary questions in both the mouse and
zebrafish acoustico-lateralis systems. We anticipate that this collaborative effort will be decisive towards
solving the mechanism of hair cell orientation reversal, its conservation across vertebrates and its significance
for mammalian vestibular physiology. Thorough understanding of polarity reversal will help interpret and design
treatments for vestibular dysfunctions."

 Evidence supports individualizing risk-stratified cancer screening, with selective application of specific
screening interventions best suited to the individual. Yet, individualizing cancer screening at a population
scale requires the implementation of personalized risk assessments which are quite challenging to achieve in
today’s overwhelmed primary care settings. A promising approach to address this challenge is to automate the
identification and management of eligible patients using electronic health record (EHR) technologies coupled
with advanced clinical decision support (CDS) tools and automated conversational agents (“chatbots”). In
previous research funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Informatics Technology for Cancer Research
(ITCR) program, we have enabled GARDE (Genetic Cancer Risk Detector), a standards-based CDS platform
for individualized cancer screening. GARDE (i) screens and identifies patients who meet National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing based on their family history and other
risk factors in the EHR; and (ii) uses automated chatbots offering patient outreach and education, offering
access to genetic testing and explanation of test results. GARDE has been integrated with two market-leading
EHR systems (Epic® and Cerner®) using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and CDS Hooks
standards. GARDE has been successfully deployed in clinical settings at two academic medical centers and
their respective cancer centers (University of Utah/Huntsman Cancer Institute and New York University) in
support of the BRIDGE trial, funded by the NCI Cancer Moonshot program (U01CA232826 – Kaphingst, PI).
The overall objective of the present proposal is to enhance and disseminate GARDE across healthcare systems
including high resource medical centers and low resource safety net healthcare systems. Our approach will be
guided by implementation science frameworks that help assess implementation readiness, identify barriers
and facilitators, identify needs for adaptation, and develop implementation strategies. Specifically, we will (i)
enhance GARDE’s chatbots using open-source technologies; (ii) deploy GARDE at new collaborating sites
(Cornell University, Medical University of South Carolina [MUSC], Beaufort Memorial Hospital); (iii) conduct
rapid iterative pilot implementations at these new sites; (iv) iteratively develop and test an implementation
toolkit based on experience with the pilot sites; (v) conduct a cost analysis to catalyze further adoption; and
(vi) disseminate GARDE beyond the collaborating sites through the implementation toolkit and direct
technical assistance. Through wide dissemination, GARDE has the potential to enable evidence-based
individualized cancer screening and reduce cancer burden through a scalable, population-based, and
interoperable approach."

Toxocariasis, caused by the dog and cat roundworm (Toxocara canis or T. cati), is the most common zoonotic
helminth infection in children living in the United States (US). Toxocariasis disproportionately affects children
from underserved communities in the US, with the highest prevalence of disease in non-Hispanic Black children
(up to 21%). Toxocariasis manifests as distinct clinical syndromes leading to life-long morbidity from epilepsy,
asthma, and blindness. Thus, toxocariasis is an important contributor to child health disparities in the US. Despite
the significant life-long morbidity, toxocariasis remains underdiagnosed in the US in large part due to limitations
of the standard-of-care Toxocara diagnostic assay, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects host antibody
against T. canis excretory-secretory (TES) crude antigen. An improved Toxocara diagnostic assay would
facilitate accurate diagnosis and evaluate treatment response in children to prevent life-long morbidity. Given
the scalability and reproducibility, recombinant proteins are an exciting technology for improving Toxocara
diagnostics. Our state-of-the art laboratory, which routinely creates recombinant proteins, generated a T. canis
cDNA library to evaluate Toxocara antigens. Immunoscreening of the T. canis cDNA library with Toxocara
infected human sera identified T. canis C-type lectins (Tc-CTL-1 and Tc-CTL-2) as the most immunodominant
antigens. We subsequently identified the Tc-CTL-1 homolog in T.cati (Tca-CTL-1) with 93% sequence identity.
Using recombinant protein technology, we developed a multiplex recombinant protein Luminex immunoassay
and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using Tc-CTL-1, Tc-CTL-2, Tca-CTL-1. The overall objective
of this project is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and potential for post-treatment monitoring of two new
multiplex immunoassays based on three, scalable recombinant proteins. We hypothesize that both multi-plex
immunoassays, utilizing the three recombinant proteins (rTc-CTL-1, rTc-CTL-2 and rTca-CTL-1), will have
improved test performance for diagnosis of toxocariasis compared to TES EIA and will permit the evaluation of
anthelminthic treatment monitoring in children. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will first determine the
performance characteristics of the two multiplex immuno-assays compared to TES EIA (standard of care) and
TES-immunoblot (TES-Blot; gold standard). Second, using both immunoassays we will quantitate total IgG and
IgG subtypes in peri-treatment sera collected from a longitudinal cohort of children with toxocariasis living in
Houston, TX. Achievement of our aims will result in at least one accurate, low-cost, scalable multiplex
immunoassay for the diagnosis and post-treatment monitoring of toxocariasis in children."

Serotonin, or 5 hydroxytryptamine (5HT) is an endogenous transmitter that is broadly implicated in many
modalities of human behavior including mood, libido, appetite and sleep, as well as peripheral functions in platelet
aggregation, immune response and bone density. In the brain, this single transmitter binds and activates seven
different families of 5HT receptors with five distinct modes of signal transduction, including all four classes of G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (Gi, Gs, Gq and G12/13) and a ligand-gated ion channel. Alterations in the relative
balance of these diverse signaling pathways by 5HT has been implicated in a plethora of syndromes including
depression, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed for
the treatment of depression, and more than 15% of adults in the US have taken an antidepressant within the
past 12 months. In theory, the efficacy of these drugs is due to their ability to increase 5HT levels by blocking
reuptake of 5HT. However, while these drugs increase 5HT levels in as little as 2 hours, it takes 4-8 weeks for
them to become effective at ameliorating depression. This suggests that the mechanism of action of SSRIs is
more complicated than simple increases in transmitter levels. We hypothesize that high levels of 5HT, produced
through use of SSRIs, can, in time, rebalance the expression levels of the various 5HT receptors and, by doing
so, provide therapeutic benefit. Specifically, we propose that some of the 5HTRs, when activated by 5HT,
undergo endocytosis and recycling/resensitization while others are endocytosed and degraded in the lysosome.
The high levels of 5HT provided by the SSRI can, thereby, drive down expression of certain subtypes of 5HTR,
while maintaining a high level of signaling through others--in effect “rebalancing” 5HT signal transduction to more
closely resemble the non-depressed state. Here, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of the endocytic and
post-endocytic properties of the entire family of 5HTRs. Remarkably, there is very limited knowledge regarding
the post-endocytic sorting properties of the 5HTRs. Hence, regardless of outcome, these data will provide new
information regarding how increased 5HT levels, due to SSRIs, could alter receptor expression and could inform
new approaches to serotonin therapeutics designed to rebalance 5HT signal transduction."

Although undergraduate enrollment in STEM majors has increased in the last two decades, graduate enrollment and
retention in STEM disciplines has remained largely unchanged for a number of minoritized and underrepresented groups.
Indeed, representation from diverse groups decreases as trainees progress along the training and career pathway from
undergraduate to graduate programs, through postdocs, and ultimately to research careers. The proposed postbaccalaureate
research program, the University of Oregon Program to Increase Resilience and Enhance Persistence in Biomedical Sciences
(UO PREP Bio), aims to address challenges in the recruitment, retention, and success along the biomedical training pathway
for scholars from underrepresented backgrounds. The transition between a highly structured, course-based undergraduate
curriculum to a largely unstructured apprenticeship model of graduate education can be a formidable challenge. This is
particularly true for students who have not had the benefit of prior experiences in science that included mentored research.
By offering intentional community building activities, individualized mentorship, productive research experiences, and
academic and professional development—all evidence-informed practices for increasing persistence in STEM fields for
underrepresented groups—UO PREP Bio will enable the successful transition from undergraduate to graduate training
among our cohort of scholars. Recruitment efforts will target trainees for whom intensive mentorship and research
experience at an RI institution would make the most significant impact in their ability to secure admission to a doctoral
program and who would benefit from community building and professional development to be able to thrive and persist in
a challenging PhD environment.
UO PREP Bio will fund four scholars annually for a one-year training program. In order to build community among the
cohort, as well as with participants in other UO research training programs, UO PREP Bio scholars will begin their training
with a summer bridge program in which they live on campus and engage in rigorous writing and graduate application
workshops. Scholars will be matched with a Mentor Team who will support them in developing an Individual Development
Plan, ensuring that their research and training schedule addresses the scholar’s personal and professional goals for their
postbac training and graduate school aspirations. By employing practices demonstrated to increase persistence in STEM
among historically underrepresented trainees, UO PREP Bio will address a significant transition period in the academic
pathway and enhance representation of scholars from diverse backgrounds in biomedical research."

 Obesity is a chronic disease that affects more than 650 million adults worldwide and has been
acknowledged as a leading cause of death in the U.S. Obesity also predisposes people to comorbid conditions
like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and some cancers. Efforts to understand and
manage this complex disease have met with modest success yet obesity and particularly severe obesity
continues to grow in prevalence at an alarming rate in both adults and children. With the formation of Nutrition
and Obesity Research Center infrastructures, it has become more frequent for clinical research cores to offer
turn-key services. This affords exemplary standardization and rigor for clinical procedures used in obesity and
nutrition research; however, it leaves an unintended training gap wherein the next generation of obesity and
nutrition scientists may not have hands-on experience with the methods or understand how to work with the
generated data. To address this gap, we plan to host an annual, 5-day course entitled: “Clinical Methods for
Nutrition and Obesity Research” at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, LA. The program
will take advantage of the cutting-edge technologies and the wide range of research efforts related to obesity
and nutrition available at the Center. During this 5-year grant, approximately 180 postdoctoral fellows and early
career faculty attendees will learn about both the gold standard and the cutting-edge clinical research
methodologies for conducting obesity and nutrition related research. The course will utilize both senior and
early career investigators to deliver a mixture of brief didactic presentations accompanied by direct observation
or actual experience with experimental procedures and handling of actual data from the Pennington/Louisiana
NORC biorepository. The course will consist of 8 modules including: 1) Pre-course orientation and reading, 2)
Responsible conduct of clinical research, 3) Body composition, 4) Carbohydrate metabolism, 5) Exercise
testing, 6) Energy requirements & energy expenditure, 7) Vulnerable populations, and 8) Career development.
Each method-focused module begins with a didactic presentation on the method theory by a senior instructor
who is a leader in the field. Next, an early career instructor (postdoctoral fellow or assistant professor) who has
been on the front lines of using the method will demonstrate and conduct the procedure on course attendee(s)
who volunteer to undergo the procedure. Finally, the senior and early-career instructor team will collectively
lead a data analysis workshop. This course will train the next generation of scientists from around the country,
particularly those from underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences, and will allow us to foster
collaborations between Louisiana scientists and others across the country who are interested in obesity and
nutrition research."

Dynamic remodeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton is crucial for a variety of cellular processes, including cell division, cell
motility and differentiation. Microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization relies on the control of individual microtubule polymers,
which switch between phases of growth and shrinkage through a process known as microtubule dynamic instability.
Although dynamic instability was discovered decades ago, the molecular mechanisms that underlie microtubule catastrophe
and rescue, the transitions between phases of growth and shrinkage, and their control through collective effects of a myriad
of regulators are still being unraveled. The goal of this project is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying
microtubule dynamics. Our central hypothesis is that conditions experienced at the time of growth have long-term effects
on subsequent microtubule behavior, including catastrophe, shrinkage and rescue. To test this hypothesis, we will employ
highly-controlled in vitro reconstitution experiments, combining purified protein components, microfluidics and high
spatiotemporal resolution light-microscopy approaches. We will determine the different impacts of distinct growth conditions
at the two microtubule ends, giving rise to their unique dynamic behaviors. We will elucidate individual and combined effects
of microtubule regulators and their underlying mechanisms. We will particularly focus on microtubule regulators that bind
both soluble and polymeric form of tubulin. At the plus end, we will investigate TOG-domain proteins XMAP215 and CLASP
to elucidate the similarities and differences in their mechanisms underlying their differential effects on plus-end dynamics.
At the minus end, we will investigate the interplay of stabilizing regulators, including Kinesin-14 HSET, and destabilizing
regulators, including tubulin-sequestering protein Op18/Stathmin and a poorly-studied microtubule severing protein
Fidgetin. Since every one of these microtubule regulators has been implicated in human disease, particularly cancer and
neurodevelopmental disorders, revealing their mechanisms of action is of direct health relevance. Our quantitative in vitro
measurements will enable us to develop mathematical and computational models reconciling the dynamics of both
microtubule ends, and encompassing the collective effects of regulators at each end. We will directly test the models
developed based on our in vitro and in silico findings in physiologically-relevant contexts using state-of-the-art fast super-
resolution quantitative live cell imaging. Beyond uncovering the fundamental mechanisms underlying microtubule dynamics
in cells, we will expand our cellular studies with a focus on the role of CLASP in cell migration and neuronal development.
Our cellular investigations will invariably yield new hypotheses to be tested by controlled in vitro and in silico experiments.
The continuous feedback between in vitro and cellular approaches will ultimately provide fundamental insights into
microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics, bearing critical relevance to both basic science and human health."

Mechanical stimuli play a major role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, and the maintenance of muscle
mass contributes significantly to disease prevention and quality of life. Although the link between mechanical
signals and the regulation of muscle mass has been recognized for decades, the molecular mechanisms that
drive this process are still not known. Hence, the long-term goal of our research is to define the molecular
events via which mechanical stimuli regulate skeletal muscle mass. The primary objective of this project is to
determine the extent to which changes in the phosphorylation of TRIM28 contribute to the mechanical
regulation of muscle mass. We are focusing on this topic because TRIM28 can control the activity of mTOR (a
kinase that has been widely implicated in the mechanical regulation of muscle mass). A recent study also
identified TRIM28 as a scaffold protein that interacts with key myogenic transcription factors (e.g., Mef2 and
MyoD), and it has been shown that phosphorylation of the S473 residue on TRIM28 can act as a switch that
unleashes the transcriptional activity of Mef2 and MyoD. This is intriguing because alterations in the activity of
MyoD and Mef2 have been widely implicated in the regulation of muscle mass, and a recent phosphoproteomic
analysis from our lab revealed that mechanical stimulation leads to a profound increase in TRIM28(S473)
phosphorylation. Moreover, we discovered that the expression of a S473 phosphomimetic mutant of TRIM28 is
sufficient to induce hypertrophy, and that the hypertrophic effect is dependent on the phosphomimetic
mutation. Combined, these observations led us to our central hypothesis: an increase in TRIM28(S473)
phosphorylation is a fundamental part of the pathway via which mechanical stimuli promote an increase in
muscle mass. To rigorously test this hypothesis, we will first use of a combination of biochemical, molecular
and genetic interventions in mice. Importantly, the mouse-based studies will enable us to: i) gain insight into
the mechanisms via which TRIM28(S473D) induces hypertrophy, and ii) define the role that both myofiber and
satellite cell specific changes in TRIM28(S473) phosphorylation play in mechanical load-induced hypertrophy.
In addition to the mouse-based studies, we will also perform a human trial to determine whether the primary
conclusions from mice can be translated to the human condition. Collectively, the outcomes of this project are
expected to establish TRIM28 as a novel regulator of muscle mass and shed light on some of the basic
mechanisms through which alterations in S473 phosphorylation control its hypertrophic effect. The outcomes
are also expected to reveal the existence of a TRIM28-dependent pathway that not only enables mechanical
stimuli to induce hypertrophy, but also the activation of satellite cell proliferation and fusion. Such outcomes
would not only dramatically advance our understanding of how mechanical stimuli regulate muscle mass, but
they would also create a new landmark for future studies that are aimed at developing a comprehensive

One of the first steps in nervous system development consists in the folding of the neural plate and closure of
the neural tube to originate the brain and spinal cord. Failure of neural tube formation leads to neural tube defects
(NTDs), which are one of the most common serious birth defects. The causes of NTDs are multiple and both
genetic and environmental factors have been identified. Among these factors, the use of antiepileptic drugs
during pregnancy increases the incidence of NTDs by unknown mechanisms. In the mature nervous system,
antiepileptic drugs decrease excitability by targeting diverse effectors. However, most studies have argued that
off-target effects of these drugs are responsible for inducing NTDs in epileptic patients’ offspring. Instead, the
effect of antiepileptic drugs on embryonic neural excitability remained mostly unexplored because of the
prevailing view that neural activity is not apparent at neural plate stages. In contrast, our recently published study
demonstrates that glutamate signaling is present in the folding neural plate and is necessary for neural tube
formation. Downregulating glutamate signaling directly or by incubating Xenopus laevis embryos with the
antiepileptic drug valproic acid causes NTDs. In this study we will discover the molecular mechanisms of
neurotransmitter signaling during neural tube formation. Challenging the prevailing view, we hypothesize that
vesicular glutamate release from neural plate cells is necessary for neural tube formation. Released glutamate
elicits calcium transients in neural plate cells that control expression and function of regulatory neural cell cycle
proteins like Sox2, which is a pivotal transcription factor for modulating neural stem cell renewal, proliferation
and neurogenesis, depending on its level of expression and posttranslational modifications. By using state-of-
the-art imaging and molecular approaches, we will discover the molecular mechanisms and spatiotemporal
profile of glutamate release and signaling during neural tube formation. We will identify downstream molecules
to glutamate release that control neural plate cell proliferation, their mechanisms of action and impact in the
formation of the neural tube. We will examine the role of glutamate signaling on the regulation of Sox2 expression
and function during neural plate folding. This study proposes a novel paradigm-shifting model in which
neurotransmitter signaling is functional at neural plate stages and is crucial for the formation of the neural tube.
The significance of the mechanistic knowledge gained form this study is based on the contribution it will make to
the field of NTDs and to the molecular understanding of the regulation of neural stem cell cycle progression,
which in turn will be relevant to research on brain tumors, brain and spinal cord injuries, neurogenesis in
neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. This study, by advancing our mechanistic understanding
of neural activity-driven neural tube formation will improve preventative measures for epileptic pregnant women."
10781337,"RPL3L, or ribosomal protein L3-like, is a highly conserved, vertebrate-specific duplicated paralog of the
ubiquitous ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3). While most ribosomal protein gene duplications are silent pseudogenes,
RPL3L is highly and exclusively expressed in adult striated muscle and is the predominant form in cardiac (~95%)
and skeletal (~60%) muscle. Such a tissue-specific paralog switching is intriguing especially given that striated
muscle comprise ~50% of body weight and 50-75% of all body protein, and that RPL3 is one of the most
important ribosomal proteins: it is the closest protein to ribosome catalytic center, functions as a gatekeeper to
the decoding center, and is required for the first step of 60S subunit assembly. Furthermore, the development-
and tissue-specific RPL3-to-RPL3L switch is reversed during muscle growth when the demand for protein
synthesis is high. We and others recently reported bi-allelic heterozygous missense mutations in RPL3L co-
segregating with severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy and fatal heart failure in five unrelated families. Despite
the evolutionary, physiological and pathological significance, it remains unclear why the genetic code in half of
human body mass is interpreted by ribosomes differ by a key component, i.e., RPL3 vs. RPL3L, in a highly
regulated manner. The mechanistic details of whether and how RPL3L ribosomes function differently from
ubiquitous RPL3 ribosomes remains poorly understood, due in part to the lack of in vitro and in vivo systems
where the relative expression of RPL3 and RPL3L are perturbed. To address this barrier, we have generated
human cell lines and mouse models predominantly expressing either RPL3 or RPL3L in cardiomyocytes. Our
preliminary results support a model that RPL3L ribosomes promote protein homeostasis in striated muscle cells.
We will use a combination of biochemical, imaging, genomics, and computational approaches to test our
hypothesis. By answering the long-standing question of why the heart needs a special ribosome, our study will
reveal how heart functions at the molecular and cellular level and establish a new paradigm for how ribosomes
specialize in tissues. From the disease perspective, our study may shed lights on the pathogenesis of dilated
cardiomyopathy and lay the foundation for the development of new therapies."

Metals play a critical role in our health. However, the study of the association between metal exposure/intake
and human health has been hampered by a lack of technology to non-invasively quantify body burden of
metals. Accurate quantification of metal body burden is important because most of the diseases related to
metal exposures develop over time, and cumulative metal body burden is the best biomarker for individual
cumulative metal exposures. Metal body burden is also the most relevant biomarker to determine the toxic
threshold of a metal, to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatments of metal-related diseases, and to provide a
method for early diagnose of metal toxicity. Metals cumulates in storage organ such as bone. However, it is
challenging to non-invasively detect metals in bone. Our lab has been continuously conducting research in the
in vivo quantification of metals and trace elements in human body. In this project, we propose to develop and
validate a highly sensitive working prototype in vivo neutron activation analysis (IVNAA) system to quantify
manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), aluminum (Al), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) in human bone. The
feasibility of the technology has been demonstrated by our preliminary work. In the proposed project, we will
solve the existing technical challenges to meet the sensitivity and reproducibility required for real-world
applications, as well as the challenges to extend the technology to broader communities. Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations will be used to design an advanced deuterium-deuterium (DD) neutron generator and a highly
efficient U-shaped NaI (Tl) gamma-ray detector, and to design the moderator, fast neutron filter, reflector, and
shielding components for the neutron irradiation system, as well as the background reduction component for
the gamma-ray detection system. The system will be set up and tested for sensitivity (detection limit) and
reproducibility once the final design is determined. Robust data analysis method and calibration procedures will
be developed and tested. We will test the system's sensitivity and reproducibility using bone equivalent
phantoms and human cadaver bones, validate the system of measuring multiple metals against ICP-MS, and
improve the design of the system for the comfortability of the human subject and easy operation. We will also
apply the system in a small local population to verify utility for human health study applications and sufficient
sensitivity and apply the system in a non-local population to verify its ability for wide adoption in human health
studies. The proposed research is expected to result in a valuable tool for the study of relationships between
chronic metal exposure and health, nutrition and health, and metal toxicity. It also has great potential to
become a clinical tool to diagnose metal toxicity or diseases related to metal exposure and trace element
intake. This R01 proposal is highly responsive to PAR-22-127, Focused Technology Research and
Development, with the goal of supporting “the development of technologies with demonstrated proof-of concept
that have remaining significant technical challenges to full implementation and broad utility”."

Group 1 CD1-restricted T cells are members of the unconventional T cell family that recognize self- and
microbial lipid antigens presented by CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c molecules. Group 1 CD1-restricted T cells
have been implicated to play critical roles in various autoimmune and infectious diseases, in particular
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. While group 1 CD1-restricted T cells represent a substantial
part of the T cell repertoire in humans, further understanding of their in vivo function and regulation in
immune response has been stymied by the lack of group 1 CD1 expression in mice. We have previously
generated a transgenic mouse model possessing the entire human group 1 CD1 locus (hCD1Tg) and TCR
transgenic mouse models with Mtb lipid and self-lipid specificity. We demonstrated that both mycolic acid
(MA)-specific and self-lipid-specific CD1b-restricted T cells confers protection against Mtb infection. In
addition, chronic activation of CD1b autoreactive T cells can lead to the development of psoriasis-like skin
inflammation in an ApoE-deficient mouse model of hyperlipidemia. As hyperlipidemia is a common condition
in HIV-infected individuals and the general population, we aim to further understand how it may affect the
function of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells during infection using Mtb infection as a model. In Aim 1, TCR
transgenic mouse models in hCD1Tg/LDLR-/- background will be used to determine the impact of diet-
induced hyperlipidemia on self- and microbial lipid-specific T cells and elucidate the molecular and cellular
mechanisms mediate such effect. The impact of hyperlipidemia on the polyclonal group 1 CD1-restricted T
cell responses to Mtb infection will also be determined by comparing bacterial burden, lung inflammation,
and magnitude of autoreactive and Mtb lipid-specific T cell responses in Mtb-infected hCD1Tg/LDLR-/- mice
with or without hyperlipidemia. While peptide-specific T cells are known to have distinct effector and memory
phenotypes, the properties of memory group 1 CD1-restricted T cells remain elusive. In Aim 2, we will
determine functional properties and protective mechanism of memory MA/CD1b-specific T cells generated
in mice vaccinated with MA containing nanoparticle (MA-NP). To identify common features associated with
Mtb-lipid specific memory T cells, we will compare memory MA/CD1b-specific T cells to glucose
monomycolate/CD1b-specific T cells, isolated from a novel TCR transgenic mouse model expressing a
conserved germline-encoded mycolyl lipid-reactive (GEM) TCR. Lasty, the transcriptional and functional
properties of memory MA/CD1b-specific T cells elicited by two vaccination approaches, MA-NP and an
attenuated Mtb strain, will be compared and their response to subsequent challenge with Mtb will be
evaluated. Collectively, these studies will pave way to better understanding of the role of lipid-specific T
cells in various infectious disease in a relevant comorbidity condition."

Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors for some types of cancer, the overall response rate remains
suboptimal. The majority of solid tumors exclude T-cells (termed “cold”), thus presenting a key limiting factor for
cancer immunotherapy. Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway has been demonstrated to induce anti-tumor
immune responses with impressive efficacy in preclinical studies. However, clinical stage STING agonists, based
on cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), suffer from major limitations, including: 1) Administration via intratumoral
injection. STING agonists administered intratumorally are cleared rapidly, and intratumoral injection reduces their
utility against metastatic cancer. 2) Conventional STING agonists do not readily cross the cell membrane, failing
to maximize activation of STING located within the cytosol. 3) Cell penetration of conventional STING agonists
is not biased to the dendritic cells and macrophages which is the cell type needed to drive an anti-tumor immune
response. 4) Conventional STING agonists do not work across the human population due to variations in STING
haplotypes. Indeed, in recent phase I clinical trials, STING agonists given intratumorally exhibited only marginal
efficacy. Hence, a potent platform for systemic delivery of STING agonists is urgently needed to improve patient
outcomes. Saros Therapeutics is developing a novel nanotechnology (referred to as SNP) that addresses each
of these limitations by: 1) Incorporating manganese along with CDA, a CDN-based STING agonist, in the nano-
formulation. We have shown that Mn augments the activation of STING by CDA, lowering the dose necessary
to achieve a significant biologic (Type I IFN expression) and therapeutic (tumor growth/survival) benefit. 2)
Incorporating the Mn-CDA complex in a nanoparticle protects the CDA from degradation, extending half-life and
facilitating uptake by myeloid cells (DC, macrophages) that drives a Type I IFN response by the immune cells in
the TME. The combination of Mn+CDA incorporated into a nanoparticle formulation also improves the safety
profile of this therapy and allows administration by IV, ensuring systemic exposure and improved responses in
settings of multiple tumors and metastasis. Based on our compelling data, we will examine the potency of SNP
preparations in human patient biopsy samples. We will assess pharmacokinetic and tissue retention
characteristics of SNP in both mice and non-human primates and benchmark against other STING agonists. We
will develop microfluidic methods for large scale production of SNP in anticipation of transfer to a contract
development and manufacturing organization (CDMO). Results from these studies will accelerate the
development of our novel nanotechnology with the aim of quickly bringing immunotherapy’s benefits to more
patients with cancer."

10912752,"Summary
The ultimate goal of this application is to develop one of Epigen’s proprietary antagonists of the lysophosphatidic
acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) for the effective treatment of liver fibrosis associated with chronic diseases such as non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe type of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is the most
common liver disease and is associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes. There are currently no effective
treatments available for NASH except lifestyle changes.
The feasibility data presented in this application establishes the proof-of-concept of one of Epigen’s LPAR1 lead
antagonists, EPGN2154, in two different mouse models of NASH and liver fibrosis. In vitro mechanistic data
confirms that LPAR1 antagonism blocks hepatic stellate cell proliferation, thus blocking an important fibrotic
pathway. Furthermore, LPAR1 antagonists block migration of macrophages stimulated by MCP-1 indicating an
anti-inflammatory mechanism. During the course of our work, we have identified combinations of drugs with
complementary mechanisms of action to EPGN2154, which provide superior efficacy in the preclinical models
and may result in greater benefit to patients.
In this phase 2 SBIR grant, we propose an approach involving a more detailed pre-clinical evaluation of
EPGN2154 and combinations in one translational animal model of NASH. For optimizing the dose and
combination regimen of EPGN2154, the HFHC-fed wild type mouse model of NASH is considered adequate
because it presents with features of human NASH. In this application, we seek to: i) conduct a detailed dose-
response efficacy study of EPGN2154 in the HFHC mouse model of NASH to determine the minimum efficacious
dose (MED), ii) conduct efficacy studies with the optimized dose of EPGN2154 in combination with commercial
GLP-1R agonists and GIP/GLP-1R agonists, iii) complete GLP safety pharmacology studies and submit an IND
to the FDA to support phase 1 clinical trials in humans. Based on feedback from Pharma and investors, an IND-
ready asset with preclinical efficacy and safety established along with a delineated clinical path, is an attractive
asset for commercialization. The successful outcome of this work will likely trigger private investment to advance
the program towards initiation of clinical trials in humans."
10762343,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, is one of the most common surgical procedures in the
United States, performed in more than 500,000 children annually. Tonsillectomies in children are most
commonly performed for obstructive sleep disordered breathing (oSDB) or recurrent throat infection. The
procedure improves oSDB symptoms, behavior, and quality of life in children with oSDB. It is also an effective
treatment for children with severe recurrent tonsillitis. Nevertheless, many children experience a resolution of
oSDB or mild tonsillar infections over time without having surgery. As such, tonsillectomy is subject to
considerable variation in use and likely overuse in some groups. Evidence of potential overuse comes from the
fact that the rate of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection is 2-3 times higher in rural white children than
non-rural white children or either black or Hispanic children. In contrast, black and Hispanic children are far
more likely than white children to have oSDB, but they are less likely to undergo tonsillectomy for this
condition. It is likely that factors acting across multiple levels and domains drive these differences in
tonsillectomy use, including factors acting at the patient/family, primary care provider (PCP), primary care
practice, surgeon, and community levels. Although it is often supposed that the large sociodemographic and
geographic variation seen in tonsillectomy use is largely explained by the varying opinions and preferences of
providers, a large body of research suggests that patient knowledge, preferences, and expectations have as
great or greater an impact than provider opinion on sociodemographic differences in rates of adult elective
surgery. An understanding of the relative importance of patient/family, clinician, and community-level factors on
racial/ethnic and geographic differences in pediatric tonsillectomy use is critically needed to maximize the
benefits of this common surgical procedure in the pediatric population, while minimizing the unnecessary costs
and complications with which it is associated. This mixed-methods project will identify and quantify the impact
of factors acting across multiple levels and domains on racial/ethnic and geographic differences in pediatric
tonsillectomy use. We will analyze healthcare utilization data from 2016-2019 on all publicly insured U.S.
children. We will also conduct interviews with diverse samples of caregivers whose children have undergone
tonsillectomy and with PCPs who refer for and otolaryngologists who perform tonsillectomy. Our findings will
facilitate future improvements in the appropriateness of care of children being considered for tonsillectomy by
informing the development and targeted dissemination of educational materials and shared decision-making
tools that can be used by families and clinicians."

10764950,"Abstract
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically both by profound
loss of balance and other neurological symptoms. Falls are central to early PSP presentation and diagnosis and
lead to fractures and hospitalization. No current treatments improve balance or prevent disease progression.
Strong pathological, molecular, and genetic evidence implicates deposits of the 4­repeat isoform of the micro­
tubule associated protein Tau (4R­Tau) in PSP pathophysiology. Current models struggle to link 4R­Tau pathol­
ogy to the debilitating falls that define PSP. Development of new therapies for PSP would benefit profoundly
from a means to evaluate interventions in the context of the neural circuits responsible for balance.
Leveraging the historical strengths of our individual laboratories, we have worked together to design a new
model system to model Tau pathology in the context of balance. Our model system uses the larval zebrafish,
a small vertebrate with exceptional molecular and optical accessibility and rigorously defined balance behavior.
In unpublished pilot experiments have used a wide set of neurological and behavioral tests show that express­
ing 4R­Tau in zebrafish neurons gives rise to: (i) molecular and cellular pathology (ii) locomotor and oculomotor
deficits (iii) systematic balance deficits that together resemble PSP. Here we propose to extend and validate
this new and exciting model.
In the R61 aim, to validate our model internally we will develop two complementary pipelines to assay balance
behavior and establish new transgenic lines and protocols to gain temporal control of 4R­Tau expression. First,
we will optimize an assay of balance with rigorously­defined quantitative behavioral endpoints suitable for effi­
cient evaluation of chemical modifiers or candidate gene targets. Next we will use a novel light­inducible trans­
gene expression system (GAVPO/UAS) for parametric control of 4R­Tau levels at particular time points. If our
balance assay and transgenic lines meet defined milestones for success, we will proceed to the R33 aim. There,
we will validate our model externally along three axis: First, we will assay construct validity by testing if a hu­
man pathogenic Tau mutant enhances the severity of observed phenotypes. Second we will assay face validity
by evaluating the pathology, neurological and balance deficits following induction of 4R­Tau. Lastly we will as­
say predictive validity by administering chemicals known to modulate tauopathy in other model systems. Our
team consists of a physician scientist specializing in movement disorders (in the clinic) and zebrafish models of
neurodegeneration (in the lab) and a basic neuroscientist who has successfully used zebrafish to understand
normal development and function of neural circuits responsible for balance. Together, we propose to establish
and validate an innovative new “phenotype­optimized” model system to address a deep unmet clinical need:
neurotherapeutic discovery for PSP in the context of its definitive balance symptoms. The work is broadly signif­
icant as it advances our ability to define general mechanisms of neurodegeneration."
10764952,"ABSTRACT: A status-quo in targeted cancer therapy is that out of the thousands of somatic alterations found in cancer,
alterations only in driver genes like oncogenes and tumor suppressors determine therapeutic strategy. For example,
cancers with deletion/mutation of the driver tumor suppressor gene PTEN and consequently elevated AKT and mTOR
signaling are considered rational candidates for PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor therapy. Accordingly, PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors are approved or in clinical trials for various cancers with PTEN/PI3K alterations. However, in glioblastoma
(GBM) where PTEN loss of function occurs in over 60% of patients, PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have been largely
ineffective. It is often overlooked that when tumor suppressor genes undergo deletion, nearby genes also undergo
inadvertent co-deletion. These bystander genes are not necessarily tumor suppressor genes. In fact, many of them are
important for cell growth and survival. In some cases, such bystander deletion events create a unique drug sensitivity
specifically in cancer cells. For example, deletion of one of the two alleles of POLR2 (a subunit of RNA polymerase II co-
deleted as a bystander to P53 deletion) reduces the amount of POLR2 protein and creates high sensitivity of these cells to
low dose POLR2 inhibitors. There are several other such bystander deletion events in cancer that causes vulnerability
specifically to cancer cells (e.g., PSMC2 deletion due to chromosome 7q22 loss, Enolase 1 deletion due to loss of 1p36
tumor suppressor locus, MAGOHB deletion as part of chromosome 1p loss, and MTAP co-deletion with the tumor
suppressor CDKN2A). Searching the TCGA database we have identified that a crucial lipogenic gene is hemizygously
deleted as bystander to the tumor suppressor PTEN (on chromosome 10) in glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer.
The fatty acid synthesized by the lipogenic enzyme is also present in our diet. Therefore, when we reduced this fatty acid
from diet, inhibition of residual activity of the lipogenic gene with specific inhibitors killed glioblastoma and melanoma
cells. This subset (subset 1) ultimately acquired drug resistance through a stress response pathway, and were eliminated by
a specific pre-clinical grade inhibitor of the stress pathway. During our analysis, we also surprisingly discovered that this
lipogenic gene in completely suppressed in a second GBM subset (subset 2) due to a combination of deletion and
methylation. Subset 2 lost a gene that is important for growth and proliferation, and yet thrived, through yet unknown
alternative mechanisms. Due to loss of the target lipogenic gene, subset 2 lines were completely resistant to the lipogenic
enzyme inhibitor. Investigating the mechanism of survival of subset 2 GBM is outside the scope of this application.
In this proposal we will use a repertoire of primary GBM lines and test if deletion and methylation status of the lipogenic
gene can be used as biomarkers for inhibitor therapy in combination with a custom medicinal diet. Secondly, we will
perform molecular, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and preclinical studies to address the mechanism of acquired
resistance of subset 1 GBM. These tests will be performed in a well-established preclinical mouse model of intracranial
glioma."
10764005,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of our research is to decipher the essential molecular mechanisms underlying successful cell
division. Errors in this process have been linked to developmental defects and diseases such as cancer. We
now know essentially every protein needed for cell division. However, analyzing the precise molecular
mechanisms needed for error-free division has continued to be very challenging for at least three reasons. First,
cell division in human cells is a highly dynamic process that can be completed in <1 hour, with key steps such
as chromosome-microtubule attachments and nuclear envelop reformation taking only a few minutes. Second,
the microtubule-based structures that dynamically self-assemble and function in dividing cells can be ~1000-
times larger than their nanometer-sized protein components. Third, this multi-step process depends on several
distinct protein-protein interactions that can be transient and mitosis-specific. To address these challenges and
fill gaps in our knowledge we have: (i) Discovered and characterized cell-permeable chemical inhibitors of key
mechanoenzymes (e.g. AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cell processes). These chemical probes can be
used to rapidly (typically, within minutes) inhibit or activate (through relief from inhibition) protein function in
dividing human cells. We combine these fast perturbations with state-of-the-art microscopy (e.g. lattice light-
sheet microscopy) and quantitative image analysis to dissect mechanisms underlying cell division dynamics in
human cells. To identify target-specific phenotypes we carry out parallel inhibitor dose-dependent analyses in
matched cell lines that are either inhibitor-sensitive or -resistant. (ii) Deciphered how micrometer-sized features
(e.g. microtubule length or overlap length) can effectively be measured by nanometer-sized proteins to generate
proportionate outputs (e.g. tags or force). For these studies we have generated a biochemical ‘toolbox’
comprised of recombinant forms of the augmin complex, isotypically-pure human tubulin, key microtubule-
associated motor and non-motor proteins and g-TuRC (g -tubulin ring complex), the major microtubule nucleator
in human cells. (iii) Developed and applied chemical proteomics approaches to ‘capture’ and profile direct,
transient and context-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells. The research proposed benefits from
our expertise and will combine chemical, structural and cell biology approaches to answer long-standing
questions, including: (a) What are the functions of different AAA mechanoenzymes during cell division and how
are their activities regulated? (b) What is the structural basis of g-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation and
how does this complex contribute to centrosome-dependent and -independent microtubule formation during
mitosis? Our research should provide new insights into fundamental mechanisms, uncover general principles
that inform on other cellular processes (e.g. microtubule organization in neurons), and may provide starting
points for developing new therapeutics."

digital innovations across the Partner Network and the CTSA consortium (Aim 4) that allow full utilization of
real world data together with rich, deep clinical information to enable discovery research from the bench to the
learning healthcare system. The CCTS Hub and Network will support ethical, scientifically rigorous, informative
clinical trials and pilot studies by providing a range of specialized services, resources and consultations (Aim
5) guided by NCATS principles of effective translational science. Through these efforts, the CCTS will
formalize its CTS Research Program (Aim 6) to identify, develop and test novel approaches to overcome
significant roadblocks in biomedical research, generating new insights that can be generalized to other CTSA
Hubs. By achieving these aims, the CCTS will harness the Network’s vibrant collaborative energy to accelerate
the discovery, dissemination and implementation of new findings, deliver treatments to more people more
quickly, reduce the burden of chronic disease and advance health equity in the Deep South and beyond."

 The Integrator Complex (INT) is a 17-subunit machinery that associates with RNA polymerase II
(RNAPII) and functions as a critical transcription regulator. It is essential for the 3'-end formation of a
variety of non-coding RNAs and is a broad negative regulator of promoter-proximally paused RNAPII.
Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11) houses the RNA endonuclease domain vital for Integrator to cleave
nascent transcripts at all RNAPII loci, which is an important activity for transcriptional repression.
Consistent with a fundamental role in Integrator function, INTS11 genetic variants are found to disrupt
human development and give rise to a complex neurological syndrome. Similarly, genetic disruptions in
two non-Integrator proteins that associate with INTS11 also impede neurodevelopment, including
BRAT1, where variants cause a lethal neonatal multi-focus seizure syndrome and cerebellar ataxia, and
WDR73, where variants cause Galloway-Mowat syndrome that is characterized by psychomotor
impairment, hypotonia, and seizures.
 WDR73 and BRAT1 associate with INTS11 and INTS9 but are primarily cytoplasmic proteins
distinct from the complete 17-subunit nuclear Integrator Complex. Notably, nothing is known about how
these proteins bind INTS11 or their role in nuclear Integrator function – especially in the context of
neuronal cell fate and fitness. Using biochemical and structural approaches, we generated cryo-EM
structures of the INTS11-BRAT1 binary complex and the INTS9-INTS11-BRAT1 ternary complex.
Surprisingly, we also find that optimal INTS11 function within the nuclear Integrator Complex requires
interaction with these cytoplasmic proteins as cells lacking BRAT1 or WDR73 accumulate uncleaved
Integrator substrates. Altogether, these preliminary studies generate a provocative model whereby
cytoplasmic BRAT1 and WDR73 are required to ‘license’ INTS11 for its nuclear activity, which is critical
to maintaining proper neuronal function in humans. To test this hypothesis, we propose these Specific
Aims: Specific Aim 1. Structurally and biochemically characterize the INTS9, INTS11, BRAT1, and
WDR73 complexes. Specific Aim 2. Probe the function of BRAT1 and WDR73 in Integrator-mediated
gene regulation. Specific Aim 3. Decipher the role of the INTS11-containing complexes in neural cells."
10777562,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 40% of US adults have obesity, many with weight-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes.
Current clinical guidelines suggest lifestyle change as the first-line obesity treatment approach, but this does not
produce sustained clinically-significant weight loss for the majority of patients. Bariatric surgery is available for
patients with more severe obesity, but due to its cost, invasiveness and risk, only 1-2% of eligible patients
undergo a procedure. Addressing the obesity epidemic using only lifestyle change programs and bariatric
surgery will continue to leave most patients without a successful long-term treatment option. Anti-obesity
medication (AOM) is an option that could help to fill the current obesity treatment gap. Recent trials have
demonstrated that AOMs lead to enduring clinically-significant weight loss, with a good safety profile. However,
many physicians remain hesitant to prescribe AOMs due to concerns about their effectiveness and safety. There
is also a complete lack of comparative effectiveness data on contemporary AOM options. Studies addressing
these issues could inform treatment choices, guidelines, and pharmacy benefit development, significantly
impacting clinical practice. We will use a nationwide commercial insurance claims dataset that includes over
350,000 unique adults with new AOM fills (data current through early-2022) to conduct the first nationwide
comparative effectiveness study of AOMs. We will compare propensity score-matched cohorts of patients
prescribed one of six FDA-approved AOMs between 2012 and 2027: phentermine, phentermine-topiramate-ER,
liraglutide, bupropion-naltrexone-SR, semaglutide, and tirzepatide (pending approval 2023). Our primary design
will use intention-to-treat analyses on new users with at least one AOM fill, but we will also conduct on-treatment
and per-guidelines analyses among patients with persistent AOM use. Our Specific Aims are to compare groups
of patients prescribed these AOMs, over up to 5 years of follow-up, with respect to: (1) Major cardiovascular
events; (2) Other clinical outcomes related to reduction in body weight, including (a) incidence of type 2 diabetes
(T2D), hypertension and dyslipidemia; and (b) Change in intensity of T2D, hypertension and dyslipidemia
pharmacotherapies (including discontinuation of therapy); and (3) Health care services use and associated costs,
including annual hospital days; emergency department visits; outpatient visits; and pharmacy, lab, and medical
costs. In an exploratory Aim, we will examine whether key patient characteristics (age, sex, baseline T2D,
comorbidity burden) modify the risks or benefits seen with each AOM. Comparative effectiveness studies
examining major clinical and health services outcomes beyond weight loss are needed to inform guidelines and
policy. Our use of a large, existing, regularly updated dataset will allow us to efficiently produce rapid-turnaround
real-world results that are highly generalizable and likely to have a significant impact on treatment of a chronic
disease that affects nearly half of American adults."
10756109,"The majority of primary brain tumors result in high morbidity and very poor survival. Brain tumors are
now unfortunately the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Medulloblastoma is the most common
malignant pediatric brain tumor resulting in the death of nearly one-third of afflicted children despite very
aggressive therapies that include surgical resection, whole brain and spine radiation therapy, and systemic
chemotherapy. Furthermore, the vast majority of surviving children have poor outcomes and significant
neurocognitive deficits due to the toxicity of these therapies. A major barrier to improving outcomes for primary
brain tumor patients is the relative ineffective delivery of therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) specifically to brain tumor cells while sparing normal surrounding brain tissue.
 Heretofore, researchers have found few mechanisms to target therapies specifically to primary brain
tumors, to avoid systemic toxicities. We seek to address this problem to improve drug therapeutic indices by
proposing a strategy to target therapies specifically to brain tumor vasculature utilizing a novel nanoparticle-
based drug delivery system that has high affinity to P-selectin on endothelial cells within tumors. Our
preliminary studies show selective nanoparticle extravasation and targeting to tumors across the blood-brain
barrier in a novel autochthonous GEM medulloblastoma model. Our team proposes a strategy to localize both
conventional and precision drugs to brain tumor tissue by targeting therapies to P-selectin on tumor
vasculature. We will employ a physiologically and genetically-relevant mouse model of Sonic hedgehog-driven
medulloblastoma to identify synergy with radiation therapy in enhancing tumor-selective nanoparticle drug
delivery, and will pursue the following specific aims: 1) To evaluate the P-selectin-mediated targeting, role of
radiation, and mechanism of extravasation across the blood-brain barrier in medulloblastoma, 2) To assess the
efficacy and toxicity of P-selectin-targeted chemotherapy/SHH pathway inhibition in Sonic hedgehog-driven
medulloblastoma, and 3) To assess the effects of focal radiation therapy of primary medulloblastoma tumors
on P-selectin and nanoparticle drug delivery to distant leptomeningeal brain tumor metastases within the
central nervous system in vivo. We will utilize biochemical and imaging methods including intravital multiphoton
microscopy, confocal immunofluorescence and immuno-EM, micro-CT for bone analysis, pharmacokinetic and
biodistribution measurements, and molecular biology approaches to assess nanoparticle delivery mechanisms,
treatment efficacy, and toxicity. Our primary endpoint is to identify tumor-selective strategies that synergize
with current standard of care therapies for medulloblastoma. Should our results prove favorable, we envision
clinical applicability to patients with medulloblastoma and other primary brain tumors as well as neurological
diseases that have been shown to have endothelial inflammation including multiple sclerosis and stroke."
10756116,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative cellular
therapy for many pediatric patients with malignant and non-malignant disorders. Approximately 2500 pediatric
HSCT are currently performed annually in the U.S. Unfortunately, transplant-related complications remain a
major barrier to successful outcomes particularly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The lung is a target of
GVHD leading to noninfectious acute lung injury and respiratory failure called idiopathic pneumonia syndrome
(IPS), often fatal. The significance of respiratory failure occurring after HSCT was recently underscored by a
June 2018 NIH workshop specifically convened to identify clinical challenges and scientific knowledge gaps
regarding pulmonary dysfunction after HSCT in pediatric patients. Mechanistic basic understanding is lacking,
and thus there remains a paucity of therapies and biological correlative studies offered. The Paczesny
laboratory has discovered that: (1) soluble STimulation-2 (sST2), the “alarmin” interleukin-33 (IL-33) decoy
receptor, as a biomarker for risk of GVHD as well as of IPS (N. Engl. J. Med, 2013; Biol Blood Marrow
Transplant. 2018); (2) Mechanistically, we have shown that sST2, secreted by cytopathic T effector cells,
sequesters IL-33, limiting its availability to T cells expressing the transmembrane molecule form of ST2, mostly
cytoprotective regulatory T cells (Science Translational Medicine, 2015); (3) blockade of sST2 with a
neutralizing monoclonal antibody (anti-ST2 mAb) or small molecule compounds reduced GVHD severity and
mortality (Science Translational Medicine, 2015; Journal of Clinical Investigation Insights, 2019), and (4) In
preliminary unpublished data, IL-33 local treatment or blockade of sST2 decrease frequencies of donor IFNγ
producing T cells while increasing recipient IL-9 producing innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2s) that controls
acute lung injury after HSCT. This significant body of preclinical and clinical data provides the basis for the
following hypothesis: Early after HSCT, the ST2/IL-33 pathway regulate IL-9-mediated ILC2s activation and
integrity, decreasing sST2 and cytopathic T effector cells, and preventing the development of IPS. Our new
hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Confirm the pathogenic cellular mechanisms of anti-ST2
neutralizing antibody mediated regulation of inflammation in the lung following HSCT in several experimental
IPS models; 2) Establish the role of IL9-ILC2s on inducing cytoprotective regulatory T cells; and 3) Elucidate
the molecular mechanisms of endogenous IL-33/membrane ST2 signaling that stimulates IL-9 production by
lung recipient ILC2s and the source of secreted soluble ST2 as a barrier to IL-33 protective effect on ILC2s.
The translational research potential of this application is significant as these studies will enhance our
understanding of how alarmins and their receptors after HSCT contribute to lung injury with the potential to
modulate these pathways and reduce the risk and severity of respiratory failure in pediatric HSCT recipients,
and thereby improve outcomes and extend the use of HSCT as well as other novel cellular therapies."
10774914,"Abstract.
While CT remains the most highly utilized diagnostic tool in clinical practice, its technology still calls for research
and development along the entire imaging chain to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. The
clinical translation of such developments must be safe, efficient, and timely; however, it remains a challenge to
the community how to precisely predict performance during and after the development phase. Technology
development can be aided by CT phantoms, which are specialized tools used to calibrate, test, and evaluate
scanners. Most existing CT phantoms are relatively expensive and lack accurate representations of anatomy
and diagnostic tasks. There is a lack of patient-based phantoms that fully represent attenuation profiles and
textures seen in clinical CT acquisitions, which this proposal aims to address.
As a result of its ability to create accurate and detailed physical models at a fraction of the cost of traditional
methods, three-dimensional (3D) printing has become increasingly popular in medicine. CT phantom 3D printing
studies include manufacturing geometrically accurate organ models, generating realistic texture samples, and
generating accurate attenuation profiles. Although these approaches produce phantoms that are more similar to
actual anatomical structures, several limitations remain, such as the loss of the natural look and feel of
anatomical and pathological features.
Recently, we proposed a 3D printing solution, called PixelPrint, that can achieve accurate organ geometry, image
texture, and attenuation profiles while eliminating the complexities and limitations of previous methods. Our
solution is a one-step method for translating CT or simulated images into printer instructions. As a preliminary
study shows, isolated organs can be replicated so lifelike that an expert reader can't tell the difference between
the CT scan and the original. Our proposal aims to develop 3D printing hardware and software that will be
capable of creating patient-based phantoms with accurate spectral x-ray characteristics and a natural look and
feel of anatomical and pathological structures. By completing the following aims, we aim to provide a more
efficient and cost-effective method for developing and validating novel CT technology: (i) to design and construct
a dedicated multi-material, quad extruder 3D printer for CT phantoms, (ii) to develop algorithms to preprocess
and translate spectral CT images into instructions for 3D printing, and (iii) to evaluate the performance and
reproducibility of patient-based CT phantoms.
The academic and clinical CT community will benefit from a rapid and inexpensive manufacturing process. To
drive dissemination of our development, we will, as part of this project, distribute dedicated patient-based
phantoms to academic institutions. Our research environment and our team’s unique breadth of expertise are
perfectly placed to execute this project. By utilizing the proposed phantoms, the community will be able to
facilitate the translation of novel CT technologies for various diagnostic tasks into clinical practice."
10782445,"Summary
The kidneys control extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure by adjusting the excretion of Na to match the
dietary Na intake and the overall physiological needs of the organism. Aldosterone is a key hormone that helps
to mediate this process. In response to a reduction in extracellular fluid volume the adrenals increase secretion
of this steroid, which in turn signals parts of the renal tubule (the so-called aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron)
to increase Na reabsorption. This occurs at least in part through stimulation of the uptake of Na from the urine
across the apical membrane through epithelial Na channels (ENaC). How this occurs, however, is incompletely
understood. In the most prevalent model of this process, aldosterone stimulates the synthesis of a key enzyme,
the serum and glucocorticoid induced kinase (SGK1). SGK1 then phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2,
inhibiting its interaction with ENaC and diminishing the rate of channel internalization. Na reabsorption is then
enhanced due to increased residence times of the channels at the apical surface. However, several lines of
evidence suggest that this is not the main mechanism through which the hormone operates. First, the effects of
inhibiting the binding of Nedd4-2 to ENaC by truncating the C-terminal of the ENaC surface (mimicking Liddle’s
syndrome in humans) are synergistic with those of elevated aldosterone levels (5,10). This is not expected if the
two manipulations affect the same cellular processes. Second, analysis of ENaC distribution in the cell and the
excretion of ENaC protein in urinary exosomes suggests that the major effect of aldosterone is to increase
forward trafficking to the apical membrane (18). Finally, measurement of the ubiquitination state of ENaC
indicates that when transport is stimulated by aldosterone the number of ubiquitinated subunits increases,
whereas the standard model predicts a decrease. In the work described in this application, we will examine a
revised model of ENaC trafficking that is more consistent with these data. Here subunit protein is expressed in
excess even under basal conditions when the need for transport is minimal. The main hormone-stimulated event
is transport of ENaC protein from the ER to the plasma membrane. Arrival at the apical membrane exposes the
channels to urinary proteases, which mediate the final proteolytic processing and activation of the channels.
This increases the susceptibility of the subunits to ubiquitination, limiting their lifetime at the surface and/or their
active states. This model will be tested using a variety of experimental techniques including quantitative Western
blots to estimate subunit numbers, immunocytochemistry, in situ biotinylation and Western blotting to assess the
cleavage states of ENaC subunits, electrophysiology to measure overall channel function, and ubiquitin assays
to assess the modification of channels is subcellular compartments."

There are currently 200,000 hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors in the U.S today, a number that
will exceed 500,000 by 2030. Despite improvements in overall survival, long-term HCT survivors remain at high
risk for chronic health complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular complications,
such as myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy/heart failure, are not only more common in HCT survivors,
but they occur earlier than in the general population; in essence, HCT is associated with accelerated
cardiovascular aging. However, as highlighted by the recent NIH HCT Late Effects Consensus Conference, the
biological mechanisms underlying this problem remain unknown. Our overall hypothesis is that multiple
sequential organ system and metabolic impairments sustained prior to, during, or after HCT accelerates
depletion of cardiovascular physiologic reserves (cardiovascular reserve capacity), predisposing to early onset
CVD. To test this hypothesis, we will measure cardiovascular reserve capacity in a group of HCT survivors
over time. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), as derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing, is the gold
standard measure of cardiovascular reserve capacity, because it represents the integrative efficiency with
which multiple organ systems deliver and use oxygen for ATP resynthesis. Using a longitudinal study design,
we will evaluate VO2peak at baseline (prior to HCT), 6 months, one year and two years post-HCT, allowing us to
determine its trajectory over time. We will also determine the impact VO2peak on self-reported physical
functioning, and identify populations at high risk for accelerated VO2peak decline after HCT (Aim 1). Importantly,
we will use novel diagnostic strategies to define the organic-specific determinants of VO2peak and its impairment
after HCT (Aim 2). By the end of our study, we will have: 1) established initial VO2peak in patients undergoing
HCT and characterized its post-HCT trajectory over time, identifying patients at highest risk for decline after
HCT; 2) informed the screening for subclinical CVD, using strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical
setting; and 3) identified mechanisms by which organ-specific impairments, alone and in combination,
contribute to abnormalities in VO2peak after HCT. This proposal builds on our previous successful research and
will address important knowledge gaps about cardiovascular complications in HCT survivors. Information
obtained from this proposal will support development of evidence-based interventions to decrease the risk of
CVD after HCT. The growing population of long-term HCT survivors makes development of prevention
strategies imperative, to ensure that these survivors live long and healthy lives well after completion of HCT."
10782450,"Astrocytes are key players in regulating neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. We have recently shown
that astrocytes participate in brain functions thrugh “team-work”. Specifically, a strong gap junction coupling,
astrocytes achieve a state of syncytial isopotentiality across the brain that is crucial for potassium homeostasis.
Now our new studies further show that acute disruption of syncytial isopotentiality impairs neuronal excitability
nad synaptic transmision. However, our understanding is still in its infancy with respect to how the syncytial
isopotentiality is established and dynamically regulated through crosstalk with neuronal signals. To begin to
gain insight into this system-wide electrical feature of the astrocyte network, the objective of this proposal will
be mostly focused on how neuronal signalings regulate syncytial isopotentiality.
Our new studies show that intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is a key regulator of the electrical coupling of astrocyte
syncytium. Also through regulating [Ca2+]i, glutamate potentiates electrical coupling of astrocyte syncytial
coupling. At the basal physiological level, norepinephrine signaling is indicated to bidirectionally regulate the
set point strength of astrocyte coupling through Gq-coupled α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR). Thus, we
hypothesize that neuronal norepinephrine signaling establishes the set point of syncytial coupling, whereas
glutamatergic signaling induces a novel form of glioplasity for potentiation of astrocyte syncytial coupling.
Our first specific aim will establish the role of [Ca2+]i in bidirectionally regulating the electrical coupling of
astrocyte syncytium. The electrophysiology and chemogentics with astrocytic expression of Gq-DREADD will
be used in these studies. The second aim will determine the mechanism underlying a glutamatergic signaling-
induced potentiation of syncytial coupling. Hippocampal CA3→CA1 glutamatergic transmission will be
activated in wildtype and conditional Cx43 knockout (hGfap-Cre:Cx43flox/flox) mice to validate that this glial
network plasticity is mediated through Cx43 in an [Ca2+]i-dependent fashion. The third aim will determine the
role of norepinephrine signaling in establishing a set point strength of astrocyte syncytial coupling. This
hypothesis will be examined through pharmacologial and genetic manipulation of astrocytic α1-AR.
The completion of this project is expected to validate the view that astrocyte syncytium indeed interacts as a
functional system with neuronal signaling. We expect to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of the basic and plasticity of astrocyte syncytial coupling. Ultimately, these results are expected to
shed light on a new research direction, in which the mysterious function of astrocytes can be explored at a
biologically higher hierarchy, the level of the syncytial system. This work in healthy CNS lays the foundation for
exploring how alteration of astrocyte syncytium etiologically contributes to diseased and injured brains."

It is not clear why some individuals with allergen-specific IgE suffer from allergies, while others do not. It is likely
that multiple factors contribute, including differences in IgE affinity or epitope diversity for allergens, mast cell
numbers, FceRI expression levels, Syk signaling, allergen-specific IgG antibodies, and anti-IgE antibodies. An
addition factor that has not been considered is the contribution of differences in IgE constant chains, and specific
its glycosylation. We recently compared the N-linked glycans on IgE from peanut allergic and non-allergic adults
and found reduced sialic acid on complex biantennary glycans of non-allergic IgE. Further, removal of sialic acid
from IgE resulted in markedly reduced anaphylaxis in both human and murine models. Our long-term goal is to
understand how glycosylation of antibodies regulates, and is regulated, by immune responses. Our central
hypothesis is that specific glycan on IgE lacking sialic acid engage an inhibitory receptor that attenuates mast
cell and basophil degranulation. Indeed, this is supported by preliminary data shown in this application. The
rationale for our studies is that determining how IgE lacking sialic acid is attenuated will identify novel pathways
that regulate allergic disease, identify novel therapeutic targets for atopic diseases, establish IgE glycosylation
patterns as biomarkers for disease, and rewriting the dogma of IgE biology. We will test our central hypothesis
and, thereby, attain the objective of this application by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Define the
inhibitory glycan structure on IgE that is exposed following sialic acid removal; 2) Determine how removing sialic
acid from IgE leads to its attenuation. Using an approach that combines biophysics, biochemistry cellular and
molecular immunology, and glycobiology, we will determine how IgE lacking sialic acid is attenuated, define a
novel anti-anaphylactic pathway, establish pathogenic IgE glycosylation patterns, and attenuate anaphylaxis by
modulating IgE glycans. In addition to enabling discovery of biomarkers marking allergy-causing IgE, the studies
here will potentially result in identification of novel therapeutic targets for allergic disease. Finally, these studies
will have impact beyond allergy in diseases in which IgE is involved, including systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) and helminth infection."

The cranial neural crest (CNC) cells, the migrating multipotent cells giving rise to different
derivatives composing the majority of the craniofacial structures including bone, cartilage,

in the most common congenital human birth defects like cleft lip/palate, craniosynostosis, and
genetic syndromes, giving a large impact of the life of patients and their families. Therefore, the
objective of our proposed study is to understand the molecular regulatory mechanism regulating
CNC development. Key Hippo signaling roles have been broadly observed in development and
diseases involving many different tissues and organs. However, Hippo's role in craniofacial
development is still poorly understood. Wnt signaling is known to play a pivotal role in CNC
development and cross talks with Hippo signaling in some context like in heart, whereas there is
a knowledge gap of Hippo and Wnt interaction in craniofacial development. We have obtained
promising preliminary data indicate that Hippo signaling interacts with Wnt signaling and plays a
critical role in regulating CNC-derived craniofacial development. In this proposed study, we will
dissect the important roles of Hippo-Yap pathway in CNC cells migration and differentiation, and
how Hippo and Wnt pathways cross talk to regulate CNC derived craniofacial development. The
goal of the proposed studies is to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying CNC
development and help to develop novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic tools for craniofacial

The Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the severest form of acute lung injury (ALI), and is
characterized by injury to the alveolar-capillary unit and compromised alveolar epithelial integrity, leading to
high permeability pulmonary edema and neutrophilic alveolar inflammation. Failure to repair the damaged
alveolar membrane leads to significant mortality. Studies from several laboratories, including our own, have
found that induction of ALI in animal models is associated with increased expression of matrix
metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), a protease that has been shown to directly target cell-cell junctions and to
degrade basement membranes, although it was unknown at what stages of ALI pathology this process was
most critical. Other laboratories and ours have also found that transgenic mice lacking MMP-3 are resistant to
lung injury induced by multiple stimuli, indicating that inhibitors of MMP-3 have potential as therapeutic agents
for ARDS, although such a therapeutic strategy would need to be highly selective, as other MMPs have been
shown to play key roles in repair of lung injury. In this translational application, we propose experiments which
will bridge these critical gaps. In Aim 1, we will use physiologically relevant cell culture and animal models of
ALI/ARDS including novel transgenic mice to define how MMP-3 affects the resolution of epithelial injury in
response to acid aspiration or influenza infection. In Aim 2, we will use our directed molecular evolution
platform to create variants of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) with greatly increased affinity for
MMP-3 and decreased binding to beneficial MMPs, and we will define the therapeutic utility of these TIMP
variants in mouse models of ALI/ARDS. In Aim 3, we will interrogate clinical samples of ARDS to determine the
precise stages of human disease progression at which therapeutic intervention would be most beneficial. Our
research proposal will define a newly-discovered mechanism by which MMP-3 drives ARDS pathology through
an integrated research plan that links single cell RNA sequencing of cell populations isolated from ARDS
patient tissue, cell culture and animal models of ARDS, and analysis of relevant ARDS biomarkers and ex vivo
culture of precision cut human lung slices, and will develop a novel selective inhibitor with immediate
therapeutic potential. Our multidisciplinary research team is uniquely suited to address these questions. Our
work will address critical mechanisms underlying ALI/ARDS, will use this knowledge to develop personalized
strategies that will identify patients at highest risk of developing ALI/ARDS, and will create therapeutic
approaches based on the pivotal role of MMP-3 in the pathogenesis of epithelial injury leading to ALI/ARDS."

Established in August 2017, the University of Southern California (USC) Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center
(NCCC) Office of Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) coordinates 19 different
cancer training and education initiatives within the NCCC: nine (47%) programs are NCI funded. While all
programs foster participation of diverse trainees, four (21%) programs focus solely on underrepresented minority
(URM) populations and three (16%) programs focus on training in cancer disparities research. CRTEC initiatives
start in elementary school and span the training continuum from undergraduate students to junior faculty. CRTEC
is led by the NCCC Associate Director for Training and Education, Yves DeClerck MD, and relies on the advice
of an Internal CRTEC Advisory Committee of nine members and a T32 grant coordinating committee of four T32
Principal Investigators, all of whom are NCCC members. CRTEC's mission is “To prepare the next generation
of basic, translational, clinical and population scientists, with a focus on convergent science, inclusion,
and diversity”. This mission is achieved with four specific aims: 1) to train the next generation of researchers
in the conduct of cancer convergent science; 2) to create a pipeline of integrated training and educational
programs with an emphasis on underrepresented populations; 3) to develop innovative education programs for
health care professionals and community cancer educators; and 4) to evaluate the impact of these programs on
trainees' career evolution in the cancer field. Notable is the newly created Cancer Research Education and
Training Evaluation (CREATE) centralized database at NCCC. During this grant period, CRTEC reached 77
undergraduate students (36.4% URM), 214 graduate students (19.2% URM), 51 post-graduate trainees (37.3%
URM), and 26 junior faculty members (61.5% URM). Jointly with COE, CRTEC trained an additional 147
community health educators in our catchment area (predominantly Hispanic) over the last 2 years. Notably, NCI

10744803,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Cancer Epidemiology (CE) Program
The mission of the Cancer Epidemiology (CE) Program is to investigate the determinants of cancer risk and
progression through epidemiological studies strongly grounded in the relevant biology. The program
also includes the development of novel biostatistical approaches that incorporate complex biological measures
from population-based studies to elucidate mechanisms and pathways. The CE program is led by Christopher
Haiman ScD, a cancer and genetic epidemiologist whose research is focused on genetic risk of prostate and
breast cancer, and V. Wendy Setiawan PhD, an expert on cancer risk factors, disparities, and big data linkages
whose research focuses on liver, pancreas and endometrial cancer. The program has 25 members who
collaborate within CE and throughout NCCC to accomplish three Specific Aims: 1) Elucidate the role of genetic
factors in cancer etiology and outcomes with emphasis on different racial/ethnic populations; 2) Elucidate the
role of environmental and lifestyle factors in cancer etiology; and 3) Develop and apply methods for integrative
statistical analysis of ‘omics’ data in environmental and genetic epidemiology research in cancer. During this
funding cycle, CE members made major novel discoveries including: 1) identification of potentially carcinogenic
molecular signatures in e-cigarette users; 2) elevated risk of pancreatic cancer among individuals with late-onset
diabetes in African Americans and Latinos; 3) cytomegalovirus as a novel risk factor for acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma (MM); 4) demonstration that exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for
breast and brain cancer and is associated with decreased survival; 5) development of a multiethnic polygenic
risk score for prostate cancer that is being translated to a clinical study with collaborators in the TACS Program;
and 6) identification of disparities in prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its role as risk factor for
liver cancer among minority populations. Through effective evaluation and planning, CE established new
Program goals, catalyzed intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations, and fostered effective junior faculty
mentorship. During the current grant period, CE investigators published 607 papers, of which 33% are intra-
programmatic, 20% are inter-programmatic, 76% are multi-institutional, and 26% are high impact (IF >9).
Members hold $13.5M in cancer-relevant funding, of which $12.2M is peer reviewed and $6.4M is NCI funding
(directs). The CE Program contributes critically to NCCC’s mission of decreasing the cancer burden in the
catchment area through knowledge of etiologic risk factors underlying cancer disparities."

The Cancer Control Research (CCR) Program of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC) seeks
to understand and modify cancer risk behaviors, improve cancer screening, and enhance cancer survivorship.
CCR has two new co-leaders in this grant cycle: Jennifer Unger PhD, an expert on tobacco-related health
disparities, cultural risk, and protective factors for cancer-related behaviors, and Myles Cockburn PhD, who
develops, evaluates, and translates skin cancer prevention programs in the catchment area. Under their
leadership, CCR has developed new intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations with a sharp focus on the new
NCCC Strategic Plan priorities to develop multi-level models of cancer risk for precision prevention and to reduce
cancer disparities and risk behaviors in our catchment area. The Specific Aims of CCR are: 1) To understand
and modify cancer risk behaviors and improve cancer screening, with emphasis on cancer disparities
and 2) To assess and improve cancer outcomes, with emphasis on cancer disparities. Indeed, the CCR's
33 members include national leaders in tobacco and vaping, obesity and physical activity, cancer screening, and
adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancers, all with a focus on reducing cancer burdens and disparities in our
catchment area of Los Angeles County (LAC). CCR members are PIs/MPIs on major collaborative grants that
directly address catchment relevant cancer risk factors and behavior change, including: NCI U54 Tobacco Center
for Regulatory Science (TCORS); NIH U01 to develop mHealth interventions; NIH P30 on environmental risks
for obesity in Hispanics; and NIH U01 on health behavior adoption and maintenance. Transformative
achievements in the current period include: (1) among the first to link e-cigarette use with initiation of combustible
tobacco products in teens, and to document the impact of flavoring; CCR members testified to inform the newly
signed bill in California (2020) banning sweet flavoring; 2) documenting the marketing of e-cigarettes to youth
with claims of health benefits, leading to implementation of new policies to limit youth access to e-cigarettes use
in Los Angeles County; 3) developing an efficacious skin cancer prevention intervention for underserved youth
which has been adopted by schools in Southern California; 4) revealing significant financial toxicity and ethnic
disparities in follow-up care among AYA cancer survivors; and 5) documenting under-utilization of breast cancer
genetic testing that might otherwise improve treatment options for women. During the current grant period, CCR's
33 full members published 630 cancer-relevant articles (28% intra-program, 26% inter-program, 41% multi-

collaboration with other NCCC Programs. GER is led by Michael Stallcup PhD, who has made breakthrough
discoveries in steroid hormone signaling and transcriptional regulation, and Yali Dou PhD, renowned for
translation of epigenetic discoveries into novel inhibitors. Aligned with the NCCC Strategic Plan priorities focused
on multi-modal biomarkers of cancer evolution and translational drug development research, the Program's
Specific Aims are to: 1) Define the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic features that are distinct in
cancer cells relative to normal cells, and 2) Characterize regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways
responsible for cancer phenotypes to identify and validate novel potential therapeutic targets. In the
current grant period, GER members made major discoveries of critical genes and pathways, leveraging the new
systematic process at identifying and prioritizing potential targets to advance in a go-no-go pipeline under the
new Center for Cancer Drug Development at NCCC. Signature achievements include: 1) identifying antiviral
gene expression as a marker of response to DNA methylation inhibitors in leukemia; 2) creating novel
bioinformatics pipelines that define tumor-specific enhancer elements, linked transcription factors, and target
genes as drivers of breast and prostate cancer; 3) identifying mechanisms by which GRP78 and HSP90α escape
to the cancer cell surface and drive cell survival, and demonstrating that antibodies against GRP78 and HSP90α
have anti-tumor effects in animal models of various cancers; 4) establishing small molecule modulators of
transcriptional regulation of the cellular circadian clock as new potential therapeutic agents; and 5) identifying a
new inhibitor of a histone kinase that eliminates multiple types of cancer cells. With support from NCCC, GER
fosters member interactions and drives novel collaborations through weekly and annual Program meetings,
junior member mentoring, cancer-focused PhD programs, and participation in NCCC-organized Disease
Research Affinity Groups and the Targets to Therapies Steering Committee. GER has 40 full members who hold

10774230,"Abstract
Normal cells employ several fundamental brake mechanisms to tightly coordinate the execution of different cell
cycle phases. Loss of these checkpoint controls is a hallmark of cancer. Our goal is to devise therapeutic
strategies targeting newly discovered checkpoint perturbation mechanisms in cancers harboring mutant p53.
Tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator for G1 cell cycle checkpoint. Mutant p53 mediates gain of functions to
promote tumor progression and drug resistance. Nevertheless, how to target mutant p53 in cancer remains a
big challenge. Our preliminary study identifies several novel mechanisms by which mutant p53 interacts with a
checkpoint activator protein TopBP1 physically and functionally to perturb the checkpoint control, and induces
ACTL6A to promote cisplatin resistance. We propose that the mutant p53-TopBP1 axis is a valid therapeutic
target in cancer. We have developed two classes of novel TopBP1 inhibitors that can target the mutant p53-
TopBP1 axis. In this proposal, we will determine their therapeutic potential in targeting checkpoint dysfunction in
cancer. First, we will study how the mutant p53-TopBP1 axis perturbs replication control. Second, we will
determine the functional interaction between mutant p53 and ACTL6A in growth control and cisplatin resistance.
Third, we will investigate new combinations of targeted therapy against breast and ovarian cancers. The novel
TopBP1 inhibitors that we have developed will greatly enhance the feasibility and impact of this proposal. In
short, the proposed study will elucidate novel mechanisms of checkpoint perturbation and translate our
discoveries into new therapeutics for a broad range of cancers."
10774232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers, with a 5-year overall survival
(OS) rate of 7% for metastatic disease and less than 20% for locally advanced disease. Benefit from current
therapies including chemoradiation and surgery is often modest and transient. The significant challenge in the
field is how to turn immunologically cold PDAC into hot tumors that respond to immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB) therapy. We recently showed that irreversible electroporation (IRE), a tumor ablative technique currently
used in the clinics, significantly sensitized PDAC to anti-PD-1 ICB, leading to long-term survival in ~40% mice in
an aggressive orthotopic PDAC model. The remarkable anti-PDAC activity was attributed to efficient induction
of immunogenic cell death and stromal perturbation in favor of tumor infiltration of CTLs. As part of an effort to
define approaches to further enhance the efficacy of IRE + anti-PD-1 combination against PDAC, we uncovered
novel immune suppressive mechanism through time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) immune profiling and
single cell RNAseq of PDACs, which showed significant infiltration of CXCR2-expressing myeloid suppressive
cells (MDSCs). Furthermore, we found that IRE collapsed glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
while upregulated glutaminase and glutamate, suggesting glutaminolysis as a compensatory mechanism to
satisfy energy and biosynthesis needs of IRE-treated cells. These data, taken together with the known critical
role of MDSCs and heightened glutamine metabolism in immune suppression, the findings by others that the
anti-diabetic drugs metformin and phenformin fundamentally change the tumor metabolic program to sensitize
tumors to ICB therapy, and our preliminary findings that both IRE and Re-Phen, a newly developed analogue of
phenformin, downregulated the OxPhos pathway while displaying an opposite effect on glutamate production,
lead us to hypothesize that attenuation of the immunosuppressive TME by depletion of MDSCs or suppression
of glutaminolysis by Re-Phen potentiates IRE + ICB to further prolong overall survival and increase the rate of
durable response. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) To identify
immunosuppressive factors associated with long-term versus short-term response to IRE + ICB. We will use
CyTOF immune profiling, scRNAseq, and cytokine array analyses to fully characterize the impact of IRE in the
presence and absence of anti-PD-1 on the immunosuppressive TME. 2) To determine the extent to which
therapies directed at MDSCs potentiate IRE + ICB. 3) To determine the extent to which disruption of the
metabolic program by theranostic agent Re-Phen potentiates IRE + ICB. The findings from this project are
expected to reveal previously undefined roles of MDSCs and deregulated metabolic programming in immune
suppression in the context of combined IRE + ICB therapy. Success of this project will have exceptional impact
because it will offer a potentially effective therapy for PDAC."
10774233,"Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and fatal clinical condition characterized by
inflammatory lung injury, airspace edema, and hypoxemia. The syndrome occurs in an estimated 190,000
patients annually and complicates approximately 24% of admissions to the intensive care unit for mechanical
ventilation. The estimated mortality of ARDS is between 35-40%, yet there are currently no effective
pharmacological interventions targeted at the disease pathophysiology. Development of disease-specific therapy
has been limited by the heterogeneity of ARDS. The identification of biologically-defined subgroups in ARDS
may facilitate a precision medicine approach for novel ARDS therapy. The receptor for advanced glycation
endproducts (RAGE) pathway is a promising target for ARDS therapies. RAGE is a multiligand pattern
recognition receptor on alveolar epithelial cells that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses. RAGE
ligands such as HMGB1, AGE, S100A12, and other damage-associated molecular patterns provoke
inflammatory signal propagation via RAGE. The soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has been implicated in impaired
alveolar fluid clearance and is a leading biomarker for ARDS risk and mortality in human studies. RAGE
modulating therapies have been shown to improve acute lung injury in animal models, but the translation to
human ARDS is challenging. We applied Mendelian randomization (MR), a genetic causal inference method, to
plasma sRAGE to assess the association with ARDS risk. Our MR method identified a potential causal
relationship between plasma sRAGE and ARDS risk. However, it is unknown whether plasma sRAGE directly,
or indirectly via other pathways that shape plasma sRAGE levels, drive the observed effect. Our global
hypothesis is that the RAGE pathway causally confers risk for sepsis-associated ARDS, and a RAGE molecular
signature can define a sepsis subgroup at high risk for ARDS. This application will use a cohort of septic subjects
to characterize the causal contributions of RAGE-cleaving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and RAGE ligands
to ARDS risk, and develop predictive utility thresholds to enrich future clinical trials with patients likely to benefit
from anti-RAGE axis therapies. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a precision medicine approach
to ARDS therapy based on the RAGE axis. Aim 1 examines the role of RAGE-cleaving MMPs in conferring risk
for ARDS using MR and mediation analysis. Aim 2 evaluates the causal contributions of the major RAGE ligands
to ARDS risk using MR. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a predictive model that employs RAGE-axis-
based thresholds to identify a high-risk population for ARDS in two independent cohorts of critically ill patients
with sepsis. The predictive model from Aim 3 may be used for population enrichment in future clinical trials of
anti-RAGE axis therapies. The specific aims, training objectives, and structured mentorship in this proposal will
bestow the candidate with the necessary expertise in the mechanisms of lung injury, cohort management, causal
inference, and predictive modeling for a career as an independent translational researcher in ARDS."
10756527,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Radical intermediates generated through chemoselective single electron reduction have broad utility in the
development of valuable synthetic transformations. As a consequence, photoredox catalysis, which induces
single election transfer with exceptional selectivity for radical pathways, has shown great promise as an
enabling technology in biomedical research. However, the design underpinning current photoredox catalysts
limits the accessible reduction potentials and excludes numerous abundant feedstocks. The selective
generation of radical intermediates from substrates inert towards conventional photoredox catalysis is a long-
standing challenge with no general solutions.
This proposal is based on the discovery that electrochemistry can generate new radical anion photocatalysts
that are exceptionally potent excited state reductants but retain the selectivity of typical photoredox catalysts.
We will study how these new catalysts can be exploited to develop radical coupling reactions infeasible with
modern synthetic tactics. The three specific aims of this research center on exploring distinct but interwoven
aspects of this new catalytic platform.
Aim 1. We are exploring the ability to generate and exploit the reactivity of aryl radicals from aryl chlorides
Aim 2. We are exploring the ability to engage carbonyl compounds in reductive radical coupling reactions
Aim 3. We are exploring operationally simple strategies to access radical anion photocatalysts
These methods address long-standing challenges in a fundamental class of organic reactions, reductions.
These new catalytic systems will offer an expanded and diversified pool of starting materials from which the
next generation of drugs and molecular probes will be discovered."

Viruses are a major threat to human health. Our laboratory uses various structural biology techniques to
dissect molecular mechanisms of how viruses replicate and invade the host cell or its genome. One area of our
major interest is retroviral integration, a critical step in the lifecycle of retroviruses that achieves permanent
insertion of the reverse-transcribed viral genome into a host chromosome. We will build on our recent structural
studies of the Human T-cell Leukemia virus and Rous sarcoma virus intasomes and further investigate the
roles of host factors during integration of these retroviruses. Another area that we are pursuing is the
replication of coronavirus RNA genomes and host cell invasion. In particular, we are interested in how a virally
encoded exoribonuclease complex facilitates faithful replication of the large RNA genomes of coronaviruses,
and how this unique proofreading activity could be modulated by small molecules. We are also investigating
inhibition of the receptor binding of the coronavirus spike protein by novel antibodies and antibody-mimics.
Overall, the studies proposed in this application will help better understand important RNA-based human
pathogens and could aid in the development of antiviral strategies, or alternatively, gene delivery tools useful in
research or gene therapy applications."

Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2 encoded by SMPD3 gene) is a membrane associated enzyme that
catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) into phosphorylcholine and ceramide. Formation of ceramide-
enriched areas by the action of nSMase2 is known to facilitate generation of extracellular vesicles, which
participate in intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological processes through
encapsulation and transfer of diverse types of substances including tau protein. Interestingly, post-mortem brains
from AD patients exhibit abnormal increases in ceramide. Inhibition of nSMase2 has therefore become an
attractive therapeutic strategy to treat AD by inhibiting EV biogenesis to slow the spread of pathogenic cargo.
The main objective of this project is to conduct structural optimization using (R)-(1-(3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2,6-
dimethylimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-8-yl)pyrrolidin-3-yl)-carbamate (PDDC), a prototype nSMase2 inhibitor, as a
molecular template with the ultimate goal of identifying development candidates with balanced overall
pharmacological profiles required for clinical translation. By assembling a multidisciplinary team of investigators
with complementary expertise, we are poised to seize this opportunity by executing the following specific aims;
(Aim 1) Conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on nSMase2 inhibitors containing a core scaffold
different from that of PDDC; (Aim 2) Characterize the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)
and in vitro selectivity/toxicity profile of potent nSMase2 inhibitors from Aim 1. Identify optimal dosing for efficacy
studies in Aim 3; (Aim 3) Evaluate selected nSMase2 inhibitors from Aim 2 for efficacy and tolerability in an AAV
tau propagation model and a PS19 transgenic model of AD."

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects over 20 million individuals in the US and as CKD progresses, the risk of
hip fractures increases by 2 to 5-fold. Renal Osteodystrophy (ROD), the bone component of CKD-Mineral Bone
Disorder is complex with both high and low bone turnover and bone quality changes, and remains a treatment
challenge. Over the past 25 years, the therapeutic focus has been to lower the PTH level but this has not resulted
in a change in the fracture rate. This implies that there are factors in CKD that are additive to PTH in inducing
bone fragility. Recent studies in patients without CKD have identified the importance of the gut derived uremic
toxin indoxyl sulfate that accumulates due to reduced renal clearance. Indoxyl sulfate is a ligand for the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) important in detoxification of toxins and the promotion of multiple aging and bone
phenotypes. In our rat model of CKD that parallels the human bone phenotype, our preliminary data
demonstrated the oral administration of inulin, a fermentable dietary fiber, alters the gut microbiota and reduces
serum levels of IS. This dietary intervention led to higher bone volume, decreased osteoclast number, and
decreased cortical porosity. Using an osteocyte cell line for a model of osteoblast to osteocyte differentiation we
also demonstrated that indoxyl sulfate increased AhR activity and altered genes important in osteocyte
differentiation, function and mineralization. Based on these data, we propose the hypothesis that impaired
bone quantity and quality in CKD is due to the interaction of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate on osteocyte
function mediated through aryl hydrocarbon signaling. To test this hypothesis we will conduct the following
aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the interaction of indoxyl sulfate and PTH on osteocyte function and abnormal
bone quantity and quality. We will manipulate the indoxyl sulfate levels through dietary inulin and PTH levels
through pharmacologic therapies in vivo in our Cy/+ CKD rats. Outcomes are bone quantity (microCT),
histomorphometry, osteocyte apoptosis and immunostaining, osteocyte mineralization (Raman spectroscopy,
nanoindentation), and whole bone mechanical properties. We will also utilize cultured osteocytes to further
understand the interaction of IS and PTH on gene expression and signaling in osteocytes. Specific Aim 2: To
define the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the involved signaling pathways on osteocyte function, bone
quantity, and bone quality. We will induce CKD using adenine in the diet in AhR null mice and selective AHR-/-
osteocyte mice and assess bone quantity and quality. We will also utilize primary osteocytes and pharmacologic
inhibitors to understand the cell signaling pathways involved. These studies will determine the role of IS and AhR
signaling in the osteocyte dysfunction of CKD, offering novel targetable mechanisms to improve bone quantity
and quality and prevent fractures."
10781514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The 75-90% lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in Down syndrome (DS) is a significant health concern for
the DS community. Despite the progress of large international consortiums preparing the field for upcoming
clinical trials, there are currently no validated remote assessment options for tracking AD-related cognitive
decline for adults with DS. Remote assessment offers numerous benefits to participants and researchers and
will support recruitment and retention in AD clinical trials, which involve many study visits to assess cognitive
and behavioral changes throughout a pharmaceutical or behavioral intervention. Additionally, remote
assessment will enhance the accuracy of longitudinal research studies by allowing more frequent data
collection without significantly increasing participant burden. Using remote assessments will open participation
to those in rural communities, those with low economic statuses, and racial/ethnic groups who may not have
the time or resources for the travel and cost that in-person participation requires. This study will focus on the
life stage when AD pathology is beginning (22 – 55 years old) to ensure that those in beginning stages of
disease progression are included in the study sample. All cognitive measures selected to transition from in-
person to remote administration have been shown to be promising for tracking early AD. The K99 phase of the
study will focus on the feasibility and modification of remote administration to ensure families are satisfied with
remote assessment procedures. The R00 phase will focus on evaluating the reliability and validity of remote
measures by comparing performance to in-person assessments, investigating test-retest performance, and
measuring change over 16 months. The R00 phase will also include a blood draw to examine associations
between cognitive measures and plasma AD biomarkers. Methodology is innovative in that it involves a new
frontier of remote assessment tools and incorporates plasma biomarkers of AD to compare remote and in-
person cognitive performance to AD pathology. There are three primary aims of the proposed study (1)
Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of remote assessments to measure AD-related cognitive
decline in adults with DS, (2) Evaluate the reliability of each remote AD cognitive assessment and construct
validity with in-person cognitive assessments, and (3) Determine sensitivity of remote and in-person AD
cognitive assessments to plasma biomarkers of AD pathology. This project’s goals are aligned with the NIH
INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE)
initiative and will serve to increase measurement options for treatment studies in AD and DS and subsequently
improve reach and representation of diverse individuals in clinical trials and DS research."
10780813,"Kidney transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage kidney disease, however, organ
shortage is a global crisis.
We have developed a novel technique, named improved Synchronization Modulation Electric Field (i-SMEF).
The i-SMEF not only controls the Na/K pump activity, but also generates ATP molecules. In a recent publication,
we demonstrated that application of the i-SMEF on donor kidneys effectively protected transplanted graft
functions in a mouse kidney transplantation model. However, it is unknown if the i-SMEF could repair the injured
cells during ischemia, thereby exhibiting more protective effects on marginal organs.
 In the present proposal, we will examine the role of the i-SMEF in a protection against ischemic injury in
cultured cells, isolated kidneys, and kidney transplantation models in rats and pigs. We propose to test our
hypothesis that the i-SMEF rescues and repairs the injured cells in marginal organs during storage and exhibits
more protective effects than in standard criteria donor kidneys via delaying ATP depletion, preserving
mitochondrial function, preventing Na/K pump translocation, and reducing the inflammatory response.
 We believe that the novel concept that the i-SMEF controls renal Na/K pump activities and repairs injured
kidney cells during storage would update and advance our understanding of the regulation and significance of
the renal Na/K pump activity in ischemia. Its applications in kidney transplantation are expected to have imminent
translational significance in expanding the donor pool and improving the long-term survival of transplanted grafts.
Moreover, the i-SMEF is expected to exhibit important protective effects against acute kidney injury in vascular
and kidney surgeries that may compromise renal blood supply."
10780899,"Abstract
With the near-eradication of polio, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has become the most frequent cause of acute flaccid
paralysis. There are two major forms of GBS, demyelinating and axonal, based on the primary injury to myelin/Schwann
cells or axon of the myelinated nerve fibers, respectively. Current immunomodulatory treatments are only effective in a
proportion of patients. For example, IVIG–a first line treatment modality in GBS–hasten recovery in only ~50% of those
treated with this medication. Despite availability of current of immunotherapies, a significant proportion of patients are left
with severe and permanent neurologic sequelae, including inability to walk independently. There is a dire need for
newer/additional immune treatments that can target relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms and limit the neural injury in
acute phase of the disease. Cellular inflammatory effectors are invoked to play major role in the pathogenesis of
demyelinating GBS, whereas autoantibodies against gangliosides/glycolipids are involved in the pathogenesis of axonal
GBS. Human pathologic studies and data from animal modelling indicate that macrophage lineage cells are final executioner
of nerve injury in demyelinating and axonal GBS. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) plays critical role in
proliferation, survival and function of monocytes and fully differentiated macrophages including transmigration in response
to its ligand(s). We hypothesize that blockade of this receptor on macrophage lineage cells can alter the macrophage
recruitment and reduce endoneurial macrophage burden and associated inflammatory nerve injury. This hypothesis will be
tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1 will examine the efficacy of CSF1R blockade (with a neutralizing antibody
and a small molecule inhibitor) in: a) anti-ganglioside antibody-mediated model of axonal GBS; and b) transgenic T-
lymphocyte mediated inflammatory demyelinating model of GBS. Studies under Aim 1 will also compare IVIG to CSF1R
antagonists in axonal and demyelinating GBS models. Synergy between CSF1R inhibitors and IVIG will also be examined
in this Aim. Aim 2 will examine the role of CSF1R signaling in infiltration of circulating monocytes/macrophages in the
injured nerves by generating bone marrow chimeras and bone marrow derived-macrophage and peripheral nerve tissue co-
culture model. These studies will use wild type, CSF1 mutant osteopetrotic, and transgenic CSF1R deficient mice. Aim 3
will validate the expression of CSF1 and CSF1R in nerves obtained from GBS and related chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and compared to diseased and nondiseased controls. The

10781651,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), which affects approximately 6 million people in the United States, is a
debilitating chronic inflammatory disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. HS presents as painful
abscesses, boils, nodules, and fistulous tracts and patients with HS had the highest morbidity of all skin
diseases. Treatment plans can average 14 years with patients trying multiple options to find relief. Even
excisional surgeries have a high recurrence rate. Currently, clinical assessments of HS are accomplished
through visual inspection and palpation, which underestimate disease stage and severity. Histological
analysis identifies changes in vascularization, emerging fluid buildups, emerging tunnels, and structural changes
in collagen, keratin and lipids not visible by clinical inspection. Ultrasound (US) imaging can aid in HS diagnosis
and staging, but is infrequently used in the United States and is limited to detection of structural defects. Using
optical excitation and acoustic detection, photoacoustic (PA) imaging has the capability to detect many
biomarkers of HS identified by histology and could aid in HS diagnosis and treatment planning. The PI, an expert
on PA imaging, has led a number of observational trials involving human imaging and has gathered input from
dermatologists, pathologists, radiologists and HS surgeons on desired specifications for an HS imaging system.
Here, he has assembled a strong team which has the background, experience and expertise to design, develop
and test a portable PA/US imaging system with an easy-to-use hand-held probe for HS. The system, which
will collect and analyze PA/US 3D volumes of an entire skin section, will include an algorithm that will
automatically generate an HS likelihood map that calculates probability of HS involvement voxel-by-voxel across
an entire imaging area. This goal will be accomplished through three Specific Aims: 1) Development of a 3D
PA/US system with a hand-held probe to create volumetric data from HS lesions. The system and all components
will be designed, optimized, and tested. 2) Identify and validate HS-specific PA biomarkers and use them to
generate HS likelihood maps. We will collect PA/US data from subjects with HS and quantify biomarkers
associated with HS. The biomarkers will then be used to generate a likelihood map, whose accuracy will be
validated using healthy controls and histology data. 3) Demonstrate capability of 3D PA/US for (a) planning
excisional surgeries by comparing PA proposed surgical volumes with 3D projections of the surgeon’s
photographed surgical outline and (b) analyzing effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments by comparing
likelihood scores with clinical scores of treatment response. Impact. HS is typically assessed by visual
inspection, palpation, and patient history. The proposed PA/US imaging system and associated HS-detection
algorithm (the likelihood map) not only holds promise for reducing HS morbidity in direct clinical use by enabling
more accurate surgeries and better-targeted pharmacological treatments, but will also assist future HS
investigators to develop more effective drugs and individualized therapeutic strategies."

10745986,"7. Project Summary
The primary goal of this proposal is to develop an effective approach to screening for
early stages of pulmonary fibrosis by assessing the diagnostic and prognostic value of
clinical, environmental, genetic and genomic factors in at-risk relatives of patients with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF, the most common and severe form of
pulmonary fibrosis has a mortality rate comparable to that of many end-stage
malignancies. Although IPF has historically been unresponsive to pharmacotherapy,
recent studies have finally demonstrated that medical therapy can reduce the rate of
decline in lung function, particularly when started early in the course of disease. In the
prior grant cycle of this application we demonstrated that first-degree relatives were at
high-risk to develop early stages of pulmonary fibrosis and that genetic testing helped to
improve risk prediction. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that we will continue to
observe a high prevalence of early pulmonary fibrosis in at-risk relatives; that we will be
able to develop a clinically useful screening algorithm that combines key clinical, genetic,
genomic, and environmental features for the early detection and prognostication of
interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) and/or pulmonary fibrosis in populations of diverse
ethnic backgrounds; and that a subset of genes whose reduced expression predicts
accelerated disease progression harbor pathogenic variants that help to drive this
process. To assess these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1)
Develop an algorithm that can be used in clinical practice to identify relatives at the
highest risk for pulmonary fibrosis, Aim 2) Prognosis: Define the baseline clinical,
genetic, and genomic features in relatives found to have ILA that best predict their risk of
disease progression, and 3) Identify novel genetic variants that contribute to pulmonary
fibrosis susceptibility using an integrative genomics approach. In addition to providing a
greater understanding of the role of that genetic variation plays in the development of
IPF, the results from this study will motivate a clinical trial evaluating the use of
screening and early therapeutic intervention in relatives at high-risk to develop IPF."
10745996,"Project Summary/Abstract
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease characterized by progressive scarring of the lungs,
ultimately impeding the ability to breathe. Pathological recruitment of fibroblasts to sites of tissue injury and
subsequent activation into scar-forming myofibroblasts are critical steps in the development and progression of
pulmonary fibrosis. Accordingly, the identification of the molecular mediators directing fibroblast recruitment
and myofibroblast activation, will not only further enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of lung
fibrosis, but also provide rational therapeutic targets for novel anti-fibrotic therapies. We and others have
recently shown that increased matrix stiffness in fibrotic lungs promotes mechano-activation of fibroblasts.
Further, matrix stiffness amplifies tissue fibrosis by locking stiffness-activated myofibroblasts on a mechanical
positive feedback loop, by not fully understood mechanisms. We have recent evidence that matrix stiffness
gradients produced in fibrotic lung tissues promote fibroblast recruitment to sites of tissue injury via durotaxis –
the directed migration of cells from regions of lower to higher stiffness, which occurs independently of diffusible
chemoattractants or substrate-bound haptotactic cues. As fibroblast “durotax” to regions of increased stiffness,
the stiffness of these regions would drive the arriving fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts.
Consequently, the central hypotheses of this proposal are that: (1) fibroblasts are recruited to sites of focal
tissue injury via durotaxis, a mechanism in which cells migrate up stiffness gradients independently of
chemotactic signals; and (2) that inhibition of fibroblast durotaxis has the potential to be a new therapeutic
strategy for IPF. The studies proposed in this application are designed to visualize fibroblast durotaxis in vivo,
to define molecular mechanisms of fibroblast durotaxis and to develop novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit
durotaxis. Specifically, we propose: (1) To image fibroblast durotaxis ex vivo using multiphoton microscopy in
precision cut lung slices and to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting fibroblast durotaxis in vivo in a
mouse model of lung fibrosis by inhibiting the mechanosensitive FAK/Paxillin pathway; (2) To define
mechanisms by which the αvβ3/FAK/Paxillin pathway regulates matrix rigidity sensing and durotaxis in IPF
fibroblasts. We will investigate both biochemical and biophysical regulators of αvβ3 integrin and their role in
fibroblast durotaxis; and (3) To define mechanisms by which actin-microtubule crosstalk mediates fibroblast
durotaxis. Specifically, we will investigate mechanisms by which α-TAT1-mediated microtubule acetylation
controls dynamic recycling of αvβ3/FAK/Paxillin complexes in durotactic cells. We will also test the role of
αTAT-1 in fibroblast durotaxis and pulmonary fibrosis in vivo in the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis, using
fibroblasts-specific αTAT-1 KO mice generated by our laboratory. The experiments proposed in this application
will provide new knowledge regarding the role of fibroblast durotaxis in the development and progression of
lung fibrosis, and the potential efficacy of anti-durotactic therapy for the treatment of lung fibrosis."
11122953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cross-sector decision makers—such as community service providers, public health, justice, advocates, and
payers—are calling for actionable data to be collected and shared in sustainable, useful ways. Oregon ranks last
in the U.S. for access to substance use services and first in opioid and methamphetamine use. A recent state-
wide analysis estimated that service gaps may even be larger than previously estimated. The proposed study
aims to make data that are relevant to decision makers available to them in easy-to-use formats so that they can
make timely, evidence-informed decisions to reduce substance use service gaps and overdoses, and ultimately
improve health. We will leverage the roll-out of a first-of-its-kind policy in the United States—Ballot Measure 110
(M110). M110 is bringing unprecedented levels of funding to expand services aligned with the pillars of overdose
prevention statewide, and it decriminalized the possession of personal amounts of substances. Both critics and
advocates of M110 have called for better data to provide a holistic picture of substance use service and service-
recipient impacts, and to inform looming decisions such as how to allocate opioid settlement funds. To meet this
need, consistent with goals of the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term Data2Action Program call for
Innovation Projects with cross-sector partnerships, we propose to develop, refine, and test a policy
implementation strategy—Discovery and Design Sessions (DDS)—to engage cross-sector decision makers in
conversations about what data are of priority to them and to develop feasible protocols for linking and
disseminating data through products that they co-design (e.g., reports, simulations, dashboards). In the R61
phase, we will strengthen and expand existing partnerships with five types of decision makers, including state
agencies responsible for monitoring and/or implementing M110 and for maintaining a statewide data repository.
DDS, DDS-generated data products, and co-developed protocols for data sharing and for study-generated data
collection will be refined for feasibility and testing. In the R33 phase, counties will be cluster randomized to
participate in DDS and receive fully tailored data products (N = 18) or to later receive products only (N = 18) in
a stepped-wedge design. We will: (Aim 1) identify whether DDS is an efficient, generalizable strategy to optimize
policy implementation based on the comparative usability of DDS-generated data products between counties;
(Aim 2) test the impact of DDS on substance use service gaps and service-recipient outcomes, as well as cross-
sector collaboration; and (Aim 3) examine whether DDS-generated data products are associated with concrete
actions (e.g., funding) to strengthen the availability and quality of evidence-based, culturally-responsive
substance use services. Based on study results and partners’ input, we will provide state decision makers with
recommendations and protocols for supporting sustainment of study infrastructure and output, including: feasible
methods for prioritized data collection and data product dissemination, and the transfer of study-generated data
to state-wide data infrastructures. The proposed study holds strong potential for immediate, real-world impact."
10746001,"In the US, ~24 million persons live with COPD, half undiagnosed, and ~150,000 die of COPD
annually. COPD causes over 700,000 US hospitalizations and costs nearly $50 billion per year. The
human and financial burdens of COPD could likely be reduced if disease progression and other
adverse events could be anticipated, enabling caregivers to focus finite resources on at-risk patients.
We propose to create a decision-support tool that integrates biomedical informatics with advanced
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to predict acute and chronic healthcare
encounters (hospital admissions, readmissions, and ED encounters) and major disease progression
events (home oxygen therapy) for outpatients with COPD. Such a tool would confer immediate clinical
benefits and accelerate research on COPD disease progression and treatment. Predictive modeling is
widely used to identify high-risk patients for care management in COPD and other disorders, with a
strong emphasis on readmission risk. However, extant techniques are not sufficiently accurate and do
not identify the specific nature of likely future medical events, estimate time-to-event, and specifically
forecast medical encounters and disease progression events for individuals with COPD. Recent
research in disease progression modeling support the application of DL and other ML methods to
electronic health records (EHRs) to predict aspects of health history. EHRs contain both readily
accessible structured data (e.g., lab results in well-defined fields) and unstructured texts such as
physician’s notes. Unstructured texts contain a great deal of clinical information, but this information is
laborious to access; impeding its routine use in research and the clinic. This has motivated attempts to
use natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate annotation. We will apply NLP to identify
symptoms, treatments, procedures, diagnoses, social risk factors, and functional status from clinical
notes, expanding the data available from EHRs far beyond the usual coded variables. Also, and
distinctively, we will carry out a stepped-wedge clinical implementation of the proposed predictive tool
and evaluate its performance, a first for ML and DL prediction of COPD health events. Therefore, we
propose four Specific Aims: AIM 1: Transform EHR data streams to provision patient-level feature sets
for ML and DL consumption. AIM 2: Develop a set of ML and DL models to predict the time-to-event
for home oxygen therapy initiation and healthcare encounters among patients with COPD. AIM 3: To
develop and implement a prospective performance surveillance and calibration maintenance system to
maintain the final Aim 2 model for each outcome. AIM 4: Evaluate adoption and usability of the
DeepCOPD toolkit in near-realtime clinical use in two healthcare systems. The application is
responsive to the NHLBI IDEA2Health (NOT-HL-19-712)."
10745947,"Optimization of Clear Optically Matched Panoramic Access Channel Technique (COMPACT)
 for large-scale deep-brain neurophotonic interface
With the advance of sensitive molecular indicators and actuators, neurophotonics has become a powerful
paradigm for discovering the principles underlying neural circuit functions. However, a major obstacle of
using light to study neurons located deep in the mammalian brain is the limited access depth. Even with the
advance of multiphoton microscopy, the majority of implementation for imaging the mammalian brain is
limited to ~ 1 mm in depth. The majority of the mouse brain still remains inaccessible to cellular resolution
measurement, not to mention the brain of larger mammals. To image deep brain regions, invasive miniature
optical probes are required. One key issue with these optical probes is the tiny tissue access volume which
limits the number of neurons to be imaged and reduces the success rate of experiments.
 Towards large-scale deep-brain neurophotonic interface, we have recently developed Clear
Optically Matched Panoramic Access Channel Technique (COMPACT), which can effectively increase the
tissue access volume by ~ three orders of magnitude. To maximize the impact of the COMPACT platform,
we propose to optimize COMPACT in three major areas. First, we will further miniaturize the implementation
of COMPACT. Second, we will enable COMPACT based fiber photometry and optogenetics. For these two
applications, we can further reduce the capillary diameter to 160 μm. Multiple capillaries can be inserted in
the mammalian brain to create the neurophotonic interface “highway” system. This development will
complement the existing paradigm of mesoscale sampling with electrode array probes by providing an
optical version of whole-brain-access high-capacity recording and modulation system. Third, we will develop
head-mounted two-photon COMPACT system for freely moving animal studies.
 To benchmark the system performance, we will carry out extensive in vivo measurement of neuronal
structure and activity in the living mouse brain. Specifically, we will quantify and optimize the imaging
resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and maximum imaging depth outside capillary. Moreover, we will simplify
and automate the operation procedure so that it can be easily adopted by neurobiologists. With the
progress of the technology development, we will also work to broadly disseminate the COMPACT based
technologies. In addition to scientific publication, we will develop a comprehensive website similar to that of
the Miniscope project to include the detailed mechanical and optical design files, system calibration and
alignment routines, surgical procedures, and customized control software. The ultimate goal is to make
COMPACT robust, turn-key, and broadly available to transform how we use light to study mammalian brains."
10760257,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Effective responses in Fc-dependent, antibody-mediated killing for therapeutic ablation
require efficient and productive interactions between the cell-type specific Fc receptors of the host and the
therapeutic monoclonal antibody. The lack of effective responses in many patients, perhaps as much as 30%,
represents both an opportunity and a challenge to delineate the mechanistic basis for such differences.
Genetic inquiry can identify the contributions that the host brings to these differences. Our preliminary data
indicate that nearly one-third of persons have structural variants (SV) in the classical Fc locus in addition to the
prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms affecting affinity of ligand binding, receptor mobility in the plane of
the cell membrane and quantitative receptor expression. These larger structural variants affect Fc receptors
on both lymphoid and myeloid cell series, and nearly a third of these variants are uncharacterized in terms of
genomic structure, resultant alterations in protein structure and impact on net biological function. New,
innovative technical approaches including linked-reads sequencing, now confirmed with conventional PCR,
have demonstrated novel structures in genomic organization. Application of CRISPR/Cas9 targeted excision
of the locus, coupled with linked-reads sequencing now enables resolution of novel structural variations
impacting biological function. Coupled with the potential to enhance expression of key activating receptors,
there is the exceptional opportunity to enhance both the host response to therapeutic mAbs but also to
vaccination protocols. Accordingly, the aims of this proposal are 1) enabled by our characterized cohort of
donors (N > 5,000) with different ancestral backgrounds, to characterize the genomic organization of novel
structural variants using linked-read, locus specific excision and long read strategies; 2) to identify the
predicted novel receptor proteins and their structures and assess their expression and function, including
possible decoy, signaling deficient structures; and 3) to develop a scalable, generalizable platform to assess
the repertoire of SNPs and larger genomic structural variants in the human FCGR genetic locus to understand
the population diversity in our expanding donor pool (>10,000) and assess the ability to predict response to
therapeutic antibody therapy. Assessment of the portfolio of receptors, their structures and their expression
will enable strategies for selection and stratification of recipients for an optimal precision medicine approach."
10894721,"Background: Despite medical advances, up to 70% of health outcomes are due to social determinants of
health (SDoH) - the conditions in which people live and work that shape whether basic needs (e.g., housing,
food) are met. These associations are especially well documented for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In
response, health policy leaders recommend screening and referral (S&R) for unmet needs in clinical settings,
and the American Heart Association recently concluded that the most significant opportunities for reducing
CVD death and disability lie with addressing the social determinants of cardiovascular outcomes. A limited but
promising evidence base supports these recommendations but more rigorous research is needed to guide how
best to intervene on unmet needs that affect health.
Significance/Impact: This project addresses the Office of Social Work’s priority to link Veterans with resources
and services in support of treatment goals, the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation’s
priority to enhance the physical, emotional, and social well-being of the whole person, the Office of Health
Equity’s priority to reduce disparities, and the HSR&D priorities of health equity and population health. Our
study will provide much-needed evidence to document the burden of Veterans’ unmet needs, inform how best
to address unmet needs, and assess how such a process can affect adherence (to medications and
appointments), utilization, and clinical outcomes.
Innovation: VA currently systematically screens for only two unmet needs (homelessness and food insecurity).
Identification of other unmet needs (and referral to address them) occurs on an ad hoc basis, with varying
approaches among clinics/ clinicians. We will implement comprehensive screening of eight unmet needs and
systematic referral, developing tools and processes that, if efficacious, can be implemented within VA (and
other) clinical systems. VA is currently funding several studies related to SDoH, but none test interventions that
systematically identify a wide range of unmet social needs among Veterans and connect Veterans with
identified needs to social service resources.
Specific Aims: 1) Describe the burden and distribution of eight unmet needs (i.e., housing; food insecurity;
utility insecurity; transportation; legal guidance; employment; safety; and social isolation) among Veterans with
or at-risk for CVD, and identify their associations with sociodemographic characteristics, and baseline health-
related behaviors and clinical outcomes; 2) Compare the effects of three S&R study intervention conditions of
varying intensity on Veterans’ connection to new SDoH resources (primary outcome), reduction of unmet
needs, adherence, and clinical outcomes, and 3) Identify barriers and facilitators to Veterans’ connecting with
social services and having needs met, and explanatory factors for observed RCT outcomes.
Methodology: We propose a 3-year, two-phased mixed methods study. In Phase One (Aims 1 and 2), we will
implement a three-armed randomized controlled trial at three VA sites to compare outcomes among Veterans
randomized within each site to one of three study conditions: screening only; screening plus provision of
tailored resource sheets; or screening plus resource sheets plus social work support. For each Veteran, we will
examine associations of unmet needs with baseline outcomes (Aim 1), and longitudinally examine the impact
of each approach on connection to new SDoH resources and follow-up outcomes over a 12-month period (Aim
2). In Phase Two (Aim 3), we will conduct interviews with Veterans and representatives of the VA- and
community-based programs to which Veterans are referred because of the trial to identify facilitators and
barriers and potential explanatory factors related to the relative success of the interventions.
Implementation/Next Steps: If the intervention yields positive results, findings will be used by partners to
support more widespread implementation of it throughout VA."
10931513,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
Telehealth utilization increased rapidly across the US healthcare system in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. As we emerge from the pandemic, telehealth has become a new option for communication between
patients and providers. Cancer care delivery appears well positioned to incorporate telehealth into the standard
workflow of patient care. Furthermore, equitable implementation of telehealth could potentially increase access
to care among vulnerable patients. However, emerging data suggest disparities with telehealth utilization
access among non-White, low income, and non-English speaking individuals. Inequitable implementation of
telehealth could inadvertently create barriers among our most vulnerable patients, which could paradoxically
increase cancer health disparities. Large-scale rigorous research evaluating disparities in telehealth utilization
within the post-COVID-19 cancer care environment is lacking. Furthermore, research has not addressed how
telehealth utilization influences safety and quality of care compared to conventional in-person visits, particularly
among our at-risk populations with higher baseline risks of poor outcomes and adverse events. Finally, a
comprehensive understanding of telehealth disparities requires an understanding of patient perceptions and
provider biases towards telehealth, which represent important unaddressed questions. To fill these critical
knowledge gaps, we propose a comprehensive population-based cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries
with cancer, incorporating linkages to secondary datasets providing data on providers, hospitals, and regional
factors. We will assess the impact of telehealth on vulnerable cancer populations through the following aims: 1)
identify and characterize disparities in telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) assess the
impact of telehealth on efficacy and safety of cancer delivery among at-risk populations; and 3) define
actionable patient-level barriers and provider biases with telehealth utilization. This proposed study will help
define the national landscape of telehealth among cancer patients, and will provide a framework for the
development of future interventions to optimize telehealth among at-risk patients. This timely project will deliver
actionable information to providers, healthcare systems, and policymakers. Overall, equitable, safe, and
effective telehealth delivery stands to increase access to care and reduce cancer health disparities among our
most vulnerable cancer patients."
10761771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hookworm infection is a leading cause of malnutrition and growth delay in poor countries, especially in sub-
Saharan Africa where millions of people are infected with Necator americanus. Data from human studies
suggest chronic hookworm infection also impairs routine vaccine efficacy and exacerbates other globally
important, co-endemic infectious diseases. Current strategies to control hookworm rely primarily on Mass Drug
Administration of standard anthelminthic drugs, although recent evidence calls into question the long-term
effectiveness of this approach to control and eliminate hookworm in endemic populations. Since 2007, Yale
University and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana have
collaborated to characterize the epidemiology of hookworm infection in endemic communities. The longitudinal
field study proposed in Aim 1 will further probe the epidemiology of hookworm by defining risk factors for
infection, response to deworming, and reinfection following treatment in the Bono East Region, Ghana.
Experiments outlined in Aim 2 will be focused on characterizing changes in the frequency of resistance
associated mutations in the N. americanus β-tubulin gene using Next Generation Sequencing methods, as well
as the impact of drug pressure on genetic diversity and the population genetics of human hookworms in
Beposo. Critical to the detailed study of hookworm pathogenesis is the availability of a facile animal model that
is both reproducible and accurately reflects the major clinical features of human disease. Little is known about
N. americanus strains originating from populations in Africa, resulting in a significant gap in our understanding
of hookworm biology, genomics and evolution. Building on experience in maintaining the laboratory model of
Ancylostoma ceylanicum hookworms, field isolates of N. americanus cultured from study subjects in Ghana in
2019 have been used to establish patent infections in hamsters. In the experimental studies outlined in Aim 3,
clinical parameters and the kinetics of primary infection with the Ghana strain of N. americanus will be fully
characterized in the hamster model. Cellular, humoral and mucosal antibody responses to primary infection,
reinfection and vaccination with hookworm proteins will be defined. In addition, novel proteomic methods will be
applied to define human antibody profiles that correlate with infection status, intensity and risk of reinfection.
The overarching goals of the research outlined in this proposal are (1) to identify factors associated with
hookworm infection among people living in Beposo, Ghana, (2) to characterize the impact of deworming
pressure on drug resistance markers and genetic diversity of hookworms in Ghana and (3) to characterize the
first laboratory adapted African strain of N. americanus and optimize its utility for the study of human hookworm
epidemiology, pathogenesis and vaccine development. Results from these innovative studies will enhance our
understanding of hookworm pathogenesis in Africa and inform future development of public health tools to
reduce the global burden of this neglected tropical disease."
10781154,"The vimentin intermediate filament cytoskeleton can quickly sense and respond to stress in the environment,
and under certain conditions become altered through post-translational modifications (PTMs) to alter its
function and disassemble into soluble oligomers for extracellular release. Extracellular vimentin (eVim) has
emerged as a regulator of both physiological and pathological processes, however we lack an in-depth
understanding about the molecular mechanisms that regulate eVim function. Using an ex vivo post-cataract
surgery model that recapitulates the major features of the lens fibrotic disease, posterior capsule opacification,
our studies revealed a role for extracellular, cell-surface vimentin in promoting wound healing and fibrosis. In
response to cataract surgery wounding, eVim became released into the extracellular environment, bound to
the cell-surface of myofibroblast progenitor cells, linked to causing fibrosis and promoted a fibrotic response to
lens injury. The objective of this proposal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which eVim drives a
pathological fibrotic outcome to lens injury. The central hypothesis is that lens wounding stimulates alterations
to the cellular environment leading to the activation of factors that cause changes in intracellular vimentin
leading to the release of eVim into the extracellular space, and in the process vimentin has acquired a distinct
structural form and molecular characteristics that shape eVim pro-fibrotic function, including the ability of eVim
to bind to the cell surface of myofibroblast progenitor cells and signal a pathological outcome to lens injury. The
rationale fundamental to this proposal is that completion of these studies will provide important new insight into
the molecular regulation of eVim function in driving fibrosis that can be applied to understanding eVim function
in other pathogenic processes. The proposed work will also identify key aspects of eVim regulation that may be
targeted to prevent a fibrotic outcome to lens injury. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following three
specific Aims: 1) Investigate mechanisms mediating vimentin release into the extracellular space and cell-
surface binding post-lens wounding, 2) Investigate the mechanisms by which extracellular vimentin signals
fibrosis in the lens and 3) Investigate the state of extracellular vimentin linked to driving lens fibrosis post-
injury. We will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of molecular and biochemical techniques,
including vimentin-linked polyacrylamide gels, a novel tool developed to study how eVim interacts with the
surface of cells. The proposed research is significant, because there is a lack of comprehensive
understanding about the conditions that regulate vimentin release by cells, binding of eVim to the surface of
cells, and the eVim-dependent signaling intermediaries that promote fibrosis. It is also significant because the
specific oligomeric form(s) and modifications that eVim adopts to modulate its function to drive lens fibrosis are
elusive. The expected outcome of this work is to provide new insight into the molecular details regarding how
eVim function in wound healing becomes altered to induce a fibrotic outcome to lens injury."
10764957,"Abstract
Lysosomes are the primary degradative cellular organelle. Lysosomal dysfunction has been liked to several
neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s Disease. In Parkinson’s Disease, neurotoxic aggregates are
trafficked to lysosomes and can result in lysosomal rupture. Lysosomal rupture threatens neuronal health. Thus,
neurons rely on quality control mechanisms that rescue lysosomal integrity or protect the cell from lysosome-
mediated cell death. Lysosomal quality control begins with an attempt to repair damaged lysosomes. Lysosomal
repair requires the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery. If repair fails,
ruptured lysosomes are then selectively sequestered by autophagosomes and degraded via a form of selective
autophagy termed lysophagy. Lysophagy occurs in a stereotypic process that begins with the addition of ubiquitin
to damaged lysosomes. This ubiquitin interacts with selective autophagy receptors, linking autophagy cargo to
the newly formed autophagosome. How lysophagy and the repair phase are coordinated in neurons is unknown.
Removal of lysosomal ubiquitin during the repair phase could prevent premature lysophagy. Ubiquitin removal
is facilitated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). There are two ESCRT-associated DUBs in humans. My
preliminary data suggest that in human iPSC-derived inducible neurons (i3Neurons), damaged lysosomes recruit
the DUB AMSH, and expression of AMSH in HeLa cells is sufficient to decrease ubiquitin on damaged
lysosomes. However, the role of AMSH in lysophagy is unclear. In addition, lysophagy requires the recruitment
of selective autophagy receptors. My preliminary data demonstrate that i3Neurons and HeLa cells recruit the
selective autophagy receptor p62. p62 has an established role in starvation-induced autophagy, but the role of
p62 in lysophagy remains unclear. p62 is suggested to sequester cytotoxic material from the cytosol through the
formation of liquid-like condensates. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that p62 condensates can
incorporate autophagy machinery. Thus, p62 condensates may facilitate lysophagy by increasing the local
concentration of autophagy proteins. However, the significance of p62 condensates in selective autophagy has
not been demonstrated. I hypothesize that lysophagy is tightly controlled, first negatively regulated by the
ESCRT-associated DUB AMSH and second, positively regulated by the autophagy receptor p62. In Aim 1, I will
investigate the role AMSH and the repair phase in the regulation of lysophagy in i3Neurons and HeLa cells. I will
do this using quantitative live-cell imaging as well as cell-free in vitro experiments. In Aim 2, I will investigate the
role of p62 in both HeLa cells and i3Neurons, using immunocytochemistry and super-resolution microscopy. My
goal is to investigate conserved mechanisms within lysosomal quality control. Successful completion of these
specific aims will identify mechanisms of lysophagy. Defining mechanisms of lysophagy will provide essential
insight into our understanding of lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease, providing crucial targets
for therapies to treat neurodegenerative disease."

Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is a common human pathogen that can cause an array of inflammatory diseases such
as meningo-encephalitis, myocarditis and pancreatitis. CVB has strong tropism to the pancreas and as such is
a leading cause of viral pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can sometimes be severe, which leads to systemic
inflammation, damage to other organs and death in 10-30% of patients. Children are at higher risk for lethal CVB
pancreatitis. CVB can also cause chronic pancreatitis, which is a persistent inflammation of the pancreas that is
a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Treatments for severe viral pancreatitis generally aim to mitigate symptoms,
however there is a lack of effective interventions that limit disease progression. In a recent study we had reported
that CVB type 3 (CVB3) infection causes mitochondrial fission with subsequent activation of mitophagy in
infected cells. We surmise that CVB3 triggers this in order to become engulfed in mitophagosomes which
become expelled from the host cell as virus-laden extracellular vesicles. Specifically blocking mitochondrial
fission or mitophagy pathways disrupts this process and attenuates infection. In recent reports, the transient
receptor potential (TRP) ion channels have been shown to influence mitochondrial dynamics. The capsaicin and
heat receptor TRPV1 can trigger mitochondrial depolarization which leads to mitochondrial fragmentation. We
have found that inhibiting TRPV1 not only prevents CVB3-induced mitochondrial fission, but also significantly
reduces infection in vitro. Similarly, activating the TRPV1 antagonist TRPM8 using menthol also greatly blunts
infection. We tested the effects of oral menthol treatments in a mouse model of pancreatic CVB3 infection and
saw that menthol blunts pancreatic damage and viral load. There is very limited data on how TRP channels
influence viral infection. Understanding how these pathways influence CVB3 infection will allow us to establish
novel antiviral treatments (such as menthol) to be used to suppress CVB3 pancreatitis as well as other CVB3-
induced diseases."

There are more than 250 million of chronic HBV carriers worldwide. Chronic HBV infection is the main cause of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is no cure for HBV. Interferon therapy gives temporary benefits only to
a subset of patients. Regardless that FDA-approved nucleos(t)ide analogs can greatly inhibit HBV replication,
chronic HBV infection is not well under control. None of the drugs works in all patients, and is able to achieve
the loss of the surface antigen (HBsAg, or HBV envelope proteins) in most cases. HBV frequently rebounds
after treatment is stopped. Mechanism of HBV infection is not fully understood, which affects treatment options.
This proposal will analyze the relationship between HBV integrant-derived RNAs (id-RNAs) coding for HBsAg
and HBV life cycle. HBV DNA integration into host genome is not considered important for HBV life cycle, and
id-RNAs are not well studied. Analyzing matching liver/HCC tissues from chronic HBV carrier humans using
RT-PCR, we found that regardless of HBV replication: id-RNAs accumulated in all tissues and represented 45-
100% of all HBV RNAs found in 60% of tissues (40% livers/80% HCCs); RNAs polyadenylated via cryptic HBV
poly(A) signal (could be integrant-derived or produced by HBV replication) were found in 60% livers/40%
HCCs, and were the most abundant HBV RNAs in 20% livers/20% HCCs; and replication-derived RNAs (rd-
RNAs) polyadenylated using conventional HBV poly(A) signal were the least abundant species in 70% of
tissues (40% livers/100% HCCs). Furthermore, analysis of selected tissues by RNA sequencing also showed
id-RNAs' abundance in most of the analyzed samples. The data suggest that id-RNAs may produce significant
fraction of HBsAg in cells bearing HBV integrants. If the same cells also support HBV replication, then a great
fraction of formed HBV virions likely will bear id-RNA-derived HBsAg (id-HBsAg) as a major component of their
envelopes. Thus, infectivity of these HBV virions, and their ability to support virus spread will mostly depend on
the properties of id-HBsAg, and not on those of HBV replication-derived HBsAg (rd-HBsAg). Thus, id-RNAs
could regulate the maintenance of chronic HBV infection, which may call for revision of the current model of
HBV infection that suggests that HBV life cycle is independent of the integration. It also became apparent that
anti-HBV drugs fail to achieve loss of serum HBsAg, because major amounts of HBsAg can be produced from
id-RNAs regardless of HBV replication. In light of our data, Aim 1 using a large set of liver/HCC tissues will find
if id-RNAs' abundance is common during chronic HBV infection. Aims 2 and 3 will (i) find if large fraction of id-
RNAs do not bear alterations in HBsAg-coding sequences, and thus can serve as sizeable source of functional
HBsAg regardless of HBV replication, (ii) analyze how 3'-end untranslated regions of id-RNAs (including the
host inserts) affect HBsAg synthesis, and (iii) find if id-HBsAg can efficiently support assembly and infectivity of
HBV virions. The proposal will advance our understanding on how id-RNAs and id-HBsAg can impact HBV life
cycle and HBV pathogenesis, and may justify id-RNAs as important targets for novel antiviral interventions."

The focus of my lab is to understand the mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-prone
DNA repeats. We are particularly interested in the mechanisms of repeat expansions that are responsible
for over fifty hereditary diseases in humans. Recent advances in long-read sequencing revealed a new
paradigm: massive genome-wide expansions of structure-prone DNA repeats in human cancers. Thus,
understanding the mechanisms responsible for large-scale repeat expansions is fundamentally important
and has broad biomedical implications.
My lab was the first to show that expandable DNA repeats stall replication fork progression in every
experimental system studied, including bacteria, yeast, and human cells. This led us to propose that
repeats can be added while replication fork escapes from a “repetitive trap”. We first confirmed this idea in
a yeast experimental system. Depending on the mode of replication fork progression through a repeat,
expansions occur by incorporation of unprocessed flaps during Okazaki fragments maturation, replicative
or post-replicative template-switching, or break-induced replication. Recently, we developed a new
experimental system to study large-scale expansions in human cells, which implicates DNA replication as
well. Repeat expansions also occur in terminally differentiated somatic cells that do not undergo DNA
replication. We have, therefore, adjusted our experimental system to study repeat expansions in non-
dividing yeast cells. Our results point to DNA nick repair as a possible mechanism.
We plan to move our research in several directions. First, we will elucidate the role of DNA nick repair in
expansions of Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) (GAA)n repeats in dividing and non-dividing yeast cells by
introducing targeted nicks with Cas9 nickases. We will establish its genetic controls and study the role of
the human FAN1 nuclease expressed in yeast. Second, we will unravel the mechanisms of large-scale
repeat expansions in human cells by conducting candidate gene analysis in a plasmid system utilizing
SV40 replication machinery. We will also study the effects of compounds that disrupt or stabilize DNA triplexes
formed by these repeats on their replication and expansion. We will further extend our studies into a different
system based on the EBNA1-dependent replication which involves regular cellular replication fork. Third, we will
carry out structure-functional analysis of other expandable homopurine-homopyrimidine repeats, including the
(AAGGG)n repeat, which is responsible for cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome
(CANVAS), the (CCCTCT)n repeat that modifies the expressivity of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), and
the (GAAA)n repeat, which recurrently expands in many human cancers. At present, there are no data on DNA
structures formed by those repeats or on the mechanisms of their expansions. We will address these matters by
using the broad arsenal of methods and experimental systems developed and existing in the lab."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills approximately 1.5 million people annually. It has long
been observed that the central structure of tuberculosis, the mycobacterial granuloma,
can be extensively vascularized. However, the inciting stimulus and functional
consequences of this vascularization have not been fully examined. Using a zebrafish
mycobacterial infection model that recapitulates important aspects of human granulomas,
we found that granuloma-induced angiogenesis coincides with the generation of local
hypoxia and transcriptional induction of the canonical pro-angiogenic molecule Vegfa.
Interception of this pathway with clinically available inhibitors resulted in reduced burden,
altered immune responses, and improved outcome. We found that a specific cyclopropane
modification on the bacterial lipid trehalose dimycolate (TDM) is critical to granuloma-
induced angiogenesis. We hypothesize that this specific bacterial lipid in combination with
other secreted proteins drives or accelerates angiogenesis to the benefit of infecting
mycobacteria. We will define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic
mycobacteria promote the pro-angiogenic environment of mycobacterial granulomas to
facilitate their own growth, dissemination and survival. We defined a specific subset of
macrophages within the mycobacterial granuloma that respond to TDM, produce Vegfa,
and induce angiogenesis. We will examine how TDM drives induction of the NFAT
signaling pathway in vivo and the consequences to infection. Using single-cell sequencing,
we found that epithelioid macrophages within the tuberculous granuloma produce large
amounts of fibronectin. We will dissect how production of this ECM component influences
angiogenesis and how secreted bacterial Ag85 binding to fibronectin modulates this
response. Finally, we will assess how cell-autonomous regulation of the ApoA1 axis in
infected macrophages leads to changes in angiogenesis, lipid availability, and immune
response during mycobacterial infection. Ultimately, the modulation of host angiogenic
pathways may provide new strategies for host-directed therapies for tuberculosis."
10777394,"Overarching objective of this project is to elucidate whether and how cytochrome p450 (CYP)-derived epoxy
fatty acid metabolites (EpFAs) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-hydrolyzed EpFAs metabolites (called diol
oxylipins) in sustaining gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa barrier homeostasis and to develop the efficient therapeutic
approach against GI mucosa barrier damage. More than 80% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)/eicosanoids
are metabolized through CYP pathway and GI mucosa has the highest expression levels of CYP epoxygenase
and sEH. We found that sEH inhibition or knockout against nonsterol anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
aflatoxin B1 (AFB)-induced GI mucosa damage via strengthening mucosa barrier defense and preserving levels
of EpFAs to limit inflammation in vivo. We have developed novel sEH inhibitors with excellent pharmacokinetics
and low toxicity, including the IND approved inhibitor EC5026. This sEH inhibitor has a strong effect on blocking
inflammation, eicosanoid/cytokine storms, and NSAIDs or aflatoxin B1-induced GI mucosa damage or ulcer.
PPARγ’s anti-inflammatory activities are well-known, and EpFAs are PPARγ agonist or PPARγ is a possible
EpFAs-binding receptor. Our hypothesis is that enhancement of EpFAs via sEH inhibition is crucial in sustaining
Gl mucosa barrier for their defense and restitution to mucosa damage, and mechanistically EpFAs block NSAIDs
or AFB-induced GI mucosa injury through its binding protein/receptor - PPARγ and its mediated signaling
pathway/s to i) enhance the GI mucosa barrier defense by increasing goblet cell mucin production and enterocyte
tight junction and by enhancing mucosa restitution/regeneration by activating enterocyte progenitor cell
proliferation/migration/regeneration process, and ii) inhibit endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/mitochondrial stress, and
iii) inhibit eicosanoid/cytokine storms and inflammatory activity. We have established and used numerous novel
genetically engineered mouse models and in vitro intestinal organoids, and showed a critical role of sEH
knockout in epithelial regeneration. We proposed the following three aims: 1) to determine the independent roles
of sEH specific cell-lineage knockout compared to global sEH inhibition in strengthening intestinal mucosa barrier
defense and restitution against NSAIDS/toxin-induced GI mucosal injury using powerful Villin-Cre/sEHfl/fl, Cdh5-
Cre/sEHfl/fl and LysM-Cre/sEHfl/fl mouse models that have specific sEH knockout in intestinal epithelium,
endothelium, and macrophages, respectively; 2) to determine how sEH inhibition/knockout or EpFAs enhances
intestinal mucosa restitution/regeneration process responded to injury via activating the PPARγ-mediated
signals and regulating the key related transcriptome profile in intestinal epithelium using our novel 3xTg-iEAP
intestinal epithelial injury-healing mouse model and in vitro intestinal crypt organoids; and 3) to determine
whether the key EpFAs-binding protein - PPARγ is a central player for EpFAs or sEH inhibition to block
NSAIDs/toxin-induced GI mucosa damage and strengthen intestinal mucosal barrier defense and restitution
using both powerful PPARγ knockout mice and in vitro intestinal organoids and molecular biology approaches."

There is a growing mental health crisis in the US, with the prevalence of clinically significant psychological
distress growing while access to behavioral health services apparently worsening. There has been a
particular shortage in the availability of crisis services and inpatient beds, placing a greater burden on
emergency departments and potentially associated with higher rates of homelessness, incarceration of
persons with serious mental illness, and worse health and wellbeing. The shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds
can be tied in part to Medicaid policies that do not allow federal payment for stays in “Institutions for Mental
Diseases” (IMDs), facilities with more than 16 beds that specialize in behavioral health treatment.
Recently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created an opportunity for states to apply for
waivers to receive federal payments for stays in IMDs for adults with serious mental illness (SMI) and
children with serious emotional disturbances (SED). Eleven states have received an SMI/SED waiver, and
five are pending. The waivers have the potential to improve crisis care and outpatient mental health care,
potentially reducing emergency department use and boarding, improving the coordination of care, and
reducing suicide and suicide-related behaviors. However, it is not yet clear whether the waivers have led to
changes in services or what state implementations are most successful in improving outcomes.
This comprehensive mixed-methods study will assess the effects of removing the IMD exclusion through the
SMI waivers. The staggered waiver approval process creates a natural experiment to compare states that
implement the waiver to those that do not. Our quantitative analysis will use the Transformed Medicaid
Statistical Information System Analytic Files (TAF), a national Medicaid data set that includes information on
eligibility, enrollment, and claims related to service utilization and prescription use. Our qualitative analysis will
explore state-level factors that may contribute to changes in outcomes. In response to PAR-21-316, our
proposed study will identify policies and factors that affect access, utilization, and outcomes, using large
Medicaid claims datasets and leveraging an existing data management approach to advance our research."
10775615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adult ischemic heart injury causes significant loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) which, over time, leads to
heart failure. Developing methods to therapeutically stimulate cardiomyogenesis promises to improve the lives
and survival of these patients. However, cardiomyogenesis in the adult mammalian heart is challenging due to
the limited proliferative capacity of adult CMs. Cardiomyocyte proliferation, as determined by complete cell
division and daughter cell generation, occurs during embryogenesis and early postnatal maturation, and requires
the CMs to enter the cell cycle and progress through mitosis. However, during postnatal maturation, despite
active entrance into the cell cycle, mitosis is either bypassed or aborted, termed endoreplication, leading to
polyploidy and failure to expand CM numbers. Thus, upon ischemic injury, the mouse heart is regenerative within
the first postnatal week via proliferation of pre-existing CMs but becomes non-regenerative after the first
postnatal week due to incomplete CM division. The process and regulators that decide division versus
endoreplication in CMs are poorly understood. Their elucidation is essential to achieve successful heart
regeneration. Thus, our overarching goal is to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate CM
mitosis as a means to ultimately achieve cardiac regeneration after ischemic injury.
 To prepare for and progress through mitosis, cells undergo an extensive reorganization of cytoskeleton
to accurately guide chromosome segregation and give rise to daughter cells. We have discovered that Lmnb2,
which encodes the nuclear lamina protein Lamin B2, functions as a novel mitotic regulator, which becomes
significantly repressed during the transition of postnatal CMs to the non-regenerative state. Our preliminary data
showed that depletion of Lamin B2 blocks CM division and activates endoreplication by inhibiting reorganization
of the mitotic cytoskeleton. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Lamin B2 function in controlling the switch
from division to endoreplication during postnatal development remain elusive. Our recent work suggests that
Lmnb2 inhibition, and therefore the switch to endoreplication is regulated by the transcriptional repressors, E2F7
and E2F8. We hypothesize that repression of Lmnb2 by E2F7/8 prevents completion of mitosis in non-
regenerative CMs by inhibiting reorganization of the mitotic apparatus in cycling CMs, and therefore gain
of Lmnb2 function will promote mitotic division resulting in proliferation and heart regeneration after
ischemic injury. We propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanisms of mitotic cytoskeletal
reorganization that are mediated by Lamin B2, and its effect on adult heart regeneration after ischemic injury.
Aim 2 will assess the impact of CM-specific depletion of E2F7/8 on Lmnb2 expression and CM proliferation in
the ischemic adult heart. Our incomplete understanding of how CM division is repressed in postnatal CMs
constitutes an enormous obstacle to designing heart regeneration strategies. This research will help elucidate
the mechanistic basis of mitotic regulation at key developmental stages, and after cardiac injury."

Title: Enhancing olfactory receptor expression for biochemical studies of odorant-
receptor interactions
Our sense of smell is mediated by olfactory receptors (ORs), which are the largest family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Some ORs also function outside the nose to
coordinate important physiology; OR function has been shown to be important in kidney,
skin, prostate, and in multiple cancer tissues. Despite groundbreaking advances in
delineating the structural basis of GPCR action, ORs remain among the most
unexplored class GPCRs in terms of structure, ligand binding and activation mechanism.
This is primarily because: 1) low expression of ORs in heterologous cell lines impedes
structure-function studies and 2) we lack small molecules that can potently activate and
inhibit OR function. In the past two years, Matsunami and Vaidehi have uncovered
amino acid sequence evolution and structural properties that contribute to OR
expression. Simultaneously, Matsunami and Manglik used engineered ORs with
enhanced expression to validate new approaches to purify ORs in detergents for
structural and biochemical studies. Building on these successes, we propose to address
fundamental challenges in OR expression and ligand discovery in iterative predict-test
cycles combining novel computational methods and experimental testing with two aims.
In Aim 1, we propose to engineer mutant ORs for six human ORs to enable
overexpression of these receptors for in vitro studies and tractability for large-scale
purification in detergents. In Aim 2, we will map OR ligand binding sites and discover
new high affinity agonists and antagonists using a combination of structural modeling,
ligand docking and biochemical experiments. We will also develop approaches to
determine structures of active ORs bound to odorants and G proteins by cryo-EM. The
outcome of the proposed work will provide new foundations to interrogate OR function
and widely available computational approaches to accelerate the OR field."
10781928,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Immune checkpoint inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has demonstrated dramatic and durable
clinical benefit for patients in many cancer types and is increasingly being incorporated into standard of care
treatment regimens. However, in most tumor types, this strategy is effective only for a minority of patients. As
such, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade and
increase the proportion of patients who benefit from it. We recently used in vivo CRISPR screening in
transplantable mouse tumor models treated with antibodies targeting PD-1 to identify the RNA editing enzyme,
ADAR1, as a novel target for combination immunotherapy. In a manuscript published in Nature, we showed
that loss of ADAR1 can overcome two of the most common and challenging mechanisms of resistance to
immunotherapy: a lack of infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and the loss of
antigen presentation by the class I major histocompatibility complex on tumor cells. However, the mechanisms
by which loss of ADAR1 achieves these therapeutic goals are unclear. In Aim 1 and Aim 2 of this grant, I
propose to define these mechanisms and to elaborate general principles by which resistance to
immunotherapy can be overcome. More broadly, the identification of ADAR1 as a target for improving
responses to immunotherapy suggests that targeting other enzymes that are associated with a similar auto-
inflammatory phenotype in humans could similarly benefit patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. I
propose to test this hypothesis in Aim 3 of this grant. If successful, these results will provide a mechanistic
paradigm for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy and identify novel drug targets that trigger a similar
mechanism.

10782553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 My lab discovered that NNMT is a direct GR transcriptional target gene in TNBC. I then observed relatively
high NNMT expression in several aggressive patient-derived TNBC cell lines. NNMT consumes the universal
methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) for methylation of nicotinamide. High NNMT activity depletes SAM;
as a result, methyltransferase targets are hypomethylated in cells with high NNMT expression. NNMT-induced
DNA and histone hypomethylation have been shown to result in oncogenic gene expression in cancer cells but
NNMT mechanism of action in TNBC biology remains unclear. A link between NNMT expression and mRNA
hypomethylation has not previously been established as a mechanism contributing to cancer progression. N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant and reversible RNA modification in eukaryotes. Our collaborator Dr.
Chuan He discovered that m6A-binding proteins mediate translational regulation by altering stability and
translational efficiency of m6A-modifed mRNAs. Importantly, altered m6A mRNA methylation is implicated in the
progression of several human cancers via causing changes in post-transcriptional gene expression of cancer
pathways. To our knowledge, I am the first to characterize the m6A methylome of a patient-derived TNBC cell
line model (MDA-MB-231): ~ 7000 m6A-modified transcripts are significantly enriched for pathways involved in
cellular stress response, cell death and cell survival. In addition, I have data suggesting that NNMT activity in
the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line results in 1) reduced m6A modification of mRNAs regulating key cancer
pathways and 2) increased in vivo tumor-growth. In my dissertation research, I am testing the hypothesis that
NNMT activity in TNBC cells results in 1) reduced m6A mRNA modification associated with altered protein
expression of pathways mediating cellular stress response and 2) cancer stem cell-like traits associated with
survival, metastatic potential and increased in vivo tumor-forming capacity.
 During my postdoctoral research, I aim to test whether epitranscriptomic gene expression regulates
dynamic cellular phenotypes including adaptation to the changing microenvironment. I will first characterize the
actively transcribed genes with polymerase ChIPseq and perform whole proteome quantification with mass
spectrometry in cells exposed to distinct microenvironmental stressors (e.g. nutrient deprivation, hypoxia). I will
then determine whether differential transcription of genes correlate with protein expression in different cellular
states. If there is not a strong correlation, I will perform individual siRNA knockdown of all known m6A-
regulatory genes and determine the effect on protein expression. I will then utilize patient-derived xenograft
mouse models and the Sprague Dowley rat model of spontaneous breast cancer to determine whether the
m6A-regulatory proteins are differentially expressed in distinct tumor regions with single-cell RNA sequencing."

 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
impulsivity, hyperactivity, exceptional difficulty with paying attention, or a combination of all three. This disorder
would benefit from an individual differences approach of study using electroencephalography (EEG) due to its
heterogeneity (Franke 2019) and the fact that the basic functional deficits associated which ADHD have not been
quantified with brain activity measures, even in the general population. This project focuses on studying
individual differences in the construct of cognitive control, also known as executive function, in young adults
across the ADHD spectrum, a group that has been shown to have pre-frontal driven, cognitive control deficits.
Our group previously showed that performance on an auditory selective attention task reflects variability
in overall cognitive control, as it relies on a competitive balance between bottom-up salience of sounds (like
a crying baby) and volitional, top-down desires (like paying attention to a keynote speaker) (Choi et al, 2014).
We hypothesize that these previously observed individual differences in performance, their EEG correlates, and
other biomarkers of object-based spatial selective attention ability all reflect the spectrum of cognitive deficits in
the ADHD population. This non-invasive inquiry into the neural mechanisms of attention across the ADHD
spectrum is the one of several future inquiries into specific functions in neurodiverse populations—a newly
emphasized frontier in mental health research. In the long-term, a better understanding of cognitive profiles and
neural correlates of specific functions could point to targets for neurostimulation or biomarkers for diagnoses in
the clinic. Moreover, fundamental brain science will benefit from a departure from case-control studies, as
behavioral heterogeneity is become a bottleneck in neuroscience discovery.
 This project aligns with the larger push from the NIMH Research Domain Criteria to study specific
domains of human functioning (such as cognition) and specific constructs within them (such as attention and
language) separately. Furthermore, this project falls in line with the BRAIN initiative thrusts of monitoring neural
activity in human neuroscience while developing new data analysis tools."

This K23 award will support Dr. Florimbio, a clinician-scientist with experience researching and treating
substance use disorders, in becoming an independent researcher. Targeted research and training activities will
extend her knowledge and develop her expertise in delivering technology-driven adaptive interventions (e.g.,
smartphone app) to reduce cannabis/alcohol co-use (i.e., using both substances within a single time period
[e.g., past month], which could be during different occasions or simultaneously so drug effects overlap) among
sexual minoritized (SM) emerging adults (EAs; ages 18-25) in high-risk settings (i.e., college) where interven-
tions can be initiated. Training: Dr. Florimbio proposes a comprehensive training plan to (1) learn to identify key
components for co-use interventions for SM EA college students with involvement of the target population and
community partners, (2) acquire the essential skills and knowledge to use Sequential Multiple Assignment
Randomized Trials (SMART) to optimize adaptive interventions, and (3) learn best practices for collection and
analysis of intensive longitudinal data informing such interventions. Context: SM individuals often experience
additional stressors (e.g., minority stress, internalized sexual stigma) relative to non-minoritized individuals,
which may explain, in part, why SM EAs consume cannabis and alcohol at higher rates, have greater co-use,
and experience more consequences. Emerging adulthood is a period of increased substance use, instability,
and identity exploration, and, for about half of EAs, coincides with attending college, an environment that
connotes greater substance use risk. Efficacious interventions to reduce cannabis/alcohol co-use both for EA
college students (including those of SM identities) are lacking, with the college period being an ideal time to
address co-use in this population. Optimization of interventions to address variations in needs based on
individual factors and substance use severity is also a key next step for parsimonious delivery of interventions,
with some individuals needing a greater intervention dose or an extended dose over time. Responsive to NOT-
MD-22-012, the overall research objective is to develop and test an app-based adaptive intervention for SM EA
college students to reduce cannabis/alcohol co-use. Research Plan: The research aims include: Aim 1 which is
to develop theoretically-derived app-based intervention content via community-engaged methods with iterative
refinement of intervention components with end-user testing (4 rounds, n=5/round). Based on Aim 1 findings,
Aim 2 is to conduct a non-restricted pilot SMART with SM EA college students from multiple campuses to
assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention components. Aim 2 will inform a full-scale SMART (R01
submission) to optimize technology-driven interventions to reduce co-use among SM EA college students. Key
innovations include state-of-the-art training, co-use intervention development with people with lived experience,
and the SMART design. Optimization of adaptive interventions for SM EAs to reduce cannabis/alcohol co-use
is a critical next step and will have high impact on substance use trajectories and health."

 Millions of Americans are affected by heart and lung diseases. Mechanically assisted circulation (MAC),
including mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with ventricular assist devices (VADs), extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), is routinely implemented to treat patients
with advanced heart failure (HF) or respiratory failure or cardiac surgery. Recent data shows that
approximately 85% and 75% of patients supported with continuous flow VADs (CF-VADs) are expected to
survive 12 and 24 months, respectively, which are close to the survival rates of heart transplant patients.
ECMO use expanded rapidly over the last decade. While these device-based therapies save many patients'
lives and improve their quality of life, infections are a common postoperative complication in these patients and
are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is critical to understand the risk of infections in patients
receiving CF-VAD or ECMO support and its underlying mechanisms. Both contemporary CF-VADs and ECMO
systems are based on the rotary blood pump technology. The high-speed rotation of the impeller in a rotary
blood pump inevitably introduces a high mechanical shear stress (HMSS) on the blood cells flowing through
the pump. We believe that HMSS generated by the action of pumping in CF-VAD and ECMO therapies can
cause damage/injury to leukocytes, leading to their dysfunction which affects patients’ immune defense to
infection. Given the potential of CF-VAD and ECMO therapies for patients and the need to reduce the
significant complications associated with the devices, we propose to conduct a series of bioengineering
experiments to gain a better understanding of HMMS-induced neutrophil dysfunction. Three specific aims of
the proposed project are: (1) to characterize HMSS-induced structural, rolling/adhesion and phenotypical
alterations of neutrophils, and to establish the quantitative relationships between structural alterations of
neutrophils and HMSS over the range relevant to CF-VAD or ECMO therapies; (2) To assess phenotypical
profiles and dysfunction of leukocytes using an in vivo ovine model under low and high HMSS settings of CF-
VAD support; (3) To explore potential mechanisms of HMSS-induced neutrophil structural alterations relevant
to CF-VAD and ECMO therapies. Successful completion of this project will create new knowledge of HMSS-
induced leukocyte dysfunction associated with CF-VADs or ECMO systems. The new knowledge can be used
by engineers to develop less traumatic, next-generation biocompatible VADs and ECMO systems and by
clinicians to provide better postoperative management."

Recent studies report probabilistic associations between the early-life microbiome and various child health
outcomes (e.g., obesity, asthma), suggesting potential insights into pathogenesis and subsequent, targeted
development of preventive interventions. However, the causal role of the early-life microbiome on child health
remains unclear. Our preliminary work has applied state-of-art statistical genetics and causal inference
approaches to large genetics and microbiome data in our ECHO-supported cohorts, demonstrating: 1) host
genetic loci for airway Streptococcus across racial/ethnic populations, 2) host genetic loci for gut microbiome
and significantly enriched biological pathways (e.g., regulation of neuron development, glucuronate
interconversions), and 3) relationship of gut Bacteroides with obesity and asthma risk. Our central hypothesis
is that the genetically driven gut and upper airway microbiome in the first two years of life has a causal role in
the development of child health outcomes, such as obesity and airway outcomes. This UG3/UH3 project will
test this innovative hypothesis by applying the latest statistical genetics and epidemiological methods—e.g.,
microbiome genome-wide association study (mGWAS)— to large ECHO genetics, microbiome, and extensive
clinical and environmental data. By using ECHO core data elements, Aim 1 will generate mGWAS summary
statistics to enable researchers to examine the causal role of the early-life microbiome on child health
outcomes. For example, by using the mGWAS and Mendelian randomization approaches, we will determine
the causal role of the gut and nasal airway microbiome (during age 0-1.9 years) in the risk of developing
childhood obesity. By using specialized airway outcome data, Aim 2 will determine whether the genetically
driven gut and nasal microbiome has a causal effect on the development of asthma (and its major phenotypes)
and on lower lung function in later childhood. Aim 3 will maximize the retention of existing ECHO Cohort
Protocol (ECP) participants, with emphasis on diversity, and implement the ECP with high fidelity. (To date, in
MARC-43 Boston participants, ECP retention is 100%, with >80% data completeness.) The proposed project
will serve as a national research resource for examining the causal role of early-life microbiome in various
childhood health outcomes. Furthermore, the project will provide a robust evidence base for the future

10869971,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The overall goals of the research proposed are to verify whether inter-regional correlations in resting state
fluctuations of MRI signals (rsfMRI) reliably measure functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions, to
quantify factors that modulate rsFC derived from MRI, and to validate the neurobiological and behavioral
relevance of changes in rsFC following specific interventions. We aim to continue our studies of the functional
architecture of the sensorimotor system in non-human primates (NHPs) using multi-modal measurements of
neural activity before and after perturbations of neural circuits. We will establish how fMRI data correlate with
other metrics of connectivity obtained using optogenetic and electrophysiological techniques, and quantify
changes in neural circuits that result from specific, targeted interventions, along with their functional
consequences. These studies are important for the interpretation of fMRI studies in humans that are in
widespread use but which have not previously been properly validated. Such studies can be performed using
only invasive techniques in animals whose brain architecture resembles humans. We will use high resolution
(sub-millimeter) fMRI at 9.4T to assess mesoscopic scale networks within a well defined functional region of
somatosensory cortex in monkeys, where we can measure spatial patterns of resting state correlations in
cortical layers and validate their interpretation with electrophysiological signals and anatomic tracers. We will:
(1) Quantify laminar-resolved patterns of rsFC in sub-regions of S1, S2, thalamus and inter-hemispheric
regions, and compare networks engaged by vibrotactile and layer-specific microelectrode stimulation with rsFC
data. Cerebral cortex exhibits a laminar structure, but the laminar distribution of rsFC is poorly understood. We
will confirm that CBV provides more faithful metrics of fine-scale connectivity than BOLD: (2) Quantify effects of
selective deafferentation of inputs from (i) spinal cord (ii) thalamus, and (iii) area 3b of S1, on the patterns and
strengths of rsFC and behavior. We will show how disruption of driver inputs alters rsfMRI correlations between
regions in a layer-specific and functionally-relevant manner: (3) Identify and compare networks engaged by
optogenetic stimulation of different cell populations with rsFC data. By comparing optogenetic vs fMRI
responses for different transfection viruses we can assess the relative contributions to rsFC of selective
activation of excitatory pyramidal or inhibitory interneurons, or inhibition of excitatory neurons, locally at the S2
site and at the network level at interconnected brain regions. For each set of experiments we will acquire
rsfMRI and invasive multi-electrode measurements in the same animals to quantitatively compare different
metrics of neural activity and anatomical connections. We will also measure animal behaviors in skilled hand
use to identify specific effects of changes in rsFC after intervention and with recovery. We believe that the
proposed studies have considerable importance for validating the neural basis of resting state functional
connectivity measures, and have direct implications for human fMRI studies and their applications."

 Racial disparities in US incarceration rates are greatest among emerging adults (ages 18-25), and trauma
exposure is nearly universal in incarcerated populations. Given the striking overrepresentation of Black and
Hispanic Americans in the US criminal legal system for substance use offenses, and high prevalence of cannabis
and other illicit drug use among incarcerated populations, research is needed to further understanding of the
relationship between trauma and the course of cannabis and other drug use from adolescence (ages 12-17) to
early mid-adulthood (ages 33-42) and to highlight critical intervention opportunities. We recognize the
disproportionate burden of childhood adversities and violence exposures among Black and Hispanic groups, yet
few studies have considered racial and ethnic differences in associations between childhood adversity and
substance use. Furthermore, virtually no research has examined disparities in adult trauma exposures and
substance use, and their relevance to incarceration. Addressing the aforementioned gaps, this study investigates
race and ethnicity differences in trauma exposures during an understudied developmental period, emerging
adulthood, and how trauma may influence risk for incarceration through cannabis and other drug use. This
secondary analysis study leverages data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health) and integrates a lifecourse approach into an ecological framework to examine trauma exposures
found prevalent in minoritized communities (community violence exposure and intimate partner violence).
 Our first aim is to examine race and ethnicity differences in longitudinal associations between adult trauma,
cannabis and other drug use, and incarceration, accounting for childhood adversity. The second aim is to
investigate race and ethnicity-specific lifecourse pathways from trauma exposure to incarceration. We innovate
by employing propensity scoring methods and marginal structural modeling to determine causal and cumulative
effects of adult trauma exposures on incarceration risk, setting us apart from extant trauma research that
concentrates primarily on childhood adversities. Our third aim will use moderated causal mediation to identify
salient race and ethnicity-specific social supports (adult mentorship, faith-based engagement, mental health
service use) within the neighborhood environment that most strongly attenuate effects of trauma on cannabis
and other drug use and, ultimately, incarceration risk. The objectives of this project are directly relevant to NIDA’s
Racial Equity Initiative to improve minority health and reduce inequities the US. Findings from this epidemiologic
study will be used for translation to prevention science and have great potential to inform meaningful
development of culturally-tailored and developmentally-appropriate multilevel interventions in US subpopulations
at elevated risk for incarceration. Doing so can help prevent young people’s further entrenchment in the criminal
legal system and alleviate the harmful consequences of mass incarceration on families and in their communities."

The COVID-19 pandemic has left potentially millions of individuals with ongoing symptoms months after
initial infection by SARS-CoV-2, a syndrome called post-acute sequalae of COVID-19, or PASC. A common
and often-debilitating core symptom of PASC is colloquially known as ""brain fog,"" which involves disruption
in cognitive control or the ability to maintain focus and attention especially in the presence of distraction.
Our project is based in the fact that the key cognitive control hub, the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC),
is also uniquely sensitive to systemic inflammation, which several studies have reported in PASC. By using
dual MR-PET neuroimaging during a cognitive control task, we will operationalize and objectively measure
the brain fog symptom, and test the potential contribution of microglial activation and metabolite
concentrations to this symptom. The multi-source interference task (MSIT) is a well-validated cognitive
control task that reliably activates the aMCC when administered during fMRI. We will recruit 11 individuals
with World Health Organization defined PASC who also fulfill at least one criterion from each cluster of the
myalgic encephalomyelitis International Consensus Criteria, and 11 COVID-recovered healthy matched
controls. All participants will complete the MSIT task during MRI-PET (magnetic resonance imaging -
positron emission tomography) neuroimaging. Functional MRI will be conducted during performance of the
MSIT task. We expect the fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to be larger and more
intense in PASC than control aMCC. At an individual level, we will locate the voxel within aMCC that is most
activated (peak voxel) during MSIT, and we will use this region of interest (ROI) to extract data from the
other neuroimaging modalities acquired by the MR-PET scanner. Using the [11C]PBR28 radioligand, we
expect to find increased microglial activation within the aMCC ROI in PASC versus controls. Furthermore,
using a whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequence, we expect to find increased
concentration of inflammation-linked chemical metabolites within that same ROI. By using these
complimentary techniques, we will create an objective measure of brain fog, and will create a more detailed
mechanistic understanding of its cause."

In recent decades multiple high-profile clinical trials have provided a rigorous evidence base for the
care of patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Yet many patients still
do not receive these evidence-based treatments proven to save lives. The overarching goal of our
research program is to address this issue by defining the relationship between ICU organizational
behavior and evidence-uptake in critical care. Drawing off the rapidly evolving fields of organizational
psychology, decision science, and biomedical informatics, we will broadly investigate the ways in
which the interactive behaviors of the ICU team members can both facilitate and hinder efficient
translation of evidence into practice. We will pursue three integrated and complimentary lines of
research: (1) developing and refining novel strategies for measuring critical care performance; (2)
investigating the role of collective intelligence and transactive memory as key sociological mediators
of evidence-uptake in critical care; and (3) improving the value of novel decisional support tools such
as checklists and electronic prompting for the use of evidence-based practice. To perform this
research we will leverage existing collaborations with state and regional health systems as well as the
expertise of the principal investigator, a physician-scientist with over 15 years’ experience studying
the link between ICU organization and outcome for patients with critical illness. Together, our results
will provide hospitals and clinicians with innovative tools for improving critical care performance on a
national scale, directly leading improved outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure and other

Among people living with HIV (PLWH), hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common coinfection that contributes to high
rates of liver-related mortality. Even with early initiation of antiretroviral therapies that include HBV-active
nucleoside analogs (NA), mortality in people with HBV/HIV coinfection remains unacceptably high. There is a
strong rationale for additional HBV therapies for people with HBV/HIV infection. The HBV cure research agenda
is to (1) understand HBV biology, particularly the mechanisms that lead to HBV functional cure (FC), which is
defined as seroclearance of the hepatitis B surface antigen in blood, and (2) to evaluate novel antiviral and/or
immunotherapies that can increase HBV FC from its current rate of ~1% per year. However, at the present,
PLWH are poorly represented in HBV cure research, and HIV infection is an exclusion criterion in virtually all
clinical trials of novel HBV therapeutics. To accelerate the use of novel therapies in patients with HBV/HIV
coinfection, a better understanding is needed of host control of HBV in the setting of HIV. This project focuses
on cellular immune mechanisms of HBV control, particularly HBV-specific T cells. Our central hypothesis is that
in HBV/HIV coinfection, CD4 T cells represent a critical component of the immune response mediating HBV
control, including FC. This hypothesis will be tested through 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the
impact of HIV coinfection-associated immune dysregulation, especially CD4 depletion, on the quantity and
quality of HBV-specific T cell responses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the T-cell responses mediating HBV FC in
patients with HBV/HIV coinfection who are treated during inactive HBV infection (i.e., low HBV DNA, normal ALT,
no-minimal liver disease). In this group, we previously reported relatively high rates of HBV FC. In Aim 3, we will
characterize the evolution of HBV-specific T cell responses and the intrahepatic immune landscape during adult
acute HBV infection that typically results in HBV FC, with and without HIV coinfection. The above scientific
investigation will occur within a unique HBV clinical cohort in Zambia (Southern Africa), which includes adult
patients with chronic and acute HBV infection, with and without HIV coinfection, and features longitudinal large
volume blood and liver sampling before and during NA therapy. To date HBV FC has been ascertained >40
times in the cohort, mainly in participants with HBV/HIV coinfection. Successful completion of this project will
change the field by identifying immune mediators associated with HBV FC in HBV/HIV coinfection and by defining
specific immunological barriers to HBV FC in PLWH. It also will help to identify patient groups with coinfection
who may be more or less amenable to cure with emerging drugs based on their current or nadir CD4 and current
level of HBV control. In-depth analysis of specific CD4 T cells and the intrahepatic immune milieu will also be
highly significant in our understanding of chronic HBV infection without HIV."

Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among aging people with HIV (PWH) and prostate cancer
is now one of the most common cancers among PWH. Despite this, prostate cancer remains the least studied
tumor in terms of its natural history and clinical outcomes in the context of HIV. Our findings suggest that HIV
infection is associated with rapid carcinogenesis, increased adverse treatment events, and elevated mortality
risk. However, there are very limited data on the impact of HIV on treatment selection (versus active surveillance)
on key short- and long-term outcomes, including cancer control, quality of life, and mortality particularly for PWH
with clinically localized prostate cancer (the most commonly diagnosed stage). These include tradeoffs in toxicity
profiles and oncologic control among therapeutic modalities, as well as competing risks of death from non-cancer
causes. Quantifying the downstream harms and benefits of different management strategies for localized
prostate cancers is critical to aid decision-making, maximize treatment benefits, and reduce harms. Despite
compelling need, treatment of localized prostate cancer has never been investigated in the context of HIV in
clinical trials, and extrapolating results from clinical trials in HIV uninfected persons is inappropriate due to
differences in treatment complications and tolerability. Furthermore, unique HIV-related factors may substantially
alter prostate cancer natural history, comorbidities, functional status, risk of second primary cancers, life
expectancy, and quality of life. This project will determine the role of HIV on localized prostate cancer natural
history and outcomes. We will synthesize a disease simulation that will be used to perform comparative
assessment of common treatment pathways to guide treatment decision-making. Our Specific Aims are: (1) To
evaluate the impact of immune dysfunction and specific ART regimens on a) active surveillance (AS) for low-risk
disease, and definitive treatment for intermediate- and high-risk disease and b) outcomes and adverse treatment
events for all stages of prostate cancer among PWH; (2) To create and validate a microsimulation model (HIv
Prostate Treatment [HIPR-T]) of prostate cancer natural history and treatment outcomes for localized prostate
cancer in PWH; and (3) To use the HIPR-T model to compare the benefits vs harms of optimized AS and
definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer over the lifetime of PWH. To achieve these aims, we will use
data from large, representative HIV/cancer cohorts (>3,000 PWH prostate cancer survivors) and a validated HIV
natural history simulation framework. We will synthesize and validate a novel prostate cancer-HIV simulation
model capturing AS, treatment initiation and definitive therapy outcomes. Then, we will use the enhanced model
to assess the optimal management of PWH with localized prostate cancer that will maximize survival and quality
of life. The findings from this study will transform the clinical decision-making process for early-stage prostate
cancer, maximize benefits and reduce harms, reduce uncertainties and treatment disparities, and will inform
treatment recommendations for managing prostate cancer among PWH."

Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting 1 in 50,000 in the U.S. FA-
related heart failure is the predominant cause of premature mortality. There is no approved treatment. At the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Center for Excellence (COE) in FA, we provide care for >400
children and adults with FA. We have found that decreased aerobic capacity, specifically low maximal oxygen
uptake (VO2max) with exercise, is common, and reflects disease progression. Low VO2max is likely related to
decreased insulin sensitivity (Si) that often progresses to diabetes. VO2max also predicts capacity to perform
activities of daily living. We propose that in the absence of FA-related heart failure, deficits in skeletal muscle
metabolism contribute most to decreased VO2max in FA. FA is caused by mutations in the gene encoding
frataxin (FXN), which impacts mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity. We have found a
52% deficit in muscle OXPHOS in FA that is related to reduced insulin sensitivity. Low muscle OXPHOS has
been identified as a potentially reversible contributor to decreased functional status in individuals with heart
failure from causes other than FA. Therefore, we posit that improving muscle OXPHOS and aerobic capacity
may also attenuate symptoms in FA. There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the best ways to
improve VO2max in FA prior to the onset of heart failure. Exercise is the most potent known stimulus to
increase muscle mass, OXPHOS, and glucose tolerance. One adaptation to exercise is an increase in muscle
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a cofactor required for ATP production. NAD+ precursors are called
“exercise mimetics”, because they increase muscle OXPHOS, endurance, and glucose tolerance even in
sedentary animals. In cardiac- and skeletal muscle FXN knock-out animals, NAD+ precursors rescued cardiac
function to near-normal. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a currently available NAD+ precursor that is safe and
well-tolerated. We propose a randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design testing 12 wks of
exercise and NR in FA. Individuals with FA (N=72, ages 10y-40y, without heart failure or DM requiring insulin)
will be recruited from our cohort and from an FA registry. They will be randomized to 1 of 4 arms: exercise+NR,
exercise alone, NR alone, or control. We will quantify changes in muscle mass, NAD+, and FXN, and use a
novel strategy that will complement ex vivo measures of mitochondrial respiration with direct in vivo imaging of
skeletal muscle OXPHOS. We will assess changes in aerobic capacity (VO2max) and glucose metabolism (Si).
For both outcomes, we expect that exercise+NR will produce larger changes than exercise alone, and that
changes will be mediated by increases in muscle NAD+ and OXPHOS. With insights from this initial study of
skeletal muscle metabolism and aerobic capacity in individuals without heart failure, we will next pursue trials
to improve functional status in individuals with FA both with and without heart failure. These pathobiological
mechanisms may also be relevant for increasing functional status in heart failure from other causes."

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major limiting complication of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation for the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma and certain solid tumors. aGVHD occurs when T
lymphocytes from donor bone marrow attack cells within the recipient that are critical to the function vital
organs, namely skin, liver and gut. During the past three decades of research, Dr. Murphy’s laboratory has
found that in skin and squamous mucosae, the first sites of effector-target cell interaction provoked by
differences in minor histocompatibility antigens, involve T cells bearing Vb-specific markers that home
selectively to epithelial rete ridges as well as the epithelial stem cell-rich bulge regions of murine hair follicles.
This association results in death by apoptosis of adjacent epithelial cells that express the stem cell marker,
cytokeratin 15. Systemic therapeutic inhibition of these effector limbs is riddled with problems that include
collateral impact on immune reconstitution and blunting of graft-versus-tumor effects. However, we now know
through discoveries made in collaboration with co-PIs of this proposal, Drs. Markus and Natasha Frank, that
the skin and squamous mucosae harbor intrinsic cellular pathways capable of potent immunosuppression.
Specifically, we have discovered a dermal dendritic cell that has stem cell characteristics, expresses the
multidrug resistance transporter ABCB5, and also expresses PD-1. This cell has the ability to thwart T cell
responses, including alloreactivity, and therefore holds significant but as yet unexplored promise as a skin-
intrinsic pathway that may be leveraged to inhibit the tissue injury in aGVHD. In this proposal, Dr. Murphy and
the Drs. Frank have combined forces to address the long-term objective of harnessing the skin’s intrinsic
immunosuppressive capabilities to thwart aGVHD. The proposal’s specific objective is to determine the impact
of PD-1-expressing immunosuppressive dermal mesenchymal stem cells on the earliest and most specific
effector-target cell interactions responsible for aGVHD. To this end, we have proposed three specific aims:
1) to correlate spatiotemporal multiplex immune profiling with all aspects of disease morbidity and recovery
in aGVHD; 2) to dissect ABCB5 dermal stem cell function in aGVHD and define PD-1/PD-L1-centered
strategies for skin-intrinsic immunosuppression; and 3) to apply ABCB5+ dermal stem cell transplant
strategies to influence aGVHD severity using spatiotemporal multiplex immune profiling as effector-target
bioassay. The approaches involve state-of-the-art multiplex immunophenotyping of effector-target cell
interactions that sensitively and specifically typify tissue injury in aGVHD, and leverage ABCB5 gene knockout
and lineage tracing models in context of PD-L1 Ig administration and ABCB5+ stem cell engraftment. The
rationale is that upon successful completion of this work, we will identify novel therapeutic approaches to the
treatment and prevention of aGVHD skin and squamous mucosal pathology through manipulation of skin-
intrinsic immunosuppressive pathways."

This
molecular
most
 is a proposal to use fetal-derived exosomes isolated non-invasively from maternal blood as a source of
biomarkers that predict whether an at-risk fetus will be born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the
involved end of the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ( FASD), or one of the partial forms . Prenatal alcohol
exposure is the most common cause of intellectual disability in the US. Other features of FAS include small eyes,
face, and brain, as well as neurobehavioral deficits. These syndromes are not readily detected early in pregnancy
with available imaging techniques, but early diagnosis could facilitate development of therapeutic interventions.
We previously studied banked human fetal brains and eyes at 9-22 weeks' gestation paired with maternal blood
samples from pregnancies affected by maternal alcohol use (assessed by self-report) compared with non-
exposed controls and demonstrated high correlations between altered expression of several protein, RNA and
apoptotic signaling molecular markers and morphometric abnormalities consistent with FAS, such as reduced
eye diameter and brain size. The molecular abnormalities were detectable in fetal brain-derived exosomes (FB-
E) isolated from the maternal blood. Now, we propose a follow-up clinical study to determine whether these
biomarkers will predict the postnatal emergence of FAS/FASD. In collaboration with the Department of OB/GYN
and the Section of Neonatology at Temple University Hospital, FB-E will be isolated from maternal blood and
analyzed for protein, RNA, and apoptotic markers throughout the pregnancy, and correlated with morphological
observations to detect features of FAS/D (small eye globes, small head circumference, longer upper lip, absent
philtrum, etc.) in newborn infants, with follow-up pediatric exams for 2 years. We will compare findings in 150
EtOH-exposed pregnancies with 75 unexposed pregnancies, controlling for infant sex, maternal obesity, age,
race/socioeconomic status, and tobacco use, and excluding cases in which the mother used other substances
of abuse, to determine which biomarkers are most predictive of FAS/FASD in at risk newborns. Pregnant women
will fill out a standard survey about their use of alcohol, and cell-type specific (oligodendrocyte, neuronal,
microglial, astroglial, synaptic) FB-Es will be isolated from their blood. The molecular contents of these exosomes
will be assayed for biomarkers, particularly ones associated with dysmyelination, e.g., MBP, reductions of which
showed the most consistent correlation with alcohol-associated reductions in eye diameter in our previous
studies. The findings will be correlated with morphological abnormalities characteristic for FAS/D in neonates. If
it works in FAS/D, this approach might be useful to predict other disorders of neurological development."

Spinal cord circuits are the final step in motor computations and are a site where descending signals are
integrated with sensory cues to drive motor behavior. Eleven cardinal spinal interneuron types have been
identified with distinct developmental origins, neurotransmitter phenotypes, and ipsi- versus contra-lateral
connections. Elegant genetic approaches have targeted these cardinal interneurons revealing roles in motor
control, but understanding of how spinal neural networks comprised of heterogenous cells from multiple cardinal
domains function together to control features such as precision, coordination, and automaticity of motor
behaviors remains unclear. This grant focuses on a recent discovery (Osseward et al., Science 2021) that each
cardinal interneuron population is profoundly divided into genetically-distinct local and long-range neurons (1).
The goal of this grant is to determine if these local/long range divisions of cardinal neurons correspond to distinct
circuit modules for motor control.
 Transcriptomic profiling revealed a code spanning each cardinal interneuron domain in which medially-located
neurons with short range connections are marked by NeuroD2 (called N-type) and laterally-located cells with
long range projections express Zfhx3 (called Z-type). Here this proposal will test whether these N/Z-markers
define functional neural units for controlling coherent features of motor behavior by comparing the connectivity,
function, and neural-activity of N-type and Z-type cells within two distinct cardinal interneuron populations:
inhibitory V1 and excitatory V2a neurons. This grant hypothesizes that long range Z-type neurons have critical
functions related to “broadcasting” motor commands across multiple spinal segments to facilitate dexterity and
interlimb coordination, whereas N-type neurons process local information for rapid reflexes and L/R limb control.
Although inhibitory-V1 and excitatory-V2a interneurons are physiologically different, this grant explores the
possibility that the N- versus Z-cell types from each cardinal class may have related functions that transcend
even their neurotransmitter status. By defining the foundational organizational features of motor circuits, these
studies may reveal a higher logic for how circuit modules are constructed with different cardinal neuron types.
 To explore the innovative hypothesis that functional units span cardinal cell types, a novel set of mouse
intersectional genetic tools for labeling/targeting the N/Z divisions of the V1 and V2a neurons was generated. A
new method for multi-electrode in vivo neuronal recording of spinal neurons in behaving animals was also
established. Aim 1 (outputs) and Aim 2 (inputs) will define V1- and V2a-N/Z connections to understand the
anatomical similarities and differences of N/Z-neurons within two distinct cardinal populations. Aim 3 will perturb
the function of V1- and V2a-N/Z subtypes to understand their role in motor behavior. Aim 4 will record the neural
activity of V1- and V2a-N/Z subtypes during motor behavior to determine whether their activity is linked to specific
motor functions. These studies aim to reveal entirely new organizational features of spinal motor circuitry."

The avascular cornea is innervated by a dense network of sensory processes derived from the ophthalmic and
maxillary regions of the trigeminal ganglion. Corneal nerves provide not only mechanical, chemical, and thermal
sensitivity to the front of the eye but also release nutrients and trophic factors that supply the cornea. Structural
and functional nerve abnormalities are the hallmarks of neurotrophic keratopathy, a degenerative disease
associated with impaired corneal healing and ulceration. These abnormatilies can also be observed in other
conditions known to cause corneal damage, such as dry eye. Most therapeutic approaches aimed to promote
corneal nerve regeneration focus on providing neurotrophic support. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved the use of recombinant nerve growth factor eye drops for the treatment of
neurotrophic keratopathy, but its use has been associated with several adverse effects and limitations.
 This proposal centers on a major gap in our understanding of the inhibitory mechanisms hampering corneal
nerve regeneration, which could prove important to develop new strategies to promote functional reinnervation.
Research during the last decade has consistently found increased levels of the carbohydrate-binding protein
galectin-3 in the tear fluid and corneal epithelium of patients with ocular surface disease. Importantly, the areas
where increased galectin-3 expression has been observed coincide with the location of intraepithelial nerve
terminals and the basal nerve plexus. It is become increasingly clear that multimerization of galectin-3 leads to
cross-linking of carbohydrate ligands and the formation of lattice-like structures on plasma membranes essential
for regulating cell survival or degeneration. We hypothesize that overabundance of galectin-3 promotes
degenerative signaling by interacting with specific surface receptors in peripheral sensory neurons and may
constitute an important therapeutic target for the full recovery of nerve sensation in corneal disease.
 The following specific aims will address this objective: (1) to examine the role of galectin-3 in modulating
neurotrophic signaling, (2) to determine the impact of galectin-3 on the neural mechanisms underlying corneal
disease, and (3) to investigate whether whether therapeutic inhibition of galectin-3 improves corneal nerve
regeneration and sensation. It is anticipated that the successful conclusion of this project will reveal a novel
mechanism by which galectin-3 regulates neurotrophic signaling in corneal nerves. Results could potentially
advance the field of corneal nerve regeneration by targeting the pathological actions of galectin-3 and lead to
the development of novel therapies to promote functional innervation."
10781661,"Project Title: Therapeutic Role of NFAT1 Transcription Factor in Osteoarthritis
Project Summary
 Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease in middle-aged and older populations. Traditionally,
OA is classified into primary (spontaneous/idiopathic) and secondary (induced by joint injury or abnormal joint
formation) OA. Since age is the overriding risk factor for OA and loss of articular cartilage (AC) occurs in the
load-bearing area of OA joints, OA has long been considered a mechanical issue resulting from the “wear and
tear” of AC over time. Recent studies suggest that all the joint tissues may be involved in the disease process,
though AC degeneration is the major hallmark of OA. Currently, no pharmacologic therapy is available to halt or
reverse the process of joint aging and OA due to unknown regulatory mechanisms underlying the OA changes.
NFAT1 is a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor family. Our recent
studies showed that mice with a global deletion of the Nfat1 gene (Nfat1-/- mice) displayed normal skeletal
formation but manifested OA in adult mice. Lower AC NFAT1 levels correlated with earlier onset and more severe
OA changes in Nfat1-deficient mice. Age-related reduction of NFAT1 expression in the joint tissues was also
observed in normal mice after 12 months of age, with age-related cell dysfunction. Our preliminary human studies
revealed that higher AC NFAT1 levels correlated with less severe radiographic OA grades, and vice versa. The
data suggest the protective potential of NFAT1 against OA progression. The objective of this proposal is to
investigate the therapeutic role of NFAT1 treatment in joint aging and OA development using OA mouse models
and human joint-tissues with primary OA. Specific Aim 1 is to investigate the therapeutic role of AAV-Nfat1
(adeno-associated virus/AAV delivered Nfat1 transgene) in knee OA mouse models. Specific Aim 2 is to
determine the therapeutic role of NFAT1 in human cartilage and synovium tissue samples with primary OA.
Positive results of this preclinical project will promote the development of a personalized OA therapy in patients
with significantly reduced NFAT1 expression or biological activities."

Numerous brain disorders and diseases are caused by deficits in synapse function. Synaptic
transmission is traditionally thought to be governed by the amount of neurotransmitter released and the
number of neurotransmitter receptors localized to the postsynaptic membrane. However, accumulating
evidence suggests synaptic function not only depends on the number of postsynaptic receptors, but also
their precise nanoscale positioning within the postsynaptic membrane. For example, at excitatory
synapses AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) form one or more clustered sub-structures within
the postsynaptic density that are precisely aligned with presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites.
Modeling studies predict this pre/post alignment to be critical for efficient AMPAR activation, but this has
been challenging to address experimentally. The degree to which receptor nano-positioning influences
synaptic function remains unclear due to a lack of suitable approaches for 1. Rapid and reversible
perturbations to synaptic nanostructure that allow simultaneous synaptic function measurements. 2.
Probing glutamate concentrations directly within distinct synaptic nanodomains. 3. Testing the functional
relationship between receptor activation and distance from neurotransmitter release sites. To address
these issues, we have recently developed new approaches for rapidly manipulating postsynaptic
scaffolds and receptors in real time. In parallel we have developed a new set of genetically encoded
affinity reagents for labeling and manipulating endogenous AMPARs. We propose to combine these
approaches to assess the functional relevance and regulation of nano-scale positioning within the PSD, a
problem that has been challenging to assess using conventional approaches."
10780775,"AI2Equity: AI Integrating SDOH Data to Advance Health Equity in Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
Abstract
Disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk exist among racial/ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic
groups, where social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural social factors substantially contribute. The
underlying clinical, social, and intersectional structural factors are interconnected and complex. However, most
risk prediction models do not account for these factors and their complex interactions with clinical factors.
Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been applied to this important problem, but most are limited in
terms of equity, SDOH integration, methodology advancement, interpretability enhancement, and generalizability.
To address these limitations, we will build an AI-powered, equitable, interpretable, actionable, and
generalizable CVD risk model to inform social and clinical interventions and reduce disparities among
racial/ethnic minorities and socially disadvantaged populations. With experts in AI/ML, clinical primary care,
SDOH and health equity, and biostatistics, our multidisciplinary team is well-suited to carry out this important
and timely study. We will apply advanced deep learning ML approaches to predict CVD risk and identify social
and clinical risk factors in diverse patient populations from one national community health center research
network (OCHIN) and two academic hospitals. First, we will develop a social-ecological AI model to improve
health equity (AI2Equity) in CVD risk prediction by integrating clinical factors and multi-domain, multi-level social
and structural factors into an advanced deep learning architecture (Aim 1). Second, we will enhance the
AI2Equity model’s fairness and interpretability through algorithmic optimization, explainable AI, and qualitative
study (Aim 2). Third, we will assess and improve AI2Equity’s generalizability across multiple healthcare
systems/settings and simulate its effectiveness compared to traditional CVD risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This
project provides a solid foundation for future clinical trials involving CVD prevention. The study aligns with NIH’s
commitment to “Leveraging the potential of AI/ML to accelerate the pace of biomedical innovation while
prioritizing and addressing health disparities and inequities.” Clinical decision support powered by AI2Equity,
leveraging social and clinical factors and their interactions, can better guide resources, promote health equity,
and steer multi-component interventions (e.g., clinical intervention, social support, and policy changes) in CVD
prevention. It will allow for more equitable CVD prevention interventions in racial/ethnic minorities and
socially disadvantaged groups and has the potential to reduce disparities."
10774867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Mammalian models of cancer have been instrumental in the development of many targeted
therapies. It is, however, difficult to establish these models, such as patient-derived cell cultures (PDCC) and
xenografts (PDX). As a result, most cancer types have only a limited number of models available, which do not
accurately reflect the diversity of human cancer in real life.
Innovation: The majority of the patient-derived models were developed using untreated primary samples with
plenty of tumor tissue. The next challenge in tumor modeling will require much more difficult samples, such as
minute residual tumor foci in a patient with a partial chemotherapy response. Even though cancer is a disease
of unchecked cell growth in the body, normal cells paradoxically proliferate faster than malignant cells in cell
culture. As a result, in the majority of PDCC models, the cancer cells eventually disappear. To address the issue
of normal cell overgrowth, we are creating a tumor-specific medium (TSM) that suppresses normal cell
proliferation.
Preliminary data: As a proof-of-concept, we published twenty-five new ovarian cancer cell (OvCa) lines that
retained the molecular, histologic, and outcome features of the patient tumors.
Objectives: Our goal is to create innovative and simple culture methods that enable the creation of patient-
derived cell cultures and PDX models and develop best practices for validating these models.
Specific Aims: We are working on five major solid tumor types (lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and ovary) and
a liquid tumor (leukemia) to illustrate that our system can be adapted to culture the full spectrum of tumor types.
Aim 1: Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived lung, breast, prostate,
kidney, and ovary adenocarcinoma cultures and compare their molecular profiles with the original patient tumor.
Aim 2) Patient-Derived Culture of Solid Tumors: We will establish patient-derived AML cultures and compare
their molecular and phenotypic profiles with the original patient tumor.
Research Strategy: We will compare the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of each cell line with the original
patient tumor, existing cell lines, and tumor datasets.
Innovation: By suppressing the expansion of normal stromal cells and normal epithelium, the TSM culture
system can maintain cancer cell lines long-term without feeder layers, drugs, or extracts.
Impact: Predicting drug activity in the clinic has always been difficult using traditional cultural models. Therefore,
having access to biologically relevant lung, breast, prostate, kidney, ovary, and AML cell lines could revolutionize
cancer drug development."
10781955,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 To reliably encode information about the environment, neurons must modify their activity profiles and even
connectivity to accurately interpret complex stimuli. Cortical feedback projections to the olfactory bulb are
uniquely positioned at the interface between detection-based processing that is driven by sensory input and
analytical processing occurring in the piriform cortex. This arrangement makes these projections an ideal target
to study how learning reshapes neuronal activity profiles. I have developed an approach that will allow for a
comprehensive analysis of the axonal activity of principal neurons in the piriform cortex, while mice learn a task
requiring them to identify a specific odor embedded in complex mixtures, thereby providing unique insight into
olfactory scene analysis. My approach will also provide a detailed analysis of the connectivity between cortical
axons and their postsynaptic targets in the olfactory bulb, which will reveal how the olfactory bulb integrates
processed information from the piriform cortex. The hypothesis I will test is that learning reshapes cortico-fugal
input to the olfactory bulb, leading to enhanced odor-scene segmentation through the disambiguation of
olfactory bulb output neuron activity profiles. The outcomes of these studies will provide novel insight to how
the brain to updates its stimulus-encoding scheme from a synthetic to analytical representation of a stimulus
environment. The studies proposed here are novel technically as well as conceptually, and the results will be
broadly applicable to other sensory systems. In Aim 1, I will characterize how learning shapes the activity of
cortical feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. Aim 2 will determine how the synaptic strength and number
of cortical inputs to individual olfactory modules are updated during learning. Finally, Aim 3 will determine how
cortical input shapes the activity profiles of bulbar output neurons. The training phase of this award will be
conducted at Harvard University in the laboratories of Prof. Venkatesh Murthy and Prof. Naoshige Uchida.
Together with my mentors and advisory committee, I have developed a comprehensive training plan that will
provide me with new technical skills and provide professional development that will enable my successful
transition to an independent investigator. The completion of this project will provide the basis for future
experiments related to learning-mediated plasticity in the olfactory system and other sensory systems."
10781956,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Ae. aegypti in nature differs dramatically in its vector competence for viruses (the permissiveness of the mosquito
to become infected and to then transmit the virus). Successful transmission of a virus critically depends on its
ability to overcome infection and escape barriers imposed by co-infecting pathogens or co-habiting symbionts in
the mosquito. Viruses are obligate parasites and therefore, must compete for resources (or nutrients) primarily
at the initial site of replication, the midgut. Thus, they induce significant changes in the mosquito metabolic
environment to benefit viral replicative needs. The metabolic environment (referred to as the metabolome) can
be precisely measured and directly linked to the level of replication and transmission and thus exploited to control
these events. In this project we will determine if manipulating the metabolic environment of the mosquito can
interfere with the success of viral replication by creating metabolic choke-points that limit transmission of the
virus from the vector. We will also evaluate how Wolbachia (an endosymbiont that has the ability to block virus
transmission) might compete for or limit metabolic resources required for virus replication and if this `pathogen-
blocking' phenotype is dependent on its density within the mosquito. We will also identify if and how viruses will
counter the effects of Wolbachia or other metabolic interference to develop resistance or escape metabolic
pressure. Through this work, we will identify how the metabolic environment of the vector can be exploited (by
natural or artificial means) to create refractory environments for viral replication and transmission. This work will
also provide a foundation for developing associations between metabolic reprogramming and other important
vector phenotypes, such as insecticide resistance, populations structure and geographic distribution, and general
mosquito biology, all of which are major determinants of vectorial capacity and pathogen transmission."
10932243,"ABSTRACT
The North American overdose crisis remains at epidemic levels, with over 1 million lives
lost over the past decade. This crisis is primarily driven by the emergence of high-
potency opioids such as fentanyl, in unregulated (“street”) drug markets. However, the
volatility of these markets has also led to the emergence of other even more potent
opioids such as carfentanil and nitazene-class opioids, along with adulterants such as
benzodiazepines. These emerging drug threats produce complex overdose
presentations and difficulties in overdose reversal, all of which contribute to overdose
mortality. Drug checking services, which provide individuals with analytic information
regarding the presence of compounds in drugs of unknown composition, are increasingly
employed in North America to prevent overdose mortality during the era of high-potency
synthetic opioid contamination. However, current efforts to implement and expand
access to drug checking services are hampered, primarily because current available
technologies have logistical, technical, and cost-related barriers that impede their
feasibility as point-of-care interventions. This is exacerbated by the need for ongoing
assay development to ensure that drug checking technologies can continue to
accurately detect and identify novel high-potency drug threats in North American drug
markets. Meeting these needs is critical to advance the effectiveness of drug checking at
the population level, particularly for drug checking service providers, individuals who use
drugs, and medical examiners undertaking forensic investigations of overdose mortality.
The aim of the current project is therefore to develop and validate a novel point-of-care
technology, known as DoseCheck, for rapid non-targeted identification of emerging drug
threats. Specifically, we will: 1) validate the DoseCheck system’s capacity to differentiate
between and within classes of opioid, stimulant, depressant, and anesthetic compounds
in non-targeted analyses of unregulated drugs; 2) undertake timed exercises to evaluate
the capacity of our team to rapidly adapt the DoseCheck system to detect and
differentiate a novel emerging drug threat; and 3) test the capacity of the DoseCheck
system to identify and differentiate distinct opioid metabolites within human biomatrices.
Achieving these aims will generate high impact and highly translational findings that will
support the expansion of adaptive, analytically sophisticated, and low-cost point-of-care
drug checking services and thereby contribute to a reduction in overdose mortality."

Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders. Patients with epilepsy experience
recurrent seizures that can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from auras to loss of
consciousness. Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal firing of large numbers of neurons and
current therapeutic agents cannot control seizures in 25% of all epileptic patients. We have
previously shown that a novel brain stimulation method targeting fiber tracts (fornix) instead of
grey matter at low frequency (1-20Hz) is effective to suppress seizures in animal models and
patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We propose to target another prominent
fiber tract, the corpus callosum (CC) to suppress cortical seizures and to compare this
technology to two state-the-art methods that stimulate at high frequency either the focus
directly or the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Specifically, we propose to determine if
stimulation of the CC at low frequency can decrease focal seizures by selectively activating the
CC fibers innervating the focus in an acute model (Aim 1) or in focal chronic model of epilepsy
with tetanus toxin (Aim 2). We then propose to determine if fiber tract stimulation can improve
seizure control of activity generated by multiple foci compared to stimulation of the anterior
nucleus of the thalamus (Aim3) or with kainic acid in chronic model (Aim4). Finally, we will study
the mechanisms of the CC stimulation using in-vitro cortical brain slices obtained from animals in
previous aims. The project will be carried with a collaboration between scientists, engineers and
clinicians and if successful could be translated into a novel patient-specific therapeutic modality
for the control of cortical seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy."
10760273,"Strabismus can be both visually and socially debilitating and its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms
remain poorly understood. Current treatments often do not restore full visual function and do not address the
underlying pathology. Strabismus has a clear hereditary component, but precise genetic mechanisms have not
been defined. We recently identified three rare, recurrent genetic duplications that increase risk of esotropia.
Each of these duplications includes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which are often involved in chromatin
remodeling and regulation of gene expression. Duplications can also affect gene expression by insertion of
regulatory elements in new locations or disruption of the 3D chromatin structure. We therefore hypothesize that
regulation of gene expression is an important mechanism underlying strabismus. This is bolstered by the
findings that known environmental risk factors for strabismus, including prematurity, maternal smoking, and low
birth weight, affect epigenetic regulation through changes in methylation. This proposal aims to (1) define the
consequences of these duplications on gene expression, chromatin structure, and neuronal morphology and
function, (2) evaluate esotropic and exotropic patients for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or small insertions
or deletions (indels) in the genes and regulatory regions included in the duplications or affected by the
duplications, and (3) identify additional genetic causes of strabismus through whole genome sequencing of
large strabismus families. The precise breakpoints and insertion points of the duplications will be determined
by long-read whole genome sequencing, then each duplication will be introduced into induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) through CRISMERE (a variant of CRISPR/cas9). Gene expression, enhancer activity, and
chromatin conformation will be compared between stem cells, neuroprogenitors, and differentiated neurons
with and without each duplication. The effects of each duplication on neuronal morphology and function will be
assessed. Fluidigm multiplexing and next-generation sequencing will allow cost-effective screening of our large
strabismus cohort for SNVs and indels in the coding and regulatory regions of the genes included in the
duplications, as well as genes whose expression is altered by the duplications. Variants identified in multiple
individuals and predicted to be damaging bioinformatically will be evaluated with in vitro functional studies.
Additional families with multiple members with strabismus will be enrolled, and coding, non-coding, and
structural variants will be identified through whole genome sequencing. Variants will be prioritized based on
linkage, bioinformatic predictions, and population frequency. In addition, the epigenetic and 3D interactome
maps from neuroprogenitors and neurons will be used to prioritize variants. Functional studies will be done on
high priority identified variants. This work, by identifying genes and signaling pathways that contribute to
development of strabismus, will provide insights into strabismus pathogenesis, which will allow development of
new strabismus treatments or preventative interventions based on the underlying pathophysiology."

The vision of the Rocky Mountain Center for Occupational and Environmental Health (RMCOEH) is to be the
leading center in the world in meeting current and future occupational and environmental health and safety
challenges, thereby protecting workers and their environments. RMCOEH will achieve this through
interdisciplinary education, research, and service, as stated in its mission.
RMCOEH has six established programs that have produced 761 graduates and will continue to support the
center’s goals (Ergonomics & Safety, Industrial Hygiene, Occupational Medicine Residency, Occupational
Injury Prevention Research Training, Targeted Research Training, and Pilot Projects Research Training). The
center’s Continuing Education program, meanwhile, has trained more than 15,000 workers in the preceding
five years and impacts more than 3,000 businesses annually, and our Outreach program touches hundreds of
thousands of people. RMCOEH intends to advance the training and impact of each of these programs,
producing a diverse group of graduates and trainees that is equipped to meet the interdisciplinary needs of
Health and Human Services Region 8 and to carry out the center’s vision and mission.
Further, RMCOEH is proposing the addition of a new graduate certificate program for which there is major
demand in Region 8: Occupational Health Nursing. This program will elevate RMCOEH’s impact to even
greater heights and serve as a pipeline for employers that are in desperate need of occupational health nurses,
ultimately ensuring workers are safer and receive better care in the event of an injury or illness.
RMCOEH’s research efforts currently include 44+ current extramural projects with $30.8M in funding. These
are crucial to the center’s success in the coming grant period. They will continue to bolster the center’s mission
and contribute to the knowledge base of occupational and environmental health and safety issues. An example
of RMCOEH’s ability to perform research that has immediate, real-world impact is its leadership role in
groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine efficacy studies that provided key information for the pandemic response.
The center’s existing programs, the addition of an Occupational Health Nursing graduate certificate program,
and a continuing focus on research will allow RMCOEH to continue serving a vital role in occupational and
environmental health and safety in Region 8. We are eager to advance our efforts in the coming five years and
aim to make an even larger impact on the lives of workers and their environment."

The Center for Innovation in Point-of-Care Technologies for HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious
Diseases at Northwestern (C-THAN) proposes to remain a member in the Point-of-Care Technologies
Research Network (POCTRN) as a Technology Research and Development Center (TRDC). C-THAN will
catalyze innovation in diagnostic technologies through a model that enhances complementary strengths to
build multidisciplinary partnerships across technology platforms, clinical, regulatory and commercialization
domains with a specific focus on HIV/AIDS and emerging infectious diseases in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). The C-THAN structure will incorporate clinical, and user needs in the development process
while providing expertise and resources to address early barriers to technologic development, validation, and
commercialization. The scope of work entails: 1) assessment of unmet clinical needs in POC testing for
HIV/AIDS, its co-morbidities, and emerging infectious diseases; 2) develop relevant solicitation topics to
address unmet clinical needs; 3) award and manage sub-award projects made by C-THAN; 4) collaborate with
relevant scientists, physicians, researchers and engineers; 5) develop essential technical, clinical, industrial
and regulatory partnerships; 6) conduct clinical studies and/or provide access to specimens for validation
testing of prototype devices; and 7) create training opportunities for technical developers and other
stakeholders related to the development of POC and home-based devices. The range of technologies will
include POC devices for detection of infection and monitoring of HIV/AIDS and its common potentially fatal co-
morbidities including tuberculosis (TB), non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C
(HCV) and HIV-associated malignancies. Furthermore, emerging, and re-emerging infectious diseases will be
addressed by applying our strategy of addressing the urgent diagnostic need of POC testing for SARS-CoV-2
and other emerging infections such as mpox virus, Ebola, Lassa Fever, and Rift Valley Fever, among others.
The United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) has set the ambitious goal of achieving a 95%
detection rate for HIV, placing 95% of those individuals on treatment, and achieving 95% viral suppression in
those that are treated. The major premise of this renewal proposal is that these goals will not be met without
augmenting the current diagnostic platforms for HIV, its co-morbidities, and emerging infectious diseases with
POCs that are affordable, rapid, and easy to use in LMICs requiring minimal skill and maintenance. An
emphasis will be directed to specific technologic domains by establishing four working groups (WG) in
molecular, lateral flow, synthetic biology, and product engineering. We will leverage the dynamic and
productive collaborations established by Northwestern in Africa at nine academic centers in Nigeria, Mali,
Senegal, Tanzania, and South Africa."
10891712,"Project Summary / Abstract
 HIV remains a major public health concern in the United States. The proportions of people with HIV (PWH)
in 2020 who knew their HIV status, were linked to care, retained in clinical care (50%), and had suppressed
viral loads (57%), were lackluster. Retention in clinical care is a core quality-of-care indicator and the central
stage of the HIV care continuum. Suboptimal clinical retention is strongly associated with virologic failure while
on ART, high-risk behavior, and poorer survival. Furthermore, it is estimated that 43% of new HIV
transmissions are from PWH who are out of care (the largest proportion from any one care continuum stage).
The implication, echoed in multiple public health policies over the past decade, is that high retention and
engagement in clinical care are critical for blunting the HIV-related morbidity and mortality and reducing the
number of new HIV infections.
 However, despite consensus that “retention” in care is critical and “engagement” in care must be increased,
we do not fully understand how best to measure retention and engagement among patients in high-income
settings, particularly in the modern ART era and given changes in care delivery that were introduced during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier research indicated that sicker patients (i.e., those with lower CD4) were more
likely to miss clinic visits. More recent work, though, found that patients attending clinic visits less frequently
may continue to receive laboratory monitoring services; this could well be an indication that healthier patients
(i.e., those with higher CD4) who are stably virally suppressed are compliant with newer monitoring guidelines
which demand less frequent clinic visits. However, the field has yet to delineate the optimal frequency of clinic
visits for these healthier, virally suppressed patients as opposed to individuals in multiple other risk strata,
though applying a single metric regardless of sub-population could produce spurious findings of poor retention
among clinically stable individuals. In this respect, our proposal is truly novel.
 The proposed research will therefore extract, harmonize, and analyze readily available data on clinical care
patterns within the largest HIV cohort in North America: the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on
Research and Design. We will use these data to describe patterns of retention and engagement (Aim 1),
isolate multiple measures of care receipt (Aims 1 and 2) that predict improved survival and viral suppression,
and assess multiple methods for stratifying populations while quantifying the expected causal impact of
improved retention on HIV outcomes under existing and novel, optimized metrics (Aim 3). The public health
impact of improved retention metrics, based on population-specific HIV clinical care engagement, would be
profound, particularly in light of changes in HIV disease and comorbidity clinical management and laboratory
monitoring under a primary care model, as well as changing care modalities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This proposal therefore holds unique promise, enabling improved HIV care continuum measurement in the US."

P20 planning grant; in our proposed U54 these two boards will be joined by our newly created CAB and DEI.
The inclusion of these two new boards underscores our U54’s commitment to 1) serving the diverse individuals
that live in our Southern California communities and 2) to mentor and train a diverse early-stage investigators
who are committed to eliminating our current disparities in cancer therapeutics, drug development, and access
to clinical trials. Through the activities and oversight of the PEC, our four advisory boards will 1) conduct
evaluation, tracking, and reporting of the progress of projects and cores and 2) provide focused feedback to
program U54 leadership and investigators. As in our P20 planning grant, the U54 PEC will work with the IAB to
provide a structured and rigorous review process to select new Full and Pilot projects as well as Mini-Pilots for
the Capacity Core. The PEC will assess all components of our U54 partnership. The PEC will assure that the
1) Research and Evaluation Core training and education programs are effective in providing education and
building capacity, 2) Outreach Core works with investigators to be inclusive of the communities we serve, and 3)
Capacity Core identifies provides early-stage investigators (ESI) with mentorship in target identification, drug
development, and clinical trials. We anticipate that together our Cores will play a key role in developing future
U54 projects that build UCR’s capacity in drug development and clinical trials."
10761751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by the spread and
aggregation of the protein tau. Tau aggregates or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) accumulate throughout the brain
of patients and lead to dementia. No effective treatments currently exist for tauopathies. Those approaches that
have been considered, such as tau antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides, directly target tau. The complexity
of tau cell biology, however, makes this approach challenging. A completely novel approach is to take advantage
of the tau spreading pathway. The spread of NFTs correlate with disease progression and is a likely mediator
for the observed neurotoxicity. Recently, we identified a cellular receptor, LRP1 (Low-density lipoprotein
Receptor-related Protein 1), that regulates the tau spread pathway. Knockdown of LRP1 prevents tau spread
in human iPS neurons and the mouse brain, suggesting that the tau-LRP1 interaction could be an important
entry point for disease intervention. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to identify small-molecule
chemical probes that prevent the binding of tau to LRP1, with the hypothesis that these molecules would serve
as key starting points for novel therapeutics. In preliminary work, we have identified the primary interaction
surface for tau on LRP1 and have developed a TR-FRET high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify
compounds that can disrupt this interaction. We have optimized the assay to 1536-well format and conducted a
pilot screen of 5,000 compounds with excellent performance, Z'~0.7 and a hit rate of ~0.4%. Analysis of the 20
hits from this screen in primary, artifact, and orthogonal assays identified several compounds with modest
potency in dose response. To fully develop this work, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will use the TR-FRET
assay to screen a 420,000 chemical library and, in parallel, conduct an affinity screen of a 4.4-billion-
member DNA encoded library leveraging the DELopen platform (WuXi AppTec). In Aim 2, we will narrow our hit
selection using orthogonal and novel biochemical profiling assays to determine mechanism of action. Finally, in
Aim 3 we will validate hits with advanced biophysical and cell-based assays. We expect our multi-pronged
approach will identify multiple chemical series with different mechanisms of action. Subsequent hit expansion
efforts will produce chemical probes with properties suitable to test our hypothesis that small molecule LRP1-tau
inhibitors can prevent tau uptake and spread. In future studies we intend to develop these probes into drugs that
prevent tau spreading in tauopathies such as AD. As the critical path testing funnel is in place, we anticipate we
can rapidly obtain and evaluate selective in vitro hits, explore their activity, and ultimately their suitability as
starting points for hit-to-lead studies and for future in vivo evaluation in animal models and eventually patients."
10761753,"Project Summary/Abstract:
With over 300,000 new cases per year and a mortality rate of approximately 50%, oral cancer is a major global health
issue. The stage at diagnosis is the most important predictor of survival, and unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed
at a late stage. Oral cancer is preceded by visible mucosal changes which are designated oral potentially malignant
disorders (OPMD). Invasive biopsy of oral lesions is the gold standard to diagnose oral dysplasia and cancer, and
pathologic diagnosis of dysplasia is the best indicator of risk for oral cancer development. Dysplasia often arises in
patients with OPMDs; however, most practitioners lack expertise to distinguish OPMDs from benign lesions. It is difficult
even for experts to determine which oral lesions are at highest risk to contain dysplasia and should be biopsied. The goal
of this proposal is to develop and validate an Active Biopsy Guidance (ABG) optical imaging system, consisting of an
optical mapping scope and a high resolution microscope, to help clinicians determine precisely when and where to
biopsy suspicious oral lesions. The ABG system will integrate several optical imaging modalities to non-invasively probe
key molecular and morphologic changes associated with the next-generation hallmarks of cancer.
In Aim 1, we will develop a compact optical mapping scope that uses Digital Light Processing technology to capture
white light and auto-fluorescence images and actively project onto the oral mucosa a map highlighting areas at high risk
for oral dysplasia and cancer based on loss of collagen fluorescence (a signal of invasion and metastasis) and alterations
in epithelial NAD(P)H and FAD fluorescence (a signal of de-regulated cellular energetics). The mapping scope will
function as the first step in the image guidance sequence, projecting a visible map of high-risk regions on the oral tissue.
We will develop tracking algorithms to adjust the projected map to ensure accurate positioning despite patient
movement. In Aim 2, we will develop a low-cost fluorescence and reflectance high resolution microscope capable of
imaging nuclear morphology in the oral epithelium (a signal of sustained proliferative signaling, genome instability and
mutation) and microvascular density and morphology (a signal of angiogenesis). The high resolution probe will serve as a
confirmation modality to improve specificity. In Aim 3, we will integrate the optical mapping scope and high resolution
microscope into a single, compact Active Biopsy Guidance system and validate its ability to provide real-time precise
guidance for selection of oral biopsy sites in a study of high-risk patients undergoing surveillance for oral cancer.
Combining widefield autofluorescence imaging and high resolution imaging of nuclear and microvessel morphology will
provide a biologically directed approach to help clinicians precisely determine where and when to biopsy suspicious oral
lesions, achieving both high sensitivity and high specificity.
The impact of this research will be to provide interactive imaging technology that will enable earlier detection of oral
neoplasia and better patient outcomes addressing a long-standing, significant global health challenge."
10929461,"SUMMARY
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that
effects 200,000 people worldwide. Despite discovery of the gene more than 25 years ago and more than 150
clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment for HD. The development of any therapy that slows, halts, or
prevents disease would have a major impact on the patients and their families. HD is caused by the expansion
of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT), resulting in an expanded stretch of glutamines in the huntingtin
protein. Normal huntingtin protein (HTT) is essential throughout the body and brain to regulate cell physiology
including synaptic transmission and neuroprotection, cell division and differentiation, gene transcription and the
DNA damage response. In patients with HD, the expanded polyglutamine tract causes mutant HTT (mHTT) to
fold abnormally, resulting in aberrant post-translational modifications and cleavage to generate toxic mHTT
fragments. The N-terminal mHTT fragments form oligomers that interact with many cellular proteins, disrupting
cell function, resulting in increased levels of mHTT and causing mHTT inclusions. Substantial neuronal
dysfunction and death occur in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and the cerebral cortex. Experimental
procedures that lower mHTT have reversed disease symptoms in animal models of HD. However, clinical
translation of this mechanism of action has stalled and is, in part, hypothesized to be due to nonselective lowering
of both the essential HTT as well as mHTT. In addition, some of the drug candidates in clinical trials target the
brain exclusively, use therapeutic modalities that require invasive delivery systems and leave the rest of the body
untreated. Therefore, an orally delivered, systemically distributed, brain-penetrant therapeutic that selectively
eliminates toxic mHTT while sparing the functional forms of HTT to support normal physiology could offer an
effective treatment for all HD patients. By applying its expertise in screening, Origami Therapeutics (OT) has
identified a chemical scaffold, represented by OR1-113, that prevents mHTT aggregation, and selectively lowers
mHTT levels in cell-based assays by enhancing degradation through an autophagy pathway as demonstrated
in HD patient-derived fibroblasts, human HD iPSC-derived medium spiny neurons and in vivo in the cortex and
striatum of the YAC128 mouse model of HD. Twelve analogues of ORI-113 have been designed. The efficacy
and drug-like properties of OR1-113 and 12 analogues will be compared in HD patient iPSC-derived MSNs and
in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies will provide insight regarding the metabolism
and potential interactions of the drug compounds (Aim 1). Pharmacokinetic (PK) and brain exposure profiles of
four lead compounds selected from Aim 1 will be determined in mice for oral availability (Aim 2). The top two
ranked leads will be evaluated in a combined PK/Pharmacodynamic and safety study in YAC128 mice with oral
administration (Aim 3). These studies will identify a lead therapeutic drug candidate that will move into
Investigational New Drug Application studies that are required prior to initiation of clinical testing."

Therapeutic advances have doubled life expectancy for many people living with cystic fibrosis (PLWCF), yet
multisystem symptom burden (e.g., pain, dyspnea, fatigue) continues to impair quality of life. Evidence also
suggests that quality of life and mortality in CF are influenced by social determinants of health and race. The
goal of this observational study is to identify overlapping biopsychosocial drivers of symptom experience in
PLWCF. Specific Aim 1: We will use patient-reported outcomes to identify clusters of co-occurring, plausibly
interrelated symptoms in 140 adults with CF. We will also determine the extent to which social determinants of
health interrelate with symptom clusters to form clinically meaningful phenotypes of CF symptom experience.
Specific Aim 2: We will perform untargeted metabolomic analysis of plasma and exhaled breath condensate to
identify metabolic signatures (e.g. inflammation and oxidative stress) and clustering techniques to propose
metabolic endotypes and determine their relationships with symptom clusters and phenotypes. Specific Aim 3:
We will use sequential mixed methods incorporating surveys and interviews to identify PLWCF experience of
CF clinical care and relationships between symptom clusters, social determinants of health, and care
experience. Cumulatively, these complementary yet independent approaches will create a robust, person-
centered understanding of CF symptoms, their correlates and interactions, and their effect on quality of life.
The expected outcome of this research is identification of new, actionable targets for interventions to prevent or
reduce symptoms at the biological, clinical, and systems levels."

The burden of urinary incontinence (UI) on American women is immense in human and financial terms, and
continues to rise with the growing population of older adults. The goal of this proposal is to improve the care for
UI provided to women and, in doing so, decrease the utilization of specialty care while improving patient
outcomes. Specific Aim 1 seeks to improve the quality of incontinence care provided to an ethnically diverse
population of women through a controlled practice-based intervention involving primary care providers. The
intervention involved the implementation of PCOR measures. Three Southern California medical groups will
participate in a cluster randomized controlled trial in which 60 offices (20 per site) will be randomized to undergo
a practice-based incontinence intervention led by a ”clinical champion dyad” comprised of a primary care provider
and urologist/urogynecologist, both of whom are members of that specific medical group. The intervention will
include physician education, individual performance feedback, electronic decision support, patient education
using dedicated advanced practice providers (APPs), and the implementation of an electronic referral service.
The quality of patient care, as evidenced by compliance with the quality indicators, will be measured across the
two randomized arms after implementation of the intervention. The investigators for this proposal recently
developed and pilot-tested a set of quality-of-care indicators (QIs) for urinary incontinence that encompass
primary care for UI. Compliance with these quality indicators will be the key means to implement PCOR evidence,
while, at the same time, measure quality. In addition, in Specific Aim 2, utilization of specialists will be compared
before and after the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that improved care at the level of the primary
care physician will reduce the number of specialty referrals. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will seek to measure the effect
of the intervention on patient outcomes. Under the hypothesis that a practice-based intervention will improve
disease-specific outcomes, symptom severity, quality of life, and patient knowledge will be measured at baseline
using validated questionnaires. After implementation of the intervention, these questionnaires will be given a
second time six months later and outcomes will be compared between control and intervention groups. We
expect that this intervention will also reduce disparities in care for underrepresented minorities."

Lytic infection, and the failure to replicate, in response to epithelial differentiation is important to EBV pathogenesis in the nasopharynx for several reasons. EBV lytic genes promote cancer mechanisms including genome instability and the production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, virus shed from lytic infection replenishes the local reservoir. Intriguingly, IgA antibodies to EBV lytic proteins are elevated in NPC patients sometimes rising years prior to the onset of NPC. The nasopharyngeal epithelium is composed of many cell types which are broadly divided into stratified epithelia and pseudostratified respiratory epithelia. The assortment of cell types in these epithelial tissues cannot be studied in 2-D culture. This gap has made it challenging to elucidate EBV molecular pathogenesis in the nasopharyngeal epithelium with any clarity. One transformative approach is the use of 3-D cell culture models. In this proposal, we demonstrate with different types of nasopharyngeal air-liquid interface (ALI) 3-D cell culture models that the EBV protein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), is required for lytic induction through induced expression of the immediate-early gene (BZLF1) encoding Zebra. In this application, we will use a HK1 EBV-infected cell line reactivated in ALI culture (known as HK1-EBV ALI), and a second [de novo EBV infection] model in which primary nasopharyngeal cells are seeded in organotypic rafts (referred as nasal-rafts). Both these 3-D culture models are highly permissive in terms of lytic potential. We focus on redefining LMP1 as a virulence factor required for lytic induction, which revises the current paradigm acknowledging LMP1 as an EBV oncoprotein. The removal or inhibition of LMP1 in HK1-EBV ALI or in nasal-rafts, blunts Zebra induction. Conversely, the introduced expression of LMP1 in HK1-EBV cells produces a differentiation-dependent superlytic phenotype. Strikingly, LMP1 is one of the most divergent EBV- encoded genes but is highly conserved in NPC tumors, yet the functional significance of LMP1 sequence variation in relation to lytic infection is completely unknown. We show evidence that the LMP1 interactome is completely rewired during lytic infection. We hypothesize that LMP1 sequence variation impacts Zebra induction and this response would be dependent on the differential activation of differentiation-dependent transcription factors (TF). In this proposal, we seek to define LMP1’s mechanisms involved in the induction of Zebra through activation or induced expression of TFs in three Aims. In one Aim, we will study how LMP1 sequence variation impacts LMP1 functional genomics in relation to Zebra induction. In the other two Aims, we will use a combination of protein array and single cell RNA-sequencing methods to elucidate differentiation-dependent and LMP1-induced TFs that activate Zebra expression. This proposal is expected to shed light on the significance of LMP1 sequence evolution in regard to lytic potential and to define how rewiring of LMP1 mechanisms during lytic infection redefines LMP1 as a virulence factor."

Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) remove synaptically released glutamate and maintain extracellular
glutamate concentrations below neurotoxic levels. Particularly the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 plays a
major role in glutamate clearance in synaptic clefts. Removal of excess cellular glutamate is strongly implicated
as a clinically relevant means to treat neurodegenerative diseases where excitotoxicity due to excess glutamate
contributes to neuronal injury and death.
We have designed a unique research program to understand the molecular mechanisms of allosteric modulation
of glutamate transporters by recently discovered small-compound molecules, including long-sought activators of
transport. To reach this goal, we will obtain and integrate multidisciplinary knowledge of the transport function,
3D structures, and single-molecule dynamics of the transporters and their complexes with the allosteric
compounds. In turn, this knowledge will aid understanding the basic membrane transport mechanisms of the
most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain.
We will pursue the following aims:
Aim 1: Elucidate the molecular determinants within the human EAATs that are important for allosteric
modulator activity. We will use functional studies and computational approaches to define the allosteric site
within EAAT2 that mediate the effects of the compounds.
Aim 2: Determine the structures of human EAATs in complex with allosteric modulators. We will determine
the three-dimensional structures of EAATs in complex with positive and negative allosteric modulators to unravel
the atomic details of their coordination.
Aim 3: Establish whether allosteric modulators modulate the function of EAATs though altering the rates
of conformational transitions underlying transport. We will examine the conformational dynamics and its
modulation by allosteric modulators using single-molecule FRET and other spectroscopic techniques and couple
these studies with single-vesicle/single-transporter assays to determine the effects of allosteric modulators on
turnover rates and the timing of transport cycles.
IMPACT: Information generated in this research program will open new avenues for drug discovery as these
transporters serve as important drug targets for many severe debilitating CNS conditions, such as traumatic
brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, ALS and neuropathic pain, that collectively affect nearly 5% of the American
population."

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in aging and has a
profoundly negative effect on speech comprehension, leading to increased social isolation, reduced quality of
life, and increased risk for the development of dementia in older adulthood. Typical audiological tests and
interventions, which focus on measuring and restoring audibility, do not explain the full range of cognitive
difficulties that adults with hearing loss experience in speech comprehension. For example, adults with SNHL
have to work disproportionally harder to decode acoustically degraded speech. That additional effort is thought
to diminish shared executive and attentional resources for higher-level language processes, impacting
subsequent comprehension and memory, even when speech is completely intelligible. This phenomenon has
been referred to as listening effort (LE). There is a growing understanding that these cognitive factors are a
critical and often “hidden effect” of hearing loss. At the same time, the effects of LE on the neural mechanisms
of language processing and memory in SNHL are currently not well understood. In order to develop evidence-
based assessments and interventions to improve comprehension and memory in SNHL, it is critical that we
elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of LE and its consequences for speech comprehension. In this
project, we adopt a multi-method approach, combining methods from clinical audiology, psycholinguistics, and
cognitive neuroscience to address this gap of knowledge. Specifically, we adopt a novel and innovative method
of co-registering pupillometry (a reliable physiological measure of LE) and language-related event-related brain
potential (ERP) measures during real-time speech processing to characterize the effects of acoustic challenge
and LE on high-level language processes (e.g., semantic retrieval, syntactic integration) and subsequent
speech memory in older adults with SNHL. This innovative work addresses a time-sensitive gap in the
literature regarding the identification of objective and reliable markers of specific neurocognitive processes
impacted by acoustic challenge and LE in age-related SNHL."

The continued and inevitable emergence of antibiotic resistance demands a vigorous and sustained
effort to identify fundamentally new targets and strategies for innovative antimicrobial therapeutics.
Antibiotic-resistant enterococci are major causes of hospital-acquired infections. Enterococci are
successful hospital-acquired pathogens in part because of their intrinsic resistance to commonly used
antibiotics that target the bacterial cell envelope, such as cephalosporins. However, many questions
remain regarding the genetic and biochemical basis for cephalosporin resistance in enterococci.
Previous work revealed key roles for two signal transduction systems - the IreK transmembrane
kinase and the CroS/R two-component system - in regulation of cephalosporin resistance, but the
downstream effectors in the signaling pathways that drive cephalosporin resistance remain unknown.
In preliminary studies we showed that two penicillin-binding proteins – enzymes that synthesize
peptidoglycan – are each essential for cephalosporin resistance, yet are functionally distinct from
each other. The mechanisms by which the activity of these penicillin-binding proteins are regulated in
enterococci are unknown, although current models point to the possibility that these penicillin-binding
proteins exist as components of multiprotein peptidoglycan synthase complexes. Our data suggest
that the IreK and CroS/R signaling systems are responsible for regulation of penicillin-binding protein
activity to promote cephalosporin resistance. The major knowledge gaps to be addressed are that (i)
the composition and activity of the peptidoglycan synthases in response to cephalosporin stress are
unknown; (ii) a definitive link between IreK or CroS/R and the peptidoglycan synthases has not been
established; and (iii) the mechanisms by which cephalosporins induce lethality when one
peptidoglycan synthase is impaired is unknown. The research proposed here is designed to elucidate
new insights into the roles and regulation of peptidoglycan synthases in the biological processes that
drive enterococcal cephalosporin resistance. By doing so, we will provide new insights into the
fundamental biological processes that drive key antibiotic resistance in enterococci and define new
targets for innovative therapeutics designed to impair enterococcal cephalosporin resistance."

 Clinical events and hospitalization can be physically disabling, especially for older adults because of their
reduced physiological reserve. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired
disability in older adults, and many patients fail to remediate losses in physical functional capacity. To correct
these disabling effects, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) was established with exercise training as its foundation.
Moderate intensity continuous aerobic training (MICT) and moderate intensity resistance training (MIRT) are
core components of CR designed to improve functional capacity, with peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) the
primary metric used to gauge its effectiveness. Despite clear functional and survival benefits of MICT+MIRT
training, some groups of patients who enroll in CR receive less functional benefit. Attention has focused on
high intensity interval aerobic training (HIIT) as an alternative intervention because it yields greater
improvements in VO2peak compared to MICT. However, neither of these aerobic training protocols address
skeletal muscle size and weakness that occur with aging, are exacerbated by hospitalization and limit exercise-
induced physical functional gains in older adults. While guidelines include MIRT in standard CR exercise
programs, it has minimal effects to remediate fundamental deficits in muscle size and contractility in older
adults. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for innovative, multi-modal exercise interventions to optimize
gains in VO2peak and physical function with CR exercise that address specific limitations found in older adult
patients. Building on our strong published and preliminary data, the current proposal addresses this need by
testing the efficacy of combined HIIT+ high intensity resistance training (HIRT) to improve VO2peak and physical
function in patients eligible for CR compared to standard of care MICT+MIRT. We hypothesize that HIIT+HIRT
will promote greater functional improvements due to greater gains in skeletal muscle fiber size and function. To
test this hypothesis, we will evaluate patients eligible for CR using a rigorous, RCT design, with a sub-set of
patients undergoing assessments to examine the effects of each training program at the organ, tissue, and
cellular levels to define mediators of the benefits of exercise on functional capacity. Successful completion of
the proposed studies would challenge current clinical practice and advance a novel multi-modal CR exercise
paradigm to optimize improvement in VO2peak, physical function and clinical outcomes in older adults and
generate foundational knowledge of the mechanisms whereby these exercise modalities modulate function
capacity. Demonstration of the efficacy of HIIT+HIRT within CR, the largest, structured clinical rehabilitation
program that serves older adults, would provide a strong impetus to broaden the use of high intensity exercise
paradigms among healthy, older adults and patient populations."
