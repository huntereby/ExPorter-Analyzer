We propose to continue our existing NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center (Laboratory for Early Psychosis or LEAP
Center). Although coordinated specialty care (CSC) is standard of care for patients with first episode psychosis
(FEP), there remain gaps in our knowledge base regarding selection and deployment of treatments. The LEAP
Center has been addressing these gaps through development of a statewide CSC clinic system in
Massachusetts, standardized data collection and participation in the EPINET consortium, and adapting
methods developed outside of mental health. In the first LEAP Center period, we have generated strong
interdisciplinary collaborations between clinicians, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and FEP
experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science,
machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. In the next period, we will leverage these collaborations to
conduct a randomized clinical trial and to access diverse data sources to examine the role of specific treatment
interventions in FEP. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative
effectiveness research (CER) for FEP research. We have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2)
Clinical research; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will include four complementary projects: 1)
Project 1 is a “signature” project to conduct a cluster randomized clinical trial of enhanced CSC. 2) Project 2
will apply causal inference techniques on FEP-CAUSAL, an international data platform; 3) Project 3 will
leverage EPINET national registry data to estimate the effect of treatment exposures studied in Project 1; 4)
Project 4 will compare CSC care with non-CSC care at the state level using both electronic health record and
statewide administrative datasets. The Administrative Core and Methods Core bind these projects and the
multiple types of data (i.e., experimental data and observational data from electronic health records, national
registries, or administrative datasets) and analytic approaches together. We have a group of Scientific
Advisors, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines (e.g., those that historically have had limited mental
health research exposure), and Stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, organizational leaders, and patient and
family advocates) who will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to
continue the evolution towards a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis which started in the first
LEAP Center period and to continue to support NIMH-sponsored EPINET learning health system consortium."

The Administrative Core for the “Laboratory in Early Psychosis” Center, a.k.a. LEAP Center, will support
continued activities of the currently existing Center. This involves the research consortium of first episode
psychosis clinics in Massachusetts and an interdisciplinary team of leading researchers. The LEAP Center is
dedicated to research in first episode psychosis, including testing an intervention strategy in our consortium of
clinics in a randomized controlled trial, extensive multimodal longitudinal data collection, and prediction and
comparative effectiveness research using various clinical datasets to better understand heterogeneity in
patient outcomes and treatment impacts. The Administrative Core will serve the Center’s goals by facilitating
regular communication, fostering synergy among disciplines, supporting training opportunities and pilot
projects, disseminating information on Center activities, organizing stakeholder panels, and overseeing
evaluation of the Center itself. The Core will be led by the Center Leads Drs. Öngür, Hsu, and Hernan, and
supported by a Center Administrator. It will be housed in dedicated office space at McLean Hospital. The Core
has four aims. First, it will oversee and coordinate all activities essential to the functioning of the Center,
including maintenance of regulatory and contractual obligations, management of budgets and subcontracts,
interacting with academic, state, and federal agencies, completion of reporting requirements, supporting
regular communication between Center elements, and fostering and tracking collaborations. Second, the Core
will oversee and coordinate governance structures including the Steering, Manuscript, Data Management and
Access, Pilot Project, and Training committees within the Center. Third, it will manage the solicitation, review,
funding, monitoring, and reporting of the conduct of an average of two R03-level pilot projects each year. And
fourth, the Administrative Core will coordinate and manage engagement with a diverse array of stakeholders
including patient and family groups, national and state policy makers, payers, as well as a panel of senior
scientific experts. The Core will also support dissemination of Center activities and advances through
conferences and short courses, visiting scholar series, clinical case conferences, as well as a website. Finally,
the Administrative Core will track objective metrics of Center performance and convene annual meetings of the
Advisory Board (composed of senior investigators within and outside of psychiatry research which will conduct
assessments of Center progress and suggest refinements). Taken together, the Core activities are designed to
ensure that the LEAP Center remains a unified whole that is greater than the sum of its parts."

The Methods Core of the LEAP Center will continue to work on a data platform that integrates information
obtained at different levels of care of First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients and will develop the
computational tools that will allow Center investigators to access and analyze the integrated databases.
Specifically, the Methods Core will provide the methodological expertise for the application of state-of-the-art
machine leaning algorithms for clinical prediction, and for the application of cutting-edge causal inference
techniques for comparative effectiveness research. First, the Methods Core will provide the database
infrastructure to securely store, harmonize, link, manage, and analyze the high-dimensional databases that will
be used by Center investigators. These databases include detailed clinical, demographic, socioeconomic
information for each FEP patient, plus randomized controlled trial data, electronic health records and insurance
claims, and longitudinal datasets on clinics characteristics and services offered. Many of these data sources
have never been used for mental health research, either independently or in concert. We will create the only
U.S.-based consortium approaching a thousand FEP patients. Second, the Methods Core will ensure that
recent advances in clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research can be applied to large
databases of FEP patients and will be an incubator of methodological research in response to the
requirements of the Center projects. It will serve as a platform for a synergistic collaboration between experts
in several disciplines—psychiatry, statistics, epidemiology, and health policy—who will engage in high-impact
studies to improve the clinical outcomes of FEP patients. Our project also provides a potential model for data
consolidation and expertise sharing across multiple NIMH Alacrity P50 Centers. In summary, the Methods
Core will support the data analysis activities throughout all projects, and will disseminate methodological
advances amongst the community of mental health researchers and will therefore function as a national
resource that facilitates the use of innovative methods beyond the Center investigators."

Trial and meta-analytic evidence support early intervention after a first episode of psychosis (e.g., through coordinated
specialty care [CSC]) to improve patient outcomes, but clinics often face real-world challenges in delivering components
of this care and have difficulty retaining patients in treatment. This disconnect between the evidence suggesting CSC
efficacy and the real-world challenges lead to worse outcomes for patients that one might expect given the trial data, i.e.,
effectiveness falls below efficacy. The challenges include staffing shortages and allocation inefficiency, particularly with
smaller scale clinics. Moreover, some patients need additional services, e.g., cognitive remediation. The LEAP Center
“signature project” will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) of enhanced coordinated specialty care (CSC 2.0)
compared to standard, real-world CSC in a network of clinics in Massachusetts which together will serve as a “research
laboratory” for testing improvements to CSC. The CSC 2.0 intervention includes peer providers, digital outreach, family
groups, coordination with ED/inpatient providers/PCPs, and cognitive remediation, all organized using a centrally
managed hub-and-spoke design. We selected these components based on clinic feedback about existing fidelity
challenges and patient needs and because of their promise to improve patient engagement/retention in CSC, a critical
mechanism for improving outcomes. The trial will randomize 350 patients by clinic*month using a scheme that both will
split evenly the sample and blind clinic staff to the randomization process. The control arm consists of usual care within
the clinics, which we will track. The intervention arm uses a hub-and-spoke model deploying the intervention to all clinics,
often delivering care remotely for both clinician and patient. Because follow-up losses are most pronounced during the
first year of care, our primary outcome will be the number of months (0-12) during which the patient attended the expected
number of CSC appointments. The trial will leverage existing electronic health record data and EPINET registry data,
maximizing data collection efficiency. We have developed and refined these types of data during the first funding period.
The trial will leverage the efforts of the Administrative and Methods Cores as well as the other projects, which in turn will
complement and extend the trial capabilities. In sum, this project will provide clinicians, patients, and policy makers
rigorous experimental data on the impact of an enhanced CSC delivery approach compared with the usual care offered by
CSC clinics with all of their real-world challenges."

expectancy and highest overall rates of cancer deaths (including colorectal, breast and prostate
cancers), infant mortality, asthma, and cardiometabolic diseases (including heart disease,
hypertension and obesity). Complex diseases and environmental insults all invoke and/or
subvert host inflammation, with individual immune and variable responses to therapeutic agents
being dictated in part by genetic variants. Precision diagnoses and prognoses of individual
patient responses rely on assessing known disease and immune markers before, during and/or
after treatment. This proposal will interrogate the functional effects and druggablity of under-
studied gene variants related to immune and drug response within the genome of individuals of
African ancestry (AAs). Immune gene variants most common among AAs and predicted to be
druggable will be engineered into cells lines of different geographical ancestry and evaluated for
functional effects in vitro and/or in vivo and modeled in silico to predict structural changes to the
wild type proteins and possible variant-drug interactions. Novel assays to screen for compounds
with therapeutic potential will be developed and used for screening. Lead compound candidates
will then be validated, optimized and tested in vitro and/or in vivo. This project has the potential
to 1) establish ancestry-related host immunity as a contributing biological parameter of complex
disease disparities; 2) fill in critical knowledge gaps by identifying novel players and
mechanisms of inflammation and their role in complex disease; and, 3) possibly lead to the
development of effective therapies to address health disparities."

High-throughput molecular technologies are increasingly being used in biomedical and basic science. New tech-
nologies and assays are being developed at a rapid pace, and have the potential to interrogate cellular processes
at an unprecedented resolution and throughput. As a result of the developments in measurement technologies,
more investigators in molecular biology are in need of statistical methods to analyze complex data. We have a
track record of developing such methods and the R35 mechanism will provide us with the flexibility to pivot our
effort as new molecular approaches are being developed.
We will focus on methods for (1) measuring the shared molecular component between experiments, (2) differ-
entiation and cell cycle measurements using single-cell RNA-seq, (3) detecting selection acting on molecular
features such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and transcription factor binding, and (4) epigenomics
assays including nanopore sequencing."
10894159,"Cell sheet morphogenesis is essential for metazoan development and homeostasis of animal form – it contributes
to development, such as in gastrulation, neural tube, heart and palate formation and to homeostasis, in wound
healing. Gene expression and signaling cascades coordinate and regulate the cellular machines that drive
morphogenesis. Disfunction in these components causes developmental and wound healing defects that can
disfigure or kill. We focus on the molecular mechanisms of cell sheet morphogenesis during dorsal closure (DC)
in Drosophila melanogaster. During DC, lateral epidermal sheets advance to close a dorsal opening. We
pioneered the study of DC as a model system and use an unusually diverse repertoire of interdisciplinary
approaches, including live imaging, reverse and forward genetics and biophysical strategies to interrogate the
mechanics and regulation of closure in wild type and mutant embryos. We found that DC is the sum of four major
dynamic processes and is robust and resilient – no single force that drives closure is absolutely required.
Processes that contribute to DC at the molecular, cellular and tissue scales are highly conserved in animal
phylogeny making Drosophila an ideal model system for interrogating the molecular basis of morphogenesis.
 There remain significant gaps in our understanding of this conceptually simple, yet biologically complex cell
sheet movement. To identify new “DC genes”, i.e., genes that when deleted, disrupt closure, we initiated a forward
genetic, live-imaging, screen. This screen used 194 deficiency stocks (Dfs) that collectively delete 5,778 of the
5,854 genes on melanogaster's 2nd chromosome. We have begun to extend our screen to the 3rd chromosome.
Remarkably, 96 Dfs caused notable and diverse defects in closure, indicating that a large number of discrete
biological processes contribute to closure and are susceptible to mutational disruption. Thus far, we have
identified 13 new pre-DC or DC genes that are responsible for the DC Df phenotypes. When extended to the whole
fly genome our screen is projected to identify ~165 new DC genes (only ~140 DC genes were known at the start
of our screen). Based on phenotype, we prioritize the DC Dfs on which to focus, identify the DC genes responsible
for their Df phenotypes, then characterize how the new DC gene products contribute to closure. A priority is to
understand the molecular mechanisms by which cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix based adhesion couple to
the actomyosin cytoskeleton – these connections must be robust enough to transmit forces, yet malleable enough
to allow the cell shape changes that define morphogenesis. Of further interest is a new effort to
thermodynamically and kinetically characterize the myosin 2 motor that drives morphogenesis in DC and other
developmental processes. Our goal is to assess how differential splicing that encodes myosin's motor domain
contributes to morphogenesis as a fast moving, slow/efficient force holding, strain sensing, or processive motor.
We are uniquely positioned to address the molecular and biophysical mechanisms that underlie the basic biology
of cell sheet morphogenesis in flies, research that directly informs vertebrate development and wound healing."
10892786,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The bacterial outer membrane is a lipid bilayer that plays a key role in resistance to antibiotics, detergents, and
other external stresses. Despite decades of research on the bacterial envelope, it is still unclear how
phospholipids are trafficked between the bacterial inner and outer membranes. In addition, many other kinds of
hydrophobic molecules must be imported or exported from the cell, and dedicated transport systems are
required to move many of these molecules across the aqueous periplasm and outer membrane. Research in
my lab focuses on studying transport mechanisms in the bacterial cell envelope. We have shown that members
of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family form structurally diverse hexameric rings and barrels, and
that some of these proteins may form tunnels between the inner and outer membrane to facilitate lipid
transport. Very recently, several studies of the Mla pathway have been published by our lab and others, leading
to mechanistic insights into how this pathway may transport lipids across the cell envelope. Several other
MCE systems remain largely uncharacterized, and our initial work suggests that these function by
fundamentally different mechanisms relative to the Mla pathway. In the future, we will work to understand how
these unexplored MCE transport systems drive the transport of a range of hydrophobic substrates across the
cell envelope. We will use cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography to unravel how the structure of the individual
components supports their biological functions, and how these components assemble into larger inner
membrane, outer membrane, and potentially transenvelope complexes. We will also employ complementary
genetic and biochemical approaches to test hypotheses and probe the mechanism of trafficking by MCE
systems, including the identification of transporter substrates, how transport activity is regulated, how
lipids/substrates are are extracted from and inserted into the inner and outer membranes, and how
lipids/substrates are transported across the periplasm. This work will advance our understanding of a
fundamental yet poorly understood aspect of bacterial cell biology, and may open up avenues to the
development of new antibiotics that target important cellular processes. In addition, the presence of MCE
proteins in some double-membraned organelles, such as chloroplasts, suggests that understanding E. coli
MCE systems will also have direct implications for lipid trafficking in other bacterial-derived organelles."
10925154,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Transdermal drug delivery has many benefits including ease of product application for patients and more
consistent plasma drug concentrations compared to oral or IV dosing. However, many active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs) do not meet the strict physicochemical properties needed to permeate through the
hydrophobic outer skin layer. For APIs that cannot adequately absorb through skin, microneedles (MNs)
temporarily increase skin permeability through formation of epidermal micropores. There are two major routes
of API transport to consider with MN treatment: micropores (a hydrophilic environment), and intact skin around
the micropores (a hydrophobic environment). Effects of API properties and formulation are well understood for
delivery through intact skin, but they need to be systematically considered for MN delivery because of the
introduction of the second parallel transport pathway (micropores). In vivo micropore closure time and human
skin characteristics also impact API delivery with MNs, and these variables cannot be well simulated in vitro. The
long-term goal of this work is to improve API delivery and treatment options for a wide range of health conditions
through development of innovative MN dosage forms. The goal for the next 5 years is to determine significant in
vitro and in vivo factors impacting absorption of small molecule APIs through MN-treated skin. We will use in
vitro permeation tests and in vivo pharmacokinetics studies (in animals and humans) to answer key questions
about how API properties, formulation, and in vivo skin characteristics impact permeability and flux through
micropore vs. intact skin pathways. The main physicochemical characteristics we will initially investigate include
ionization/charge, logP, and pKa. Permeation will be examined in vitro under heated vs non-heated conditions
(heat can synergistically enhance skin API permeation), and MN properties (length, number) will be examined
for effects on permeation. This will give a mechanistic understanding of the API and MN properties having the
greatest impact on micropore permeation. Pharmacokinetics studies in guinea pigs will be completed so that in
vivo factors impacting permeation can be assessed and compared to in vitro predictions. A second major area
of study will involve pharmacokinetics studies in healthy human subjects. We will enroll a cohort of subjects >50
years of age, along with younger (<50 yrs) control subjects so we can 1) correlate age-related micropore closure
estimates with API absorption, and 2) study age-related skin changes on MN API delivery. The combined in vitro
and in vivo studies will maintain the high clinical relevance of the work. We expect to identify key physicochemical
properties and increase our understanding of structure-permeability relationships and biological aspects
impacting API permeability with MNs. This will generate fundamental knowledge that can result in direct clinical
applications and supports the NIGMS mission in the areas of drug delivery, absorption, transport, and kinetics."

 Reversible protein phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism that controls most cellular processes,
including mitosis. A ‘tug of war’ between kinases and phosphatases controls protein activity and function. The
precise coordination of both activities is essential for the accurate execution of cell division. Despite substantial
progress in deciphering kinase-mediated phosphorylation and its functional consequences, much less is known
about phosphatases and how dephosphorylation is regulated. The long-term goal of our research program is to
uncover the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate PPPs, kinases, and their shared substrates in the
signaling networks that control cell division.
 The majority of cellular dephosphorylation is carried out by the 7 catalytic phosphatase subunits of the
phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family. Despite the apparent simplicity suggested by the small number of
catalytic PPP enzymes, complexity and specificity arise through the formation of holoenzymes. Each
holoenzyme functions as a distinct entity. The non-catalytic subunits modulate the activity of the catalytic
subunits, enabling substrate specificity, dictating subcellular localization, and ensuring appropriate regulation.
Combinatorially, there are several hundred functional PPP holoenzymes.
 There are key gaps in knowledge and challenges in studying PPP function and mechanisms of
dephosphorylation. Although hundreds of thousands of phosphorylated sites on proteins have been identified,
only ~450 have been matched to be dephosphorylated by a specific PPP holoenzyme. This is in part due to the
lack of holoenzyme-specific inhibitors and the complexity of PPP holoenzymes.
 To overcome these obstacles and fill these gaps in knowledge, we will (i) identify holoenzyme-specific
substrates; (ii) dissect mechanisms of substrate recruitment and site-specific dephosphorylation; and (iii)
determine regulatory inputs governing specific PPP holoenzymes. We have developed new cell biological and
biochemical approaches to investigate PPP signaling. We plan to map the PPP substrate space
comprehensively, providing a foundation for studying PPPs for our lab and the signaling community by sharing
our findings broadly and openly via a user-friendly database that we will maintain. The mechanisms that PPPs
use to recruit substrates and catalyze site-specific dephosphorylation are still emerging. We will continue to
dissect these mechanisms to predict and systematically dissect PPP-substrate relationships in cells. Finally,
determining regulatory inputs that govern PPP holoenzyme formation, activity, and function is needed to
understand their role in regulating mitosis. We combine quantitative measurements of the proteome and
phosphoproteome with the reconstitution of minimal signaling units in vitro and in cells to precisely determine
phosphatase function and regulation in cell division."

My goal is to become an exceptional tenure track physician-scientist focused on identifying diverse and
unexpected cellular factors and pathways that regulate hematopoiesis, and elucidating the molecular
mechanisms of their function. This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award would
provide me with the necessary support to complete a rigorous and structured training program and establish
myself as a successful independent investigator. My proposed research focuses on the transcription factor
GATA2, which is critical for emergence of the blood and bone marrow during development and maintenance of
the bone marrow stem cell compartment in adults. Clinically, germline mutations in GATA2 cause the poorly
understood GATA2 Deficiency Syndrome. I hypothesize that there is a diverse and undiscovered network of
proteins that interface with GATA2 to modulate the process of hematopoiesis. To this end, I have developed
uniquely effective and specific anti-GATA2 antibodies that react with mouse and human GATA2 and utilized
these to identify 153 putative GATA2 interactors in erythroid precursor cells. In this proposal, I plan to establish
how these proteins function in GATA2 biology and in human and mouse erythropoiesis. I am supported in these
efforts by a team of accomplished investigators and mentors who constitute my Research Advisory Committee:
my primary mentor Dr. Emery Bresnick, an international expert in red cell biology, hematopoiesis and GATA
factors; Dr. Igor Slukvin, an international expert on induced pluripotent stem cells and their application for basic
and applied science; Dr. Jing Zhang, an internationally recognized expert on malignant hematopoiesis; and Dr.
Andreas Friedl, Chair of the UW-Madison Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine who has guided
my career development and organized my recruitment. I will also enjoy technical support from Dr. Ying Ge,
Professor of Cell and Regenerative Biology and Director of the Human Proteomics Program at UW-Madison.
These studies have the potential to radically expand our understanding of how a small number of transcription
factors accomplish the wide variety of functions necessary to successfully establish and maintain a healthy bone
marrow. The results will form the foundation for independent studies and future R01 proposals. The mentoring
and career development that I receive during the course of this research will prepare me to excel as a physician-
scientist and integrate me into the greater hematology community."
10755735,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and
is associated with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and reduced functional capacity. While numerous scientific
advances have been made to improve the care of patients with COPD, considerable uncertainty remains about
optimal management. For some questions, clinical trial data have been conflicting; for others, clinical trials
have not been feasible. Uncertainty in the management of COPD has been further compounded by questions
of generalizability in randomized controlled trials. Studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with
COPD would not qualify for such trials because of their strict inclusion criteria based on characteristics such as
age, comorbidities, smoking status, and spirometry. Conflicting or absent clinical trial data and questions of
generalizability prompt the need for “real-world” studies of patients treated for COPD in routine clinical practice.
Given poor adherence to inhaler therapy outside of clinical trials, studies are also needed to understand why
patients discontinue therapy. Improving the care of patients with COPD requires identifying which therapies are
most likely to be safe and effective in routine clinical practice and developing interventions to target those least
likely to be adherent. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to supplement existing data from
randomized controlled trials with pharmacoepidemiologic studies to refine treatment strategies in COPD.
 The proposed research will accomplish this goal by using large, longitudinal healthcare databases to
pursue three specific aims: (1) To validate claims-based definitions of COPD exacerbations; (2) To compare
the effectiveness and safety of therapies in the management of COPD, focusing on four areas of ongoing
clinical uncertainty; and (3) To develop a clinical prediction rule of inhaler adherence that incorporates key
variables across several domains, from out-of-pocket costs and insurance benefit design to therapy-related
features (e.g., frequency of dosing) and COPD disease severity. By addressing treatment effectiveness, safety,
and adherence among patients treated in routine clinical practice, the proposed research will glean novel
insights into the management of COPD, particularly for patients who are underrepresented in clinical trials,
including older adults, racial and ethnic minorities, women, and those with complex co-morbidities.
 Dr. Feldman has a unique background as a practicing pulmonologist with public health experience. This
K08 proposes an education plan that will help him build new skills in pharmacoepidemiology. He will receive
mentorship from Dr. Sebastian Schneeweiss, a pioneer in pharmacoepidemiology, and Dr. Aaron Kesselheim,
a leading authority on pharmaceutical policy and use, and will rely on a team of scientific advisors with
expertise in machine learning (Dr. Joshua Lin), data management (Dr. Shirley Wang), biostatistics (Dr. Robert
Glynn), geriatric prescribing (Dr. Jerry Avorn), and COPD epidemiology (Dr. Edwin Silverman). This award will
provide Dr. Feldman with the tools needed to become an independent investigator."
11032165,"Many HIV vaccine candidates have failed clinical trials, as they were unable to elicit a potent and durable response to
HIV viral challenge. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been identified in a number of HIV+ individuals with
well-controlled viral levels, and these bnAbs target epitopes that contain residues that are relatively conserved across viral
strains. It is thought bnAbs may have efficacy against various strains of HIV pathogen. It is therefore widely believed that
systems which induce a potent immune response that includes the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) in
humans could be effective HIV vaccines, and help to mitigate the wide genetic diversity in envelope proteins and
relatively high mutation rate of HIV.
However, developing a vaccine which can elicit the production of these bnAbs in vivo has proven to be extremely
challenging. This is likely due to the complex affinity maturation process that is required to produce bnAbs. Immunization
protocols typically administer a single dose of antigen (prime dose), which is sometimes followed by a “boost” dose
delivered several weeks later. In a traditional bolus immunization, the half-life of the antigen present in lymph nodes is
generally shorter than the time scale over which germinal centres start producing higher affinity IgG antibodies relative to
the initial IgM response (~18 hrs). In contrast, natural infections expose the immune system to escalating antigen and
inflammation over days to weeks, resulting in the formation of a germinal centre with dynamic antigen presentation. This
germinal centre niche also supports activation of antigen presenting cells, T follicular helper cells, and appropriate
cytokine signalling to generate bnAbs. It is likely that to develop effective bnAbs, sophisticated vaccination techniques
which can more closely mimic natural infections and natural bnAb formation may be required.
We believe that to develop a successful HIV vaccine, researchers must aim to engineer more sophisticated and biomimetic
vaccines. Bioengineered vaccines should therefore consider three key parameters in parallel; 1) delivery of an
appropriately selected antigen, with 2) favourable kinetics of antigen expression, and 3) control of the immune response in
the germinal centre. We believe lymph node targeted delivery of computationally designed mRNA antigens inside
immunostimulatory lipid nanoparticles (mRNA LNPs) administered with computationally optimized immunization
protocols will address these three aspects in a unique way. Additionally,Translate Bio will provide expertise in
manufacturing considerations for mRNA therapeutics. As modifications to mRNA structure may impact the mRNA
antigen translation, stability, and immunogenicity, the input of our translational partner (Translate Bio) will allow us to
develop vaccines with a potential avenue for commercial development. This R61/R33 proposal combines our expertise in
computational antigen design, HIV immunology, combinatorial chemistry, and the commercialisation of mRNA
therapeutics to develop a new class of HIV mRNA vaccine candidates."
10812459,"Abstract
Protein footprinting (PF) is a powerful medium resolution structural biology technique for
assessing protein structure and dynamics that relies on “bottom-up” mass spectrometry (MS) to
detect, identify, and quantitatively analyze the small (5-15 residue) peptides that are generated in
protease-based workflows. Early on hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) led the way, later
advances in irreversible reagent development, such as hydroxyl radical footprinting (HRF)
mediated by radiolysis; or methods utilizing photolysis of peroxide, and recently plasma, have
been introduced and refined. As a result, PF is routinely applied in understanding the effects of
protein-ligand binding on higher order interactions in solution, even for large macromolecules like
antibodies, large molecular complexes, and membrane proteins; all of which are important drug
targets and biological machines. However, state of the art HRF-based PF studies typically report
data from only <20% of the possible sites within the above peptides, limiting the overall impact.
In part this is due to the high reactivity of sulfur containing (Met in particular) and aromatic residues
relative to many others, creating dynamic range issues for simultaneously detecting high and low
abundant species in the same experiment. In this proposal, responsive to PAR-19-253, we
propose a range of novel labeling, biophysics, and mass spectrometry methods, based on
radical activated trifluoromethylation based chemistries, to provide multiplex, high-
resolution labeling and mass spectrometry analysis workflows to maximize value and
impact of PF studies, with readouts from 50-100% of accessible side chains within the
relevant peptides. The project leverages our advanced synchrotron radiolysis platform and our
validation and collaboration strategies will extend the results to major PF platforms such as:
radiolysis, photolysis, and plasma based HRF.
In Aim 1 (months 0-20), we will benchmark the chemistry of hydroxyl radical induced TFM,
understanding its side chain-based reactivity compared to OH radical by examining amino acid
and peptide based reactivity for a variety of available TFM reagents. Initial developments of these
TFM labeling approaches leverage our advanced synchrotron radiolysis platform for HRF, but we
will validate the method using both radiolysis and photolysis, and finding optimum conditions for
expanding PF coverage while optimizing dynamic range of labeling. Milestones: Modify ~16/20
residues in a one-pot reaction (vs ~12/20 today). Dynamic range of ~100 or less in separate +16
(-O) and +68 (-CF3) channels (vs. 1000-today in one +16 (-O) channel). In Aim 2 (months 20-
40), we will extend our findings that the Langlois reagent is a promising candidate for hydroxyl
radical induced TFM and probing protein structure in a quantitative way using structurally
understood and PF tractable calmodulin and estrogen receptor as benchmarked targets.
Milestone: Optimize and validate a simple, easy to implement workflow for quantitative structure
assessment of proteins based on TFM labeling (radiolysis and photolysis) at structural resolution
of 50-100% of residues at the peptide level of accessible residues. Demonstrate method reflects
structure at an accuracy of +/- 30Å2. In Aim 3 (months 40-60) we will explore Langlois and other
reagents as chemical labeling approaches for footprinting driven small molecule structure activity
analysis, to expand structural coverage of protein pockets for optimizing ligand-protein interaction
analysis. Milestone: 18/20 residues potentially labelled through multi-pot reactions achieving 80-
100% coverage. In addition, the technology developments will be tested and disseminated in
beamline to benchtop protocols with collaborations and through direct training of a wide PF
community through publications and workshops."

Accurate cell division is essential for the development of all organisms. During each cell cycle, chromosomes
must be precisely partitioned to daughter cells. Defects in chromosome partitioning generate aneuploidy, the
state where entire chromosomes are gained or loss. Aneuploidy is a the most common chromosomal abnormality
in cancer cells and is thought to be a major factor in the evolution of cancer. It is also the leading cause of
miscarriages and hereditary birth defects in humans. The proposed work will lead to an understanding of the
mechanisms that ensure accurate chromosome partitioning. This work is important for maintaining genomic
stability and preventing human disease. Chromosome partitioning occurs when spindle microtubules move
chromosomes by interacting with kinetochores, the machines that assemble onto the chromosome at a locus
called the centromere. Kinetochores carry out a number of functions, such as maintaining load-bearing
attachments to the ends of microtubules that are continually growing and shrinking. They also control the cell
cycle when there is a defect in kinetochore attachments to microtubules. Our lab will address two fundamental
questions about chromosome segregation using in vitro assays: 1) How is kinetochore assembly regulated? 2)
How do kinetochore proteins contribute to force-dependent kinetochore-microtubule attachments? We will use
budding yeast for these studies because they are amenable to biochemical, genetic and cytological studies, and
the yeast kinetochore is the best characterized to date. Taken together, our work will lead toward an
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome partitioning in all eukaryotes."

The etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects an
estimated 10 million people in the Americas, with an at-risk population of 70 million. Despite its recognition as
the highest impact parasitic infection of the Americas, Chagas disease remains underreported, understudied
and underfunded. Basic research into the biology of T. cruzi has previously been hindered by a lack of efficient
genetic tools, but the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has cleared the way for more in-depth
molecular analyses. Among the human infecting parasitic trypanosomatids, T. cruzi is extremely unique for a
number of reasons: it develops into its infectious form in the hindgut of insects, is transmitted to its mammalian
host via the feces of its insect vector, lives directly in the cytosol of its mammalian host cell and utilizes an
ancient feeding organelle to endocytose extracellular material in a manner much like its bacterivorous free-
living relatives. This endocytic structure is composed of a long tubular invagination (cytopharynx) starting at a
surface plasma membrane pore (cytostome) which we refer to here as the cytostome/cytopharynx complex or
SPC. The SPC is a highly dynamic organelle that is present and functional only in the replicating forms of the
parasite and disassembles during the transition to its infectious stages. Until recently the SPC had only been
examined using electron tomography techniques and had resisted molecular analysis as the protein
components comprising it remained elusive. Our initial published work described the first proteins known to be
targeted to the SPC and was followed by the identification of a family of SPC targeted myosin motors that we
show contribute directly to the endocytic process. Recently, however, we have identified an essential myosin
regulatory component of the SPC (MyAP1), a knockout of which resulted in parasites that are completely
devoid of measurable endocytosis and who are defective in their ability to scavenge host lipids. Although viable
in culture, we have also demonstrated through infections of the insect vector (R. prolixus) that endocytosis is
critical for the parasite to be able to establish a robust infection and colonize the insect hindgut, a necessary
step for effective transmission to its mammalian host. Completion of this study will allow us to continue to
elucidate the molecular machinery responsible for the formation and function of the SPC as well as give insight
into why it is that T. cruzi retained this ancient mode of nutrient uptake. Our endocytic-null mutant also gives us
the unique opportunity to finally examine the “endocytome” of this parasite. Although not limited to lipids, we
are excited by preliminary data allowing us for the first time to now distinguish which lipids are actively being
scavenged through endocytosis from those which the parasite is able to endogenously produce for itself. The
goal for this proposal is ultimately to give greater insight into parasite pathways essential for vector
transmission as well as provide a window into the biosynthetic pathways that are actively present and
necessary for parasite viability."

grant is a long-standing, impactful and multidisciplinary initiative that has supported 130 pre-doctoral trainees
and 18 post-doctoral researchers over the past 41 years. Graduates of this program conduct basic and applied
research, teach at universities and colleges, evaluate product safety, and assist public agencies and private
industries in resolving important public health and environmental problems. Our mission is to provide the next
generation of toxicologists/environmental health science (EHS) researchers with the technical, operational and
professional skills necessary to conduct high impact EHS research, communicate effectively to a wide variety of
audiences, and work as part of multidisciplinary teams to understand how human health is impacted by
environmental factors. In this competitive renewal, we will continue with the current Molecular Pathways to
Pathogenesis in Toxicology training theme and our overarching systems biology framework. This approach aims
to integrate all levels of biological organization from biomolecules to human populations to elucidate the
fundamental mechanisms through which environmental stressors influence human health outcomes. We have
added 10 new research-active faculty for a total of 28 mentors, enhanced our mentor training requirements,
reorganized key research areas, and updated core curricula. We have enhanced our core professional
development series in scientific rigor, reasoning, experimental design and methods, and data analysis and
interpretation through formal training in science communication, training in grant writing, coding in “R”, and
methods for enhancing reproducibility. Participating mentors of this NIEHS T32 training grant are supported by

Since achieving NCI designation in 2018, the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) at the University of Oklahoma
has continued to grow and mature as an organization. The SCC’s vision to eliminate cancer in Oklahoma and
beyond is advanced through its mission to provide patient-centered, research-driven, multidisciplinary cancer
care to all Oklahomans. As Oklahoma’s only NCI-designated cancer center, the SCC serves a statewide
catchment area that presents unique challenges with social determinants of health and high disparities in
cancer incidence and mortality, especially for the state’s American Indian (AI), Black/African American, and
rural populations. The SCC has the ability to be impactful in its catchment area and nationally due to
strategically targeted recruitments and investments that have leveraged key differentiating factors: 1) the SCC
continues to invest in creating and sustaining health and research partnerships with AI tribal partners
throughout Oklahoma and currently has 22 NIH funded projects addressing AI cancer disparities; 2) the SCC
continues to be a national leader in the NCI/NCTN and has established a statewide network of affiliate sites to
ensure access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials throughout its catchment area; 3) the SCC has developed strong
team-based research across all of its programs with national leadership in gynecologic, colon, and pancreatic
cancers, cancer prevention, cancer therapeutics, gero-oncology, and tobacco control; and 4) the SCC is
building upon its national leadership in mobile health technologies to address the burden on cancer in rural and
vulnerable populations.
Multiple NCI CCSG metrics emphasize the growth and maturation of the SCC during the reporting period
(2017-21). SCC membership increased from 83 to 120 (45%), with 31 of these new members being externally
recruited to add expertise to programs. Annual, peer-reviewed research funding (DC) grew 61% ($14.28M 
$22.97M) and total annual research funding grew 42% ($30.13M  $43.09M). The overall five-year number of
scientific publications has increased by 54% since the last reporting period (945  1,454), with 16% having an
impact factor ≥10 (up from 7%). Team science has been emphasized resulting in 139 collaborative grants
(36% increase) and a 17% inter-programmatic publication rate (up from 4%) over the prior reporting period.
The number of annual active interventional IITs has doubled from 20 to 40 over the past five years, with annual
accruals to interventional IITs increasing from 661 (2017) to 927 (2021) – a 40% increase. This degree of

HIV-1 vaccines that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are a primary goal. To date, it has been
demonstrated that a single bnAb lineage (VRC01-class) can be specifically activated in human trials. Antibodies
from this trial do not neutralize HIV-1 and heterologous sequential immunization is thought to be required to
develop bnAbs. Heterologous sequential immunization has been employed to generate bnAbs in pre-clinical
models. While VRC01-class antibodies isolated from infected individuals can be quite broad, the limit of breadth
for VRC01-class antibodies induced by these types of vaccination strategies in people is unknown. Therefore,
we are developing an alternative bnAb lineage targeting vaccine (VH1-46 class) through advanced protein
engineering approaches and assessment in newly generated human immunoglobulin knock-in mice harboring
VH1-46 germline antibodies. Further, we are pursuing innovative approaches to develop a dual bnAb lineage
targeting vaccine which could synergize with current VRC01-class vaccines. Individual lineage targeting
vaccines may not succeed at fully maturating these lineages, thus severely limiting the neutralization breadth
and ultimate effectiveness of these vaccines. Dual lineage targeting may be critical for success of the first bnAb-
eliciting HIV-1 vaccine."

We are requesting continuing support for 5 summer veterinary research fellowships at Wake Forest
University School of Medicine, as part of a multilevel training program in comparative medicine and
biomedical research. Our smaller training program is an impactful and unique opportunity for student to see
DVMs as research scientists in a medical school environment. Students will also gain exposure to the use of
NHPs and other animals as translational models for human health. The national shortage of veterinary
scientists in biomedical research is well documented in terms of vacant veterinary research positions and
unmet collaborative needs. This shortage has resulted in deficits in the quality of research findings and lost
productivity among researchers using animals. Correcting the dearth of veterinary researchers requires
education of veterinary students regarding research methods and opportunities and the unique value of their
professional skills. Early exposure to research and the diversity of career options available post-graduation
from veterinary school is the most promising strategy. Therefore, the proposed summer research program
seeks to expose veterinary students to biomedical research through practical experience. Objectives are (1)
To provide a structured summer research experience at Wake Forest School of Medicine; (2) to teach
students in the program the basic elements of hypothesis driven research, grant writing, and data analysis;
(3) to provide training in ethics and professionalism in research; and (4) to provide the students with
experience in oral and written presentation of scientific findings. Training will be principally accomplished by
one on one mentoring through completion of a research project guided by a senior researcher chosen from a
pool of over 30 program faculty which are highly enriched with research veterinarians working in diverse
fields including pathology, comparative medicine, biology of aging, surgery, physiology/pharmacology,
neurobiology, rheumatology/immunology, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, nutrition, cancer,
radiation countermeasures, and reproductive medicine/women’s health. Students will also participate in a
dedicated short course in research survival skills, and in ongoing seminars and journal clubs in the Section
on Comparative Medicine. Students will write a research proposal and a final report of their findings, and will
be encouraged to present their findings nationally and to publish. This program will provide opportunities for
original scientific thought, ethical reflection, and acquisition of critical skills, in a setting uniquely supportive of
veterinarians as independent researchers within an environment that is singly aimed at improving human
health and the promotion of translational medicine."

The overall aim of this new Program Project (P01) proposal is to generate highly collaborative and integrated
basic and translational research on the urgent, unmet medical need of epithelial cancers caused by Epstein-Barr
Virus (EBV). EBV latent infection is causally linked to over 200,000 new cancer cases per year. EBV epithelial
cancers represent over 75% of all EBV cancers with highest mortality rates and treatment failures. EBV-
associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have many similarities with
respect to viral latency and oncogenic transformation. The mechanisms through which EBV contributes to these
epithelial cancers remains elusive, and to date, there are no viral-specific therapies that are FDA approved to
treat cancers infected with EBV. We have assembled a team of EBV investigators with expertise in
complementary aspects of tumor virology and cancer biology, with specific areas of interest in viral genetics,
epigenetics, metabolism, drug discovery, and models of EBV carcinogenesis. The Program team will collaborate
in a coordinated strategy to identify key viral and cellular vulnerabilities in EBV epithelial cancers that can be
targeted for therapeutic intervention. The Program will test the central hypothesis that EBV cancers arise in the
context of somatic mutations in metabolic and epigenetic pathways that alter EBV latency and oncogenicity, and
how this viral-host co-dependency provides therapeutic opportunities. To achieve these goals for the Program
we propose three Projects and three scientific Cores to address the following: (1) Determine how EBV
establishes a latent and oncogenic infection in epithelial cancer cells (2) Determine how EBV latent
infection drives epigenetic and metabolic shifts including the formation of CpG island methylator
phenotype (CIMP) to promote epithelial cell oncogenesis. (3) Leverage mechanistic insights to develop
new therapeutic strategies to treat EBV epithelial cancers. The 3 Projects focus broadly on EBV latency
and epigenome (Lieberman), PARP, NAD and DNA damage metabolism (Tempera), and DNA methylation and
methionine metabolism (Gewurz). The 3 scientific Cores support bioinformatics, drug discovery, and models of
EBV cancers to support each of the 3 Projects as research enhancers. Together, this team and Program will
investigate key features of EBV cancer mechanisms, build new tools to study EBV cancers, and develop new
therapeutic strategies that are viral-specific and precision-based medicine."
10840306,"PROJECT 1 – PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to determine how EBV establishes an oncogenic latent epigenome in EBV-
associated epithelial cancers and to leverage this information to develop new therapeutic strategies to target
EBV latent infection in epithelial cancers. All EBV cancers share the common feature of maintaining latent viral
genomes that express a restricted subset of viral oncogenes. EBV epithelial cancers also have the distinguishing
feature of CpG Island Methylation Phenotype (CIMP). The role of EBV latent infection in driving CIMP, and the
role of CIMP in regulating oncogenic EBV latency are not fully elucidated, but critical for understanding EBV
carcinogenesis. In Aim 1, we propose to investigate how EBV latent infection promotes CIMP. We will test the
specific hypothesis that EBNA1-driven episome maintenance induces a PARP1-dependent DNA-damage
response that drives CIMP. In collaboration with Project 2, we will investigate the role of PARP1 and UHRF1 in
the formation of site-specific viral and host DNA methylation. In collaboration with Project 3, we will explore the
role of PI3K activation in controlling replication stress in epithelial cancers. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that CIMP and other somatic changes, such as PI3K and ARID1A mutations, facilitate the formation of a viral
type II latency. In collaboration with Project 2, we will examine the role of CTCF and CIMP on EBV 3D
conformation. With Project 3, we will investigate how metabolic changes favor establishment of type II latency
in epithelial cancers. Finally, we will work in collaboration with Projects 2, 3 and all Cores to identify new
therapeutic approaches to treat EBV(+) epithelial cancers. To this end, we have developed new small molecule
inhibitors and mouse models of EBV epithelial cancers to better understand these mechanisms and test
therapeutic strategies. The overarching hypothesis of Project 1 is that EBV epithelial malignancies
depend on the establishment of a distinct epigenetic state involving CpG methylator phenotype (CIMP)
and that key regulators of this epigenetic state are therapeutic targets in EBV epithelial carcinogenesis."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is caused by hepatitis virus HBV/HCV, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which typically progress from liver fibrosis, to cirrhosis and cancer. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that genetic deletion of IL-17 signaling in steatotic hepatocytes significantly
attenuates the development of HCC in ALD-injured mice, suggesting that IL-17 signaling is a target for anti-
HCC therapy. Our central hypothesis is that IL-17 signaling regulates chemokine production, de novo
lipogenesis, and TNFRI expression/turnover in steatotic hepatocytes. IL-17 signaling promotes ALD- and
NASH-induced HCC via activation of TNF/TNFRI-SREBP1/2-DHCR7-cholesterol synthesis, and suppression
of ARTS-1/NUC2-dependent TNFRI exocytosis. The goal of the study is to characterize the mechanism by
which IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling regulates responses in metabolically injured hepatocytes, and to compare the
pathways of IL-17 signaling in the experimental models of ALD- and NASH. Strategy: Responses to IL-17
signaling will be compared side-by side in ALD- and NASH-injured WT and hepatocyte-specific IL-17RA
knockout mice with HCC. We determine if IL-17 signaling is similarly activated in NASH- and ALD-injured
hepatocytes. We determine if blocking of IL-17 signaling in steatotic hepatocytes is sufficient to suppress HCC
in the metabolically injured liver. Specifically, the role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of DEN- or (Mup-uPA)-
induced HCC in ALD- and NASH-injury will be studied in WT and hepatocyte-specific IL-17RA knockout mice
(IL-17RAΔHep mice). Development of HCC, inflammation, steatosis and liver fibrosis will be across all groups of
mice. Mutagenesis of WT and IL-17RA-deficient AFP+YAP+ HCC, and responses of steatotic hepatocytes to
IL-17A will be characterized. Specifically, we determine if chemokine secretion, cholesterol synthesis are
suppressed in metabolically injured IL-17RA-deficient hepatocytes (AIM1). We will test a novel hypothesis by
which IL-17 signaling facilitates TNF/TNFRI-Caspase2-SP1-SREBP1/2-DHCR7-dependent cholesterol
synthesis in steatotic hepatocytes via blocking ARTS-1-NUCB2-regulated TNFRI exocytosis (and possibly IL-
6, IL-1RII) thereby prolonging TNF (IL-6, IL-1) signaling and promoting alcohol-induced HCC (AIM2). Our
findings will be translated into humans by characterization of IL-17RA-TNFRI-signaling pathways in archived
human livers from HCC patients with ALD. We will test if therapeutic blocking of the key IL-17 signaling
molecules (IL-17RA, TNFRI, ARTS-1, and DHCR7) specifically in hepatocytes using N-acetylgalactosamine
(GalNAc)-conjugated antisense RNA oligonucleotides (ASOs) can effectively suppress steatosis, fibrosis, and
HCC in WT mice with NASH and ALD (AIM3). If proven, hepatocyte-specific blocking of IL-17 signaling using
GalNAc-ASOs can provide a new strategy for HCC treatment in ALD and NASH patients."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been alarmingly increased, in part due to rapid increases
in fatty liver disease. Owing to the lack of early diagnostic markers, HCC's 5-year survival is only 10%.
Alcoholism is a well-known HCC risk factor, but the mechanism of how alcohol induces HCC is still
unclear. Another HCC risk factor is consumption of dietary fructose, especially in liquid form (soft
drinks), which has increased 100-fold over the past two centuries. Based on our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that fructose alters hepatic alcohol metabolism via induction of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2
(ACSS2), which enhances the hepatic usage of alcohol carbons to generate carcinogenic metabolites
and thereby creates a pro-tumorigenic environment. When alcohol reaches the liver, it is converted to
acetate and mostly released into circulation. However, when ACSS2 is activated, flux is shifted from
acetate release to acetate catabolism, resulting in excessive production of acetyl-CoA, a high-energy-
charged, reactive metabolite. This alteration can initiate and support HCC in many ways, including
carcinogenic metabolite production. Indeed, ACSS overexpression and increased acetate usage are
commonly observed in cancers including HCC. We recently found that mice exposed to fructose
showed strongly induced hepatic ACSS2 activity and acetate usage. Thus, fructose drinking will shift
the metabolic fate of alcohol from release as acetate to usage of acetate within the liver. Fructose
drinking also induces gut leakiness and alters microbiota metabolism. The resulting toxic microbiota
metabolites cause chronic hepatic inflammation, which is a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. We will
test these hypotheses by systematically defining the impact of fructose-elicited ACSS2 induction and
microbiota changes on liver alcohol metabolic flux. In Aim 1, we will determine whether and how
fructose and alcohol synergistically increase HCC risk. Using in vivo stable isotope tracing of 13C-
ethanol and hepatic-portal comparative metabolomics in mice, we will quantitatively define progressive
changes of hepatic alcohol metabolism during HCC initiation and progression. This will build a
comprehensive catalog of HCC-associated, alcohol-derived metabolites. We will then choose the top
candidate metabolites and test whether these metabolites can trigger HCC. In Aim 2, we will test our
hypothesis that fructose-induced hepatic ACSS2 activity and/or colonic microbiota changes enhance
carcinogenic metabolite production in the liver, thereby triggering HCC. To this end, we will use our
newly generated liver-specific ACSS2 knockdown mice and antibiotics treatment. These studies will
provide molecular evidence for a clinically relevant question about how the two best-known dietary risk
factors, alcohol and fructose, synergistically initiate and advance HCC. Our study's success will have
direct impacts on public dietary guidelines and provide mechanistic insights into alcohol-induced HCC."

interdepartmental Program is to train PhD students in the fundamentals of classical and modern genetics and
in application of their knowledge and skills to innovations in biomedicine. Diversity and inclusion are integral
components of this mission. Our objectives are to provide students with rigorous and methodical training in
genetics and genomics while emphasizing research and academic excellence, and to help them become
leaders among the next generation of biomedical scientists. We are currently training 97 predoctoral students,
an increase of 16% in the past 5 years, and we plan to train 100 new students in the next 5 years. We currently
have 84 faculty mentors, an increase of 20% in the past 5 years. Their research projects span a wide range of
interests, including human genetics, genomics, the molecular basis of human disease, animal models of
human disease, microbial genetics, development, neurobiology, and genome stability. The common themes
among these topics are genetics and genomics, and their translation to human health. The training elements in
the first year include foundational and advanced courses, laboratory rotations, and skill development activities.
The courses are focused on design and analysis of genetic-based experiments and the rotations provide
individualized practical research experiences. Skill development includes training in the responsible conduct of
research, ethical aspects of human genetics in the genomic era, rigor and reproducibility in experimental
science, scientific communications, critical thinking, and teamwork. In the second year, the students join
research laboratories in which they conduct projects under the mentorship of our faculty, as they begin their
path to independence. They also take a qualifying examination that trains them to integrate knowledge from
courses and from the literature and to design an original experimental research project. In addition to training in
experimental work, the students learn how to analyze their data, how to present their findings orally and in
writing, and how to participate in the scientific process in a collegial and constructive way. The students are
also encouraged to participate in career development activities throughout their training. The thesis project
culminates in the preparation and defense of a thesis dissertation. The average time to a PhD degree is 5.7
years and the average number of publications is 6.1, including 2.1 first-author papers. Our retention rate is
96%, and most of our alumni use their training in their subsequent positions. We are requesting 16 slots, 8 per
year for the first 2 years of training, to match our increased training capacity and the proven success of the
only T32-supported Genetics & Genomics PhD Program in Texas and within a 600 mile radius of Houston."

10842319,"The overall goal of the program is to provide multidisciplinary training in Alzheimer’s
disease and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) to predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees,
producing a critically-needed translational workforce for developing effective treatments. The
Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) is nationally recognized for AD/ADRD research.
IUSM-associated centers include the Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, the
National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease, the Indiana Center for Neuroimaging, the
Regenstrief Institute and the Center for Aging Research. Importantly, the NIA recently funded
the MODEL-AD Center, the Alzheimer’s Disease Drug Discovery Center, and the IUSM-directed
Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study.
 IUSM has invested significantly in state-of-the-art facilities, instrumentation, and the
hiring of 10 new AD/ADRD faculty over the past 4 years. This T32 application has enlisted 25
participating faculty with a broad range of expertise including data science, non-invasive
imaging, the development and study of animal models, genomics, epidemiology, drug
development and discovery, and clinical studies and trials. These faculty are exceptional
mentors and are funded at $42M total ($1.69M/faculty annually).
 This application requests funding for 4 pre- and 4 post-doctoral trainees. We will recruit
trainees with diverse backgrounds and train them in AD/ADRD research with contemporary
approaches and methodologies using state-of-the-art instrumentation. The predoctoral trainees
are graduate students in the Medical Neuroscience Graduate Program, recruited from the IUSM
Indiana Biomedical Gateway graduate program and the MD/PhD program. Targeted recruiting
of postdoctoral trainees with diverse backgrounds is achieved informally, through our website,
and at national and regional meetings. Enrollment in the MedNeuro Graduate Program has
doubled since 2017 and the number of postdoctoral fellows with participating faculty has
increased from 4 to 27.
 The predoctoral training program consists of foundational course work in neuroscience,
neurodegenerative diseases, and data science along with elective studies. Postdoctoral trainees
are offered didactic training in data science.
 The NIA-sponsored centers and resources at IUSM allow trainees to work on new
disease models, advanced drug-discovery technologies, and in clinical settings. This positions
trainees to conduct innovative basic, translational, and clinical AD/ADRD research."
10883579,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core 2: Human Specimen and Organoid Core
Patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) often fail to respond to therapeutic intervention
or rapidly develop resistance to treatment. To study mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, the assembled P01
research team will utilize a large and representative cohort of PDA patient-derived three-dimensional organoid
models (PDOs). Organoids accurately recapitulate the genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic characteristics
of human PDA and enable predictive profiling of drug response in a heterogenous patient-cohort. The Human
Specimen and Organoid Core (HSO Core) will facilitate the elucidation of mechanisms of resistance in
collaboration with each Research Project. The HSO Core will test numerous novel therapeutic combinations to
determine effective and synergistic strategies. The Core will provide a powerful patient-derived organotypic
tumor slice platform for ex vivo mechanistic studies. In addition, the HSO Core will generate organoid co-cultures
with key stromal cells and will develop organoids from genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models that develop
spontaneous PDA. The overall goal of the HSO Core is to support each Project in the discovery and validation
of effective therapeutic strategies to overcome treatment resistance. To accomplish this, the HSO Core has three
Aims. In Aim 1, The Core will provide methodology expertise and valuable PDO models tailored to each
individual Project. Novel therapeutic combinations that include drugs such as Entinostat (Project 1) and ULK1/2
inhibitors (Project 3) will be profiled using a pharmacotyping assay that takes advantage of the Core’s
heterogenous cohort of organoids. Combinations will be evaluated and synergies mathematically defined.
Existing DNA/RNA-sequencing datasets will be leveraged to discover predictive signatures of drug sensitivity
and resistance. In Aim 2, the Core will provide access to an organotypic living tumor slice model that preserves
the neoplastic and stromal cellular compartments of PDA. Methodologies developed by the HSO Core allow for
ex vivo culture up to 7 days, enabling the perturbation and characterization of cell to cell signaling networks.
Further, the Core will develop co-culture systems that incorporate epithelial organoids, fibroblasts, and immune
cells in collaboration with Projects 2. Finally in Aim 3, the Core will collaborate with the Mouse Models Core to
generate mouse-derived organoids from previously unavailable GEM models and develop organoid resources
to facilitate the workflow of the Research Projects and Cores."
10883584,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core 3: Mouse Models Core
The Mouse Models Core (MM Core) will provide essential, value-added services in support of all P01 projects.
As all projects propose preclinical experimental therapeutic trials with murine models, such trials will benefit from
expert professional staff where uniform procedures and standardized imaging protocols would enable
comparison of therapeutic regimens across the P01 and ensure reliability, reproducibility, and consistency of all
proposed studies. In support of these goals, the MM Core has three Specific Aims. The First Aim of the MM Core
is to provide orthotopic transplantation services of mouse and human material, which will be used to identify cell
compartment-specific vulnerabilities. The MM Core will transplant mouse and human pancreatic cancer
organoids to enable analyses of intrinsic and acquired resistance, and to test new strategies for overcoming
these challenges that have historically limited long-term therapeutic successes. The MM Core will use orthotopic
transplantation to: 1) determine the ability of HDAC inhibition to synergize with DNA damaging agents, reprogram
fibroblast heterogeneity, and potentiate the response to immunotherapy (Project 1), 2) assess the impact of LIF
and STAT3 loss in the tumor microenvironment on tumor growth (Project 2), and 3) determine the extent to
which CA-19-9 levels affect autophagy (Project 3). The Second Aim of the MM Core is to provide access to
enough tumors generated in the KPC autochthonous model to perform survival studies on the most promising
drug combination regimens identified in each Research Project. The KPC model is challenging, as the mice must
be bred and genotyped, and then animals with tumors must be enrolled at appropriate and reproducible time
points using ultrasound imaging to assess tumor size. The MM Core will enable the KPC model to be used in a
way that benefits from a dedicated staff with expertise in the specialized diagnostic techniques required to enroll
animals harboring tumors between 5-8 mm. This will ensure consistency in the husbandry needed for survival
studies. To minimize the number of animals required, and costs incurred, decisions on which drug combinations
will be used for KPC survival studies will be based on evaluation of all orthotopic transplantation data by the
Project Leads in consultation with the EAB. Drug combinations showing significant survival benefit in the KPC
model will then be evaluated in a second trial to ensure reproducibility. The Third Aim is designed to provide
access to intraductal injection of viral Cre to create pancreas-specific deletions in mice encoding complex allele
combinations. This unique and demanding technique will be optimized by the Core to achieve uniformity and
reproducibility. Among other applications, this procedure will be used extensively in Project 3 to delineate the
role of AMPK and ULK1/2 in tumorigenesis. Taken together, the MM Core will provide reliable, reproducible,
high-quality services and provide access to the techniques required to study tumor cells and the tumor
microenvironment using transplants and autochthonous mouse models and ultrasound imaging."
10817185,"Endometriosis, a chronic painful gynecological disorder defined as the presence of endometrial glands
and stroma outside the endometrial cavity, is characterized by peritoneal inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions,
and ovarian cysts. Women with endometriosis often present gastrointestinal symptoms independent of
lesion localization. Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are astrocyte-like cells that are vital to the enteric nervous
system and play a role in gut diseases. The role of intestinal glia in endometriosis is unknown; however, a
bidirectional relationship between the EGC and immune cells in the modulation of the inflammatory
response and pain sensitization is postulated. Enteric glia can produce an endogenous ligand for
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR) with anti-inflammatory activity. PPAR
agonists in endometriosis animal models reduce vesicle size. The study team’s previous work has
demonstrated that exercise can increase expression and activity of PPAR, while reducing vesicle size
and development. The main objective is to examine the role of EGC in the pathophysiology of
endometriosis with the long-term goal of finding new therapeutic targets. The study team hypothesizes that
endometriosis-induced immune activation is regulated by ECG which promotes and maintains chronic
inflammation, and that this can be reversed by non-pharmacological complementary interventions. Aim 1
will determine how endometriosis impacts the enteric glia and how this correlates with pain. Aim 2 will
elucidate whether the beneficial effects of interventions, such as exercise and environmental enrichment,
are mediated by PPAR. Rationale: complementary interventions will impact the enteric glia via
parasympathetic activation, shifting it from the endometriosis-induced, pro-inflammatory phenotype to an
anti-inflammatory one, decreasing proinflammatory cytokine release and oxidative stress.
 Successful outcomes could explain chronic pelvic inflammation and gastrointestinal symptoms and
provide a novel target. This study will contribute to the goals of the SuRE program by sustaining the
research excellence of the PI and strengthening the institutional research environment. This study will
provide graduate and undergraduate students at various levels with opportunities in multidisciplinary
research areas to encourage their continued involvement in biomedical sciences research and stimulate
their interest in novel integrative interventions."

10846565,"Abstract Statement
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the world, with significant morbidity and mortality. With
appropriate oral anticoagulation, the risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation decreases by 64%. Although atrial
fibrillation is commonly diagnosed and treated in the Emergency Department (ED), oral anticoagulation is
significantly underprescribed. Underprescribing has been attributed to a lack of empowerment and deferral of
prescribing to longitudinal care clinicians. However, patients often do not follow-up with longitudinal care
clinicians, resulting in missed opportunities to provide guideline-recommended care. Our proposal focuses on
this missed opportunity to change the trajectory of care in the ED for patients with atrial fibrillation with
appropriate early prescribing of oral anticoagulants, and thereby, improve clinical outcomes. This R01
Physician-Scientist Early Investigator proposal is in keeping with the mission of NHLBI ""to promote the
prevention and treatment of heart disease … and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live
longer and more fulfilling lives."" We leverage an existing outpatient shared-decision making clinical decision
support tool to improve stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation and test its ability to improve
guideline-recommended care in the acute care setting of the Emergency Department—a fast-paced, episodic,
high-intensity environment. Electronic health record clinical decision support (CDS) tools have emerged as a
means to guide clinicians on best practices and can make a significant impact on clinical outcomes. By
increasing guideline adherence and improving the transition of care from the ED to the outpatient setting, this
proposal could significantly reduce the risk of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation with an intervention that
could be rapidly and effectively disseminated across other settings. The project is a convergent parallel
quantitative-qualitative study (mixed-methods) consisting of three components: (1) Implement a clinical
decision support tool in a multi-centered stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, (2) Identify clinician
facilitators and barriers to ideal AF care and refine CDS tools for different settings using qualitative
approaches, and (3) Explore patient satisfaction with the tool for future scalability and generalizability.
This research will allow Dr. Kea to gain knowledge on how the unique environments of each hospital setting
interacts with the CDS tool and how to refine the tool for large-scale dissemination, including rural and
resource-poor environments, on a national scale."

Through experienced leadership, continued strategic investment, and dedicated infrastructure support, the
Massey Cancer Center (MCC) has spearheaded cancer-focused education, training, and professional
development at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) for over a decade. As a new formal Cancer Center
Support Grant (CCSG) component, MCC’s Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC)
efforts 1) attract diverse individuals to the field of oncology, from middle and high school on through progressing
educational levels across an interdisciplinary spectrum of biomedical and biobehavioral professionals; 2) provide
engaging, contemporary oncology education and training opportunities; and 3) equip, through effective
mentoring, emerging and early-stage investigators with the skills needed for successful cancer-related research
careers. Devanand Sarkar, MBBS, PhD, Associate Director for Research Training and Education, oversees the
development and evaluation of MCC-driven CRTEC activities and a recently established MCC Office of CRTEC,
staffed with individuals who support the growing number of programs and events. A faculty-level Research
Training and Education Advisory Committee and starting in late Summer of 2022 the MCC Student and Trainee
Advancing Research Council will provide input into CRTEC efforts, identifying gaps and assisting in developing
innovative concepts for programming to fill them. In 2021, through customized programs and individual
mentorship, MCC members supported education and career development for 344 individuals across the learner
continuum. Given that MCC emphasizes diversity in the developing workforce, collectively over the project
period, more than 19% of the students/trainees are from underrepresented minority (URM) populations, and
60% are female. Fueled by significant MCC investments in the current CCSG project period, the MCC enhanced
and expanded cancer career enhancement activities with numerous MCC-driven initiatives, several receiving
extramural funding. Selected examples include 1) converting a longstanding NCI-funded R25 to an NCI T32
training grant in Cancer Prevention and Control and Health Equity; 2) launching an innovative curriculum for the
Cancer and Molecular Medicine doctoral concentration with support from an NCI R25 curriculum development
award focused on clinical research methodology, incorporating community engagement into research, and
cancer bioinformatics; 3) initiating an MCC Faculty Development Research Program in 2020 for junior
investigators who are paired with MCC investigators and provided guided opportunities for career development
awards and pilot research funding, notably from the American Cancer Society-Institutional Research Grant,
which has been sustained at VCU for over 50 years; and 4) participating in a four-year NCI P20 Partnership in
Addressing Cancer Health Equity award (awarded September 2021), bringing together MCC and Virginia State
University, a Historically Black University, to educate, train, and mentor faculty and students in launching new
cancer disparities research initiatives."
10850915,"PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) Director Robert A. Winn, MD,
established an Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) in early 2021 to assist with further diversifying
the MCC workforce and developing a stronger, more equitable, and inclusive culture to conduct cancer research
that benefits all. Winn empowered the ODEI to synergistically drive MCC faculty and staff recruitment and
retention efforts with the MCC’s Human Resource Office to increase diversity as well as promote diverse
leadership development within the MCC. ODEI also collaborates with the MCC Offices of Community Outreach
and Engagement (COE) and Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination to synergistically promote
an inclusive and supportive environment for faculty, staff, student/trainees, and its external advisors. These
efforts align with MCC’s 2021-2025 Strategic Plan and the National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support
Grant priorities aiming to promote diverse perspectives among those who are addressing the nation’s cancer
burden and address well-documented workforce gaps among certain racial/ethnic, geographic, sex/gender, and
socioeconomic populations. This can only be accomplished by ensuring that diverse teams of faculty scientists
and leaders, staff, students, and advisors have equitable input into new approaches and solutions. Led by the
Associate Director for DEI, Emmanuel A. Taylor, DrPH, and supported by senior, staff-level DEI Operations
Director, Tremayne D. Robertson, they work collaboratively with MCC, VCU, and VCU Health senior leadership
to implement more equitable hiring practices and promote a culture that is inclusive of all voices. The ODEI will
attract an increasingly diverse pool of talent for MCC consideration, assist with partnership building with other
minority-serving institutions to reach underrepresented populations, inform and promote career enhancement
and leadership development pathways, develop and refine DEI policies that drive diversity across MCC, and
establish methodologies to monitor and evaluate progress. Collectively this work ensures that the MCC
workforce best reflects the diversity of the catchment area it serves as well as the nation."

The overall goal of our research is to reduce HIV-related health inequities among Latinx immigrant populations.
We propose to determine the effectiveness of Hermanos de Luna y Sol (HLS), a community-based, group
intervention delivered in Spanish, designed to reduce HIV sexual risk among Latinx immigrants who identify as
gay/bisexual men or men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The study is designed as a quasi-experimental,
community control, with Oakland, CA as the intervention group and Chicago, IL as the control. Assessments
will be conducted at -3 and 0 mos., and follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 mos. Participants (N=360; n=180 per city)
will be recruited using Time-location sampling (a venue-based sampling designed to reduce sample bias).
HLS, the intervention at the heart of this study, offers several novel features: it focuses on immigrant, Spanish-
speaking populations; it addresses racism and homophobia as factors shaping HIV risk; and uses a
community-based approach centered on community involvement (e.g., civic participation, volunteering) as a
means to foster sexual health and community building.
The study will help identify effective interventions to prevent HIV among Latinx immigrant GBMSM, a
marginalized population for which HIV preventive interventions are severely lacking. This study capitalizes on
an existing intervention designed for Spanish speaking populations; is the first of its kind to rigorously test the
intervention’s effectiveness among Latinx immigrant GBMSM using a community control design. The study
applies the best possible scientific approach to obtain estimates of intervention effectiveness. If successful, the
intervention would be relatively easy to disseminate via community organizations and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Ultimately, the study will help move forward efforts to reduce racial/ethnic health
inequities, one of the nation’s major public health priorities.
This proposal is directly relevant to the RFA on Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and
Advance Health Equity at Minority serving Institutions. The project is led by SFSU – a Hispanic Serving
Institution-- in collaboration with two Latinx community-based organizations: La Familia and Chicago Queer
Latinx Collaborative. We are a multidisciplinary research team with the depth and breadth of experience on
HIV prevention with Latinx and GBMSM communities to successfully conduct the study. All senior personnel
are of Latin American descent, fully bilingual (Spanish and English), and three of them are women. The
proposed study is strongly aligned with NIH UNITED Initiative of fostering racial equity and inclusion in
biomedical research and is responsive to priority areas of multiple NIH institutes and centers, such NIMHD,
NIMH, and the Office of AIDS Research."
10843095,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gene expression is closely monitored to ensure fidelity in the conversion of genetic information into biological
activity. In eukaryotic cells a specialized quality control checkpoint exists during mRNA translation to evaluate
mRNA integrity and rapidly degrade transcripts containing a nonsense codon in their protein-coding region - a
signal that causes premature termination of translation and, if left unchecked, the accumulation of truncated
polypeptides. This pathway, referred to as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), serves a vital biological
function by protecting cells from the deleterious consequences of incomplete proteins. In spite of over two
decades of study, fundamental questions central to this process remain poorly resolved, including how cells
distinguish normal and premature translation termination and what molecular events occur subsequently
between the translating mRNA and NMD machinery to incite accelerated degradation of the nonsense codon-
containing transcript. The long term objective of my research is to gain a comprehensive molecular
understanding of the events underlying the cell's ability to recognize and target nonsense-containing mRNA for
rapid decay.
In the last decade, we have made seminal discoveries in characterizing RNA features vital for the recognition
and efficient targeting of an mRNA to NMD. Recently, we have begun to dissect molecular events subsequent
to substrate recognition through identifying the complement of proteins specifically associated with nonsense-
containing mRNA and characterizing a catalytically-inactive mutant of the key NMD factor, UFP1. Notably, we
have described a functional interaction between the NMD machinery and prematurely terminating ribosomes
that exists in vivo and which is critical for dictating the fate of the aberrant transcript. We propose here to
capitalize on our past efforts and exploit novel tools and reagents to i) identify UPF1 RNA binding targets
globally to provide unprecedented insight into how NMD factor binding dictates the targeting of mRNA to NMD;
ii) interrogate further the functional interaction between prematurely terminating ribosomes and the NMD
machinery essential for targeting substrates to rapid decay; and iii) monitor NMD mRNP dynamics in vivo using
enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling. Together, these studies will provide unprecedented insight into the
molecular events underlying an integral cellular RNA quality control pathway and regulator of gene expression."
10849797,"Abstract:
Recent evidence has emerged that microbes resident in the human intestine represent a
key transmissible environmental factor contributing to a number of human diseases
including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, mechanisms
by which gut microbial-derived factors signal to the host to promote these diseases are
largely unknown. We have recently discovered a metaorganismal pathway where
nutrients present in high fat foods (phosphatidylcholine, choline, and L-carnitine) can be
metabolized by the gut microbial enzymes to generate trimethylamine (TMA), which is
then further metabolized by the host enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 3
(FMO3) to produce trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Here we show that pharmacologic
inhibition of the gut microbial choline TMA lyase enzyme CutC/D protects mice against
the metabolic disturbances associated with a high fat diet. Unexpectedly, this protection
is associated with reorganization of host circadian control of both phosphatidylcholine
and energy metabolism. These studies described in this proposal will be significant
because they have the potential to uncover the first ever described diet-microbe-derived
zeitgeber. Successful completion of this project will be transformative by providing proof
of concept that a non-antibiotic drug targeting a specific microbial enzyme can serve as
a therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with circadian disruption."
10888136,"Targeting RNA with small molecules with the pharmacological properties of
successful drugs would open-up an untapped universe of pharmaceutical targets
within mRNAs and ncRNAs. However, the successful discovery of potent and cell-active
inhibitors of RNA requires a fundamental understanding of RNA recognition by small
molecules. This knowledge is largely missing, because there are very few examples
(<10) in the academic and patent literature of small molecules that bind to RNA potently
(nM) and specifically and that also possess drug-like chemistry.
 In the first 4 years of this MIRA project, we have discovered a class of drug-
like molecules that bind to several RNAs with nanomolar affinity and specificity.
This breakthrough opens-up an exceptional opportunity to investigate the
fundamental principles of RNA recognition. The very broad impact and significance of
the discovery is validated, in addition to 22 academic publications and 2 patents, by a
spin-off which licensed the use of the chemistry in oncology, vetted by luminaire
medicinal chemists, credited together with the development of 4 blockbuster drugs.
 The premise of this continuation is that a fundamental understanding of the
principles of molecular recognition of RNA by these drug-like small molecules, of
the structural, chemical, energetic and dynamic properties that lead to potent binding and
specificity, would allow us to identify additional privileged scaffolds for RNA, and to
discover potent inhibitors of replication of pathogenic RNA viruses.
 To achieve this goal, we will dissect RNA-small molecule recognition through 3D
structure determination and investigations of the chemistry, thermodynamics and
dynamics of binding. We will also develop the chemistry we have discovered to address
unmet clinical needs in addressing infections by Dengue and Zika viruses, where
vaccination has so far been unsuccessful. We will collaborate with infectious disease
biologists to conduct experiments in cells and model organisms to examine anti-
viral activity in biologically meaningful contexts and demonstrate cellular RNA
engagement."

10911784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The work in this proposal builds on our expertise in catalytic stereoselective glycosylations to result in
efficient synthetic methodologies for construction of the challenging glycosidic bonds. We recently
discovered that readily available phenanthrolines, rigid and planar organic compound with two pyridine
rings fused to a benzene ring, effectively act as nucleophilic catalysts to promote stereoselective 1,2-
cis glycosylation reactions of alcohol nucleophiles with both pyranosyl and furanosyl bromide donors.
The phenanthroline catalytic system provides efficient access to a myriad of 1,2-cis pyranosides and
furanosides bearing the C2-oxygen, -azido and -fluoro functional groups under mild and operationally
simple conditions. The phenanthroline-catalyzed methodologies represent long standing synthetic
challenges for highly desirable glycosylations to generate biologically important oligosaccharides and
glycopeptides to advance an understanding of their biological functions. In this R35 grant, we continue
uncovering the simplicity and versatility of phenanthroline catalysts to provide a new principle for the
stereoselective construction of the challenging α-2-deoxy glycosides. Precisely tailored phenanthroline
catalysts can activate both the alcohol nucleophile and the glycosyl halide electrophile simultaneously.
We will also investigate the dual activation mechanism of the phenanthroline catalysts to control site-
selective coupling of polyol nucleophiles and chemoselective coupling of the hydroxyl of serine residue
in the presence of the thiol of cysteine-containing peptides. Further, we will apply the phenanthroline
catalyst platform to the synthesis of heparan sulfate-like oligosaccharides as inhibitors of heparanase,
which is a druggable target for anticancer therapy. We will also develop the library of heparan sulfate
mimetics with all of the possible O- and N-sulfation motifs from readily available aminoglycosides to
advance an understanding of the role of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in many biological systems. In
particular, we will investigate these structurally well-defined heparan sulfate mimetics as the potential
binders of clinically important fibroblast growth factors."
10827470,"Abstract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by overproduction of mucus in the lungs
followed by chronic lung infections. Conventional wisdom has been that most CF lung infections involve a
single dominant organism, most commonly the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Advances in
culture-independent techniques have revealed that CF lung infections are rarely mono-microbial and instead
usually involve complex microbial communities, yet the interspecies interactions that drive these communities
are poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that polymicrobial infections are
more difficult than mono-microbial infections to eradicate with antibiotics, leading to the concept of recalcitrant
communities. The mechanisms underlying recalcitrance are thought to involve synergistic interactions between
community members, but very little data are available to understand this phenomenon. Combined with the
realization that many CF patients respond poorly to available antibiotic regimens compels a more detailed
understanding of interspecies interactions and their impacts on antibiotic recalcitrance to improve the treatment
of CF infections, as well as other polymicrobial diseases. Here, we combine big-data bioinformatics, in silico
computational modeling and in vitro culture experiments to gain insights into the metabolic interactions that
drive CF disease outcomes and antibiotic recalcitrance. The research will leverage an available data set of
hundreds of CF patient samples that provide both bacterial composition data and clinical metadata, including
measures of lung function. These samples will be clustered according to their measured compositions and
metabolic capabilities predicted through computational metabolic modeling to test the hypothesis that the vast
complexity of these many bacterial communities can be collapsed into a small number of model communities
that capture most of the observed metabolic variability. These computational predictions will be tested by
developing in vitro cell culture models that recapitulate the most important metabolic features of the in vivo
polymicrobial communities (Aim 1). By applying bioinformatics and modeling to the same clinical data, we will
test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive disease outcomes and the virulence potential of
these communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will interrogate the clinical data and in vitro communities to test the
hypothesis that community metabolic features drive antibiotic recalcitrance and differentiate community
responsiveness to antibiotics according to these metabolic features (Aim 3). Our research will yield novel
insights into how complex polymicrobial communities are compositionally structured, interact metabolically,
contribute to disease and respond to antibiotics. Moreover, the research will validate in vitro models that offer
the potential for development of novel antimicrobial strategies to better treat chronic, polymicrobial infections in
CF and other diseases. Our transdisciplinary team offers the necessary expertise in bioinformatics,
computational modeling, microbial physiology and CF polymicrobial infections to tackle this complex problem."

Due to the rapidly growing importance of antibody-mediated drug delivery, there is a critical need for simple and
efficient site-specific conjugation techniques that do not require extensive antibody engineering efforts. Moreover,
there is significant need to identify sites of conjugation that are protected from plasma enzymes and are useful for
the attachment of hydrophobic payloads. The goal of this proposal is to optimize conjugation technology at the
conserved Q295 residue in order to meet these challenges. In contrast to most sites of conjugation, the Q295 site is
contained within a large hydrophobic cavity that is sterically shielded from plasma and is particularly amenable to the
conjugation of large nonpolar payloads. Remarkably, the properties of this hydrophobic pocket are largely unexplored
to-date and our preliminary research shows that there are significant untapped opportunities for exploiting the unique
features of this site. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the broad utility of this site-specific conjugation
technology through the preparation and evaluation of antibody conjugates for oncology, immunology, and imaging
applications. We will accomplish this goal through the achievement of three aims. Aim#1 focuses on developing a
thorough molecular understanding of the local environment around the Q295 residue and optimizing linkers that can
place the payload within the associated hydrophobic pocket. The goal of this aim is to thoroughly understand the
chemical properties of the hydrophobic pocket that surrounds the Q295 moiety. Aim#2 focuses on demonstrating the
therapeutic utility of this technology through the preparation of ADCs that deliver a wide range of payloads –
particularly focusing on payloads that have exhibited difficulties when attached through traditional (“stochastic”)
conjugation approaches. Four particular payloads were selected: MMAE (due to its clinical relevance and known linker
stability issues), Tubulysin (due to interest in payloads with low PGP efflux and also a labile ester functionality that has
caused problems with traditional approaches), Thailanstatin A (due to its unique mechanism of action and to the labile
functional groups in its structure), and Brequinar (due to its potency as an immunosuppressive agent and its very high
hydrophobicity that has so-far prevented ADC delivery). The resulting B-cell targeting ADCs will be thoroughly evaluated
for their pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy in a B-cell xenograft model. Aim#3 focuses on using the Q295 site for
the development of Raman imaging probes that can be used for generating live-cell time lapse images. Importantly,
there have been no reported attempts to use Raman imaging to study ADC trafficking. Traditional ADC conjugation
methods cannot be employed for the attachment of the Raman tags due to their very high hydrophobicity. Successful
achievement of these aims will provide the drug-delivery community with a valuable new tool for site-specific
conjugation of problematic payloads and will establish new imaging techniques for the study of ADC trafficking and
catabolism."
10840288,"Project Summary
Flavivirus are major mosquito-borne pathogens infecting millions of people worldwide each year. Currently there
is no antiviral therapy available for treating West Nile, Dengue and Zika viral infections. The first vaccine CYD-
TDV (Dengvaxia) against DENV was approved last year but shows only 56% overall efficacy against the four
dengue serotypes. The flaviviral two-component NS2B/NS3 protease is required for viral replication and thus an
attractive antiviral target. However, extensive screening and rational design efforts have failed to identify any
clinically viable inhibitors at this point. Two key factors have likely contributed to the challenge. First, traditional
screening efforts rely primarily on binding affinity to predict the drug efficacy. Yet, increasing evidence has
emerged to show that the residence time of drug-target interaction is a more reliable predictor of in vivo
pharmacological activity. These kinetic rate parameters are generally not available during early stages of drug
discovery. Second, NS2B/NS3 proteases display complex conformational dynamics during function and
inhibition, which is still poorly understood. This project aims to develop a new label-free single molecular
approach to resolve the conformational states of NS2B/NS3 proteases. Key to the approach is the use of an
innovative nanopore tweezers where the protease is confined with the pore lumen, allowing dynamic structural
changes during substrate or inhibitor binding to be continuously monitored by current fluctuation signals. Analysis
of the current traces will provide a complete profile of binding affinity and kinetic rates as well as the distribution
of conformational states. Specifically, we will first build a nanopore tweezers tool set that is readily tunable for
trapping various flaviviral proteases. Secondly, we will track and analyze the functional states of the NS2B/NS3
protease in the presence of various substrates. Influence of critical residues, substrate, construct design on the
dynamic equilibrium between the “open” and “closed” states will be assessed to provide insight into the
mechanism of protease activity. Finally, the nanopore tweezers will be deployed to determine the structural
dynamics and binding thermodynamics and kinetics profiles of NS2B/NS3 interacting with various inhibitors.
Once the inhibition profiles are established, the nanopore tweezers confined NS2B/NS3 system will be tested
for screening a diverse compound library to identity novel allosteric inhibitors with improved drug-like properties
compared to active-site inhibitors. This work will provide unprecedented kinetic information on the function-
structural dynamics relationship of NS2B/NS3 complex and mechanisms of substrate binding and inhibition, as
well as establish a new paradigm for high-throughput drug screening that is independent of enzymatic activity."
10845287,"Project Summary & Abstract
 Individuals with brain injuries or disorders that affect movement (such as Parkinson’s disease, cerebral
palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and many others) often have difficulties in being understood when they
speak. While treatments exist, they often require substantial conscious attention to the way speech is
produced, or require increased breath support to speak louder. Many individuals with speech disorders have
cognitive or respiratory difficulty that renders these treatments ineffective. These individuals will benefit from
alternative strategies that promote motor learning: the ability to alter motor actions through practice. One type
of motor learning, sensorimotor adaptation, is a particularly promising pathway for alternative rehabilitation. In
this paradigm, the auditory feedback people receive while speaking is externally perturbed, causing them to
quickly change their speech to oppose these perturbations. Because of its ability to rapidly induce changes in
speech production without conscious control, sensorimotor adaptation holds unique promise for rehabilitation.
However, its potential clinical applicability is limited by poor understanding of key clinically-relevant features.
 First, existing sensorimotor adaptation paradigms do not affect speech in a way that facilitates
communication. To improve rehabilitation outcomes, sensorimotor learning must target clinically-relevant
speech parameters such as intelligibility. We address this barrier through a novel auditory perturbation that
artificially decreases the perceived space between vowels, causing speakers to produce more vowel contrast.
Critically, reduced vowel contrast is a hallmark of motor speech disorders and significantly contributes to
decreased intelligibility. We determine the effectiveness of this paradigm to increase intelligibility and test how
these increases are retained across multiple training sessions, how they generalize to untrained words, and
how they can be elicited in complex sentences—characteristics which are key for potential clinical applications.
 Second, while sensorimotor adaptation is a robust effect on average, not all individuals learn to the
same degree. This variability limits the potential impact to only those who show a large degree of learning. This
proposal uses behavioral interventions and brain stimulation that target the hypothesized causes of this
variability. By directly manipulating these factors, we can determine, for the first time, the mechanisms that
underlie speech motor learning. Additionally, establishing how these factors can be modulated to increase
learning would allow treatment to benefit a wider range of individuals.
 Although sensorimotor adaptation can quickly induce changes in speech, its current clinical applicability
is limited by substantial gaps in our understanding of its mechanisms. By establishing the capacity of
sensorimotor adaptation to increase speech intelligibility, characterizing retention and transfer of learning, and
identifying the mechanisms underlying variability between individuals, this work lays a critical foundation for
future treatments that optimize the clinical impact of motor learning."

10866391,"PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT
PI: Ross Levine, MD
Primary myelofibrosis (MF) and progression of polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocytosis (ET) to MF
represent the most pressing clinical needs of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), given that MF
patients develop progressive cytopenias, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis, disabling systemic symptoms
and/or transformation to a treatment refractory form of acute leukemia, termed MPN-blast phase. The
identification of somatic activating mutations involving the JAK2, MPL and CALR genes in most MPN/MF patients
has underscored the role of constitutive JAK-STAT signaling in MF pathogenesis and has led to the clinical
development of JAK2 inhibitors as the standard of care for MF patients. Clinical experience with currently
available JAK2 inhibitors has shown that these agents can reduce cytokine production and attenuate MPN
symptoms but are not capable of inducing either pathologic or molecular responses in most patients. Our recent
work has uncovered a role for key epigenetic and inflammatory pathways in MF pathogenesis, which cooperate
with activated JAK-STAT signaling to drive clinical progression and adverse outcomes in MF patients. These
newly identified epigenetic and inflammatory pathways provide mechanistic insights into MPN disease
pathogenesis and have the potential to serve as targets for the development of novel MF therapeutic approaches.
We propose to investigate the role of aberrant epigenetic/inflammatory effector pathways in MF pathogenesis
and to identify novel therapeutic targets which cooperate with JAK2 inhibition to increase therapeutic efficacy.
The studies in this project will leverage novel, genetically accurate murine models of the most common MPN
genotypes, coupled with detailed genomic, epigenomic, and therapeutic studies of primary samples from the
MPN-RC Tissue Bank (Core B). Most importantly, the studies in this project are aimed to develop and credential
novel therapeutic approaches that can then be transitioned to the clinic for mechanism based clinical trials in
collaboration with Project 4 and the entire MPN-RC."
10866396,"PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT
PIs: John Crispino, PhD; Anna Rita Migliaccio, PhD
Myelofibrosis (MF), caused by mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR, progress from a pre-fibrotic stage where
patients have minimal symptoms to a more advanced fibrotic state which is associated with an increasing
symptom burden, progressive splenomegaly, cytopenias and marrow fibrosis. MF disease progression is
characterized by the accumulation of atypical megakaryocytes that express low levels of the critical transcription
factor GATA1 and elevated levels of TGF-β. MF evolves to acute myeloid leukemia (MPN blast phase, MPN-
BP) in nearly 20% of patients. The goal of project 2 is to understand the events that contribute to disease
progression by focusing on megakaryocytes and the factors that they secrete, such as TGF-β and IL-13. Based
on our prior research, we hypothesize that changes in the megakaryocytic lineage substantially contribute to key
features of MF progression, including bone marrow fibrosis, the predominance of MF hematopoietic stem cells
and the impaired function of wild-type hematopoietic stem cells. We further hypothesize that alterations in p53
activity contribute to both the inhibition of normal hematopoiesis and the progression of MF to MPN-BP. In this
project, we will: 1) Investigate the changes in the megakaryocyte lineage that contribute to the MF progression;
2) Identify the contributions of IL-13 and TGF-β to MF progression; and 3) Evaluate and target the contributions
of HIF-1 alpha pathway activation and p53 inhibition driving MF leukemia progression. Our research interacts
with Projects 1 and 3 through our work on cytokines and the role of p53 in MF progression, and with Project 4
through both bench to beside and bedside to bench exchanges of information, with the ultimate goal of bringing
new treatments to MF patients. Our work will also require integration with each of the MPN-RC cores. Drs.
Crispino and Migliaccio have a longstanding history of collaboration, particularly dealing with the role of GATA1
in megakaryopoiesis, and will leverage their complementary expertise to achieve the goals of this project."
10866402,"PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT
PI: Ronald Hoffman, MD
First generation JAK2 inhibitor therapy is currently widely employed to treat myelofibrosis (MF) patients. Its use,
however, has not substantially altered the risk for disease progression or interrupted the inevitable evolution to
MPN-blast phase (MPN-BP), likely due to an inability to selectively deplete MF stem/progenitor cells (HSPC).
MF HSPCs are characterized by upregulation of HDM2 which promotes the proteosomal degradation of wild-
type (WT) p53. We have focused on implementing strategies that upregulate WT p53 activity in order to deplete
MF HSPCs. We subsequently have shown that treatment with the HDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3 antagonizes the
interaction between WT p53 and HDM2 resulting in the upregulation of p53 and the depletion of MF but not
normal HSCs. Furthermore, p53 dependent signaling is known to play a role in tumor suppression by acting in a
non-cell autonomous manner, such that down regulation of p53 leads to upregulation of NFκB resulting in the
increased elaboration of abundant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Subsequent trials of nutlin therapy in
MPN patients have resulted in an improvement not only in clinical parameters and symptom scores but also
rapid reductions in the variant allele frequencies of MPN driver mutations and other associated myeloid gene
mutations, as well as the reversal of marrow fibrosis. We hypothesize that HDM2 antagonist therapy actually
depletes MF HSPCs and downregulates NFκB in MF cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. The
long-term administration of HDM2 antagonists has, however, proven problematic due to gastrointestinal toxicity.
MPN p53 activity can also be downregulated by activating mutations or overexpression of PPM1D, a
phosphatase which dephosphorylates p53. To further optimize the therapeutic upregulation of WT p53 and
possibly lessen the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with HDM2 antagonist therapy, we hypothesize that
adding drugs that either reduce PPMID activity or antagonize the action of BET proteins (epigenetic regulators
which downregulate events downstream of p53) will result in further upregulation of p53 activity, greater depletion
of MF HSPCs and additional correction of the MF tumor microenvironment. Since HDM2 can also be recruited
to chromatin in a p53 independent manner to increase NFκB, HIF1α, and polycomb repressor complex 2 activity,
as well as orchestrate the global metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, we hypothesize that agents that
effectively eliminate both the p53 dependent and independent consequences of increased HDM2 copy number,
might result in even greater depletion of MF HSPCs. To test these hypotheses, we will pursue the following
Specific Aims (1) Determine the degree of malignant MF HSCs depletion achieved by up-regulating WT p53
activity with single agent HDM2 antagonist treatment; (2) Determine if dual targeting of HDM2 and PPM1D or
HDM2 and BRD4 leads to further upregulation of p53 activity and a greater degree of MF HSC depletion than
targeting HDM2 alone; and (3) Evaluate if targeting the p53 independent roles, in addition to the p53 dependent
roles, of HDM2 leads to further depletion of MF HSCs."

This application is in response to the NIH Common Fund Transformative Research to Address Health
Disparities and Advance Health Equity at Minority Serving Institutions (RFA-RM-22-001). The objective of
this project is to implement a scalable task-sharing model aimed at building capacity and supporting a racially
diverse workforce of non-specialist providers to deliver brief interventions for the indicated prevention and early
intervention for depression and anxiety, combined with new content tailored to the local context in low resource,
racial and ethnically diverse settings with emphasis on assessing and addressing the social determinants of
mental health in these communities, ultimately contributing to the reduction of disparities in their communities.
We will do so by recruiting from the undergraduate student population at a Minority Serving Institution in Texas,
one of the most under-resourced states for mental health care and deploying an innovative suite of digital
solutions to train, supervise and support these providers to deliver evidence based, brief, quality assured
psychosocial interventions. The intervention, designed through a systematic process of co-production with
students, and collaboration with community specialists, will aim to achieve trans-diagnostic intervention for
common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. The long-term goal of the project is the
creation of resources, opportunities, structure, and scaffolding that will establish a robust community mental
health care system, through deployment of providers, trained and certified as Community Health Workers
(CHWs) for scaling up and building capacity for delivery of interventions to shift mental health care away from
specialty care toward high-frequency, low-cost interventions in the communities where the providers live.
Increasing the number of providers who reflect the demographics of the community they are serving is key to
addressing gaps in care as well as addressing social determinants of mental health and disparities in access to
care among minority groups.5 We propose to leverage EMPOWER, a platform developed by Patel and Naslund4
at Harvard Medical School with support from the National Institute of Mental Health (U19MH113211), to train
non-specialist undergraduate social work students, facilitate peer supervision for support and quality assurance,
and provide consultation and real time support to certified CHWs in the community. The EMPOWER curriculum
consists of evidence-based psychosocial interventions covering foundational counseling skills and behavioral
activation and will be augmented with training content focused on recognizing and addressing the social
determinants of disparities in mental health. Central to our implementation plan and sustainability strategy is to
leverage the infrastructure of the Lone Star Depression Challenge, a statewide effort in partnership with the
EMPOWER program which will engage, train, and deploy CHWs to health systems to reduce barriers for all
Texans with depression, detect their needs earlier, and care for them more effectively, while also prioritizing and
engaging people of color, individuals with disabilities, and those living in poverty."

The primary focus of my laboratory is the development of new tools and strategies for proteomic analyses of
complex biological systems, specifically centered around the concept of the proteoform. Proteoforms, each of
which comprises a unique combination of amino acid sequence and post-translational modifications (PTMs),
are the primary molecular effectors of cell function. Subtle sequence and PTM differences between
proteoforms can completely alter their function and activity. We see comprehensive proteoform-level analysis
of biological systems as absolutely essential to understanding their function, for both individual pathways and
networks operative within cells, and more globally, to decipher the systems-biology-level dynamics and
interactions that control cellular response. The current technology for global proteoform analysis in complex
systems is in its infancy, offering both a great challenge and a great opportunity. Our laboratory is keenly
interested in tackling this problem and is pioneering a new approach that integrates high resolution proteoform
intact mass measurements, both bottom-up and top-down strategies, new informatic tools for the
comprehensive analysis of PTMs, and RNA-Seq information; all woven together in a robust bioinformatic
framework to allow the comprehensive identification and quantification of proteoforms in complex mixtures.
Along with other world-class scientists, we will work towards embarking on the Human Proteoform Project,
which includes ambitious subprojects describing the construction and utility of comprehensive proteoform
atlases for humans and model organisms. Specific projects in our laboratory will include development of the
following: (1) a multi-dimensional separation strategy for increased breadth and depth of proteoform
identifications; (2) a source-induced dissociation method for fragmentation of eluting proteoform ions to
increase proteoform identifications; (3) intelligent real-time data acquisition; (4) direct acquisition of orbitrap
time-domain transients to expand the accessible mass range; (5) data analysis software including the abilities
to search for truncated proteoforms and utilize the most abundant mass for identification; (6) sample-specific
databases created through integration of bottom-up, top-down, intact mass and RNA-Seq data; (7)
visualization tools for manual validation of proteoform identifications and for troubleshooting problems with
samples and/or algorithms; and (8) using proteoform quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to reveal the modifying
enzymes encoded elsewhere in the genome that are responsible for the critical post-translational modifications
with functional consequence. We are excited to develop powerful new tools to advance the state-of-the-art in
this new and important field of study to reveal the biologically important effectors of cellular mechanisms.
These tools, which will be made widely available to all researchers, will reveal new information essential to the
understanding of both normal and disease biology, deepening and accelerating the study of human disease
processes."

 The homes of millions of older Americans do not provide adequate protection from extreme temperatures,
due in large part to “energy poverty.” Modifications to homes that increase energy efficiency and improve
indoor temperatures may reduce the adverse neuropsychological health impacts of extreme temperatures.
Indoor temperatures may impact sleep quality and short-term cognitive function, and high utility bills may
exacerbate the psychosocial stress of financial worry. Some of the health benefits of weatherization have been
previously characterized, including reductions in emergency department visits related to asthma. We propose
to evaluate the health and financial impacts of low-cost and higher-cost weatherization programs, considering
the novel or under-studied outcomes of financial worry, cognitive function, and sleep quality and duration. We
propose to enroll three categories of participants: those of a low-cost weatherization program in a cold climate
(Detroit, MI), those of a high-cost weatherization program in a cold climate (Madison, WI), and those of a high-
cost weatherization program in a warm climate (Memphis, TN). In a longitudinal study with sleep cycle
measurements (actigraphy), multiple surveys and sub-hourly indoor temperature and humidity monitoring per
person over one year of participation, we aim to characterize 1) associations of indoor temperatures with
cognitive function and sleep quality and duration and 2) associations of low- and high-cost weatherization
programs with indoor environmental parameters (temperature, humidity) and financial worry. In aim 3), we will
characterize the monetized health impacts of low- and high-cost weatherization programs in terms of both
community-wide air pollution benefits (related to reduced energy consumption) and recipient-specific health
benefits identified in previous research and any benefits from aims 1 and 2. This research will advance our
long-term objectives of reducing the health impacts of extreme weather, characterizing the health impacts of
the home environment, and reducing disparities in the health impacts of energy generation and use. This
research will inform policies for energy efficiency and weatherization subsidies, considering that medical
savings from expenditures on housing upgrades would potentially reduce state- or federally-subsidized
healthcare expenditures. Such interventions may improve the health of older adults via improvements to indoor
temperatures and reductions in utility costs and help households both mitigate (through decreased energy
usage) and adapt to extreme weather."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the world, but many other diseases of the brain can
also cause cognitive decline. Unfortunately, these diseases have overlapping clinical signs and symptoms, and
they often coexist in older individuals with dementia. These circumstances greatly complicate our overarching
mission “to prevent and treat Alzheimer disease and related dementias by 2025” (the primary objective of the
National Plan to Address Alzheimer Disease [NAPA]). To accomplish this mission, we must first: (1) improve
our ability to distinguish and diagnose specific individual brain diseases in living participants; and (2) understand
the pathophysiological mechanisms through which these diseases develop and lead to dementia.
In this effort, studies of postmortem brain tissue are indispensable. Comprehensive brain examination can
establish not only whether a person had AD and how advanced that AD pathology had become, but can also
detect and measure the severity of other neurodegenerative diseases that can mimic and/or coincide with AD.
Just as important, scientific studies of postmortem brain specimens can facilitate the development and testing
of new brain scans (neuroimaging biomarker compounds) in ways that are not possible in living participants,
and can reveal new secrets about the pathophysiology of AD and related dementias.
The mission of the Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) Neuropathology Core (NPC) is to collect,
process, analyze, store, and distribute autopsy brain tissue from study participants to support the Specific Aims
of the ADRC and other scientists around the world, as we all strive to prevent and treat AD and related
dementias. Towards this end, the NPC examines brains for signs of pathology (including the amounts and
distributions of neuronal loss, gliosis, vascular disease sequela, and deposits of abnormal disease-associated
proteins [Aβ, hyperphosphorylated tau, alpha-synuclein, and pTDP-43]). These detailed studies enable us to
communicate appropriate diagnoses to the families of participant brain donors, and to supply appropriate data
and tissues to scientific collaborators. These collaborations allow the correlation of clinical, neuroimaging,
biochemical, and molecular features to neuropathologic features of AD and related dementias."
10843955,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a complex, heterogeneous complication of diabetes that is characterized by
progressive renal decline. While genetic factors are known to contribute to DN susceptibility, despite intense
effort, the identification of variants that underlie its risk has been challenging, largely due to the scarcity of well-
characterized cohorts designed to investigate the genetic basis of rapid renal decline. To overcome this
bottleneck, we’ve developed an innovative family-based approach to accelerate gene discovery in DN that
integrates unparalleled resources, including the Utah Diabetes Database (UDDb), which contains electronic
medical record data for more than 350,000 diabetic patients, the Utah Population Database, a unique
population-based genealogy resource containing family histories and demographic data for 14 million
individuals, and the Intermountain Biorepository, a large biorepository containing biospecimens for 147,000
patients in the UDDb. Using these resources, we’ve established one of the world’s largest and well-
characterized cohorts of diabetic patients with rapid progression of renal decline and identified >450 large,
multigenerational pedigrees enriched for this key feature of DN. As part of a recent pilot study applying our
approach, we identified putative disease-causing variants in 2 genes (ADIPOQ and FRAS1) not previously
known to contribute to DN. These strong preliminary findings highlight the power of family-based genetics to
discover novel genes that contribute to rapid renal decline and DN. We believe that these studies are just the
‘tip of the iceberg’ and that additional predisposing genes and pathways remain to be discovered. To further
advance this research, we will 1) define the pathophysiological mechanisms through which ADIPOQ and
FRAS1 affect rapid progression of renal decline in DN families by i) examining the role of ADIPOQ mutation on
renal decline and DN development using genetically edited mice (mice carrying the human mutation identified
in a high-risk pedigree have already been generated) and ii) examining the role of FRAS1 mutation on renal
decline and DN development using genetically edited mice. 2) Establish a comprehensive catalog of coding
variation in DN families enriched for rapid progression of renal decline by i) prioritizing high-risk pedigrees
enriched for rapid renal decline using innovative tools developed at the University of Utah and identifying select
individuals from these families to optimize WES-based gene discovery and ii) performing WES-based gene
discovery in newly identified high-risk pedigrees enriched for rapid renal decline. 3) Evaluate the causal
relationship between genetic variants identified in DN families enriched for rapid progression of renal decline
and rapid renal decline by i) prioritizing candidate genes discovered using WES to identify the most promising
candidates using statistical and biological evidence and ii) performing in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate
the biological impact of prioritized candidate genes. Combined, the proposed research will significantly
advance our understanding of the genetics and biology of DN and rapid renal decline."

The innate immune system is the critical first line of defense against pathogenic infections. In the context of
viral infections, activation of the innate immune response is key to controlling viral replication and eliminating
the infection. However, overactivation of this response can lead to systemic hyperinflammation and significant
morbidity and mortality. Recently, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has emerged, leading to the disease
COVID-19 and a global pandemic. Targeted therapeutic strategies are critically lacking, and there is limited
understanding of the role of innate immune responses in this disease. Clinical data show that patients with
COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm and significant tissue damage, both of which contribute to disease
severity and mortality. Recent work from our group showed that increased TNF-α and IFN-γ levels following
SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to inflammatory cell death, which is detrimental to the host. We found that
neutralizing TNF-α and IFN-γ reduced SARS-CoV-2–induced mortality in mice. But little is known about the
mechanistic basis behind the uncontrolled cytokine release. While several potential therapies to block different
inflammatory cytokines are being explored, balancing proinflammatory responses to clear the virus with
preventing systemic inflammation remains challenging. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which
the innate immune system recognizes and responds to coronavirus infections will be key to informing and
developing therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the roles of specific innate immune sensors, inflammasome
activation, and inflammatory cell death in COVID-19 disease development remain unknown. We have
previously elucidated the molecular details of innate immune signaling pathways that regulate inflammation
and pathogenic clearance, identifying upstream sensors and important molecules in these pathways. In this
grant application, we seek to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of novel innate immune sensors and
inflammasome regulators discovered in our lab previously and understand their crosstalk with cell death
regulators in coronavirus infection. Basic science supporting this area of research is critical to understanding
the fundamentals of the innate immune response. The work completed under this proposal will characterize
the major innate immune sensors that are directly sensing SARS-CoV-2 to initiate interferon and inflammatory
cytokine expression and identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflammatory cell death in response
to SARS-CoV-2. These discoveries are expected to identify novel signaling pathways that could be targeted
by therapeutic interventions. The findings will be applicable to not only COVID-19, but also other infectious
diseases and conditions associated with a hyperactive innate immune response, cytokine release, and severe
inflammation; this work will be fundamental to inform clinical directions to prevent morbidity and mortality."
10844582,"Project Summary/Abstract
The etiology, mechanism and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and the relationship of AD pathology
to clinical manifestations, are not fully understood. Emerging studies suggest that inflammation and microglial
activation is an important contributor to AD pathogenesis and progression. The association between tau and
microglia is especially critical, since tau is most closely associated with AD. The conventionally accepted
sequence of this interaction is that misfolded tau, which is pro-inflammatory, causes microglial activation,
leading to dendritic pruning and eventually neuronal cell death. However, it is recently emerging that microglial
activation can itself cause tau aggregation and subsequent propagation. Therefore the causality of these
interactions is controversial, and requires much needed elucidation in humans in vivo. The goal of this proposal
is to understand the interaction and causal sequencing between tau, neurodegeneration, microglia and
systemic inflammation in governing the etiology and progression of human AD. This proposal involves a series
of principled statistical and mathematical model-based tests that will uncover these relationships, for the first
time, directly in patients. This proposal involves a new prospective longitudinal study of 100 AD spectrum
patients acquiring brain MRI and PET imaging of activated microglia using a new generation TSPO ligand
called DPA-713 and tau-PET imaging using a relatively novel ligand, MK6240. The same imaging protocol
(MRI, DPA-713 and MK6240 PET) will be repeated at 18- and 36-month follow up time points. All subjects will
have amyloid neuritic plaque density measured at baseline using florbetaben PET. Next this proposal involves
developing and testing a model of microglial inflammation-tau interaction via mathematical models to
determine whether regional microglia-mediated neuroinflammation measured by DPA-PET is higher in AD
spectrum patients or in cognitively normal older adults; and whether regional microglial activation is predictable
directly from tau and/or amyloid. Finally, this proposed research includes testing a network spread model of tau
and microglia. Mounting animal data implicate a trans-neuronal transmission mechanism of tau through brain
networks. Using a network diffusion model of disease spread, this proposal will further investigate the role of
microglia in tau progression directly in humans. Since tau and microglia provide complementary signal about
evolving pathology, this proposal will determine whether combining imaging studies that measure both
biomarkers will result in a uniquely powerful and predictive test of AD progression. Given the rapidly evolving
understanding of the role of microglia and systemic inflammation in dementias, the current proposal is timely,
topical and necessary for advancing human dementia research. If successful, it will give the first validated
spatiotemporal model of the causal interactions between pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, catalyzing
future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies."

Innate immunity provides the first line of host defense in response to invading pathogens. Pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viruses and other pathogens.
RIG-I/MDA-5 are DExD/H box RNA helicases in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway that detect double
stranded RNA viral genomes and activate the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS. The DNA sensor cGAS
detects double stranded DNA and activates STING, a transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum adaptor. Both
MAVS and STING activate canonical (IKKa and IKKb), and noncanonical IKK kinases (TBK1 and IKKi) to
activate transcription factors NF-kB and IRF3 respectively. Together, IRF3 and NF-kB regulate the expression
of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory genes that coordinate the innate response and initiate the adaptive
immune response against pathogens. The NLRP3 inflammasome also plays a critical role in inflammatory
responses by triggering caspase-1-mediated pro-IL-1b cleavage to yield the biologically active form of IL-
1b that drives inflammation and adaptive immunity. NLRP3 also induces a highly lytic form of inflammatory cell
death termed pyroptosis via cleavage of gasdermin-D to form plasma membrane pores. The RLR, cGAS-
STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are potent inducers of inflammation that must be tightly regulated
to avert overexuberant inflammation and tissue damage. TAX1BP1 was first identified as an anti-apoptotic
protein that interacts with the zinc finger deubiquitinase A20/TNFAIP3. Our previous work has established that
TAX1BP1 restricts cytokine-induced NF-kB activation as well as RLR-induced type I IFN production and
apoptosis. TAX1BP1 functions as a selective autophagy receptor by recruiting ubiquitinated cargo to
developing autophagosomes via two LC3 interaction regions (LIRs). However, it remains unclear how
TAX1BP1 autophagy function is regulated and if TAX1BP1 inhibits other innate immune signaling pathways. In
preliminary studies we provide experimental evidence that TAX1BP1 is phosphorylated by both noncanonical
and canonical IKK kinases which controls both basal and virus-induced TAX1BP1 autophagic degradation
respectively. Using TAX1BP1-deficient macrophages we have demonstrated that TAX1BP1 is a novel inhibitor
of both cGAS-STING and NLRP3 pathways. Furthermore, MAVS protein aggregates accumulate in TAX1BP1-
deficient cells suggesting a potential aggrephagy function in the regulation of innate immune signaling. The
central hypothesis driving the proposed investigations is that TAX1BP1 inhibits RLR, cGAS-STING and NLRP3
pathways by autophagy-mediated clearance of signaling protein aggregates. We will test this hypothesis
experimentally with the following Specific Aims: (1) determine the role of TAX1BP1 phosphorylation in its
autophagy function, (2) determine the mechanisms of TAX1BP1 inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway, and
(3) determine the mechanisms of TAX1BP1 inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway. Completion of the proposed
studies will provide new insights into innate immune regulation and immune homeostasis."
10817140,"Project summary: Scientists and clinicians have studied the underlying mechanisms of HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorder (HAND) for decades, spanning clinical trials and preclinical studies in animal models
and cellular systems. Although this research has undoubtedly pushed the field forward, there is still no
approved adjuvant therapy to relieve the cognitive impairment affecting a significant portion of ART-treated
patients. This could be partially due to the preclinical models themselves, which may incompletely model
human brain’s cellular heterogeneity, organization, and properties. We propose to bridge this gap by
developing a human brain slice culture model to study HIV neuropathogenesis. Human tissues are provided
from brain surgeries via a collaboration with a neurosurgeon colleague. These include adult normal human
brain tissues, cerebrospinal fluid, and peripheral blood. We will isolate monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM)
from a donor’s blood sample, infect them with a fluorescent HIV-1, and expose the infected MDMs to patient-
matched HIV-negative brain cultures. After the brain slice infection is established, HIV replication will be
controlled with relevant concentrations of standard-of-care ART. This human model may better recapitulate
pathological features of HAND thought to be present in treated patients, including infection of appropriate CNS
cell types, subtle brain inflammation, and impaired neurotransmission, and serve as a highly relevant model
system for future studies on neuroHIV and preclinical testing of neuroprotective strategies. Aim 1 will optimize
brain slice culture conditions and examine neuronal structure and function (and neuroinflammation) over the
life of the culture. Cell viability will be assessed in slice cultures with different culture media and slice thickness
by longitudinal vital staining approaches and flow cytometry. Neuronal activity will also be longitudinally
measured with multielectrode arrays or calcium imaging, and dendritic branching and spine changes will be
monitored at multiple timepoints using DiI staining and Neurolucida 360 software analysis. Glial function will
also be studied using calcium signaling and glutamate probes. Aim 2 will examine optimized slice cultures
infected with patient-matched HIV+ MDMs and treated with ART. Infection progress will be tracked by confocal
imaging of the fluorescent HIV, flow cytometry, and HIV p24 Alphalisa. The inflammatory environment of HIV-
infected/uninfected slices pre- and post-ART will be assessed using flow cytometry and Alphalisa for select
inflammatory mediators and trophic factors. Neuronal status in ART-treated HIV+ brain slices will be
determined with the same techniques listed in Aim 1. Completion of the project will lay the foundation for a
human tissue-based model system that largely maintains the composition and local connectivity of the adult
brain, reflects the virally suppressed pathology in today’s patients, and can help validate important studies from
animal models. The model could foster understanding of viral persistence in the CNS, neuropathogenesis and
neuroprotective mechanisms, mechanism of drug action or toxicity, and comorbidities studies."
10839794,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Targeting neuropeptide and peptide hormone signaling is a promising strategy to treat a wide range of human
diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer. A rigorous molecular-level
understanding of how specific peptide molecules signal in disease provides valuable information that can directly
inform the design of therapeutic compounds. However, there remain a large number of bioactive and disease-
relevant endogenous peptides whose signaling pathways are not understood. Because of the importance of
peptide-receptor interactions in normal physiology and disease, there is a critical need for new tools and
approaches to fully interrogate and modulate these signaling systems.
 The long-term goal of my research program is to rigorously identify and evaluate novel molecular signaling
pathways as therapeutic targets. To achieve this goal, my research program pursues a highly interdisciplinary
approach, with expertise in the design, synthesis, and implementation of novel chemical probes and
peptidomimetics, protein and peptide mass spectrometry, and analysis of peptide-receptor interactions on cells.
Over the next five years, we are motivated by three broad research questions. 1) What are the receptors for a
given disease-related bioactive peptide? Our goal is to develop and implement new and unbiased chemical
approaches to directly detect peptide-receptor interactions without the need to genetically or chemically modify
the receptor prior to interaction. We will implement these approaches to identify receptors for three specific
peptide hormones with roles in obesity and diabetes. 2) How does peptide abundance and post-translational
processing influence disease? Our goal is to identify neuropeptide and peptide hormone interactions that can
be targeted to benefit human health. We are developing and applying mass spectrometry-based methods to
uncover the full complement of neuropeptides and peptide hormones in understudied disease-relevant
physiologies, including characterization of all post-translational modifications and rigorous quantitation. We will
use our strengths in chemical probe and peptidomimetic design to evaluate these new targets after initial
identification. 3) Are there new “non-traditional” approaches to modulating cell-cell signaling waiting to
be uncovered? Our goal is to explore naturally occurring peptide-receptor systems that function outside of the
traditional agonist/antagonist paradigm. Information gained from this research area will be utilized to develop
new chemical probes to better understand signaling events, and to inform the design of novel therapeutic routes
that may provide advantages over traditional modulators.
 Overall, this research program will develop new tools and strategies to fully understand and modulate peptide
signaling pathways. This work will impact biomedical research by a) significantly advancing understanding of
neuropeptides and hormones in disease, b) identifying novel signaling pathways to target for treatment, and c)
generating chemical probes as the starting point for therapeutic agents."
10918301,"Antipsychotic medications are a cornerstone of care for FEP patients because they reduce the risk of relapse
and hospitalization. Therefore, strategies to enhance adherence to antipsychotics are an urgent need in
psychiatric practice. Ideally, antipsychotic medications would be studied in randomized trials. However,
progress in the management of FEP cannot rely exclusively on randomized trials, which cannot answer all
clinically relevant questions. Because randomized trials cannot realistically answer all questions about the
effectiveness of early FEP interventions in all clinical populations and for all outcomes in a timely way, the
findings from randomized trials need to be complemented with those from observational studies. Causal
inference from observational data can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical pragmatic
randomized trial—the target trial. We will use data from the FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration to emulate target trials
of initiation of oral and long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications. To overcome concerns about
confounding due to noncomparability of individuals in different treatment groups, we will conduct our
observational analyses in two steps. First, we will identify the observational data required to replicate findings
from two flagship randomized clinical trials in this area: the EUFEST and PRELAPSE trials. This benchmarking
of the observational effect estimates to existing randomized trial estimates allows to calibrate, and increase
confidence in, the observational analyses. Second, we will emulate target trials that extend the results from
previous trials for the management of individuals with FEP. Specifically, we will study the risks of
nonadherence, relapse, and hospitalization over longer follow-up periods in adolescents and adults under
different treatment strategies after FEP diagnosis. The findings from these analyses will help guide the choice
of antipsychotics to enhance adherence and clinical outcomes. This Project 2 also complements the findings
from the randomized trial in Project 1 using the FEP-CAUSAL Collaboration, an international consortium of
prospective cohorts of individuals with FEP that is coordinated by LEAP’s Methods Core. Our target trial
emulations will pioneer the implementation of causal inference methodology to observational prospective
cohorts in FEP. The superiority of this methodological approach has been demonstrated in several areas of
medicine but not yet in psychiatry. We expect that our work will result in methodological advances and in case
studies that will be generally applicable across many areas of mental health research."
10893028,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term mission of my lab is to decipher the critical pathways that sense nucleic acids as a danger,
and the post-transcriptional gene regulatory components that facilitate the subsequent cellular response -
with the goal that such knowledge significantly contributes to our scientific understanding of innate
immunity in human health and disease. Research on innate immunity has traditionally focused on
understanding the initiating triggers that ultimately modulate the transcriptional expression of a central set
of interferons and cytokines. Much less is known about the post-transcriptional gene regulatory
layer, which acts to refine innate immune activation at the RNA level – shaping gene expression to
allow for a robust but finite host response while simultaneously preventing aberrant or pathogen-
associated gene expression. This remains a striking gap in our understanding given that many aspects
of host-pathogen interactions have at its core the detection and suppression of foreign nucleic acids,
particularly from viruses. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can pre-program the sensitivity of cells to
immunogenic stimuli, as well as being essential factors in the anti-viral response. Towards these interests,
and in line with our outlined goals of the first cycle of our R35 funding period, we made substantial
progress in our investigations on: 1)The characterization of essential and immune-relevant RBPs
including ELAVL1 and the YTHDF protein family, 2) the discovery of widespread viral-host RBP
interactions through our development of VIR-CLASP and characterization of their impact on viral
replication, and 3) the identification and characterization of a novel small molecule catalytic inhibitor of the
cGAS-STING pathway, given that we also model dynamic post-transcriptional regulation by examining
how this primary cytosolic DNA sensor initiates a generalized innate immune response to perceived
foreign nucleic acids. Taken together, my laboratory has grown in expertise in RNA/DNA binding protein
biochemistry and -omic scale biology aimed directly at characterizing the essential roles of host RBPs and
components of the cGAS pathway in conferring innate immunity. For this research renewal, we aim to
expand our understanding within our established research program by pursuing the following
major biological questions:
1)How do non-canonical cellular RBPs regulate and maintain host gene expression, especially during viral
infection?
2)What are the unique host RBP-viral genome interactions that impact replication and virulence of related
 viruses within different intracellular environments during early infection?
3) What are the novel components that regulate and facilitate a non-canonical cGAS-dependent pathway
 promoting innate immune transcriptional activation and programmed DNA damage."
10843191,"ABSTRACT
Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 13 (SCA13) is caused by mutations in KCNC3, the gene that encodes Kv3.1
voltage-dependent potassium channels. This condition results in motor abnormalities and the inability to locate
sounds in space. Kv3.3 is highly expressed in the cerebellum and in auditory brainstem nuclei, including the
calyx of Held presynaptic terminals in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Kv3.3 differs from
other closely-related channels in having an extended C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that recruits several
cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1). This enzyme keeps Kv3.3 bound to
Hax-1, a cell survival protein that, when bound to the channel, triggers the formation of a dense actin
cytoskeleton under the plasma membrane. This process is impaired in a Kv3.3 mutant (G592R Kv3.3) that
causes late-onset SCA13. This mutation overstimulates TBK1 activity but prevents the channel from triggering
actin nucleation. The experiments in this proposal will test the hypothesis that TBK1 is required for normal
synaptic transmission and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles because it is a physiological regulator of the
interactions between the Kv3.3 and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Patch clamp studies will be combined
with imaging and EM immunomicroscopy to test the effects of TBK1 inhibition or manipulation of TBK1 activity
with genetic approaches in cell lines and in the calyx of Held terminals from wild type, Kv3.3-/- and G592R
Kv3.3 animals . Phospho-specific antibodies will be used to determine if TBK1 activity is altered by stimulation
of auditory neurons in brain slice preparations and by acoustic stimulation of intact animals in vivo. Finally, the
specific domains required to couple TBK1 to the Kv3.3/Hax-1 complex will be defined by mutagenesis studies
and by proteomic approaches that identify phosphorylation sites for TBK1 in the channel complex. Our findings
will provide novel insights into the regulation of synaptic transmission in normal and pathological conditions
and will generate new targets for the treatment of diseases such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 13 and other
conditions that affect central auditory processing."

The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) has a sustained record of accomplishment in
preparing early career Scholars through its workforce development program. Since 2008, our program has
prepared 72 KL2 Scholars from our state's three major research universities with most retained in academic
positions (90%) and obtaining external funding as principal investigators (81%) including 36 R01s, 36 other R-
level awards, and 26 K or equivalent career awards. The state-wide reach of our program ensures a broad,
diverse pool of Scholars, faculty mentors, and breadth of translational research.
The primary objective of this new K12 Mentored Research Career Development Program at the Indiana
CTSI is to provide a diverse group of early career faculty Scholars intensive mentored career development
experiences that lead to research independence and prepare them for leadership positions in clinical and
translational science. To maximize K12 programmatic impact we have designed our proposed program to
address six core areas of clinical and translational science including core knowledge, team-based science,
leadership/management, mentoring training, diversity, and career visibility/enhancement. Protected time for
intensive mentored research activity is carefully balanced with required curricular content and a broad range of
elective experiences that capitalize on available Indiana CTSI resources and ultimately are selected based on
individual Scholar needs. Taken together these components assure training in a fundamental skillset for early
career clinical and translational research scientists. Given the historically low rates of underrepresented
individuals moving into scientific careers, we propose intentional evidence-based efforts to continue to recruit,
support, and fund these individuals. Our goal is to not only sustain our current diversity metrics, which exceed
those of our academic institutions, but to resemble the diversity of our state's population more closely. We
propose the following aims to achieve K12 program goals:
 1) Support and accelerate Scholar transition to independent careers in clinical and translational research.
 2) Catalyze Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts throughout the KL2 program to advance the
 diversity of Scholars, their teams, and their translational work.
 3) Leverage institutional strengths and companion CTSA hub partnerships to optimize Scholar
 development including career visibility and enhancement.
We anticipate funding 25 Scholars over 5 years with each Scholar spending two years on the K12, with the
goal to obtain a federally funded K or R level grant. We have a successful history of securing institutional funds
to support additional Scholars (increasing the positions offered by as much as 50%). We are confident that our
proposed program will attract diverse, high caliber applicants and mentor them toward developing impactful
careers in clinical and translational science."
10912436,"Project Summary:
The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) is a cell cycle control that ensures accurate
chromosome segregation during cell division. It is activated by unattached kinetochores, which
recruit many different signaling proteins to produce an inhibitory signal that delays anaphase
onset and averts chromosome missegregation. Aberrant SAC signaling has long been suspected
to promote genome instability in cancerous cells, but the nature of the aberrations and their
consequences remain unclear. We propose that the perturbation of SAC signaling dynamics can
elevate chromosome missegregation. However, the SAC has been mainly studied under quasi
stead-state conditions despite being a dynamical process. Therefore, we will tackle questions
central to SAC signaling dynamics using a systems biological approach that integrates
quantitative data and mathematical modeling. Our goal is to answer the following fundamental
questions using a combination of experiments and theoretical modeling: What is the rate at which
a single unattached kinetochore generates the ‘wait-anaphase’ signal? Does it change over the
course of cell division? Is it sufficiently high to delay anaphase onset indefinitely? What are the
main determinants of this rate? Answers to these questions will reveal a dynamical picture of SAC
signaling and allow us to define the causes and consequences of aberrant SAC signaling in
cancer cells."

The Cellular Molecular and Biochemical Sciences Program (CMBP) at Ohio State University (OSU) draws faculty
and trainees from four related molecular life sciences graduate programs: Microbiology, Molecular Cellular and
Developmental Biology, Molecular Genetics, and the Ohio State Biochemistry Program. The goal of the CMBP is to
create opportunities for student training not available through other programs on campus by providing: (1) a broader
range of rotation choices, (2) interdisciplinary monthly meeting seminars and symposia, (3) coursework that
includes an emphasis on the responsible conduct of research, scientific writing, rigor and reproducibility, and
training in quantitative skills, (4) career-advancing components including professional development workshops
specifically developed for this program, internship opportunities, and Individual Development Plans, and (5) faculty
mentor training to ensure a holistic and supportive advisory environment conducive to trainee growth and
development. CMBP is a rigorous program designed to attract top students to OSU, and the breadth and depth of
the training provided will position CMBP graduates to make significant contributions to biomedical research in
academia, government, and industry. In the past few years, sustained and significant institutional support has
facilitated interdisciplinary research and graduate training at OSU. The unique combination of opportunities offered
through the CMBP has already increased recruitment and retention of the very best graduate students, in particular
from underrepresented minorities (URM) and students with disabilities. Strong matching institutional support has
allowed us to exceed our goal of having one quarter of fellowships awarded to URM/disability/disadvantaged
students, with 40% of the trainees supported over the last 10 years being in one of these categories. The resources
requested in this proposal would allow us to build on initiatives developed over the last 10 years and continue to
further develop a graduate training experience that spans a broad range of topics and activities in the cellular,

10773110,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) consistently rank among the top ten chronic conditions in the United
States in terms of prevalence and mortality. US veterans develop diabetes and CKD at an alarming rate, and
comorbidity is twice as common in veterans compared with the general population. Both diseases put patients
at increased risk of fracture and when fractures occur, patients are at a greater risk of death compared to other
populations. Treatments for skeletal disease typically address deficits in either bone mass or tissue quality, which
may be insufficient in cases of combined CKD and diabetes where there are known deficits in both. Despite their
increasing comorbidity and well-established detrimental impacts on the skeleton, their skeletal interaction
remains unexplored due to a lack of combined disease animal models and routine exclusion of patients with
diabetes and/or CKD from clinical drug trials. The goal of this project is to study skeletal interactions between
diabetes and CKD and to identify effective combination skeletal treatments. Using our novel combined model of
diabetes and CKD, we will test the central hypothesis that increasing bone mass while concurrently improving
tissue quality using combined therapies will increase bone mechanical strength, improve fracture resistance, and
reverse adverse skeletal effects of late-stage diabetes+CKD. To achieve this goal, we will use our novel
combined model of diabetes and CKD to investigate molecular, biochemical, and compositional changes coupled
with multiscale structural and mechanical properties. Aim 1 will investigate the effects of combined disease as a
function of age of onset and disease duration. Our lab has established a combined model of diabetes
(streptozotocin) and CKD (adenine) that uniquely alters skeletal properties in young mice. 4 experiments will be
used, inducing disease in either young or aged mice, and then allowing disease to progress for a short or longer
duration. Key outcomes will include longitudinal insulin and glucose monitoring, HbA1c, insulin and glucose
tolerance tests, pancreatic beta cell mass, and renal biochemistries. Skeletal outcomes will include biochemical
markers of turnover and disease, structural imaging, bone formation/resorption histology, and a suite of
multiscale mechanical and compositional properties. These experiments will clarify how diabetes and CKD
impact the skeleton as a function of sex, age, and disease duration. In Aim 2, we will determine the skeletal
impacts of treatment in late-stage disease utilizing mechanical loading (to improve bone mass) and Raloxifene
(RAL – to improve tissue hydration and quality). We have shown that RAL, an FDA-approved agent for treating
bone, specifically benefits bone material properties in a cell- and estrogen-independent manner. End points will
be the same as those in Aim 1, including colocalized Raman spectroscopy and nanoindentation to characterize
the mineral and collagen properties/mechanics of bone formed during the interventions compared with older
bone. To increase translational value in Aim 3, we will determine the effects of pharmaceutical polytherapies
initiated in late-stage combined diabetes and CKD. This work will challenge the idea that the effect of combined
disease on the skeleton is equal to the sum of the parts and will have a positive impact in our at risk-veteran
population by providing new ways to prevent or treat skeletal deficits associated with diabetes and CKD."
10781953,"Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) including cirrhosis of any etiology are the major risk factors for the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The national prevalence and mortality due to HCC in the US VA healthcare
systems have increased by 3-fold during the last decade. Despite HBV vaccination, improved screening methods,
and successful antiviral treatment for HCV, the incidence of CLD and cirrhosis has substantially (13%) increased
since 2000. The existing treatment options (radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy) of unresectable and
metastatic HCC have not been successful in the majority of cases. Thus, HCC remains a significant healthcare
challenge. The fundamental goal of this proposal is to determine mechanisms driving the transformation process
and tumor growth in the liver, and develop strategies to improve clinical outcomes for these patients. In this quest,
we found that doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) protein is highly expressed in chronic viral hepatitis, cirrhosis,
and HCC but not in normal liver. Elevated DCLK1 is associated with decreased survival of HCC patients. Recently,
we demonstrated that DCLK1 activates an atypical β-catenin(48 kDa)/TCF4 signaling in hepatoma cells. However,
its significance in the CLDs and HCC and DCLK1/β-catenin signaling axis in hepatic cell stemness is completely
unknown. Using a mouse model of HCC, we demonstrated that DCLK1 is heavily induced in hepatocytes at sites
of injury and likely contributes to the HCC-like tumor growth. Our preliminary data revealed that DCLK1-expressing
hepatoma cells can polarize Kupffer cells (KCs) into immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages. IL-10 secreted by
M2-like KCs has been reported to promote the selective apoptosis of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages. Thus,
DCLK1-dependent M2 polarization has the potential to promote immunosuppression in the hepatic tumor
microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, inhibition of DCLK1 kinase activity resulted in a dramatic reduction in key
pro-inflammatory (TNFα, IL-1β) and immunosuppressive IL-10. These observations suggested that DCLK1 is a
central regulator of the complex interconnection of fibrogenic, immunoregulatory, and tumorigenic processes in
CLDs. Our central hypothesis is that DCLK1 is a key mediator of oncogenic signaling and immune dysregulation in
the tissue microenvironment in CLDs, which collectively stimulates the transformation of hepatocytes. We will test
this hypothesis with the following interrelated yet independent specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms
by which DCLK1 mediates immunoregulatory and tumorigenic processes in the liver by introducing deletion and
point mutation in DCLK1 and assay for the functional impacts. We will use inhibitors to DCLK1 kinase (DCLK1-IN-
1) and β-catenin/TCF interaction (FH535) to verify DCLK1-regulated clonogenicity, CSC properties, and
monocyte/KCs polarization. Aim 2 will determine the effects of DCLK1 kinase inhibition on the DCLK1/β-catenin
regulated signaling axis, hepatic transformation process, and immune dysregulation in the HCC TME in a murine
model of cirrhosis/liver cancer. Finally, Aim 3 will define the role of the DCLK1/β-catenin axis in the regulation of
liver cancer cell stemness and tumor cell heterogeneity in a patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) model. The
results will be confirmed by the treatment of PDX tumors with DCLK1-IN-1, FH535, and in combination. In addition,
we will perform scRNAseq and phosphoproteomic analysis of the tumors to determine differential phosphorylation
in DCLK1+ tumor cells and DCLK1 signaling network mediated by phosphorylation. These studies will deepen our
understanding of DCLK1 regulation of a complex signaling axis contributing to hepatic tumorigenicity and
suppression of innate immune response in the liver tissues, which together drive HCC initiation and tumor growth.
In addition, the project will deliver potential anti-DCLK1-based approaches for the prevention and treatment of
HCC and cancers of other organs that rely upon DCLK1 functions."
10813740,"Project Summary/Abstract
BST-2, also known as tetherin, inhibits HIV-1 release from the plasma membrane of infected cells. HIV-1 Vpu
neutralizes this restriction through not-mutually exclusive mechanisms, including degradation/downregulation,
sequestration, and displacement. However, the relative importance of each of these anti-tetherin mechanisms
in virus replication and transmission remains to be defined. Our long-term goal is to understand the roles of
Vpu and tetherin in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Specifically, we aim to understand the mechanisms of how host cell
proteins are involved in the Vpu-tetherin interaction. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that a
specific host cell protein, filamin A (FLNa) can modulate the antiviral activity of tetherin, and the particle
release-promoting activity of Vpu. These discoveries suggest that, an FLNa-dependent trafficking pathway of
tetherin is the essential step for Vpu to overcome the restriction imposed by tetherin. In this proposal, we will
further understand the details of how FLNa regulates the association of Vpu to tetherin. In Aim 1, we will
determine the mechanism by which FLNa regulates the antiviral activity of tetherin. Using live cell imaging and
flow cytometry, we will examine the effects of FLNa on trafficking dynamics of cell-surface tetherin and
intracellular tetherin. By examining the role of FLNa in the antiviral activity of tetherin against different HIV-1
subtypes, we will define the action spectrum of FLNa. By performing rescue experiments coupled with site-
directed mutagenesis, we will test the specificity of different FLNa domains in the antiviral activity of tetherin. In
Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which FLNa modulates the activity of Vpu to relieve tetherin
restriction. We will examine the role of FLNa in the anti-tetherin activity of Vpu derived from different genetic
subtypes. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST), we will quantify
the FLNa-Vpu interaction. Using quantitative IP assays and quantitative confocal microscopy, we will examine
potential roles of FLNa in the Vpu-tetherin interaction and in the Vpu-tetherin colocalization. Finally, we will
evaluate the importance of FLNa in each of three different mechanisms involved in Vpu-mediated tetherin
antagonism. In Aim 3, we will focus on human primary macrophages to define the potential role of FLNa in the
association of Vpu to tetherin. We will determine the effects of FLNa in HIV-1 infected macrophages on virus
release and virus transmission from macrophages to CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these studies will provide
important insights into the Vpu-tetherin interaction in HIV-1 replication, transmission, and pathogenesis."
10817678,"Project Summary
Healthy and diseased physiological states are governed by a complex web of interacting proteins that confer the
collective behavior observed in cells. These protein networks are decorated with posttranslational modifications
(PTMs) that determine their structure, function, and impart specificity for cellular signaling. Phosphorylation and
acetylation represent two common PTMs that dictate healthy and disease states in human cells. For instance,
14-3-3 proteins scaffold thousands of important phosphoproteins with evidence suggesting that acetylation can
modify its function. Current progress toward the elucidation of PTM-mediated signaling networks is hampered
by the challenge of studying transient PTMs in cells and limited methods to produce proteins containing specific
combinations of modified amino acids. Our previous efforts utilized a recoded E. coli strain (i.e., genomically
recoded organism) to synthesize all human phosphoserine proteins using a genetic code expansion technique.
We expanded this work through the development of a two hybrid like technology, named HI-P. HI-P validated
previously observed phosphorylation dependent protein-protein interactions and identified scores of novel
phosphoserine-mediated interactions across the human proteome that have been validated in biochemical- and
cell-based assays. Our approach allows for synthetic DNA inputs to direct ribosome-based phosphoprotein
synthesis and thus creates a programmable genetic tool to study the human phosphoproteome at the molecular
level. Since deciphering complex protein networks require studying the impact of multiple PTMs in isolation and
in combination, the key contribution of the proposed research is expected to expand the ability to genetically
encode phosphoserine and acetylation at precise positions in 14-3-3 proteins to reveal PTM-mediated protein-
protein interactions. Specific Aims: In this proposal, we seek to leverage a strong foundation of technologies,
expertise, and preliminary data to construct a recoded E. coli with a single stop codon (two open codons) (Aim
1), develop a protein synthesis system capable of simultaneous encoding of phosphorylated and acetylated
amino acids into proteins (Aim 2), and employ these capabilities to deconvolute PTM-mediated 14-3-3 protein
network interactions (Aim 3). Significance: This work will be significant because it will enable the expression of
programmable human proteins containing two PTMs thereby establishing a new approach to decipher complex
human signaling networks at the molecular level. We anticipate this work will elucidate novel 14-3-3 protein
network interactions governed by PTMs and enable new research into biomolecular and protein mechanisms
that can be used to develop new therapies for human disease."
10817873,"Adults >75 years are the fastest growing segment of the US population and are increasingly receiving medical
interventions from which they often have little chance to benefit, such as cancer screening. Few of the
randomized trials of cancer screening tests included adults >75 years and thus the benefits of screening are
uncertain; yet, there are important harms which include anxiety, complications as a result of false positive tests
and/or work-up of cancer, and overdiagnosis (detection of non-lethal tumors) leading to overtreatment.
Guidelines recommend that cancer screening decisions for adults >75 years be individualized based on their
risk for cancer, 10-year life expectancy, and values and preferences. Yet, many older adults are screened for
cancer with little knowledge of the harms, including many with <10 year life expectancy who are very unlikely
to benefit. Since engaging patients in shared decision making (SDM) improves care, patient satisfaction, and
outcomes, my research program aims to improve SDM around cancer screening between older adults and
their clinicians through: 1) improving estimation of older adults' long-term prognosis; 2) developing prediction
models for late-life cancer; and 3) creating decision aids to help older adults make more informed, preference-
sensitive, screening decisions. With a K24 and the supportive environment and resources at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, I aim to continue to build my patient oriented
research program in SDM around cancer screening for older adults, to expand my mentorship program to
prepare the next generation of aging researchers in SDM, and to expand my own research skills and mentor-
ship program by developing new expertise in implementation science. My Specific Aims are: 1)To continue to
conduct high quality research that will lead to improved SDM around cancer screening for older adults, with an
emerging focus on implementation science. This will be accomplished through my newly funded 5-year NIA
R01 project that aims to develop and test a quick and easy-to-use web-based conversation aid to support SDM
between PCPs, women >75 years, and their involved family members during a visit and through my ongoing
research projects. 2) To use my research as a platform to mentor new investigators in research on improving
SDM around medical interventions for older adults, especially for cancer screening, and to help them become
independent investigators. This aim will be accomplished by: i. direct involvement of trainees in my research
projects, ii. completion of ancillary studies related to my new R01, iii. leveraging my research program's
infrastructure to enable my mentees' investigations, and iv. ongoing recruitment and retention of high caliber
mentees. Impact: As more medical interventions, like cancer screening, with uncertain benefit but important
harms for older adults become available, there is great need for high quality decision tools to support SDM
between PCPs and older adults. With mentees I will develop and test novel decision tools to support SDM. A
focus on implementation science will ensure these tools are widely implemented thus improving patient care."
10951138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Insomnia is a prevalent health problem associated with adverse cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health
outcomes. Previously proposed subtypes, based on traditional clinical measures, have poor reliability and validity
and have not proven useful for guiding insomnia treatment decisions. Based on a large base of preliminary data
from various domains and several investigative groups, we have identified a particular phenotype, insomnia with
short sleep duration (ISS), that is associated with increased risk for adverse health outcomes, greater
physiological hyperarousal as indicated by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, and worse
response to Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (CBT-I). The proposed study represents the next
logical extension of our previous observations: To determine the efficacy of CBT-I in individuals with
ISS vs. Insomnia with normal sleep duration (INS) among adults with elevated blood pressure (BP), and
to examine the efficacy of trazodone among non-remitters to CBT-I. CBT-I is recommended as first-line
treatment for insomnia, and trazodone is a widely-prescribed but grossly understudied medication for insomnia.
In addition, our pilot data demonstrate differential efficacy of CBT-I and trazodone in ISS and INS: trazodone,
but not CBT-I, increases objective total sleep time (TST), and lowers BP and evening cortisol in ISS. We will
conduct a 4-site cohort study followed by a placebo-controlled RCT in 600 adults (≥18y) with insomnia. The
cohort study will examine the efficacy of CBT-l among individuals with ISS vs. INS phenotypes (n=300 each),
defined by polysomnographic (PSG) TST. The subsequent RCT will compare the efficacy of trazodone vs.
placebo among CBT-I non-remitters. Investigators at the 4 study sites (Hershey, Denver, Pittsburg, and Quebec)
have a long history of collaboration and successful completion of NIH-funded mechanistic and clinical trial
studies. Our primary outcome will be the insomnia remission at 8 weeks, defined as Insomnia Severity Index
(ISI) <8; ISI is the gold-standard self-report measure of insomnia symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include
ISI (continuous), objective (i.e., PSG and actigraphy) measures of sleep efficiency (in the CBT-I cohort study)
and TST, HBP, and evening cortisol (in the trazodone-placebo RCT). In exploratory analyses, we will test
whether changes in evening cortisol mediate the effect of trazodone on objective TST and HBP. Outcomes will
be assessed at 8 weeks and 6 months following the end of treatment to evaluate the durability of treatment
effects. Demonstrating a differential efficacy of CBT-I as a function of insomnia phenotype would aid the goals
of precision medicine, which directs therapy on the basis of clinical phenotypes and physiology as well as
genetics. Although CBT-I is recommended as first-line treatment for all adults with insomnia, finding a worse
response in the ISS phenotype will lead to reconsidering this current guideline in lieu of matching patients’
phenotype to treatment. Demonstrating the efficacy of trazodone among CBT-I non-remitters will fill an obvious
and important knowledge gap in insomnia treatment l as it pertains to its current wide-spread off-label use."
10849779,"Project Summary
Over the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, coincident with the obesity epidemic. Obesity and adipose
tissue inflammation are linked to whole-body metabolic disturbances as other organs cope with toxic levels of
lipid, which would otherwise be safely stored in adipocytes. Of additional importance, adipose tissue is an active
endocrine organ that secretes numerous adipokines including hormones and cytokines, regulating systemic
glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and many other physiological processes. Many clinical
and animal studies show a strong link between expansion of intra-abdominal fat, or visceral fat, and
increased burden of IBD. The mesenteric visceral adipose tissue depot (MAT) surrounds and supports the
gastrointestinal tract, dramatically expands during obesity, and is associated with unfavorable therapeutic
outcomes for IBD. However, studying mesenteric adipose tissue is challenging as it is a highly lymphatic and
cellularly heterogenous tissue. In this proposal I have applied methods that will isolate mature adipocytes,
adipocyte progenitors, and immune cells so that I can study the unique way MAT remodels during
obesity and how MAT inflammation affects the progression of IBD.
 The literature and our preliminary data suggest that during obesity MAT expansion and remodeling is
different than other visceral adipose depots. Therefore, I hypothesize that during obesity, MAT undergoes
maladaptive remodeling, initiating inflammatory cascades that exacerbates IBD in mice. The first Aim will
define pathological MAT expansion during obesity using adipocyte and adipocyte progenitor lineage-tracing
mouse models, in-depth characterization of the immune system, and single-cell RNA-sequencing methods. The
second Aim will determine the importance of MAT inflammation to IBD progression. The gastrointestinal tract
has understandably been the primary focus of study for several well-established mouse models that closely
resemble human Crohn's disease. My general approach will be to focus on MAT biology and the role of
mesenteric adipocyte inflammation at the intestinal interface. To study MAT/intestinal crosstalk during IBD, I will
use mouse models to alter inflammation in MAT in an inducible manner and observe the effect on the severity
of intestinal damage and inflammation.
 Currently, there is an unmet need for the treatment of IBD and no MAT-targeted treatments for IBD exist.
Therefore, an understanding of mesenteric adipose tissue during obesity and its communication to the
intestine may open up a fruitful area of research for new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for IBD."

How phages and viruses recognize their specific host cell receptors is not known for the vast majority of
species. The long-term goal is to understand the general principles behind the structures and mechanisms that
control host cell entry for bacteriophages. The objective of this proposal is to determine the structures, and
mechanisms of how phages use both outer and inner membrane proteins for infection in enteric pathogens
such as Shigella, E.coli and Salmonella. The central hypothesis is that there are conserved protein structures
and corresponding mechanisms that govern phage entry for the majority of phage:host pairs. We predict that
there are universal cell surface features that are generally required for phage entry, and also other cell surface
features that may be specific to individual phage:host pairs. The rationale underlying the proposed work is that
we will identify key receptor proteins in enteric pathogens that mediate phage infection, and that a better
understanding of these interactions will provide physical targets for either identifying new therapies or
improving existing ones. We will pursue this research using a combination of conceptual and technological
innovations involving genetics, biochemistry and biophysics. These include innovations recently developed in
my laboratory, as well as more established microbiological techniques. The proposed research is significant,
as it will provide both structural and mechanistic insights into how phages dock to their specific hosts, a
necessary step for productive infection. This work will also develop resources that will be used by other
researchers. For example, the proposed work will develop widely-applicable complex transposon and single
gene deletion libraries, which will greatly propel research forward in Shigella, as currently no such genetic
toolkit exists. The expected outcome of this work will provide a basic understanding of how phages attach to
hosts including which proteins and interactions are universally required, and which are specific to individual
phage:host pairs. Additionally, we will gain an atomic level understanding of the protein:protein binding
interactions and transient infection intermediate states that control infection. Atomic level details, such as how
phages bind to their hosts are critical for engineering new therapeutics or enhancing existing ones."
10846745,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Haploid gametes (i.e. eggs and sperm) are generated from diploid precursors through the cell division of
meiosis. Eggs and sperm are highly specialized cells that differ in both their morphologies and in their
contributions to fertilization and embryogenesis. To achieve these differences, eggs and sperm are generated
from meiotic programs with sex-specific characteristics. However, surprisingly little is known about the
molecular mechanisms that define sex-specificity. Previously, we identified a novel allele of C. elegans
topoisomerase II that uniquely disrupts the segregation of homologous chromosomes during the meiotic
divisions of spermatogenesis but not oogenesis. Topoisomerase II (Topo II) is an enzyme that plays a crucial
role in chromosome fidelity by disentangling topological problems that arise in double stranded DNA. Topo II is
a large ATP-dependent, homodimeric enzyme. Each subunit breaks one DNA strand, passes a second
unbroken strand through the break, and then reseals the break. Thus, Topo II enzymes solve topological
problems that arise during replication, transcription, chromosome segregation, and recombination. The
identification of a sex-specific role for this key, ubiquitous enzyme highlights the differential regulation of the
two meiotic programs. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecules and systems that ensure that each
egg and sperm receive the correct number of chromosomes during meiosis. To understand this fundamental
process, we will utilize the metazoan animal model C. elegans, which, in addition to sexually dimorphic meiotic
programs, provides many experimental advantages such as a fast generation time, a transparent body for in
vivo analysis of meiosis, and a single top-2 gene. The research in this proposal encompasses two main
programs related to sex-specific regulation of meiotic chromosome structure and segregation. Program 1 will
identify sex-specific differences in chromosomal axes components, synaptonemal complex (SC) disassembly,
and chromosome compaction prior to the segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic
division. Using a targeted candidate gene approach and mutational analysis, including our previously identified
sex-specific top-2 allele, we will identify genes that differentially regulate SC disassembly and chromosome
compaction in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Then, in Program 2, we delve into the mechanisms that
regulate TOP-2 localization and activity in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This work builds on our findings
that mutations within tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDPT-1) can suppress the top-2 mutant phenotypes.
Using a combination of biochemical and genetic techniques we will identify the mechanism of suppression of
top-2(it7) embryonic lethality for the tdpt-1 mutant suppressors and identify novel TOP-2 interacting proteins
during mitosis vs. meiosis and in spermatogenesis vs. oogenesis."
10848175,"Project Summary - SEED Follow-up
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts approximately 1.5% of
children in the United States. Individuals with ASD experience deficits in social communication or restricted
interests and repetitive behavior; but the severity and patterns vary greatly and convey lifelong impairment for
some. It is unclear how the presentation of ASD changes from early childhood into adolescence or adulthood.
The causes of ASD are also unknown, though substantial evidence supports the contribution of both genes
and environmental factors. These gaps in knowledge exist because US studies to date have lacked the
sample size, depth of data collection, or appropriate life course timing to address these questions. The Study
to Explore Early Development (SEED) is now able to address these prior limitations. SEED is a large case-
control study of children ages 2-5 years and their families, implemented across eight states over three phases.
SEED collected detailed data on children’s core ASD symptoms, cognitive status, and presence of co-
occurring conditions in early childhood, along with extensive risk factors related to maternal health and the
perinatal environment as well as genomics. The SEED sample includes 2044 children with ASD, 1950 children
with non-ASD developmental disabilities (DD), and 2285 population control children (POP), making this the
largest etiologic study of ASD in the US. Recent ancillary studies - the SEED Teen Pilot and SEED COVID
studies -- will soon add data on adolescent health and the consequences of the pandemic, respectively, for
some SEED participants. The work proposed here, SEED Follow-up Studies (SEED FU), will maximize the
impact of extant SEED data through analyses that characterize ASD phenotypes and assess the potential
interplay between genetic and modifiable risk factors. SEED FU will also facilitate new data collection in
middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood to characterize changes in ASD phenotype across
developmental stages, and the associated health, educational, and service needs across the early life course.
These data will further enable prospective analyses of associations between early life factors and later
childhood through early adulthood outcomes. Studying risk factors in relation to life course phenotypic
subgroups may also help elucidate etiologies previously masked in ASD case-control studies. The NC SEED
Team in combination with the SEED Network’s collaborative infrastructure and extensive extant data
resources, will ensure the successful implementation of the SEED FU Study in North Carolina and contribute to
success across the network. SEED is well-powered for making significant contributions to our understanding
of the complex autism phenotype and identifying factors associated with ASD risk in the population. The
knowledge gained by SEED FU will greatly advance our ability prevent adverse developmental outcomes and
to support individuals with ASD and their families to ensure optimal wellbeing through early adulthood."

10838546,"CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION: ABSTRACT
The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) is Oklahoma’s only NCI-designated cancer center and plays a critical
mission-driven role in training the next generation of cancer biomedical researchers and oncology health
professionals for the state (the SCC catchment area) and for the nation. To advance this goal, the SCC’s
Education, Training and Career Enhancement (ETCE) Core, led by Rajagopal Ramesh, PhD, SCC Associate
Director for Education and Training, provides important oversight, coordination and support for a wide range of
educational and mentorship activities for students and trainees in all career stages (high school,
undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral fellows, clinical fellows, and junior investigators) conducting cancer-
related projects. The SCC has made significant investments in ETCE infrastructure and resources and has
leveraged OUHSC institutional resources to promote and advance training and career development. During the
reporting period (2017-21), ETCE has made significant progress in advancing its goal and aims, as is
highlighted through increases to training funding. Total peer-reviewed training funding increased by 109%,
from $983K to $2.05M, since last CCSG (annual, direct cost). This includes seven new NIH K awards, two new
NIH F awards, and two new P20 Centers for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBREs). A third new $7.5M
(total, DC) COBRE grant to mentor junior SCC cancer imaging researchers started 2/15/22 (new funding not
included in totals). Total all training funding increased by 115%, from $1.07M to $2.29M. The overall number of
all training projects increased from 11 (2016) to 33 (2021). With ETCE support, the SCC obtained an American
Cancer Society-Institutional Research Grant (ACS-IRG), the only such grant awarded nationally by ACS in
2019, to support young investigator research (the IRG includes an ACS supplement to support one investigator
from an underrepresented minority [URM] group). In addition, the SCC received funding for an ACS Diversity in
Cancer Research (ACS-DICR) summer student program to support eight URM undergraduate students. The
ETCE Core administers summer research programs for high school (CURE, Jr.) and undergraduate (CURE)
students, and it has partnered with multiple institutional entities at OUHSC to bring a cancer research focus to
various other summer internship (e.g., CRISP, INBRE, NARCH, SURE) as well as mentoring (INBRE, COBRE,
OSCTR) programs. As is highlighted in the Research Strategy, ETCE works closely with SCC research
leadership, including the Associate Directors for Community Outreach and Engagement and Diversity, Equity
and Inclusion, to enhance the participation of women and persons from historically underrepresented groups in
education pipeline and career development programs (ETCE Specific Aim 3)."
10838548,"PLANS FOR ENHANCING DIVERSITY: ABSTRACT
Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity
and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. A diverse scientific workforce fosters
scientific innovation, enhances global competitiveness, contributes to robust learning environments, improves
the quality of the research, and advances the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations
participate in, and benefit from health research, while enhancing the public trust. A commitment to these core
assumptions underlies the Stephenson Cancer Center’s (SCC) focus on enhancing workforce diversity, equity,
and inclusion (DEI). The SCC’s priority commitment to enhancing DEI helps the center capitalize on innovative
ideas and unique and diverse perspectives. To this end, SCC leadership has taken several steps to elevate the
promotion of DEI as a strategic priority for the SCC. This begins with formally incorporating DEI into the SCC’s
evolving strategic plan, which was done in 2020 with the inclusion of a new core strategic priority (#7
Enhancing the presence of women, minorities and others from groups historically underrepresented in
research). To provide senior-level planning, the SCC director established a new Associate Director position for
DEI and appointed Joan Walker, MD (CPC) as the inaugural AD for this important role. Dr. Walker
subsequently appointed Adam Alexander, PhD (CPC), an early-stage Black/African American investigator
who focuses on health equity in the Black/AA community, as Assistant Director for DEI. Efforts are currently
underway to develop a formal core resource to assist the center, programs, and members with activities
related to DEI / PED specific aims. A comprehensive PED will be developed in 2022 in coordination with the
SCC’s overall strategic planning process.
Over the past five years (2017-21), the SCC has implemented multiple initiatives to enhance the presence of
women, minority and other groups historically underrepresented in research in the cancer center workforce
(including SCC membership, leadership, and staffing) as well as in education pipeline programs. The success
of this strategic focus can be seen in recruitment. Of the 31 new faculty externally recruited during the reporting
period, 16 (52%) are women, five (16%) are underrepresented minority (URM) persons, and 19 (61%) are
either women or URM individuals. Intentional engagement with and mentoring of URM members has resulted
in several peer-reviewed and other career enhancement grants."
10838551,"CANCER BIOLOGY PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Cancer Biology (CB) program at the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) is to foster
research in basic mechanisms that define normal and neoplastic cell growth to gain new insights into cancer
prevention, diagnosis and treatment. CB is a new program in this CCSG application, representing an evolution
of the previous Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR) program driven by a strategic reorganization
of programmatic research at the SCC. Research is organized around three integrated aims that focus on 1)
cancer cell signaling pathways, 2) tumor microenvironment and 3) mechanisms of chemoresistance. Specific
attention is placed on conducting basic mechanisms research related to Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE)-identified priority cancers that affect Oklahoma (the SCC catchment area). Program
members bring a diverse range of transdisciplinary expertise in basic cancer mechanisms, including: the
functions of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes; regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis; regulators of
angiogenesis and metastasis; and aberrant signaling that leads to chemoresistance. The CB program seeks to
channel these transdisciplinary interests in a collaborative, team-based approach. Focused interactions for
members have helped foster collaboration and advance CB research. During the reporting period, the CB
program conducted 135 interactive activities, including meetings, seminars, and training events. The CB
program is led by Min Li, PhD and Resham Bhattacharya, PhD, who have complementary expertise in
investigating basic mechanisms of cancer (Li) and translating discoveries into clinical trials (Bhattacharya).
In 2021, the CB program had 39 total members (23 full, 16 associate), representing 11 different academic
departments. Total peer-reviewed research funding was $6.38M, of which $2.15M was from NCI (annual,
direct cost). More than a third (34%) of total peer-reviewed funding was from NCI, highlighting the cancer focus
of this basic science-oriented program. Total research funding was $7.29M, with 58 active cancer-focused
projects. CB members published 439 articles in peer-reviewed journals over the past five years. Of these, 24%
were intra-programmatic and an exceptional 41% were inter-programmatic, underscoring the high degree of
collaboration, both within the program and with members in the SCC’s Cancer Therapeutics (CT) and Cancer
Prevention and Control (CPC) programs. Multi-institutional publications (n=297) account for 68% of the total.
The number and percentage of high-impact publications increased over the period, from 12 (14%) in 2017 to
24 (24%) in 2021, averaging 18% for the period. This significant increase in high-impact publications highlights
the quality of science being conducted by CB members."
10838556,"CANCER THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Cancer Therapeutics (CT) program is to translate discoveries through: 1)
development of new therapeutic agents, 2) biotechnology and bioengineering approaches, and 3) innovative
clinical trials in order to enhance cancer diagnosis and treatment and improve patient outcomes. CT is a new
program in this CCSG application, resulting from the significant growth of clinical and translational research
across solid and hematologic tumors and a strategic realignment of the SCC’s former three programs. It better
positions the SCC for strategically driven growth in these areas and allows for greater catchment area impact.
The CT program is led by Lacey McNally, PhD and Kathleen Moore, MD, who bring complementary
expertise in developing agents and technologies and translating these into clinical trials that can have a
positive impact on patients with cancer.
In 2021, the CT program had 38 members (23 full, 15 associate), representing 13 academic departments at
two campuses (31 at OUHSC; 7 at OU Norman). Of these 38 members, 20 are MDs, underscoring the need to
have a programmatic home within the SCC for clinical trialists and clinician scientists focused in all cancer
types. An additional 75 CT affiliate members (non-CCSG category), including many SCC clinician
investigators, help advance CT program aims. Total peer-reviewed research funding was $6.54M, of which
$4.33M was from NCI (annual, direct cost). Significantly, NCI funding accounts for 66% of total peer-reviewed
funding, highlighting the strong cancer-focus of the CT program. Total peer-reviewed research funding
increased by 29% over the grant cycle ($5.06M to $6.54M), with NCI increasing by 34% ($3.23M to $4.33M).
The number of peer-reviewed projects rose from 23 (2017) to 35 (2021), a 52% increase highlighting
programmatic growth and diversity of research activity. CT members published 755 manuscripts in peer-
reviewed journals over the past five years (3.97 / member / year). Of these, 154 (20%) were intra-
programmatic, 190 (25%) were inter-programmatic, and 570 (75%) were multi-institutional, demonstrating the
high degree of collaboration between CT members, with members in other SCC programs, and with
investigators at other institutions. Importantly, 161 (21%) of CT member publications were published in high-
impact journals (impact factor ≥10). During the reporting period, 3,652 patients were accrued to CT clinical
trials, including 3,095 to interventional treatment trials. The number of annual active CT member interventional
treatment IITs increased from 4 (2017) to 21 (2021), highlighting the expanding depth and breadth of
translational activity emanating from the program."
10838558,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) program is to understand and address high-
impact cancers and cancer-related disparities in Oklahoma (SCC catchment area), with a focus on disparities
in the state's American Indian (AI), Black / African American (Black/AA), rural, and other socioeconomically
disadvantaged populations. Specific aims of the program focus on: 1) identifying genetic, environmental,
behavioral, and social risk factors that contribute to high cancer incidence and disparities in Oklahoma; 2)
developing, evaluating and implementing interventions to reduce to cancer incidence and mortality; and 3)
improving cancer outcomes through enhancing care access, delivery and survivorship. Close interactions with
the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) Associate Director (Mark Doescher, MD) and Core help
facilitate catchment area-focused research and community partnerships. CPC program aims have evolved
since the last CCSG, driven by center and program planning, new strategic opportunities, maturation of
program activities, and in response to emerging cancer problems in the catchment area. Revised program
aims now reflect a broader scope as well as greater integration and synergy of activity to address cancer in the
catchment area.
The CPC program has 43 members (25 full and 18 associate), representing 18 academic departments and a
range of transdisciplinary expertise, including: cancer health disparities, community-based participatory
research; novel interventions for tobacco prevention and cessation; emerging tobacco products; basic
mechanisms of addiction; care coordination, delivery and survivorship; and basic mechanisms of treatment-
related side effects. The CPC program made significant progress during past five years on all metrics for
programmatic activities. The CPC program has experienced significant increases in NCI ($2.64M  $3.65M)
and total peer-reviewed research funding ($5.58M  $7.27M) since the last CCSG, reflecting strategic
planning, targeted recruitment, allocation of developmental funds, and value-added support from the SCC. Key
publication metrics have also significantly increased since the last CCSG, including: intra-programmatic (36%
 40%), inter-programmatic (6%  29%), multi-institutional (64%  82%), and high impact (1%  8%)
[impact factor ≥10]. The nearly five-fold increase in inter-programmatic collaborative publications directly
addresses a program critique in the prior CCSG. The CPC program hosts numerous training and mentorship
programs for under- and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty. The CPC program is led by
Paul Spicer, PhD, Darla Kendzor, PhD, and C.V. Rao, PhD, who have diverse and complementary
transdisciplinary expertise to advance program aims."
10838561,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
Oklahoma has the fourth highest overall cancer mortality rate in the United States. High rates of poverty, lack
of health insurance coverage, obesity and tobacco use, and low rates of cancer screening all contribute to the
state’s excess cancer risk. Furthermore, Oklahoma’s cancer health disparities are strikingly higher for the
state’s American Indian (AI), Black / African American (Black/AA), rural, and other underserved minority
populations. The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), the only NCI-designated cancer center in Oklahoma,
leads efforts to decrease the state's cancer burden through facilitating scientific discovery, and by engaging
with patients and communities in the statewide catchment area. SCC's Community Outreach and Engagement
(COE) Core is central in this effort. COE is guided by four interconnected Specific Aims: 1) to monitor and
evaluate the Oklahoma Catchment Area (OKCA) cancer burden and disparities through surveillance of cancer
incidence, mortality, survival, and risk factors; 2) to engage communities throughout the OKCA in bidirectional
communication to stimulate planning of cancer research and control efforts; 3) to communicate community
needs to SCC Leadership, Research Programs and the Clinical Trials Office / Protocol Review and Monitoring
System to catalyze research focusing on high-priority cancers and cancer problems affecting the OKCA; and 4)
to collaboratively implement and disseminate SCC cancer control activities and policies to reduce cancer
burden throughout the OKCA and beyond. Under the direction of Mark Doescher, MD, MSPH, the SCC's
Associate Director for Community Outreach and Engagement, and Dorothy Rhoades, MD, MPH (Kiowa), who
is the SCC's Director of AI Cancer Research Initiatives, COE has achieved a strong record of creating and
sustaining authentic partnerships with Oklahoma’s AI, Black/AA, rural, and other communities to address
multiple cancer-related concerns. Increasingly, COE is applying its expertise to extend outreach to and
collaboration with additional underserved communities in the OKCA, including the Hispanic/Latino/a. COE
conducts surveillance to identify priority cancers and cancer problems having the heaviest impact on
Oklahomans. COE community advisory boards enable community members to inform programmatic and
research priorities for the SCC and its catchment area. COE increasingly links communities to training and
education programs that diversify the cancer research workforce. Strategic plans for the next five years include
expanding community-engaged research focused on addressing priority cancers across the OKCA, as guided
by a logic model that includes short-, intermediate- and long-term metrics that are used to gauge progress and
signal areas for future growth. COE’s cultivation of long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships with
communities will continue to foster an environment that enables SCC to advance its vision to eliminate cancer
health disparities in the state."
10844601,"Abstract/Project Summary – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The vision of the Center for Perioperative Mental Health is to incorporate mental health as a key component of
perioperative care. With this vision in mind, the Administrative Core’s mission will be to develop strategies and
tactics to inform both the overarching directions of the Center and specific important decisions. The
Administrative Core will coordinate the various components of the Center to ensure progress and impact. The
Core will provide intellectual and logistical support to the investigators and to the extended members of the

10844606,"Abstract/Project Summary – PROJECT 1
By 2030, 4 million older adults will undergo elective total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA), the most
common elective surgical procedures intended to mitigate pain and physical disability in this age group. Mental
health problems are highly prevalent in these patients, with 20-30% reporting substantial symptoms of anxiety
and depression both pre- and post-operatively. Depression and anxiety worsen THA/TKA outcomes by (i)
reducing participation in rehabilitation, thereby impeding recovery, (ii) heightening susceptibility to pain which
increases the risk of revision surgery and increases the likelihood of prolonged opioid use, and (iii) raising the
risk for delirium and delayed neurocognitive recovery. Despite the documented impact on individuals and our
health care system, effective interventions that treat anxiety and depression have not been applied to and
evaluated for older adults undergoing THA/TKA. In this proposal, we will optimize and test a pharmacological
and behavioral intervention bundle for older patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, with
clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms. In this proposal, we will institute a perioperative mental
healthcare bundle including: (1) applying a proven behavioral intervention, behavioral activation (BA), with
strategies based on patient preferences and needs; and (2) medication optimization and deprescribing (MOD),
targeting to optimize dosages of anti-depressant medications, and stopping harmful or ineffective medications.
Aim 1 (Adaptation): Informed by a collaborative planning approach, we will adapt, develop and implement an
optimal perioperative mental health intervention bundle for older adults undergoing major orthopedic
procedures. Through stakeholder input, we will develop and iteratively adapt a behavioral and medication
optimization intervention bundle for implementation in this population. Following initial protocol development,
through treatment development trials, we will iteratively optimize the intervention through interactive feedback
from patients over the age of 65 undergoing major orthopedic intervention, and other stakeholders, noting
barriers and facilitators to program completion. Aim 2 (Testing): Using a hybrid Type 1 randomized controlled
trial design, we will compare the effectiveness of the intervention bundle with usual care in reducing symptoms
of depression and anxiety in older patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. For this aim, 100 patients with
symptoms of depression and anxiety will be randomly assigned to the pharmacological and behavioral
intervention bundle or usual care. Pre-operative depression and anxiety are associated with a host of adverse
outcomes after surgery, including complications, falls, delirium, and pain. Thus, medication optimization,
deprescribing, and behavioral treatment of depression and anxiety in older adults undergoing total joint
arthroplasty may improve symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as other important post-operative
outcomes."
10844607,"Abstract/Project Summary – PROJECT 2
Depression and anxiety are under-recognized and undertreated in older adults with cancer. More than a million
older adults will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Each of these individuals are at greater risk for
depression/anxiety than the general older population. The perioperative period is a particularly vulnerable time,
as the patient is concurrently confronted with a life-changing diagnosis as well as functional and physical
changes that accompany a major surgery. Most older adults with both cancer and depression/anxiety do not
receive appropriate mental health treatment, and if they do, it is typically pharmacologic treatment only, further
exacerbating already rampant polypharmacy. In this proposal, we will optimize and test a tailored
pharmacological and behavioral intervention bundle for older patients undergoing surgery for cancer, with
clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms. We will institute a perioperative mental healthcare
intervention bundle including: (1) applying a proven behavioral intervention, behavioral activation (BA), with
strategies based on patient preferences and needs; and (2) medication optimization and deprescribing (MOD),
targeting to optimize dosages of anti-depressant medications, and stopping harmful or ineffective medications.
Aim 1 (Adaptation): Informed by a collaborative planning approach, we will adapt, develop and implement an
optimal perioperative mental health intervention bundle for older adults undergoing planned cancer surgery.
Through stakeholder input, we will develop and iteratively adapt a behavioral and medication optimization
intervention bundle for implementation in this population. Following initial protocol development, through
treatment development trials, we will iteratively optimize the intervention through interactive feedback from
patients over the age of 65 undergoing major surgery for cancer, and other stakeholders, noting barriers and

we will compare the effectiveness of the intervention bundle with usual care in reducing symptoms of
depression and anxiety in older patients with cancer undergoing oncologic surgery. For this aim, 100 patients
with symptoms of depression and anxiety will be randomly assigned to the pharmacological and behavioral

Depression and anxiety are common but undertreated in older adults undergoing cardiac surgical procedures.
Approximately 400,000 older adults undergo cardiac surgery annually in the United States, and between a
quarter and a half of these individuals have symptoms of preoperative anxiety or depression. Each of these
individuals are at greater risk for depression/anxiety than the general older population. The perioperative
period is a particularly vulnerable time, as the patient is concurrently confronted with social, functional and
physical changes that accompany a major surgery. Most older adults with heart disease and depression or

10843288,"Overall—Abstract
Adults in South Africa are surviving to older ages, yet the burden and risk factors of aging-related diseases,
particularly dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, remains poorly defined. By 2050, more than 75% of global
dementia cases are projected to occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The proposed renewal of
the Health, Aging and Dementia in South Africa: A Longitudinal Study (HAALSI) Program includes four
tightly integrated projects supported by three cores that together will reveal interrelationships among common
chronic diseases and other risk factors of cognitive impairment and dementia in South Africa. Each project
rests on a common platform of individual surveys, cognitive assessments, biomarker collection, and mortality
ascertainment, with additional measures specific to each project. In previous funding cycles (2014-2022), we
successfully collected three waves of HAALSI Agincourt data in 5059 men and women ≥40 years of age,
achieving response rates of 86-94% among living cohort members. We also collected two waves of data under
the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) at 3-year intervals. For this renewal application, the
HAALSI Program will continue following the HAALSI Agincourt cohort (Aim 1), including original enrollees and
a refresher sample of 1898, 40- to 49-year-olds, for a total of 13 years of longitudinal data. We will conduct a
third HCAP wave on a subsample of the HAALSI Agincourt cohort, with expanded biomarker, neuroimaging,
and clinical assessments to understand interactions among cognitive impairment/dementia, HIV infection, and
cardiometabolic disorders (CMDs). In Aim 2, we will identify biological, social, and economic predictors of
mortality and dementia, and assess disease incidence and changes in physical and cognitive function in the
HAALSI Agincourt cohort. In addition, in Aim 3, we will pilot and launch a nationally representative cohort study
of 4500 people ≥40 years of age and their partners (approximately 7200 total) using approaches from the
HAALSI Agincourt survey; of these, approximately 624 will also undergo the HCAP. The HAALSI National
survey will enable us to estimate the prevalence of dementia and other aging-related conditions, and their
cross-sectional associations with socioeconomic, behavioral, and health utilization exposures. We will use
innovative transportability methods to assess the alignment of diseases in the rural Agincourt community with
the national level. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the health impacts of public health and social policies developed to
improve healthy aging, specifically those aimed at reducing salt intake, and increasing financial security of
older adults, families, and individuals with disabilities. Finally, in Aim 5, we will maximize collaborations with
HRS sister studies, H3Africa and DS-I Africa projects, enabling cross-country comparisons and studies at the
level of population genetics. Together, the HAALSI Program will produce valuable insights into the burden and
drivers of dementia and other aging-related diseases in South Africa, which inform the development of effective
policies to ensure healthy aging and wellbeing of aging populations."

CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION
The goals of the Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination Core (CRTEC) of Winship Cancer
Institute of Emory University (Winship) are: (1) to provide research training and education opportunities to build
a pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; (2) to ensure their success through mentorship and career development
programs; and (3) to leverage existing programs across Emory University to enhance cancer research training
and education. To facilitate these goals, Winship has made a significant annual investment averaging
$850,000/year during the present funding period in education and training programs. Winship has a long-
standing record of developing and supporting cancer-focused programs for the spectrum of learners from middle
school through graduate school. In addition, through collaborative partnerships, cancer-related training has been
integrated into training programs across Emory University. CRTEC has facilitated successful submission of F-
and K- applications from trainees across all four Winship research programs. For post-graduates, Winship career
development activities include support for early career investigators through programs for physician-scientists,
NCI K12 award in Clinical Oncology for physicians, and an American Cancer Society Institutional Research
Grant (ACS-IRG) with Diversity in Cancer Research supplements that include summer support for undergraduate
students and pilot funding for early-stage investigators from historically underrepresented groups. A pre-
submission review process by the Winship Scientific Research Council and Shared Resource Leaders is in place
for trainees and faculty to enhance successful outcomes for grant submissions. Winship also provides numerous
continuing education opportunities for faculty, staff, and clinicians in the community. As a result of these efforts,
36 trainees across three T32 programs conducted cancer research during the reporting period. Since 2016, 24
students in Winship member labs received an F31, four received an F30 and 5 received F99 awards. Of 31
domestic students in the Cancer Biology Graduate Program, 12 (39%) were from populations underrepresented
in STEM. Sixteen out of 17 graduates of the Winship-supported Research Ethics Fellowship Program proceeded
to a career in medicine or research. Taken together, CRTEC promotes high quality cancer training to develop
the next generation of cancer clinicians and researchers to transform cancer research, prevention, care, and
education and reduce the cancer burden in the Winship catchment area."
10848258,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY
Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is strongly committed to promoting the careers of women,
minorities, and individuals from historically underrepresented groups (HUGs) to create a diverse oncology
research workforce and leadership for the future. For purposes of the Winship Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED),
HUGs refer to individuals who are women, Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ, first-in-college, from rural areas, and lower
socio-economic status to align with the needs of the catchment area. The Winship PED leverages existing
educational programs, faculty development programs, formal programs for leadership development, and
mentorship to advance the careers of individuals from HUGs. Winship also seeks to enhance connectivity with
historically black colleges and universities in Georgia and members of the community to develop a more diverse
pipeline of researchers for the future. The PED will grow the infrastructure and resources available to ensure
long term sustained efforts at Winship to increase diversity among trainees, members, and leaders. Winship
membership is comprised of 487 faculty members (179 core and 308 associate members) that includes 9%
Black or Hispanic, 38% women, and 30% of Asian race. Winship’s Executive Committee currently consists of 15
members: 33% women, 20% Black or Hispanic, and 13% Asian. Among leaders of the four Winship research
programs, 25% are women and 75% are Asian. Forty-three percent of Winship’s shared resource leaders (nine
full and two developing shared resources) are women. Winship’s External Advisory Board of 19 members
includes 53% women and 11% Black/Hispanic individuals. While the demographics of Winship leadership and
advisory board are comparable to national trends, Winship recognizes the need for further improvements.
Winship is dedicated to the belief that diversity strengthens cancer science across the research continuum. With
the proposed PED, by strengthening efforts to build a more diverse cancer research workforce, and to foster
critical diversity among cancer center leadership, Winship enables greater creativity, encourages more thoughtful
consideration of ways to overcome barriers to prevention, treatment, and quality of cancer care, and supports
the cancer center’s plans to more fully reflect the catchment area which it serves. Consequently, these efforts
will accelerate Winship’s mission of discovering cures for cancer and inspiring hope."

CANCER IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAM
The Cancer Immunology (CI) Program of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) conducts
research that seeks to prevent and treat cancer by harnessing the immune system. The CI program was added
as a new scientific program in 2019 to bring together the growing number of faculty conducting basic, clinical,
and translational research in cancer immunology at Winship. The overall goal of the CI program is to conduct
transformational research to reduce the cancer burden among patients and populations at risk for cancer. Cancer
immunology research at Winship has already made seminal contributions to the development of
immunotherapies for cancer and has helped to define fundamental principles that guide immunotherapy
response. The overall scientific goals of the program are: (1) to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying regulation of anti-tumor immunity, and (2) to discover and test new immunologic approaches to treat
or prevent cancer. Under the leadership of Madhav Dhodapkar, MBBS (leader), and Rafi Ahmed, PhD (co-
leader), the CI Program includes 25 core members representing 11 different departments within the School of
Medicine (SOM). This highly collaborative group of researchers has published a total of 293 cancer-relevant
scientific articles during the current funding period. Of these, 49 (17%) were intra- and 127 (43%) were inter-
programmatic collaborations, 197 (67%) involved a collaboration with another institution and 89 (30%) were
published in journals with an impact factor > 10. As of December 31, 2021, CI members held $9.15 million in
annual program direct costs, of which $6.4 million was peer-reviewed and $3.5 million (55%) was awarded
from the NCI. Program members play leadership roles in several Winship team science programs including
NCI-funded lung cancer SPORE and P01 awards and a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Specialized Center
of Research (SCOR) award in multiple myeloma, all newly awarded during the reporting period. Impactful CI
scientific contributions include i) development of abatacept to prevent acute graft versus host disease, ultimately
leading to FDA approval in 2021, ii) definition of antigen-specific B and T cells in tumor microenvironment of
head/neck cancer with practice-changing immunotherapeutic implications, iii) identification of antigen-
presenting-cell niches within tumors that may be key mechanism of immune escape, and iv) definition of the
CD8 T cells that provide the proliferative burst after PD-1 immunotherapy. CI program leaders develop
programmatic content, meetings, and retreats, and foster a rich and diverse research environment which
enhances training for the next generation of cancer researchers and promotes career development of under-
represented scholars. CI interacts closely with Winship Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) to address
catchment area priorities and engage in bi-directional communication with community stakeholders. Built on
Winship's enabling resources and infrastructure for innovation and team-science, including >$850,000 of pilot
funding, CI is poised to make major contributions to the field of cancer immunology and immunotherapy."

DISCOVERY & DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM
The Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics (DDT) Program accelerates discoveries that drive cancer
diagnosis, detection, drug delivery, and therapeutic approaches with the premise that multidisciplinary
interactions among DDT members will advance highly innovative anti-cancer strategies. The program includes
three scientific themes: (1) Discovery, the discovery and evaluation of therapeutic targets and novel small
molecules; (2) Cancer Imaging, the development and/or utilization of in vivo imaging agents and technologies
for non-invasive diagnostic/therapeutic cancer applications; and (3) Developmental Therapeutics, human
interventional cancer trials using novel therapies and individualized treatment options by functioning as a
convergence point for translation of targets, imaging, therapeutic agents, and immunotherapies. The productive
bench to bedside research of DDT members furnishes a rich training environment for the next generation of
cancer researchers with integrated activities to promote biomedical science careers of under-represented
groups. Strong engagement with Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) drives prioritization of catchment

CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM
The Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship)
coordinates and promotes all cancer prevention and control-related research activities within the center. The
goal of CPC Program is to generate knowledge through innovative research and learning from the community,
that will transform cancer prevention and care and reduce the cancer burden in Winship’s catchment area, the
state of Georgia, and beyond. CPC has four scientific themes: (1) Cancer Epidemiology - to achieve high quality
surveillance of the cancer burden and identify risk factors such as biological, behavioral, social and policy factors,
and environmental exposures, to inform targeted interventions and strategies to reduce cancer risk in Georgia;
(2) Interventions - focus on HPV vaccination uptake, individual behavioral interventions to reduce tobacco use
and to prevent weight gain, and policy and systems-level changes with the ultimate goal of broad-scale
implementation of effective strategies; (3) Cancer Survivorship and Symptom Management - focus on treatment-
related early effects, including patient-reported outcomes, biobehavioral changes in the brain, childhood and
adolescent cancer survivors transition to primary care, and late effects such as cardiovascular disease, which
substantially affect the quality-of-life of cancer patients and survivors; and (4) Quality of Cancer Care - to conduct
population-based research that describes, interprets, and predicts the impact of health care interventions and
other factors on adherence to care, quality of cancer care, inequities in care, and outcomes. Under the leadership
of Timothy L. Lash, DSc, MPH (leader) and Mylin Torres, MD (co-leader), CPC includes 53 core members
representing 16 different departments within the School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing,
and Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. This diverse membership furnishes a rich research
training environment for the next generation of cancer researchers. CPC engages in ongoing interactions with
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) to inform research on catchment area priorities and actively
engages in promoting biomedical scientific careers for under-represented groups. This highly collaborative group
of researchers published 1,074 cancer-relevant scientific articles during the current funding period. Of these, 275

COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) for Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) has
been built on a strong foundation of catchment area assessment, community-engaged research, and
dissemination of evidence-based interventions. In its efforts to reduce cancer disparities in Winship's catchment
area, the state of Georgia, COE has assessed the cancer burden and priorities; identified special populations of
interest and significant disparities; collaborated with community partners on strategic planning; established
measurable outcomes; and thoughtfully allocated its budget in support of infrastructure and activities to advance
COE goals. The availability of unique resources to support population-based studies, e.g., the Georgia SEER
state-wide registry and regional cancer coalitions, has been highlighted and strengthened. With the appointment
of a new cancer center Executive Director, Suresh Ramalingam, MD (DDT), and a new associate director for
COE, Theresa Gillespie, PhD, MA, RN, FAAN (CPC), and in collaboration with Winship's Community Advisory
Board and statewide partners, Winship COE has launched a novel series of innovative and wide-ranging
endeavors. New approaches have been established to ensure bi-directional communication with community and
patient stakeholders, across the entire cancer research continuum. Community partnerships inform and guide
Winship research program portfolios, clinical trials, dissemination and outreach, and translation to policy. The
overall goal of COE is to facilitate catchment area-relevant research, including community-engaged research,
and disseminate evidence-based interventions, to reduce disparities and the cancer burden across Georgia.
This goal will be accomplished through three specific aims: (1) assess, prioritize, monitor, and communicate
catchment area needs and priorities; (2) facilitate and inform Winship programmatic research portfolios, clinical
trials, and strategic planning responsive to catchment area priorities through bi-directional exchanges with
community stakeholders; and (3) disseminate evidence-based interventions and promote policy impact and
translation to the catchment area, nationally and globally. COE initiated a comprehensive approach to catchment
area assessment, priority-setting, and communication internally and externally. To study underlying basic
mechanisms that contribute to poor outcomes and disparities in Georgia, COE hosted discussions on
mechanistic models and connected basic, translational, and population scientists with community and patient
advocates, resulting in submission of multiple proposals. COE transformed accrual monitoring and redesign of
the clinical trials process for investigator-initiated studies, so that both patient advocates and population
scientists/disparities experts are directly involved with trials development from the concept phase onward. To
promote dissemination of evidence-based interventions, screening, and clinical trials accrual, COE-funded FTEs
are embedded in regional cancer coalitions to advance research priorities and reduce cancer burden. COE
encouraged adoption of statewide and national policy for impact beyond the catchment area."

DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) utilizes CCSG developmental funds in combination with
philanthropic and institutional funds to drive strategic priorities and foster innovative cancer research. During the
current cycle, funds were utilized to support two developmental shared resources: the Winship Data and
Technology Applications Shared Resource (Data SR) and the Intervention Development, Dissemination, and
Implementation Shared Resource (Dissemination SR). Both have advanced to full shared resources in this
application. Funds were also used to support the Winship Invest$ pilot grant program. Winship Invest$ follows
bi-annual funding cycles and a standardized peer-review process. A custom technology platform is utilized to
manage the pilot grant program. This platform is integrated with the Winship administrative database and
integrates funding, outcomes, and membership data. It is also used to manage documents, member surveys,
and the review process. Winship Administration has established post-award processes to monitor funds and
provide reports for leadership evaluation of program effectiveness. During the current funding period, CCSG
developmental funds ($900,000) were awarded to 15 pilot projects and resulted in receipt of $2.6 million of
external funding to date. CCSG funded awards from prior period (2013-2017, 24 awards, $778,000) resulted in
$14.4 million external funding with average time of 30 months to first funding after award start date. Similar
growth is anticipated for pilot funds from the current funding period. Winship also distributed $5.1 million in
philanthropic, institutional, and other peer-reviewed funds during the reporting period for a total of $6 million
allocated to 122 pilot awards and leading to $16.4 million in external funding. Findings from CCSG-funded
research have been disseminated in high impact journals such as Nature, Nature Cancer, Nature
Communications, and Journal of Clinical Oncology. Winship developmental funds have resulted in other
noteworthy outcomes, such as the advancement of multidisciplinary team science research, career development
for junior investigators, health disparities research, and performance of investigator-initiated clinical research.
This competitive renewal requests developmental funds for continued support of Winship Invest$ with plans to
fund 15-20 pilot grants with award amounts of $50,000 to $100,000 each. To build a pipeline of clinical trials
development expertise, Winship also plans to fund one early-stage clinical investigator award per year with each
award providing two years of support. Developmental funds in combination with institutional and philanthropic
funds are a critical resource for the Executive Director and the leadership team to strategically support innovative
research ideas and develop new research themes. These funds will enable Winship to continue its growth as a
transformative leader integrating cancer research, education, care, and community impact to achieve its mission."

SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The overarching goal of the Winship shared resources (SRs) is to provide comprehensive research services and
expertise to meet the present and future needs of Winship members across all four scientific research programs.
Winship SRs have grown to nine `full' (six in the previous submission) and two `developing' SRs (dSR) that are
aligned with the research programs through effective shared resource management (SRM). Two SRs (Data SR
and Dissemination SR) transitioned from `developing' to `full' SRs and Flow SR launched during the reporting
period to meet program member needs. These nine SRs highlight the growth in the SR service portfolio which
stems from increased SR usage, needs-assessment of Winship researchers, and opportunistic partnerships
across the university to expand services and align with the Winship strategic plan. SRM has three overarching
aims that seek to provide cutting-edge and cost-effective SRs, deploy effective infrastructure and governance,
and monitor the future scientific needs to guide the launch of new services and technologies. Winship SRs are
integral to multiple team science grants, publications, major strategic research initiatives and educational events.
Annual Winship SR usage by members increased 25% from 85 members in CY2016 to 106 members in
CY2021 with a total SR usage of 149 unique Winship members from all programs during this time period. SR
services have supported 539 peer-reviewed cancer-related publications (22% in journals with impact factor >10)
from Winship members and 225 peer-reviewed grants from CY2016 to CY2021. Winship increased the space
allocated to shared resources by >60%, with a total of 28,607 gross square feet (gsf) (up from 17,562 gsf in
2016), including a $5 million investment in the renovation of a newly renovated 8,800 gsf SR Hub. In total,
Winship has invested $20.9 million in shared resources since 2017 resulting in the purchase of new
equipment, newly renovated space, and hiring additional personnel. The future plans for SRM align with the
Winship strategic plan and include capital and personnel investments in the developing Immune dSR and Cell
Therapy dSR, growth of services/technologies in existing SRs, expanded Winship support for extramural SR
grant applications, and expanded educational and diversity enhancement initiatives."

trial access for patients in the catchment area, emphasizing underrepresented populations. CPDM includes the
Winship Clinical Trials Office (CTO), clinical data management team, regulatory specialists, quality management
(QM), training/education, and the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC). This research infrastructure
is led by interim Associate Director for Clinical Research Edmund Waller, MD, PhD (CI), and CTO Medical
Director R. Donald Harvey, PharmD (DDT), under the direct leadership of Winship Executive Director Suresh
Ramalingam, MD (DDT). CTO operational leadership is provided by CTO Director Amy Overby, who oversees
all clinical research staff and a group of experienced managers across each CTO function. The CTO provides
infrastructure including trial development, activation, conduct, data collection and analysis, and QM monitoring
(including in-person/remote site) and audits with a specialized team focused on multi-institutional trials. In
addition, the CTO provides orientation and ongoing training for Winship members, faculty, and staff across all
aspects of clinical research. The clinical data management team and regulatory specialists are organized by
cancer site and treatment modality working groups. The Winship trials portfolio is balanced between institutional,
industry-sponsored, externally peer-reviewed, and NCI-supported National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and
Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) trials. The DSMC oversees implementation of the
Winship Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) to ensure a high level of compliance. During the 2017-2021
funding period, 936 interventional and non-interventional protocols were activated at Winship. CPDM also
supported the recruitment of 3,940 accruals to interventional treatment trials (representing a 23% increase
compared to prior reporting period) across 732 protocols; approximately 41% of enrollments were on institutional
or externally peer-reviewed trials. Of these, Black patients comprise 25% of the interventional treatment accruals
at Winship, which is comparable to the proportion of Black cancer patients in Georgia. The DSMC monitored
358 protocols, resulting in 549 reviews of IITs and national group trials. Analyses of performance metrics for trial
conduct demonstrate steady improvements in key measures including accrual, activation times, and protocol
compliance. Currently 333 adult therapeutic clinical trials, and 97 pediatric therapeutic trials are open to
enrollment at Winship. During the next funding period, Winship will continue to increase patient accrual with an
emphasis on the affiliate sites and continued focus on historically underrepresented groups."
10904652,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Overall
Our Program Project Grant (PPG) focuses on the complex interplay between the chronically infarcted heart
and sympathetic nervous system (SNS), with the goal of defining precise mechanisms of ventricular
arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The overarching objective of the PPG is to test ‘The Spatiotemporal
Heterogeneity of Neurotransmitter Release Hypothesis’ that postulates scars alter the ultrastructure of nerves
and result in non-uniform neurotransmitter release in the myocardium which is a crucial and proximate cause
of lethal arrhythmias. We propose to 1) understand the maladaptive interactions between the chronically
injured heart and the SNS, and 2) using this framework to investigate the mechanisms by which chronic vagal
nerve stimulation (VNS) as a prototypical neuromodulation therapy exerts its beneficial effects and gain
broader insights. Our PPG team has made seminal discoveries in cardiac neural control, cardiomyocyte
electrophysiologic function, control of ventricular tachycardia circuits at the myocardial level, and the complex
multicellular paradigms that underlie sympathetic neuronal dysfunction within stellate ganglia, the major source
of enhanced postganglionic sympathetic drive to the injured heart. These discoveries are relevant to the
electrophysiologic instabilities that underlie susceptibility to lethal ventricular arrhythmias and are a result of
the multifaceted collaborations between our PPG project & core leaders, and the broader study team. In
Project 1, Dr. Shivkumar and his colleagues will utilize novel 3D cardiac electrical mapping approaches
combined with real time in vivo neurotransmitter/neuropeptide detection in normal and chronically infarcted
beating hearts to define the mechanisms of physiologic and pathophysiologic nerve-myocyte interactions. In
Project 2, Dr. Harvey and colleagues will study, at the single myocyte level, how various neurotransmitters
(alone and in combinations seen in the normal and diseased myocardial milieu) impact cardiomyocytes from
normal hearts and from the scar-border zone. In Project 3, Dr. Ajijola and his colleagues will investigate the
source of excessive and dysfunctional sympathetic neurotransmission to the heart, specifically inflammation in
the stellate ganglia. Project 3 will investigate how maladaptive interactions between neurons and other cell
types such as glia and immune cells lead to dysfunctional control of the chronically injured heart. These three
component projects will be supported by two scientific cores, led by Drs. Ardell and Ajijola and an
administrative core led by Dr. Shivkumar. The scientific cores will provide a stream of normal and diseased
human hearts and stellate ganglia for studies in Projects 1-3, as well as high throughput tissue clearing
techniques and high-resolution imaging (Core A). The cores also aim to reproducibly generate experimental
porcine models and oversee technologies for in vivo neuropeptide/neurotransmitter release (Core B). Our PPG
team is confident in its success as we are building on pre-existing intellectual and deep collaborative
relationships among the teams and are enthusiastic about the novel hypotheses being tested utilizing
innovative tools and approaches."
10904653,"ABSTRACT – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core of this NHLBI Program Project Grant (PPG) will serve the following key functions:
general administration, accounting, clerical support, data administration, and organizing the internal &
external advisory board meetings. The coordination of research activities and the handling of routine
paperwork for the University of California and the National Institutes of Health necessitate a strong and
efficient administrative component.
General administration includes supervision (by the core leader, Dr. Kalyanam Shivkumar) with the assistance
of the Co-I Dr. Jeffrey Ardell for the data and resource management components. Amiksha Gandhi, assisting
with clerical and accounting functions, scheduling weekly PPG meetings, assistance with travel
arrangements, handling paperwork for travel reimbursements. She will also be assisting with material
transfer agreements, solving computer software and connectivity issues, organizing documents for
domestic and international shipments, and notifying project and core leaders of due dates for the animal
research applications, radiation safety applications, biosafety applications, and training courses.
The clerical component includes final formatting of reports and manuscripts, preparing bibliographies,
writing and distributing memos, sending emails to PPG staff, coordinating letters of collaboration,
performing final formatting of the project and core reports for our external advisory board meeting.
The accounting component includes ordering and receiving supplies purchased by the cores and
projects, tracking and recording deliveries, returning damaged shipments or supplies that were delivered
by mistake, maintaining laboratory equipment service contracts, managing consortium agreements, and
maintaining financial ledgers in accordance with university procedures. In coordinating these functions,
Dr. Shivkumar will work closely with both Ms. Amiksha Gandhi.
Planning the annual external advisory board meeting is an important duty of the Administrative Core;
preparing for the external advisory board meeting involves assembling the annual report, assisting with
travel, housing and transportation for the external advisors, reserving a retreat location, and deciding the
menu and dining arrangements (luncheons, coffee breaks, and evening dinners).

10904655,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Scientific Core - Structure
The goal of the Ultrastructural Assessment and Human Tissue Core is to maximize the scientific progress and
productivity of the PPG investigators by providing essential services. The primary function of Core A is to serve
human and porcine myocardial and stellate ganglion tissue needs across all projects and Core B. Given
significant regulatory and logistical hurdles needed to procure and study human heart and stellate ganglion
tissues, it is ideal for this to be handled by a central core. The core will perform three key functions for the
study: 1) tissue clearing and ultrastructural imaging; 2) procurement of normal (or near normal) and diseased
human tissues, specifically hearts and stellate ganglia; and 3) molecular biology. All 3 projects of this PPG with
utilize at least two of these services, and there will be tight links between this core and Core B, the Functional
Assessment and Instrumentation Core. Over the past 15 months, we have built a pipeline to obtain diseased
hearts from patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation, and normal or near normal hearts rejected for
organ transplant. Our infrastructure for obtained stellate ganglia from patients with cardiomyopathy undergoing
stellectomy, and stellate ganglia from patients without cardiopulmonary disease at the time of heart and/or lung
donation has existed for 5 years. Given the unpredictable times at which these tissues become available,
centralizing the tissue procurement activities within this core will benefit the PPG by streamlining protocols and
approvals, minimizing cost, and boosting productivity. The Core will also streamline the 4-week process of
tissue clearing from pigs and humans by batching tissues to minimize error, tissue clearing involves numerous
steps and chemicals. Finally, it is most ideal that tissues are cleared and imaged in high resolution in close
coordination with study team members from Projects 1-3 in this Core whether or not the tissues are cleared.
For the duration of the PPG, the core is poised – with experience, robust protocols, and experienced personnel
– to provide critical services that ensure the success of this PPG."
10904657,"ABSTRACT – Scientific Core - Function
The primary goal of scientific Core B – “Functional Assessment and Instrumentation core” - is to optimize
bioelectronic technologies for high-resolution, real-time concurrent measurements of cardiac autonomic and
electrophysiological parameters. Core B will support 5 major endeavors that a fundamental to completion of aims
in Projects 1 to 3: Cardiac EP mapping: Advances in analytics for data derived from intra-myocardial multi-pole
electrodes, coupled with the deployment of thin-film 2-D form-fit arrays to the epicardium, will define electrical
heterogeneities across the border zone areas of the ischemic heart. Complementary in vitro studies can be
accomplished in our human heart/Langendorff preparation utilizing either electrical or optical EP mapping.
Neurochemical detection: Autonomic assessment will include real-time measurement of regional cardiac
neurotransmitter release profiles, leveraging electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (catecholamine) and capacitive
immunoprobe (neuropeptide). Such neurochemical measurements can likewise be obtained from vascular
compartment to measure trans-cardiac biomarker release profiles. Telemetry: Continuous monitoring for heart
rate, temperature and activity in conscious porcine subjects. Chronic Vagal Nerve stimulation: Using FDA
approved implantable vagal nerve stimulation devices, animals can be titrated to therapeutic levels of VNS and
maintained in that state throughout the treatment phase. Creation of myocardial infarcts: The UCLA
Neurocardiology Research Program of Excellence has over a decade of experience in creating a chronic porcine
infarct model. This model has been extensively characterized and shown to be comparable to infarcts in patients
with ischemic heart disease in both electrophysiological and histopathological characteristics (1). Importantly,
this model displays significant neural remodeling at the level of the stellate ganglia, intrinsic cardiac nervous
system, and myocardium, making it suitable for the proposed PPG (2, 3). Tasks 3 to 5 are facilitated by the
UCLA Neurocardiology Research Program of Excellence having a dedicated large animal aseptic surgical suite
designed specifically to support all instrumentation and survival surgery aspects of this PPG and 2 dedicated
large animal telemetry rooms capable of monitoring 10 animals at a time."
10848219,"Abstract. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) regulates tissue growth and repair in multiple organs. A conserved
mechanism of synthesis and degradation modulates PGE2 levels in response to trauma, inflammation and
disease. In particular, the enzyme 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the main PGE2-degrading
enzyme and therefore a key regulator of tissue repair and regeneration. 15-PGDH is an attractive drug target
for diseases characterized by tissue damage. Our team successfully developed the first small molecule
inhibitors of 15-PGDH with in vivo activities. In rodents, our inhibitors 1) accelerate recovery following bone
marrow transplantation, 2) accelerate recovery from, or prevent, ulcerative colitis, 3) accelerate regrowth of
liver tissue following partial hepatectomy, 4) ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced disease
model, 5) enhance survival of new hippocampal neurons in adult mice, and 6) preserve cognitive function and
minimize neuronal damage in mice following traumatic brain injury. Independent reports have described
beneficial effects of 15-PGDH inhibition in models of renal disease and pulmonary fibrosis.
We now propose a collaborative chemical, structural and cell-signaling interrogation of the role and activity of
15-PGDH. Our expertise includes medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience, pharmacology, and
structural biology. In Aim 1, we will define and exploit the structural basis for inhibition of 15-PGDH by small
molecules. This aims builds on the first cryoEM structure (2.3 Å resolution) of 15-PGDH and two unrelated
scaffolds of low-nM inhibitors of 15-PGDH. Proposed research aims to solve the structure of 15-PGDH in
complex with new small molecule inhibitors or substrate. Computational approaches will be employed to
interrogate substrate/inhibitor binding and the enzymatic mechanism. In Aim 2, we will define the cellular,
protein and cytokine signaling networks that are regulated by 15-PGDH and that are engaged by 15-PGDH
inhibitors to potentiate tissue regeneration and repair. The foundation of this aim includes the first
demonstration of 15-PGDH activity in the brain, the identification of macrophages and microglia as major
reservoirs of 15-PGDH expression in peripheral tissues and brain, respectively, and the discovery of cell and
cytokine networks that respond to inhibiting 15-PGDH. We now propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing to
determine the cell types that express 15-PGDH. Similar approaches will identify the cell-signaling network of
induced cytokines and the cell types activated to express them. These studies will be performed in mice
recovering from injury that have been treated with 15-PGDH inhibitors, along with appropriate controls. Finally,
we will engineer macrophage- and microglia-targeted 15-PGDH knockouts to define the role of 15-PGDH
expression in macrophages and microglia in mediating a conserved, cross-tissue response to PGE2 and 15-
PGDH inhibitors. This data set will provide a foundation for future advancement of therapeutics targeting 15-
PGDH and additional drug targets that modulate tissue regeneration."

Olfactory impairment may signal prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We currently do not have an established
model that can be tested, in vivo, relating AD neurodegeneration to specific functional deficits in olfaction and
memory. This significant knowledge gap impedes the development of functional imaging markers for the
evaluation and diagnosis of AD.
We have developed several olfactory fMRI paradigms that can probe the dysfunctions in brain regions where
early stage AD neurodegeneration occurs. Our preliminary data suggest an AD neurodegeneration-to-function
model. We hypothesize that progressive neurodegeneration in MCI disrupts the connectivity of the olfactory
network (ON) to the default mode network (DMN) via the Hippocampus, leading to early deficits in olfaction
followed by memory impairment. Our research is designed to test this hypothesized model using functional
connectivity (FC; synchrony among brain regions) in resting state fMRI and effective connectivity (EC; directed
interactions between brain regions) during olfactory task fMRI; neurodegeneration will be evaluated by volumetric
MRI (vMRI).
Aim 1: Determine age-related changes in the ON-DMN network in cognitively normal subjects.
Aim 2: Determine changes in the ON-DMN network in mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects.
Aim 3: Explore the relationships between progressive changes in the ON-DMN network, and cognitive
 decline in MCI subjects
The over-arching goal of the proposed research will be to rigorously test an AD neurodegeneration model that
answers two fundamental questions: a) How are odor-identification and odor-discrimination deficits in AD related
to memory impairment and neurodegeneration? and b) Do olfactory deficits and progressive disruptions to ON-
DMN connectivity signal the development of AD dementia? Research outcomes can provide numerous avenues
for improving olfactory testing as an AD marker. Olfactory tests, which target specific brain areas and processes
that are affected earliest in AD, could hold additional promise for early disease detection and prevention in other
neurodegerative disease, such as Parkinson’s disease."

Brachytherapy procedure is one of the most popular treatment modalities for prostate cancer where cancerous cells are
irradiated and destroyed locally by the radioactive dosage of seeds implanted by the surgeon. The success of brachytherapy
heavily relies on safe and precise placement of the seeds in or adjacent to the cancerous cells. The procedure demands a
very experienced surgeon who have developed an intuitive feel in needle insertions and is able to guide the needle into a
desired location with hand-eye coordination and assistance of an imaging device. However, with conventional rigid needles,
only a straight path is achievable towards the target, and thereby seed placements require several insertions with a high
tissue damage on the needle’s path. A recent study has shown that guiding the needle in a curvilinear approach will decrease
the number of needle insertions required and provide other dosimetric benefits. Lack of actuation and control (after the
needle is inserted into the patient’s body) is another factor that make the procedure challenging. A flexible 3D steerable
“smart” needle with multi-directional actuation and a reliable guidance control and guidance can aid the surgeon to perform
the task with more accuracy, reduced invasiveness, and in a curvilinear approach. Furthermore, teleoperative guidance for
the smart needle will endow the robotic instrument with intelligence. On the other hand, in-depth understanding of the
needle-tissue interaction mechanism (with intraoperative model parameter updates and shape- and force-sensing) is a key
factor in development of an appropriate control and guidance strategies to compensate for system uncertainties. This work
will first develop an active “smart” brachytherapy needle that will provide robust actuation, shape- and force-sensing, and
3D motion in tissue. Then a teleoperative interface with robot-driven smart needle will be developed to perform semi-
automated brachytherapy. Realistic analytical and computational models of needle-tissue interactions will be developed
using realistic tissue characteristics. These models will be used in the control system as dynamic models to make appropriate
decisions during an insertion task. The innovative features of our proposed methods rely on our cutting-edge smart needle
design, new dynamic models, shape- and force-sensing, and control algorithm specifically developed for this application.
The present studies will develop a clinically acceptable size “smart” surgical needle with a robotic control interface and
evaluate its impact in brachytherapy procedure. Utilization of active and passive flexible needles for diagnosis and
therapeutic procedures is a rapidly advancing filed. This proposed research has a high potential to lead to a revolutionary
needle insertion practice in healthcare that is also beneficial to various needle-based procedures such as drug delivery,
biopsy, and interventional therapy where an accurate placement is needed with minimal tissue damage."
10843099,"Project Summary
Each year in the United States alone, 500,000 infants are born preterm (<37 weeks gestation), putting them at
increased risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy and other motor impairments. While
specific clinical populations are known to be at increased risk, the likelihood of disability for any individual child
cannot currently be accurately predicted based upon clinical risk factors alone, limiting our ability to effectively
target therapies and develop new interventions. Prior neuroimaging studies have linked preterm birth to
disrupted development of the motor system, encompassing the motor cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and
cerebellum and associated white matter tracts including the corpus callosum (CC) and corticospinal tract (CST).
While aberrant structural and functional connectivity across these regions have been associated with poorer
motor outcomes, this has not been investigated across childhood in longitudinal cohorts in a way that allows for
individualized outcome prediction. This study proposes to use multiple advanced neuroimaging modalities to
statistically model how changes in neonatal structural and functional connectivity within the motor system can
predict childhood motor outcomes in children born very preterm (VPT; <30 weeks' gestation). This
investigation will leverage a unique, highly valuable, prospective, longitudinal cohort (currently being studied
through R01 MH113570) that includes 175 VPT children, including 41 with cerebral palsy and 68 with other
motor deficits. We collected state-of-the-art neonatal neuroimaging data for these children, including high-
resolution anatomic, functional, and diffusion data. They have also undergone standardized testing of both fine
and gross motor function at ages 2, 5, and 9/10 years, with retention rates >80% across assessment waves.
Across the three aims of this study, latent growth curve models will be created and compared to determine the
individual-level predictive ability of motor system functional connectivity and CC and CST microstructure, both
individually and in combination, on motor trajectories through age 10 years. This project would both advance
our ability to predict outcomes for individual preterm children into middle childhood and build the applicant's
skills in neuroimaging, longitudinal data analysis, and scientific communication in a research environment with
clear expertise in these areas. In the process, she would become proficient in the methods necessary for
furthering our understanding of the relationships between early brain development and disability in high-risk
populations. She would also become prepared to undertake not only strong experimental work, but also care
for patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities while effectively integrating her research with disability
advocacy. This would pave the way for the applicant to become a successful physician-scientist and child
neurologist creating better outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities."
10857276,"Project Summary
The current breast cancer screening recommendations are essentially a one-size fits all approach and,
therefore, not optimal in terms of effectiveness and resource utilization. This is because the typical approach
focuses on finding subgroups of women who are at “higher than average risk” for developing breast cancer and
aggressively promoting additional imaging techniques. However, most women (approximately 70%) who get
breast cancer do not have any known risk factors. In addition, the majority of women (approximately 88%)
never get breast cancer and these women benefit the least from breast cancer screening. To maximize the
benefit to all women and minimize possible harms, investigators have advocated personalized screening using
a woman's individual breast cancer risk. To do so, it is essential to have a marker that can provide an accurate
near term mammography-detectable breast cancer (mBCa) risk to identify women with very high or very low
near term mBCa risk. The goal of this application is to provide person-centered markers of mBCa risk, thus,
offering a personalized screening strategy. We hypothesize that we can use temporal changes and lateral
differences in images extracted by a novel imaging transformation from sequential mammograms to develop
image-based risk markers that can provide women with an accurate near-term mBCa risk from their last
negative mammography exam. We will build a database (N= 1,200, 400 cases and 800 controls) of sequential
(≥ 5 years) full field digital mammograms collected from the medical records of women over 40 years of age for
development and additional independent validation dataset (N = 600, 200 cases, 400 controls) for validation.
We will develop year-specific risk markers using a novel Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT),
convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional non-imaging markers (such as age). RCDT effectively
compares any two lateral and temporal mammograms and highlights differences between the two without
having to explicitly align the two images. We will use CNN as a robust imaging marker to analyze the resulting
RCDT images from mammograms. Using a statistical approach for handling longitudinal data based on risk
sets, we will combine imaging-based risk markers and conventional non-imaging risk factors to develop two
near-term risk markers, one for accurately predicting very high risk of having mBCa within a few years and
another for predicting very low risk of having mBCa within a few years. High-risk and low-risk markers will be
optimized separately to maximize the sizes of accurately predicted high and low risk groups."
10850869,"PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT
Does what time of day you exercise matter for weight loss? The objective of this proposal is to determine the
effect of an equivalent dose of morning versus evening aerobic exercise on change in body weight, energy intake
(EI), and components of energy expenditure (EE) in adults with overweight or obesity. Nearly two-thirds of US
adults who attempt to lose weight engage in exercise as a strategy for weight loss. However, weight loss from
exercise alone is often substantially less than predicted based on the calories burned in exercise. This is due to
compensatory changes that occur in response to exercise (e.g. increases in EI and decreases in non-exercise
EE) that limit the energy deficit produced by exercise. Thus, strategies that reduce the compensatory response
could enhance the weight loss efficacy of exercise. Preliminary data suggests that morning exercise may limit
development of compensation and thus be superior to evening exercise for weight loss. In a secondary data
analysis of a 10-month supervised exercise intervention in adults with overweight or obesity, individuals who
predominantly exercised in the morning exhibited three-fold greater weight loss compared to individuals who
predominantly exercised in the evening, despite equivalent exercise EE and adherence. Further, 81% of
morning exercisers achieved ≥5% weight loss, compared to 36% of evening exercisers. There was also evidence
of differences in compensation. Despite no intervention on diet, morning exercisers decreased EI across the
intervention, while evening exercisers increased EI. Morning exercisers increased total daily energy expenditure
(TDEE) proportionately to the EE of exercise, while evening exercisers demonstrated attenuated increases in
TDEE. However, these results were from a retrospective analysis in which participants were categorized by the
time of day in which they predominantly performed exercise sessions. A rigorously designed randomized trial is
needed to confirm these novel findings. In the proposed study, adults with overweight or obesity will be
randomized to 7 months of supervised aerobic exercise (2000 kcal/week) performed either in the morning or the
evening, and then followed for an additional 6 months. The central hypothesis is that morning exercise will result
in greater weight loss as compared to evening exercise due to attenuated development of compensatory
changes in EI and EE. The study will compare the effects of morning versus evening exercise on changes in
body weight and body composition (Aim 1), changes in EI and appetite (Aim 2), changes in EE, non-exercise
physical activity, and sedentary time (Aim 3), and changes in meal timing and sleep (Exploratory Aim 4). The
approach is rigorous and innovative as exercise will be prescribed based on EE using indirect calorimetry, free-
living TDEE and EI will be measured objectively (doubly-labeled water), and 24-hr patterns of physical activity,
sedentary time, meal timing, and sleep will be measured to understand pathways through which exercise timing
alters energetics and weight loss. The study is significant as it could identify a practicable strategy to enhance
weight loss from exercise and provide insight on how timing of exercise impacts compensatory behaviors."
10842252,"Abstract
Chronic pain affects 35-40% of people with chronic neurological conditions, including persons with multiple
sclerosis (MS) - an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system affecting approximately 1 million
Americans. Unfortunately, the analgesic effects of conventional treatments for pain in neurological conditions is
limited. Cannabidiol (CBD, derived from cannabis sativa) is a safe, promising complimentary therapy that is
frequently used in combination with Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to treat pain in persons with MS (PwMS).
However, the distinct analgesic mechanisms of CBD - relative to better-studied cannabinoid formulations such
as THC or THC/CBD combinations (which carry abuse potential) - are not well understood, galvanizing the
need for mechanistic research focused on CBD monotherapy. Preliminary data from a nationwide study of
PwMS conducted by the investigators suggest that CBD could independently exert analgesic effects through
improved sleep, particularly among PwMS with nociplastic (centralized) pain. Investigations that now build
upon these early findings could provide novel insight into mechanisms by which CBD induces analgesic
effects, and identify pain phenotypes that are most likely to be responsive to CBD for chronic pain. This
innovative, mechanistic study proposes to apply novel polysomnographic sleep stage analyses that extend
beyond conventional polysomnography (PSG) measures, and new features of sleep macrostructure derived
from in-home actigraphy, to assess aspects of sleep that could play key mechanistic roles in the analgesic
effects of CBD. Our overarching goal is to apply these novel sleep assessment methods, coupled with
validated pain phenotyping techniques, to uncover unique mechanistic associations between CBD, sleep, and
analgesia in PwMS, compared to THC monotherapy, THC/CBD combination therapy, or placebo. Persons with
MS who experience chronic pain will undergo pain phenotyping with validated survey measures of nociplastic
and neuropathic pain, and randomized to CBD (Epidiolex®), THC (dronabinol), THC/CBD combination, or
placebo for 12 weeks. In-lab PSG and 14-day wrist-worn actigraphy will be collected at baseline and 12 weeks’
post-treatment. Changes in sleep microstructure (Aim 1; including sleep stage bout length, sleep stage
transition probability, and entropy) and macrostructure (Aim 2; including sleep regularity, rhythmicity, timing
and duration) will be compared between cannabinoid and placebo groups, and pain phenotype will be
assessed as a predictor of CBD-related changes in sleep. Aim 3 will assess the measures of sleep
microstructure and macrostructure as mediators of analgesic response to CBD. Data generated from this study
will to inform CBD research, across a spectrum of neurological and other chronic conditions, that can be
applied to the development of precision-medicine approaches for chronic pain."
10834194,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL: More people die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than any
other disease worldwide. Our proposal focuses on the biogenesis and catabolism of atherogenic apoB-
containing lipoproteins (apoB-Lps), which are major risk factors for CVD. ApoB-Lps comprise both cholesterol
and triglycerides (TGs). Whereas reducing cholesterol is well established to reduce atherosclerosis, it remains
to be convincingly determined whether decreasing levels of TGs or the apoB-Lps that carry TGs will decrease
CVD. Blocking secretion of apoB-Lps by the liver reduces levels of cholesterol-rich apoB-Lps, such as LDL and
its TG-rich precursor VLDL. Unfortunately, such approaches have led to hepatosteatosis. However, human
genetic mutation and animal studies demonstrate that reduced liver secretion of TGs does not invariably cause
steatosis. By characterizing novel factors and pathways regulating liver apoB-Lp production, intravascular
lipolysis, and adipose TG retention and mobilization, we will identify unique targets to reduce circulating apoB-
Lps, their infiltration into the artery wall, and atherosclerosis. We will define basic mechanisms in cells and in
new rodent models and then correlate our discoveries with human data, emphasizing a translational and
transfomative approach. Our overall goals are to: 1) identify new processes and factors regulating circulating TG
and FA levels, 2) investigate the lipidation and intracellular transport of apoB in hepatocytes, and 3) study how
different apoB-Lps interact with cells and ultimately catalyze atherogenesis. This application comprises three
projects (P1–P3) that have integrated work from three established investigators of apoB-Lp metabolism and
atherosclerosis. P1 will investigate the role of adipose MTP and FIT2 in regulating adipose lipolysis, circulating
lipids, hepatic apoB-Lp production, and atherosclerosis. P2 will study two poorly characterized proteins in the
liver, KLHL12 and FIT2, which control hepatic apoB-Lp lipid-loading and secretion, and the composition of
atherogenic apoB-Lps. P3 will study how TG-rich apoB-Lps interact with the vascular wall, and specifically
determine the role of the N-terminal region of apoB on lipid uptake and transcytosis of apoB-Lps by vascular
ECs and their links to atherosclerosis. The PPG has an administrative core and three scientific cores (C1–C3).
The Administrative Core will oversee the overall PPG function and finances. To assist P1–P3, C1 will provide
biostatistics and bioinformatics support, C2 will perform lipidomics and proteomics on apoB-Lps and tissues and
provide human samples, and C3 will perform state-of-the-art atherosclerosis assays. Our studies will generate
novel mouse models invaluable to understand the factors that regulate lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis,
identify new therapeutic targets, and better define how high circulating levels of atherogenic apoB-Lps and other
factors contribute to atherogenesis. Dissecting pathways that regulate the production and atherogenicity of apoB-
Lps promises to reveal novel approaches to reduce CVD. This requires the integration of reseach in our three
projects, as experiments in each require assistance from the others and core resources."

CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are deployed by prokaryotic organisms to protect them from potential
lethal infection by viruses. As a counter-defense strategy, certain viruses produce anti-CRISPR (ACR) proteins
capable of inactivating CRISPR-mediated, anti-viral immunity. Diverse CRISPR-Cas systems function by
capturing short viral sequences within the CRISPR locus of the host genome and using expressed crRNAs and
associated Cas nucleases for viral recognition and destruction. The identities and functions of viral ACRs in
subverting distinct CRISPR-Cas systems are only just now being revealed. The primary objectives of our
research program are: 1) to understand the molecular basis of mechanisms underlying both host CRISPR-Cas
immune pathways and anti-CRISPR activities of viruses and 2) to exploit knowledge gained to contribute and
improve CRISPR-based applications. Using an established and powerful combination of molecular, genetic,
structural and biochemical approaches, with invaluable contributions from a team of superb collaborators, we
will continue to work to dissect pathways and delineate molecular mechanisms governing diverse CRISPR-Cas
systems. Furthermore, we will gain key insight on ACR-mediated mechanisms used by viruses to thwart
CRISPR immunity. Innovative CRISPR-based tools and technologies are providing transformative advances in
basic and medical research. The knowledge gained by our research will contribute directly to ongoing efforts
aimed at exploiting diverse CRISPR-Cas systems as powerful research tools (e.g. for genome editing and
controlled gene expression, to selectively detect and target human viral and bacterial pathogens, and for
limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance). Moreover, understanding the detailed modes of action of diverse
ACRs is necessary for establishing ACRs as important new research tools for selective and safe utilization of
different CRISPR-based technologies."

Natural product biosynthetic pathways harbor a vast synthetic potential for chemical groups that are rare
in biology. Enzymes that were adapted from primary metabolism to novel functions in these secondary-
metabolite pathways are a major source biocatalytic potential for many applications. In this project, the
structure and function of several enzymes that catalyze unusual reactions in the biosynthesis of natural
products will be investigated. Protein crystal structures will inform the development of functional assays,
which will be used to test structure-based hypotheses about mechanism, substrate selectivity and product
specificity. The enzymes are from bacterial and fungal biosynthetic pathways for several natural product
classes, including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides and azaphilones. The four enzyme systems have
great potential for biocatalyst development within or outside their natural pathways, for advancing our
understanding of protein evolution in nature, for expanding the scope of enzyme chemistry, and for
engineering new function. In the first system, a bacterial enzyme has distinct acyl transfer and
decarboxylation functions in two biosynthetic pathways. The dual functions are represented on widely
separated branches of the larger superfamily; how they are combined in one enzyme will be determined.
In the second system, an enzyme family related to oxidoreductases functions in offloading an amide
product from the carrier protein of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. In the third system, a large family
of fungal flavin-dependent monooxygenases catalyzes hydroxylation reactions on aromatic substrates in
azaphilone and related pathways. The structural basis for the site- and stereo-specificity of selected
family members will be determined in order to develop a panel of biocatalysts for challenging
dearomatization reactions. In the fourth system, the determinants of macrocycle formation and the
possibilities for an expanded substrate scope of five enzymes will be investigated."
10850919,"CANCER BIOLOGY PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) launched a new Cancer Biology
(CB) Program in 2020, incorporating the strengths and expertise of select members from the former Cancer Cell
Signaling and Cancer Molecular Genetics Programs. The objective of this restructuring was to build a more
cohesive, cancer-centric, basic research program within MCC’s transdisciplinary environment that would
enhance collaborative interactions and increase opportunities to seed new scientific concepts. These concepts
could be further leveraged through team-based translation with members of the Developmental Therapeutics
(DT) or Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Programs. CB Program members crafted an overarching scientific
pillar goal through the 2021-2025 MCC Strategic Plan to guide their efforts forward – to achieve groundbreaking
discoveries through unraveling mechanistic paradigms of tumorigenesis and dissecting key interactions between
tumors and their stromal or immune microenvironment. The CB Program is organized under three specific aims
focusing on cancer cell signaling, genetic and epigenetic drivers, and tumor microenvironment. CB Program
members perform innovative research to understand the complex facets of cancer biology and in collaboration
with DT and CPC members develop innovative preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools to target specific
cancers, especially those with the highest burden in MCC’s catchment area. Recently, the CB Program
undertook initiatives to establish formal collaborations with the Office of Community Outreach and Engagement
to ensure its members are fully aware of the distinct characteristics of the cancer burden in MCC’s catchment
area so that they can best align their science to address this burden and engage the community in CB Program
science going forward. With 47 members across six VCU Schools/Colleges, the CB Program has also cultivated
a rich intellectual environment for attracting and mentoring an increasingly diverse pipeline of early-stage cancer
biologists. CB Program members currently hold $7.8M in annual, direct, peer-reviewed funding ($3.1M from NCI;
$3.3M from other NIH institutes; $1.4M from other agencies). Since 2016, members of the CB Program have
published their discoveries in 433 program-relevant and cancer-focused research articles. Demonstrating the
program’s collaborative nature, 141 (33%) publications were intra-programmatic, 132 (30%) were inter-
programmatic, and 266 (61%) were inter-institutional. Among the many scientific contributions made by CB
members since 2016, a few noteworthy include 1) defining the roles of two oncoproteins, AEG-1 and SND1, in
hepatocellular carcinoma; 2) discovering a novel Activin/Twist1 axis in cancer cachexia that is amenable to
therapeutic manipulation; 3) identifying PDZ1i as a potent anti-metastatic drug; 4) unraveling the ability of
sphingosine kinase 1 to inhibit triple-negative breast cancer growth and to suppress chemotherapy-induced
peripheral neuropathy; and 5) explicating the correlation of transcriptomic human signatures, based on murine
tumor-associated macrophages after ablation of Treg cells, with increased survival in human breast cancer."
10850925,"DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY

Program’s overarching goals are to leverage MCC basic and translational science to discover, develop, and
evaluate novel MCC-conceived small molecules and biologics for application in improved strategies for cancer
treatments and to drive MCC’s efforts in leading and participating in national and local clinical trial efforts. Guided
by the 2021-2025 MCC Strategic Plan, 51 members of the DT Program, representing 15 departments and four
VCU Schools/Colleges, lead efforts in drug discovery and development, designing rational drug combination
regimens to overcome therapeutic resistance, and evaluating the very latest and most promising therapeutic
approaches through clinical trials. DT members currently hold $7.1M in annual, direct, peer-reviewed funding
($3.5M from National Cancer Institute (NCI); $1.3M from other National Institutes of Health; $2.2M from other
agencies) and another $1.1M from industry and foundation agencies. Notably, NCI funding has increased by
75% compared to the last Cancer Center Support Grant renewal in 2016. In the current project period, members
have published their scientific results in 410 cancer-focused research articles reporting their discoveries and
observations. Demonstrating the program’s highly collaborative nature, 123 (30%) publications were intra-
programmatic and 154 (38%) were inter-programmatic with scientists in MCC’s Cancer Biology and Cancer
Prevention and Control Programs. In total, 258 (63%) of these publications were in collaboration with other
institutions including other NCI-designated cancer centers, and 64 (16%) were in high-impact (IF>10) biomedical
science journals. Most importantly, members of the DT Program work with the MCC Clinical Trials Office and
the Center’s 14 Disease Working Groups in conjunction with the Protocol Review and Monitoring System to
initiate, execute, and monitor clinical trials. In 2021, there were 153 interventional treatment trials for adult and
pediatric patients actively accruing (15 investigator-initiated, 91 National Clinical Trials Network, 11 Experimental
Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN), and 36 industry-initiated). Since 2016, MCC clinical investigators
have enrolled 1,000 patients to treatment trials. Importantly, as one of 14 Minority/Underserved NCI Community
Oncology Research Program designated institutions, the DT Program largely contributes to MCC’s high
enrollment of minorities (34%) onto treatment trials. The MCC was also invited to join the ETCTN through the
Princess Margaret Cancer Center’s Lead Academic Organization in 2016, as a result of its demonstrated
capabilities to develop and perform early phase trials. Another important initiative within the DT Program this
project period has been the 2018 launch of a Molecules to Medicine (M2M) initiative. With significant MCC
leadership facilitation and investment there are more than a dozen efforts to translate novel agents discovered
and/or developed by MCC members across the translational continuum – from target identification/validation all
the way through the preparatory stages for early phase trials."
10850928,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) first introduced its Cancer
Prevention and Control (CPC) Program within the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) in 1991. The CPC
Program has matured into a highly multidisciplinary nexus of investigators, including population health as well
as clinical and basic scientists, and the program continues its emphasis on identifying and mitigating cancer
risks. However, since the last CCSG renewal, the CPC Program has recruited multiple new experts in
survivorship research, further expanding its impact across the cancer care continuum. The Program is highly
focused on addressing MCC’s and the community’s priority disease concerns – lung, gastrointestinal, breast,
and prostate cancers – as well as two lifestyles or behaviors significantly driving the cancer burden (tobacco
control and obesity prevention). CPC research aligns well with the MCC’s Community-to-Bench framework and
its mission, goals, and strategic plans, and the program leads Center efforts actively engaging the community in
research. Furthermore, the Center-wide emphasis on reducing disparities is exemplified by many CPC members’
efforts to understand and address inequities among racial/ethnic as well as rural/urban communities, and notably
where the two intersect. For instance, within MCC’s catchment area, it is the rural Virginia communities with
majority-minority populations of Blacks/African Americans being reported among the nation’s cancer hot spots.
Led by Oxana G. Palesh, PhD and Victoria J. Findley PhD, the CPC Program comprises 44 scientists
representing 12 departments across the Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, and the College of Humanities and
Science. The program has $6.8M in annual, direct, peer-reviewed funding ($2.5M from NCI, $3.1M from other
NIH institutes; and $1.2 from other agencies). In the current project period, CPC members authored 337 cancer-
focused research publications reflecting the highly collaborative nature of these scientists; 125 (37%) were intra-
programmatic, 46 (14%) were inter-programmatic, 233 (69%) were inter-institutional with 161 (48%) being
collaborations with other NCI-designated cancer centers. In addition, the CPC Program has tripled the number
of multi-Principal Investigator (MPI) and multi-project awards during the current project period. Their portfolio
now includes 16 MPI R01/R21s, two U01s, one UG1, one U54, two P20s, and a Stand Up to Cancer award. The
CPC Program also has a growing portfolio of clinic- and community-based interventional studies addressing
disparities, supportive care needs, and survivorship, and investigators and since 2016 have enrolled 1,663
individuals to interventional studies and over 18,000 to non-interventional studies. During the next CCSG project
period, the CPC Program will continue to anchor its efforts around community-based and community-engaged
research to identify and decrease cancer risks, increase cancer screening, and reduce disparate cancer

The Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center (MCC) is nationally recognized for engaging the
communities it serves in research addressing cancer disparities, facilitating access to high-quality cancer
screening and treatment, providing education on best cancer prevention practices, and advancing public policy
changes that reduce the cancer burden in Virginia and beyond. The MCC catchment area includes 66 contiguous
localities (47 counties and 19 independent cities) in central, southern, and eastern Virginia across urban and
rural settings with diverse and underserved populations. Vanessa B. Sheppard, PhD, Associate Director for
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), directs an Office of COE to 1) connect catchment-area
communities to cancer risk education, screening, and treatment; 2) cultivate interest among MCC investigators
across basic, clinical, translational, and population sciences to conduct research addressing catchment-area
burden, disparities, and community priorities; 3) establish a formal process by which community members inform
research activities; 4) collaborate with the MCC Clinical Trials Office to improve accruals of individuals
underrepresented in research; and 5) promote local, state, and national policies that impact cancer prevention,
care delivery, and cancer control. Based on community data and input that played a significant role in framing
the MCC 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, research and COE priorities include cancer disparities; survivorship;
prevention, early detection, and treatment for lung, gastrointestinal, breast, and prostate cancers; and
implementing impactful behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk (e.g., tobacco control and obesity
reduction). To assess the impact of COE efforts, the Office of COE uses a logic model with short-term (e.g.,
expand reach, enhance services, augment collaborations) and long-term metrics (e.g., decrease cancer burden,
increase cancer health equity). Future plans include 1) partnering with Statistical Analysis System to augment
the COE’s current capabilities to report comprehensive data for monitoring the catchment-area cancer risk and
burden; 2) strengthening COE communication channels through bidirectional information flow and participation
between the community and MCC investigators to build robust trust that allows for mutual decision making,
leading to better health outcomes; 3) expanding COE education, screening, and clinical research participation
initiatives tailored for racial/ethnic minority and other potentially underserved populations (e.g., elderly,
LGBTQ+); 4) building on relationships with the Eastern Virginia Medical School and two Historically Black
Universities (Norfolk State University and Hampton University) to launch targeted COE initiatives in the coastal
Hampton Roads area; and 5) deploying new mobile units to extend COE’s reach in rural communities throughout
the catchment area."
10843120,"Abstract Community Outreach and Engagement
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) activities of COHCCC are led from the Center of Community
Alliance for Research & Education (CCARE), which was created in 2006 in response to Catchment Area cancer
burden and health disparities. COHCCC‘s overall goal is to enhance COE impact by fully integrating and
amplifying community outreach and engagement throughout the COHCCC and its Catchment Area. Our
Catchment Area encompasses the Southern California counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San
Bernardino totaling 18 million Californians who are among the most ethnically diverse population in our nation.
The COE team facilitates community-scientist-clinician collaborations for community engagement in cancer
prevention and COHCCC research. COE’s work is informed by population-level data and our community health
needs assessments and by guidance from our multiethnic Community Advisory Board (representing the four
counties of our Catchment Area) and by the COHCCC Director and Leaders. During this cycle, COHCCC heavily
invested in COE, creating a robust COE team that includes four new staff, four faculty affiliates, and twelve
Faculty Champions.
Highlighted COHCCC COE accomplishments: Expanded and deepen ties with community partners (CAB)
towards reducing Catchment Area cancer burden and disparities targeting two key priority areas: common
cancers (colorectal, breast, lung, prostate), and preventable cancers (cervical). We also prioritize unique cancers
with disparities (liver, myeloma). COE facilitated Catchment Area responsive research in all five COHCCC
Programs (see Table 5). COE championed minority accrual efforts within the Clinical Trials Office, contributed
to our diversity strategy (PED), and informed training and education (CRTEC) diversity workshops. Using a
“Train-the-Trainer” approach, the COE team led 78 workshops training >550 advocates, clinicians, and
navigators to increase community cancer prevention (e.g., smoking cessation) and screening and trained 105
multiethnic navigators to improve community research awareness and participation in clinical studies.
COE Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Identify and attend to cancer burden, risk factors, societal determinants of health,
and community health needs within the COHCCC Catchment Area. Aim 2. Build capacity for community driven
cancer prevention/control and implement community responsive interventions and screening to reduce cancer
burden across the lifespan. Aim 3. Mobilize COHCCC Catchment Area and equity focused research. Aim 4.
Expand policy engagement on access to care and clinical studies within and beyond our Catchment Area. For
the next cycle, these reach of these aims will be expanded using communication and digital technology and
through implementation and team science approaches for greater community reach and service to reduce
Catchment Area cancer burden and disparities."
10843124,"Abstract Developmental Funds (DF)
The overall goal of the Developmental Funds of the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC) is
to stimulate innovative early-stage research that addresses cancer prevention, diagnostics, treatment or health
disparities. Developmental Funds awards provide COHCCC investigators with seed money for generating
preliminary data and/or support for multi-project grant applications, enabling them to successfully apply for
independent peer-reviewed funding. Developmental Funds also support clinical Early-Stage Investigators (ESI)
by granting them additional protected time for developing their first NCI grant or investigator-initiated clinical trial.
We foster diversity in our research teams by specifically providing pilot awards to investigators from groups that
are underrepresented in biomedical research. We also aspire to improve diversity of the patients enrolled in our
clinical trials by supporting clinical ESI for developing trials that will increase accrual of patient URGs and/or to
be conducted at our clinical network sites. In addition to mechanism-specific eligibility, awards prioritize inter-
program and multi-disciplinary collaborations, as well as alignment with COHCCC strategic priorities.
Developmental Funds stimulate the production of high-quality research proposals via the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. Support innovative pilot projects from diverse investigators and multi-disciplinary teams
 Aim 2. Provide protected research time for early-career physician scientists with Clinical ESI Awards
Dr. Larry Kwak, as COHCCC Deputy Director, oversees Developmental Funds, providing strategic direction and
overall leadership and ensuring that Developmental Funds activities leverage opportunities across the COH
enterprise. While Dr. Kwak oversees the scientific aspects of Developmental Funds, the Associate Director of
Administration, Ashley Baker Lee, is responsible for managing the awards in keeping with NCI guidelines and
best practices, including announcements, scientific review facilitation, pre/post award management and impact
metrics through the COHCCC Administration. The scientific merit and mission alignment of award applications
will be evaluated by the Scientific Review Committee, with standing members consisting of Drs. Kwak and
Rosen, a biostatistician, one member from each COHCCC Program, and at least one basic, one translational
and one clinical scientist. Funding decisions will be made by majority vote and ranking of proposals, with
borderline cases decided by Drs. Rosen and Kwak.
In the current funding cycle (2017-2021), CCSG funds supported the development of a new SR, now a full SR,
known as the Population-Facing Research Shared Resource (PFR-SR) that is widely used by Cancer Center
members. PFR-SR facilitated 21 NIH grants (7 multi-PI) and PFR-SR services generated 36 publications.
COHCCC also distributed 4 Team Science Awards that resulted in the submission of 2 NCI SPORE and 2 NCI
Program Project applications as well as separate R01s for many of the individual projects. Four R01 grants have
been awarded with a return on investment of 20-fold thus far."
10841484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A central goal in HIV/AIDS cure research is preventing or delaying viral rebound following analytical treatment
interruption (ATI). It is widely assumed that understanding the viral and host factors involved in in vivo latency
reactivation would lead to new, more rational cure strategies; however, the biology and provenance of the
rebounding virus remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to leverage four recent discoveries from our
groups to gain insight into the mechanisms of HIV-1 recrudescence. Using “gold standard” sampling methods
to characterize the latent reservoir before and after treatment interruption (ATI), we discovered that viral isolates
derived by quantitative virus outgrowth (QVOA) do not represent or predict the viruses that emerge in the plasma
following treatment interruption (1, 2). We also found that rebound viruses, but not QVOA-derived reservoir
viruses, were highly resistant to type 1 interferons (IFN-I), indicating potent host innate responses at the site of
viral recrudescence (3). Surprisingly, some, but not all, rebound
suggesting
isolates replicated to high titers in macrophages,
 a greater biological diversity than previously known. Finally, we discovered that IFN-I resistant
rebound viruses have the ability to reseed the reservoir, raising the possibility of long-term clinical consequences
of ATI (2, 3). In this application, we will leverage these discoveries to elucidate the viral and host factors
that govern HIV-1 rebound. Our hypothesis is that by (i) determining the universality, kinetics and clinical
impact of IFN-I resistance during rebound, (ii) defining the viral determinants of IFN-I resistance and the host
interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that place pressure on the rebounding virus, and (iii) tracing the provenance
of IFN-I resistant rebound viruses, we will uncover key mechanisms that control HIV-1 reactivation from latency.
In Aim 1, we will expand our studies to more diverse ATI trial participants, including women, minorities, acute
and early ART initiators and individuals receiving IFN-I modulating therapies, to assess the generality of the
IFN-I resistant phenotype of rebound viruses. We will also test to what extent IFN-I resistance persists during
prolonged ATI and determine how this influences the rates of IFN-I resistant viruses that reseed the reservoir. In
Aim 2, we will elucidate the biological properties of rebound HIV-1, map the viral determinants of IFN-I resistance,
and identify the host interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that place pressure on the recrudescing virus. In Aim 3,
we will trace the provenance of rebound virus by testing blood, thoracic duct lymph and lymphatic tissue using
regular and modified QVOAs, examine whether long-lived myeloid cells, including brain macrophages and
microglia, serve as reservoirs of IFN-I resistant viruses, and explore whether SHIV-infected rhesus macaques
recapitulate the IFN-I phenotypes of HIV-1 reservoir and rebound viruses. We expect these studies to improve
our understanding of the clinically relevant, rebound competent HIV-1 reservoir, the mechanisms underlying in
vivo viral reactivation and the host factors that place pressure on the rebounding virus pool, which should lead
to more rational and effective HIV/AIDS cure strategies.

10846856,"The coordination of cellular function with the environment is essential for adaptation and survival. Dynamic
nutrient environments are ubiquitous throughout nature and include competitive growth environments of
proliferating microorganisms and tissue niches in multicellular organisms. Failure to adapt can lead to cell death,
developmental defects, and disease.
 Adaptive cellular responses are often achieved by rapid inducible changes in gene expression programs.
An ideal mechanism to achieve this is through modification of chromatin. Despite this knowledge, the
mechanisms by which chromatin modification contributes to metabolic plasticity remain largely unexplored. As
such, many broad biological questions remain unanswered: How do metabolic signaling pathways communicate
with chromatin to regulate gene expression? How does the metabolic environment modify chromatin to facilitate
adaptive gene expression and coordinate cell division? How do chromatin modifications influence energy
metabolism plasticity during developmental programming? How is metabolic memory propagated?
 Our proposed research is significant because it will establish chromatin modifiers as necessary
components of metabolic homeostasis, and serve as a platform to investigate epigenetic alterations and
metabolic dysfunction in developmental abnormalities and disease states. Our broad research goal is to define
the chromatin modification events that coordinate metabolic plasticity and are central to adaptive cellular
responses. Our central hypothesis is that chromatin modifiers link nutrient sensing pathways to
metabolic gene regulation required for proper fitness, proliferation, and development. We plan to
investigate this hypothesis using innovative approaches that include metabolic-synchronization, as well as
single-cell chromatin and metabolic profiling. We are ideally suited to carry out these studies, as our research
was the first to demonstrate that a chromatin remodeling complex functions downstream of metabolic signaling
pathways to regulate coordinate metabolism with cell division and developmental timing.
 Through achievement of our research goals we expect the following outcomes: Comprehensive
determination of histone modifications that are in tune with energy metabolism pathways; determination of the
relationship between nutrient sensing pathways and chromatin; characterization of the tissue-specific metabolic
requirements during development; identification of novel chromatin-mediated mechanisms for metabolic memory
and diversification. These investigations will greatly enhance our knowledge of metabolic plasticity mechanisms
and how they contribute to cellular and organismal viability, development and disease."
10846652,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multicellular organisms develop receptor-mediated signal transduction initiated by extracellular growth factors to
proliferate. Insulin has long been known as a growth factor, and hyperinsulinemia can promote and sustain tumor
growth. Insulin receptor (IR) localizes to the cell surface plasma membrane both in metabolic tissue cells and in
highly proliferative cells such as immune cells and cancer cells. IR activates two downstream signaling pathways,
the PI3K-AKT pathway and the MAPK pathway, to regulate cell metabolism, proliferation, and growth. Despite
intriguing findings for IR signaling in systemic homeostasis, how the nutrient signaling maintains chromosome
stability still remains uncertain. This gap in our knowledge presents a key barrier to our understanding of the
function of insulin in cell proliferation and differentiation and its impact on human health, as hyperinsulinemia is
associated with various diseases including type 2 diabetes and cancer. The key spindle checkpoint protein MAD2
forms a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) and ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Our recent
studies showed that MAD2 binds to IR, recruits the clathrin adaptor complex by assembling an MCC-like complex,
and promotes IR endocytosis. In our unpublished results, we found that disruption of IR-MAD2 interaction in
mice increases aneuploidy in the immune cells and promotes T-cell lymphoma. These results suggest that the
spindle checkpoint regulators and IR mutually regulate each other in both mitosis and IR signaling. IR and insulin-
like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) are highly homologous receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). IGF1R does not
bind to MAD2, and its endocytosis mechanism and signaling outcomes are different from that of IR. We recently
defined the distinct activation mechanisms of IR and IGF1R, suggesting that ligand-specific induced structural
differences might affect the endocytosis and downstream signaling of RTKs. In parallel to our studies on the role
of spindle checkpoint proteins in IR signaling, we have also performed unbiased, systematic genome-wide loss
of function studies using CRISPR-Cas9. We identified novel genes that increase or decrease the levels of surface
IR and IR signaling. Here, we propose to combine approaches in mouse genetics, cell biology, biochemistry,
genomics and cryo-EM to determine the function of IR in mitosis, as well as activation mechanisms of IR signaling
for cell proliferation vs. metabolism. Our goals over the next five years are to explore the following questions: (1)
how does IR ensure accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis, and what is the physiological function for IR
in cell division; (2) how does IR selectively activate the PI3K-AKT vs. MAPK signaling branch; and (3) what other
factors are required for IR function in cell proliferation and differentiation? Collectively, the proposed research
will advance our understanding of the function, regulation, and mechanism(s) of insulin action in physiological
cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, our studies will likely serve as a basis for further translational
research and future therapeutics as hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased risks
for certain cancers and may also be harnessed for cancer immunotherapies."
10852890,"Project Summary
Children and adolescents increasingly experience insufficient or poorly timed sleep as early school start times
collide with maturational changes in sleep regulation. However, we lack a deep understanding of both the
brain-behavior consequences of this sleep loss and the factors that distinguish which children may be
increasingly vulnerable and which are comparatively resilient to its effects. This is particularly salient for the
brain-behavior mechanisms underlying attention and impulsivity: two cognitive domains which are acutely
impacted by sleep loss, are critical for academic success, and are core aspects of neurodevelopmental
disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD). Attempts to address these issues are
hindered by limited mechanistic studies, overreliance on data from adults, and the use of neurotypical samples
only. Thus, this R01 project tackles these challenges with a within-subject at-home sleep restriction experiment
with combined methods of fMRI, neurocognitive testing, EEG, and circadian physiology to bear on this
important problem. We aim to enroll (over five years) 150, 10-13-year-old children across levels of inattention
and impulsivity. We will compare a sleep optimized baseline to 5 nights of sleep restriction. Each child is
characterized on several attention and impulsivity metrics to compile baseline risk scores for each domain.
Resting neural arousal (waking frontal EEG theta power) and circadian timing (melatonin onset phase angle)
index sleep-relevant physiology as candidate mechanisms altering a child’s resilience to sleep loss. Repeated
functional magnetic resonance imaging using task-based and resting paradigms, with complex modeling of
behavior variability characterizes sleep loss’s impact on attention and impulsivity. A performance battery
indexes neurocognitive impairments relevant for academic achievement. Finally, machine learning is used to
determine examine distinct phenotypes of baseline risk factors and sleep-loss vulnerability in our sample. In
sum, this project will advance both NICHD and NIMH’s goal to understand mechanisms of complex behavior;
here, consequences and mediators of sleep loss for children."

In this renewal application of an established (47 years), successful multidisciplinary training program in Digestive
Diseases, we will continue to train qualified postdoctoral individuals (M.D., and/or Ph.D.) for academic careers
in digestive diseases. Our interdisciplinary, full time faculty of 40 scientists supports two tracks for potential
trainees: i) basic/disease-oriented research; and ii) patient-oriented research. The basic/disease-oriented track
remains one of long-standing excellence with training opportunities in mucosal immunology, cell biology, enteric
neurosciences, liver pathobiology, and new opportunities organized around regenerative medicine/stem cells,
transcription/epigenetics, microbiome and artificial intelligence and informatics. Training in this track is strongly
supported through interactions with the NIH funded Mayo Comprehensive Cancer Center, Basic Science
Departments at Mayo Clinic, and the NIH P30 Digestive Disease Center grant. The patient-oriented track, which
is educationally buttressed through the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS),
maintains training opportunities in biomedical ethics, clinical innovation and entrepreneurship, clinical trials,
individualized medicine, and quantitative research methods. Additional concentrations in artificial intelligence,
geroscience, health disparities and community engagement and health policy are forthcoming, as new areas of
institutional focus. We continue to request support for 5 postdoctoral trainees/year that are selected through
objective and consensus-driven mechanisms from a talented annual pool of approximately 100 M.D., Ph.D., or
M.D./Ph.D. candidates derived from a variety of clinical and basic disciplines. The overall success of the program
continues to be outstanding with 88% of trainees from the most recently completed 10-year cohort (n=26)
entering into a research intensive/related positions and a funding portfolio from this cohort that includes 15 new
federal grants (8 K series, 2 R series, 5 P30 pilots). Understanding the positive impact of diversity on the training
environment and outcomes, we are currently experiencing our most diverse chapter in our history. Over the
current reporting period 50% of the trainees are women and 19% of appointments were filled with applicants of
Diverse Backgrounds. Institutional support also continues to be strong and well documented. Thus, this highly
established training program remains creative, innovative, and dynamic, thereby continuing to be highly
successful in achieving its goal of training individuals for academic careers in gastroenterology and hepatology."
10839782,"HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) 160 belongs to class I fusion proteins that are also expressed by other
highly pathogenic human viruses including influenza A viruses (IAV), Ebola viruses (EBOV), and coronaviruses
(CoV) such as SARS-CoV (SARS1), MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2). They build spikes on the viral
envelope that induce fusion of viral and cellular membranes to allow viruses to enter cells, which is essential to
the viral infection. Class I fusion proteins are synthesized as a type I transmembrane (TM) polypeptide
precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and delivered to the Golgi apparatus for maturation. The
Golgi contains glycosidases/glycosyltransferases for glycosylation and conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG)
complex and other associated proteins such as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor
(SNARE) proteins for trafficking. Inside the Golgi, high-mannose-type N-glycans are processed into complex-
type and hybrid-type N-glycans after extensive mannose-trimming, and O-glycosylation also occurs. These
precursors except for SARS1-spike (S) are further subjected to proteolytic cleavage by furin to complete the
maturation process. When these steps are disrupted in the Golgi, no infectious particles are produced, leading
to complete inhibition of viral infection. Recently, we and others reported that MARCH8, a member of the
membrane-associated RING-CH-type E3 ubiquitin ligase family, broadly inhibits viral replication by targeting
a wide range of fusion proteins. Importantly, we reported that MARC causes multiple defects in class I
H8
fusion maturation in the Golgi via an unknown mechanism. These defects are found not only in furin-cleavage
of HIV-1 gp160, IAV-hemagglutinin (HA), EBOV-glycoprotein (GP), MERS-S, and SARS2-S, but also in N- and
O-glycosylation of SARS2-S, MERS-S, and EBOV-GP in the Golgi. Although MARCH8 does not trigger the
degradation of these fusion proteins, its E3 ligase function is still required for causing these defects. The goal of
this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of these multiple defects in HIV-1 gp160 maturation
by understanding the MARCH8 antiviral mechanism. We hypothesize that MARCH8 targets glycosidases,
glycosyltransferases, furin, COG complex, and/or SNARE to block HIV-1 gp160 maturation. We propose
two distinct but inter-related Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize how MARCH8
blocks gp160 maturation during HIV-1 infection. Experiments will be performed in primary cells and human
T cell lines in combination with RNA silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout to elucidate the MARCH8 anti-
HIV activity. In Aim 2, we will identify the MARCH8 targets that play a critical role in HIV-1 gp160 maturation.
We will focus on 18 Golgi proteins selected by high confidence bioinformatic analysis to identify the targets. The
significance of this project is very high, which will not only fill in gaps in our understanding of class I fusion
protein glycosylation and trafficking in the Golgi, but also elucidate a novel antiviral mechanism that can be
broadly applied to several highly pathogenic human viruses including HIV-1, SARS2, EBOV, and IAV."

This proposal describes plans to continue a rigorous chemistry-biology interface (CBI) predoctoral training
program that is student-centered and designed to provide trainees with core and cross training in chemistry and
biological sciences, various abilities to push the frontier of biomedical research at the chemistry-biology interface,
and the skills and awareness for diverse career paths. The program, which has been continuously funded by the
NIH since 1996, also promotes interdisciplinary collaborative research across the Cornell campus. We request
funds to support 10 predoctoral trainees. Each trainee will carry out his or her doctoral thesis research with one
or more of 30 faculty mentors affiliated with seven participating units: Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Biological
and Biomedical Sciences, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Microbiology and Immunology, Biochemistry
and Molecular Cell Biology, Plant Biology, and Nutritional Sciences. Participating faculty have well-funded
research programs in chemistry with strong connections to biology or vice versa. Students undergo training in
areas that are broadly distributed over chemistry (synthetic organic, bioorganic, bioinorganic, biophysical, natural
products, X-ray crystallography, metabolomics, and proteomics) and biology (protein structure and function,
enzymology, immunology, signal transduction, chemotaxis, cell biology, host/pathogen interactions, and
genomics). The CBI program continues to successfully merge the cultures of chemistry and biology with effective
didactic and programmatic initiatives, including the adaptation of evidence-based training strategies and mentor
training. CBI trainees take a core set of rigorous courses in both chemistry and biology and undergo responsible
conduct of research training as well as rigor and reproducibility training. Trainees attend seminars in their core
disciplines, participate together with faculty in a CBI seminar program, and organize an annual CBI symposium
that features speakers from diverse career sectors. In addition to research training, our CBI training program
puts career awareness and transferable skills training front and center. We design our career awareness and
transferable skills workshops to address gaps between career skills needed and skills developed in PhD training
that are reported in the literature and obtained through large-scale surveys. We require a sabbatical internship
(or employer site visits in special cases) to allow trainees to explore different career options first-hand. These
career training activities are designed based on the eight principles of experiential learning. The CBI training
activities are accessible to students who are not financially supported by the CBI program and thus have a larger
impact on Cornell campus. The program continues to produce a high-caliber cohort of trainees, who are
increasingly more diverse due to our continued recruitment efforts, with strong publication records and career
outcomes without increasing the time to degree."
10871807,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Membrane proteins are involved in many cellular processes and thus are critical drug targets for a wide range
of diseases. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how the global changes to the lipid
environment affect local membrane protein structure and function. Mounting evidence indicates that lipids can
be essential for membrane protein function, but it is difficult to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying
protein-lipid interactions. The primary challenge is that conventional structural biology tools and binding assays
are poorly suited to characterizing transient and heterogeneous protein-lipid interactions.
 To advance our understanding of biological process and lay a foundation for advancing disease treatment,
our goal is to develop new approaches to determine how lipid bilayers regulate membrane proteins. Studying a
diverse set of membrane protein targets ranging from bacterial complexes to viral ion channels to human
transporters, we are focused on answering several key questions.
 First, which lipids bind a given membrane protein target? Lipids are often observed in membrane protein
structures, but it can be challenging to determine the identity of the lipids present in the local lipidome surrounding
membrane proteins. We will use novel lipidomic lipid exchange-mass spectrometry methods to study enrichment
of specific lipid species in nanodisc lipoprotein particles containing the membrane protein target. Our goal is to
identify unknown lipids that bind the membrane protein targets in complex mixtures of natural lipids.
 Second, how and were do lipids interact with the protein? We know that lipids can be critical for membrane
protein function, but it is often unclear where and how specifically they bind. We will develop new native mass
spectrometry methods to determine the sites and selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein targets. Our
goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving lipid specificity at specific binding sites.
 Finally, why are lipids important for membrane protein function? We know that bunk cellular lipids are
modulated in response to disease, age, and the environment, but it is unclear how these global lipid changes
affect local membrane protein physiology. We will study the function of membrane protein targets in different
lipid environments and with different mutants that affect lipid binding. For lipid sites that significantly affect
function, we will perform structural analysis to connect lipid binding at specific sites with functional outcomes.
 Our overarching goal is to understand how global lipidomic changes affect local membrane protein structure
and function. This will impact biomedical research by identifying lipids important for maintaining protein activity
and aiding in elucidating the physiological mechanisms of membrane proteins inside natural bilayers. Ultimately,
an improved understanding of protein-lipid interactions holds the potential for improved drug discovery and for
new therapeutic strategies for modulating membrane protein activity by modulating cellular lipids."

The Scripps Research Translational Institute (SRTI) is the foundation for the Scripps hub and is dedicated to
accelerating science that will improve human health. SRTI’s emphasis on genomics, digital medicine, and
informatics/analytics fosters a multi-dimensional understanding of individualized human health. The Scripps hub
has previously included the Scripps Research Institute (SR) and Scripps Health (SH) as principal partners,
including Rady Children’s Institute of Genomic Medicine (RCIGM) for genomic medicine initiatives and California
Institute for Medical Research (Calibr) for drug repurposing / discovery. In the new CTSA cycle, our partners
have expanded to include San Diego State University (SDSU), enabling us to combine forces in computer
science, artificial intelligence, biosensors, and diversity inclusion and equity initatives.
SRTI’s expertise in genomics was highlighted during the pandemic. We became one of the country’s most
productive sequencing centers for SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly forming the “SEARCH” alliance to process samples
with the San Diego County Department of Health, UCSD, Sharp Health, California Department of Public Health,
Helix, and our partners RCIGM and SH.
Digital medicine has been one of SRTI’s core strengths, having pioneered the first remote, site-less digital clinical
trial and now expanding this methodology to address many other medical conditions such as health during
pregnancy and sleep disorders. Our Digital Trials Center launched the Digital Engagement & Tracking for Early
Control and Treatment Scripps (DETECT) study, and in a matter of weeks our team was able to accurately
predict the likelihood of Covid with SARS-CoV-2 using passively collected resting heart rate data from wristband
sensors and later to identify a physiologic signature that correlates with Long Covid (Post-Acute Sequelae or
SARS-CoV-2 Infection).
The Scripps hub will innovate clinical and translational science to improve human health across the lifespan and
diverse racial, ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic communities. The hub will provide a nurturing environment
for education, training, and career development with a focus on individualized health domains of genomics, digital
medicine, and biomedical informatics, to empower tomorrow’s diverse workforce."

scientists who have the aptitude to utilize clinical experience in developing biomedical hypotheses that
integrate the research skills learned in our program. We intend to have all trainees independent, productive
and rewarding physician-scientist careers. This program has established 6 objectives that include; 1) dual-
degree completion rates at >97% with an appropriate time-to-degree (7.3 yrs on avg.), 2) the integration of
research and clinical activities, 3) nurture a broad understanding of biomedical disciplines, 4) foster and
encourage the development of good scientific premise, rigorous-research design, strong experimental methods
with reproducibility/validation, as well as skills to analyze and interpret results/outcomes amid ethics and
integrity, 5) build proficiency in initiating, conducting, interpreting, and presenting rigorous and reproducible
biomedical research with increasing self-direction, while strengthen skills to teach and communicate, and 6)
fortify diversity while advancing the knowledge, professional skills, and experiences required to identify and
transition into productive careers in the biomedical research workforce that utilize the dual-degree training.
UACOM-T MD-PhD Program offers a wide range of biomedical disciplines for trainees with 13 graduate
programs available and over 60 faculty trained and excited to be mentors.
 Our rationale for an NIH-MSTP is the desperate need for the increase in Physician-Scientists in the
state of AZ; a population that is rapidly growing and aging with multiple medical and research needs. AZ is the
fourth most populous state for Hispanics and has the third largest Native American population in the US.
UArizona is designated as both a Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native Serving Institution.
UArizona has a strong understanding of the concerns of diverse individuals with behavioral health needs,
excels in cultural competency, and has long recognized its unique mission and obligation to serve all of the
diverse peoples and communities. UArizona has more than doubled its enrollment of URMs in the last 10
years, comprising 20% of all graduate students, placing UArizona at the top of all Research I, AAU-member
institutions. Hence, the UA COM-T is a perfect institution to serve and uphold the goals and intentions of the
MSTP by increasing the number of URMs as physician scientist. The current MD-PhD program has been
funded entirely by support from the institution resulting in a small but overall very successful cohort of
physician scientists with past trainees in academic positions at Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Vanderbilt, Baylor,
OHSU, Scrips, etc. Our program has established a comprehensive 7-year training plan that reduces
unnecessary redundancies, utilizes evidence based medicine training, integrates clinical and research over all

10837779,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In all sensory systems, peripheral sensory organ damage leads to compensatory cortical plasticity that supports
a remarkable recovery of perceptual capabilities. In the auditory system, while auditory nerve input to the
brainstem is significantly reduced after cochlear damage, sound-evoked cortical activity is maintained or even
enhanced. This recovery is due to increased cortical sensitivity (gain) to the spared auditory input. Although this
plasticity does not support features of sound processing encoded by the precise timing of neuronal firing, such
as complex sound discrimination, it provides a remarkable recovery of sound detection. A major gap in
knowledge is the lack of a precise mechanism that explains how this plasticity is implemented and distributed
over the diverse excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, synapses and circuits. Here we propose a strategic,
cooperative, time-dependent, cell type- and synapse-specific plasticity program that restores cortical sound
processing. The results from our studies will advance the field to a new level of understanding regarding cortical
plasticity after peripheral organ damage, and will inspire the development of well-timed, cell-specific treatments
and rehabilitative paradigms and cures that may further enhance the recovery of perception after hearing loss,
and mitigate the development of brain plasticity-related disorders, such as hyperacusis and tinnitus.
Cortical principal neurons (PN) and interneurons (IN) are very diverse and thus capable of supporting a
coordinated and collaborative plan for achieving cortical recovery. The major classes of cortical neurons include
vasoactive intestinal-peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) expressing IN sub-classes, as
well as intratelencephalic (IT), layer (L) 5 pyramidal tract (PT), and L6 corticothalamic (CT) PNs. Based on our
preliminary results, we propose that: 1) PVs are the network “stabilizers”; 2) VIPs are the “enablers” that regulate
SOM activity; and 3) SOMs are the “modulators” that allow for high PN gain. At the cellular and synaptic level,
we propose that soon after cochlear damage: 4) PVs and PTs exhibit a decrease in intrinsic excitability; 5) CTs
exhibit an increase in intrinsic excitability; and 6) thalamic synaptic input to deep cortical layers is shifted from
CT/PT equivalent to CT dominant. Overall, our proposed research and hypotheses provide an experimental
platform to probe how multiple cortical neuronal sub-classes restore cortical processing after peripheral input
loss (Aims 1 and 3). In combination with Aims 2 and 3, our proposed studies will determine the underlying intrinsic
(Aim 2) and synaptic mechanisms (Aim 3) that mediate this plasticity."

Introduction. Acanthamoeba keratitis is a blinding corneal infection with few treatment options. Corticosteroids
are currently used by many cornea specialists for acanthamoeba keratitis, but their use is controversial given
their ability to promote acanthamoeba growth.
Trial Design. This proposed study is a randomized trial assessing whether topical corticosteroids improve
clinical and visual outcomes.
 • Inclusion. 200 patients with microbiologic evidence of acanthamoeba keratitis (i.e., on culture, smear,
 or polymerase chain reaction) from 11 centers in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and India
 will be eligible if there is evidence of ocular inflammation after 4 weeks of anti-amoebic therapy.
 • Pre-trial intervention. All participants will be treated with a standard of care anti-amoebic treatment,
 with the preferred treatment being polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02% eyedrops.
 • Trial intervention. After the fourth week of anti-amoebic treatment, if there is ocular inflammation (i.e.,
 corneal, episcleral, or anterior chamber inflammation) then participants will be offered enrollment and
 randomized to either topical prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% or placebo eyedrops. Participants will
 continue PHMB therapy while on the study medications.
 • Trial outcomes. The primary outcome is best corrected visual acuity with a hard contact lens,
 assessed at months 6 and 7. Secondary outcomes include (i) time to clinical resolution, (ii) time to
 perforation or therapeutic corneal transplantation, (iii) corneal thinning, (iv) eye pain, and (v) quality of
life.
Secondary objectives. Corneal swabs will be collected at the time of the initial diagnosis and processed with
metagenomic deep sequencing to determine if endosymbiotic bacteria living within the amoeba, or the
organism’s gene expression profile, is predictive of severe inflammation. Conjunctival swabs will be collected
prior to randomization to determine if the host gene expression profile is predictive of severe inflammation.
Impact. The trial will provide much-needed evidence using the highest-quality study design: a randomized
controlled trial. Moreover, this will be the largest prospective cohort of acanthamoeba keratitis to date, with
extensive microbiological, clinical, and imaging data from enrollment centers on 4 continents, which will allow
numerous secondary analyses. The study results will be directly useful for providers who treat acanthamoeba
keratitis as well as the patients currently affected by this blinding infection."

Sex differences in bladder cancer (BC)—men being 3-5 times more likely to have BC than women—are a long-
standing clinical observation. Such disparities persist across socioeconomic and geographic strata even when
correcting for known hazards such as smoking and other environmental risks. Yet despite many years of
research, the etiology of BC sex differences, especially as it relates to sex as a biological variable (SABV),
remains ill-defined. Using “four-core genotypes” mice that consist of four instead of two sex types, we identified
a prototypical sex-biasing tumor suppressor in females: histone lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A, aka UTX). The
X-linked KDM6A encodes a potent epigenetic regulator that expresses twice as high in females as in males due
to its escape from X-chromosome inactivation. Consistently, somatic mutations of human KDM6A, frequently
observed in BC patients of both sexes, are correlated with poor outcomes in females but not in males. We further
showed that the X chromosome has both an independent and interactive sex-biasing effects with sex hormone
pathways. Based on the published and preliminary findings, we hypothesize that sex differences in BC stems
from effects of the sex chromosome linked epigenetic regulators (i.e., KDM6A and UTY) and effects of the sex
hormones (i.e., androgens and estrogens), collectively shaping a sex specific epigenetic landscape in the
bladder and sex specific immune tumor microenvironment. We will test this hypothesis with three aims: 1)
compare the function of Y-linked UTY in males with its paralog X-linked KDM6A to determine whether UTY also
plays a tumor suppressor role in vivo; 2) determine whether KDM6A, UTY, and sex hormones collectively shape
the epigenetic landscape to drive sex differences in BC; 3) elucidate the mechanism through which KDM6A
differentially modulates pro-tumorigenic immune microenvironment in the bladder. The long-term objectives of
this proposal are two-fold: (1) identify key epigenetic and immune pathways that modulate sex-specific bladder
tumorigenesis and (2) translate mechanistic discoveries to clinical improvement in BC screening and treatment
for males and females."
10851014,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE – SUMMARY
Men are more likely to develop cancer than women in nearly every non-reproductive tissue type. Bladder cancer
typifies this sex-bias phenomenon as the male-to-female risk ratio ranking 1st in mortality and 2nd in incidence.
This male-bias persists even after adjustment for other known risk factors, supporting the idea that a fundamental
biological process(es) underlies sexual dimorphism. The overall goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to
elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex-biased incidence and mortality seen in bladder
cancer. The Administrative Core (Admin Core) provides the leadership for overall scientific direction and program
oversight and administrative, fiscal, and organizational coordination of all research activities of Projects and
shared Resource Cores. The Specific Aims of the Admin Core are as follows. Aim 1: To provide leadership for
overall scientific direction and program oversight. This includes setting the research agenda focused on
advancing basic understanding of sex differences in bladder cancer. The Admin Core will oversee programmatic
activities including scientific integrity, data management and ensuring data integrity, and direct expenditures.
Aim 2: To facilitate communication and integration of the PPG investigators and Resource Core leaders. In
addition to regular monthly virtual and in-person progress updates and communications, the Admin Core will
facilitate constructive review and enhancement of research progress through frequent and deliberate interactions
with subject matter experts via Internal and External Scientific Advisory Committees. Aim 3: To provide overall
administrative and fiscal management support. This includes ensuring compliance with all terms and conditions
of the grant, and consulting and communicating with extramural NCI/NIH staff in submitting all necessary internal
and external research reports. The Admin Core will also establish and monitor policies for inclusion of women
and ethnic minorities in research related to sex differences in bladder cancer."
10851016,"CORE 1, SYSTEMS PATHOLOGY – SUMMARY
Sex differences in cancer risk, incidence, therapeutic response, and outcomes are well-known but poorly
understood. Sex disparities relating to bladder cancers involves an interplay between sex chromosomes, sex
hormones, and tumor micro-environment, including the immune cells and epigenomic alterations. The
overarching goal of the Systems Pathology Core (Core 1) is to support Program investigators by providing
streamlined and harmonized collection, processing and analysis of human and murine biospecimens to achieve
the aims outlined in the Program projects. This core will be co-led by Dr. Anil Parwani (The Ohio State University
Wexner Medical Center [OSUMC]) and Dr. Sergei Grivennikov (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center [CSMC]) and will
provide coordinated services for this multi-institutional Program. To accomplish core goals and avoid duplication
of services, Core 1 will work closely with resources at OSU, including the Comparative Pathology and Digital
Imaging Shared Resource, the Pathology Department, the Immune Monitoring and Discovery Platform, and the
Cooperative Human Tissue Network Midwestern network. At CSMC, Core 1 will utilize resources in the Flow
Cytometry, Advanced Genomics, and Mass Cytometry Shared Resources as well as Biobank Translational
Research Core.
The specific aims and services for the Systems Pathology Core are:
 Specific Aim 1. Act as a high-quality biorepository to collect, process, bank, and distribute annotated
 human and murine bladder cancer specimens and their derivatives for Program research.
 Specific Aim 2. Provide histology and pathology services to analyze human and murine bladder cancer
 biospecimens using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence with pathological characterization and
 spatial mapping (via Co-Detection by Indexing [CODEX]). This core will also provide pathologist diagnostic
 consultation, project planning, method development, scoring, interpretation, and manuscript writing.
 Specific Aim 3. Provide flow cytometry and single cell analysis services including multiparameter flow
 cytometry analysis and sorting, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes
 and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITEseq), Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing
 (ATACseq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and standard molecular analyses. The core will harmonize processing
 and analysis techniques across Program sites to ensure data integrity and unified results.
The Systems Pathology Core will work closely with the Administrative Core and the Data Science Core,
which will provide robust data management and analysis of the data acquired herein."
10851020,"CORE 2, DATA SCIENCE – SUMMARY
The purpose of the Data Science Core (Core 2) is to provide a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary resource with
expertise in biostatistics and bioinformatics. Members of the Core 2 will collaborate closely with investigators
from each project in translating their biological hypotheses into testable statistical hypotheses and address the
corresponding aims at all levels of investigation. This consists of designing laboratory and animal experiments,
storing and managing the resulting data, statistical and bioinformatics data analyses using well-established and
pre-tested analysis pipelines, mining and integration of public data, and formulating new hypotheses based on
discoveries arising from exploration and visualization of the integrated data. The Core 2 serves as a focal
point from which investigators may be assisted with statistical and bioinformatics expertise for planning,
management, and analysis of their studies. It also develops, tests, and implements various statistical and
computational techniques, including mathematical modeling with special focus on cancer research. Types of
research supported include basic science, translational research, and omics data analysis. The large volume of
information to be generated in the proposed research projects and cores requires computer-guided approaches
for coordination of efforts and management of data. The primary role of the Core 2 will include establishing
a centralized relational database system and data management structure that facilitate entry, storage and
retrieval of all data generated by the program projects and permits the controlled exchange of information
across the projects and cores. De-identified information will be available to all investigators associated with this
Program Project Grant (PPG). Due to the sensitive nature of the information stored by the Core 2, we will
take extensive precautions to protect the confidentiality of participants. All IRB and HIPAA regulations will be
strictly enforced. By providing data access to investigators, sharing technical capabilities, and ensuring the quality
of the data, the data management component of this core will facilitate achievement of the project aims and
encourage exploratory analyses beyond those stated."
10833523,"Project Summary/Abstract
Malaria, an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, continues to pose a serious global
health problem. PfATP6, a calcium-transporting enzyme present in Plasmodium falciparum, has been
identified as a target for new antimalarial drugs. Therefore, specific and potent inhibitors of PfATP6 hold
promise as a new generation of antimalarial agents. They may also be of value as research tools for the
elucidation of the enzyme’s physiological roles. Only a few PfATP6 inhibitors are presently known and
most of them suffer from limitations due to their high structural complexity, restricting their availability. A
notable exception is a group of structurally simple phenolic compounds that were originally identified in
library screens. As they feature hydroquinone and naphthoquinone scaffolds, they can be synthesized
straightforwardly, which is a major advantage. The proposed project focusses on the design and
characterization of novel PfATP6 inhibitors, with initial focus on the hydroquinone/naphthoquinone
scaffolds. The long term goal of this research is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the
interactions between PfATP6 and small inhibitory molecules at the molecular level. As a first step, the
objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize inhibitors that are good candidates for future
development. Preliminary data suggest that the development of new PfATP6 inhibitors based on the
targeted scaffolds is an achievable goal. To reach it, the following two Specific Aims will be pursued:
Aim 1: Establish the structural requirements for effective PfATP6 inhibition. An initial library of 50-
60 potential inhibitors will be obtained from vendors or be synthesized. These compounds will first be
evaluated in inhibition assays with purified PfATP6 and then in viability assays with living parasites. The
results will furnish structure-activity relationships that identify structural elements critical for inhibition.
Aim 2: Identify novel inhibitor scaffolds using structural models of the inhibitor binding site of
PfATP6. Applying computational techniques, structural models of the currently unknown inhibitor binding
site will be generated. After having validated the models, their predictive capabilities will be employed for
virtual screens of compound libraries to identify alternative inhibitor types. The ultimate goal is to increase
the structural diversity of the PfATP6 inhibitor pool by adding compounds with new scaffolds.
 The proposed research is innovative because it will be the first to systematically explore small
molecule PfATP6 inhibitors by a combination of experimental and computational approaches. It is
significant as it provides fundamental information necessary to develop novel anti-malarial agents and
valuable new research tools. Moreover, the project will enable the PI to initiate and sustain a meritorious
research program at Sacramento State, engaging students from underrepresented minorities in a multi-
disciplinary drug design project."

This renewal of R25 AG043365-10 for NIA’s “Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate
Education (ADAR)” program, now re-entitled: “Frontiers in Alzheimer’s and Aging Research
EXPERIENCES” (FrA2RE), requests support for five cohorts of ≥12 promising undergraduates annually who
“…are eligible…if they are from economically, socially, culturally, or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds’
(responsive to PAR-20-317). FrA2RE concentrates on Structured Research Experiences and essential
mentoring to launch and sustain careers within NIA’s portfolio. Experts investigating Alzheimer’s disease and
Related Dementias (ADRD) and Aging partner with selected undergraduate trainees (applicants:
acceptances is 7¼ :1), forming Trainee: Mentoring Dyads. The ADRD and aging fields continue to grow
swiftly, yet there are too few laboratories led by URM scientists and too few new URM trainees. FrA2RE is
directed by Gerald Schatten, PhD (Pittsburgh), with Co-Investigators Laura Niedernhofer, MD, PhD,
(Minnesota), George Langford, PhD, Director of the American Society for Cell Biology’s [ASCB] new Pair-Up
program, and Research Experiences Coordinator Calvin Simerly, PhD, (Pitt) forming the Executive
Committee. Overseen by the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), co-chaired by Winston Thompson, PhD,
(Morehouse School of Medicine: MSM) and Melissa Walls, PhD (Indigenous Professor at JHU-Duluth), they
ensure that the next generation of undergraduate trainees succeeds in their career choices. FrA2RE begins
with an introductory ‘Meet and Greet’ weekend, partnering with Co-I George Langford’s Pair-Up at the MBL
(Octobers). Then after ≥ year of structured research experiences, each year’s cohort completes the program
with a Reunion held at the annual NIA’s ADAR summit-GSA congress (Novembers). FrA2R graduates,
progressing in ADRD and aging-research careers, self-identify as 34% AA/B; 38% as Hispanic American; 71%
are women, 48% are from URM institutions. FrA2RE anticipates many recruits from Tribal Nations. Five aims
are proposed: I. Sponsor meaningful Structured Research Experiences. II. Ensure Diversity, Equity,
Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) representation. III. Demystify oversight requirements by training in
responsible conduct of research (RCR). IV. Provide career planning and choices, particularly the possibility of
them joining the NIA-NIH’s research workforce; and V. Evaluate, improve, and monitor FrA2RE’s strengths
and avoid weaknesses with unbiased, quantitative, independent mechanisms. Thus, FrA2RE will continue to
enhance and expand the research careers of the most promising scientists, while ensuring their investigations
comply with NIH’s policy of ‘Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Individuals Across the Lifespan,’ particularly
NIA’s focus on improving the diagnoses, health, and well-being, among the elderly and those suffering from
Alzheimer’s Dementia and Related Disorders and their caregivers, and biological, clinical, behavioral,
social, aspects of aging, as well as helping to rectify inequities and increasing diversity."
10911789,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Many evidence-based mental health interventions have been developed to address the negative outcomes
associated with child exposure to early adversity and trauma. Despite these promising advances, however,
the majority of children served in publicly funded mental health systems do not receive evidence-based
programs (EBPs). To address this research-to-practice gap, several large-scale, system-driven
implementation efforts of multiple trauma EBPs have been launched over the last decade, including in the
states of California and Arkansas. Though these system-driven initiatives often increase EBP delivery in
community settings following the initial implementation push, long-term sustainment of EBP delivery is low.
Workforce risk factors, such as provider burnout leading to turnover, have been identified as contributing to the
poor long-term sustainment of trauma EBPs. Therefore, an important step to consider in supporting the long-
term sustainment of child trauma EBPs is to develop implementation strategies that target provider burnout
and organizational climate factors associated with decreased provider retention.
This proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will develop and pilot a
package of implementation strategies, “Supporting Providers & Preventing the Overwhelming of Resources in
Trauma Systems” (SUPPORTS), aimed increasing the sustained delivery of trauma EBPs by addressing the
factors associated with provider retention related to burnout. The development of SUPPORTS will be informed
by a needs assessment conducted with programs involved with the multiple-EBP implementation efforts in
California and Arkansas. This project will build upon the applicant’s foundation of research and clinical
experience while also providing specialized training critical for the applicant’s future development. Specifically,
the applicant requires additional training in: 1) theory and practice in implementation science with particular
emphasis on organizational management and science as it pertains to the development and testing of
implementation strategies; 2) advanced methodologies, including qualitative and mixed qualitative and
quantitative methods; and 3) healthcare economic techniques to evaluate the impact of implementation
strategies. This training will be facilitated by mentorship from the applicant’s primary sponsor, Dr. Lauren
Brookman-Frazee, and her co-sponsors, Drs. Gregory Aarons, Todd Gilmer, Lisa Kath, and Allison Hamilton.
This project will provide pilot data to motivate a subsequent NIMH R01 application to conduct a large-scale trial
of the implementation strategies supporting the sustainment of child trauma EBPs. In addition, this project will
provide the applicant with the advanced training and skills required to launch an independent research
program focused on improving mental healthcare services for children exposed to early adversity and trauma."

More than 50 million people suffer from epilepsy globally. Current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) cannot prevent
seizures in ~30% of these patients, leading to uncontrolled or refractory epilepsy. Unfortunately, these patients
are at extreme risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), which is the leading cause of death in
this cohort. Based on landmark SUDEP studies, the current hypothesis is that recurrent seizures induce extreme
cardiorespiratory suppression and/or failure through negative effects on the neural networks that regulate vital
functions such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. However, it remains unclear how repeated seizures
fundamentally affect cardiorespiratory control networks within the brainstem, and by what mechanisms these
vital systems fail in SUDEP. Here we aim to characterize the pathophysiologic consequences of repeated
seizures in a novel rat model with a known mutation in a potassium channel gene (kcnj16; SSkcnj16-/- rats), in
which a specific sound of mild intensity readily and reproducibly causes generalized tonic-clonic seizures
(GTCSs). Sound-induced GTCSs in SSkcnj16-/- rats led to a stereotypic pattern of events similar to that described
in epilepsy patients, including post-ictal generalized EEG suppression and apnea, followed by respiratory rate
(RR) and heart rate (HR) suppression. Repeated seizures (1/day for up to 10 days) led to: 1) augmented post-
ictal suppression of RR and HR, reduced ventilatory responses to hypoxic and hypercapnic challenges, and
unexpected mortality in ~33% of these rats. Brainstem tissue analyses of SSkcnj16-/- rats exposed to repeated
seizures showed evidence of time-dependent increases in inflammation and dysregulation of adenosine (ADO)
and serotonin (5-HT) – two powerful modulators of cardiorespiratory neural networks. Finally, pharmacologically
augmenting 5-HT with an SSRI (fluoxetine) prevented the progressive suppression of post-ictal RR with repeated
seizures. Herein we will test our central hypothesis that repeated seizures cause a progressive brainstem
pathology initiated by neuroinflammation and mediated by ADO and 5-HT dysfunction leading to
cardiorespiratory suppression and/or failure in SUDEP. The proposed studies utilizing this novel mutant rat
model will provide: 1) a comprehensive characterization of the progressive pathophysiological responses to
repeated audiogenic seizures, and sequence of events leading to unexpected death (Aim 1), 2) identified
mechanisms of dysfunction in inflammatory and/or neuromodulatory pathways within critical cardiorespiratory
brainstem nuclei negatively affected by repeated seizures (Aim 2), and 3) interventions that functionally test our
hypothesis by blocking neuroinflammation or modulating ADO or 5-HT system activity on the backdrop of
repeated seizures (Aim 3). We will utilize a combination of established and cutting-edge technologies to provide
unprecedented molecular, cellular and systems-level insights into the pathophysiological consequences
repeated seizures on vital control systems in order to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions aimed
at preventing or mitigating the risk of SUDEP in human epilepsy patients."

Hypoxia influences nearly all steps in the metastatic cascade, and is an independent adverse indicator for cancer
prognosis. Cellular response to hypoxia is tightly regulated, and is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors
(HIFs), with HIF-1 being the ubiquitously expressed homologue. Canonical response to hypoxia involves
stabilization of HIF-1α, which acts as a key transcriptional factor, regulating the expression of more than 1000
gene products indirectly, influencing key steps in cancer progression. However, we discovered that the
population response to hypoxia is more complex than the canonically understood response, with a small
subpopulation displaying oscillations in HIF-1α stabilization and transcriptional activity in a lactate dependent
manner. Lactate is a byproduct of glycolysis, which is itself increased due to HIF-1α activity, and can cause
degradation of HIF-1α by chaperone mediated autophagy, driving oscillations. Owing to the centrality of HIF-
1α in transcriptional regulation in hypoxic tumors, oscillations in HIF-1α in a subset of cells could have profound
consequences in gene expression, and cancer progression. Our preliminary data show that oscillatory hypoxic
input can drive large scale transcriptomic changes, resulting in increased metabolic activity, cell proliferation,
as well as altered regulation of pathways related to circadian rhythms, and invasion. These data suggest that
possibly emergent oscillations in HIF-1α activity may provide a selective advantage to these cells to escape
hypoxia induced stress response.
Our preliminary data present a strong rationale to investigate this emergent phenotype in cancer populations,
the mechanisms driving these oscillations and the phenotypic consequence of these oscillations. Furthermore,
many of the genes responded to oscillating hypoxia as a qualitatively different signal, suggesting presence of
regulatory motifs, incoherent feedforward loops (IFFLs) which could distinguish between oscillatory and
sustained HIF-1α signal. Using an integrated approach involving computational modeling, bioinformatics, and
experimentation, we will systematically identify and validate these IFFLs, as well as the co-factors necessary to
form these IFFLs along with HIF-1α. Our aim will not only shed light on the fundamental regulatory
mechanisms of decoding of oscillatory signaling in cancer, but also provide a targeting strategy to contain the
phenotypic consequences of emergent HIF-1α oscillations. Finally, we will test the consequence of emergent
HIF-1α oscillations in vivo in a mouse model of breast cancer tumorigenesis, and test if oscillating HIF-1α confers
increased tumorigenicity, proliferation, and survival. Our proposed method will facilitate mechanistically
understanding the genesis of oscillations, generation of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer, as well as
understand and target the consequence of this emergent subpopulation in influencing cancer progression."

There is a shortage of well-trained research-oriented physicians who are prepared to develop new
approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat childhood respiratory diseases. This limited pool of well-
established investigators is further threatened by a decreasing number of young physician scientists who
choose to specialize in pediatric respiratory disciplines. Training at all levels is an important priority at
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital which has established extensive programs for developing MD, PHD and
MD/PhD fellows and faculty into independent clinical and basic science investigators.
The Pediatric Pulmonary Division at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is uniquely
positioned to interest students in careers focused on pediatric respiratory disorders. Pulmonary research at
CCHMC has very strong and diverse clinical and basic science research programs and the Sleep Disorder
Center is one of the few pediatric programs in the United States that has a certified pediatric sleep fellowship
program with an extensive research focus.
This proposal will provide a 10 week summer research fellowship for 12 medical
students following their first year of medical school. The program has a well-organized method of selection of
trainees from a competitive pool of medical students with outstanding academic qualifications. A faculty of
over 35 MDs, PhDs and MD/PhDs from multiple departments with a proven record of success in research
and mentoring are available to the trainees. All investigators are well-funded in NHLBI-focused research
areas focused on pediatric respiratory disorders. Included within the program are opportunities to pursue
basic and clinical research projects with weekly meetings at which instruction in responsible conduct of
research and specific clinical and research topics in pulmonary and sleep medicine are provided.
Students present their projects to peers and mentors at the end of summer symposium. Past trainees
rate the program highly on research education received and report a very high interest in pursuing careers
in research at the end of the summer. Past trainees have been consistently successful in publishing
manuscripts and winning awards for their research at national meetings.
The strengths of our research programs in the areas of pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine combined
with an enthusiastic faculty and a well-organized summer program provides an excellent opportunity to
attract physician trainees at early and critical stages in their careers and increase the likelihood they will
want to further pursue research as physician- scientists."

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) senses and integrates diverse environmental signals
to control energy and nutrient-consuming biosynthetic processes, such as protein, lipid, and nucleotide
synthesis. mTORC1 stimulates anabolic cell growth through posttranslational and transcriptional mechanisms
leading to increased macromolecule synthesis a prerequisite to augment cellular biomass priming cells for
growth and division. In many diseases, the prominence of mTORC1 signaling reinforces the importance of
considering targeting mTORC1 signaling in several diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes,
tumor syndromes, and aging. However, direct mTORC1 targeted therapies, being conceptually and preclinically
a promising target, displayed only limited efficacy in human patients. Therefore, a better understanding of the
biology downstream of mTORC1 and the development of more effective and specific therapeutic strategies in
the treatment of mTORC1-driven diseases are needed. To achieve the biosynthetic demands accompanying
proliferation, cells must increase the transport of nutrients from the environment. Glucose, lactate, and glutamine
are the principal nutrients that promote biosynthesis and survival in mammalian cells. An emerging aspect of
nutrient utilization in aging and proliferative diseases includes the role of dietary methionine restriction, which
was recently explored in the context of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Methionine is an essential
amino acid that is catabolized and recycled in a sequence of metabolic reactions designated as the methionine
cycle. Methionine and ATP are converted into the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) via the
methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A) enzyme. Under this proposal, we propose to study the
influence of mTORC1 signaling on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis and the subsequent methylation
processes supporting anabolic metabolism. We have identified that mTORC1 stimulates SAM synthesis in
various cell settings through direct transcriptional control of MAT2A expression by c-MYC. We propose to
evaluate the influence of mTORC1 signaling on SAM synthesis in a variety of human cells (Specific Aim1). Will
identify the mechanisms by which mTORC1 signaling promotes RNA methylation, particularly the N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) mark. We will determine the role of m6A on RNA downstream of mTORC1 in the control
of cell growth (Specific Aim2). Furthermore, we will determine the implication of the mTORC1-MAT2A axis on
tumor growth and the potential therapeutic strategy derived from this mechanism (Specific Aim3). Thus, the
overall goal of this proposal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 controls RNA
methylation in normal and pathological settings. We anticipate that the proposed studies will yield new insights
into how SAM levels alter anabolic metabolism and will uncover therapeutic targets to perturb mTORC1-driven
diseases."
10875376,"ABSTRACT: Approximately one third of non-hospitalized coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients
report chronic symptoms after recovering from the acute stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Some of the most persistent and common complaints of this post-acute COVID-19
syndrome (PACS) are cognitive in nature, described subjectively as “brain fog” and also objectively measured
as deficits in executive function, working memory, attention, processing speed. The mechanisms of these chronic
cognitive sequelae are currently not understood. Most studies to-date have focused on direct SARS-CoV-2
infection of the brain; however, while direct viral brain infection is plausible in acute cases of severe and fatal
COVID-19, it is of interest to examine indirect mechanisms of chronic cognitive dysfunction that follow mild and
asymptomatic disease cases. SARS-CoV-2 inflicts damage to cerebral blood vessels and the intestinal wall by
binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and also by producing high levels of systemic
cytokines, compromising the brain’s neurovascular unit and degrading the intestinal barrier, potentially increasing
the permeability of both to harmful substances. Such substances are hypothesized to be produced by pathogenic
microbiota in the gut that, given the profound effects COVID-19 has on the gastrointestinal system, may flourish
via intestinal dysbiosis. COVID-19 may therefore create a scenario in which neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory
substances readily proliferate from the gut lumen and encounter a weakened neurovascular unit, gaining access
to the brain and subsequently producing cognitive deficits. We intend to examine such effects of SARS-CoV-2
in PACS patients longitudinally over the course of 3 study visits (baseline, 4 months, and 8 months). The
impairments of cerebrovascular function and intestinal barrier, as well as their effects on cognitive
symptomology, will be examined in 80 former COVID-19 patients who recovered from non-hospitalized acute
phases of COVID-19, yet report persistent cognitive symptoms (PACS+). These patients will be compared with
80 former similar COVID-19 patients without such symptoms (PACS-). Forty healthy control participants will also
be recruited to establish general neurovascular, intestinal, and cognitive effects of COVID-19 history.
Cerebrovascular function will be quantified via innovative functional magnetic resonance imaging of
cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to respiration of CO2 gas, while the intestinal barrier will be assessed via
concentrations of intestinal wall biomarkers in blood plasma such as fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP-2) and
zonulin. Gut dysbiosis will be established via lactulose breath testing, and levels of subsequently produced and
systemically released lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines will also
be quantified. Impairments in the neurovascular unit and intestinal barrier in the context of gut dysbiosis are
expected to be associated with greater cognitive deficits in PACS+ patients. This work may reveal immediate
recourses for resolving PACS cognitive effects via existing treatments for vascular dysfunction and gut health."

Elderly pneumonia survivors are at increased risk of developing skeletal muscle atrophy that impairs mobility, 
dementia, and cognitive dysfunction, which are perhaps the most debilitating limitations to health-span in the 
elderly. We found critical features of this multiple organ dysfunction after pneumonia are recapitulated in mice, 
allowing us to use mouse models to elucidate mechanisms that can be targeted for therapy. In the first cycle of 
this award, we found that a systemic increase in IL-6 during influenza A-induced pneumonia was necessary for 
upregulation of the E3-ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1 and muscle wasting in both young and aged animals. While 
muscle function was rapidly restored in young animals, we never observed it to recover in older animals even 
months after pneumonia. We observed that muscle satellite cells necessary for muscle repair failed to proliferate 
after pneumonia in aged, but not in young animals, which was associated with decreased expression of the 
scavenger receptor Mertk. Genetic disruption of genes required for phagocytosis (Mertk, C3, Cx3cr1) in young 
animals phenocopied the impaired satellite cell proliferation after influenza A pneumonia in aged animals. In 
parallel studies in the brain, we found that while young mice recover cognitive function after influenza A infection, 
older animals develop persistent neurocognitive impairment. Highly sensitive transcriptomic profiling of flow 
sorted microglia showed aged microglia exhibited decreased expression of scavenger receptors, including Mertk. 
This was associated with reduced expression of genes related to axonogenesis, learning and memory in whole 
brain transcriptomes from aged compared with young animals after influenza A-induced pneumonia. Tissue 
resident muscle macrophages and microglia from young mice robustly activated the integrated stress response 
(ISR) after influenza A infection as evidenced by increased expression of Activating Transcription Factor-4 (Atf4) 
and molecular chaperones, but aged mice lacked this response. 
These preliminary data support our hypothesis that age-related loss of scavenger receptor function impairs 
phagocytosis in tissue resident macrophages necessary for the molecular and physiologic recovery of skeletal 
muscle and cognitive function after pneumonia. We will determine whether these age-related changes can be 
reversed by inhibition of mitochondrial complex I via the ISR and/or ATF4 in two interrelated specific aims: 
Aim1. To determine whether scavenger receptor activity in resident skeletal muscle macrophages and 
microglia and is necessary for the recovery of cognitive and skeletal muscle function after influenza A- 
induced pneumonia. 
Aim 2. To determine whether modulation of mitochondrial metabolism, the integrated stress response 
and/or ATF4 can restore scavenger function of the microglia and skeletal muscle macrophages to 
improve cognitive and motor function in aged mice after pneumonia."

Over the past century, a marked demographic shift in the United States and other
wealthy countries has lead to childbearing occurring later and later in life. In addition to
the decrease in fecundity that accompanies aging, there is accumulating evidence that
paternal age can impact offspring health and disease. This has typically been attributed
to the effects of advanced paternal age on genetic changes in sperm that are transmitted
to children. Here, we consider an underappreciated possibility – that the aging process
affects epigenetic information carried in sperm, with resulting “epimutations” being
responsible for the altered phenotypes that manifest in the next generation.
 Here, we propose to investigate the effects of aging on key male reproductive
tissues, including the testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate. We will explore
the effects of advanced paternal age on a variety of behavioral and metabolic traits in
offspring, and will comprehensively analyze molecular differences between sperm
obtained from young and old animals.
 Together, these experiments systematically address the effects of aging on male
reproductive function and on future generations, and may provide therapeutic avenues
for mitigating the effects of delayed paternity on disease risk in children."
10923788,"Abstract
My lab currently has two main areas of interest: 1) a new chaperone system (eFOLD) that enables biogenesis
of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A); 2) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and peroxisome
degradation by selective autophagy. Errors in eEF1A biogenesis result in rapid degradation by the
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) thus making protein degradation a natural link between the two areas.
Both eFOLD and selective autophagy are controlled by distinct stress responses (e.g. heat shock vs. amino
acid starvation) but jointly serve as eﬀectors of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Both areas raise similar
questions regarding substrate selectivity: How does a speciﬁc eFOLD chaperone co-translationally recognize
an aggregation-prone region of eEF1A nascent chains? How is terminally misfolded eEF1A recognized for
degradation by the UPS? What signals on damaged or unwanted organelles are detected by speciﬁc
autophagy receptors to orchestrate encapsulation of organelle targets into autophagosomes? To answer
these questions, we are dissecting biogenesis and degradation mechanisms that select substrates of grossly
diﬀerent sizes, respond to distinct physiological cues, and have widely diﬀerent temporal dynamics. Using
yeast and human cell culture in parallel, we are exploring conserved aspects of eFOLD and selective
autophagy mechanisms shared by each species, as well as species-speciﬁc adaptations. Broadly speaking,
our projects spawn from identiﬁcation of missing factors by genetic screening or biochemical puriﬁcation but
all seek a deep mechanistic understanding of mutant phenotypes through biochemical reconstitution with
puriﬁed components and protein structure-function analysis. Along this path, we iteratively test our
hypotheses by genomics, quantitative cell microscopy, and theoretical modeling approaches."

10808902,"Project Summary/Abstract
Integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-associated weight gain in people living with HIV (PWH) is now an
established phenomenon of great concern to patients and clinicians. Obesity contributes to adverse health
outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, of which PWH already
are at a higher risk compared to the general population, particularly women. Our published preliminary data
show that over a relatively short follow-up period, virally-suppressed women switching to INSTIs exhibit greater
increases in body weight, other adiposity measures, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c% compared to
women staying on non-INSTI antiretroviral therapy (ART), resulting in a worsening of CVD risk categories. Our
new preliminary data show that among women with clinically-significant weight gain, those who switched to
INSTIs had changes in serum biomarkers (adiponectin, TNF𝛼) and the plasma metabolome consistent with
greater insulin resistance and inflammation compared to women staying on non-INSTI ART, supporting our
hypothesis that INSTIs may perturb insulin signaling, resulting in insulin resistance and increased storage of
fat—leading to gains in body weight. This proposal addresses key knowledge gaps, including the sex-specific
duration of the observed weight gain, long-term cardiometabolic consequences, and underlying mechanisms
related to INSTI use—gaps we will address by leveraging the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), the
largest and longest longitudinal interval cohort of men and women living with HIV and at-risk HIV(-) controls in
the U.S. We propose to integrate the robust clinical data and biospecimen repository of the CCS to better
understand INSTI-associated weight gain to inform future risk/benefit assessments during ART selection and
identify opportunities for preemptive intervention and/or novel drug targets. Our proposed AIMS are: 1)
Evaluate sex-specific patterns and predictors of body weight changes over time following the switch to or
addition of INSTIs; 2) Assess changes in cardiometabolic risk by sex following switch to or addition of INSTIs;
and 3) Determine sex-specific metabolic signatures associated with weight gain and subsequent
cardiometabolic risk following INSTI initiation. To accomplish this, data collected on body weight changes and
cardiometabolic risk indicators from virally-suppressed men and women enrolled in the CCS who switched to
or added an INSTI to ART will be compared to those remaining on non-INSTI ART and to co-enrolled at-risk
HIV(-) controls over a 5-year period. In addition, metabolomic and inflammatory profiles linked to INSTI weight
gain will be combined with cardiometabolic risk indicators using integrative community detection and
differential network analysis bioinformatics tools to determine sex-specific metabolic signatures associated with
an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. This study will provide new pathophysiologic insights into INSTI-
induced weight gain and may shift the paradigm for ART treatment guidelines by informing individualized
treatment strategies on use of these agents in high-risk patients."
10814145,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the most common germinal center
(GC)- derived Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas (BCLs). Although initially exhibiting an indolent behavior, FLs end
up being mostly incurable with 40-50% eventually transforming into an aggressive and lethal form of DLBCL.
Although half of DLBCLs can be cured with standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy, many patients are still
refractory and succumb to progressive or relapsed disease. In addition, the strong chemotherapy regimens used,
even when tolerated, have deleterious side and late effects. Thus, less toxic, targeted therapies are in urgent
need for this disease. Recent advances in the molecular biology of DLBCL uncovered critical pathways in the
initiation and development of these neoplasms. Of particular importance are next-generation sequencing studies
that identified mutations in epigenetic modifiers that led to the development of current active clinical trials using
epigenetic therapies in DLBC. Among their highest recurrent disease alleles are somatic mutations affecting two
closely related histone acetyltransferase (HAT) genes, Crebbp and EP300. These are frequently monoallelic,
within the HAT domain and usually mutually exclusive, suggesting that they 1) might affect a common pathway
and 2) residual WT expression of CREBBP and/or EP300 is required for cell survival. We have identified the
protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase1) as an important
factor to maintain the survival of CREBBP/EP300 mutated BCLs. A potent effective small molecule inhibitor of
CARM1 methylation activity has been recently developed and we hypothesize that targeting CARM1 methylation
activity in CREBBP/EP300 mutated BCLs causes synthetic lethality. The major goals of this proposal are to
determine how inhibition of CARM1 methylation activity affects BCLs harboring CREBBP/EP300 genetic lesions
and define the molecular mechanism responsible for the sensitivity of CREBBP/EP300 BCLs to CARM1
inhibition. We anticipate that the results obtained from these studies will impact our current understanding of the
pathogenesis of GC-derived BCLs, by providing new insights on the mechanisms of neoplastic transformation.
Altogether we ultimately expect that these results will make a strong rationale for future clinical studies using
CARM1 inhibitors in Crebbp/Ep300 mutated BCLs."
10754551,"Promoting cognition and reducing frailty in older Veterans with bright light therapy
 Frailty is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by vulnerability to stressors that increases
disability and mortality risk. Thirty percent of Veterans 65 years or older are frail, which is three-times
higher than aged matched non-Veterans. Frailty is intricately linked with cognitive impairment and
Veterans are particularly susceptible with 14 percent exhibiting cognitive decline, some with early onset
as young as 45 years of age. Importantly, 70% of frail and cognitively impaired older adults exhibit sleep
disturbances, which makes identifying and improving sleep quality an attractive therapeutic strategy to
enhance healthspan. Furthermore, this is of special interest as 55% of older Veterans experience sleep
disturbances. The goal of this study is to examine the feasibility of utilizing bright light therapy (BLT)
as a strategy to improve sleep via reduction of circadian rhythm disturbances. The long-term goal is to
assess the potential for improving cognition and reducing frailty in older Veterans. BLT works by
resynchronizing the hypothalamic biological clock via brief exposure to specific wavelengths of light
following awakening, which restores melatonin and circadian rhythms. However, BLT has not been
examined for reducing frailty in older Veteran populations. This project will therefore lay the foundation
for larger trials the evaluate BLT in the treatment and prevention of cognitive disorders and to promote
healthy aging."

whole, and of minority communities which suffer from health disparities, it is important to bring together health
disparities and aging research; the candidate is the ideal clinical investigator to bridge these two research
worlds. This proposal would enable the candidate to obtain additional training to enhance her aging research
and mentorship skills to ensure her success as PI of the CADC, while also allowing her to expand her skills
and mentorship beyond the CADC in collaboration with aging researchers at UCSF."
10759398,"Project Summary/Abstract
Osteoporosis is a common disease of aging, caused by a combination of increased osteoclastic (OC) bone
resorption and decreased osteoblastic (OB) bone formation. Low-level chronic inflammation (LLCI),
characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors induced by activated NF-κB signaling,
contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related osteoporosis by stimulating OC and/or inhibiting OB
differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which LLCI induces bone loss remain incompletely
understood. Our recently published findings indicate that protein levels of TNF receptor associated factor 3
(TRAF3), which negatively regulates NF-κB signaling, are reduced in the bone marrow (BM) of aged mice.
This is because increased amounts of TGFβ released from resorbing bone during aging induce ubiquintin-
mediated degradation of TRAF3 by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This reduction in TRAF3 levels in
MSCs leads to increased production of the chemokine, SDF1, and subsequent accumulation of a novel subset
of B cell cells (CD19+, B220+ and IgM+) expressing RANKL and CXCR4 (an SDF1 receptor) that we have
identified in the BM during aging. We have called this subset of RANKL+CXCR4+ B cells as RCBs for short.
RCBs directly induce OC formation and produce a soluble factor(s) that inhibits OB differentiation. Importantly,
either plerixafor, a FDA-approved CXCR4 inhibitor, or SM164, an inhibitor of IAP proteins, which prevents
TGFβ1-induced TRAF3 degradation in MSCs, increased trabecular bone mass, associated with reduced
accumulation of RCBs in the BM of aged mice. Our proposed studies will 1) fully characterize RCBs
phenotypically, determine if they are present in humans and if CXCR4 in B cells mediates their accumulation in
the BM of aging mice; 2) determine if TRAF3 expressed by MSCs regulates the accumulation of RCBs in BM
by modulating SDF1 expression; and 3) determine if plerixafor prevents age-related osteoporosis by depleting
RCBs from BM and if targeting it to bone increases its efficacy and reduces adverse effects for the prevention
of age-related osteoporosis. Completion of the proposed studies will determine the mechanisms whereby this
novel set of B cells contributes to bone loss by stimulating bone resorption and inhibiting bone formation
during age-related osteoporosis and importantly, will provide proof of principle that plerixafor or a bone-
targeted formulation of it may be a novel treatment for age-related osteoporosis."

sustainable “interdisciplinary translational rehabilitation Geroscience-focused research and education program”
as a cornerstone of research excellence at BU. This includes both bench to early-stage clinical investigations and
the reverse in highly prevalent disease-specific conditions such as arthritis, stroke, and frailty. To accomplish its
long-term objective, this Leadership Award will carry out three specific aims. Aim#1: Expand the knowledge in
translational rehabilitation and Geroscience by catalyzing research and education through the establishment of
a cohesive infrastructure, the Translational Rehabilitation in Geroscience Initiative (TRIG Initiative). Aim#2:
Create an exceptional research and educational environment that fosters development of successful
multidisciplinary translational rehabilitation Geroscience-based investigators with customized expertise in
preclinical and clinical science. Aim#3: Establish a pilot grant program to support the most promising
translational rehabilitation Geroscience-focused studies. These specific aims will be achieved through the
candidate’s leadership of the TRIG Initiative, the breaking down of silos, and the meaningful collaboration with
the multitude of existing resources for interdisciplinary research and education. In support of Aim 1, the TRIG
Initiative will be created through active recruitment of an interdisciplinary group of scientists, clinicians, and
trainees across Boston’s academic and clinical institutions and regular discussions on translational rehabilitation
research and Geroscience themes. In support of Aim 2, interdisciplinary partnerships with key stakeholders
across the entire university and Boston community will be developed to offer rich research and educational
opportunities for the career development of students and investigators with tailored expertise in translational
rehabilitation science and Geroscience (e.g., seminars, workshops, collaborative laboratory meetings, courses.)
In support of Aim 3, an annual pilot grant program will fund multidisciplinary, translational research that spans
between basic and early-stage clinical sciences. The candidate is an internationally recognized muscle
physiologist, a leading authority on mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia, and established the mouse frailty
phenotype assessment tool in order to conduct translational research to tease out the etiology of frailty. The

10808935,"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (Ub/Ubl) systems are attractive targets for improving public health including the
development of new therapies to overcome viral infections, cancer, neurodegeneration and other human
disorders and diseases. The ‘dual function’ Ubl systems are a variant of the canonical pathways in that the Ubls
are used in both Ubl protein ligation and as sulfur carriers to form 2-thiolated wobble uridine (s2U34) tRNA and
molybdenum cofactor (Moco). The dual function Ubl systems are thus versatile and found to be evolutionarily
conserved from archaea to humans. While relying upon an E1 for activation, the dual function Ubls do not use
conserved E2 conjugating or E3 ligase enzymes for protein modification. Rhodanese domains (RHDs) serve as
the apparent E2 modules of these systems and may determine whether the Ubl is used in Ubl ligation or sulfur
mobilization. Nevertheless, sound evidence for the role of the RHD as an E2 analog is lacking, and its interface
with the E1 and Ubl is unclear. Moreover, while components of the dual function Ubl system are required for the
2-thiolation of U34 tRNA, other factors may influence the pools of this modified tRNA to ensure proper translation
efficiency and cellular homeostasis. Included among these other factors are enzymes that modify the 5-position
of U34 tRNA, hydrolases predicted to alter the levels of a 2-thiolation U34 tRNA intermediate, and environmental
conditions such as nutrient deprivation, heat stress and oxidation. However, the role these other factors may
have in regulating s2U34 tRNA levels and the coordination of this regulation with the post-translational
modification of proteins are not well understood. Furthermore, while dual function Ubl systems modify proteins
including those associated with viral infections and chemotherapy resistance, knowledge of the biological roles
and diversity of these modifications is limited compared to other Ub/Ubl systems. Our long-term goal is to
advance understanding of dual function Ubl systems and translate this knowledge to applications of relevance
to human health. Our central hypothesis is that dual function Ubl systems are important to cell function as they
coordinate: i) sulfur mobilization pathways associated with translation efficiency (s2U34 tRNA) and metabolism
(Moco) with ii) Ubl ligations that target proteins for destruction by proteasomes, reversible inactivation, and/or
altered associations in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. In aim 1, we will determine how RHDs interface
the E1 and Ubls to mediate and potentially regulate the dual function Ubl pathway. In aim 2, we will assess
whether the 2-thiolation status of wobble uridine tRNAs is regulated, what these regulators are, and whether
these regulators are correlated with the post-translational modification of proteins. In aim 3, we will determine
how the PPI network of Cdc48a, RecJ3, RecJ4 and RNase J associates with proteins tagged with dual function
Ubl modifiers to influence RNA processing and DNA repair."
10754581,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is markedly elevated in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and two prevalent conditions in
T1D, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, precede and predict CVD. In health, insulin action at the
endothelial cell dilates blood vessels, which promotes glucose and insulin delivery to muscle for glucose uptake.
We recently showed, in adults with uncomplicated T1D, insulin commonly fails to enhance muscle microvascular
perfusion, indicating microvascular insulin resistance, and even youth with T1D have apparent microvascular
endothelial dysfunction. This is significant since the microvasculature is critical for muscle health as the direct
supplier and exchange site of substrates. Possibly due to impaired muscle health from microvascular
dysfunction, the T1D population has diminished cardiorespiratory fitness, even when matched for activity.
Mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction in T1D remain ill-defined, but oxidative stress (OS) contributes to
endothelial dysfunction at large arteries and likely the microvasculature as well. OS is clearly amplified in T1D.
Adjuvant treatments to improve endothelial function and fitness are critically needed in T1D, and such therapies
have potential to prevent CVD in future studies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1RA) improve: microvascular function in insulin resistant states, OS outside of glucose effects,
cardiorespiratory fitness, and CVD outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Exercise attenuates large artery
endothelial function and OS in T1D, and it improves microvascular endothelial function in T2D. Whether GLP-
1RA or exercise training improve muscle microvascular endothelial function in T1D is unknown. This project will
test the hypothesis that, in adults with T1D, GLP-1RA and exercise training each enhance insulin-stimulated
muscle microvascular perfusion via attenuating endothelial OS and improving endothelial cell function. Using
cutting-edge contrast enhanced ultrasound before and after randomization to 14-wks of: 1) GLP-1RA, 2) exercise
training, or 3) placebo, this study will assess whether GLP-1R agonism (Aim 1) or exercise training (Aim 2)
improves insulin-mediated microvascular perfusion and muscle function in adults with T1D. Finally, harvesting
and analyzing endothelial cells using an innovative technique will assess whether these therapies attenuate
endothelial cell OS and improve endothelial function in vivo (Aim 3). Significantly, completion of the proposed
studies will increase mechanistic knowledge of microvascular endothelial dysfunction in T1D and ascertain if
larger studies examining GLP-1RA and exercise alone/combined are merited and feasible. The proposed
research and training will support the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct larger clinical studies in T1D aiming
to reverse endothelial dysfunction/prevent CVD. Preparing for that end, goals for this award are training in T1D-
focused clinical trial work, human endothelial cell harvesting + cell biology, and biostatistics + data management.
A robust mentorship team, with complementary expertise, and abundant institutional resources will ensure
successful project completion and facilitate the promising candidate’s future independent research career."

 Species in the genus Rickettsia are Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria with both symbiotic and
pathogenic lifecycles. The global impact of rickettsial infections is illustrated by the resurgence of infections
of humans with R. rickettsia (etiologic agent of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever) in South and Central America,
or R. conorii (Boutonneuse fever) in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Strikingly, tick- and flea-borne
rickettsial diseases are also on the rise in the United States, as exemplified by recent outbreaks of R. rickettsii
in Arizona and R. typhi (etiologic agent of murine typhus) in California and Texas, further highlighting the
threats of rickettsial diseases. There are currently no vaccines to prevent rickettsioses and our insufficient
understanding of rickettsial intracellular lifestyle hinders the progression towards the development of effective
therapeutics against these increasingly recognized bacterial pathogens. Over the past four years, we identified
a complex mechanism by which pathogenic rickettsiae utilize secreted effectors to facilitate colonization by
manipulating ER structures or by modulating intracellular trafficking to subvert host defense pathways.
However, the precise mechanisms by which virulent Rickettsia species utilize this effector arsenal to subvert
host innate defense pathways to support intracellular lifestyle in endothelial cells or macrophages (MΦ)
remains ill-defined. To address these knowledge gaps, this renewal application proposes to: i) decipher how
virulent Rickettsia species utilize their effector repertoire to manipulate autophagic responses to colonize host
cells, and ii) determine the mechanism(s) by which effectors of virulent, but not avirulent, Rickettsia species
suppress inflammasome activation and manipulate MΦ polarization to promote host dissemination. Our
overall goal is to test the hypothesis that effectors from virulent species of Rickettsia, like Risk1, induce
autophagy to negatively regulate inflammasome activation and skews MΦ polarization from a M1 to M2 bias
to facilitate host colonization. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will define the mechanism(s) by which
pathogenic Rickettsia subvert autophagosomal maturation to promote host colonization. In Aim 2, we will
decipher the mechanism(s) underlying subversion of inflammasome responses and manipulation of MΦ
polarization by pathogenic Rickettsia species. These Aims are intended to unveil a link by which effectors of
pathogenic Rickettsia species manipulate autophagy to subvert inflammasome-dependent proinflammatory
cytokine signaling and skew MΦ polarization from a microbicidal milieu (M1-MΦ) to a more favorable pro-
microbial environment (M2-MΦ). These studies will lead to the identification of a link that could be exploited
for anti-virulence strategy."

The hematopoietic system is one of the organ systems most vulnerable to radiation induced short-
and long- term damage. Efficient recovery from pathological or medically induced bone marrow
failure is dictated by the intrinsic sensitivity of the hematopoietic stem cell and the bone marrow
environment niche. Identification of molecules that affect hematopoietic recovery is essential to
the development of novel medical countermeasures against radiation damage. Our preliminary
studies suggested that loss of even a single copy of Bccip confers hypersensitivity of mice to
radiation-induced hematopoietic syndrome and lymphomagenesis, and the recruitment of BCCIP
to DNA damage sites are dependent on PARP1. We hypothesize that Bccip haploinsufficiency
can sensitize the hematopoietic stem cells to radiation killing, impair the long-term competency of
stem cell to reconstitute the hematopoietic system, and/or affect the bone marrow niche’s capacity
to nourish hematopoiesis. In Aim 1, a series of long-term and short-term experiments will be used
to determine whether Bccip haploinsufficiency enhances the killing of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells, impair stem cells’ capacity to reconstitute the bone marrow, and diminish the
ability of bone marrow niche to nourish the hematopoiesis. We also hypothesize that Bccip
haploinsufficiency alters the bone marrow progenitor cell susceptibility to tumor initiation and
subsequent tumor progression. In Aim 2, we will test this hypothesis by examining the tumor
clonality and defining the landscapes of chromosome rearrangements in the tumors formed in
wild type and Bccip haplo-insufficient mice using newly developed genomic and computational
approaches. In Aim 3, we will determine the PARylaiton dependent mechanism by which BCCIP
is recruited and retained at the DNA damage sites. Completion of these studies will elucidate a
unique role of Bccip in modulating hematopoiesis after radiation damage and in suppressing
radiation-induced tumorigenesis."

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) describes the abrupt onset of ventricular arrhythmias that kills more Americans
than any other disease. These life-threatening changes in electrical activity are most often observed in people
who have suffered a prior myocardial infarction (MI). Unfortunately, our ability to prevent SCD is limited by an
incomplete understanding of what actually triggers the underlying arrhythmias. The surviving tissue
surrounding the infarcted area of the heart, known as the border zone, is the primary sight of reentrant
electrical activity that sustains these events. Electrical heterogeneities in myocytes found in the border zone
and more remote areas of the myocardium create a substrate for reentry. However, the generation of
arrhythmias associated with SCD is also linked to an increase in sympathetic tone and a decrease in
parasympathetic tone. In fact, chronic vagal nerve stimulation (cVNS) has been shown to reduce the incidence
of ventricular arrhythmias following an MI. Yet, it is not known how myocytes found in different areas of the
infarcted heart respond to autonomic neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh).
Furthermore, there is evidence the incidence of arrhythmias is also affected by the release of co-transmitters
such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Our working hypothesis is that the
sympathetic neurotransmitters NE and NPY, as well as the parasympathetic neurotransmitters ACh and VIP,
alter the arrhythmogenic potential of the infarcted heart by regulating electrical heterogeneity as well as
triggered activity in different areas. In this Project, we will address the following questions: 1) how do NPY and
VIP affect the electrical properties of ventricular myocytes, 2) do sympathetic and parasympathetic
neurotransmitters affect electrical heterogeneity and triggered activity of myocytes in the border zone and
remote areas of the infarcted heart differently, and 3) does cVNS reduce arrhythmogenesis by remodeling the
electrical and pharmacological properties of myocytes in the infarcted heart. A combination of single cell
electrophysiology, molecular biology, immunocytochemistry, and biochemical techniques will be used to
answer these questions. Changes occurring at the cellular level identified in this Project will be integrated with
information about changes in the distribution and function of autonomic nerves observed at the whole heart
level in Projects 2 and 3 of this Program Project by using a computational modeling approach to investigate the
mechanistic basis for autonomic regulation of arrhythmias. The results of this project will provide the foundation
from which the efficacy of targeted neuromodulation can be mechanistically assessed, leading to improved
therapeutic strategies for preventing SCD."
10904666,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Project 3
Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) occur after myocardial infarction (MI), and are a common cause of
sudden cardiac death. Sympathovagal imbalance, resulting from structural and functional remodeling of
cardiac sympathetic neurons, promotes the initiation of VT/VF after MI. This process remains poorly
understood, and current drugs that prevent sympathetic excess are limited by significant side effects and
inadequate efficacy. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is a promising therapy to restore sympathovagal balance
with supporting data from animal models and humans, but the mechanisms underlying its benefits are poorly
understood. The goal of this proposal is to test the novel hypothesis that chronic VNS exerts its protective
effects against VT/VF and progressive cardiac dysfunction primarily by impacting sympathetic neuronal
dysfunction after MI.
 In preliminary studies, we have shown that sympathetic dysfunction encompasses several key
elements that include neuronal dysfunction, satellite glial activation, neuroinflammation and aberrant
spatiotemporal neural activity within sympathetic ganglia such as stellate ganglia. Pilot studies from our group
show that VNS exerts a governing effect on sympathetic function acutely, independent on the level of
sympathoexcitation, and chronically mitigates arrhythmogenesis following MI. We will test our hypotheses
using novel tools from a multidisciplinary team of investigators in 3 specific aims in pigs with chronic MI. We
will delineate the impact of chronic VNS on structural and neurochemical remodeling in sympathetic neurons
(Aim 1). We will determine whether chronic VNS, with its anti-inflammatory effects, attenuates satellite glial
activation and neuroinflammation in stellate ganglia (Aim 2). Finally, we will dissect the impact of chronic VNS
on spatiotemporal activity of stellate ganglion neurons using novel computational tools applied to high-
resolution high-fidelity in vivo extracellular neural recordings from the stellate ganglion (Aim 3). We will directly
link the neuroanatomical (Aim 1), neuroinflammatory (Aim 2), and neurophysiologic (Aim 3) remodeling to
spontaneous and inducible VT/VF, as well as proarrhythmic local myocardial arrhythmogenic mechanisms.
The results of this proposal will 1) advance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of VNS
efficacy and 2) potentially uncover novel pathways by which sympathetic dysfunction can be prevented or
reversed, to which new therapeutic strategies can be devised."

10827414,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Telomerase is critical for health and longevity, but there is a fundamental lack of understanding of how it is
regulated in human cells. This knowledge gap impedes the ability to develop therapies for a growing spectrum
of disorders in which telomerase dysfunction is implicated. The long-term goal of this project is to be able to
manipulate telomerase in human cells for therapeutic benefit, with a key target being the hematopoietic system.
The level of the noncoding telomerase RNA component TERC is a critical determinant of telomerase function in
cells. Low TERC levels resulting from genetic mutations cause a wide spectrum of degenerative disorders,
including dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anemia, MDS/leukemia, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary
fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Recent work identifies the non-canonical polymerase PAPD5 as a key negative regulator
of TERC. PAPD5 is thus a novel target for small molecule inhibitors to restore TERC and telomeres in human
diseases. What is not known is the basis of selective regulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) by PAPD5, nor
whether inhibiting PAPD5 will be therapeutically effective. The overall objectives of this proposal are (1) to
understand how PAPD5 selectively regulates ncRNAs, and (2) to determine the in vivo efficacy of PAPD5
inhibitors in restoring hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. The central hypothesis is that PAPD5
selectively regulates TERC and a small number of ncRNAs, providing a therapeutic window for systemic
PAPD5 inhibition to restore telomeres and self-renewal capacity in stem cells. The rationale for our work
is that understanding mechanisms of selectivity and demonstrating therapeutic efficacy of small molecule PAPD5
inhibitors will provide a strong scientific framework for their development as treatments for bone marrow failure
and a range of diseases. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: (1) Identify the
mechanisms of selective regulation of ncRNAs by PAPD5, and (2) Determine the therapeutic efficacy of
PAPD5 inhibitors in vivo. Under the first aim, biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to rigorously
identify bona fide PAPD5 targets, and to decipher the regulatory logic of the PAPD5-dependent transcriptome in
human cells, emphasizing HSCs. Tools and techniques that have been developed and demonstrated to be
feasible in the applicants’ hands will be used. Under the second aim, the therapeutic efficacy of small molecule
PAPD5 inhibitors to restore telomere maintenance and HSC function in vivo will be determined. New approaches
to overcome interspecies differences in telomere biology and model human HSC failure will be applied. The
approach is innovative because PAPD5 is a long-sought, novel and tractable target regulating TERC, the
inhibition of which may enable a systemic telomerase-modulating therapy that selectively impacts stem cells.
The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to yield new strategies to manipulate telomerase in
a growing number of hematopoietic and degenerative disorders including aplastic anemia, MDS/leukemia,
pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, in which telomerase dysfunction is implicated but for which there are few
if any curative therapies."
10847368,"Project Abstract
Maternal mortality in the US continues to rise, outpacing rates in nearly every other developed country. Over
half of women who experience pregnancy-related death do not have risk factors that are identifiable prior to
labor. For these women, the cascade of events ending in death or morbidity often begins with labor
dysfunction. Current literature on the physiologic determinants of labor dysfunction suggests that lipotoxicity
may account for decreased uterine contractile strength and coordination. Lipotoxicity is a system-wide
condition occurring when excess free fatty acids are deposited in cellular membranes and non-adipose tissues,
causing chronic inflammation and cellular dysfunction in both obese and non-obese women. Black women are
3-4 times more likely to die of pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women, and social
determinants of health appear to increase their risk of experiencing changes in metabolism during pregnancy.
We theorize that alterations in lipid profiles may provide a missing link connecting Black women's pregnancy
experiences, health, and labor outcomes. The proposed study will use a systems biology approach to
determine how the lipid changes that precede labor dysfunction develop over the course of pregnancy in a
cohort of Black women receiving prenatal care in a freestanding birth center (Aim1), and measure the extent to
which these lipid changes are influenced by pregnancy health, including maternal behaviors, body
composition, social determinants of health, and serum adipose tissue hormones (Aim 2). Finally, we will
evaluate the influence of prenatal model of care on pregnancy health and lipid perturbations during pregnancy,
comparing the birth center cohort to a cohort of Black women receiving prenatal care in a hospital setting (Aim
3). Recruitment of the birth center cohort will target retention of 150 women who begin prenatal care in first
trimester for planned questionnaire and blood collections. Following the completion of labor, detailed chart-
review will be performed to identify cases and comparisons for labor dysfunction comparisons. For our final
analyses examining the influence of prenatal model of care on lipids and labor outcomes, we will leverage
questionnaire and lipidomics data from an existing cohort of 167 Black women with similar levels of perinatal
risk to the birth center cohort who received prenatal care in nearby hospital clinics. Differential analysis will
then be used to compare lipid features and pregnancy exposures between groups. The proposed research
study brings together cutting-edge technology and a multi-disciplinary team with scientific expertise in labor
dysfunction, body composition measurement, comprehensive nutritional and physical activity analysis,
lipidomics, racial disparities investigations, and systems biology approaches to confront labor dysfunction--one
of the most impactful conditions affecting maternal morbidity and mortality. Results obtained from this study will
provide functional information to make the identification of biomarkers that predict labor dysfunction a real
possibility, changing the future for early detection, targeted intervention, and prevention of labor dysfunction."

disciplinary curricula that move beyond a “linear sum” of single-discipline coursework. The PNA curriculum
responds to this changing landscape with a multidisciplinary curriculum that integrates disciplines traditionally
taught in separate departments: population sciences, neurosciences, gerontology, and data sciences.
The PNA curriculum has four components: (1) Individual development plan, crafted and monitored by a multi-
disciplinary mentoring team, (2) PNA-focused core courses that teach foundational knowledge in PNA, (3)
Research practicum with clinical rotations for hands-on training in rigorous research; (4) professional
development activities to lead and work with multi-disciplinary research teams. Trainees acquire tangible skills
to pursue research careers in the academic, government, and private sectors, including: scientific reasoning,
scientific writing and communication, study design, data management, statistics, and public speaking.
The PNA Program is administered by the Department of Epidemiology, with co-Directors Dr. Ganguli in
Psychiatry and Dr Rosano in Epidemiology, who share responsibility for all aspects of its function. The PNA
training formula benefits from extensive resources at Pitt. The 32 PNA program faculty are affiliated with the
Schools of Public Health (Epidemiology, Biostatistics), Arts and Science (Neuroscience, Psychology), Medicine
(Neurology, Biomedical Informatics), as well as NIA-funded Centers of excellence and Institutes: the Alzheimer
Disease Research Center, the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, the Brain Institute, the Center for

socially living baboons. Specific aim two expands on the AD/ADRD model development by calculating a DNA
methylation clock for baboons in the SPF18BRR and by measuring a panel of 30 biomarkers on all animals 3
years of age and older at two different timepoints. Additionally, we will collect cerebrospinal fluid from
animals 15 years of age and older and will use it to measure a panel of 18 human neuroscience biomarkers.
In specific aim three we will perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on nine olive baboons that were bred
at the Southwest National Primate Research Center that we would like to add to our conventional baboon
breeding colony to diversify the population genetics before we close the SPF18 colony to new animal
introductions. We will also perform targeted WGS on additional animals to further expand the understanding

10904660,"ABSTRACT – Project 1
Sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure are the leading causes morbidity and
mortality in the United States. The autonomic nervous system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of
arrhythmias and heart failure. Neuraxial modulation represents an important avenue for therapeutic
intervention. However, the structural and functional determinants of the release of neurotransmitters and
peptides in the myocardium in health and disease, which effectively govern cardiac excitability and mechanical
function, as well as propensity toward arrhythmias, remain largely unknown. Myocardial scars seen in ischemic
and nonischemic cardiomyopathy show abnormal innervation and nerve sprouting at the border zone of scars
due to neural remodeling, which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ventricular arrhythmias. We
propose to test “The Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity of Neurotransmitter Release Hypothesis’ – which
postulates that scars alter the ultrastructure of nerves and cause non-uniform reflex-mediated neurotransmitter
release in the myocardium and represents a crucial/proximate cause of lethal arrhythmias. The major goal of
this project is to investigate the structural (myocardial) and functional (neural) changes in the heart that occur
because of heart disease and subsequently lead to ventricular arrhythmias. In aims 1 and 2, we will determine
the ultrastructure and define the nerve-myocyte stoichiometry and release profiles of neurotransmitters and
peptides in normal and diseased hearts in response to physiological stressors and specifically define areas of
non-uniform release of neurotransmitters. In aim 3, we will determine the underlying mechanism and potential
benefit of vagal nerve stimulation in mitigating the pathological remodeling related to scar formation and
autonomic innervation. Regional structural and functional changes in innervation of scar and border zone
regions will be studied using high density electrophysiological mapping and real time neurotransmitter and
neuropeptide measurements which will be correlated with structural changes at the border zones of infarcts
using tissue clearing techniques in a relevant large animal model and in human hearts. Understanding the
underlying myocardial and neural mechanisms leading to arrhythmias has the potential to develop and
precisely target therapies that inspire therapies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death and progression of
heart failure."
10832523,"Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cardiomyocyte survival and death play a
crucial role in the pathogenesis of heart failure due to the limited capacity of cardiomyocytes to proliferate or
repair. Recently, multiple clinical studies have identified TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its
receptor, death receptor 5 (DR5), as being two of the most powerful predictive markers of heart failure
development and severity. Additionally, whole transcriptome analysis from our laboratory identified TRAIL and
DR5 alterations in a mouse model of heart failure and its involvement in cardioprotective, EGFR-dependent
signaling. While there have been multiple studies demonstrating high expression of TRAIL and DR5 in the
heart, their function has never been investigated. The role of TRAIL/DR5 in cancer has been extensively
studied due to the ability of TRAIL to selective induce apoptosis in cancer cells, however, in non-transformed
cell types, the function of TRAIL/DR5 is unclear. Due to the connection of TRAIL/ DR5 with heart failure and
unidentified role of TRAIL/DR5 in the heart we have been exploring the impact of DR5 signaling in
cardiomyocytes. Using pharmacological agonists of DR5, we observe that DR5 activation does not induce
canonical death receptor signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes but activates the pro-growth and survival
kinase ERK1/2. Using specific inhibitors for signal transduction pathways, we observe that ERK1/2 activation
involves the transactivation of EGFR and results in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Therefore, we hypothesize that
DR5 activation in cardiomyocytes plays a non-canonical, cardioprotective role through the activation of pro-
growth and survival mechanisms. Completion of the following research proposal will contribute important
information to this novel field of study through the identification of the function and signaling mechanisms

A key component of Phase III CoBRE funding for the Center for Cancer Biology Research (CCBR) is support of
the Flow Cytometry Core (Core B). This core, established in 2011 with the initiation of Phase I, is extensively
used by CCBR investigators, those at Sanford Research at large, investigators from regional institutions, and
recently by contractual users. The Core provides state-of-the-art equipment for flow cytometry, cell sorting, and
related sample preparation. The Flow Core staff provides a wide array of services in terms of instrumentation,
training, and experimental design. This allows investigators to obtain high quality data to support publications
and grant proposals. For Phase III, the Core presents a feasible plan for transitioning to independence. This plan
includes a fee-for-services schedule. Also, the Core will continue to expand its services through the acquisition
of state-of-the-art instrumentation and a growing user base, including additional clientele from regional
institutions and contractual arrangements. Already, the reputation of the Core's quality work and quick
turnaround has expanded regional and contractual usage. Based on this growth and substantial institutional
support through personnel salaries and equipment purchases and maintenance, self-sufficiency will be attained.

10836395,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL
The proposed program project, A Multidisciplinary Assessment of Risks of Vaping in Early Life (Project
MARVEL), takes an integrated approach to assessing vaping behavior and the emergence of dependence;
elucidating the impact of vaping on adolescent health; and generating empirically-tested messages to reduce
adolescent vaping. In 2020, 19.6% of high school students, representing over 3 million adolescents, reported
past month vaping. Moreover, the proportion of high school students who report frequent vaping has increased
substantially. Significant gaps exist in understanding current patterns of youth vaping, the relationship between
vaping and dependence, the impact of vaping on health, and how best to stem the surge in adolescent vaping.
The overarching aims of this program project are to: (1) Assess the use of nicotine-containing vaping products
and the relationship between vaping and the emergence of symptoms of dependence, including individual,
interpersonal, and environmental factors that may moderate the impact of vaping; (2) Determine how vaping
disrupts health and well-being through its impact on key physiological and psychological systems that are still
developing during adolescence; and (3) Evaluate the potential impact of vaping prevention messages,
developed based on emerging evidence of health harms from Project MARVEL and focused on the ways in
which vaping affects adolescents’ bodies and lives. Four projects are proposed, supported by four cores.
Project 1 will assess the relationship between vaping and the emergence of dependence, describe how vaping
impacts the development of adolescent well-being, and determine how adolescents perceive the impact of
vaping on their daily lives. Project 2 will examine the association between vaping, neurodevelopment,
autonomic regulation, and cognitive/psychological skills. Project 3 will determine how vaping impacts
respiratory health by examining symptoms, function, and early molecular alterations in airways. Project 4 will
develop, optimize, and evaluate messages about novel health harms of vaping, identified in Projects 1-3 and
the extant literature, that resonate with high school students. The Administrative Core will manage operations
for Project MARVEL, facilitate interactions between projects, and coordinate study participation. The
Biostatistics Core will ensure our designs and analyses maximize validity, generalizability, and efficiency. The
Adolescent Research Support Core will address the unique challenges of conducting research with a large
number of adolescents from multiple schools, facilitate recruitment and retention, ensure protection of human
subjects, and maintain and leverage community partnerships. Finally, the Biomarker and Product Evaluation
Core will characterize the most commonly used products and provide objective markers of exposure and
biological effect. Project MARVEL has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of how vaping
impacts adolescent health and how best to intervene to reduce vaping during this critical developmental period."
10836397,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1: Vaping Behavior, the Emergence of Dependence, and Well-being
Since 2014, vaping has been the most popular form of tobacco use among high school students, with over 1.7
million reporting current use in 2021. Recent evidence also indicates an increase in the proportion of
adolescents who vape 20 or more days a month, highlighting a surge in the levels of use often associated with
dependence. Understanding vaping behavior, including frequency and intensity of use, during the critical years
of high school, and the relationship with dependence is central to vaping prevention. Prevention also relies on
knowledge of the health effects of vaping that are relevant to adolescents. One such effect is dependence, a
recognized psychiatric disease with an associated pathophysiology that can impact adolescent life. However,
the potential health impact of vaping extends beyond dependence. Modern definitions conceptualize health as
“a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”
(World Health Organization). Adolescent well-being involves a number of characteristics (e.g., perseverance,
connectedness) that depend on fundamental skills (cognitive, emotional, social) acquired during this critical
period of development. A large literature demonstrates how functioning within these domains is vulnerable to
the impact of nicotine, suggesting that vaping, particularly when associated with dependence, is likely to impact
adolescent well-being. The overall goal of Project 1 is to characterize how vaping leads to dependence and
impacts the well-being of adolescents. The Specific Aims are: 1) Prospectively assess vaping behavior and the
emergence of symptoms of vaping dependence during adolescence; 2) Describe how vaping is related to well-
being; and 3) Leverage a mixed methods approach to improve survey measures and deepen understanding of
how changes in vaping, dependence, health and well-being impact adolescent daily life. To address these
aims, Project 1 will screen over 13,500 high school students (all grades) to recruit a sample of vaping and non-
vaping students to participate in an online survey. The initial survey will be conducted in over 4300 students
from all grades (cross-sectional). Freshmen, Sophomores and Juniors who are recruited into the online survey
will form a longitudinal cohort of over 3100 students with additional waves of surveys conducted every six
months. A subset (N=360; 240 vapers) of the longitudinal cohort will complete lab-based assessments at two
time points, 18 months apart (i.e., corresponding to Waves 1-3 and 4-6). Finally, up to 40 participants will
complete in-depth interviews after Wave 1 and up to 40 participants will complete interviews after Wave 4-6.
Project 1 will provide a rich characterization of the natural history of vaping and the impact it has on adolescent
development and well-being. This information is central to the overarching goal of Project MARVEL – to
prevent youth vaping through empirically-based and adolescent relevant health communications."
10836403,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2: Impact of Adolescent Vaping on Brain Health
There is growing concern that vaping nicotine may affect brain health during adolescence, a period of rapid
maturation. Nicotine directly affects nicotinic cholinergic receptors throughout the nervous system resulting in
functional changes in many late developing brain regions, including areas implicated in attention, memory,
executive function, social cognition, and emotion processing. Prior research established that nicotine (in animal
models) and smoking (in humans) affects brain structure and function; cognitive and psychosocial function;
and autonomic regulation. However, very little is known about how vaping nicotine, including frequency of use,
product characteristics, and cumulative exposure, impacts adolescent brain health. Furthermore, other
chemical constituents of vaping aerosols (e.g., acrolein) that could also affect brain development. Our
overarching hypothesis is that vaping affects brain health in specific regions/networks and associated
cognitive/psychosocial domains related to attention, memory, executive function, social cognition, and emotion
processing. Our novel mechanistic hypothesis is that the effects of vaping on the brain are related to shifts in
autonomic nervous system towards increased sympathetic and diminished parasympathetic tone with
associated changes in cerebral blood flow and connectivity in regions and networks of interest. Our three
Specific Aims are 1) Determine the effects of vaping on brain function and structure in adolescents; 2) Examine
the effects of vaping on cognitive and psychosocial development, 3) Assess the effects of vaping on autonomic
nervous system function. We will assess 360 adolescents recruited from the longitudinal Online Survey for a
Lab-Based Study, using a 2:1 ratio of Current Vapers to Never Tobacco Users, minimizing potential confounds
with additional exclusion criteria (e.g., marijuana use). Participants will be tested at a 2 time points, 18 months
apart. This study will be the first and largest to date that longitudinally quantifies key physiological and
developmental changes associated with adolescent vaping, providing data on the impact of vaping on brain
structural/functional, cognitive and psychosocial maturation and autonomic nervous system function. The
findings from Project 2 will be utilized by Project 4 as potential targets for vaping prevention messages."
10836406,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3: Lung Health and Inflammation
Research has shown that adolescent cigarette smoking alters lung development, adversely affects respiratory
health, and contributes to chronic low-grade, systemic inflammation linked with the development of vascular
disease and cancer. However, the effects of vaping have not been fully evaluated. Rather than waiting
decades to fully assess the risk of vaping on the development of disease, we propose to characterize early
respiratory, physiological, and molecular effects of vaping during adolescence. Given the increasing number of
adolescents who vape frequently (20+ days a month), a better understanding of the health consequences of
vaping is critical to inform public health communication efforts. To address the gaps in knowledge of the
potential harms of vaping, the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Risks of Vaping in Early Life (MARVEL) Project
3 will test the hypothesis that vaping impairs respiratory health as early as adolescence, and that vaping
results in overlapping molecular signatures with cigarette smoke exposure and smoking-related disease
pathogenesis. Specifically, we will: 1) Characterize the effects of vaping on respiratory health in adolescence;
2) Identify molecular alterations in airways associated with vaping and respiratory health outcomes; and 3)
Characterize oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory alterations associated with vaping. To detect early
respiratory, physiological, and molecular effects of vaping during adolescence, we will leverage comprehensive
phenotypic characterization including bronchitic symptoms of over 4000 high school students from the Online
Survey, and repeated measures of lung function (St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire and spirometry) and
collection of biospecimens (nasal epithelial cells and blood) from 360 high school students, at two lab visits 18
months apart. Nasal epithelial cells are robust surrogates for lower airway bronchial epithelial cells, and will be
used to examine the effects of vaping on the epigenome and transcriptome. Peripheral blood will be used to
examine the effects of vaping on systemic inflammation. Dose-dependency will be assessed by detailed self-
report, biomarkers (saliva cotinine, TNE, CEMA) and product characterization. Knowledge gained from Project
3 will inform the development of health communications in Project 4 relevant to the early respiratory and
systemic inflammatory effects of vaping during adolescence."
10880547,"The adaptive, platform nature of the I-SPY trials places a number of additional requirements on the collection of clinical
and laboratory data and in the management and portability of the resulting data. In particular, the adaptive randomization
engine relies upon near real-time access to MRI and pathology assessments. However, as I-SPY and the field have grown
and evolved, so too have the requirements of the underlying data systems and architecture, particularly for the advanced
designs of I-SPY2.2. The Information Technology and Systems Integration core seeks not only to provide high quality
services to the projects, but also to engage in the development and validation of innovative tools that further the program
project’s ability to meet and or exceed their research goals. In the past grant period, the core has also exceeded the aims
laid out in the original proposal. We built out and deployed a robust electronic data capture (EDC) platform and
successfully migrated 10 years of trial data into the new system. In a pilot implementation, we demonstrated the
OneSource system that seamlessly permits data to be pulled directly from electronic health records into study case report
forms (CRF), can improve data fidelity and timeliness of CRF completion, giving program project teams quicker access to
higher quality data. We architected a biomarker repository platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is fully
integrated with Google Big Query and leverages the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) biomarker management and
visualization platform [ProBE]. Finally, we implemented systems for the collection and management of electronic Patient
Reported Outcomes that have vastly improved completion rates for quality of life and adverse event reporting by program
project investigators.
The IT and Systems Integration Core will continue to provide functionality to the I-SPY2.2 trial in a number of ways. We
will continue implementing OneSource across the majority of the 32+ clinical sites and integrate additional data types
including pathology/immune multiplex, imaging, whole exome, ctDNA, RNA seq into our cloud repository. Over the
course of the proposed work, we will develop a resource for investigators so they can interactively view and query all the
various types data in an integrated fashion, and connect to external data sources such as TCGA, to allow comparisons
between I-SPY and other breast cancer cohorts. This repository will be enhanced by integrating machine learning,
contextual-level visualizations, and other external database tools."
10880549,"This Program Project comprises four individual projects, which propose to: implement and test imaging, pathology, and
molecular biomarkers to optimize treatment switching within the I-SPY2.2 sequential multiple assignment randomized

decisions and prognostic modeling of long-term outcomes (Project 2); characterize of the biology of non-responders using
imaging and molecular analysis to inform treatment (Project 3); and develop and optimize of a portfolio of agents that
matches biology of patients within the I-SPY2.2 framework (Project 4). The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core will act
as a centralized dedicated team where the analytical goals of these projects converge. We will work closely with each of
the project teams to develop project-specific analysis plans and provide analytical support. We will develop novel
statistical methodologies for the complex trial designs and build predictive models across multiple modalities (imaging,
pathology, molecular profiles and their combination). Our goal is to facilitate cross-project interactions to refine robust
decision algorithms to optimize adaptation of treatment for individual women based on their response within the I-SPY
2.2 trial according to the quality standards necessary to evaluate experimental regimens within a regulatory evidence
generation framework.
Specifically, the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core has three aims:
Specific Aim 1: To provide innovative bioinformatics and statistical modeling and analytical approaches needed by the
projects to achieve their Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 2: To develop SMART methods that incorporate quality of life and residual cancer burden measures into
the I-SPY2.2 Program Project framework (Project 1, Aim 3).
Specific Aim 3: To synthesize biomarker and drug response data within and across projects into actionable clinical
information for implementation in I-SPY2.2."
10833532,"Project Summary/Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its related neuropathology are linked to a set of
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) that come with marked clinical, personal and real-life burden. However,
the underlying neural mechanisms of NPS are poorly defined, hindering novel treatment approaches. Core
among these NPS are: 1) sleep disturbance, and 2) anxiety. Moreover, both sleep impairment and anxiety
are independently associated with a faster rate of longitudinal cognitive decline, reinforcing a particular
focus on their overlap. However, the possibility that AD pathology, impaired non-rapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep and the NPS feature of anxiety are actually inter-related, representing a novel brain
mechanism explaining why Aβ is associated with increased anxiety, has not been examined. Here, we seek
to test a core mechanistic hypothesis: The impact of Aβ burden on anxiety is orchestrated through beta-
amyloid (Aβ)-related impairment of NREM slow-wave sleep, which in turn, amplifies next-day anxiety
through impaired mPFC-amygdala emotional brain regulation. If supportive, these studies would (i)
advance our basic understanding of how AD-related pathology mechanistically impacts the NPS feature of
anxiety through impairment of NREM sleep, and (ii) establish sleep improvement as a novel modifiable
therapeutic intervention target that may de-escalate anxiety linked with the AD disease state, and potentially
the rate of longitudinal disease/cognitive decline."
10829845,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies, representing a diverse
collection of complex diseases. After 30-40 years without change of treatment strategy, the past 2 years have
seen several drug approvals, including the most recent approval for the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, used in
combination with hypomethylating agents. While response rates of 60-80% with this combination are
encouraging, the 1-year survival rate is still only at 30-40%. For the past decade, we have executed a
functional genomics platform applied directly to primary samples from patients with AML and other hematologic
malignancies. Using this platform, we have collectively studied over 2,500 primary patient specimens, and we
have included a series of venetoclax combinations on this platform for the past five years. From this dataset,
we have identified several novel venetoclax combinations with better activity than venetoclax plus
hypomethylating agents, and we have started a clinical trial for one of the most promising of these
combinations, venetoclax with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib. For this project, our long-term goals are to
optimize and translate the most effective venetoclax drug combinations into the clinic for patients with
AML. Our immediate goals are to understand the specific biology driving venetoclax combination
synergy and identify biomarkers and mechanisms of response. Based on the central hypothesis that
venetoclax combinations exhibit patterns and mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance that are
specific to cell differentiation states and transcriptional programs. To accomplish these goals, 3 Aims are
proposed: 1) Cell differentiation state as a mechanism of drug combination sensitivity and resistance – We will
perform analytics of cell differentiation state in our large patient sample dataset as well as laboratory models of
forced differentiation in cell lines and patient samples. 2) Synthetic lethality as a guide to mechanisms of drug
combination sensitivity and resistance – Our preliminary data from genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens point to
specific candidate genes that impact on mediators of venetoclax combination activity. These candidates will be
explored with genetic and pharmacologic perturbations. 3) Clinical validation of biomarkers and mechanisms
of sensitivity and resistance – We have opened a clinical trial testing venetoclax combined with ruxolitinib in
AML. We will have access to longitudinal specimens from patients on this trial. We will perform ex vivo drug
testing on these trial specimens coupled with transcriptional and proteomic studies to evaluate the ability of
each data type to predict clinical responses. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a
major impact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective
drug combination strategies."
10868772,"SUMMARY
Despite the clear link between sugar overconsumption and metabolic syndrome, how the gut senses and
communicates the presence of sugar to the brain remains unknown. Studies have shown that preference for
sugars depends not on their sweet taste in the oral cavity, but rather on their entrance into the intestine.
Therefore, understanding how the gut communicates information about ingested sugars could open a new path
for pharmacotherapeutics for treating metabolic disease. The mechanisms of sensing nutrients in the gut are
thought to involve the slower paracrine and endocrine action of peptides released from enteroendocrine cells.
In recent years it has become evident that in addition to their canonical paracrine function, enteroendocrine
cells also form synapses with nerves in the underlying intestinal and colonic mucosa. These gut epithelial cells
that form synapses are known as neuropod cells. Our overall hypothesis is that glutamatergic neuropod cells
in the small intestine transduce sugar stimuli to guide sugar preference. This hypothesis builds on recent
observations: 1) the duodenal epithelium contains a population of glutamatergic neuropod cells labeled by the
vesicular glutamate transporter 1; 2) vagal nerve firing in response to intraduodenal sugar stimuli depends on
glutamatergic signaling; and 3) a mouse's preference for sugar over non-caloric sweetener is abolished by
silencing a subset of enteroendocrine cells. The objectives in this application are three-fold: 1) to determine
how glutamatergic neuropod cells are activated by sugar; 2) to establish the glutamatergic gut-to-vagus nerve
signaling pathway activated by sugars; and 3) to determine the role of glutamatergic neuropod signaling on
sugar preference. The outcomes of this research could serve as a foundation to design gut-based
pharmacotherapies that seek to curb the desire to consume sugar by targeting the receptors and signaling
molecules of glutamatergic epithelial cells."

Ocular surface disease has an astounding economic burden of over $12 billion per year for
treatment. While current standards of care only treat symptoms rather than address the cause(s)
of disease, recent data suggest that manipulation of the microbiome may be a potential avenue
to treat and/or prevent disease. Recently, an ocular commensal bacterium, Corynebacterium
mastitidis (C. mast), was identified and shown to protect the ocular surface from infection with C.
albicans and P. aeruginosa. Despite this beneficial immunity, there is still a need to understand
the microbial factors that govern ocular colonization and ability to stimulate the host immune
response. The foundation of the proposed studies was built upon preliminary data acquired from
genomically and phenotypically screening over 30 clinically relevant isolates of Corynebacterium
spp. and nearly 2000 transposon mutants of C. mast. Specifically, the first aim will identify
microbial factor(s) that govern ocular colonization by testing eight C. mast mutants that were
predicted to lack an ability to colonize the eye. The second aim will discover microbial factor(s)
that stimulate host immunity by assessing immunogenicity, in vitro and in vivo, of nine different C.
mast mutants that were predicted to have a limited ability to induce immune responses. The third
aim will mechanistically define how ocular commensal bacteria stimulate the human immune
response. As outlined, the proposed studies will provide multiple layers of information beneficial
to ocular health. First, Aims 1 and 2 will provide the identity of specific genes that play a critical
role in the nature of an ocular commensal, which will allow future studies to better distinguish true
ocular commensals from other bacteria that are temporarily introduced to the eye. These aims
will also shed light on genes that may be desirable in the formulation of genetically modified ocular
bacteria or ocular probiotics. Finally, Aim 3 will provide valuable knowledge on a virtually unknown
area, which is the human immune response against Corynebacterium spp. Because
Corynebacteria are fairly ubiquitous throughout the body, these data will have far-reaching
implications for not only the eye, but throughout the rest of the body. In sum, the proposed studies
will form the foundation for the future development of ocular probiotics to treat eye diseases."

BACKGROUND: Hematological malignancies (HM) are rare cancers that affect the blood and lymph system
and can only be cured with transplantation of donor stem cells; namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT). While advancements have improved outcomes for younger and otherwise healthy
patients, HCT can have devastating effects on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for older and
medically infirm (vulnerable) patients with HM. We were the first to develop an HCT-specific comorbidity index
(HCT-CI) that specifically showed that those with high scores can suffer from significant impairments in
HRQOL and higher rates of morbidity and mortality after HCT compared to patients with lower comorbidity
scores. Guided by our and others’ preliminary studies, we propose here to randomize those vulnerable patients
between supportive and palliative care, clinical management targeting specific comorbidities, both approaches
combined, vs. standard of care (SOC) to see which intervention can improve HRQOL of those patients after
HCT. OBJECTIVES: (1) Evaluate in a randomized phase II study the effectiveness of the four approaches
mentioned above in improving day-90 HRQOL for vulnerable recipients of allogeneic HCT; (2) determine in a
phase III study whether the winner arm from phase II definitively improves HRQOL vs. SOC; and (3) compare
the interventions with respect to survival, additional patient-reported outcomes, and the use of resources.
METHODS: We will conduct a multi-center seamless phase II/III randomized clinical trial in five large transplant
centers. The seamless feature means patients used in the phase II analysis will be included in the phase III
analysis but that will only happen if phase II produces an intervention with a clear advantage over SOC. In Aim
1, we will enroll 300 patients who either have age of ≥65 years, HCT-CI scores of ≥3, and/or slow walk speed
as indication of frailty, two weeks before they start their allogeneic HCT. Each intervention arm will be
implemented over 10 weeks period, 2 weeks before and 8 weeks after HCT, to achieve the maximum benefit in
preparing patients for HCT and guiding them through the early phases of the procedure. Patients will be
randomly assigned to one of the four arms described above. If there is an intervention arm from phase II that
improves HRQOL, then we will continue to test that arm only against SOC in a phase III study. We will only
need an additional 300 vulnerable patients for phase III (total of 600 for phase II/III). In Aim 3, we will see if any
of the interventions can improve survival, other patient-reported outcomes, and/or the use of resources.
PATIENT OUTCOMES: This proposal is the first to compare these peri-transplant interventions in vulnerable
HM patients given HCT. Results can minimize the suffering and, if possible, prolong the lives of similar patients
in the future and world-wide. Results could also encourage physicians to offer transplants to more vulnerable
patients, who are currently being denied the procedure for fear of its morbidity and mortality risks. Finally, the
national overall use of healthcare resources could be improved for the benefit of other patients."
10849683,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to define the role of neutrophil-specific NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) in alcoholic
liver
disease(ALD) and to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. ALD affectsmore than 10 million people in
the U.S. and accounts for nearly half of liver cirrhosis-associated deaths. Understanding the pathogenesis of
ALD is imperative for the development of effective therapies. Neutrophil accumulation in the liver is a hallmark
for ALD. Evidence suggests that neutrophils are a key contributor to ALD. However, better understanding of
molecular pathways important in regulating neutrophil functions is required to target these cells for ALD
treatment. It is recently revealed that the activity and expression levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX)2, a major
source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were dramatically reduced in neutrophils from patients with
advanced alcoholic cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis. Although ROS has been associated with inflammation,
mounting evidence also suggests that NOX2-derived ROS actually plays a critical role in limiting, rather than
promoting, inflammatory responses. Given the paradoxical role of NOX2, this proposal aims to fill the
knowledge gaps regarding whether and how NOX2 regulates neutrophil functions.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that mice with neutrophil-specific deletion of NOX2 develop exacerbated
liver injury and prolonged inflammation after chronic plus binge ethanol treatment. NOX2-deficient neutrophils
release much higher levels of IL-1 than WT-neutrophils. Together these findings led to our hypothesis that
neutrophil-specific NOX2 plays a critical role in limiting inflammation and promoting resolution of
inflammation during ALD. We propose three Specific Aims to (1) elucidate the mechanism accounting for
increased IL-1 production by NOX2-deficient neutrophils during ALD, (2) investigate the role of neutrophil-
specific NOX2 in the resolution of inflammation during ALD, (3) evaluate the potential of targeting neutrophil-
specific NOX2 to treat ALD."

The combination of metal ions with proteins offers unique chemical reactivities that are at the heart of many of
Nature’s most important and amazing chemical transformations. For example, metalloenzymes catalyze the
reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a rate-limiting step in DNA biosynthesis. They
biosynthesize anticancer and antiviral compounds that have unusual scaffolds and catalyze the carbon-carbon
bond forming reactions that afford life on CO2 and H2 gases. Our lab employs structural methods to interrogate
how metalloenzymes are able to perform this incredible chemistry. We seek to understand how the
architecture of metalloenzymes allows for radical species to be controlled – i.e. turned off, turned on and
harnessed – to enable the reaction at hand. We also strive to understand how proteins are designed to enable
long-range electron transfer without protein damage or radical loss. In this proposal, we describe structural
studies of our metalloenzyme model systems, including class Ia (diiron-dependent) and class III (glycyl radical-
dependent) ribonucleotide reductases that allow us to interrogate the molecular basis of radical-based
chemistry. We also describe efforts to understand how protein scaffolds facilitate organometallic chemistry,
especially in regard to microbial carbon dioxide fixation and methane production. These studies leverage both
our expertise in working with O2-sensitive metalloenzymes and in cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
Although we will continue to employ X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM is proving to be a game-changer for many
of our metalloenzyme systems. In particular, the resolution revolution of cryo-EM provides us with the means to
obtain long-awaited structures of both large (2000 kDa) and transient metalloprotein complexes and to
determine structures of metalloenzymes in functionally-essential conformational states that were previously
unattainable by crystallography. The results of our structural studies will enable structure-based design of
novel antibiotics targeting, for example, microbial ribonucleotide reductases. These structural data will also
guide efforts to exploit radical enzymes for the production of medically important compounds with unusual
scaffolds. These data will additionally facilitate the application of metalloenzymes or their bioinspired inorganic
counterparts in the production of high-value carbon compounds from the greenhouse gas CO2 and, ideally,
improve our understanding of some of the more enigmatic aspects of metalloprotein biochemistry."
10850964,"Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, with 1.8 million cases and 600 thousand cancer
deaths projected for 2020. Substantial progress in cancer treatment has been made in the past two decades,
largely through the development of highly targeted therapies, including development of antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs). ADCs employ monoclonal antibodies with specificity for tumor-associated antigens to increase the
efficiency and selectivity of the delivery of anti-cancer toxins (i.e., payloads) to cancer cells. Although this
approach has proven to be successful, with 9 anti-cancer ADCs approved for use in the US (brentuximab vedotin,
trastuzumab emtansine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, inotuzumab ozogamicin, polatuzumab vedotin, enfortumab
vedotin, belantamab mafodotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan), ADC therapies are often
associated with substantial off-target toxicity, narrow therapeutic windows, and high failure rates in clinical
testing. This project introduces a new pharmacokinetic strategy to increase the tumor-selectivity of antibody-
directed delivery of anti-cancer drugs. In our approach, payload-binding antibody fragments, termed payload-
binding selectivity enhancers (PBSE), are co-administered with ADCs to decrease the exposure of healthy
tissues to payload agents, thereby reducing the development of off-target toxicity, increasing the tolerable dose
of ADCs, and increasing ADC efficacy. The strategy is based on the recognition that off-site ADC toxicity is
primarily attributed to the released (“free”) payload molecule, and also on the hypothesis that PBSE may be
employed to prevent cellular entry of free payload molecules in non-targeted cells (by preventing diffusion across
plasma membranes) without altering entry of ADCs into targeted cells (which proceeds via receptor mediated
endocytosis). Work in this project will focus on the development and evaluation of a novel series of PBSE that
have been shown to decrease the cytotoxicity of free SN38 and Dxd. These agents are camptothecin derivatives
that are employed as payloads for sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan, two recently approved
ADC molecules that have shown some efficacy, but substantial toxicity, in clinical investigations. Mechanistic
studies proposed in Aim #1 and Aim #2 examine relationships between PBSE molecular attributes (e.g., affinity,
molecular modality [i.e., IgG, Fab, scFv, sdAb], selectivity for unconjugated payload, molecular charge, etc.) and
PBSE utility in enhancing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic selectivity of ADC therapy. These findings
will be integrated through the use of mechanistic mathematical modeling to assist in the selection of an optimal

Through this K23 award, the candidate, an infectious disease physician with advanced training in tuberculosis
(TB) and global TB/HIV research, will become an independent physician-scientist bridging clinical and
molecular epidemiology and drug-resistance genomics. The candidate’s long-term goal is to improve our
understanding of the relationship between HIV, drug-resistant TB mutations, TB transmission and clinical
outcomes in order to better target interventions and guide treatment. To meet these goals, the candidate
requires: 1) Skills in the analysis of large clinical cohorts; 2) Fluency with existing molecular epidemiology
analysis and modelling; 3) Working knowledge of next generation sequencing techniques and analysis
pipelines; 4) Experience in the recruitment and management of prospective clinical cohorts; 5) Professional
development and preparation for extramural funding. This K23 outlines a 5-year plan of coursework, hands on
training, and assembles a multidisciplinary mentorship team to address these competencies. Dr. Karen
Jacobson (primary mentor) has over 10 years’ experience conducting international tuberculosis studies and a
successful NIH-funded grant portfolio. Prof. Robin Warren and Dr. David Engelthaler (co-mentors) are experts
in Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance and next generation sequencing techniques, respectively. Drs.
C. Robert Horsburgh and Laura White (advisors), together with Prof. Helen Cox (advisor) will provide clinical
and molecular epidemiology expertise along with biostatistical modelling support. This K23 will address our
lack of understanding of the association between HIV and rifampin-resistant/multidrug-resistant TB (RR/MDR-
TB). The candidate will leverage a bank of RR/MDR-TB specimens from the Western Cape Province, South
Africa, to examine how transmitted and acquired TB drug resistance varies over a twelve-year period among
people living with and without HIV (aim 1). Next, the role of TB drug-resistance compensating mutations in
RR/MDR-TB transmission at the community-level will be examined in a retrospective cohort in Worcester,
South Africa, including the impact of HIV and other risk factors (aim 2). Finally, in a prospective pilot cohort,
whole genome and next generation sequencing techniques will be used to examine whether TB drug
resistance evolves differently during TB treatment in people with and without HIV, and in those presenting on
and off antiretroviral therapy in Worcester, South Africa (aim 3). Knowledge gained from this study will translate
into interventions to decrease the risk of RR/MDR-TB infection and improve long-term outcomes for people
with HIV. By building upon her prior research experience and training, utilizing the biobank of RR/MDR-TB
specimens and a well-established research site, along with methodologic training and expert mentorship, the
candidate is well positioned to accomplish the proposed training and research aims and to then apply for an
R01 award focused on exploring evolution of TB drug resistance in high burden TB/HIV coinfection settings."

Our long-term goal remains the same and targets to develop human liver tissue model from stem cells, with
multi-cellular cues, metabolic functionality, that incorporates dynamic genetic and epigenetic factors and
encompasses the spectrum and evolution of human NAFLD to uncover disease mechanism and therapeutics.
The objectives of the proposed study are to continue developing human fatty livers engineered with iPS cells,
that incorporates the dynamic expression of the epigenetic-related histone modification SIRT1 in different
genetic polymorphisms and elucidate their role as metabolic regulators in the development of human fatty liver
disease. The central hypothesis to be tested here is that genetic polymorphisms especially the NAFLD-high-
risk PNPLA3 rs738409, combined with epigenetic-related changes (SIRT1) can control hepatic metabolism
and contribute to the development of human fatty liver. The rationale is that the ability to generate human
diseased liver tissue using genetically modifiable iPS cells from different human populations with single-
nucleotide-polymorphisms is a powerful resource, that now make it possible, for the first time, to functionally
interrogate their role in disease. Importantly, based on our strong preliminary data of targeted metabolomic
analysis in isolated human hepatocytes obtained from either liver resections “Normal Human Hepatocytes” or
hepatocytes isolated from explanted NASH livers “NASH Human Hepatocytes” carrying either the NAFLD-high
risk PNPLA3 I148M genetic variant or wild type we hypothesize that PNPLA3 I148M hepatocytes have high
levels of ferroptosis thereby leading to low metabolic capacity to adapt to stressors and continuous loss of
hepatocytes. In the newly proposed aim3, we aim to uncover ferroptosis based therapeutic strategies for
patients with NAFLD-high risk PNPLA3 I148M genetic variants.
The work described here is expected to i) generate human iPS cells carrying shRNA mediated conditional
knockdown of SIRT1 in different genetic backgrounds (especially the NAFLD-high-risk PNPLA3 rs738409
variant), ii) develop a novel approach for modeling an organ-like environment to determine the role of the
epigenetic related factor SIRT1 and the genetic variants in the development of fibrotic human mini-livers with
fatty liver disease and iii) determine the role of genetic polymorphisms in regulating functional metabolism in
mini-human iPS-derived liver tissue with fatty liver disease with especial focus on ferroptosis. Understanding
this process alone or in relation to epigenetic changes in a human liver tissue model can result in preventive
therapeutic strategies for patients with NAFLD-high risk PNPLA3 I148M genetic variants. The results of this
work will also have a positive impact by establishing the basis and platform for future sophisticated organ
engineering techniques that incorporates several different cell types from the same iPS cell source, these
techniques could be applied to study other liver diseases (e.g. metabolic diseases) and is expected to be a
major contribution to the fields of stem cells engineering and liver steatosis."

Aberrant ocular neovascularization contribute to blindness in numerous conditions including age-
related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity.
DICER1 is a RNase that processes micro-RNAs and SINE RNAs. Deficiency of DICER1 is
implicated in outer retinal pathologies, including choroidal neovascularization. This claim is
supported by recently published studies finding that multiple models of DICER1 deficiency
develop aberrant choroidal neovascularization in mice, and new evidence that DICER1
expression is significantly reduced in human neovascular AMD. However, major gaps in
knowledge persist with respect to the relative contributions of major DICER1 substrate classes
micro-RNA and SINE RNA imbalances as contributors to choroidal neovascularization. In
addition, whether DICER1 deficiency impedes conventional gene silencing strategies, and the
role of DICER1 in age-related neovascular pathologies are unknown. The overall hypothesis of
this project is that age-related DICER1 deficiency drives chorioretinal neovascularization via SINE
RNA accumulation and impedes conventional gene silencing strategies. We will test this
hypothesis in three specific aims. 1) We will distinguish between the contributions of micro-RNA
and SINE RNA-dependent processing activities of DICER1 with respect to development and
severity of CNV. 2) We will adapt DICER1-independent gene silencing strategies and compare
them to traditional DICER1-dependent strategies in models of CNV. 3) We will quantify DICER1
in aging retina, and determine whether ectopic DICER1 expression improves CNV outcomes in
aged animals. Collectively, these thematically related, but independent aims will establish new
foundational and translationally relevant knowledge about the mediators and consequences of
DICER1 deficiency in pathological choroidal neovascularization. These studies may thereby open
new interventional avenues for prevalent blinding conditions."

 Training at the chemistry biology interface at Johns Hopkins University will be made possible by
an independent Ph.D.-granting program that will nucleate a vibrant community of 31 faculty spanning
4 schools and 9 departments. Together, these faculty share a common approach of applying chemical
principles and methods to problems of profound importance to biology and medicine. The program
offers opportunities to develop research skills applicable over a wide range of dimensions, from single
molecules to complex macromolecular assemblies to whole cells. Laboratories are well funded and
focus on mentoring graduate students in rigorous, ethical and independent design and interpretation
of experiments in preparation for leadership roles in biomedical research. The highly collaborative
nature of Johns Hopkins provides students with access to many faculty and a robust infrastructure
of instrumentation and expertise.
 Prospective students will be actively recruited from across the country to generate a highly
qualified pool of applicants that draw from small colleges, large universities, minority serving
institutions and historically black colleges and universities. Admission relies on a holistic review of
applicants' dedication to science, research experience, perseverance and academic success within the
context of available opportunities. Both diversity and inclusion are core values of this program. A
target of seven students will matriculate annually with support from the training grant. A matching
number of positions will be provided by the university to support students in their second year before
obtaining fellowships and assistantships for the remainder of the program. Annual cohorts will share
a common core curriculum created to reinforce a strong foundation in chemistry while building an
aptitude for the biological sciences through a rich selection of electives. A series of three laboratory
rotations across different departments will ensure a breadth of experience in research prior to
selection of a thesis advisor. Students will join together monthly for meetings on research and
professional topics and yearly for student-hosted seminars and a retreat.
 Training progress of each student will be monitored carefully by a thesis committee to assure a
growing proficiency in independent and reproducible experimental design, keen observation, precise
data analysis and critical interpretation. Professional development will be enriched by a new course
in literature evaluation, proposal writing and public presentation and another course on career
planning. The goals of this train program foster original research contributions of high impact while
preparing young scientists for sustained success in their chosen career related to research."

 The California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) is one of 23 campuses of the California State
University (CSU) system, the largest 4-year public university system in the US. Designated a Hispanic Serving
Institution (HSI) since 2005 and an Asian American, Native American and Pacific Islander Serving Institution
(AANAPISI) since 2011, it is committed to effectively serve the socioeconomically diverse urban populations in
southern California. It has been highly successful in attracting, retaining and graduating underrepresented and
underserved (UR/US) students and provides an ideal environment for identifying and fostering the growth of a
diverse group of students who are interested in future academic careers in biomedical research.
 The mission of the current CSULB Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student
Enhancement (U-RISE) (T34) proposal is to increase diversity in future scientific and biomedical research by
training undergraduate (UG) students to enter and succeed in graduate programs and beyond. The rationale
for the proposed program is that the university has a rich pool of UG students from diverse backgrounds, and a
large pool of faculty members conducting high quality research funded by federal and private programs, with
UGs as frontline researchers being a brand name for the university. Further, CSULB was recently re-classified
as an R2 university with high research activity as per Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education
and as a research-active university based on the NIH definition of eligibility tracks for funding of diversity
enhancing programs. The university has ~30 years track record of integrating research into education, with
students supported through diversity training programs such as the NIH MARC and RISE. The last 5-year
record shows ~80% of CSULB MARC and RISE trainees entered graduate programs. More recently the
BUILD program further laid the groundwork for UG research work led by faculty members who have been
increasingly adopting best mentoring practices by undergoing training as part of Advancing Inclusive Mentoring
(AIM) program. Together, these programs inform the current U-RISE proposal of effective mentoring practices
for training UR/US students in research.
 The design of the CSULB U-RISE program involves training 24 UG students (at any given point during
the five-year cycle) from diverse backgrounds in research over a two-year period. Scholars with high academic
record and research interest and who have two years left to graduation in their academic status (typically in
their junior year), and those bearing high potential for research and demonstrating resilience and persistence
will be recruited and trained to be competitive and successful in graduate school. The objectives of the
program are to offer: i) elevated research-infused academic education, ii) immersive research experience, and
iii) graduate school preparation and professional development activities.
 Key activities that promote skills development include: i) trainees undertaking courses involving
directed reading and research, scientific research communication and seminars, graduate level and advanced
research methodology courses; ii) trainees participating in authentic intramural research experience with a
CSULB faculty mentor during their two years of training and extramural research for ~ 8 weeks during year 2 of
their training in a research-intensive PhD-offering environment, and, iii) trainees engaged in various
professional development activities to develop soft skills to succeed in graduate school through mandatory
weekly learning community meetings on topics such as research careers, resumes and statement of purpose
and graduate programs. The intended trainee outcomes are presentations at U-RISE Scholars Committee of
faculty members, at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students and at national
conferences in their individual discipline, participation in manuscript preparation as co-authors for publication in
peer reviewed journals at the discretion of their faculty mentors. A major outcome of this preparation is
entering, successfully transitioning into and completing biomedical higher degree graduate programs.
Throughout this experience the importance of responsible conduct of research and, rigor and transparency in
biomedical research will be emphasized.
 Taken together, these experiences are expected to infuse social and scientific values, enhance the
academic skills, confer research skills, foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills, develop the scholars
professionally. The significance of the CSULB U-RISE program lies in its training components that prepares
the scholars and trains the mentors in best mentoring practices. The innovative aspect of the program stems
from its core practice of collaboration between faculty members who have undergone AIM training, social
scientists, administrators, and evaluator to provide UG students training. Their feedback allows the program
personnel to attenuate and respond rapidly with thoughtful interventions, and to enable the students to build
their scientific identity and to respond to evolving issues and trainee needs. The CSULB U-RISE program will
develop the overall intellectual, professional and leadership abilities of participating trainees, with an overall
goal of achieving equity, diversity, and inclusiveness in biomedical research careers."

This new T32 application entitled Research Training in Systems Skin Biology is a combined pre- and post-
doctoral training program (MPIs Kim and Millar Co-PDs). The rationale for this proposal is that Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) has a track record of success in dermatology, skin immunology, and epithelial
biology such that it can leverage additional institutional strengths (e.g., neuroscience, translational medicine,
etc.) to build an interdisciplinary training program in Systems Skin Biology. The central hypothesis is that such
intersectional science is critically important for the training of future scientists within single organ systems like
the skin. Finally, there is a major gap in our ability to train physician-scientist in a formalized manner which this
T32 would provide a platform to do successfully. The overall objective of this program is to attract and train
talented MD/PhD and PhD students and postdocs over 2 year periods, for successful, independent careers in
Systems Skin Biology relevant to human disease. We have a diverse, well-funded faculty with broad interests in
Systems Skin Biology in immunology and a strong pool of pre- and post-doc trainees that includes significant
numbers of underrepresented in science (UiS) minorities. The program is designed to provide training by
individual mentors performing research in all aspects of Systems Skin Biology relevant to human disease. The
program is supported with strong oversight and administrative structure, significant didactic training in Systems
Skin Biology, scientific writing and career development, and contains newly added state of the art evaluation
approaches with defined goals and benchmarks for success so as to optimize the development of independent
academic researchers in the field. The long-term goal of this program is to produce 1 MD/PhD or PhD scientist
in investigative dermatology/skin biology research every 2 years who become independently funded via a K or
R mechanism."

The complex problems encountered across length and time scales in treating disease require a broad repertoire
of skills along with the capacity to harness teams possessing a range of diverse expertise to advance the
discovery of new therapeutics and diagnostics. To address the pressing public health needs of the 21st century,
the next generation of researchers must be able to think and communicate in a common language that spans
chemistry and biology. The mission of the proposed Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Predoctoral Training
Program at Northwestern University is to recruit, train and advance a diverse cohort of students who are
prepared to lead the next wave of innovation and discovery at the interface of chemistry and biology.
The CLP Training Program will address multiple dimensions of the training ecosystem and is aligned with NIGMS
goals for predoctoral training: student-centered skills acquisition, trainee wellness and retention, mentor
development, diversity, equity and inclusion, and assessment and improvement. The CLP Program will
provide students with the opportunity to integrate graduate studies in chemistry and the life sciences to a degree
beyond that of any training program at Northwestern University. The program is built upon the highly collaborative
research programs of 52 mentors with extensive expertise in the areas of drug development, diagnostics,
biomimetic molecules, and potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The depth and breadth of its
coursework requirements, novel immersive cross-disciplinary lab experience, and unique mentoring structure,
coupled with a strong shared training environment, set this program apart from other Northwestern biomedical
training programs. The CLP Training Program also provides an intense focus on career development through
activities and programs that will expose trainees to alternative career pathways, facilitate networking with
potential mentors, and foster key competencies in communications, resume development, and leadership. The
evidence-based training methods and approaches developed by the CLP Program will be shared with graduate
programs at Northwestern and across the country with the goal of maximizing the impact of program innovations
and contributing to the development of 21st century graduate STEM education.
This application requests support for 8 slots/year (Year 1; 7 slots), for a total of 39 slots over 5 years to create a
vibrant cohort of peers with a common identity. Trainees are appointed to the grant starting in the fall of their
second year and are supported throughout their second and third years of graduate education. Ten additional
students will be supported by one-year university fellowships, enabling the participation of well-qualified and
diverse international students. The program deploys a team-based approach to program leadership that
leverages the unique expertise of its members and the administrative capabilities of the Chemistry of Life
Processes Institute to enhance program development, assessment and evaluation, and training."
10805423,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This application is a competitive renewal of the University of Michigan's Program for Scientist Training in
Rheumatology Research (T32AR007080). Our Program, funded by NIAMS since 1975, is designed to
prepare four outstanding postdoctoral scientists per year, both MD and PhD, for investigative careers in
research related to the rheumatic diseases. Our Program is motivated by several key factors including (i) the
tremendous clinical need caused by the unrelenting burden of rheumatic diseases; (ii) an appreciation that
rheumatic diseases are propelled by complex processes in need of multidisciplinary approaches; and (iii) a
threatened pipeline of diverse investigators committed to careers that will be devoted to rheumatology
research. Fortunately, recent advances in biomedical and clinical sciences have created unprecedented
research opportunities to understand disease etiologies more deeply—and ultimately improve outcomes
through an approach personalized to the care of each individual living with a rheumatic disease. Our 22
Program faculty mentors are dedicated researcher-mentors who together bring broad interdisciplinary
expertise focused on rheumatic diseases. These investigators have established extensive collaborations with
research units nationally and internationally to effectively study rheumatic disease mechanisms and improve
management. Leveraging these historical strengths, our Program's themes have been updated to align with
NIAMS strategic mission “to transcend disease- and tissue-specific boundaries via cross-cutting scientific
themes.” For the upcoming cycle of our Program, major scientific themes will include (i) Biologic Underpinnings
of Clinical Heterogeneity; (ii) Immunological Mechanisms of Disease; (iii) Injury, Repair, and Fibrosis; and (iv)
Patient Outcomes/Experience and Innovative Trials. Trainees are also provided strong roots in the ethical
conduction of research, and in embracing a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Some additional
highlights of the Training Program include: (i) the availability of an award-winning 10-week research training
course offered to physician trainees with a strong interest in basic research; (ii) multiple paths for trainees to
earn a master's degree concurrent with their Program training, and (iii) outstanding state-of-the-art biomedical
cores that provide training, consultations, and scientific services commensurate with U-M's standing as the top
public research institution in the United States. It has been a longstanding mission of our Program to train
individuals from diverse backgrounds for careers in research. Of the 26 trainees since 2009, 17 (65%) are
women and eight (31%) come from underrepresented backgrounds (1 Black, 5 Hispanic or Latinx, and
2 from disadvantaged backgrounds); half of the current trainees identify as underrepresented minorities. Of
the 20 trainees (9 MD and 11 PhD) who have completed their participation in our Program since 2011, all 20
remain involved in research. Fourteen of the 20 (70%) are working in research-intensive careers, and ten have
successfully competed for grant funding (~70 grants have been awarded to the group as PI)."

Health disparities in the United States are large and historically rooted, begin early in life, and often persist
throughout the life course. The Health Disparities Research Scholars Program is an interdisciplinary postdoctoral
training program located in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin School
of Medicine and Public Health. It is designed to support the career development of health disparities researchers
and has two primary goals: 1) to develop a cadre of researchers who will work to advance knowledge of the
causes, consequences, and effective mitigation of disparities in health experienced by minority populations early
in and throughout the life course; and 2) to attract, retain, and support the development of a diverse set of health
disparities investigators as they embark on research careers dedicated to improving health equity. To achieve
these goals, we will actively recruit a diverse cadre of scholars who are committed to careers in health disparities
research and provide them with two or three years of training and support. We will recruit from doctorate
programs scholars who are ready to build on the methods of their graduate disciplines, cross boundaries, and
draw from content, theory, and methods of other fields. We have assembled an exceptional and diverse core
faculty with expertise across medical, population health, social/behavioral, and basic sciences. There are five
training components to the training program: i. a multidisciplinary mentor team; ii. a weekly Health Disparities
Research Scholars seminar and the opportunity to attend others on campus; iii. coursework, workshops, and
optional degree programs; iv. mentored research; and v. professional development activities. Through this
interdisciplinary training program, we will build key competencies and provide professional mentoring to facilitate
the success of our scholars as independent health disparities researchers. Scholar activities will be tracked
through quarterly progress reports, biannual mentor team meetings, and an annual formal evaluation of each
scholar. These assessments will enable the Program Director and mentor team to provide timely guidance and
identify strategies to ensure productivity and achievement of career goals."
10890585,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Small molecule and protein signals provide a rich vocabulary for cellular communication. The production and
consequences of these signals are exquisitely sensitive to cellular context and microenvironment. Dissecting the
molecular dialogue between cell types is challenging, and new methods are required to address fundamental
questions: What is the downstream biological function of each signaling molecule? How is the biological function
different when molecules are present in mixtures or when different cell types are present in the
microenvironment? How do microbes—like the bacteria and fungi present in our bodies—affect the molecular
landscape? Our lab is developing new tools to probe these questions including (1) microscale co- and
multiculture methods that enable precise positioning of cell types to study cell signaling, (2) specialized culture
platforms for complex human-bacteria-fungal multikingdom culture, (3) integration of microbial co- and
multiculture systems with volatile organic compound (VOC) sampling to study how volatiles mediate microbial
dialogue, and (4) at-home biofluid sampling and stabilization platforms to probe the human immune response
over time. The present proposal expands our lab’s capabilities in areas (1) and (3), with the possibility to extend
to (2) and (4) in future work. This proposal will probe unanswered questions in two areas of human cell signaling:
(i) paracrine signaling between eosinophils and fibroblasts and (ii) paracrine/physical contact-mediated signaling
between neutrophils, monocytes, and B cells. Further, we will develop novel culture platforms that enable
microbial and multikingdom (e.g., bacteria, fungi) VOC communication and integrated sampling for gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This culture system will, for the first time, enable
controlled spatial positioning of multiple microbial cultures, a user-friendly setup that can be operated with simple
pipettes, fluidic channels to deliver media and chemical stimulation, and integration of solid phase micoextraction
(SPME) fibers for VOC sample collection. Central to this proposal is the use of ‘open’ microfluidics and
spontaneous capillary flow. We are leaders in open microfluidics and have a strong track record of developing
user-friendly, cost-effective methods to perform microscale multiculture experiments within standard well plates
and cultureware familiar to biologists. The proposed work builds on our capabilities and embraces significant
engineering challenges in doing triculture with sensitive primary cells and innovating an entirely new approach
for study VOCs in microbial cultures. The proposed methods will enhance the understanding of the signals
involved in detrimental prolonged inflammation, critical to the development of better therapies for numerous
inflammatory conditions; they will also enable study of microbial communities that are essential to maintaining
human health (commensal microbes) and those that lead to disease (pathogens). Further, the bioengineering
and microfluidic approaches developed will translate to other biomimetic culture platforms and fundamental
signaling investigations."
10841540,"Project Summary
The human gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions of commensal microbes that collectively encode 150-fold
more genes than the human genome; between individuals, microbiome variation far exceeds genome
variation. Despite the possibility that the microbiome may represent a critical and readily modifiable component
of human biology, the contribution of the gut microbiota to health, disease risk, and response to therapy
remains largely undefined. The overall goal of our laboratory is to understand the principles, mechanisms, and
processes that shape the interaction between gut microbial communities and their hosts. Our strategy is to
combine anaerobic microbial genetics, high-throughput mass spectrometry, and gnotobiotic (germfree and ex-
germfree) animal models to dissect these interactions. In recent studies, we have used these approaches to
measure the contribution of the human gut microbiome to the metabolism of medical drugs and to define
cooperative, competitive, and antagonistic processes in the gut microbiome. Our progress in these areas
provides the basis for future studies centered on two themes. We will apply the metabolomic approaches we
developed for studying microbiome-mediated drug metabolism to xenobiotic compounds that aren't drugs,
including molecular components of food. Microbial genetic and gnotobiotic approaches also enable
investigation of how two processes that are not readily measured in microbiome surveys, within-host evolution
and phenotypic heterogeneity, contribute to host-microbiome interaction in the healthy and perturbed gut
environment. If successful, these studies will define causes and consequences of host-microbiome interaction
with broad implications for human health."
10621819,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA), a leading cause of chronic disability in the elderly population, occurs with the degradation of
the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, mainly composed of proteoglycan, collagen fibers, and water. Early
diagnosis of cartilage degeneration requires the detection of changes in proteoglycan concentration and collagen
integrity, preferably non-invasively and before any morphological changes occur. Spin-spin relaxation time (T2)
and spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1ρ) can provide quantitative information about the structure
and biochemical composition of the cartilage before morphological changes occur. Mono-exponential (ME)
models can characterize the T2 and T1ρ relaxation processes and map it for articular cartilage in the knee joint.
A recent meta-analysis showed that T1ρ provides more discrimination than T2 for OA. However, the ME model
alone cannot provide distinct information from different compartments of the cartilage. Recent studies have
shown that T1ρ relaxation might have bi-exponential (BE) components, following the hypothesis of the multi-
compartmental structure of the cartilage. BE T2 relaxation has shown better diagnostic performance than ME for
OA and can show the dispersion of the relaxation times, reflecting the heterogeneity in the macromolecular
environment of water in the cartilage. BE analysis of cartilage typically requires a larger number of acquisitions
with different spin-lock times (TSLs) or echo times (TEs), resulting in long scan time. High spatial resolution is
also needed to visualize the thin and curved cartilage and fine structures in the knee joint. As a result, in vivo
application of BE three-dimensional (3D) T1ρ and T2 mapping techniques is still very limited. Compressed sensing
(CS) combined with parallel imaging (PI) can accelerate acquisition and reduce the scan time required for ME
3D T1ρ and T2 mappings. T1ρ scans can be reduced from 30 min to ~3 min with an error smaller than 6.5%.
However, the error is two to three times larger for BE mapping. This problem can be potentially solved by
optimizing the sampling times (TSLs for T1ρ and TEs for T2) and the free parameters of the CS approach (k-
space sampling pattern, regularization function, regularization parameter, and minimization algorithm
parameters) using fully sampled 3D knee joint datasets, supported by machine learning tools. The overarching
goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and translate a high-spatial-resolution, rapid 3D magnetic resonance
imaging sequence using data-driven learning-based CS for assessment of the human knee joint and using ME
and BE 3D T1ρ (T2) mapping for improved biochemical characterization of cartilage and menisci on a standard
clinical 3T scanner."
10821472,"Studies from our current NHPCSG U19 revealed that induction with depletional thymoglobulin in
combination with maintenance with co-stimulation blockade plus rapamycin (ATG/CoB/Rapa) is a highly effective
regimen in repopulating the post-depletional lymphocyte repertoire with a naïve and CoB-sensitive phenotype.
In this application, we hypothesize that this newly repopulated repertoire is now susceptible to donor-specific
manipulation by an innovative cellular therapy using ECDI-treated, ex vivo expanded donor B cells to induce
donor-specific transplantation tolerance via donor-specific deletion, anergy and regulation. To test our
hypothesis, we will (1) deliver donor ECDI-B cells in the context of ATG/CoB/Rapa and determine its efficacy on
the induction of donor-specific tolerance; (2) apply the cutting-edge technology of rhesus macaque single cell
immune repertoire sequencing (scIRS) pioneered by our collaborator Dr. Peng at NCSU to investigate and
precisely quantify donor-specific deletion, anergy or regulation at a single cell level. As infections have been
brought into sharp focus by the recent SARS-CoV2 pandemic and have been shown to have a profound effect
on the susceptibility and stability of immune tolerance, we propose to further interrogate the interaction between
anti-viral immunity and donor-specific immune tolerance at a molecular level. We propose to use
cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a model pathogen as it is commonly encountered in transplant recipients. With these
goals in mind, we constructed three specific aims for this Project: Aim 1 will determine the efficacy of
transplantation tolerance by donor ECDI-B cell infusions in the presence of ATG/CoB/Rapa in rhesus kidney
transplantation, modeling both deceased donor as well as living donor kidney transplantation; Aim 2 will
determine the effect of CVM exposures on the induction and maintenance of transplantation tolerance in rhesus
macaques; and Aim 3 will employ cutting edge technologies including scIRS and the expertise in high-
dimensional data analytics provided by the CIC to examine lymphocyte repertoire and functionality under
tolerance conditions with or without concurrent CMV infection. At the completion of this project, we will: 1)
establish a clinically feasible and effective regimen for transplantation tolerance induction in rhesus macaques
using a combination of depletional induction and infusions of ECDI-fixed donor leukocytes; 2) understand the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of this tolerance approach; 3) determine the effective components of
therapeutic strategies to preserve transplantation tolerance in settings of unexpected viral infections. These
advances will ultimately position us to conduct a first-in-human kidney transplant tolerance trial testing the
optimized combinatorial regimen of donor ECDI-B cell infusions in the context of ATG/CoB/Rapa."

Mobile fishermen and their partners along Lake Victoria in western Kenya are a vulnerable population in need
of improved sexual and reproductive health (SRH)/HIV prevention efforts because of their high mobility, high
HIV prevalence, poor HIV care engagement, and high-risk sexual behaviors such as relationship concurrency
and a local transactional sex economy. Safer conception (SC) is a strategy to prevent HIV transmission and is
an entry point for life-long HIV prevention efforts, but current interventions to improve SC uptake have
neglected to address couple relationship dynamics (e.g. communication skills). This K01 proposal is to support
Dr. Sarah Gutin’s long-term career goal to become an independent social-behavioral scientist conducting
innovative research on engaging couples and promoting male engagement in SRH/HIV prevention services.
To achieve this career goal, and in collaboration with a dedicated mentorship team, Dr. Gutin proposes training
to: 1) gain knowledge of theories and research on the psychology of interpersonal relationships in mobile
populations; 2) develop mixed methods skills to collect, analyze, and integrate dyadic qualitative and
quantitative data; and 3) acquire couples-based behavioral intervention adaptation, implementation, and
analytic skills. The overall research objective is to adapt an innovative couples-based HIV prevention
intervention, ‘Jamii Bora’ and assess the interventions’ potential to promote male engagement for SC among
mobile couples. The specific aims are to: 1) identify dyadic-level barriers and facilitators to male engagement in
SC; 2) adapt the Jamii Bora intervention to improve male engagement in SC among Kenyan fisherfolk; and 3)
assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and implementation. Dyadic mixed methods will be used in Aim 1
including qualitative in-depth interviews, survey piloting, and a quantitative survey. In Aim 2, Dr. Gutin will
adapt the Jamii Bora couples’ intervention for fishermen and their primary female partners with feedback from
mobile couples and healthcare providers who will take part in separate intervention design workshops. In Aim
3, Dr. Gutin will conduct a preliminary assessment of the adapted intervention to evaluate feasibility and
acceptability. The proposed research will employ an innovative couples-based intervention approach to
improve relationship dynamics (e.g., communication) that are urgently needed to impact mobile couples’ SC
uptake and retention in SRH/HIV services. This integrated training and research plan will prepare Dr. Gutin to
launch an independent research career conducting couples research with varied populations and health
outcomes, and provide preliminary data for a pilot to test the couples’ intervention, followed by a randomized
trial with mobile couples. By focusing on research to improve the relationship context for couples
disproportionately burdened by HIV, it is possible to limit HIV transmission risks and improve long-term uptake
of SRH/HIV preventive behaviors and services."
10851715,"Synapses control information processing by the nervous system, and dysfunction of synapses is associated
with many neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. In all nervous systems, glutamate is the
primary excitatory neurotransmitter used to activate neurons. The goals of this study are to provide important,
new mechanistic insights into the function of glutamatergic synapses, which will aid in our understanding of
information processing by the brain and provide new avenues for the development of pharmaceutical therapies
for nervous system disorders. Using a genetic platform based on the nervous system of the model organism C.
elegans, we will study how peptide ligands, which signal via G-protein coupled receptors, regulate synaptic
function mediated by NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Synaptic NMDARs are involved in
the pathophysiology of numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders. We propose an integrated
multidisciplinary approach that combines in vivo electrophysiological analysis, behavioral studies and
optogenetic to study the mechanism of action by which specific neuropeptides regulate NMDAR-mediated
synaptic signaling. These studies have particular promise for a deeper understanding of nervous system
plasticity, and behaviors such as learning and memory. Our studies will reveal new targets for the development
of new drugs and novel therapeutic strategies for disorders of nervous system function."
10852824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial biofilms are communities of bacteria stuck together by a self-produced polymer matrix.
They exist in nearly every environment on earth and are the cause of most hospital-borne
infections. These adherent communities are highly tolerant of antibiotics and their extreme
resilience cannot merely be attributed to the inability of drug molecules to penetrate the biofilm
matrix. It has become clear that emergent, multicellular behaviors in biofilms impart unique
survival strategies. In recent years, we have learned detailed mechanisms of gene regulation
and phenotypic heterogeneity of single bacterial cells, but we have neither explored these
cellular phenomena in the context of crowded, multicellular biofilms, nor do we understand how
multicellular behaviors emerge from these single-cell properties. The goal of my lab for the next
five years will be to understand how single-cell properties and physics of the local environment
give rise to beneficial emergent behaviors in biofilms. With this MIRA award, my group will
explore these questions by focusing on two collective phenomena: 1) electrical cell-to-cell
communication and 2) emergence of patterns of motile and matrix-producing cells during biofilm
development. We will approach these problems using spatial gene expression measurements,
single-cell-level time-lapse imaging of biofilms, and novel transistor devices for electrical
perturbation of biofilms. To probe the emergence of group behaviors from single-cell properties,
we will use the experimental biofilm model species Bacillus subtilis to perturb known cell-to-cell
communication mechanisms and gene regulatory circuits. Our data will inform quantitative
models of multicellular phenomena, which will give us a system-level understanding of
multicellular behaviors in microbes, as well as suggesting new hypotheses and targets for
disrupting the emergent behaviors that allow biofilms to elude treatment."
10836991,"ABSTRACT
 Bacterial natural products have provided an immense source of therapeutic agents and driven innovation
in chemistry, biology, and pharmacology. In the past decade, it has become evident that the capacity of
bacteria to synthesize natural products was vastly underestimated. Advances in genome and transcriptome
sequencing combined with bioinformatic methods have shown that most biosynthetic genes are not
expressed or, at best, sparingly expressed during standard laboratory growth; their products are therefore not
synthesized at sufficient titers for detection and structural/functional characterization. These so-called ‘silent’
or ‘cryptic’ biosynthetic gene clusters outnumber constitutively active ones by a factor of 5-10. As such, they
represent a new dimension of bacterial metabolism, and unlocking it will allow access to a wealth of new
natural products and to deeper insights into microbial physiology and biochemistry.
 We recently contributed the High-Throughput Elicitor Screening (HiTES) methodology toward the
discovery of cryptic metabolites. In this approach, small molecule libraries are screened to identify inducers
of selected silent gene clusters. With elicitors identified, the cryptic metabolite and the regulation of the silent
cluster can be investigated. Several aspects of HiTES remain unexplored and they form the basis for the
current application: HiTES has only been applied to Burkholderia spp. and a few actinomycetes. Other prolific
genera have not yet been targeted. Moreover, the mechanism underlying HiTES remains to be determined.
Low-dose antibiotics have repeatedly been identified as the most effective elicitors, but the regulatory
pathways that underpin this response remain to be elucidated. In the current application, we seek address
these topics by expanding HiTES to prolific and understudied bacterial genera for the discovery of new, cryptic
natural products with desired biological activities, and by elucidating the mechanisms with which low-dose
antibiotics elicit cryptic metabolite biosynthesis, focusing on the β-lactam antibiotics and their stimulatory
effect on the model organism Burkholderia thailandensis. Collectively, these studies will shed light on an
emerging dimension of bacterial secondary metabolism, unearth new regulatory circuits that drive expression
of silent gene clusters, and provide novel natural products as possible therapeutic leads and sources of
biosynthetic and pharmacological investigations."

In this 5-year R01 project entitled “Mapping the superficial white matter connectome of the human brain using
ultra high resolution multi-contrast diffusion MRI,” we propose to create the first atlas of the human brain’s
superficial white matter (SWM) using sub-millimeter ultra high resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI). The SWM is
located between the deep white matter and the cortex. It plays an important role in neurodevelopment and aging,
and it has been implicated in a large number of diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, epilepsy, autism
spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Despite its significance in health and disease, the SWM
is vastly underrepresented in current descriptions of the human brain connectome. The SWM contains short, u-
shaped association fiber bundles called u-fibers. Multiple challenges have thus far prevented comprehensive
mapping of the human brain’s SWM. These challenges include the inadequate spatial resolution of dMRI data,
which prevents u-fiber tracing using current tractography methods, as well as the small size, high curvature, and
high inter-subject variability of the u-fibers. An additional challenge is the lack of ground truth information. Our
understanding of human neuroanatomy relies heavily on the results of invasive tracer studies in monkeys, but
the detailed neuroanatomy of the SWM in monkeys has not yet been systematically compiled or analyzed.
We propose to address these challenges to create the most comprehensive description of the SWM to date.
Our strategy includes using ultra high spatial resolution dMRI acquisitions (~700µm isotropic or better) at multiple
echo times (TE), novel dMRI tractography methods designed for tracing u-fibers, anatomically informed machine
learning to parcellate the u-fibers, and expert neuroanatomical generation of the SWM connectivity matrix from
monkey tracer studies. Furthermore, we will develop a novel ontological framework to organize and name the
SWM systems of the monkey and human brains. Overall, these steps will enable robust in-vivo tracing and
capturing of inter-subject variability of the SWM of the human brain at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Our
proposed deliverables will be the first comprehensive, anatomically curated atlases of the SWM in human and
monkey, which will enable the study of the SWM in health and disease. We will publicly release all image data,
tractography atlases, monkey connectivity matrices, extracted fascicles, and all software as open source."
10832040,"Our work focuses on post-transcriptional control of neural function with emphasis on translational control of
synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. We investigate the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
disorders that arise when this translation goes awry. We find that mis-regulated translation leads to changes in
alternative splicing and RNA degradation, which in turn contribute to neuropathology. More specifically, our
research is comprised of three distinct but complementary areas: (1) CPEB1 and cytoplasmic polyadenylation
control of translation; (2) FMRP regulation of translation with emphasis on ribosome stalling and codon usage;
(3) FMRP regulation of alternative splicing. CPEB1-regulated cytoplasmic polyadenylation governs translation
in post-synaptic compartments, which in turn modifies synaptic strength, the underlying cellular basis of learning
and memory. Molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral experiments from our laboratory have
demonstrated that CPEB1 regulates activity-dependent cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation, which
in turn modifies synaptic strength, and cognition. CPEB1 nucleates several proteins that promote poly(A) tail
growth and removal and mediate translation initiation; they also regulate plasticity and animal behavior. Another
RNA binding protein important for brain function is FMRP, the product of the Fragile X Syndrome gene FMR1.
FMRP binds >1000 RNAs in the brain and regulates translation, primarily by stalling ribosome translocation on
specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes the epigenetic factor SETD2, which catalyzes the chromatin mark
H3K36me3. In FMRP-deficient mouse brain, SETD2 levels are elevated and the H3K36me3 chromatin
landscape, which is principally located in gene bodies, is disrupted. H3K36me3 is linked to alternative pre-mRNA
splicing and there is widespread mis-regulation of splicing in FMRP knockout (KO) mice. The main objectives
our research going forward will address key unanswered questions regarding RNA regulation of neural function,
primarily using mouse models: (a) CPEB1-deficiency rescues Fragile X pathophysiology in FMRP KO mice.
Does this rescue involve ribosome stalling and/or polyadenylation? (b) CPEB1 also regulates 3’UTR length.
What is the mechanism by which this occurs? (c) How does FMRP stall ribosomes on specific mRNAs? Does
FMRP act as a molecular roadblock to ribosome transit and/or does FMRP interact with the ribosome? (d) How
does FMRP regulate alternative splicing? Some of the mis-splicing events appear to involve H3K36me3, but
these are in the minority. Does FMRP regulate the translation of mRNAs encoding splicing factors, and/or does
FMRP, which is a shuttling protein, affect splicing directly? (e) How does FMRP employ codon optimality to
regulate translation and RNA stability? We will address these issues by ribosome profiling, which we modified to
distinguish between translocating and stalled ribosomes, and direct nanopore RNA sequencing, which yields
poly(A) tail size at near-nucleotide resolution as well as RNA isoforms that arise by alternative splicing. We will
deplete key regulatory factors from the mouse brain and assess synaptic function and animal behavior."

The Washington University MARC U-STAR Program seeks to be part of a larger national effort that promotes
diversity in scientific research and the scientific workforce. Teams composed of individuals from diverse
backgrounds typically outperform teams composed of individuals from similar backgrounds. For the United
States to remain the worldwide leader in research, it must realize the tremendous scientific potential inherent
within its diverse population, much of which currently lies untapped within the underrepresented and
underserved communities. By focusing on research, scientific presentation, and community, our program seeks
to unlock this scientific potential, and in doing so help change the face of the next generation of scientists.
This application requests funds to support ten trainees in our MARC Program. By driving excellence and
innovation in research-based education, our program's mission is to help underrepresented students
succeed in the lab and classroom, matriculate into top PhD and MD/PhD programs, and excel in them. We
focus on three goals to achieve this mission: to provide students top-notch research experiences; to train
them to think critically and to write and speak effectively about science; and to create a positive, personal,
and critical scientific community in which they thrive. We center our program around the research experience
and have developed ten activities that span the two-year, junior- and senior-level program and seek to create a
supportive community in which students obtain rigorous training in research and scientific presentation via
individualized training and critique.
Our MARC Program, which was created in 2008, occupies a unique educational niche within Washington
University. It is the only program that supports underrepresented students during both the academic year and
summer to carry out research. It also incorporates a university-funded, Pre-MARC summer research program
for students who just completed their first-year in college to allow them to experience research, often for the first
time, and to help recruit these students into the MARC Program at the end of their sophomore year. Positive
student feedback on the MARC program illustrates its importance in driving student success and developing a
community in which underrepresented students thrive, with a recent surge in student applications leading to a
quadrupling in program size made possible through additional financial support from diverse university sources."
10864835,"Abstract
The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and
cysteinyl-containing SPMs (CysSPMs) are produced in the lung to counter-regulate pro-phlogistic responses
and to promote resolution of lung inflammation, in part via activation of a pro-resolving subset of eosinophils.
 Although we are accustomed to viewing the increase in airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in
asthma as the result of an over-abundance of pro-inflammatory stimuli, the severity and duration of an asthma
exacerbation could also result from insufficient endogenous anti-inflammatory effectors. Cysteinyl leukotrienes
are well appreciated to play pro-phlogistic roles in asthma, but not all lipid mediators initiate inflammation.
There are now several families of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) that have been identified and
characterized in acute inflammation. These protective mediators are enzymatically derived from essential fatty
acids and serve as agonists at specific receptors to transduce cell type specific functional responses, including
in eosinophil subsets that are relevant in asthma. With several drugs already developed to block CysLT
formation or action, the notion that select endogenous lipid-derived mediators are generated to promote
resolution of asthmatic airway responses would turn conventional thinking on its head and identify CysSPMs
as natural pro-resolving mediators and novel templates for drug design.
 To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims to:
  Determine lung SPM and CysSPM production in acute and chronic allergic lung inflammation,
  Establish SPM and CysSPM actions in the resolution of lung inflammatory responses, and
  Define roles for lung eosinophil subsets in promoting inflammation resolution.
This proposal’s specific aims are directed towards uncovering basic mechanisms that govern the resolution of
allergic airway responses in health and disease."

impact on future advances in digestive disease research. The P&F Program provides funding that primarily
targets young investigators in the process of establishing their independent research careers, but also allows
established investigators to initiate innovative and promising pilot projects that could lead to substantial funding
for new lines of research relevant to digestive diseases.
The Specific Aims of the HDDC P&F Program are:
1. To support and encourage young investigators in digestive disease-related research who have not
previously held independent awards (Type I Awards).
2. To entice accomplished investigators from other fields who are not currently focused on digestive diseases
to apply new concepts and technical approaches to the digestive tract (Type II awards).
3. To enable established investigators already working in digestive disease-related research to initiate a
substantial, innovative change in the direction of their research (Type III awards).
These projects are selected through a rigorous review process focused on innovation, scientific merit and
potential for future, independent, digestive disease-related research funding. To eliminate potential conflicts of
interest, final funding decisions are made by the External Advisory Board. The success of P&F awardees has
been outstanding. Since 2006, 62 investigators have been supported by HDDC P&F grants. Of these, 58 (94
%) received independent funding related to the P&F award within 5 years of receipt, 59 (94%) continue to be
active in digestive disease-related research, and 17 of the 34 who over the years have remained at HDDC-

10899449,"Project Summary – Genetic Targeting Core
Substance use disorders (SUD) are characterized by dysregulation of brain circuitry that involves diminished
activity of the brain reward circuits, increased responsiveness of the stress circuits and impaired functioning of
the executive cortical circuits. Neural changes are observed in the basal ganglia, extended amygdala and
prefrontal cortical regions and encompass a wide range of endogenous neurotransmitters including dopamine,
opioid peptides, endocannabinoids, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), dynorphin, glutamate and others. It
implies that these maladaptations may be causally responsible for behavioral changes often observed in chronic
drug users, for example habit formation and compulsive drug taking, that further worsen the neuronal and
behavioral signs of SUD. Restoration of normal functioning of the brain circuits is therefore a desirable goal of
SUD therapies. However, the exact influence of chronic drug use on the addiction brain circuits and how
manipulation of these circuits could prevent or treat substance use disorders remains to be elucidated.
As part of the Center of Excellence in Addiction Studies, the Genetic Targeting Core (GT Core) will assist users
in obtaining preliminary data on neural mechanisms of addiction that will form basis for future NIDA grant
applications. The GT Core will provide services to target and manipulate the addiction circuits in a cell specific
and circuits specific manner using state-of-the-art genetic techniques, including optogenetics, chemogenetics
and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Optogenetic strategies use microbial-based light activated ion channels
(opsins) that allow fast neuronal activation (channelrhodopsins) or inhibition (halorhodopsins,
archaerhodopsins), while chemogenetic approaches use engineered ion channels (PSAMs) or G protein-
coupled receptors (DREADDs) that can be activated pharmacologicaly. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing allows direct
in vivo manipulation of the genome in rodents. The introduction of functional transgenes, such as opsins and
DREADDs or editing of native genes requires in vivo delivery and expression of genetic material in desired cells.
This is accomplished with viral or nonviral vector systems. Cell and circuit specificity can be further enhanced by
the use of a specific Cre-driver mouse line.
The GT Core will provide three main services to its users that correspond with the three Specific Aims: 1) assist
with the selection of gene targeting methods, including the choice of the transgenic mouse line, and the type of
viral vector; 2) optimize and implement gene delivery using high precision stereotaxic instruments; and 3) verify
the efficacy of gene targeting using fluorescent microscopy or protein and gene quantification techniques. The
GT Core will coordinate work with the Administrative, Behavioral and Neuroanalytical Cores to develop effective
experimental strategies that involve several Cores. The close collaboration between our Cores ensures high
expertise in all areas of the addiction research and will permit establishment of standardized outcome measures
emphasizing scientific rigor and reproducibility."
10899458,"Project Summary - Behavioral Core
Physical and/or emotional trauma are at the crux of the ongoing pain and opioid epidemics. The complex neural
circuitry implicated in pain and opioid misuse challenges our understanding of the underlying pathologies and
potential treatments. Cognition and decision-making are certainly impaired in patients with pain. However, the
opioids compounds used to treat patients with chronic pain, are themselves also associated with cognitive
impairment. Despite the recognition of opioid use disorder (OUD) as a cognitive disorder, the complex
neurochemical signaling driving this behavior in cognitive models of OUD remains unclear. We propose a
Behavioral Core to synergize the neuro-analytical measurements in Core 3 with the genetically-edited animals
in Core 2. This alliance will provide new meaningful insights into the mechanisms of opioid reward and addiction
and simultaneously verify new molecular targets and neural pathways underlying OUDs.
 The Behavioral Core will utilize the DSM-V definition of opioid used disorder (OUD) (i.e., ten major
behaviors ranging from inter- and intrapersonal dysfunction to physical and psychological difficulties resulting
from increased intake of opioids on a 0-10 scoring system) and apply these to animal behavioral tests to create
a similar scoring system for preclinical addiction studies for reliable clinical translational application. These
behaviors will be performed in coordination with Cores-2 and Core-3, to provide large data sets optimal for an
OUD analysis with bioinformatic and machine learning strategies. In addition, novel molecular targets, therapies
and neural networks will be studied to determine to what extent new interventions significantly reduce OUD, in
line with the NIH/NIDA mission. The Behavioral Core offer the following pre-established assays:
SA1- Establish preclinical models of addictive states that are representative of DSM-V criteria for OUDs.
SA2- Establish preclinical models of cognition for evaluation of consequences of opioid exposure.
SA3- Integrate OUD behavioral assessment with dynamic neurochemical collection.
 The escalating number of fatalities from the opioid epidemic necessitates both better interventions to
treat OUD and a better understanding of the neural circuits underlying opioid use and addiction. To address this
problem, our studies use preclinical animal models based on criteria from human OUD patients. Studies in the
Behavioral Core specifically target the circuitry underlying cognitive dysfunction in addictive states that promote
poor decision making, drug taking, maintenance and relapse. Our proposed experiments implement multiple
technical approaches that will allow for understanding of circuits mediating cognitive aspects of the addictive
state. The data generated from the Cores will ultimately lead to hypothesis driven NIH/NIDA research proposals,
peer-reviewed publications, national and international presentations and an electronic database system for the
scientific community that will speed the discovery of effective therapies for OUD."

The Pilot Research Project Core (PRP) provides grant support and advising services for scientists interested in
advancing the field of substance abuse. The Pilot Core will encourage applications from early-stage investigators
preparing for their first NIDA R01 proposal. The PRP will also work with applicants to match them with the many
technical services offered by the Center Cores. The Pilot Core will also support scientists developing new
technologies that advances addiction research. To these ends, we describe three pilot projects that are ready
for support and illustrate the focus of the PRP.
1) Do interactions between chronic pain and opioid exposure reduce cognitive flexibility? Drug abuse
often follows emotional and physical pain. Data from our group indicates that chronic pain reduces executive
function which can contribute to relapse. We hypothesize that chronic pain and previous exposure to opioids will
interact such that animals exposed to chronic pain and opioids will exhibit severely reduced executive function
and show evidence for relapse. We will test this hypothesis using Behavioral Core facilities, utilizing instrumental
tests of cognitive flexibility. These studies will provide key pilot data for a NIDA R01 proposal investigating
interactions between addiction, chronic pain, and executive function.
2) Wireless Stimulation and Photometric Measurement of Neural Activity in Mice: Technologies for the
selective stimulation/inhibition of neural subtypes are needed to establish the causal roles they play in addiction.
Traditional approaches use tethers connected to the animal that disrupt behavior and impair assessment of
addiction-associated behaviors. This project supports development of wireless technologies that integrate
optogenetic stimulation and photometry for measurement of neural activity without disrupting natural animal
behavior. We plan to use this device to stimulate and suppress neurons associated with addiction. These
technologies would benefit the Analytical and Behavioral Cores by eliminating the need for tethers during
measurement and stimulation. This project will use services provided by the Behavioral and Genetics Cores.
3) Simultaneous Measurement of Dopamine Release and Single-Unit Activity in Behaving Animals.
Dopamine release supports learning by triggering neuroplastic changes in cortical and striatal circuits. Addiction
may result from atypically large dopamine release that enhances learning of drug-associated cues. There is no
direct evidence for this theory as few methods exist for the simultaneous measurement of dopamine release and
single-unit activity. Our group developed such a system for use in anesthetized animals. The goal of this pilot
proposal is to adapt this system for routine use in awake and behaving animals, and to determine if functional
connections between neurons are enhanced by phasic dopamine release. Experiments will utilize services of
the Behavioral Core and preliminary data will be used for a planned NIDA proposal."
10834203,"Prion diseases are relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorders with death often within six months of
the onset of neurologic symptoms. Pathologic features include widespread extracellular prion aggregates,
spongiform degeneration, synaptic and neuronal loss, and severe astrogliosis and microgliosis. The structural
determinants of the prion protein (PrP) and endogenous co-factors that drive aggregation, govern prion
assembly, and impact aggregate spread through the central nervous system are unclear. A major goal of this
application is to define when and how the endogenous co-factor, heparan sulfate (HS), promotes fibril assembly
in the parenchyma and blood vessels and slows PrP clearance through the interstitial fluid using in vitro and in
vivo model systems. We have previously pursued a range of approaches using cell-based prion conversion
assays and newly generated transgenic and knock-in mouse models in collaboration with structural biologists to
define the mechanisms that underlie PrP self-assembly and species barriers to prion conversion. We discovered
using knock-in mouse models that N-linked glycans on PrP reduce spongiform degeneration, hinder plaque
formation, and repel HS binding. Further, we found that plaque-forming prions were composed of poorly
glycosylated, GPI-anchorless PrP bound to highly sulfated HS, underscoring the pivotal role of PrP post-
translational modifications in driving the aggregate conformation and disease phenotype. We also found that
reducing HS chain length decreases parenchymal plaque formation and prolongs survival. Finally, we identified
highly amyloidogenic segments in the PrP sequence that control cross species prion conversion, as the number
and location of glutamine and asparagine residues in PrP raise or lower the prion transmission barrier. In this
renewal, we aim to determine the PrP-HS interactions that promote prion aggregate assembly and accelerate
disease. We build on our long-standing observation that structural features of PrP, together with host
glycosaminoglycans, drive efficient prion conversion. First, we will genetically manipulate neuronal, astrocytic,
and endothelial HS chains and determine the impact on prion cell targets and survival using mouse models.
Second, we will define how endogenous HS regulates PrP clearance through the interstitial fluid using conditional
HS mouse models and radiolabeled PrP. Third, we will test the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
targeting HS biosynthetic enzymes or Prnp mRNA in the early and mid-stages of prion plaque development in a
prion disease model. We expect these mechanistic studies will (i) define how an endogenous co-factor, HS,
accelerates and modifies prion disease, and (ii) determine whether reducing PrP interactions with this potential
therapeutic target blocks prion spread."
10808175,"Preterm birth (PTB), or birth before 37 weeks of gestation, was the second leading cause of infant death in the US in 2017. Each year, more than $26 billion is spent on treatment and care of babies born prematurely, not accounting for the lifelong impact of developmental and cognitive impairments. Here, we focus on the most common cause of PTB, inflammation. Maternal inflammation triggers a pro-inflammatory cytokine response that can also lead to fetal inflammatory response syndrome and perinatal brain injury. Brain injury leads to a spectrum of adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, including cerebral palsy, autism, schizophrenia, and cognitive delay among others. The only approved drug for prevention of PTB is the synthetic progestin hydroxyprogesterone caproate (OHPC) dosed systemically as weekly injections in women with a singleton pregnancy with a history of singleton spontaneous PTB, and a recently failed confirmatory study has led to calls for the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market. For women that are already in preterm labor, off-label tocolytics (anti-contraction medications) may be given to slow uterine contractions, but this typically only delays birth for a few days. New, effective treatments for preventing PTB are desperately needed. Further, the vaginal route of administration is underexplored but highly promising; vaginally absorbed drug is preferentially transported to the uterus. We have demonstrated that by increasing mucosal drug penetration and eliminating hypertonic excipients that cause local toxicity, increased drug delivery to target reproductive tissues can be achieved. In the setting of intrauterine inflammation, we have observed that combining vaginal progesterone (P4) with drugs that favor non-laboring states of P4 receptor and gene expression, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), provides a significant increase in dams that go on to deliver live pups. In contrast, dosing the same drug combination systemically or injecting the approved product OHPC had no therapeutic effect. Analysis of gene expression changes suggest that quiescing myometrial activity was key, and we have confirmed that the myometrial tissue levels of P4 and HDACi measured after vaginal combination delivery in mice were also the most effective in preventing human myometrial cell contractility. Importantly, preliminary neurobehavioral analysis of pups born after exposure to intrauterine inflammation followed by vaginal P4/HDACi suggests that development occurred similar to pups that had not been exposed to intrauterine inflammation. Herein, we propose studies that build from exciting preliminary data using nanomedicine to address fundamental questions regarding route of administration, pharmacokinetics, as well as validating existing drug classes that may be reformulated and repurposed for improved targeting to the female reproductive tract. If these preclinical studies progress as expected, we will have identified novel, effective methods for prevention of inflammation-induced PTB that also support fetal and neonatal immunological programming and development."

My goal is to establish myself as an independent biostatistical researcher who develops and validates
prediction models that are critical to identifying older adults at high risk of adverse health outcomes using novel
machine learning methodology. My passion for developing prediction models for health outcomes in older
adults stems from my desire to help people, especially older adults who are vulnerable. I developed a machine
learning method called Binary Mixed Model (BiMM) forest, which is particularly suited for developing prediction
models for repeated measures of outcomes in older adults because it accommodates dynamic fluctuations
over time which are common in aging (e.g., functional status). Environment: Wake Forest School of Medicine
is a nationally-recognized leader in geriatric research and provides an outstanding environment for
accomplishing my goals. Mentors: I have an excellent interdisciplinary mentoring team consisting of experts in
aging, biostatistics and informatics who are dedicated to supporting me in completing the research and training
aims proposed in this K25 grant. Training: I will complete activities aimed to address gaps in my training with
the guidance of my mentoring team. My Training Objectives are to 1) acquire knowledge about gerontology
and geriatrics, 2) deepen my understanding of missing data mechanisms and techniques, 3) learn about the
appropriate use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research purposes, and 4) develop leadership,
networking, communication and grant writing skills. To accomplish these objectives, I will attend conferences,
seminars, journal club, case conferences and writing workshops, observe a geriatric clinician, and complete
coursework. The K25 grant will allow me to extend previous training, which will provide me superior
knowledge, experience and skills for my future as a biostatistical researcher in aging. Research: Early
identification of older adults at-risk of falling is critical so that preventative care plans may be implemented to
improve patient outcomes and reduce burden on the health care system. Most current prediction models
cannot handle repeated measurements over time and have not been used with EHR data. I propose to use my
BiMM forest method to develop a prediction model for fall risk over time. My Research Specific Aims are to 1)
impute (fill in) missing predictor data in Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study with a novel
machine learning method (BiMM forest); 2) develop a prediction model for identifying older adults at-risk for
falls; and 3) assess the feasibility of using EHR data to externally validate the prediction model. The prediction
model developed in this proposal will aid in identification of at-risk individuals for falls, allowing providers to
intervene early to reduce the burden of falls for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Results from this
grant will provide a basis for future R01 submissions to further validate the prediction model using EHR data
from multiple health care centers and evaluate the clinical utility of the model in practice."
10768720,"Project Summary
Although we spend a third of our lives sleeping, the function of this evolutionarily conserved behavior
remains elusive. Most studies investigating the function of sleep have focused on sleep in adults.
However, young animals spend an even greater proportion of their lives asleep, and their sleep is
deeper and has distinct electrophysiological features. Sleep in young animals is thought to aid brain
development by promoting plasticity. These plastic processes occur during critical periods in which
neural circuits are shaped by experience. Yet, the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms by
which sleep functions in critical period plasticity remains elusive. This proposal aims to address this
question by using a simple neural circuit in a genetically tractable model organism. In Aim 1, I will
define sleep substages using behavioral features and statistical modeling, as well as imaging
methods, and then determine if critical period plasticity requires a specific form of sleep. In Aim 2, I
will investigate the neurophysiological processes by which sleep promotes critical period plasticity
using patch clamp electrophysiology and investigate the genes that are important for this process
using single cell RNA sequencing. In Aim 3, I will perform a large-scale RNAi screen using a
behavioral assay to find novel genes that are involved in sleep-dependent critical period plasticity. In
addition, I will investigate whether sleep-related neural activity is generated by astrocytes to aid
critical period plasticity. Overall, these aims will delineate the function of specific sleep states in young
animals and identify cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent critical period

autism and attention deficit disorders, this work may have implications for the treatment of
neurodevelopmental conditions. To achieve these aims, I have brought together a mentoring team
which includes experts in computational modeling, transcriptional profiling, and developmental neural
plasticity. In addition, the proposed career development and research plan will capitalize on the
exceptional environment, facilities, and resources that Johns Hopkins University provides. My
overarching career goal is to obtain a tenure track faculty position and establish my own research

Continued tobacco use among cancer survivors is linked to an increased risk of lowered effectiveness of cancer
treatment, greater cancer-related mortality, developing a secondary primary cancer, worse quality of life, and
increased cancer treatment costs ($3.4 billion/year). Despite high quit rates at cancer diagnosis, more than half
of survivors who quit resume smoking shortly thereafter. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) hold great
promise in enhancing smoking abstinence among cancer survivors given its emphasis on purposefully paying
attention to immediate experience, thereby reducing reactivity to smoking triggers. The current proposal
addresses significant gaps in the extant smoking cessation literature for cancer survivors, which include: (1) A
limited understanding of the role of dynamic relations between cancer-specific (e.g., fatigue, pain, fear of cancer
recurrence) and general smoking risk factors (e.g., negative affect) contributing to smoking relapse given the
known chronic high stress level among cancer survivors, (2) Lack of real-time cessation interventions using
portable mobile devices such as smartphones (i.e., mobile health [mHealth]), (3) Little attention given to cancer-
specific cessation barriers for cancer survivors (e.g., shame, guilt) and (4) Barriers to treatment accessibility
among existing MBIs due to the time-intensiveness and in-person format. To address these gaps, the objective
of this proposal is to develop a mindfulness-based ecological momentary intervention (mindEMI) that delivers
MBI content in real-time and in the real world where quitting smoking takes place, and, when an elevated level

of cancer-specific smoking relapse risk is indicated through ecological momentary assessment (EMA).
There are three
specific aims. The K99 phase will take place at the Moffitt Cancer Center. The aims during the K99 phase include:
(1) To identify the most psychometrically sound EMA items for measuring negative affect, positive affect, and
state mindfulness and (2) to develop a mindEMI targeting cancer-specific smoking vulnerabilities through an
iterative multi-step process among cancer survivors who smoke. The R00 phase aims to conduct a 2-arm pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) among cancer survivors to test the feasibility and acceptability of the mindEMI
for smoking cessation. Feasibility of RCT procedures in preparation for a larger subsequent study will also be
examined. This proposal is highly innovative because the mindEMI will address a crucial gap in the literature by
targeting cancer-specific smoking vulnerabilities and deliver an MBI in real-time when relapse risk is high for
cancer survivors. This work will inform a future trial to fully test the efficacy of mindEMI and directly addresses
the NCI’s mission to conduct and support cancer research to promote longer and healthier lives."

The NYS International Training and Research Program (ITRP) of SUNY Downstate Health
Sciences University (DHSU) proposes to renew its existing HIV Research Training Program in
Kazakhstan (KZ) in collaboration with Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University (KNMU)
in Almaty. NYS-ITRP has a 25-year history of successfully providing advanced HIV research
training in the region and enhancing research capacity. While NYS-ITRP investments have
strengthened the ability of KZ to respond to the HIV epidemic, cases of HIV infection are rising,
substance use (SU) treatment is poorly developed, and the COVID-19 pandemic complicates
the delivery of both HIV and SU treatment. Long-term goals include addressing the behavioral
and structural interventions needed to respond to gaps in the HIV treatment cascade in KZ, with
an emphasis on SU disorders. Objectives include providing: 1) an 11-month certificate program
to 6 KNMU faculty to strengthen the research and academic capacity for KZ; 2) advanced
degree training (MS) in epidemiology for 2 KNMU School of Public Health (SPH) faculty; 3)
medium term training in epidemiology/biostatistics to 5 trainees from Kazakh Research Center
of Dermatology and Infectious Disease (KRCDID), National Research and Clinical Center of
Mental Health, and other KNMU faculty; and 4) research training capacity building for the KNMU
SPH. Key activities include short term training, including an annual 2-day scientific meeting at
KNMU, focusing on HIV treatment challenges and intersections with SU disorders, a 2-day
faculty development workshop, and expanding KNMU SPH curricula on topics covering
research design and addictive disorders. The program provides short-, medium-, and long-term
training modalities designed to provide the maximum, cost-effective training coverage for
individual trainees and strengthen research training at KNMU. Our efforts will focus primarily on
junior faculty from the KNMU SPH as well as representatives from KRCDID, and National
Research and Clinical Center of Mental Health, thus drawing together a deeper partnership
between national public health service and the academic research community. Long-term
trainees will be expected to develop a research proposal that uses in-country data related to
HIV and/or SU. All training is designed to bolster research capacity focused on the intersection
of SU disorder and the HIV treatment cascade and to enhance the role of KNMU as a national
leader in HIV-related research training. Measures to demonstrate increased capacity include
assessment of academic progress of faculty and student trainees; trainee surveys; KNMU SPH
core curricula review and development; and advanced in-country research support."
10808191,"Project Summary:
The developmental program encodes mechanisms that shape the chromatin landscape and drive large-scale
transitions in its organization, but the mechanisms whereby these changes are integrated into embryonic pat-
terning systems remain unclear. The genetic program that directs the initial patterning of the Drosophila embryo
has been exhaustively characterized, and many of the cis-regulatory elements whereby transcription factors pat-
tern the embryo have been identified. However, only recently has the field been able to measure changes in chro-
matin accessibility and occupancy with sufficient sensitivity to observe that these mechanisms are dynamic and
play critical yet underappreciated roles in development. Cis-regulatory elements are not static in their chromatin
state but instead change accessibility and modification status as a function of progression through the develop-
mental program. Interfering with the temporal progression of chromatin states disrupts embryonic patterning.
This project seeks to identify how patterning systems choreograph changes in epigenetic state to further under-
stand how this contributes to the regulatory logic of embryogenesis. The objective of this project is to evaluate
the impact of regulated chromatin states on the operation of a model gene regulatory network critical for Dro-
sophila segmentation, and to investigate in detail the mechanism whereby one component of the network pio-
neers open chromatin states. The central hypothesis is that regulatory networks employ transcription factors
whose primary role is to modulate accessibility states, and that this enables networks to generate more complex
patterns from a limited set of input factors. This project is justified through the rationale that the Drosophila
system provides unmatched resources for performing time-resolved genome-wide measurements of transcrip-
tion factor occupancy and chromatin accessibility in addition to allowing for the genetic manipulation of these
components for the comprehensive examination of dynamic chromatin states in the context of a developmentally
relevant regulatory network. The first aim will determine through the use of time-resolved ChIP- and ATAC-seq
on wild-type and mutant embryos the influence of chromatin accessibility on the binding site selection for all
transcription factors operating within a model gene regulatory network. The second aim will focus through the
use of a combination of biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches on the molecular mechanism for pioneer-
ing chromatin accessibility by one component of the network. The third aim will investigate through the use of
genetics and genomics how the embryo determines a period of competence for certain regulatory elements to be
granted accessibility. The significance of this proposal stems from the innovation to further the understanding
of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation within the broader framework of regulatory networks in develop-
ment in order to elucidate novel regulatory strategies for driving cell fate decisions. Because of the deep evolu-
tionary conservation of most developmental regulators from Drosophila to human, this project additionally will
identify factors that may function to modulate chromatin accessibility in both development and disease."

The goal of the University of California, Irvine MODEL-AD U54 Center is to develop novel mouse models of late-
onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), to deeply phenotype these and to make all data and mouse strains available
to enable researchers to select the optimal mouse model and timepoints for therapeutic and intervention testing,
as well as testing of hypotheses concerning mechanisms of LOAD. During the past five years, we have generated
and deeply phenotyped mice with one component of our base genetic platform in which the Aß region of the App
gene was converted from the rodent to the human sequence, and we have recently introduced the second
component, a humanized MAPT (TAU) locus produced via gene-replacement. We have also used CRISPR and
genome replacement to model and validate nine GWAS identified LOAD risk loci and have characterized mice
with each of these both on a wild-type and 5xFAD background to determine their effects on plaque generation
and damage exerted on the brain in response to pathology. In this continuation, we will use the results of these
analyses to identify the combinations of LOAD risk variants most likely to phenocopy LOAD and introduce them
on two complementary hAb-KI, hTAU, hAPOE4 platform lines, designed to mimic sub-types of AD that have
been recently defined. To ensure translationability, we have an expanded focus on biomarkers and alignment
with human phenotypes. To that end we have established a new Core – the Neuroimaging and neurovascular
core (NIVC), which will provide brain imaging modalities currently employed in human AD subjects to align
phenotypes in our mice with human disease progression. We have also expanded our fluid biomarker analysis
efforts to include CSF, as well as plasma lipidomics and metabolomics to be compared to human AD plasma
signatures. Similarly, our bioinformatics and data management efforts have been expanded to include single cell
and nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, as well as spatial transcriptomics to enable alignment of data from our
models with human AD signatures, but also to understand the mechanisms underlying disease progression in
our mice. We are utilizing a comprehensive approach to evaluate our mice across their lifespans, which includes
behavioral/cognitive assessment, electrophysiological analysis, super-resolution synaptic imaging,
neuroimaging, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, single cell level spatial transcriptomic analysis, unbiased
proteomics, and microbiome and metabolome investigations. The UCI MODEL-AD Center will leverage the
resources of our NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center combined with AMP-AD and other human
AD datasets to facilitate comparisons to the human condition to identify the best mouse models to evaluate
further. All data and models will be made available without restrictions, via The Jackson Labs, and data will be
explorable via the modeladexplorer.org website, and raw data freely available for download via the AD
Knowledge Portal."

Distinctive 2′-hydroxyl (OH) groups on every ribose make RNA an easy target of some
endonucleases, which damage RNA, creating products with 5′-OH and 2′,3′-cyclic
phosphate termini. Like DNA repair systems that surveil and repair lesions in the
genome to preserve the genetic code, the products of RNA damage are substrates for
coupled end modification and processing steps including ligation, stabilization, and
degradation. However, unlike the DNA damage response, we are only beginning to
understand how RNA cleavage, end modification, and processing are integrated, and
how together the “RNA damage response” promotes RNA processing and orchestrates
regulatory control. In this MIRA, we continue to explore the role of RNA damage and
repair, focusing on 4 specific questions: 1. What are the RNA targets of human kinase-
mediated decay?; 2. Do coupled 3′-end modification and 3′⟶5′ RNA decay control RNA
fate?; 3. What are the targets and physiological roles of bacterial Rtc RNA repair
enzymes? 4. How do 2′-phosphate modifications inhibit exonuclease degradation?"

The overall goal of this Program is to understand the role of MUC5B in establishing a vulnerable lung and the
transition of a vulnerable lung to a lung characterized by persistent injury of bronchoalveolar epithelia and
activation of lung fibroblasts. While our findings have identified a novel molecule (MUC5B) and target
(bronchoalveolar epithelia) for IPF, only ≈5% of individuals with this genetic variant develop usual interstitial
pneumonia (UIP) on HRCT scan, suggesting the need for another insult (a ‘second hit’) to initiate and intensify
the fibroproliferative process. Based on our preliminary findings, we postulate that while overexpression of
MUC5B places individuals at risk of developing IPF by causing persistent homeostatic ER stress of bronchiolar
epithelia, fibroblast recruitment and pro-fibrotic programming requires a second hit to the bronchiolar epithelia
resulting in detrimental ER stress and recruitment and activation of fibroblasts. Our Program includes 3 Scientific
Projects and 4 Cores, and our unifying scientific themes include: 1) IPF is initiated by enhanced expression of
MUC5B (first hit) that establish a vulnerable lung characterized by persistent homeostatic ER stress (without
substantial UPR or apoptosis); 2) secondary injury to the bronchoalveolar epithelia results in transition of a
vulnerable lung to a lung characterized by detrimental ER stress (involving substantial UPR and apoptosis) and
the development of microscopic bronchiolar-centric fibroproliferation; and 3) understanding etiologic and initial
biological responses in distal airway epithelia and AEC2 cells, and the interaction of bronchoalveolar epithelia
with lung fibroblasts will create opportunities for disease prevention and early intervention. The overarching
hypothesis of our Program is that the development of IPF requires two hits, MUC5B overexpression in
bronchiolar epithelia that induces a homeostatic, priming response and subsequent injury of the
bronchiolar epithelia that results in detrimental ER stress, aberrant epithelia, and fibroblast activation.
Project 1 will definitively address the drivers of MUC5B overexpression, Project 2 will identify the determinants
of epithelial injury and detrimental ER stress, and Project 3 will investigate the molecular interface between
MUC5B-induced epithelial injury and fibroblast activation. At the completion of this highly integrated Program,
we will have: 1) established the basic molecular mechanisms that regulate MUC5B-induced injury/repair process
in fibroproliferation; 2) defined mechanisms that will create a roadmap for primary and secondary intervention in
IPF; and 3) provided a rationale and targets for early intervention in a disease that remains a significant public

Evolution builds proteins with a remarkable combination of characteristics. They can fold spontaneously and
carry out difficult chemical reactions, but also are robust to perturbation and able to adapt as conditions of fitness
fluctuate. In recent years, sequence-based statistical models have provided specific models for how all these
properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of proteins. Here, we propose a data-driven, evolution-based
design (EBD) process that, with the developments outlined here, can address several basic problems in protein
mechanism and evolution. We will unify and optimize approaches for EBD and then apply it (1) to quantify the
functional sequence space of a protein family, (2) to parse the constraints on paralogs and orthologs of a protein
family, and (3) to understand how substrate specificity in an enzyme can adapt through a process of stepwise
variation and selection. The work is extensively supported by preliminary data, and is enabled by new
technologies for statistical inference, gene synthesis, and high-throughput functional assays, both in vitro and in
vivo. The outcomes will be a unified computational framework for sequence-based statistical inference, and an
serious test of the power of emerging evolution-based protein design approaches to understand and engineer
protein molecules."
10757944,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV persistence in reservoir tissues remains a major barrier to achieving a therapeutic cure despite effective
antiretroviral therapy (ART). Eradicating HIV-infected cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly
challenging since it is a site of immune privilege and is poorly accessible to ART drugs. While cognitive
impairment among people living with HIV has significantly reduced in the era of modern HIV treatment, about
30% of ART-suppressed HIV patients still display conditions of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND),
suggesting that even low levels of HIV persisting in the brain can cause neurological damage. Thus, functional
cure strategies that can safely eradicate replicating virus the CNS reservoir are urgently needed. Emerging
evidence suggests that myeloid cells, including brain macrophages (Mf), are sanctuaries of HIV persistence in
the CNS, and that HIV-infected macrophages are more resistant to CTLs than CD4 T cells. The goal of this
project is to develop a universal gamma delta (γδ) CAR-T platform with dual HIVenv/Mf-targeting for HIV-
infected myeloid cells in the CNS reservoir. Our central hypothesis is that adding Mf specific CAR to anti-HIV γδ
CAR-T cells will enable efficient targeting of HIV-infected cells in the CNS reservoir. Our data in rhesus
macaques show enhanced in vitro killing of HIV-infected monocytic cells by γδ CD4-CAR-T cells and greater
Granzyme B cytotoxicity, which has been shown to be critical for CTL killing of HIV-infected primary
macrophages. Based on the unique functional properties of γδ T cells, including (i) well-documented CTL activity
in immunotherapy of cancer, (ii) ability to migrate to sites of neuroinflammation, and (iii) innate anti-HIV/SIV CTL
functions; we hypothesize that the dual γδ CAR-T cells will induce more effective targeting of myeloid HIV
reservoirs. In Aim 1, we will develop approaches for generating retroviral and lentiviral vector-based γδ CD4-
CAR-T cells toward enhanced targeting of SHIV-infected primary Mf and microglial cells. In Aim 2, we will test
the in vivo potential of the optimized γδ CAR-T cell to migrate and engraft in the CNS during viremic infection
with the novel macrophage-tropic TF SHIV.D model of CNS pathogenesis. The proposed research is significant
because its successful completion will lead to the development of a universal γδ CAR-T cell model with enhanced
targeting of tissue macrophage reservoirs including the CNS in a clinically relevant model of SHIV.D infected
rhesus macaques."

(Winship), is executed by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), which aligns clinical
research with research programs and catchment area priorities, and oversees the scientific quality, merit, and
feasibility of clinical trials. The PRMC is responsible for review, prioritization, and monitoring to ensure an
innovative, impactful, and balanced clinical research portfolio that meets the needs of the Winship catchment
area. The PRMC oversees the approval and termination of clinical trials based upon evaluation of scientific
validity, feasibility, and accrual. The PRMC operates independently from the Winship Clinical Trials Office
(CTO) and the DSMC. PRMC reviews are complementary and non-duplicative of IRB reviews. An initial
scientific review is performed by the Winship Treatment Modality Working Groups (TMWG) that meet regularly
to review trials and select studies for inclusion in their portfolios. In 2021, the PRMC reviewed 571 clinical
trials; 40% were new protocols out of which 32% were expedited reviews and 40% institutional and externally-
peer reviewed trials. The PRMC conducts quarterly scientific and accrual progress reviews for active trials.
Enhancements to address new CCSG guidelines and further improve the efficacy of the PRMC since
Winship’s last competitive grant renewal include: (1) risk level determination for all treatment trials; (2)
prioritization of existing trials portfolio and establishment of review criterion of relevance to the catchment
area; (3) annual surveys of Winship members to obtain feedback on PRMC functions and scientific utility; (4)
PRMC membership update to balance representation of clinical specialties, race, ethnicity, and gender; and
(5) enhanced training for TMWG members."

10854964,"Abstract
Two individuals’ DNA is said to be identical by descent when the individuals inherited it from a shared
ancestor such as a great-grandparent. Identity by descent (IBD) occurs in relatively long segments of
several million base pairs when the shared ancestor lived within approximately the past 50 generations.
Since ancestors from 50 generations ago can have many descendants, it is possible to find segments of
IBD between many pairs of individuals without known relationships.
The goal of this proposal is to develop three new applications of IBD segments.
The first application is estimating recombination rates. Recombination rates vary across the genome, and
the rates must be estimated in order to perform many other genetic analyses. We will develop methods
that use IBD segments to estimate recombination rates from population sample data. We will also develop
methods to rigorously compare IBD-based recombination maps across populations. We will estimate
recombination rates in different human populations, and we will investigate regions of the genome where
there are differences between populations.
The second application is estimating sex-specific demographic history. Males and females can have
different effective population sizes due to differing variability in reproductive success, and males and
females often have different rates of migration. We will develop method to estimate sex-specific effective
population sizes and mutation rates by comparing rates of IBD segments on the X chromosome (which is
weighted towards female history) and the autosomes (which are equally weighted between male and
female histories). This work will improve our understanding of the historical dynamics that have shaped
populations.
The third application is analyzing recent positive selection. Selected regions can be found by looking for
elevated levels of IBD. We will develop statistical methodology to estimate the strength of selection, the
mode of selection, and the frequency of the selected variants. We know that selection differs across
geographic regions due to different pathogens and other environmental exposures, and we will analyze
diverse populations to catalog selected regions and how they differ between populations."
10840461,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are an enormously costly worldwide health concern. They
cause nearly 80,000 lower leg amputations annually in the U.S. alone and are associated with significantly
increased likelihood of death. Strategies to improve their healing have been a subject of intense study for
decades, yet myriad cellular and pathophysiological abnormalities continue to severely limit efficacy of
standard therapies. Promising therapeutic alternatives include the application of cellular scaffolds, topical
growth factors (especially platelet-derived growth factor), or combination wound dressings. However, the
incidence of complete closure remains strikingly low and growth factor delivery strategies largely fail owing to
their instability in the inflammatory, MMP-rich environment of the chronic wound. New strategies that can
normalize this proteolytic and inflammatory environment, by stimulating local production of therapeutic proteins
by fibroblasts and macrophages, would thus offer a provocative approach to improve clinical outcomes.
 We have recently demonstrated that protease activity in the wound bed can be harnessed to
stimulate localized growth factor gene delivery and provide tailorable expression of growth factors
over multiweek timeframes. We introduce collagen mimetic peptide (CMP) and therapeutic gene-modified
collagens (COATs) as a platform for (i) robust retention of growth factor-encoding polyplexes in collagen-
containing wound dressings and (ii) localized, cell-initiated gene delivery during collagen remodeling. Because
COATs integrate DNA polyplexes directly into collagen fibrils, our approaches have been shown to significantly
improve in vivo wound repair at concentrations of growth factors orders of magnitude lower than those in
currently employed topical therapies. These outcomes, coupled with recent advances in the translation of other
gene therapies, suggests the high potential for clinical impact of the COATs platform.
 In the proposed R01 program, we will apply COATs in experimental DFUs and cell-based assays to
understand three important aspects of orchestrating wound repair, in the following three Aims. In Aim 1, we will
probe variations in CMP modifications that optimize the extended delivery of genes (initially for platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF)) in a murine diabetic wound environment. In Aim 2, we will complement these studies
with cell-based investigations that elucidate the role of MMPs (soluble and membrane-bound) in regulating
PDGF gene delivery by COATs and PDGF protein lifetime. In Aim 3, we will test how COATs-mediated,
sequential delivery of genes for immunomodulatory cytokines (IL4 and IL10) modulates MMP activity in DFUs.
These approaches will provide both mechanistic insights for resolving the chronicity of DFUs, and also a new
platform that could be integrated into existing wound-care strategies to dramatically improve clinical outcomes."

Project Summary
The Administrative Core will provide overall management, coordination and oversight to ensure the
achievement of the Phase III CoBRE program's two major objectives: 1) facilitate the transition of research
cores to sustainable state-of-the-art facilities; 2) sustain the research environment by supporting pilot research
projects and career guidance and enhancement. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims:
1) provide administrative support and coordinate Center activities, 2) oversee the functioning and development
of research cores to ensure their sustainability, 3) oversee the Pilot Project Grant Program, 4) facilitate
research and career development opportunities for Center investigators, 5) foster scientific interactions and
collaborations among Center investigators and other IDeA programs, 6) recruit additional Center investigators
and increase Center visibility, 7) ensure compliance with local and federal research regulations on human
subjects, vertebrate animals and biosafety, and 8) coordinate CoBRE program evaluation."
10909812,"The management of dopamine resistant postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) features, such as freezing
of gait (FoG), represents perhaps the most important unmet clinical need in Parkinson's disease (PD).
Research into the role of the vestibular system in the etiology of FoG has largely been neglected. Age-
associated vestibular impairment (presbyvestibulopathy, PVP) is present in about half of older community-
dwelling older persons and is a significant contributor to imbalance and falls. PVP is also common in PD, an
age-related neurodegenerative disorder. We have novel preliminary data showing that PVP may be an
important factor contributing to FoG. Confirmation of a mechanistic link between vestibular dysfunction and
FoG has high clinical translational impact and may augur novel vestibular rehabilitation interventions, such as
in-home portable thermoneuromodulation (TNM) to treat PD Veterans with otherwise treatment-refractory FoG.
Plan: Our main aim will be a cross-sectional study in 64 Veterans with PD to investigate the relationship
between PVP and FoG. Our exploratory aim will be a mechanistic feasibility trial of portable TNM in PD
Veterans with FoG and PVP.
Methods: We will perform detailed clinical, including dedicated motor and vestibular testing. PE2I dopamine
transporter (DAT) PET will be used to assess the integrity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal innervation.
Hypothesis 1: The prevalence of FoG is higher in Veterans with PD who also have evidence of PVP
compared to those without PVP independent of nigrostriatal dopaminergic losses.
Exploratory hypothesis: Active TNM stimulation will result in improved FoG severity ratings compared to
sham stimulation in PD Veterans with FoG and PVP."
10862796,"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) account for nearly 3% of all cancers in the U.S. and most
commonly affect aging individuals. While chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment
approach for HNC, the method is known to cause substantial side-effects. In particular,
anatomical changes occurring during the treatment may result in under-coverage of the clinical
target volume or over-dosage of organs at risk.
The project will develop novel optimization models for Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) – a
customized treatment planning approach for individual patients designed by evaluating the
systematic and random variations in tumor response. The models will use imaging data of tumor
volume and normal tissue complication probabilities to determine the optimal number and timing
of treatment replans. The models will provide personalized optimization through sequential
decision-making based on response to treatment, as well as optimization and evaluation of
simple threshold replanning policies often used by doctors. Optimal behavior in the face of
conflicting payer/provider perspectives for emerging technologies will also be analyzed using
mechanism design techniques. ART requires information about patient-state as well as transition
probabilities describing the tumor's evolution over time. Since the process inherently calls for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, the proposed optimization models use a Markov
Decision Process (MDP). The resulting optimal policies may be difficult to implement in practice,
especially in centers lacking state-of-the-art equipment. Therefore, the proposed work will further
evaluate simple threshold replanning policies using a bilevel programming framework. In
particular, the bilevel program will find threshold values for various patient classes by minimizing
the deviation from the MDP-prescribed policy.
The proposed framework offers multiple avenues for methodological contributions. The novel
MDP design framework is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to model many
interesting questions. We will explore ways of discretizing the continuous state spaces and
estimating transition probabilities based on patient imaging data. We will explore algorithms for
solving bilevel programs, especially utilizing the structure and properties of the lower-level MDP
models. Finally, we will study applications of the principal-agent framework from economics in
modeling payer/provider interactions for emerging clinical therapies.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
This study uses novel models to develop and validate an integrated approach to reduce cancer
radiotherapy side effects while maintaining or improving cancer control. It will maximize efficiency for
patients and providers. Its findings will inform decisions about individual radiation planning, optimize risk-
stratified treatment, and healthcare policy implementation of effective new technology interventions."

consists of 35 institutional leaders who represent training initiatives across the campus and community. The ETC
meets monthly and provides oversight for developing new educational courses, coordinating cancer-related
education across COH, fostering the career development of our trainees and faculty, evaluating the efficacy of
our educational programs, and ensuring that training in core competencies is provided. Dr. MortimerCI, together
with the ETC has established an Office of Mentorship and recruited Carlotta GlackinMCBC, PhD, to oversee
mentorship alignment across COHCCC. The institutional and CCSG leadership are dedicated to investing in
training and developing a diverse workforce; establishing an exceptional environment to facilitate and accelerate
transformative discoveries; developing and applying resources for faculty, staff, and students to ensure academic
success; and centralizing on-going training initiatives for researchers, clinicians, and staff. In the current funding
climate, newer faculty need additional training to become more independent researchers, and the COHCCC is
committed to supporting training opportunities through special seminars and workshops, as well as travel funds
for trainees to attend and present at national meetings. Over the past funding cycle, CRTEC has coordinated
programs that serve learners from all stages of training and diverse backgrounds. High school and
undergraduate students received intensive research experiences through the Eugene & Ruth Roberts Summer
Academy (established in 1960) and now supported by the TEAMS Stem Cell Biology program, and also from a
YES2SUCCESS (R25CA233431) program focusing on multidisciplinary training of students from under-
represented groups (URG). For undergraduate/graduate learners, we offer the CIRM Bridges and Stem Cell

10843118,"Abstract Plan to Enhance Diversity
The City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC)’s Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) is led by
Rick Kittles, PhD, COHCCC Associate Director for Health Equity and Angela L. Talton, PED Operations Lead.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion (DE+I) mission is to “infuse DE+I into our DNA”—to make sure DE+I is part
of our day-to-day interactions throughout COH while tailoring programming and initiatives to the needs of
individual areas such as the COHCCC. Our strategy seeks to highlight connections between DE+I and
innovation, precision medicine, compassionate patient care, and acknowledgment of diversity. The connection
being the need to respect and reflect differences as we seek to cure cancer for the entire population, not just a
subset of it. COHCCC is committed to being proactive in fostering an equitable, inclusive, and safe environment
that embraces diversity and diverse perspectives. Basic, translational, clinical, and population science research
flourish when faculty, staff, and students are empowered to think big. COHCCC promotes values of scholarship,
leadership, transparency, and accountability in the pursuit of excellence in discovery, learning, and service.
Within a highly dynamic research environment, COHCCC advances these guiding principles in the recruitment,
training, and development of future scientific leaders.
COHCCC has demonstrated significantly increased institutional commitment to DE+I over the last two years,
reflected by the hiring of Ms. Talton and the chartering of the DE+I Governance Council.
Highlighted DE+I accomplishments include:
The successful roll out of mandatory DE+I scenario-based, interactive training in Unconscious Bias and
Situational Inclusivity for all COH employees has laid the groundwork for an inclusive culture predicated upon
changing actions and behaviors. Development of a DE+I strategic plan, including triennial Diversity Climate
Surveys disseminated to all graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty, has allowed COHCCC to better
understand our present and potential diversity and inclusion performance, so we can plan for the future. We
sponsored—and executive leadership endorsed—a strategic initiative to increase the diversity of faculty and
strengthen COHCCC leadership in the science of health disparities and DE+I. Through the resulting
Interdisciplinary Cluster Hire Program, COHCCC will hire faculty with a demonstrated record of research,
teaching, and/or service to focus on African American and Latino health issues and populations.
Our Specific Aims for the next funding period are: 1) Build a sustainable program to enhance COHCCC’s
commitment to DE+I; 2) Through leadership commitment and strategic accountability, proactively foster an
equitable, inclusive, and safe environment that embraces diversity and diverse perspectives; and 3) Infuse DE+I
into the DNA of the COHCCC through a holistic approach."
10810722,"ABSTRACT
Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer. Genome destabilizing defects in DNA repair enable tumorigenesis
and cancer progression pushing cancer cells into dependence on a specific subset of DNA repair and genome
maintenance factors. Two such targets of the proposed program are DNA repair proteins RAD51 and RAD52.
The flexibility and adaptability of DNA repair networks allows cancer cells to employ them to enable rapid
evolution, progressive accumulation of genetic variation, genomic instability, the acquisition of invasiveness,
drug and radiation resistance and disease progression. Cells deficient in homologous recombination (due, for
example to defects in tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2) require RAD52 for survival, while overexpression
of RAD51 in cancers promotes radiation and chemotherapy resistance. Both proteins rely on their ssDNA binding
to carry out their cellular functions. Inhibition of DNA repair by interfering with RAD52 or RAD51 binding, or
entrapment of the toxic DNA repair intermediates with the help of small molecules has significant therapeutic
potential. Identifying disruptors of ssDNA binding specific to each protein represents a tough medicinal chemistry
challenge, but is a prerequisite for tailored low toxicity therapies. Natural products have an unrivaled place in
early stage drug discovery and occupy an unparalleled chemical space for protein binding, which will be
employed to elucidate the structural and chemical aspects of specific inhibition of our target proteins.
Our published and preliminary studies established robust biophysical (FRET-based) assays to monitor the
ssDNA binding by RAD51, RAD52 and Replication Protein A (RPA), a major human ssDNA binding protein
whose inhibition is likely to be toxic. Proof-of-principle screens confirmed that we can readily identify small
molecules and natural products specifically inhibiting each of the three proteins. We have also developed a
computational workflow that accurately predicts interactions between small molecules and the DNA binding
groove of RAD52. Here, we propose to carry out a screening campaign to identify a range of natural product
scaffolds that can be developed into potent, specific and non-toxic disruptors of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction
and to build a framework for discovery of RAD51 natural products inhibitors. We will screen a unique library of
natural products, an NCI Program for Natural Product Discovery (NPNPD) Prefractionated Library consisting of
320,000 fractions, which were produced by separating the unique crude extracts derived from plant, marine, and
microbial organisms. Our high throughput screening and compound validation (Aim1) followed by in silico
analysis (Aim2) will yield sets of natural products scaffolds that will inform us on the regions and structural
features within the target site of RAD52, that can be targeted to achieve specificity and high affinity, and on the
chemical signature of the potential specific hits. Structure-activity relationships and rules for specificity learned
from these campaigns can be then utilized in scaffold hopping approaches to new synthetic RAD52 inhibitors."

rates that are more than double those observed in the general U.S. population (incidence: 89.0 vs. 38.6/100,000;
mortality: 39.6/100,000 vs. 13.8/100,000). These high rates cannot be explained by access to screening, as
dedicated efforts to increase CRC screening have resulted in screening rates in Alaska Native people that are
comparable to the US average. These disparities have persisted for over 40 years and are of noted concern to
community members and Tribal health leaders alike, making this a priority research area for Alaska Native
people. A key knowledge gap is the lack of sizable and comprehensive studies characterizing the molecular
features of colorectal tumors in Alaska Native patients. Accordingly, we propose an integrative approach to better
understand CRC tumorigenesis and molecular subtypes in this high-risk population, and to evaluate whether
various tumor and tumor microenvironment features contribute to disease progression. Specifically, we aim to
deeply characterize the mutational, transcriptional, and cellular landscapes of CRC tumors and their immune
microenvironments in 500 Alaska Native patients and link these characteristics to CRC-specific mortality. We
will build on our existing collaboration between the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) and the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. We will capitalize on ANTHC’s unique biorepository (linkable to comprehensive
medical records) that contains tumor tissue samples of the majority of Alaska Native CRC patients diagnosed in
Alaska. Pilot data generated using biospecimens from this resource and utilizing the same platforms as proposed
here demonstrate high-quality data and ensure that IRB and tribal approvals are in place to enable rapid
execution of the proposed work. To identify clinically meaningful population differences, we will compare
molecular profiles with those from non-Hispanic White CRC patients using available data. In Aim 1, we will
perform whole-exome sequencing of CRC tumors and paired normal samples to identify driver genes and
clinically actionable mutations particularly relevant to the Alaska Native population. To gain etiological insight,
we will analyze mutational signatures that may be linked to environmental exposures and identify germline
mutations in high-penetrance CRC risk genes to investigate their role in the increased CRC risk in Alaska Native
people. In Aim 2, we will apply two complementary cutting-edge spatial profiling technologies to fully characterize
the tumoral immune response and discover mechanisms of immune evasion. We will perform spatial whole
transcriptome profiling of CRC tumors using Nanostring’s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling technology. We will use
Akoya Biosciences’ PhenoCycler platform for spatially resolved single immune cell phenotyping. We expect that
insights gained through this work can inform the development of high-value, novel therapeutic strategies. In Aim
3, we will leverage these molecular data to develop novel predictors of CRC-specific mortality that could help
guide clinical decision making, improve outcomes, and reduce long-standing disparities."

The Training Program in Substance Use Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS)
will offer late-stage predoctoral (PhD) students and early-stage postdoctoral fellows an integrated program of
training in substance use disorders (SUDs) research that leverages the exceptional expertise in cellular,
molecular and behavioral neuroscience, translational neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, genomic science
and pharmacological sciences at ISMMS. The overarching goal of the program is to provide rigorous, broad-
based, individualized, and multidisciplinary training with enhanced opportunities for mentoring, collaboration,
and career development designed to prepare the next generation of independent investigators in SUDs
research. At the heart of this new Training Program will be a superb training faculty representing remarkable
diversity in basic and clinically relevant topics; from synaptic plasticity and chromatin remodeling; cognitive,
social, and emotional disorders; disorders of mood, motivation, and anxiety; addiction; human
neuropsychology; and cognitive neuroscience – all relevant to SUDs. The Training Program comprises inter-
related components: academic coursework, laboratory training, non-curricular training activities (seminars,
retreats, etc.), testing/evaluation, teaching opportunities, mentoring, and career development activities. The
diverse research environment at ISMMS will provide for laboratory opportunities in core areas of strength,
including in translational neuroscience, computational neuroscience, neuropsychiatric genomics,
neuroimaging, epigenetics, and synaptic and behavioral plasticity, and the study of diverse model systems.
The Training Program includes more than a dozen initiatives that have been newly created or adapted from
existing programs to support training in SUDs, which emphasize multidisciplinary collaborations, and the
promotion of exceptional rigor and creativity. Pre- and post-doctoral trainees will participate in required and
optional training activities to ensure strong grounding in basic neuroscience and opportunities to learn from and
with peers and faculty from across ISMMS, including those in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the
medical school, interdisciplinary Centers and Institutes, and the Friedman Brain Institute. Creating a structured
culture of mentoring across the career continuum of participants is a hallmark feature of the Training Program.
Formal and informal advising and mentoring will be integrated into training across roles and levels, including
mentoring opportunities for training faculty and sponsors (preceptors). Integrating predoctoral and postdoctoral
training through formal mechanisms will provide greater continuity in the overall training experience, enhanced
opportunities for collaboration among trainees interested in pursuing careers in SUDs research, and will benefit
the neuroscience research effort at ISMMS. The Training Program in Substance Use Disorders will prepare the
most promising trainees for productive, independent careers in SUD research at all levels – from preclinical
genetics, cellular and molecular mechanisms of the disorders, to clinical research and interventions."
10843207,"The theme of the UCLA-CMCR Program is to discover and
develop novel and unique drugs, or to repurpose existing agents, that mitigate acute, delayed, and
long-term radiation syndromes. We have already identified over 30 mitigators of hematopoietic acute
radiation syndrome (H- ARS), some of which are in quite advanced drug development. Some are
effective in multiple models of acute, delayed and long-term radiation tissue damage, which makes
them of particular interest as every cell in the body is damaged after exposure to moderate doses of
radiation and polypharmacy to mitigate every syndrome would be almost impossible to achieve. We
believe that broad activity results from action through primitive, highly conserved, developmental
signaling pathways that are responsible for the formation of body structures, but that also guide
regeneration in damaged tissues and regulate chronic inflammation. The role of these pathways in
diverse radiation syndromes, acute and delayed, form a major theme in this application. Our Projects
will therefore extend our portfolio of mitigators with an emphasis on developmental signaling pathways
in multiple tissues. Two focus on Acute syndromes and two on late syndromes. We believe that
delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) are due to incomplete healing during H-ARS,
resulting in skewing of the immune system that generates persistent oxidative stress, chronic
inflammation, and dysregulated homeostasis in multiple tissues. This is consistent with our finding that
mitigation of H-ARS by drugs that trigger developmental pathway signaling can affect DEARE. Our
Service Cores are geared to drug and animal model optimization. They will improve the efficacy and
delivery of drugs through FDA-approved formulation and chemical synthesis that aims to improve
solubility, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, and uniqueness of matter. The animal models will
have pathophysiologically-defined, dose-response relationships for acute and delayed endpoints of
morbidity and mortality using gnotobiotic and germ-free mouse strains. Comparisons will be made to
the effects of FDA-approved H-ARS mitigators in these diverse radiation syndromes. The
Administrative Core serves to integrate projects, service cores, and pilot projects and provides a
conduit to the CMCRC, governmental bodies, industry, and academia. It provides cohesion for the
UCLA-CMCR and ensures that it meets the common goals established by NIAID, the FDA, and the
CMCRC. It also provides an educational infrastructure for members and its Executive Committee helps
investigators prioritize drugs for development and testing, and with regulatory and intellectual property
issues."

The human microbiome plays a vital role in health and disease. However, the ways in which bacteria affect the
human host at a molecular level remain poorly understood. In order to harness connections between the
microbiome and disease to improve human health, we need to know more about the molecules and chemical
mechanisms driving host-microbiota interactions. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand and
control the chemistry of human-associated bacteria in order to uncover how the microbiome affects human health
and disease.
We are prioritizing the study of human gut bacterial metabolism of host-produced small molecules (endobiotics)
and how the resultant compounds affect host physiology. Endobiotics such as steroids and vitamins act as crucial
signaling molecules and regulators of host biology, but their metabolism by gut bacteria has been relatively
unexplored. We aim to uncover the biosynthetic pathways and biological roles of host-produced, bacterially
modified metabolites. We are also expanding the scope of our studies of microbiome metabolites to study novel
transformations of host- and diet-derived metabolites by microbiome bacteria and how these metabolites affect
the host.
With the support of an NIH ESI MIRA grant, my group has established a track record of discovering gut microbial
metabolites of bile acids, elucidating how these compounds are biosynthesized, and determining the effects of
these compounds on the host. We have demonstrated that we can advance microbiome research from molecule
discovery to in vivo effects. These studies have allowed us to establish a roadmap for the proposed studies
investigating microbiome metabolites more broadly. Over the next five years, we will (1) discover new chemical
transformations by human-associated bacteria that lead to bioactive metabolites, (2) investigate the effects of
microbiome metabolites on host physiology, including host immune response, metabolism, and neurological
function and behavior, and (3) identify active enzymes responsible for keystone microbiome transformations
using comparative metabolomics and chemoproteomics. By taking a chemically guided approach to
understanding both the production and in vivo functions of microbiome metabolites, we will gain a more complete
understanding of these molecules and their biological activities than has ever been established. This work will
provide us with a deeper understanding of how gut bacterial metabolism of host- and diet-derived compounds
functions on a molecular level and how this activity affects host physiology. Our research program will also lay
the groundwork for the rational manipulation of the microbiome in a clinical context to treat disease and improve
health."

The cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major challenge for the treatment of patients with acute
ischemic stroke by intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and endovascular therapy. Currently, there is no effective
intervention available to treat/prevent cerebral I/R injury. Emerging evidence suggests that thrombotic and
inflammatory responses (thrombo-inflammation) and aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the brain
elicited by cerebral I/R contributes importantly to secondary brain injury and neurologic deterioration. In this
proposal we wish to develop a novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategy to simultaneously target these
pathological processes of cerebral I/R injury through distinct molecular mechanisms. Recently, decreased
expression of miR-30c has been implicated in many pathological conditions in both patients and animal models.
In preliminary studies, we show that miR-30c is highly expressed in blood platelets, cerebral microvessels, and
cortical/hippocampal neurons in normal mice but its levels decline with age. miR-30c levels in both blood and
brain are markedly decreased after ischemic stroke and elevating miR-30c by single IV injection of synthetic
miR-30c mimic significantly protects against cerebral I/R injury. We further show that the increased expressions
of the direct target genes of miR-30c (including PAI-1 in both blood and brain, elF2α and caspase-3 in the brain)
induced by cerebral I/R injury were significantly decreased by IV miR-30c mimic treatment. Based on these
exciting new findings from young adult mice, we propose the innovative hypothesis that miR-30c functions as a
critical regulator of thrombo-inflammation and ER stress in the ischemic brain elicited by cerebral I/R injury, and
thus targeting miR-30c represents a novel therapeutic approach for combating cerebral I/R injury. Following
updated stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) pre-clinical guidelines, we will test this
hypothesis in aged male and female mice. Specifically, we will determine the efficacy and safety of IV miR-30c
mimic as novel stroke therapeutics (Aim1). Using complementary approaches, i.e. the “gain-of-function” (miR-
30c mimic) and “loss-of-function” (anti-sense Morpholino oligos that are designed to specifically compete with
miR-30c for binding sites of 3’UTR of each individual target gene and thus acts as a “target protector”), we will
identify PAI-1 as a key molecular target of miR-30c in regulation of post-stroke thrombo-inflammation (Aim 2),
and identify elF2α and caspase 3 as key molecular targets of miR-30c in regulation of post-stroke neuronal ER
stress and neuronal cell death (Aim 3). The long-term goal of these studies is to evaluate if targeting miR-30c is
a viable option for stroke therapy in both male and female older populations at high risk for stroke."

The goal of this training grant is to equip junior investigators with the skills to make enduring contributions to
child digestive health, which encompasses processes that are critical for the survival, growth, and well-being
of people and populations. We achieve this goal by providing immersive research training at Washington
University in fields relevant to digestive health of children worldwide. The rationale for our training program is
based on two premises: (1) high quality early career training is critical for producing individuals who will make
meaningful and lasting impact on the field, and (2) too few individuals are adequately trained to solve problems
relevant to the childhood digestive system. Mentors across all disciplines share dedication to research
relevant to digestive health of children, have strong training records, are very well supported by federal and
foundation grants, and integrate our T32 trainees into existing projects to prepare them for productive scholarly
careers. Track I (Microbial–Host interactions in the Gastrointestinal Tract) trainees determine how gut
pathogens and microbial populations beneficially or harmfully affect childhood digestive health. Track II
(Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Developing Gastrointestinal Tract) trainees dissect molecular and
genetic aspects of congenital and acquired disorders of the childhood gastrointestinal system and host
response to inflammatory stimuli. Track III (Translational Biology of the Gastrointestinal Tract) trainees use
data from humans and populations to further knowledge of digestive disorders of childhood. This program will
fund four post-doctoral (MD, PhD, or MD-PhD) drawn from our traditional base of pediatric gastroenterology
fellows and post-doctoral trainees, strengthened in the past five years by extension to surgical residents. We
will also fund members of the expanding community of PhD and MSTP students interested in the problems we
strive to solve by also funding pre-doctoral candidates and Medical Scientist Training Program enrollees.
Applicants to the program will receive two years of highly mentored support, including an external mentor
system. We will also expand our portfolio of training opportunities to include large data base analysis,
nationwide cohort study training, and implementation science. We will also co-sponsor an annual retreat
focused on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusivity in our training, research, and clinical care. The program
will also remain integrated into the Washington University Digestive Diseases Research Core Center
(DDRCC). The trainees we fund also strengthen multilevel collaborations between gastroenterology and
surgical research in our institution. Our intent is to produce scientists with enduring interests in childhood
digestive diseases and their causes, treatments, and prevention, by our cohorts of trainees and mentors who
share complementary goals and skills."

Currently, more than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); a
number that is expected to more than double by 2050. The projected growth in population aging and dementia
requires an army of skilled researchers to accelerate research on ADRD and produce evidence that provides
better clinical care and services for people living with dementia and their families - goals of the National Plan to
Address Alzheimer's Disease. The proposed training program, ""TRAINing in Aging Health & Health Services
for Dementia Care (TRAIN-AD),” seeks to develop the next generation of researchers skilled at integrating
epidemiological and biostatistics methods into health services research with applications in dementia care.
Over the last decade, major advances in the knowledge base of gerontology, with an emphasis on ADRD,
have been occurring thanks to a proliferation of genetic, clinical, epidemiological and health services data that
can be leveraged to address novel research questions. Researchers of the future must know how to maximize
the use of these data sources. Thus, in the future there will be a premium placed on young investigators
cognizant of methodological advances ranging from new strategies for collecting, merging and managing data
sets; new and refined statistics and analytic strategies; and major new tools for integrating social, health, and
biological data.
The proposed renewal of our training program addresses the major goals of the NIA Strategic Plan for
research, by educating well-trained researchers with multi-disciplinary experience and a broad understanding
of the biological, social, health, service and policy aspects of aging and dementia care. Building upon a rich
research and training environment with over two decades of experience training investigators focused on
understanding how the older adults use and are affected by health services, this competing renewal application
will: 1) Recruit high quality doctoral students into aging research with a specific focus on ADRD; 2) Provide
training in substantive topics relevant to health services research in aging and ADRD; 3) Provide education in
epidemiological and statistical methods with applications to aging and ADRD research; 4) Provide research
experiences in ongoing health services research projects related to aging and ADRD; and 5) Prepare students
for research careers as independent scientists and leaders. Since our last renewal, the number and quality of
applicants has tripled and over half of the students this training grant has supported are from historically under-
represented groups. Given the increase in NIA-funded ADRD-related research among our faculty and
students, we are requesting 4 predoctoral slots who will be served by 36 trainers under this renewal."

Bioinformatics, computational biology, and omics are important areas that have the potential to uncover new
discoveries in the molecular/cellular mechanisms and gene networks that lead to congenital birth defects,
metabolic and genetic disorders, organ dysfunction, disorders of the immune system, and cancer in Pediatric
patients. The Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA proposes to fill the gap for
much needed specialized education and in-depth training of pediatric graduate medical education (GME) clinical
trainees in biomedical big data analysis, promote the establishment of multidisciplinary networks and
opportunities for collaboration in these specialized areas, and provide a bridge for trainees towards successful
participation as clinicians or clinician-scientists in multi-disciplinary team science towards obtaining future funding
for the discovery and amelioration of childhood disorders (i.e. T32, K23, K12, K08) and academic careers in
diverse research pathways. This program will focus on recruiting pediatric GME trainees from diverse
backgrounds, with an interest in clinician researcher or physician-scientist careers, and who have a desire to
build foundational skills in big data analysis. Specifically, the program will target Pediatric residents in their 2nd
or 3rd year of training and Pediatric subspecialty fellows at the start of their 2nd year of training. The 12-week
program, set to occur at the start of the academic year, will include weekly didactic lectures, taught by UCLA
faculty with expertise in bioinformatics, biostatistics, computational biology, and omics, covering key areas of big
data science and omics, accompanied by workshops linked to the specific topic presented in the didactic lectures,
and interactive journal club sessions. The interactive workshops, conducted by faculty and UCLA Quantitative
and Computational Biosciences Collaboratory postdoctoral PhD fellows, will reinforce concepts from the didactic
lectures through hands-on application of the knowledge via analysis of actual experimental datasets and use of
statistical techniques. The journal club sessions will be in a flipped classroom format and will reinforce concepts
covered in the didactic lectures and workshops to demonstrate the application of bioinformatics and
computational biology technology that lead to new discovery and advancement of Pediatric patient care. The
program will allow for remote access by pediatric trainees beyond the institution through virtual learning (hybrid
format) and availability of educational content online. Key areas of skills building will include next generation
whole genome sequencing, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analysis, single cell RNA sequencing,
DNA methylation analysis, microbiome analysis, and gene network analysis. This program will provide a unique
opportunity for pediatric GME trainees to receive more formal instruction and training in the very important areas
of big data analysis and directly interact with the faculty on campus, beyond the Department of Pediatrics, with
expertise in these areas who could potentially serve as research and career mentors, thus facilitating their
successful academic journey."

There is an urgent need to diversify the research workforce to meet current and future
research demands that support a healthy aging society. Lack of diversity is an important
problem in Medicine, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (MSTEM), where
inadequate institutional preparation and economic challenges can serve as barriers to entry.
Population health sits at the nexus of the MSTEM fields and thus a training program in
population health aging research is uniquely suited to serve as a bridge linking
underrepresented students to multiple MSTEM disciplines. Moreover, these fields are critical
for developing solutions to support health equity in aging. Our goal is to support scholars from
backgrounds underrepresented in MSTEM fields in the academic pathways to graduate
education and research in aging and population health. The Stanford Population Health Aging
Research - Advancing Health Equity and Diversity (PHAR-AHEaD) summer program is an 8-
week training and research experience for college students from underrepresented and
historically excluded groups in the health sciences. We bring together a diverse team of over
25 faculty members from across Stanford University to foster an inclusive academic
environment where college students can explore the core foundations of population health
sciences under the umbrella of a life course perspective on aging. Population health integrates
a spectrum of disciplines; a unique strength of our program is the breadth of training in aging,
epidemiology, statistics, health policy, and community engagement. We pair this instruction
with a faculty mentored research project to build skills and support student contributions to
team science. We enrich students with professional development opportunities to learn the
“hidden curriculum” of academia; these unwritten lessons and values are disproportionately
inaccessible to students from historically excluded backgrounds. PHAR-AHEaD was founded
on the principles that research experiences, faculty networks, and professional development
are crucial components in graduate school admissions and future success as a researcher.
Access to these opportunities is not equitably distributed, leading to underrepresentation and
exclusion in the field. We are committed to reducing known barriers and creating a more
equitable educational experience. This program will ignite interest and lower the barriers for
students from historically excluded and underrepresented groups to pursue further studies and
careers in aging and population health research."
10889935,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vulnerability to relapse remains a significant clinical hurdle in the treatment of addiction. Data from operant
rodent models of addiction and relapse indicate that cocaine-conditioned cue exposure evokes a pronounced
glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Cued glutamate release engages a cell type-specific
transient synaptic potentiation in NAcore medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which does not occur during cued
sucrose seeking. This transient synaptic potentiation consists of increased synaptic and structural plasticity in
MSNs. Importantly, the magnitude of this plasticity positively correlates with relapse behavior. We posit that both
the structural component (dendritic spine head expansion) and the synaptic component (increased insertion of
glutamate receptors) of this plasticity are engaged by nitric oxide (NO); a gaseous transmitter produced by
interneurons that express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Consistent with a role for these neurons in
cued relapse, we have recently demonstrated that elevated NO release in the NAcore also occurs in parallel with
glutamate release during cued cocaine seeking. The objectives of the proposed study are to reveal the inputs to
the NAcore required for NO release during relapse, to determine which receptors on NAcore nNOS neurons
regulate NO release and cued cocaine seeking, and to reveal how nNOS participates in the induction of the
transient structural and synaptic plasticity in MSNs that drives cued cocaine seeking. In Aim 1, we will use
chemogenetic inhibition of inputs to the NAcore while recording glutamate and NO release during cued cocaine
seeking. We predict that inputs to the NAcore carrying discreet aspects of cue and contextual salience will
differentially regulate NO release and cued relapse. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how glutamate and dopamine
receptors, specifically expressed on NAcore nNOS interneurons, act in concert to regulate NO production and if
they are required for cued cocaine seeking. To do this we will use transgenic mice that express Cre in nNOS
neurons, Cre-dependent shRNA viral vectors, as well as cocaine self-administration and cued cocaine seeking
trials. We predict that glutamate and dopamine receptor systems in nNOS neurons cooperatively regulate NO
release and cued cocaine seeking. In Aim 3, we will determine if loss of nNOS in the NAcore will prevent cue-
mediated synaptic and structural plasticity in MSNs. To do this we will use an shRNA vector to knockdown nNOS
and concomitant viral labeling of D1 or D2 receptor expressing MSNs in the NAcore. This will be done using
separate cohorts of D1-and D2-promoter driven Cre rats. In Aim 3, we will measure morphological and
electrophysiological readouts synaptic plasticity induced by cues. We expect that loss of nNOS will prevent both
forms of plasticity linked to relapse, predominantly in D1 MSNs. In conclusion, findings from these investigations
will reveal the mechanistic aspects of how nNOS neurons translate cocaine cue exposure to relapse behavior.
Accordingly, preventing this relapse signal transduction by preventing cued activation of nNOS neurons
represents a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce drug craving and prevent relapse."
10854928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanical interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) drive fundamental processes such as
morphogenesis, wound healing, and organization of bioengineered tissues. Our research focuses on how
these interactions regulate corneal keratocyte behavior through development of culture models that mimic the
3-D tissue environment, and use of multi-dimensional imaging approaches in vitro, in situ, and in vivo.
In the previous funding period, we used these tools to perform a comprehensive assessment of the
differentiation and patterning of corneal keratocytes following photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery in the
rabbit. These studies provided novel insights into the nature of the transition between native stromal and
fibrotic tissue, and how cells use the collagen lamellae as a template for tissue remodeling and regeneration.
Subsequent studies combining superficial phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) and UV cross-linking (CXL)
showed that CXL induces a disruption in normal cell patterning within the stroma, and appears to block the
development of fibrosis on top of the stroma. These studies highlight the profound impact that changes in
corneal structure and stiffness can have on overall corneal wound healing responses. However, the
large size and overall symmetry of standard CXL procedures extends the normal time course of
healing after PTK, and limits the scope of biomechanical insights that can be made.
Using our in vitro 3D culture models, we also performed mechanistic studies on how cell spreading and
collective migration are regulated in fibrin matrices, and identified key roles for fibronectin, 51 integrin, and
local cell-induced matrix reorganization in this process. We also demonstrated for the first time, that inhibition
of vimentin filament organization alters corneal fibroblast spreading, morphology and motility in 3-D matrices.
Vimentin has been associated with myofibroblast transformation of corneal keratocytes in vivo, and
recent studies in other systems suggest it can play a central role in regulating key aspects of cell
mechanical behavior, including mechanosensing, polarization, and directional migration.
Based on these and other published and pilot data, we now propose to: 1) Investigate the effects of tissue
stiffness and anisotropy on corneal wound healing following PTK, by applying UV cross-linking in specific
patterns determined from finite element modeling simulations, 2) Establish the time course of cell differentiation
and cell/matrix patterning during the development and resolution (remodeling) of fibrosis following full thickness
incisional injury, and determine the effects of modulating the wound boundary conditions and mechanical
environment on these processes, and 3) Apply our established 3-D culture models and engineered 2-D
substrates to investigate the role of vimentin in regulating corneal fibroblast differentiation, patterning and
mechanical behavior. Given the general importance of cell mechanics in numerous fields of cell biology,
these findings could have broad significance."
10844450,"Dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction plays a major role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Our
studies discovered that plasma hypercholesterolemia results in suppression of endothelial inwardly-
rectifying K+ (Kir) channels and that Kir channels play a major role in endothelial response to flow. Our long
term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for cholesterol-induced regulation of endothelial ion
channels and determine the impact of cholesterol-induced suppression of Kir on vascular function and
atherosclerosis development. During the previous funding period of this grant, we discovered a new mode
of cholesterol-Kir2 interactions via multiple dynamic contacts, provided direct evidence that Kir2.1 plays a
crucial role in flow-induced vasodilation and NO release, and showed that hypercholesterolemia-induced
impairment of flow-induced vasodilation can be attributed to Kir2.1 suppression. In the current proposal, we
extend these studies to address three new goals: In Aim 1, we address the fundamental question of how
cholesterol binding to the specific binding sites that we have already identified translates into the inhibition
of channel gating. Specifically, we address a novel hypothesis based on our computational studies
predicting that cholesterol binding uncouples specific residues within the channels, crucial for the gating
process. This hypothesis will be addressed using a combination of multi-scale Molecular Dynamics
simulations, a state-of-the-art computational approach, followed by site-directed mutagenesis, functional
analysis of the channel function by high throughput electrophysiology, and biochemical and neutron
scattering studies to evaluate direct cholesterol interactions with Kir2 channels. In Aim 2, we will extend our
studies to determine the role of cholesterol suppression of Kir2.1 in two major endothelial flow responses: 1)
activation of PECAM1/Src/VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt signaling axis and 2) cytoskeleton remodeling. This aim is
based on our RNA sequencing analysis that revealed a major role of Kir2.1 in flow-sensitive gene
expression including the expression of PECAM1/VEGFR2 mechanosensor complex. Specifically, we will
test the hypothesis that suppression of endothelial Kir channels by hypercholesterolemic conditions impairs
flow-induced activation of VEGFR2 and activation of a small GTPase, RhoA, and alters flow-induced
cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the role of endothelial Kir2.1 in lesion formation
of dyslipidemic mice. We have already established that the global deficiency of Kir2.1 exaggerates lesion
formation in dyslipidemic ApoE-/- mice. In the proposed study, we will determine if the effect is specific for
endothelial Kir2.1. Furthermore, we will also employ a new model of Kir2.1 rescue, a transgenic CRISPR
mouse that expresses a cholesterol-insensitive Kir2.1 mutant. We believe that taken together, these studies
will make a significant contribution to the understanding of cholesterol regulation of ion channels,
dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction, and the mechanisms of lesion formation."

 Medicine is currently undergoing a revolution, where viable gene therapies are being developed for
multiple disorders, including diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). One of the obstacles that limits the
use of gene therapy is the availability of safe and effective vectors for widespread delivery of genes. Due to its
stable transgene expression, broad tropism, and modest immunogenicity, recombinant adeno-associated virus
(rAAV) is the most widely used viral vector for human gene therapy. Almost 200 rAAV therapies have been
completed or are currently in clinical trials, including two FDA-approved therapies for genetic diseases of the
CNS. However, evidence is mounting that rAAV-based gene therapies are not without toxicity or significant risk,
with several rAAV-related deaths and numerous adverse outcomes reported during the past three years alone.
In a recent trial for Sanfilippo syndrome, 1 patient died and others demonstrated concerning MRI changes at
rAAV injection sites within the brain, halting the study. Other rAAV trials have reported serious adverse effects
ranging from thrombocytopenia to acute kidney failure to cardio-pulmonary insufficiency. While some of these
adverse effects are thought to be caused by immune reactions to the AAV capsid or transgene, increasing
evidence indicates that the rAAV genome, which contains two 145-base pair DNA segments named inverted
terminal repeats (ITRs), is a major source of rAAV toxicity.
 While conducting fundamental experiments on learning and memory, we discovered that rAAV was toxic
to dividing neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons, completely ablating adult neurogenesis in the
mouse hippocampus. Consistent with previous work, these experiments indicate that the AAV ITRs appear to
be sufficient and necessary for this toxicity. Embarking on a new research direction, we will utilize our
complimentary expertise in neuroscience, stem cell biology, and engineering to develop new methods for rAAV
production and create the first rAAVs with engineered ITRs that are safer for human gene therapy. These new
therapies will be particularly important in the treatment of neurodevelopmental and other diseases in children
who have active proliferation of stem/progenitor cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to rAAV toxicity. In the
current proposal we aim to:
Aim 1. Determine which components of the ITR DNA sequence are required for toxicity in NPCs in vivo.
Aim 2. Develop a cell-free synthetic rAAVs capable of packaging genomes with mutant ITRs.
Aim 3. Engineer an rAAV that will rescue loss of function in a murine model of Rett syndrome while
demonstrating less toxicity than conventional rAAVs."

CRISPR systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that use RNA-guided Cas nucleases to
recognize and destroy bacteriophage nucleic acids containing sequence complementarity to the guide
RNA. CRISPR systems harbored by different bacteria can be extremely diverse and use different
strategies to neutralize infecting phages. CRISPR systems are not well-represented in traditional model
bacteria. As such, their function has typically been studied by heterologous overexpression in E. coli.
Accordingly, we have limited knowledge of the complex interactions that arose from the co-evolution of
CRISPR-Cas systems with their natural hosts and the phages that infect them. Research in my
laboratory focuses on establishing natural models to investigate the interfaces between CRISPR-Cas
immunity, bacterial host physiology, and phage infection. While most of the six CRISPR types use Cas
DNases to recognize and cleave phage DNA, the type VI CRISPR system uses the nuclease Cas13 to
cut RNA instead. I have developed a natural bacterial host of the type VI CRISPR system, Listeria
seeligeri, and a collection of its phages as a tractable model for studying how this system protects
against infection. Once Cas13 engages target viral RNA, it becomes activated as a non-specific RNase,
resulting in widespread cleavage of both phage and bacterial RNA and the abortion of the phage
lifecycle. Thus, infected cells with type VI immunity do not lyse, and fail to produce viral progeny, but
stop growing and become dormant. The goals of this proposal are to (i) determine which transcripts
cleaved by Cas13 trigger entry into dormancy; (ii) understand how L. seeligeri cells survive the dormant
state, and resuscitate themselves once the phage has been eliminated, and (iii) discover and
characterize endogenous regulatory mechanisms controlling Cas13 activity in L. seeligeri and its
phages. The results generated by this research will provide fundamental insights into the molecular
biology of RNA-targeting CRISPR systems and aid in their development as biotechnology tools. Finally,
Cas13-induced cellular dormancy bears similarity to a phenomenon termed persistence, in which
subpopulations of pathogenic bacteria stop growing and become transiently tolerant of bactericidal
antibiotics during human infection. Therefore, the studies proposed here could reveal general
mechanisms by which persistent bacteria survive antibiotic exposure and re-enter the growth cycle,
which would represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common defect affecting approximately 1% of live births. Initially
developed and optimized for adults, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is increasingly used in
pediatric CHD patients to complement echocardiography and invasive angiography for anatomical and
functional evaluation of the heart and blood vessels. For children, the non-invasiveness, unrestricted field of
view, and absence of ionizing radiation make MRI an attractive imaging modality because many will need
sequential imaging and long-term follow-up evaluations. However, current CMR for very young children
requires general anesthesia and invasive intubation for acquisition of images that are of acceptable diagnostic
quality. In the past 5 years, we pioneered ferumoxytol-enhanced CMR techniques that provide unprecedented
image quality and diagnostic value; this technique has changed how CMR for pediatric CHD is clinically
performed at our center. Our diagnostic application of ferumoxytol obviates any concerns about gadolinium
accumulation in biologic tissues, In this renewal R01, we aim to develop next-generation CMR that can be
performed without invasive intubation, and potentially with reduced anesthesia/sedation exposure. We further
propose to build upon our improved CMR framework to develop advanced anatomical and hemodynamic
modeling techniques for complex CHD. Together, these tools provide a CMR image-based strategy to help
inform the patient's surgical plan and to ultimately predict surgical outcome. We will expand our multi-center
collaborations to pool data and enable larger scale studies. Completion of the project will result in clinical
deployment of new MRI pulse sequences, image acquisition and reconstruction strategies, and experimental
and computational modeling methods."
10832536,"Engineering mammalian gene activity sensors-actuator devices
Cellular devices that generate user-defined outputs in response to environmental cues hold unprecedented
opportunities for modern medicine through the development of living designer systems that detect and correct human
pathologies. These sensor-actuator devices are currently based on cell surface sensing capabilities, mostly achieved
by rewiring native ligand-receptor interactions or evolving non-native receptors linked to signal transduction systems.
The performance of receptor-based sensors depends ultimately on the signal transduction mechanism embedded in
the receptor system, however, and may not accurately recapitulate the physiologic response to the biomarker input.
Cellular physiological states are determined by complex mechanisms that integrate signals associated with different
quantitative features of extracellular and intracellular cues and provide blueprints to regulate the levels, states, and
dynamics of gene expression. Regulation of gene expression thus ultimately determines cell functionality during
physiological and pathological processes and is constantly and dynamically modulated to respond to environmental
as well as intracellular stimuli. We thus envisioned a novel class of cellular devices that actuate user-defined
biomolecular programs in response to the detection of the device’s physiological state achieved through real-time
monitoring of the activity of chromosomal genes. These gene activity sensor-actuator devices are based on innovative
tools recently developed by our groups for designing orthogonal systems that (i) link output expression to
chromosomal genes, thereby recapitulating complex mammalian regulatory processes with high fidelity, and (ii)
amplify the signal output with high resolution of the input dynamics, thereby recapitulating dynamic behaviors with
superior sensitivity.
To generate robust sensor-actuator devices that translate detection of gene expression signatures into user-defined
outputs, we will explore the design rules of sense-and-respond mechanisms for linking detection of gene activity to
output production (Aim 1), translate gene activity into precisely modulated delays in output production (Aim 2), self-
adjust output production in response to output-induced modulation of gene activity (Aim 3).
This approach is expected to create a paradigm shift in the way we design cellular devices that sense and respond to
the environment, as it will provide a strategy to engineer cells to sense virtually any cellular process associated with a
transcriptional response, eliminating the need to rewire ligand-receptor interactions or evolve synthetic receptor-based
devices. Results from this study will generate design rules of cellular devices that sense gene activity with high
dynamic resolution, enabling the development of cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics for a diverse range of
applications."

The mission of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) postdoctoral T32 Program is to contribute
to the nation’s biomedical workforce by training a diverse pool of scientists in clinical and translational science
(CTS) and leadership. We will meet this mission by developing, implementing, and continually improving a
training program for postdoctoral trainees (Scholars) that integrates a mentored research experience with an
individualized curriculum combined with professional development activities highlighting our institutional
strengths in community engagement, data science, team science and effective communication skills. The UMN
CTSI T32 Program is built upon our current successful Translational Research and Career Development
(TRACT) TL1 Program, which guided the development of early-stage CTS researchers over the past 4 years.
Through personalized mentorship, coursework, seminars, and other tools, the TRACT program has guided 6
postdoctoral Scholars along a rigorous path of professional development in CTS. Moving forward, the new
UMN CTSI T32 Program’s mission is to educate and train a diverse group of Scholars from across the UMN
system in the fundamentals of CTS through a 2-year comprehensive yet individualized program. We will recruit
and train 3 diverse (in discipline and underrepresented populations) cohorts of 4 postdoctoral Scholars from
across UMN. UMN CTSI T32 will provide a research experience with mentors trained in evidence-based
mentoring, focusing on collaboration and communication with community members throughout the research
process, inclusive of a Community Mentor and team science across the UMN ecosystem. The UMN CTSI T32
will also include near-peer learning experiences with other CTSI program Scholars as well as provide
education and opportunities for a variety of career paths. The UMN CTSI T32 will use a comprehensive and
adaptive evaluation plan for rigorous programmatic assessment and continuous quality improvement to
maximize the training experience. The principal Scholar outcome is to have a deep knowledge in the science
of translation beyond translational research. Another key Scholar outcome is an understanding of the
importance of, and key strategies for, building truly collaborative interdisciplinary teams composed of people
from diverse backgrounds and experiences whose collective roles synergistically optimize the advancement of
diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications that improve health. Other
outcome measures include the ability to communicate with other scientists and nonscientific audiences and
collaborators through our intensive formalized training in communicating science, and the ability to effectively
engage with communities through intensive community engagement training including a Community Mentor
Program. Programmatic outcomes include the development of training modules and workshops on the most
effective community engagement and communications strategies exportable to the national CTSA consortium."
10828761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the mixed predoctoral and postdoctoral T32HD071866 training program is to develop
burgeoning scientists into future leaders in translational rehabilitation research – scientists who are equipped to
test and disseminate novel rehabilitative strategies that will alleviate impairment and compromised life quality
in the face of chronic disease management. To meet this goal, we will build on achievements during the first
two funding cycles, as the program grew in number of trainees and established a reputation that attracts high
caliber applicants nationwide. The now proven program leverages an exceptionally rich institutional
environment that offers myriad resources, and a collaborative team of mentors who are deeply committed to
training and career development. Trainees benefit from two years of interdisciplinary training that carefully
meld three core levels of scientific inquiry: : (i) cellular, molecular, and computational pathobiology; (ii)
rehabilitation science/physiology; and (iii) epidemiology, clinical trials, and outcomes research. Based upon the
strength of expertise in our mentors, translational rehabilitation research training in the renewal period three
areas of concentrated strength: 1) Musculoskeletal Disorders, (2) Neurologic Diseases, and 3)
Cardiopulmonary Diseases. Predoctoral trainees are selected from a highly competitive and diverse national
pool admitted to a UAB graduate program (e.g., Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Rehabilitation Science).
Nationally recruited postdoctoral trainees leverage institutionally funded training/career development programs
tailored to meet diverse postdoctoral training goals. Each trainee’s primary mentor and Translational Mentoring
Team are drawn from expert program faculty across multiple UAB Colleges and Schools. Together the trainee,
mentor, and Translational Mentoring Team craft an individual development plan, approved and monitored
semi-annually by the Executive Committee. The plan includes coursework, laboratory and clinical research,
professional development programs, workshops, presentations locally and at national meetings, and training in
the responsible conduct of research. Learning to conduct and publish high-impact research is a primary focus.
The program will continue mentoring 3 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees each year, and will leverage
expansive resources to continue to maximize recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities and
individuals with disabilities. As a top 25 NIH-funded academic medical center with over 80 state-of-the-art
scientific core facilities and a connected network of University-wide, interdisciplinary research centers; the
University of Alabama at Birmingham is remarkably well-positioned to cultivate truly translational scientists
equipped to drive the field of rehabilitation medicine with cutting edge research."
10775775,"Publications by the National Research Council and National Academy of Sciences have highlighted a
continuing shortage of veterinarian-scientists nationwide and the pressing need to train more. In
addition, the 2014 NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Report stressed the need for more veterinarian-
scientists. Expansion of the pool of veterinarian-scientists is also a key component of the NIH Office of
Research Infrastructure Programs Strategic Plan for 2021 to 2025, where it is argued that veterinarian-
scientists are critical for public health, infectious disease research, development of animal models for
human disease, and biomedical research overall. Recruitment of veterinary students into biomedical
research careers could have a profound impact on both human and animal health. Exposure of veterinary
students early in their training to biomedical research has been shown to increase the numbers of
veterinarians who pursue biomedical research careers. For the past 33 years the University of
Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, has administered a short-term summer research program
for first and second year veterinary students to participate in research training, plus seminars on
career opportunities and career development, as well as opportunities for networking with veterinarian-
scientist mentors. This program has enabled 496 different veterinary students to perform biomedical
research with 187 different faculty mentors. In this program, veterinary students, with the help of an
executive committee, identify faculty sponsors. A group of 32 well-funded and experienced faculty
serve as the core training mentors, though students can potentially chose any qualified mentor at Penn.
With guidance from mentors, students apply to the program by writing a research proposal that is well
defined and addresses an interesting problem in biomedical research. Applications are reviewed with
respect to the credentials of the student, merit of the research proposal, and training environment
of the sponsor's laboratory. Students perform research in the mentor's laboratory during the months of
June, July, and August and participate in weekly seminars that emphasize career opportunities and
career development. Students receive training in grant writing, data presentation in written, poster
and oral formats, and information on career opportunities in academia, industry, and government.
Students also participate in trips to NIH, the Philadelphia Science Center, and the National Veterinary
Scholars Symposium (NVSS). In total, students present their research in an oral seminar, in poster
format, and in the form of a written scientific manuscript. Thus, students receive training in all
aspects of biomedical research. Outcomes data indicate that Program graduates are much more
likely to pursue further education and to enter research careers in academia, industry, or government,
and are less likely to pursue private practice careers."

10806964,"ABSTRACT
 Recent pandemic spread of antimicrobial resistance is highly alarming. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are
broadly used by clinicians for treatment of urinary tract infections, but FQ resistance levels in Escherichia coli
(the main uropathogen) are reaching 15-35%. FQ targets DNA gyrase (GyrAB) and topoisomerase IV
(ParCE), complexes that ensure maintenance of nucleoid super-coiling and structure in states appropriate for
replication and partitioning. The FQ resistance acquisition primarily emerges by structural alteration of the
target proteins with multiple mutations in so-called quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDR) - two
mutations in GyrA (usually Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn) that are tightly coupled to the presence of at least one
mutation in ParC (usually Ser80Ile). We hypothesize that some clinical E. coli strains are more prone than
others to acquire and, also, to spread or transmit the FQ resistance. Surprisingly, the most common
uropathogenic groups of E. coli appear to demonstrate certain restraints to becoming FQ resistant, probably
due to some physiological barriers for the sequential structural alteration of GyrA and ParC. We discovered
that, instead, that urinary FQ resistant isolates can emerge by acquisition of genes already carrying the full
set of QRDR changes, demonstrating for the first time that high-level FQ resistance can be transmitted
between clinical strains of unrelated clonal groups. This, for example, was the mechanism of recent
emergence of new pandemic FQ resistant clonal group of E. coli – ST1193 that spread globally with last
decade. Here we will study whether there is a clonal association between the ability of clinical E. coli strains
to acquire and spread in nature the full set of QRDR mutations sequentially or, alternatively, by gene transfer
and what could be potential physiological factors that either promote or restrain the FQ resistance
emergence, transmission and spread among uropathogenic E. coli."

Over 100,000 patients of all ages undergo ostomy surgery in the United States (US) annually due to a variety of
pathophysiologic conditions including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis), bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, and many other medical conditions. Ostomy surgery may also
be necessary in cases of severe abdominal or pelvic trauma resulting from accidents or from injuries sustained
during military service. A life-saving procedure, ostomy surgery allows bodily waste to pass through a surgically
created opening called a stoma on the abdomen into a prosthetic known as a ‘pouch’ or ‘ostomy bag’ on the
outside of the body. Patients are discharged from the hospital within days of ostomy creation and expected to
heal at home using disposable ostomy pouches attached to the skin around their stoma. Unfortunately, current
pouch designs offer little therapeutic benefit for post-surgery edema (swelling) and may not maintain a tight seal,
allowing leakage of intestinal fluid and waste. Resulting stoma complications include mucocutaneous
(skin/stoma) separation, stoma retraction, and moisture-associated skin damage. Up to 70% of ostomy patients
endure these complications, with 29% of these patients requiring hospital readmissions at an additional cost of
$78,000 per patient. Furthermore, risks for complications are higher for high body mass index (BMI) patients.
Given the rise in clinical conditions requiring ostomy surgery, the increased BMI of the US population, and the
current reimbursement landscape that penalizes the healthcare system for readmissions, an improved post-
surgical incision management device to prevent ostomy complications is urgently needed. In this SBIR Direct
Phase II, Fistula Solution will develop a novel post-surgical ostomy incision management device designed to
prevent complications, form a tight seal, and protect the new stoma. This device stabilizes the tissue around the
stoma to reduce edema and tension on sutures, along with holding the skin/stoma junction together to facilitate
healing. In addition, the device creates a secure seal to stop stool leaks and prevent MASD. Our specific aims
are to 1) optimize product design for manufacturability and clinical benefits; 2) verify product design and
biocompatibility; and 3) conduct a clinical trial comparing the device to conventional adhesive ostomy pouches
with HealthPartners Institute and Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota. The successful execution of our
specific aims will establish device safety and efficacy and ensure the device is designed for manufacturability
and biocompatibility. The human health benefit is a new standard of care to improve ostomy patient outcomes,
shorten hospital stays, reduce readmissions to hospital, and mitigate a major financial exposure for hospitals."

Vision impairment (VI) is a significant public health problem among older adults. VI impacts a broad range of
activities and is associated with reduced quality of life and poorer physical and mental health. As the population
is aging, VI will become an increasingly important problem. Yet, data on VI in the oldest old (aged 80+) are
limited. Available data suggest that a significant proportion of older adults have uncorrected refractive error
(URE) – a condition that is easily addressed with spectacles – as well as vision-limiting cataract. While distance
visual acuity is the most commonly measured aspect of VI, contrast sensitivity (CS; the ability to differentiate
objects in low light settings) is also important for many activities. However, few population-based studies have
measured contrast sensitivity in older adults; data are needed to understand the impact of distance acuity and
contrast sensitivity deficits in the oldest old.
In this study, we will add distance visual acuity and CS tests to an already funded, one-time visit in the homes of
4,200 older women who have participated in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) for nearly 30 years. These data
will be used to characterize the prevalence of VI in the oldest old (Aim 1) and to assess the impact of VI on
social, psychosocial, cognitive, and physical health indicators (Aim 2). Given the unique opportunity to link to an
ongoing cohort, we will be able to describe cross-sectional associations (Aim 2a) and to prospectively evaluate
trajectories of functional decline (Aim 2b). Additionally, we will utilize the WHI-Medicare claims link to analyze
associations between VI and healthcare utilization and costs (Aim 2c). We will recommend eye care for
individuals with VI and will characterize differences between those who seek care vs. those who do not and will
examine reported barriers to care (Aim 3a). By engaging a patient care navigator, we aim to help facilitate care
for those who do not initially seek it, and we will evaluate the potential impact of patient care navigation on
improving uptake of needed eye care (Aim 3b).
Adding these vision measures to the rich repository of WHI data provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the
role of VI on a broad range of health domains. Project results will be used to develop interventions to improve
vision health in older adults, with the ultimate goal of extending independence and improving quality of life in
older adults. Renowned vision experts have highlighted the need for obtaining quality estimates of VI in the
oldest old, in order for health systems to prepare for serving the growing population of affected individuals. This
innovative project fills an important gap in our knowledge of VI and its impact on the lives of our society’s oldest
members."

This K23 application presents a training and research program that will support the applicant on a path towards
becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused on understanding the neurobiology of the olfactory
system in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Training: The activities in this application build on the candidate’s prior
clinical neuropsychology training and research experience and are set in a resource-rich environment that will
foster his development of expertise in 1) principles of functional imaging in AD, 2) mechanisms and neural
circuitry of the olfactory system, 3) biostatistics and psychometrics, and 4) responsible conduct of research.
These training goals will be supported by a combination of didactics, formal advisory plans, and hands-on-
practicum throughout the award period. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Davangere Devanand,
his co-mentor Dr. Terry Goldberg, scientific advisors (Drs. Gaurav Patel, Prasanna Karunanayaka, Mark
Albers, Jonas Olofsson, and Scott Small), and peer mentor (Dr. Jonathan Overdevest), the candidate will
acquire advanced skills in neuroimaging methodologies, olfactory evaluations, and AD biomarker mechanics
that will be directly applied to this proposal. Research: The overarching goal of the research to be carried out in
this application is to determine the neural mechanisms underlying odor memory deficits, and to define the
relationship between odor memory and AD biomarkers using a new process-pure variant of an odor memory
test. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop tools for enhancing early detection of AD. Olfaction and
memory are systems in which impairments develop during initial stages of AD. Odor memory, which combines
these two systems, has potential for improving upon the capabilities of existing tools which commonly measure
either system in isolation. Currently, the precise neural substrates of odor memory remain undefined. By
investigating the brain activation patterns involved in odor memory, there is promise for enhancing our ability to
identify individuals at risk for decline. This proposal will be the first to evaluate odor detection and odor memory
jointly within the same imaging paradigm. Aim 1 of the research project will examine fMRI task-related signal in
the olfactory cortex and medial temporal lobe during an fMRI odor memory procedure. Patients with AD,
patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively intact older adults will undergo scanning. Aim
2 strives to establish the association of abnormal odor memory with apolipoprotein genotype and plasma tau
biomarkers. In Aim 3, the clinical utility of odor memory for differentiating groups (patients with AD, patients
with mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively intact older adults) will be compared against established odor
identification and verbal memory measures."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable brain disorder that currently debilitates more than 40 million
people worldwide. Clinically, AD typically presents as a slow and progressive decline in cognitive performance
that inevitably culminates in severe dementia. AD is confirmed postmortem by dementia with amyloid beta (Aβ)
peptides plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing the hyper-phosphorylated Tau protein. A
situation which proves that the normal pathways required for protein degradation are impaired in AD brain. It is
generally accepted that plaques and tangles play complex roles in AD and that changes in Aβ metabolism
precipitate a damaging cascade upstream of tau pathology and neurodegeneration. However, our
understanding of plaque diversity and how this relates to NFTs has remained limited. Notably, the relevance of
Aβ and amyloid plaques in AD has seen a recent resurgence in FDA approvals and activities. For example, the
FDA recently approved aducanumab that can remove amyloid plaques as measured by positron-emission
tomography. Although the importance of amyloid plaques in AD have long been recognized, exactly how
plaques develop over time, the extent of their diversity, and their relationship to NFTs is not well understood.
Therefore, it is of great importance to map the trajectory of distinct classes of amyloid aggregates in brains with
amyloid or both amyloid and NFT pathology.
 The project leaders recently discovered several important and early events in the formation of
Aβ plaques in AD model brains and have developed several new approaches to study these processes. First,
we discovered that impaired protein homeostasis in axon terminals represents a pioneering synaptic defect in
mice modeling the early stage of amyloid pathology in AD. Second, we found that proteins localizing to axon
terminals have selectively hampered turnover through plaque dependent and independent mechanisms. Third,
formation of structurally distinct plaques are associated with differential Aβ peptide deposition. Finally, Aβ42
comprises the initial core structure followed by radial outgrowth and later incorporation of Aβ38. To rigorously
extend these findings, in Aim 1 we will deeply characterize amyloid plaque diversity in mouse model brains.
The goal of Aim 2 is to determine how the presence of NFTs influence amyloid plaque dynamics. The
proposed research will advance our understanding of AD by characterizing amyloid plaques based on
aggregation kinetics, what structural Aβ assemblies are formed, how these oligomers and plaques trigger
mechanisms leading to downstream synaptic dysfunction, and how these properties of amyloid plaques are
modulated by NFTs."
10805414,"SUMMARY. Salivary gland cancer (SGC) is an orphan disease for which no targeted therapies are approved.
SGCs are divided into histotypes, the most common being adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and mucoepidermoid
carcinoma (MEC). We have generated one of the largest reported SGC PDX banks including major histotypes
like ACC and the first reported PDX models of MEC. Our SGC PDX bank includes several cases from the same
patient, collected after subsequent relapses, which has allowed an exploration of the acquisition of oncogenic
gene events. Similar to other reports, our SGC models had low mutation burden by whole exome sequencing,
and RNA-seq analysis identified known (MYB-NFIB), novel (NFIB-MTFR2), and even dual gene fusions in ACC
cases that gave rise to oncogenic fusion protein products. Other genetic events in SGC clustered in the PI3K
and mTOR pathways, which impinge upon protein synthesis. Both MEC and ACC overexpress key transcription
factors such as Myc or SOX2 that dictated tumorigenicity and growth in SGC. Overall, we propose that protein
synthesis is an unexplored target in SGC. SVC112 is a small molecule that inhibits protein synthesis at the
elongation step by inhibiting eEF2. In our seminal studies where SVC112 was first reported, protein synthesis
and growth inhibition were associated; SVC112 had greater effect on cancer over non-cancer cells; SVC112
depleted SOX2, Myc, and Cyclin D1, and arrested growth in vivo. In both ACC and MEC cell lines we found that
SVC112 inhibits both native Myb and the protein products of MYB fusions and key proteins like Myc. SVC112
inhibited proliferation and sphere formation in both ACC and MEC in vitro assays, and had notable single agent
activity (including actual tumor shrinkage) in 2 ACC PDX, one with a MYB fusion and another one showing non-
fusion mediated Myb upregulation. We propose to study the role of oncogenic fusions in SGC, the mechanism
of action of SVC112 in SGC, and the efficacy of SVC112 in complex SGC models. First, we will catalogue and
prioritize MYB fusions from large patient and PDX cohorts. Then, to understand key genetic events we will insert
fusions in non-cancer cell lines, and deploy CRISPR and lentiviral vectors in fusion-and non-fusion-bearing SGC
cell lines, respectively; we will also test SVC112 inhibition to add an additional layer of testing of the impact of
protein modulation. The hypothesis that SVC112’s selective effect is due to selective depletion of key proteins
will be tested by ribosome profiling (to identify mRNA targets) and proteomics analysis (to identify proteins
targets). Lastly, we will test the in vivo efficacy of SVC112 using both native SGC PDX models bearing MYB and
other fusions and wild-tpy, as well as in vivo models with the CRISPR-depleted MYB fusions strains. Overall our
goal is to examine dependence on fusion events vs protein overexpression by other molecular mechanisms for
SVC112 susceptibility. This project will propel the translation of SVC112, a new drug for SGC discovered in
Colorado, by dissecting the basis for its effect and therapeutic window, and identifying its efficacy in advanced
SGC models with a plan that enables identification of which subset of SGC patients may derive more benefit."

10915725,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cocaine abuse continues to be a national crisis, with the cost of addiction to illegal drugs in the United States
related to criminal activity, lost work productivity, and medical care totaling more than $740 billion per year. In
particular, African-Americans, who make up 13.4% of the U.S. population, disproportionately bear the burden of
cocaine use and overdoses. Multiple studies have shown that prolonged use of cocaine affects the gut microbiota,
which in turn alters hypothalamus-pituitary-axis activity and emotional behavior. Cocaine-related studies have
shown that drugs of abuse trigger preferential proliferation of gram-positive Firmicutes and reduction of gram-
negative Bacteroidetes, results that are consistent with microbiota associations with drug addiction. Accumulating
evidence also shows that gut microorganisms influence the bidirectional communication along the gut-
brain axis, which indicates the crucial role of the gut microbiota on cocaine. Since evidence exists for the influence
of commonly abused drugs on the microbiota gut-brain axis, the transverse colon, the distal ileum, the basal
ganglia, and the pituitary and adrenal glands may have potential roles as biomarkers, specifically in
overdose cases, due to the damage to these tissues caused by cocaine abuse. In this proposal, we will address
the impact that cocaine has on the microbiota of the gut-brain axis. Our approach will allow for evaluation of
microbial signatures in microbiota gut-brain axis-associated tissues using specimens extracted from cocaine
overdose cadavers, an approach that previous studies have not used but could provide information that helps
determine how people respond differently to cocaine, allowing researchers to better examine the potential
adverse effects of microbes. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that there is a significant association
between gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in cocaine overdose cases from three Southern regions - Alabama,
Florida, and Tennessee. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) determine whether the gut microbiome that is
associated with the transverse colon and distal ileum mediates the relationship between cocaine use and lethal
drug intoxication in African Americans from Southern regions of the United States; (2) determine whether the gut
microbiome that is associated with the basal ganglia and the pituitary and adrenal glands mediates the
relationship between cocaine use and lethal drug intoxication in African Americans from Southern regions of the

10848221,"Project Summary/Abstract - Overall
This integrated program project was pursuant to the discovery of naturally occurring, partially glycosylated
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) glycoforms by the Bousfield laboratory. Two of these glycoforms possessed 3
of 4 N-glycans, exhibited greater biological activity, and were more abundant than fully-glycosylated FSH in young
women. Furthermore, hypo-glycosylated FSH variants exhibited an age-dependent decrease concomitant with
a well-known decline in fertility in women. Projects are organized to reflect the recognition of the importance of
the development of numerous mouse genetic models in previous funding periods inspired by biochemical
advances in understanding of the FSH glycoforms, and which now, will inspire in turn, such studies at the
signaling, trafficking, and structural biology levels. In Project 1(Kumar), powerful genetic models now make it
possible to study each specific glycoform independently, both by injection of purified glycoform preparations into
Fshb-null mice as well as in transgenic mice expressing FSH18, FSH21, or FSH24. Advances in single-cell
RNA-sequencing coupled with a transgenic line that expresses green fluorescent protein specifically in
gonadotropes permit evaluation of the more than 50 enzymes responsible for N-linked oligosaccharide
synthesis. Since non-ovarian targets of FSH have raised concerns and confusion for women undergoing IVF,
several mouse models were devised to address questions raised by conflicting experimental outcomes,
beginning with deletion of the Fshr gene, which would effectively eliminate all forms of putative FSHR proteins,
including alternative splicing. In Project 2(Davis), studies involving FSH glycoform signals within primary cultures
of granulosa cells, focus on the disparate responses of ovarian target cells to biased agonists FSH18, FSH21, and
FSH24. Two major, differentially glycoform-regulated transcription factors (TF), CREB and YAP1, will have their
downstream pathways characterized in granulosa cells. Granulosa cells of young and advanced age mice and
women will provide basic information relevant to translational efforts. The interface between FSH and FSHR, both
monomeric and oligomeric receptor forms, will be studied in Project 3(Jonas). Activation of cAMP accumulation
is now known to involve FSHR dynamics that will be evaluated, including internalization. FSH glycoforms are
anticipated to alter FSHR conformation to varying degrees, leading to biased agonist signals. Project
4(Bousfield) will incorporate FSHR into lipid nanodiscs to provide a means to evaluate glycoform-FSHR-
membrane interactions, using cryogenic electron microscopy (cyro-EM). This has been done with LH and TSH
receptors (LHR & TSHR) and those studies have revealed the ligand binding site undergoes a major rotation,
lifting it away from the membrane, during receptor activation. The location of FSH oligosaccha-rides is on the
back side of the hormone, away from the hormone-receptor interface, which suggests interaction with the cell
membrane or membrane proteins. Taken together, the projects integrate FSH glycoform signaling at
overlapping levels ranging from the intact organism to the glycosylated hormone itself."

The Administrative Core, Core A, is the focal point for the four Projects and two other Cores comprising the
Program Project. As in the previous funding periods, Core A will reside on the Wichita State University (WSU)
campus with Drs. George Bousfield and Jeffrey May serving as Core A Lead and Co-Lead, respectively. Core
A will coordinate, facilitate, and integrate the activities of the Projects and Cores. Aim 1: Provide routine
administrative support to Project 4(Bousfield) and Core B(May), both located at Wichita State University,
and support Projects and Cores at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus (UCD),
Aurora, CO, the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Omaha, NE, and King’s College London
(KCL), UK as needed to prepare Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPRs) and grant
applications for this P01. Core A will provide routine administrative support to WSU participants and support
Projects and Cores at the three other project performance sites: UCD (Project 1: Kumar), UNMC (Project 2:
Davis and Core C: Guda), and KCL (Project 3: Jonas) as needed. Core A will work with administrative offices
at WSU to issue sub-awards and oversee budgetary matters regarding the two other regional campuses, UCD
and UNMC and one foreign campus, KCL. Aim 2: Coordinate communication among Projects and Core
Labs located at four separate institutions. Core A will organize the regular Program video conferences where
recent progress and research findings are discussed, and administrative issues are decided. Aim 3: Provide
oversight of Project via internal and external reviews. Core A will organize annual Program meetings
including: the External Advisory Committee (EAC) meeting which provides an opportunity for the Program’s
external committee members to come together with Project Leads, Core Leads, and others to review Program
progress and provide feedback; and the Spring Program Scientific Retreat where all research components of
the Program meet to review progress with the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and chart the next year’s goals.
Aim 4: Facilitate communication of results with scientific community. Core A will generate reports and
other paperwork relating to the Program Project for the NIH and institutional offices as needed. Core A will assist
in the preparation of manuscripts generated by the Projects as needed and will assess relevance of research
meetings for data presentation in consultation with the Projects and other Cores."
11047489,"Project Abstract
All persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) will experience behavioral symptoms of
dementia (BSD). Management of BSD is one of the most frequent daily tasks caregivers perform, which includes
deciding when to administer an “as needed” medication to address BSD. Non-pharmacologic strategies are the
recommended first-line approach to manage BSD, though “as needed” medications can be warranted when non-
pharmacologic strategies fail and the BSD are either causing distress to the care recipient or jeopardizing the
physical safety of the care recipient or caregiver. Conversely, chemical restraint means a drug is being
administered to make care more convenient for the caregiver, not because it is medically indicated. Our team
has reported that 22% of ADRD family caregivers inappropriately administer medications as chemical restraints.
Importantly, there are no evidence-based indications for pharmacotherapeutic management of a patient
symptom for the benefit of a caregiver, aside from safety. Thus, this high prevalence is concerning, and
represents an emerging public health crisis and major gap in knowledge. Given the novelty of this newly
described phenomenon, the purpose of this study is to describe patterns of medication administration, chemical
restraint, and associated mortality outcomes in ADRD family caregiving. To address this, we will conduct a 31-
day micro-longitudinal study in which family caregivers (N=300) complete daily diaries describing BSD
management including use of non-pharmacologic strategies and medications. These data will be supplemented
with personal characteristics of the caregivers obtained through an enrollment survey, clinical characteristics of
care recipients found in their EHR and combined with vital records data on the care recipient’s mortality. This
proposed study will implement an innovative algorithm to classify medication administration as medically
indicated, potentially inappropriate and chemical restraint in consideration of non-pharmacologic strategies tried,
safety concerns, and distress of the care recipient (Aim 1). This study will also characterize patterns of chemical
restraint to create typologies and determine characteristics of chemical restraint users (Aim 2), and determine
the relationship between chemical restraint use and 1-year mortality of the care recipient (Aim 3). This study is
the first step towards creating sensitive clinical assessments to identify situations at high risk of adverse
outcomes related to caregiving practices. This foundational work will support a long-term research goal to
evaluate if randomizing caregivers to screening for chemical restraint results in greater reduced morbidity and
mortality for care recipients than the observed harms."
10840299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite their diminutive length, 20-30-nucleotide-long small RNAs affect nearly all developmental and disease
processes, from fertility in flies to cancer in humans. Small RNA associate with Argonaute proteins to direct
sequence-specific degradation or translational repression of matching mRNAs in a process called RNA
interference (RNAi). Small RNAs can also function in an alternative mode to promote gene expression. Within
the germline of the tiny nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, two broad classes of small RNAs – piwi-
interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) – interact with nearly all genes, silencing
some and promoting the expression of others. Remarkably, some piRNAs and siRNAs are transmitted from
one generation to the next, providing a heritable mechanism for regulating gene expression without changes to
the underlying DNA. In C. elegans, piRNAs and siRNAs are required for optimal fertility and germline
immortality. We and others identified a role for maternally-derived piRNAs and siRNAs in protecting essential
genes from silencing. We also showed that these small RNAs have a role in establishing proper gene
expression in the embryo that is crucial throughout development, although the mechanism underlying this
phenomenon requires further study. To identify the roles of piRNAs and siRNAs in ensuring proper gene
expression from one generation to the next, we will address two related questions: 1) How do piRNAs and
siRNAs regulate gene expression to promote fertility and germline immortality? and 2) What are the molecular
roles of maternally deposited piRNAs and siRNAs? A second area of my research centers on gene regulatory
mechanisms involving a third class of small RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). We recently uncovered a
distinct branch of the miRNA pathway required for proper developmental timing and optimal fertility in the
germline. How this pathway regulates gene expression is an important area of future research. This relates to
the third question we will address: 3) How do miRNAs regulate developmental timing in the germline? miRNAs
are processed from a limited number of transcripts that form hairpin-like secondary structures. The hairpin itself
is not sufficient to mark a transcript for processing, and in many species, including humans, primary transcripts
contain additional sequence elements that promote miRNA formation. Not all miRNA transcripts contain these
elements and in some animals, including C. elegans, they are completely lacking. We developed a sensor that
reports on miRNA transcript recognition. Using the sensor, we will address a fourth question: 4) How are
miRNA transcripts distinguished from other RNAs in C. elegans? The ease in which genetics, genome editing,
and genomics assays can be done in C. elegans makes it an ideal system to address these four questions.
The mechanism of miRNA formation and the molecular roles of miRNAs, piRNAs, and siRNAs are highly
conserved in animals. The knowledge gained through this study will have important implications in our
understanding of the counterparts in humans and how their dysfunction contributes to sterility and disease."
10835926,"The goals of the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Combined Engineering and Orthopaedics Training
Program are to identify, train, and empower a select group of high potential investigators to utilize the
principles of engineering to advance patient care through interdisciplinary research while nurturing them to
become successful academic and clinical leaders in the musculoskeletal and orthopaedic sciences. These
goals will be achieved by: (i) carefully selecting exceptional and highly motivated pre-doctoral and post-
doctoral trainees, (ii) providing them with unique training, mentoring, and research opportunities adapted to a
sub-specialty academic hospital, and (ii) placing an emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches and focused
mentoring to address clinically relevant research problems. Applications to fill two pre-doctoral positions will be
invited from diverse graduate students in the School of Engineering at Cornell University. Trainee selection is
based on outstanding performance in an existing mandatory summer ‘immersion’ term at HSS, a strong
supporting letter by an HSS-based clinical collaborator, and a commitment to spend a minimum of one full
semester at HSS. Applications for two post-doctoral positions will be invited from: (i) high caliber and diverse
residents identified by HSS Clinical Service Chiefs and the Training Program Executive Steering Committee as
rising-stars capable of pursuing clinician-scientist career pathways, and (ii) PhD post-doctoral fellows who have
demonstrated exemplary potential through prior grant support, highly cited peer-reviewed publications, and
strong cross-disciplinary collaborations. Additional key selection criteria for all positions are strong research
plans that meet the mission of the Training Program, a desire to pursue an academic career, and a strong
preceptor. A key strength to the training program is the central and unifying 40+ year relationship between
HSS and the School of Engineering at Cornell University. This relationship has been recently reorganized into
a revitalized cross-institutional center: CAMEO (Center for Advanced Materials and Engineering in
Orthopaedics) from which Training Program preceptors are drawn. Preceptors include scientists and clinician-
scientists with strong track records of conducting federally-funded research applying engineering principles
aimed at improving patient care through basic and translational research. Trainees benefit from a strong
mentoring program and a dedicated Mentorship Committee, extensive core services, expanded capabilities in
epidemiology and biostatistics, institutional patient registries, and newly created Regenerative Medicine and
Genomics Research Centers that traverse our research and clinical departments. A 10+ year collaboration with
Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), and especially the WCM Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC),
provides formal coursework, seminars and symposia. In summary, our rich resources will be leveraged and
choreographed across our pre- and post-doctoral Training Program to provide a unique training experience
and position our trainees to develop successful independent careers in the orthopaedic sciences."
10850650,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The work proposed is designed to understand how gene expression control at the transcriptional level
results from alterations in the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Escherichia coli RNAP serves as an
exceptional model system for mechanistic studies of transcription and as a paradigm for understanding gene
expression in bacteria. Bacteria live in complex, fluctuating environments requiring gene expression to be
highly responsive to changes in growth state or environmental conditions. The expression of a given gene is
determined by contributions from the sequence of the DNA template, regulatory proteins, and reaction
conditions. While the input provided by DNA sequence is “hard-coded” (barring mutational change), the inputs
provided by regulatory factors and reaction conditions are flexible, enabling them to change in response to
alterations in environmental conditions. A multitude of transcription factors and reaction conditions can
modulate gene expression. Thus, changes in gene expression occurring in response to alterations in growth
state or environmental conditions cannot be predicted a priori from DNA sequence alone. Experiments
proposed will enable a systems-level description of the sequence-dependent, factor-dependent, condition-
dependent transcriptional landscape in Escherichia coli. Each step of transcription can be rate limiting, and
thus serve as a potential target of regulation. During the project period, mechanisms of transcriptional control
during initial transcription and elongation, i.e., the stages when RNA synthesis occurs, will be investigated. In
future work, studies will expand to include initiation and termination, using similar approaches. A distinguishing
feature of the work described has been the development of methods to monitor transcription across extensive
sequence space, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the flexibility provided by use of E. coli RNAP as a model
system, enables straightforward analysis of the contributions of any transcription factor or reaction condition to
RNAP activity, both in vitro and in vivo. The results of empirical measurements of RNAP activity across
extensive sequence space or across the entire E. coli genome will be integrated into a site- and base-specific
quantitative model describing how RNAP activity is specified by inputs from DNA sequence, transcription
factors, and conditions. The biological knowledge gained will provide an unprecedently rich description of the
architecture of gene expression control in E. coli and provide the basis for extending this approach to other
organisms, including eukaryotes."

The Cancer Control and Population Sciences (CCPS) Program is a realigned, unified program of the former
Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention and Health Behavior and Outcomes programs. CCPS members pursue
research in epidemiology, prevention and risk reduction, behavioral interventions, cancer care delivery, and
methods development, along with implementation science and policy research. The program is comprised of
72 members from 22 different departments and six schools with total annual direct research support of $17.7
million of which $12.7 million (72%) is from the NCI. Members are highly productive with 1,407 publications
during the project period (19.5% inter-programmatic, 26.3% intra-programmatic), and 1,272 participants were
enrolled in clinical trials. CCPS’s aims and strengths are closely aligned with the Rogel Cancer Center’s broad-
based themes, strategic vision, and mission via the program’s focus on team science, its commitment to
understanding cancer etiology, improving primary prevention and early detection strategies, and improving
cancer care delivery. The CCPS program has three main specific aims: 1) Identify key environmental, lifestyle,
genetic, and socio-structural targets for cancer prevention, risk reduction, improved detection, and better
outcomes; 2) Develop, test, and deploy innovative strategies to reduce the burden of cancer; and 3) Create
and apply novel scientific approaches to cancer control and population science research across the continuum."
10875464,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT)
The Rogel Cancer Center (Rogel) Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) broadly supports the
center’s mission to reduce the burden of cancer and advance health equity in our catchment area (CA) via
transdisciplinary research, education, patient care and community outreach. Rogel COE leads all aspects of the
center’s COE efforts, including strategic planning, establishing and propelling the specific aims, launching new
initiatives and evaluating the impact of COE activities. During the last period, Rogel expanded its CA to the entire
State of Michigan. The decision to expand the CA is aligned with an expanded University of Michigan (U-M)
clinical enterprise as well as new collaborations with Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) communities and
partnerships with rural and Native American populations outside of our prior CA, along with new community-
based research and intervention activities across the full State. The decision on expansion was also based on
input from the Rogel Community Advisory Board (RCAB) and External Advisory Board (EAB). Our statewide CA
comprises ~10 million residents (versus 5 million in the prior CA), who are more diverse than those of the prior
CA; now 76% White and 14% Black compared to 84% White and 9% Black, previously. The statewide CA also
has a higher percentage of Hispanic residents – 5.6% now compared to 4% previously – and the percent of
Native American (<1%) and Asian (~3%) residents remains the same. Overall, age-adjusted cancer mortality
rates are higher in Michigan than the US (166/100,00 vs. 156/100,000), with Michigan ranked 13th worst in the
country for cancer mortality. We have identified key behavioral risk factors along with nine priority cancers that
inform and shape our goals for impact and our research, training, education, and outreach efforts. The risk factors
are: colorectal cancer screening, cigarette and alcohol use, physical activity and obesity, and poor mental and
physical health. The priority cancers are: bladder, breast, colon, liver, lung, myeloma, prostate, pancreas and
uterine cancer. The Rogel COE has four main specific aims: 1) Describe the CA and its population; 2) Define
the cancer burden and priority cancers in the CA; disseminate this information within the Rogel and broadly
across our CA in partnership with our Community Advisory Board and key organizations across the state; 3)
Drive and support Rogel programmatic research as well as education efforts to address CA priority cancers and
risk factors; and 4) Conduct education and service programs that meet the needs of our CA residents and
address key disparities in incidence, mortality and risk factors."
10886503,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine that coordinates cytokine production, inflammation, cell
survival, and cell death. How life and death decisions are made in response to TNF is not completely understood.
Several molecular events determine whether TNF stimulation of cells leads to a transcriptional response that
promotes cell survival or whether it can lead to cell death. Signaling downstream of the TNF receptor is heavily
regulated by post-translation modifications including ubiquitination. LUBAC, a ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligase consisting
of Sharpin, HOIL and HOIP, is the only Ub ligase described to date that can modify proteins with linear Ub chains
(Met1-Ub chains). LUBAC activity is essential for NF-kB dependent transcription of prosurvival genes upon TNF
stimulation. Cells derived from patients with germline mutations in LUBAC components elicit defective NF-kB-
dependent gene transcription and aberrant activation of cell death pathways. Similarly, murine models with
defective LUBAC components elicit chronic inflammation and increased apoptosis in multiple organs and tissues.
Our published studies indicate that cell death, rather than a deficiency in NF-kB dependent gene transcription,
in LUBAC-deficient (sharpincpdm) animals is driving the TNF-dependent chronic inflammation as this phenotype
is reversed by a compound deficiency in FADD—an important component of the death inducing signaling
complex. This insight led us to the hypothesis that LUBAC activity is directly required for the prevention of cell
death. In aim 1, we will address the molecular basis for LUBAC modification of protein targets with Met1-Ub
chains. We will address how LUBAC can modify FADD with Met1-Ub chains. In aim 2, we will characterize the
functional relevance of FADD modification in cells and use a new Ub-based tool to enrich for Met1-Ub chains. In
aim 3, we will investigate the function of LUBAC auto-ubiquitination and how phosphorylation can regulate
LUBAC’s linear Ub chain forming activity. Our studies will provide mechanistic insight into the etiology of primary
immune deficiencies associated with patients with germline mutations in LUBAC components."

This is a new application for an Institutional Training Grant in the basic and clinical aspects of
Neurological Disorders caused by HIV, better known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(HAND). The Training Program in NeuroHIV (TPNH) is requesting support for 4 advanced
predoctoral students who will be trained in research on how HIV causes neural injury by faculty
actively participating in the Neuroscience and Immunology programs at Georgetown University.
The purpose of this training program is to prepare scientists to investigate molecular and cellular
mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes as well as the immunological responses triggered
by HIV. Our goal is to train researchers on the basic science aspect of developing
neurotherapeutics and/or treatment strategies to reduce the neuronal and glial impairments that
result from HIV infection of the brain. An experienced and well-funded group of 22 faculty
members with a wide range of research interests and expertise in CNS function,
neurodegeneration, virology and immunology will participate in the Ph.D. training program. Most
students will enter graduate school through the Georgetown University Interdisciplinary Program
in Neuroscience (IPN). In the first year they will take course work and rotate through the
laboratories of potential mentors. In the second year, those interested in the TPNH will take
specifically relevant courses dealing with neurodegenerative disorders, immunology, and
immunopathogenesis of HIV infection, as well as extended integrative reasoning and statistical
literacy training, and professional development training (i.e., grant writing and presentation skills).
In the second year of graduate school, students will formally apply to the TPNH with the outline
of a thesis research proposal approved by a potential mentor or co-mentors from the
IPN/Immunology Training Faculty. Thesis research will start after the completion of the Ph.D.
program’s qualifying exam. In their third and fourth years, trainees will participate in training
sessions with clinician-scientists to provide the necessary experience in basic and clinical science
that is key to the understanding of HAND from bench to therapeutics. Trainees will report results
from their research in yearly student seminars, presentations at national meetings, and as
publications in peer-reviewed journals. With respect to public health, this program will create a
core of neuroscientists trained for research and/or management of research programs, through
which new and more effective treatments for HAND and related neuro-immuno-degenerative
disorders will be developed."

Biological knowledgebases are a critical resource for researchers and accelerate scientific discoveries by
providing manually curated, machine-readable data collections. However, the aggregation and manual curation
of biological data is a labor-intensive process that relies almost entirely on professional biocurators. Two
approaches have been advanced to help with this problem: natural language processing (NLP; text mining (TM)
and machine learning (ML)) and engagement of researchers (community curation). However, neither of these
approaches alone is sufficient to address the critical need for increased efficiency in the biocuration process. Our
solution to these challenges is an NLP-enhanced community curation portal, Author Curation to Knowledgebase
(ACKnowledge). The ACKnowledge system, currently implemented for the C. elegans literature, couples
statistical methods and text mining algorithms to enhance community curation of research articles. We propose
to strengthen and expand ACKnowledge by including other species into our pipeline, incorporating more
sophisticated machine learning models, and presenting sentence-level entity and concept extraction for more
detailed author curation. In addition, we will develop an Author Curation Portal (ACP) to allow authors to easily
upload and curate their own documents. Taken together, these enhancements will allow us to maximize
community curation efforts by leveraging author expertise in multiple areas of biology, while at the same time
supporting authors with as much AI-assisted curation as possible. This reciprocal interaction will improve not
only the content of knowledgebases, but the AI methods themselves, as we will receive valuable feedback on our
models. By developing an Author Curation Portal, we will further empower authors to participate in the curation
process and alert knowledgebases to key information that can, and should, be readily discoverable in accordance
with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles."

 Transgender and nonbinary (TNB) people are disproportionately affected by HIV, with increasing
numbers of new diagnoses from 2015-2019. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has great potential to reduce
new HIV infections, but has yet to improve HIV disparities among TNB populations. With the recent FDA
approval of long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) for PrEP, there is a critical opportunity to leverage this
scientific advance to increase PrEP use in TNB populations. In prior work, we piloted a flexible, low-
threshold, trans-affirming PrEP clinic (Bridge Clinic) which achieved higher PrEP uptake and reached TNB
individuals at higher risk for HIV acquisition than those receiving PrEP in gender affirming primary care clinics.
Key components of the Bridge Clinic model include a nurse-led PrEP clinic with flexible hours; PrEP
support provided by a trans peer navigator; text-messaging support via PrEPmate, a CDC-endorsed
evidence based intervention; transportation support; and a TNB community-led PrEP awareness
campaign. In this proposal, we will use Rapid-Cycle Research (RCR) methods to enhance the Bridge Clinic
to incorporate CAB-LA delivery, refine this model through iterative adaptations, and assess key implementation
outcomes. We will also evaluate for any drug interactions between gender affirming hormones and CAB-LA, an
important question to address for the TNB community. In aim 1, we will conduct a series of nominal groups
with English- and Spanish-speaking TNB people and semi-structured interviews with their providers to explore
patient- and provider-identified barriers and facilitators to CAB-LA delivery in the TNB community. We will also
elicit feedback on our implementation strategies to guide the enhancement of our protocol and engagement
approaches to incorporate CAB-LA. In aim 2, we will implement the CAB-LA Enhanced Bridge Clinic model
in an open cohort of 200 TNB individuals over a 3-year period, with mid-course adaptations guided by the RCR
process. Using the RE-AIM framework, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation,
and maintenance of the Enhanced Bridge Clinic model via surveys and interviews with providers, staff, and
patients, and medical record data review. In aim 3, we will enroll a subset of participants receiving injectable
PrEP at the Bridge Clinic into two pharmacokinetic substudies to evaluate the bidirectional effects of gender
affirming hormone therapy and cabotegravir plasma concentrations in TNB individuals. Our work across aims
will be guided by a Stakeholder Advisory Board comprised of local and national community activists, leaders,
health professionals, and staff serving the TNB community who will meet quarterly to provide input on study
design and implementation, prioritization of adaptations, and ensuring the Bridge Clinic model is generalizable
to other practice settings. Upon study completion, we will have optimized and evaluated a novel PrEP delivery
model to increase uptake and persistence to long-acting injectable PrEP in TNB people, and assessed for drug
interactions between gender affirming hormones and CAB-LA in a real-world cohort of TNB individuals."

Alzheimer's Disease (ISAVRAD). The AC will oversee the entire scientific direction of the U-19, manage its
resources, and integrate the scientific research activities of the four Projects with the service activities of the six
Cores. Operationally, the AC, in collaboration with the Clinical Core, will manage the transfer of samples from
collection sites to the pertinent Cores, manage relationships between the sequencing centers and DNA
repositories, oversee compliance and harmonization at international sites, and coordinate the activities of the
Cores, including their data/materials exchanges with the scientific Projects. Five established committees will
oversee the activities of the AC: Leadership, Long- Term Planning, Scientific Administrative, Fiscal &
Management Oversight, and Publications. The aims of the AC are four-fold. First, we will manage the ISAVRAD
and its internal relationships with the leaders of the Cores and Projects, including the leaders at the 5 data
collection sites. Specifically, the AC will establish and revisit timely program priorities, optimize the sharing of
resources among Cores and Projects, review data and specimen management needs, communicate scientific
advances, promote scientific relationships and collaborations with other aging programs within the ISAVRAD
network, and oversee ethical and legal issues (IRB etc.). Second, the CC will manage ISAVRAD relationships
external to ISAVRAD, including communicating with the External Advisory Committee members,
communicating, coordinating and collaborating with other aging studies to identify new and emerging areas of
scientific inquiry relevant to the goals of ISAVRAD; oversee the preparation of annual progress reports for the
National Institute on Aging; oversee the sharing of resources with investigators at outside institutions (e.g.,
data/material usage agreements); promote outreach to community residents at all recruitment sites to
disseminate current topics on health, ADRD, and lifestyles, and disseminate scientific findings to the research
community. Third, the AC will work with the Clinical, Neuroimaging, and Data Management and Statistics
Cores to ensure harmonization of recruitment, data collection, data storage and management, and
data/materials transfers throughout the ISAVRAD consortium. Fourth, the AC will oversee faculty development
activities at each academic center affiliated with this U-19, including structured in-person mentoring and
attendance at meetings/conferences."
10907424,"The ISAVRAD U19 proposes a five-site, two-arm (patients and controls), longitudinal (3 assessments/subject)

and women (~50:50 ratio) who are > 60 years of age and either have a history of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) test positive COVID-19 infection (75% of sample) or have no history of COVID-19 (25% of sample).
Evaluations will be performed upon enrollment, 18 months, and 36 months. Evaluations will comprise a
standardized data acquisition battery including assessment of clinical status and serum sampling for fluid-based
biomarkers and genetics. Neuroimaging will be conducted at enrollment and at 18 months. Data acquisition,
preprocessing, archiving and sharing – both within the U19 and with the scientific community at large – will be
overseen by the Administrative, Clinical, Neuroimaging, and Data Management & Statistics Cores of the U19.
The Neuroimaging Core will manage neuroimaging acquisition (2 assessments/subject), quality control,
harmonization, data archiving and data sharing at all five study sites. Image acquisition, quality control and
harmonization strategies will emulate those of ADNI3 and Mark VCID supplemented by team expertise. Minimal
data preprocessing will use pipelined approaches both volumetric and surface-based. Surface-based analyses
will emulate Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) protocols, with the
expectation that other large studies of the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) will emerge and that
ENIGMA community will embrace the challenge of ongoing data exploration both meta-analytic and mega-
analytic.
Aim 1: Image Acquisition, Harmonization and Quality Control. Structural MRI and functional MRI images will be
acquired at all five study sites. Structural MRI acquisitions will emulate those of ADNI3, UKBioBank, Lifespan
HCP, MarkVCID and GOBS. Functional MRI acquisitions will emulate the latest GOBS. The Neuroimaging Core
will coordinate acquisition across sites, including harmonization and quality control.
Aim 2: Image Preprocessing and Pipeline analytics. The Neuroimaging Core will perform post-acquisition quality
control, image preprocessing (artifact removal, motion correction, etc.), and run widely used volumetric and
surface-based pipeline analyses. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-based indices of neuronal dysfunction
will be cross validated with glucose metabolism and blood flow.
Aim 3: Image Archiving, Access Control, and Sharing. Anonymized raw and processed volumetric and surfaced-

individuals with variable admixture from Southern Texas (Mexican Americans), Seattle (no-tribal Native
Americans) and the Bronx (Hispanic/Latinos and African Americans) using a uniform protocol. Characterization
at baseline includes descriptions of the COVID-19 disease severity, vaccination status, date of documented
infection and identity of the prevalent virus variant at each site at the time of infection and whole genome
sequencing, as well as deep phenotyping and longitudinal follow up of neurological, cognitive and
neuroimaging signatures that may detect cognitive decline or dementia as long-term sequelae of the SARS-
CoV-2 infection. The Data Management and Statistics Core (DM&SC) is one of 4 Cores supporting the
scientific research activities of the four ISAVRAD Program Projects and is responsible for management,
reporting and sharing of raw and meta-data generated by the Clinical and Neuroimaging Cores; from NIA
ADSP components (NCRAD, NIAGADS and GCAD); and from ISAVRAD Projects, to allow completion of the
proposed aims and foster collaboration within and outside the ISVRAD network. Led by the two Informatics
and Statistics Core leaders for the South Texas Alzheimer’s Center, the DM&SC is equipped with advanced
informatics, data management, and statistical infrastructure and expertise to meet these specialized needs.
Drs Zozus and Sanns boast decades of experience providing comprehensive coordinating center support for
clinical studies and offer extensive practical knowledge of regulatory-grade data handling requirements and
methods. Drs. Wang and Himali provide design and analysis expertise. The DM&SC will provide reliable
processes for the recording, management, storing and sharing of data and metadata within and outside the
ISAVRAD network to support the mission of the other cores and foster the completion of the Projects aims and
collaborative efforts, with the goals of aligning ISAVRAD data with appropriate standards to maximize data
reuse (Aim 1); providing information systems and expert support for data and sample collection and
management (Aim 2); and urating and preparing data for external sharing through national repositories."
10907429,"CC Summary Abstract
The proposed Study on Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Ancestral genomic Variations in the
Risk of Alzheimer's Disease (ISAVRAD) requires significant coordination across the five data collection sites
(Argentina, Nigeria, and 3 sites in the US: Texas, NY, and Washington state) and 3 research projects. In
support of the goals of ISAVRAD, the Clinical Core (CC) will enroll and conduct in-depth clinical evaluations of
4,300 older adults with (75% of the sample) and without (25% of the sample) exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at
baseline, and will conduct follow-up evaluations at 18 and 36 months. Clinical evaluations will include medical
and epidemiological histories focused on SARS- CoV-2 infection, including COVID-19 case report forms (CRFs)
harmonized by the WHO, neuropsychological assessment (including Uniform Data Set and a tablet-based,
language-independent assessment), neurological examination, and completion of the semi-structured interview
Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry of the World Health Organization (WHO SCAN), as well
as informant report. At all data collection time-points, the CC will also collect and ship blood biospecimens to
carry out point-of-care COVID-19 antibody testing, extract DNA, and bank whole blood and plasma for future
collaborative studies. It will also screen participants for MRI and harmonize MRI and PET data acquisition at
all sites, sending imaging results to the Neuroimaging Core. The CC will also conduct case conferences to
assign diagnostic clinical outcomes according to cognitive impairment level/ADRD status (unimpaired, Mild
cognitive impairment, dementia syndrome with disease-specific etiologies). Disease specific etiologies will
include AD, Lewy-Body Dementia, Vascular Dementia, Frontal Lobe Dementia, and mixed. Finally, the CC will
employ a sophisticated data capture system, collaboratively developed with the Data Management and
Statistics Core, to provide real- time data transmission to the ISAVRAD database via RedCAP. The CC will be
co-lead by Dr. Gabriel A. de Erausquin Thomas Patterson, Dr. Sudha Seshadri, and Mindy Katz, MPH with the
assistance of site PIs Rufus Akinyemi (Nigeria), Agustin Yecora (Argentina) and Malveeka Sharma (Seattle). In
addition to already having a strong working relationship, they have decades of experience in data collection
from diverse and understudied cohorts, longitudinal data collection, and recruitment of persons with
dementia."
10907432,"P1 Abstract
The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, spread worldwide, resulting in devastating consequences. Our
preliminary data and several published studies strongly suggest that, in adults over 60 years of age, post-
infectious cognitive impairment is present in nearly half of affected people, potentially regardless of the severity
of acute COVID-19 illness. Given the already alarming and increasing numbers of persons with Alzheimer's
dementia and related dementias (ADRD) globally, it is essential that we investigate and understand the degree
and manner and in which SARS-CoV-2 may place older persons at higher risk of progressive cognitive decline
and even ADRD. We have put together an international consortium of investigators uniquely poised to collect
and analyze a broad range of high quality clinical, biomarker, genome, and neuroimaging data. The study,
entitled Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Ancestral genomic Variations in the Risk of
Alzheimer's Disease (ISAVRAD), proposes a five-site, international, two-arm (patients and controls),
longitudinal (baseline, 18 and 36-months) design enrolling 4,300 individuals with and without history of SARS-
CoV-2. Project 1 of ISAVRAD will describe the longitudinal course, epidemiological risk/resiliency factors, and
environmental interactions predictive of cognitive decline and progress to ADRD following SARS-CoV-2
infection in adults over 60 years of age from ancestral and admixed populations. Specifically, Project 1 will
longitudinally compare the rate of cognitive decline in older adults with and without exposure to SARS-CoV-2
infection (Aim 1). We hypothesize that cognitive changes will be progressive in nature and increase rates of
ADRD based on Clinical Dementia Rating scores and neurocognitive performance. For the infected group, we
will compare outcomes by severity of COVID-19 symptoms and the presence and severity of anosmia, under the
hypothesis that that hyposmia/anosmia, but not acute COVID-19 severity, will predict the presence and
likelihood of progression of cognitive impairment and ADRD (Aim 2). Finally, working with the
Neuroimaging,and Projects 2 and3, we will identify predictors of SARS-CoV-2-induced cognitive decline. We
hypothesize that specific symptoms (anosmia-hyposmia) will segregate with related neuroimaging changes (in
the olfactory cortical network) and risk will be influenced by genetic ancestry to predict the highest risk of
cognitive decline and new onset ADRD (Aim 3)."
10873777,"Project Summary:
The Neuroimaging and Electrophysiology Facility (NIEF) was established to increase the competitiveness
of scientists in Puerto Rico via the incorporation of microscopy and electrophysiology techniques in their
research projects. This aim was achieved by the establishment of two research cores, one at the Molecular
Science Research Center (MSRC) and another at the Institute of Neurobiology (INB), from the University
of Puerto Rico. Both facilities support a diversified group of investigators on the island. During phases 1
and 2 of COBRE, the NIEF acquired state-of-the-art instruments that are expensive and not accessible in
most laboratories, departments and/or institutions. Among the equipment obtained or supervised by the
NIEF are confocal, two-photon, and super resolution microscopes. Also available are electrophysiology
rigs for oocytes, cultured cells, brain slice, and anesthetized animals to monitor cell electrical activity. As
a result of the NIEF research infrastructure and expert technical personnel, 113 peer reviewed manuscripts
have been published, leading to 1,816 citations. Moreover, data obtained from the NIEF cores were
included in 84 grant proposals that were submitted to federal, state, and private agencies, and from those
submitted, 48 were funded. Furthermore, research performed in the NIEF permitted the innovation of new
technology by supporting investigators with the development of 7 patents. Finally, over 50 graduate
students from eight different departments and three main research institutions have benefitted from the
NIEF cores by being able to complete at least one of their theses aims and attain their academic degrees,
thus demonstrating the impact of the NIEF in the scientific community of Puerto Rico. These results
confirm the beneficial impact of the NIEF cores on the investigators in the island. Therefore, in this COBRE
phase 3 proposal, the goal is to maintain, strengthen, and support the NIEF cores by implementing three
aims: 1) to provide scientists in Puerto Rico with state-of-the-art instrumentation in microscopy and
electrophysiology, 2) to support the investigators in the island with expert staff that will help them with the
acquisition and analysis of the data from microscopy and electrophysiology techniques, and 3) to train
researchers in several technologies associated with these two approaches (microscopy and
electrophysiology) via seminars, workshop, and hands-on training. Thus, the facilities and services will
continue to help investigators use the most innovative electrophysiological and microscopy technology to
generate interdisciplinary projects to study biological and biophysical phenomena under the guidance of
experienced and excellent staff. Fulfillment of these aims will enable a transition of the NIEF to a
completely self-sustained facility beyond COBRE phase 3 and a role model for Puerto Rico and the
Caribbean."
10873781,"Project Summary/Abstract
The UPR Phases 1 and 2 CCfN significantly contributed to advancement of research in Puerto Rico. A key
component has been the investigator-initiated research projects: Phase 1 and 2 Subprojects, and Phase 2 Pilot
and Collaborative Seed Projects. The CCfN supported a total of 21 investigator-initiated research projects: 10
Subprojects, 4 Pilot, and 7 Seed projects. These projects impacted scientists from 5 institutions and 8 academic
departments. These entailed a rich diversity of Neuroscience research themes, experimental model systems,
approaches and methodology. In terms of scientific productivity COBRE-funded PIs (Subprojects, Pilots and
Seeds) accounted for ~50% of the 113 total publications of the CCfN and contributed to 41% (745) of the citations
total (1816). A total of ~$15M in external funds were obtained by these investigators. Subprojects accounted for
52 of the 83 grants submitted (~63%) and 27 of the 48 funded (~56%). COBRE Phase 2 Pilot and Seed projects
accounted for 37.4% of grants submitted and 43% of grants funded for ~$4,25M or 36.3% of the total external
funds obtained by these projects. Phase 3 CCfN seeks expansion and evolution of investigator-initiated research
into a Research Projects Core (RPC) that further evidences the inherent and emerging synergism between the
CCfN’s Administrative Core, Neuroimaging and Electrophysiology Facilities (NIEF), and Research Projects Core.
Phase 3 RPC specifically aims to: (1) continue providing support for investigator-initiated research
projects in the modalities of Pilot and Seed projects. RPC will continue support of Pilots and Seed projects,
with an expanded potential user population and academic institutions. Scope will also be expanded to more
Neuroscience-related research themes and entrepreneurship. Most importantly, all Seed Projects funds
(5K/Seed, 25K/yr, 125K complete grant cycle) and equipment purchases during the first year of each Pilot project
will derive entirely from institutional commitment funds; (2) further enhance the development of COBRE
investigators’ productivity and competitiveness by their participation in programmatic activities
sponsored by the Administrative and NIEF Cores. Pilot Projects participants are required to participate in the
capabilities’ enhancement activities of the Administrative CORE and other applicable NIEF education and
training sessions; and, (3) sponsor the submission of Neuroplasticity and related neuroscience research
grants to competitive sources of research funding, including individual, multiple-PI, program project or
center grants from other NIH Institutes and Centers, or other Federal and non-Federal entities. We aim to
facilitate submission of multiple-PI, program project, or center grants based on areas of research strength. Given
our diversity of neuroscientists and expertise we envision their coalescence into next-level collaborative research
venues. The RPC will further the programmatic goals of fostering development of researchers, enhancing
competitiveness, promoting continued development of a competitive research culture, and becoming a world-
recognized self-sustainable Center for Neuroplasticity with emerging translational/therapeutic applications."
10852837,"Abstract
 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the main identifiable cause of antibiotic assoicated diarreah. The
incidence of CDI is approximately 677/100,000 patients resulting in close to 500,000 cases annually in the US
alone. CDI causes approximately 25,000 deaths a year and costs the health care system an estimated $6.3
billion/year.
 The main CDI risk factor is aggressive broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Similarly, older populations are
more susceptible to CDI than younger cohorts. Conditions that reduce immunity (e.g. organ transplant,
chemotherapy, AIDS) are also strongly correlated with CDI severity. Importantly, studies have shown that
women have higher risk of CDI than men.
 CDI symptoms range from asymptomatic colonization to mild diarrhea to deathly colitis. All studies that
delineate risk factors associated with CDI have been conducted with infected populations. Hence, the
determinants of individual predisposition to contracting CDI are not well understood. Similarly, it is not clear
why CDI symptoms severity vary among individual patients.
 Mice have been used successfully as a model to test novel approaches to treat for C. difficile infections.
The murine CDI model present symptoms progression reminiscent of human CDI and respond to the same
treatments. During our screening for CDI prophylactics, we observed that female mice developed more severe
CDI signs compared to their male counterpart.
 In this application, we will test the hypothesis that sex hormone levels correlate with CDI symptom
onset and severity. We will also determine whether sex-related variables affect CDI prevention and treatment.
 The data obtained in this project will allow determining the contribution of steroidal sex hormones
and/or sexual status to murine CDI susceptibility. This information will then be used in a follow-up R01
application to determine the mechanisms underlying the differences between male and female CDI
susceptibility."

10868495,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Colorado MD/PhD Program (CU-MSTP) was established in 1983 and has successfully trained
263 dual-degree students to expand the physician-scientist workforce. CU-MSTP has been continuously funded
by NIGMS since 1992, with our program recently growing from ~ 75 students to a current total of 86 students.
Our Program Mission is to train a diverse cadre of dual-degree students to become outstanding physician-
scientists and future leaders in biomedical research. To accomplish this mission, we select students from an
increasing national applicant pool (from 386 in 2017 to 567 in 2021), seeking out those candidates whose record
of research, academic, and leadership achievements are exemplary. CU-MSTP recruits 10-11 diverse applicants
per year from across the nation, being one of two programs serving the nine Mountain West states. CU-MSTP
uses a holistic review process to identify applicants with experiences, attributes, and metrics that project likely
success in our program and as physician scientists. Our current roster of 86 students (48% female; 16% URM,
8% disabled, 15% 1st generation college, and 25% disadvantaged) come from across the nation, from a variety
of educational backgrounds, and with significant prior research experience and publications. Several recent
institutional changes enhance the training environment for CU-MSTP students. Our MSTP students benefit from
an innovative new medical school “Trek” curriculum implemented in 2021 that incorporates novel early
longitudinal integrated clinical training. The resulting new MSTP “Switchback” curriculum connects rigorous
research training with cutting-edge medical training in a highly integrated, flexible, and individualized manner,
maintaining the strengths of the prior CU-MSTP training plan and keeping the ~8-year timeline for completion of
both degrees. For thesis research, our students choose from a wide variety of fields with MSTP faculty in 15
graduate training programs across three campuses (Anschutz Medical Campus, National Jewish Health, and
the University of Colorado-Boulder). Participating CU-MSTP faculty have a combined annual grant income of
~$60M. To enhance the success of our students, we provide career guidance throughout the training period,
and we work diligently to place our graduates in elite residencies and fellowships. Our students have excelled in
metrics that predict career success as physician scientists, including publishing impactful peer-reviewed
manuscripts, obtaining early research funding, and matching in competitive, research-focused residencies. CU
School of Medicine provides strong support to CU-MSTP, with a total of $16.97M total support in the 2017-2021
five-year cycle. The growing Anschutz Medical Campus provides state-of-the-art education, research and clinical
facilities, and enjoys significant momentum with recent major campus initiatives including the new Center for
Health AI, RNA Biosciences Initiative, and Department of Biomedical Informatics. In sum, the continuous
improvement of the Program, enlarging applicant pool, quality of recruited students and training faculty, student
outcomes, institutional support, research funding and environment justifies our request for 21 training slots/year."

10843127,"Abstract Shared Resource Management
The COHCCC Shared Resources play a vital role in support of the cancer-focused research of all five programs
within the CC, spanning the translational pipeline from the earliest phase of discovery to the manufacture of new
biologics, cell therapeutics, and small molecules for preclinical and Phase 1 studies.
Specific Aims for SRM:
Aim 1. Provide centralized SR leadership and oversight to meet the scientific needs of COHCCC
Members.
Aim 2. Implement effective, standardized policies and practices that govern the use and evaluation of
SRs.
Aim 3. Respond to the current and future scientific needs of COHCCC Members via targeted
 enhancements to SR infrastructure, services, and operations.
The Shared Resources management structure oversees all operational aspects including equipment acquisition
and maintenance, billing, staffing, informational seminars, and consistent monitoring of service quality and
operational efficiency. This is accomplished via cooperative interactions between the SR Directors, their
respective Advisory Committees (SRAC), the Shared Resources Steering Committee (SRSC), Shared
Resources Administration (SRA), and the AD for Shared Resources. User feedback is provided from multiple
inputs, through formal and informal mechanisms, and provides the basis for continual surveying of all aspects of
COHCCC SR operations. Changes in service lines, SR leadership, and addition of new SRs are finalized under
the direction of the COHCCC Director and COHCCC EC working in conjunction with the AD, SRSC, and SRM
with the goal of constant improvement. Since the last review, significant changes have included complete
integration of SRs between COH and TGen, enhancement of high throughput screening and digital imaging
services, inclusion of mathematical oncology under biostatistics (BMOC), and significant upgrades in services
and leadership structure for both Integrated Mass Spectrometry (IMS) and Research Pathology (RP). A Clinical
Microbiome (CMB) SR is proposed as a new CCSG resource to enhance collaborative interactions between
COH and TGen CCC faculty, and complement existing SRs in support of the strategic goals of the cancer center.

uniquely positioned to realize breakthrough advances in basic science, clinical trials, and patient care. COHCCC
engages in a 5-year strategic planning process involving many collaborating partners, including COHCCC
faculty, staff, patients, and stakeholders, each providing crucial input and valuable feedback. The approach
includes data collection and analysis, multiple interviews with key parties, and an iterative review and approval
process of the final deliverable. A new plan was launched in October 2021 with an emphasis on 1) Precision
Medicine, 2) Cellular Therapeutics, 3) Health Equity, and 4) Clinical Networks. Performance and progress of the
stated goals within the plan are tracked and catalogued on an ongoing basis."
10886492,"Project Summary
The ability to accurately predict the effect of genetic variation on phenotypes at multiple scales would radically
transform our ability to apply genomic technologies in order to understand human health and disease. This
predictive ability would significantly improve the effectiveness of a broad spectrum of genomic analyses
ranging from genome-wide association studies for common diseases to diagnostic odysseys searching for
genetic causes of rare diseases.
To address this challenge, we propose to develop a trainable approach for predicting the phenotypic impact of
genetic variants. This approach will support predictions for a broad range of genetic variations, phenotypes,
and biological contexts. It will incorporate and exploit mechanistic knowledge of pathways where available, but
augment this pathway knowledge with learned models where it is not. This approach will consist of a synthesis
of (i) methods that link genomic variants to their effect on expression or function of individual gene products, (ii)
methods that link those relationships into the subnetworks involved in cellular responses of interest, (iii)
machine-learning approaches that infer models pertaining to a variety of genotype-phenotype relations from
large training sets.
We will also develop and apply active learning algorithms to identify the most informative experiments for
subsequent analysis by IGVF Consortium. Additionally, we will develop and apply a statistical framework for
elucidating genetic modifiers, through probabilistic, network-informed inference of common variants identified
in GWAS that modify the impact of rare variants implicated in sequencing-based association studies.
Throughout the project, we will work closely with other IGVF Centers to guide experimental data collection,
benchmark methods from across Centers, and contribute to the variant-element-phenotype catalog which will
have broad applications by the community."
10881699,"Immunopathology Core 
Project Summary 
Biomedical researchers are often limited in their ability to perform complex immunopathologic analyses, either 
by a lack of technology/instrumentation available or by inexperience in delineating complex mechanisms 
associated with immune dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. The Immunopathology Core Laboratory (IPC) 
program in the Oklahoma Center of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases (OCRID) bridges this gap and provides 
a comprehensive solution by providing (1) access to cutting-edge assays for immunological data curation, (2) 
tissue processing for histopathology and downstream immunologic assays, and (3) expert support in the 
analyses of immunopathologic data and gross/histologic lesion interpretation. At its core, the IPC functions as a 
critical resource for pilot projects and OCRID investigators by providing flow cytometry, fluorescent-assorted cell 
sorting (FACS), immunofluorescent immunohistochemistry (IFA-IHC), and multiplex immunoassay (MIA) 
analyses. These functions are augmented through integration of our histopathology unit, which provides 
essential support in processing of research tissues for pathologic interpretation and downstream immunologic 
analyses. The primary function of the IPC in Phase III of this will be to provide continued immunology and 
pathology support for COBRE pilot projects and OCRID Center Investigators through implementation of a 
voucher program. The immediate impacts of the IPC in Phase III will be to (1) sustain OCRID pilot projects and 
investigators by facilitating access to immunopathologic services, and (2) continue development of OCRID by 
providing the means to incentivize growth of OCRID programs and projects beyond Phase III. The long-term 
goal of this Phase III project will be to broaden and diversify the IPC to recruit investigators from wider research 
fields from supporting institutions, thereby instituting a long-term solution for researchers in the region. To 
achieve this, the IPC will capitalize on the momentum gained by our fee-for-service program to expand services 
and capabilities to serve a larger group of scientists in the regional research community through (1) outreach 
seminars to increase awareness across the region, (2) soliciting collaborative extramural grant collaborations to 
recruit projects that utilize core services, and (3) acquisition of a user-friendly, high throughput cell analyzer to 
facilitate usage by wider clientele. We have already taken steps to increase usage by OCRID investigators and 
researchers at other institutions and by implementing outreach programs to increase our profile and build intra- 
and extramural clientele within the region, we will expand the IPC into a self-sustaining entity, able to support 
current and long-term state-of-the-art research projects at local and regional institutions."

Project Summary
Molecular biology approaches are utilized to understand the mechanisms underlying respiratory diseases
caused by respiratory pathogens. The overall objective of the Molecular Biology Core (MBC) is to provide
centralized services and technical expertise in molecular biology for Phase III CoBRE and non-CoBRE
investigators. Under the Phase I CoBRE award, the MBC was established to provide services involving
molecular biology technologies, including RNAi gene silencing, transgene expression, mutagenesis, gene and
pathway reporter assays, real-time PCR, and DNA microarray analyses for gene profiling. State-of-the-art
technologies and other services based on the needs of the CoBRE investigators have been continuously
developed and added to the Core since its inception. In Phase II, the MBC was expanded to include new
techniques, including CRISPR/Cas9 technology and bulk RNA sequencing, and to offer reagents for
respiratory and infectious disease research, including cell lines, primary lung cells, and respiratory viruses and
bacteria. This Phase III application describes additional cutting-edge technologies and valuable reagents that
will be offered to Center investigators, including single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial gene profiling, genome-
wide CRISPR screening, human lung tissue models (lung organoids) and clinical samples from respiratory
infectious disease patients. The specific aims of the MBC are to provide services and support for 1) functional
studies using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9, transgene overexpression, mutagenesis and deletion, lentiviral,
adenoviral and nonviral vectors for gene transfer, and stable knockout and transgenic cell lines, 2) genome-
wide gene profiling using bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial gene profiling, 3)
genome-wide CRISPR gene activation, knockout and interference screens, 4) molecular assays including
reporter assays, real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR, 5) reagents for respiratory and infectious disease
research including respiratory viruses and bacteria, and reporter viruses, cell lines, primary lung cells, human
lung organoids and clinical samples from respiratory infectious disease patients, and 6) advice, consultation
and training on various aspects of molecular biology, developing or adapting new methods as needed and
disseminating core resources and technologies."

basic, and population science. In turn, the DF/HCC Prostate SPORE program as a whole will greatly benefit
through interactions with fresh and diverse ideas and talent. Applications for at least two annual CEP awards
will be solicited broadly across DF/HCC and Massachusetts and will undergo a fair and transparent review
process overseen by CEP leadership (Drs. Paul Nguyen, Lorelei Mucci, and Adam Feldman). Targeted
outreach will focus on women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (UREG), who will be actively
encouraged to apply and will be fully supported once funded, both during the CEP funding and beyond. We
have established an Advisory Committee to address inclusion and diversity through recruitment and
retention of UREG and women within the SPORE. To develop the pipeline, an additional annual pre-CEP
award, supported by institutional funds, will be awarded to a graduate student, post-doc, or clinical fellow
from an underrepresented group. Request for Applications will be announced by e-mail and social media,
posted throughout the DF/HCC institutions via message boards and featured on the DF/HCC Prostate
SPORE and Harvard Catalyst websites, and outreach by CEP leaders. The CEP program will help advance
the research careers of faculty by providing funding for independent projects, infrastructure and resources
through the cores, interactions with established prostate cancer investigators through SPORE meetings and
educational sessions, and by establishing a formalized mentorship program. The CEP program will build
upon a strong prior track record of success in enhancing and supporting career development, and is a
critical piece of the overall DF/HCC Prostate SPORE program in our mission to train and develop the next
generation of leaders in prostate cancer translational research."

Implicit Structural Priming as a Treatment Component in Aphasia
 Impaired message-to-structure mapping is at the heart of communication deficits in persons with
aphasia (PWA), resulting in impaired sentence production and comprehension. As of yet, the few
treatment options available for the mapping deficits involve explicit metacognitive training of sentence
production, yielding variable generalization and maintenance effects. Therefore, there remains a critical
need to identify interventions that successfully improve mapping abilities in PWA. This project
introduces implicit structural priming as a novel facilitator for language recovery in aphasia. Structural
priming, a tendency to repeat or better process a current sentence because of its structural similarity to
a previously experienced (“prime”) sentence, has been ubiquitously observed across decades of
psycholinguistic research and viewed as a powerful tool to study the processes of implicit language
learning. Preliminary studies reported in this application suggest that structural priming can be applied
to PWA and might produce positive, enduring language recovery in PWA. The planned studies seek to
test the hypothesis that implicit structural priming alters the central syntactic system in PWA, creating
lasting and generalized improvements in both language production and comprehension. Aim 1 will
determine the extent to which different manipulations of structural priming conditions modulate
immediate and long-term improvement in sentence production. We integrate multiple theories of
language learning and apply them to make predictions about the trajectory of priming-induced syntactic
learning in PWA. In Aim 2, using a set of eyetracking sentence comprehension tasks, we investigate
whether the effects of structural priming in production generalize to off-line (accuracy) and on-line (eye
fixations) sentence comprehension and determine what learning conditions result in greater cross-
modality generalization. In Aim 3, we develop and establish Phase I efficacy data of an implicit
structural priming treatment, incorporating the crucial learning conditions supporting maximal retention
from Aims 1 and 2. The outcomes of this work will lead to identification of a model of language
(re-)learning in aphasia and the development of a novel treatment that capitalizes on the benefits of
the implicit learning mechanisms underlying structural priming."
10837785,"Project Summary/Abstract
Major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States, affecting
approximately 20% of the population at least once in their lifetime. Pharmacologic treatment has been
anchored in monoamine reuptake inhibitors; however up to a third of patients find no benefit from these agents.
Recently, the development of novel rapid-acting antidepressant treatments has provided improvement of
depression symptoms for some patients refractory to traditional pharmacotherapy. Brexanolone, a formulation
of the endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AlloP), is a rapid-acting agent for postpartum depression;
however, undesirable side effects limit the feasibility of its widespread use. It is crucial to identify
neurophysiologic actions underlying the antidepressant effects of rapid acting agents to inform continued
development of safe and effective pharmacotherapies for depression. One proposed mechanism for rapid
acting antidepressants is the disinhibition of neural circuits. Here, we focus on hippocampus as a nexus of
debilitative cognitive symptoms in depression and other neuropsychiatric illness. We will characterize AlloP-
induced changes to neural activity at cellular, circuit, and network levels to identify specific changes to
neurophysiology induced by this rapidly acting antidepressant. We hypothesize that low-dose AlloP
cultivates paradoxical disinhibition that generates distinct in vivo electrophysiological characteristics
of rapid antidepressants.
We will test this hypothesis in a series of experimental aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that AlloP disinhibits
CA1 through cellular and population measures of activity in vitro. We will test whether sub-sedative
concentrations of AlloP disinhibits CA1 pyramidal cells and query the involvement of interneurons in this
phenomenon. Aim 2 will investigate the hypothesis that clinically relevant concentrations of AlloP have
preferential actions onto hippocampal interneurons compared to CA1 pyramidal neurons. We compare direct
actions of AlloP on inhibition of interneurons and pyramidal cells, and probe contributions by GABAAR
subpopulations. Aim 3 will identify features of neural oscillations induced by AlloP in vivo at doses relevant for
antidepressant effects. Mice will be monitored with video EEG and by depth LFP recordings after
administration of drug to probe physiologic markers that differentiate AlloP from comparators and thus may
mark antidepressant potential. The results will provide a better understanding of how neurosteroid drugs affect
different cell and receptor types to ultimately regulate circuit and network activity. The combination of diverse
experimental approaches provides excellent training potential for my scientific training. Coupled with the
outstanding clinical training and mentorship provided by Washington University School of Medicine, this
proposal will help me achieve my career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist."
10815755,"Project Summary/Abstract
The U-RISE program at Cal State Fullerton proposes to support 10 undergraduate students every year who
come from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds. Majoring in a STEM field, the program will prepare
the U-RISE scholars for graduate school and a career in biomedical science. The specific goals are to: 1) recruit,
select, and retain a diverse group of well-qualified undergraduates; 2) provide scholars with hands-on research
experience and develop their research skills; 3) mentor and educate the scholars on the importance of
responsible conduct of research and scientific rigor; 4) cultivate the scholars’ academic and communication skills;
5) prepare, help, and advise the scholars on their application to summer research programs and PhD or MD-
PhD programs; and 6) build a strong mentoring community by recruiting and training a diverse and committed
group of mentors. These goals will be achieved as the scholars participate in cutting-edge research with a faculty
mentor for two years, culminating with a presentation and defense of a written thesis. Upon admission to the
program, the scholars will participate in a summer workshop to teach them about the responsible conduct of
research and scientific rigor and reproducibility. The scholars are expected to excel in several academically
challenging courses, including one semester of scientific writing, one semester of scientific communication, and
two semesters of senior thesis courses. The scholars will also take four semesters of a pro-seminar course,
which focuses on research career and presentation skills development. To measure our short-term progress, we
will use specially developed assessment tools, forms, and e-journal entries previously used by the CSUF MARC
program. The scholars and mentors will complete assessment forms administered by an external evaluator at
the end of each semester on a yearly basis. All U-RISE scholars will be expected to improve or achieve one
level higher (on a scale of 1-5) in laboratory performance, research skills, and communication skills. By the end
of their two-year participation, the scholars would have shown improvement or high achievement in at least 75%
of the measurable objectives. Over the funding period, we aim to place at least 75% of all U-RISE scholars in
high-quality doctoral programs. Finally, the U-RISE program will track all graduates by e-mail or phone as they
progress towards their advanced degrees and beyond, and will disseminate its accomplishments through an
official website, conferences, and publications. Overall, program success will be measured by scholar enrollment
and retention in doctoral programs at various US institutions in the short term, and by their eventual entry into
biomedical research-related careers in the long term. The U-RISE program will not only contribute to the success
of the scholars in their research careers but will have a broader impact on the participating departments, colleges,
and the institution as a whole through improved student success, curricular enhancement, and strengthening of
the undergraduate research environment."

More than one million people have died from accidental drug overdose in the United States (US) in the past
twenty years. In response to this unabating crisis, New York City implemented the first two publicly recognized
overdose prevention centers (OPCs) in the nation in November 2021. Rhode Island became the first state to
authorize OPCs through state legislation and they are expected to open in late 2022. OPCs are community-
based facilities that permit clients to consume pre-obtained controlled substances under the supervision of
personnel who are trained to intervene in the event of an overdose. Staff at OPCs also provide safer drug
consumption education, access to sterile drug use supplies, offer health and ancillary services, and provide
referrals to other treatment, health, and recovery services. While research from other countries and from an
unsanctioned site in the US suggest that OPCs produce individual health and community benefits, no evaluations
exist of sanctioned OPCs in the US. The proposed study has extraordinarily high policy significance, as it will
evaluate the public health, public safety, and community benefits—and potential unintended effects—of the first
sanctioned OPCs in the US. We propose to conduct a rigorous, multi-site, multi-component evaluation of OPCs
in New York City and Rhode Island in 2023-2027. At the individual level, we aim to evaluate whether a
prospective cohort of 500 persons attending OPCs experience lower rates of overdose, other health problems,
and emergency department use, and a higher rate of substance use disorder treatment initiation, compared to a
cohort of 500 persons who do not attend OPCs (Aim 1). At the community level, we will examine whether
neighborhoods surrounding the OPCs experience a greater change in overdose, measures of drug-related public
disorder, and acute economic conditions following the opening of OPCs, compared to neighborhoods unexposed
to OPCs (Aim 2). Third, we aim to delve into the role that the operational context, including neighborhood
location, program models, and operating procedures, plays in shaping the effectiveness of OPCs using
qualitative and ethnographic approaches (Aim 3). Finally, we will estimate additional costs and cost savings to
the healthcare and criminal justice systems associated with OPC use, to support future cost-effectiveness
analyses of OPCs (Aim 4). To accomplish these aims, we have assembled an internationally renowned
investigative team and established strong, community-engaged research partnerships with harm reduction
organizations in New York City and Rhode Island. As more jurisdictions throughout the US consider opening
OPCs, findings from the proposed research will have critical implications for US drug policy. The study’s results
will have powerful, lasting implications for communities that wish to offer OPCs, generate critical data to optimize
their effectiveness, and provide models for sustainability and expansion of these interventions."

Volumetric imaging and computation to characterize cardiac electromechanical coupling
Approximately 450,000 individuals in the United States die suddenly from cardiac arrhythmias every year. Many
widely used medications such as antiarrhythmic agents, antimicrobials, anticancer drugs, and psychotropic drugs
can cause or exacerbate a variety of arrhythmias. However, the fundamental mechanisms of most clinical
arrhythmias remain poorly understood. The ability to prospectively identify potentially arrhythmogenic
compounds would be clinically valuable. Recent advances demonstrate that zebrafish are a productive model
system to screen small molecules that function as arrhythmic compounds in humans. However, much remains
unknown about the involved excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities and mechanisms of arrhythmias
associated with specific drugs. Despite the new zebrafish lines gained in past decades, technical difficulties
including motion artifact, frame rate, penetration depth, and signal-to-noise ratio limits the in-depth investigation
of aberrant calcium activities and contractile dysfunction. For this reason, we seek to integrate our 4-dimensional
(4D, 3D spatial + 1D temporal) volumetric imaging with computational model to investigate whether a common
mechanism of action underlies drug-induced excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities. In collaboration with
Dr. Kelli Carroll (developmental biology), Dr. Catherine Makarewich (calcium signaling), and Dr. Jay Kuo
(machine learning), we will test the hypothesis that small molecule-induced bradycardia activates distinct EC
coupling abnormalities responsible for various arrhythmias. In Aim 1, we will reveal the 4D calcium activities
across the intact heart with high spatiotemporal resolution via our custom-built structured-illumination light-field
microscope. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the electromechanical interaction among neighboring cardiomyocytes
during 5~10 cardiac cycles. In Aim 3, we will assess the excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities induced
by small molecule compounds. In this context, success of this research will establish a new holistic strategy to
in vivo investigate sophisticated electromechanical interaction, providing an entry point to further study the
underlying mechanism of arrhythmias and prospectively identify arrhythmogenic compounds."

The goal of this K08 application is to provide a rigorous 5-year scientific and careered development training plan
that will facilitate Dr. Josephine Thinwa to transition from a post-doctoral fellow to an independent investigator.
The candidate completed her MD/PhD degree at UT Health San Antonio where she focused on innate immunity.
After completing internal medicine and infectious diseases training at UT Southwestern, she joined the lab of Dr.
Beth Levine, a renowned expert in autophagy, to pursue a project on the interface between autophagy and
antiviral immunity. Autophagy is known to function in antiviral innate immunity by specifically targeting
intracellular viral components for lysosomal degradation, a process called virophagy. However, how virophagy
is activated and regulated is still poorly understood. Based on an unbiased screen for host genes necessary for
autophagy induction during infection with two prototypic neurotropic viruses, Sindbis virus (SINV) and Herpes
Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), her preliminary work identified CDKL5 as a candidate novel regulator of virophagy.
She demonstrated that cells deficient in CDKL5 accumulated high levels of SINV capsid protein. Additionally,
she determined that CDKL5KO mice were more susceptible to lethal CNS infections with SINV and HSV-1,
suggesting that CDKL5 is a critical host antiviral factor. After learning of her mentor’s likely terminal illness, Dr.
Thinwa worked with Dr. Levine to establish a mentoring team of accomplished scientists who would provide the
expertise and training necessary for her to successfully elucidate the function of CDKL5 in antiviral immunity and
become an independent investigator. Her mentorship transitioned smoothly after Dr. Levine passed away to Dr.
Michael Shiloh, her primary co-mentor who is a physician scientist and expert in innate immunity and autophagy,
and Dr. Julie Pfeiffer, a renowned scientist in viral pathogenesis. They have successfully trained numerous
postdoctoral fellows to achieve scientific independence. This mentoring team is perfectly complemented for the
proposed studies at the interface between autophagy and antiviral immunity by her outside co-mentor Dr. Hebert
“Skip” Virgin. He is a physician scientist and an undisputed leader in the field of autophagy and innate antiviral
immunity. He also has a very strong track record of mentoring postdoctoral trainees. A committee of advisors
and collaborators consisting of three outstanding scientists will provide additional scientific expertise to enhance
her technical skills and offer guidance in scientific and career matters. In her proposed research, the applicant
will aim to 1) define the function of CDKL5 in virophagy, 2) delineate which step(s) of the SINV life cycle are
modulated by CDKL5, and 3) determine the role of CDKL5 in host antiviral response in vivo. Overall, the
proposed studies are likely to expand our understanding of how host cells mitigate the toxic overproduction of
viral proteins during infection. Together with access to excellent institutional resources, and training from didactic
courses on leadership, grantsmanship and technical skills, she is positioned to become a successful physician-
scientist focused on antiviral innate immunity."
10863881,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Influenza virus is a significant pathogen in pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. However, these
individuals respond poorly to standard-dose (SD) inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Recent studies have
investigated two strategies to overcome poor immune responses in SOT recipients: (1) administration of high-
dose (HD)-IIV compared to SD-IIV and (2) two doses of SD-IIV compared to one dose of SD-IIV in the same
influenza season. One study compared HD-IIV vs. SD-IIV in adult SOT recipients and noted that HD-IIV was
safe and more immunogenic; however, the median post-transplant period was 38 months. A phase I pediatric
study comparing a single dose of HD-IIV vs. SD-IIV was safe with higher immunogenicity, but the study was
limited by small sample size and median post-transplant vaccine administration was 26 months. In another
phase II trial of adult SOT recipients, two doses of SD-IIV one month apart compared to one-dose of SD-IIV
revealed modestly increased immunogenicity when given at a median of 18 months post-transplant. Therefore,
these studies lack both evaluation in the early post-transplant period and substantive pediatric populations.
Additionally, the administration of two-doses of HD-IIV in the same influenza season has not been evaluated in
pediatric SOT recipients. Thus, the optimal immunization strategy for pediatric SOT recipients less than 24
months post-transplant is unknown. In addition, immunologic predictors and correlates of influenza vaccine
immunogenicity in pediatric SOT recipients have not been well-defined. The central hypothesis of our
proposal is that pediatric SOT recipients 1-23 months post-transplant who receive two doses of HD-
quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) will have similar safety but higher HAI geometric mean
titers (GMTs) to influenza antigens compared to pediatric SOT recipients receiving two doses of SD-
QIV. To test this hypothesis and address the critical knowledge gaps outlined above, we propose to conduct a
phase II, multi-center, randomized-controlled immunogenicity and safety trial comparing two doses of HD-QIV
to two doses of SD-QIV in pediatric kidney, heart, and/or liver SOT recipients 1-23 months post-transplant. The
results of this study will address significant knowledge gaps regarding influenza vaccine strategies and
immune responses in pediatric SOT recipients and will guide vaccine recommendations in the early post-
transplant period."

This K99/R00 proposal describes a five-year mentored research and training plan that will facilitate the transition
of Dr. Patricia Davenport to an independent academic researcher in neonatal hematology. Dr. Davenport is a
productive and dedicated young physician-scientist working in a clinically relevant and understudied field. PLTs
are active participants in both hemostasis and inflammation, yet clinical awareness of these dual roles has lagged
behind research discoveries, particularly in neonatology. Preterm infants are at high risk of spontaneous bleeding
(particularly intracranial) and thus are typically transfused at higher PLT counts than children or adults, in the
hope of preventing bleeding. However, a recent large randomized trial in preterm neonates found that liberal
PLT transfusions increased mortality and risk of chronic lung disease, without decreasing bleeding. The
mechanisms mediating these findings are unknown, but we hypothesize that they are at least partly related to
the developmental differences between neonatal and adult PLTs. The overarching aim of this proposal is to
improve the management of neonatal thrombocytopenia through a better understanding of the consequences of
PLT transfusions in neonates with various underlying pathologies. Our overall hypothesis is that the effects of
PLT transfusions increasing neonatal mortality and severity of chronic lung disease are mediated by an
amplification of the neonatal inflammatory responses. To test this hypothesis, we designed the following Specific
Aims: 1. Determine the effects of PLT transfusions on newborn mice with and without endotoxemia; 2. Determine
the effects of PLT transfusions on mortality in a neonatal model of sepsis; and 3. Characterize the effects of PLT
transfusions in a neonatal murine model of chronic lung disease. This research is highly significant, as knowledge
gained from it will inform clinical practice and research. Dr. Davenport will receive mentorship from her co-
mentors, Dr. Martha Sola-Visner, an NIH-funded researcher in the field of neonatal PLT biology, and Dr. Stella
Kourembanas, a world-renowned investigator in neonatal pulmonary physiology and chronic lung disease. In
addition, Dr. Davenport will have the guidance of her Scientific Advisory Committee, composed of distinguished
scientists with expertise in transfusion medicine and immunology, neonatal sepsis and inflammation, infectious
diseases, and study design/statistics. The training opportunities and resources at Boston Children’s Hospital
(BCH) and Harvard Medical School provide an ideal environment for the candidate’s career development. The
Division of Newborn Medicine at BCH is committed to Dr. Davenport’s success and has assured at least 75%
protected time to devote to the activities described in this proposal. A detailed career development and training
plan is presented, including mentored research, didactic coursework, seminars and presentations at scientific
meetings, and a plan for manuscript writing and R00 submission. The expertise and knowledge gained from this
Award will enable Dr. Davenport to obtain future R01 funding and transition to an independent research career
focusing on neonatal PLT biology, and particularly the interactions of PLTs with the neonatal lung."

Perception does not depend on environment alone, but also on brain state. Work from our lab and others show
that visual responses to certain features are selectively gated depending on an animal's arousal state. What
are the circuit and synaptic bases for these state-dependent shifts in visual sensitivity? State-
dependent modulation of sensory responses has been well-described in visual cortex. Studies have also
identified behavioral modulation of responses neurons in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the visual
thalamus (dLGN) of mice and primates. Remarkably, in vitro studies from the Chen lab, employing calcium
imaging and patch-clamp recordings, suggest substantial capacity for modulation of visual transmission even
earlier in the visual pathway, at the level of retinal axonal inputs to thalamus. Recently, the Andermann lab
developed methods for imaging thousands of retinal axonal boutons in thalamus of awake mice (Liang et al.,
Cell, 2018). We found that visual responses in retinothalamic boutons can be profoundly suppressed during
arousal, in a manner dependent on the boutons' visual feature preferences for stimulus location, size, motion
direction, and for luminance decreases/increases (Liang et al., Current Biology, in press). These results are
strikingly similar to the Chen lab's earlier in vitro findings of suppression of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axonal
boutons by serotonin (5-HT). Notably, the Chen lab showed that the actions of 5-HT on RGC axons are likely
mediated by the presynaptic 5-HT1B receptor (5-HT1BR), a key receptor mediating serotonin's actions on
axon terminals throughout the brain. Preliminary data suggest that the 5-HT1BR is more strongly expressed in
axons of genetically defined RGCs with larger receptive fields. Further, our preliminary in vivo studies show
that dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons (i) are sensitive to behavioral state, (ii) send a dense and focal
projection to the dLGN, and (iii) suppress visual responses in a similar subset of RGC axons that is
suppressed by arousal. Based on these findings, the Chen and Andermann labs propose to test the hypothesis
that serotonergic inputs to the dLGN differentially suppress specific visual information in an arousal state-
dependent manner. In Aim 1, we will ask whether activity of serotonergic inputs in dLGN contribute to arousal
modulation of visual responses in RGC axons. In Aim 2, we will ask whether serotonergic inputs to dLGN
selectively gate specific channels of visual information. Finally, in Aim 3, we will ask whether serotonergic
inputs to dLGN can rapidly modify the gain and/or visual tuning of dLGN neurons. Selective suppression of
transmission at the level of retinal axons offers an efficient strategy to block non-salient retinal signals before
they are amplified by thalamocortical loops. The bridging of expertise between the Chen and Andermann labs
will establish a unified framework for understanding selective sensory processing across behavioral states at a
surprisingly early and tractable stage of visual processing. Our studies suggest that neuromodulation of retinal
axons should be considered when developing strategies for restoring vision following optic nerve damage."
10852819,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dopamine signaling in the striatum is critical for movement, yet the mechanistic basis for its permissive role in
motor actions is incompletely understood. The longstanding view is that dopamine promotes movement by
differentially modulating the striatum’s principal neurons, the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor expressing spiny
projection neurons (SPNs). Specifically, striatal dopamine is thought to increase D1- and decrease D2-SPN
excitability. This view has strong support from 1) ex vivo measurements of dopamine’s effects on D1- and D2-
SPN excitability and the in vivo observations that 2) ablating dopamine neurons decreases D1- and increases
D2-SPN activity and 3) the selective activation of D1- or D2-SPNs respectively promotes or suppresses
movement. However, several recent findings from in vivo recordings of D1- and D2-SPN activity do not support
a simple “go/no-go” model for D1- and D2-SPN function in movement. Specifically, in vivo recordings have shown
that D1- and D2-SPNs co-activate in spatially overlapped clusters, both increase their activity at higher running
speeds, and both decrease their activity at motion offset. Therefore, it remains unclear precisely which aspects
of D1- and D2 activity (e.g., levels, timing, or spatial coordination) are modulated by dopamine signaling and how
this promotes movement. To address these questions, we have developed three, multiphoton imaging
approaches to simultaneously record 1) D1- and D2-SPN activity, 2) dopamine axon activity and D1- or D2-SPN
activity, and 3) immediate early gene expression tagging and D1- or D2-SPN activity in vivo. We will use these
tools to image neural activity during training in a dopamine-dependent, conditioned-avoidance motor learning
task. Our preliminary data indicate that dopamine is released during learned movement in this task, and that D1-
and D2-SPNs encode these movements with different levels, timing, and spatial coordination. We hypothesize
that these changes are necessary for motor learning and result from dopamine’s gradual and differential effects
on the strength of excitatory synaptic connections in specific subsets of D1- and D2-SPNs. We will test this
hypothesis by integrating the results from our in vivo imaging experiments with ex vivo measurements of synaptic
strength in D1- and D2-SPNs. Overall, our experiments have the potential to resolve a central conflict in our
understanding of dopamine’s role in motor control and how this process goes awry in neurological and psychiatric
disease."
10814262,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over 40% of lung allograft recipients succumb within five years of being transplanted, making it clear that there is an
urgent unmet need to address the inadequacies of chronic immunosuppression (IS) in these patients. Achieving a
robust state of tolerance in lung recipients would reduce or eliminate the major lung-specific and drug-related factors
that contribute to this dismal statistic. Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in nonhuman primates (NHPs)
and humans by using a combination of nonmyeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation that
results in transient mixed hematopoietic chimerism. However, identical protocols have failed to induce tolerance in
recipients of lung allografts. Despite the resistance of lung allografts to tolerance induction, we have now shown for
the first time, that achieving a state of durable (for the life of the organ) mixed chimerism in NHP recipients results in
long-term, IS-free survival of lung allografts. This remarkable result was achieved by modifying the mixed chimerism
conditioning to augment host regulatory mechanisms. While a significant advance, this modified mixed chimerism
protocol was only successful in recipients of MHC haplo-matched lung allografts and was associated with significant
toxicity in the form of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and
radiation-induced myelosuppression. Our goal now is to render this breakthrough clinically applicable by generating a
safer and more effective protocol that is capable of inducing long-term tolerance of unrelated, fully MHC mismatched
lung allografts using FDA-approved or soon-to-be-approved drugs. This Program’s unifying hypothesis is that inducing
durable chimerism and long-term tolerance in recipients of stringent lung allografts will require next-generation mixed
chimerism protocols that augment systemic and intra-graft adaptive and innate regulatory mechanisms. In Project 1,
we will 1) use intra-organ delivery of αIL-6R-specific nanoparticles to reduce the risk of acute rejection and IS-related
complications immediately following lung transplantation, 2) use mTORi-specific nanotherapies to achieve durable
chimerism and tolerance of lung allografts transplanted across a full MHC barrier by reducing trained immunity and
promoting regulatory mechanisms, and 3) incorporate Bcl-2 inhibition to promote durable mixed chimerism while
diminishing the toxicities related to αCD8 mAb treatment and total body irradiation (TBI). These studies will be
complemented by Project 2, which will test our unifying hypothesis using novel strategies for antibody-based
conditioning, regulatory T cells (Treg)-supportive immunomodulation, and gene-modified Tregs, all poised for
immediate clinical translation. State-of-the-art mechanistic assays coordinated by Core A (The Molecular Immunology
Core, ‘MIC’) will enable rapid cross-fertilization of insights gained in each project. We anticipate that together, these
highly interactive projects will generate one or more safe and effective durable mixed chimerism tolerance protocols
ready for clinical trials by the end of the funding period. If successful, these studies could impact the entire field of
transplantation and provide insights that could also be field-changing for bone marrow transplantation and autoimmune
disease."

One in six children in the U.S. and Canada have one or more learning or behavioral problems, such as
learning disability, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, depression, or attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early brain development is sensitive to toxicant exposures, including heavy
metals, persistent organic pollutants, and endocrine disrupting chemicals. Exposure to mixtures of
environmental chemicals is a reality in children, and chemical mixtures may have different modes of action
affecting neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiations, synaptic formation/trimming/plasticity, myelination,
and neurotransmitters, resulting in adverse impact on the central nervous system. Majority of environmental
epidemiologic studies have only examined the impact of a single chemical on neurobehavioral outcomes.
Recent development and application of mixture statistical methods will provide great potential to reveal the
impact of an individual chemical, interactions between chemicals, and cumulative exposure. These methods
have only been applied in limited studies of child neurobehavior and none has been used for neuroimaging
outcomes. We will use two existing birth cohorts to examine the impact of both pre- and postnatal exposures to
chemical mixtures on child neurobehavior. The Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME)
Study is a Cincinnati-based birth cohort of 400 pregnant women with children followed up to age 12 years, and
the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) is a Canadian study of 1983 pregnant
women with children followed up to age 9-11 years. The two North American birth cohorts both measured over
60 environmental contaminants, including lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, polybrominated diphenyl ethers,
polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides,
bisphenol A, phthalates, triclosan, and organophosphate flame retardants, as well as child cognitive abilities
(n>1000), behavior (n>1000), and neuroimaging (n=390). We will utilize advanced statistical methods for
chemical mixtures, including Elastic Net (ENET) for variable selection, Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS)
regression for individual chemical effect estimation, and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) for
interactions, nonlinearities, and joint effects. This project will be among the first to test and quantify the
potential impact of prenatal and postnatal exposures to chemical mixtures on neurobehavioral and
neuroimaging outcomes in well-established cohorts. The results have the potential to greatly increase our
understanding of developmental neurotoxicity of chemical mixtures in children and affect environmental health
policy making."

 This is an application for a K01 Award for Dr. James Harrison, an Assistant Professor at the University
of California San Francisco. Dr. Harrison’s career goal is to become an independent researcher in aging who
uses patient engagement and implementation science to improve the outcomes of older adults transitioning
from the hospital to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Dr. Harrison’s aspiration is for health systems to place
older adults at the center of innovation discovery and care redesign. This K01 Award will help make this
aspiration a reality by providing him with the training and research experience needed to develop and
implement care transition interventions that are patient-centered and sustained in real-world settings. To
facilitate successful completion of these activities, Dr. Harrison has assembled a strong mentorship team. His
primary mentor is Dr. Margaret Fang, a clinical outcomes researcher who focuses on medications for
vulnerable older adults. His co-mentors are Dr Rebecca Sudore, an expert in developing and testing tools to
facilitate health communication for diverse older adults; Dr. Audrey Lyndon, an expert in qualitative research
methods focusing on communication and teamwork; Dr Andrew Auerbach, an expert implementation scientist.
 Older adults comprise 75% of all hospital discharges to SNFs each year. Transition care planning
remains persistently medicalized, failing to be guided by patients’ own preferences for their recovery, and does
not incorporate elements that support preferences related to independence, returning home and function, or
factors that allow participation in family or community activities that provide a foundation for personal purpose.

transition planning is needed. In Aim 1, Dr. Harrison will conduct a qualitative grounded theory study to explore
how patients and caregivers anticipate and are prepared for a SNF discharge. This study will also examine
care team behaviors and processes that impact on how preferences are incorporated into transition plans. Aim
2 will involve co-developing a SNF preparation tool (SNF-PT) and associated implementation strategy with
stakeholders using human centered design techniques. The objective of the SNF-PT will be to facilitate
communication and implementation of patient preferences into SNF transition plans. In Aim 3, the SNF-PT will
be piloted focusing on implementation outcomes and preliminary impacts on patient outcomes. This data will
inform future R01 type-applications evaluating the SNF-PT.
 Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, Dr. Harrison will gain skills in 1) Core
principles of geriatrics, 2) The theory and application of advanced qualitative research methods (e.g. grounded
theory), 3) User-centered design techniques to intervention development for older adults, and 4) Research
leadership development. This K01 Award will provide Dr. Harrison with the expertise and data to launch his
career as an independent investigator in aging focused on the hospital to SNF care transition."

Opioid addiction is a chronic, progressive disorder that fuels the current US epidemic of opioid overdose deaths.
Over the years, a tremendous amount of research effort has been devoted to understanding the biological roles
of opioid receptors and developing newer generations of synthetic opioids to treat pain and combat opioid
addiction. However, given the advancement of contemporary and novel neuroscience technologies, we have the
tools to think beyond mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to develop improved OUD therapeutics. This proposal aims
to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing neural circuits in the brain and to
determine how these circuits maintain cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across
different stages of the OUD cycle. In four complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and
functional connectivity of opioidergic networks using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify
monosynaptic inputs to withdrawal-active MOR-expressing cells and axonal output projections, as a function of
opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then integrate these input/output maps with cell-type information and
gene expression changes within dependence networks using hyper-multiplexed 3D in situ hybridizations to
generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell types and retro-
labeled connections. Finally, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within core regions are modulated during
opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted microscopes to image the population activity—
at cellular resolution—across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. Our models will provide formal
summaries of activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve with repetitive opioid exposure and
withdrawal, and our datasets will be made publicly available as they are generated. To bridge these experimental
measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network Control Theory to
identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify potential candidates
that disproportionately drive each state."
10840373,"Project Summary/Abstract
We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by virtue of
activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that cause us to eat
more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more interesting: a taste hits the
tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing food-related information back and forth as
the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this
process by recording from multiple parts of the taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes.
We have observed this decision-making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report,
in turn, that a taste is on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the
taste; this last step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in
the rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves and
requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do rigorous tests of
where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles played by amygdala and
hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole,
this research project has the potential to completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in
new thinking about perception in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given
the complexity of brain circuitry."
10622153,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Effective clinical and translational research (CTR) requires teams of scientists who can move out of traditional
siloes to engage in research across the translational ecosystem. Competencies in a discipline known as
clinical and translational science (CTS) that includes an array of fundamental characteristics has been
proposed by Gilliland and others, which extends beyond traditional CTR characteristics to feature boundary
crossing, process innovation, and systems thinking in its repertoire. Notably, CTR training programs have
addressed these features in a relatively limited fashion to date that has contributed to the inability of CTR
scientists to nimbly adapt to uncertainty and innovation in the research environment. Therefore, for our CTSA
K12 Program integrated into Workforce Development of our Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences
Institute, we have incorporated Gilliland’s fundamental CTS characteristics into our K12 program objectives.
We request support for six K12 junior faculty scholar positions; appointments will be of at least two
years, but no more than three years’ duration. Our K12 program will support development of scholar self-
efficacy using guidance from K12 faculty mentor dyads, and support from K12 program directors. Scholars will
gain key knowledge, skills, and abilities in an integrated neighborhood of opportunities in CCTSI programs
(funded in our UM1 application) and at academic Partnering Institutions. Our K12 program features six
objectives to ensure scholars’ academic skills development and enlargement of their information and
mentoring network: (1) execution of an independent career development plan based on Gilliland’s fundamental
characteristics to provide core CTS knowledge, personalized to the scholar’s research interests and
experience, (2) receipt of evidence-informed mentoring training in collaboration with faculty mentors, (3)
professional/managerial education, and team leadership training, (4) advanced experiences in academic
writing, including dissemination and communication strategies to enhance impact of research, (5) building
relationships with key stakeholders and members across the scientific ecosystem, and (6) connection to
innovative CTS programs to push existing knowledge boundaries and augment the collaborative network.
Planned short- and long-term evaluations and continuous quality improvement of the program will guide efforts
and address evolving demands. Importantly, one additional objective for our K12 program will ensure
equitable recruitment processes and enhanced training of individuals traditionally underrepresented in
biomedical training programs. Our K12 Program contrasts with other programs at our institution given its
heterogeneous, disease agnostic approach, with focus on the training efficient translational scientists who can
surmount barriers inevitably present in research itself, and in one’s career. The program will support scholars’
growth to become recognized leaders of diverse research teams with independent extramural funding who can
innovate across the translational ecosystem as collaborative clinical translational scientists."
10836443,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this Bioengineering Research project, we propose to develop a novel technique for frequency-domain near-
infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) that aims to achieve selective sensitivity to deeper tissue in non-invasive
diffuse optical spectroscopy and imaging. A technique that features a stronger sensitivity to deeper tissue
relative to superficial tissue can have a broad impact on non-invasive optical diagnostics and monitoring and is
especially important in cerebral oximetry and functional brain imaging. The proposed technique is based on the
new concept of phase dual-slopes (this is the phase of the modulated optical signal measured in FD-NIRS),
which requires a minimum of two light sources and two optical detectors placed on the tissue according to a
special arrangement. In addition to achieving selective sensitivity to deeper tissue, phase dual slopes are
weakly sensitive to instrumental drifts and motion artifacts (except spikes), which is a highly desirable property
for robust measurements. First, we will use diffusion theory and Monte Carlo simulations to identify
source/detector geometrical arrangements and intensity modulation frequencies that optimize performance of
the phase dual-slope for a variety of heterogeneous layered media. Second, we will implement optimal phase
dual-slope conditions with a commercial FD-NIRS instrument to demonstrate effectiveness on tissue-like
phantoms, and we will design special source-detector arrays for imaging based on the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix for phase dual-slope measurements. Third, we will design and build a
dedicated compact, wearable, fiber-less, and cost-effective FD-NIRS device for further broadening the
applicability of the phase dual-slope method to freely moving subjects in everyday conditions, and for point-of-
care applications. Fourth, we will perform human studies for technical performance tests (in skeletal muscle
during vascular occlusions) and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the phase dual-slope method for functional
brain imaging (in the prefrontal cortex during cognitive activation). In particular, the latter study will elucidate
the relative blood flow/blood volume contributions to cortical hemodynamics and will allow for dual-task
measurements in subjects performing cognitive tasks while walking. The broad objective of this project is to
advance the field of diffuse optical measurements of biological tissue by developing special techniques for
collection and analysis of FD-NIRS data to enhance the quality, reliability, and information content of non-
invasive NIRS in research and clinical applications."
10821396,"ABSTRACT
While advances in nucleic acid sequencing to achieve parallel and single molecule analysis have been
astounding, analogous techniques for peptide/protein sequencing are lacking. Tandem mass-spec analysis still
requires millions of copies of a protein and is inherently serial rather than parallel. Thus, the current approaches
being applied to parallel and single molecule protein analysis primarily focus on the use of modified nanopores.
But their ability to differentiate subtle differences between individual amino acids (AAs), or strings of AAs, only
works in isolated cases. To create a parallel single molecule sequencing platform for peptides/proteins, in
collaboration with the Marcotte group, we devised a technique called fluorosequencing. In this technique, we
label AAs with fluorophores, and on a TIRF 4-channel microscope the N-terminal AAs are removed using classic
Edman degradation. As fluorophore labelled AAs are iteratively removed, both their identity and position are
revealed, generating a partial-sequence. The partial-sequences are compared to a genomic database of all
possible proteins, thereby revealing the proteins in the sample. Mixtures of millions of peptides are analyzed in
parallel; single molecules at a time. Albeit the method is functional, there are several aspects that require
improvement to generate a mature technology. One obstacle that we will overcome is the general lack of
approaches that allow sequential and selectively labelling of multiple amino acids on the same peptide/protein
with different tags, as well as differentiating the N-terminal and C-terminal residues from lysine and Glu/Asp AAs,
respectively. We will also explore labeling four AA within the following set: Cys, Lys, Tyr, Typ, His, Ser, Thr,
Glu/Asp, Arg, PSer, PThr, PTyr (P = phospho). Moreover, we feel that fluorosequencing can be readily extended
to post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as mono, di, and trimethylated Lys, as well as ubiquitination. The
sequential and selective labelling of four AAs and/or PTMs will involve conjugation handles carrying “click”
partners within a set of what we refer to as “click:clack” pairs, wherein the “clack” partner will carry one of a set
of four fluorophores appropriate for the four channels of our TIRF microscope. In some previous sequencing
runs we have discovered efficient donor/acceptor FRET between the fluorophores, thereby making the donor
intensity either weak or entirely invisible. To solve this problem, we will explore the use of designed fluorophores
whose emission can be turned on and off by intramolecular conjugate additions which are controlled by varying
the pH. In addition, because a series of common fluorophores, such as Cy and BODIPY dyes, do not survive the
TFA treatment used in Edman degradation, we are developing a base-induced method for N-terminal chain-end
sequencing. Importantly, while each thrust is focused upon use in fluorosequencing, the advances thereof are
broadly applicable to other proteomic approaches (mass spec and nanopore), imaging methods, as well as the
general chemical manipulations of peptides and proteins."
10911791,"Abstract: How the endocytic network mediates specificity of cell signaling
Receptor crosstalk – the cooperation between two or more receptors to modulate cell responses – is a key
signaling mechanism. It enables cells to generate a large combinatorial repertoire of specific signaling with a
limited variety of receptors. Receptor crosstalk plays an essential role in cell physiology. Consequently,
dysfunctions in receptor crosstalk are associated with many human diseases, such as infectious diseases
(including COVID-19), cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. To understand the physical mechanisms by which
signals from different receptors are integrated in crosstalk, studies have exclusively focused on receptor
interactions at the plasma membrane. In contrast, how the crosstalk signals are transduced with high fidelity
from the plasma membrane to the nucleus is poorly understood and scarcely explored.
The overall goal of this research is to establish the functional role of the endocytic network in transducing and
regulating receptor crosstalk. Under the prior ESI-R35 support, our group has made pioneering discoveries
in support of the central hypothesis that the endocytic network is where extracellular chemical and
physical stimuli intertwine to regulate receptor crosstalk. Specifically, we reported a new model in which
receptors can crosstalk by forming overlapping interfaces between discrete signaling clusters, challenging the
prevailing view that receptors oligomerize to crosstalk. Importantly, such spatially organized interaction between
receptors at endosomes and plasma membranes is modulated by extracellular physical cues, and directly
regulates cell inflammatory responses. These prior discoveries and the plethora of new approaches we
developed for studying endosome functions laid a critical and unique foundation for us to address the
knowledge gap: how does the endocytic network mediate receptor crosstalk? We will address how the
endocytic network orchestrates chemical cues from receptor crosstalk (Direction 1), and transduces
extracellular physical cues to refine the specificity of crosstalk signaling (Direction 2). To address the first
direction, we will define the physical mechanisms by which endocytic sorting, collective endosome-organelle
interactions, and endosome-specific activation modulate crosstalk signaling originated from the plasma
membrane. To address the second direction, we will integrate experiments with computational modeling to
determine the feedback loop between the endocytic network and cell-matrix interactions that regulate receptor
crosstalk. This project will establish a mechanistic and predictive understanding of how the endocytic network
mediates the spatiotemporal specificity of receptor crosstalk and cell signaling in general; a topic that is poorly
understood. It will also lower the technical barrier that has impeded research on this topic, by establishing novel
quantitative toolsets for dissecting the dynamics and function of the endocytic network on multiple length scales.
Ultimately, a better understanding of endosome functions in receptor crosstalk will facilitate the development of
new therapeutic strategies for diseases, such as immune adjuvants for cancer therapies and vaccines."
10899446,"Summary – Administrative Core
This NIDA supported Center of Excellence aims to stimulate the University of Arizona’s research on the
neurobiology of addiction and relapse. The Center of Excellence in Addiction Studies (CEAS) consists of
three Research Cores (Genetic Targeting, Neuroanalytical, and Behavioral), a Pilot Research Project (PRP),
and the Administrative Core (AC). The AC functions as the focal point for coordination and implementation of
the activities of the Cores and PRP, providing financial and regulatory oversight, a data repository, and
community information sharing. The main goals of the AC are to operate the CEAS seamlessly promoting
maximal synergy and impact between the Cores and PRP for the research of the users that will lead to new
proposals for addiction research. The AC oversees all activities of the Center and coordinates the
interdisciplinary, multi-PI and multi-core interactions along with providing administrative support. The
functions of the AC fall into four main categories: (1) coordinate meetings, invited lectures, consulting, retreat,
internship program, travels; (2) coordinate requests from users for experiments; (3) establish a database for
experimental data and data sharing; and (4) prepare yearly progress reports, and provide financial and
regulatory oversight. The AC provides a formal and centralized mechanism to accomplish these functions
that will ensure that the activities of the Cores and PRP are carried out efficiently, as well as insuring that the
benefits of the information that result from these activities are shared within the Center and with the scientific
community in compliance with local and federal regulations. The coordination of all of these activities is what
the AC will do to enable success."
10899455,"Summary – Neuroanalytial Core
The Neuroanalytical Core develops and applies methods to measure electroactive neurotransmitters in vivo.
The core will develop and then use electrochemical methods to measure the absolute concentrations of easily
oxidized neurotransmitters in vivo – something not possible with other methodology. Fast changes in the
extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters can arise from phasic neuronal firing. For this reason, chemical
sensors should be able to operate on a wide range of time scales. An ideal sensor for the detection of
neurotransmitters has high sensitivity, can distinguish between compounds, and has a fast response time.
Electrochemical approaches offer a way to accomplish this for easily oxidized neurotransmitters by using an
electrode next to sites where the neurotransmitter is released. The core can monitor rapid, phasic changes using
FSCV or slow, tonic changes using FSCAV. Making simultaneous measurements of dopamine and serotonin
on multiple timescales has the potential to further understanding of the interactions between the two systems. It
is important to note that in vivo experimentation will require informed selection of the brain regions of interest.
This instrument allows for the investigation of the interdependence of the dopaminergic and serotonergic
systems and the role they play in learning and disease states. Excitingly, this core has been designed to allow
additional methods to be incorporated. This core can be used to further behavioral neuroscience and our current
understanding of the links between neurochemical systems. We couple the methodologies to neuroscience to
ensure that we will continue to advance the impact of the NIDA research community."
10817036,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vertebral fracture is the most common type of osteoporotic fracture. Spine is also the most common site of
bone metastasis, leading to pathologic vertebral fractures. While performing activities of daily living is an
essential part of healthy aging, pathologic and non-pathologic vertebral fractures can occur during these
activities in metastatic or osteoporotic spines. These fractures cause pain and neurologic manifestations,
affecting quality of life. Currently, there is no objective clinical technique that can assess bone fracture risks
associated with physical activities. To fill the gap, we propose a patient-specific computational technique to
quantitatively evaluate spine injury risks associated with physical activities. This novel approach will enable
clinicians to reliably recommend safe and individualized activities to elderly populations. To achieve this, we
will obtain motions and muscle activity outcomes from an elderly patient cohort using video motion analysis.
These data will be used as input for kinematic motion analyses and mechanical testing on cadaveric lumbar
spines, to create and validate our computational models. The rationale for this project is that a QCT/FEA
process that can mimic physical activities will be able to reduce vertebral fractures and improve quality of life in
elderly patient populations. Our long-term goal is to develop reliable computational techniques to enable earlier
injury risk predictions in elderly patients with musculoskeletal diseases. Our overall objective, in this
application, is to develop a patient-specific quantitative computed tomography-based finite element analysis
(QCT/FEA) method that can assess both kinematic motions and fracture characteristics of the spine, to
estimate fracture risks of physical activities. To achieve the overall objective, the following three independent
specific aims will be accomplished: 1) to obtain lumbar range of motion and muscle response outcomes in an
elderly patient population during five physical movements; 2) to perform kinematic testing on cadaveric spines
to measure intradiscal pressures –using a novel approach– during physical movements; and also mechanical
testing on spine segments to measure intradiscal pressure at fracture; and 3) to develop and validate
QCT/FEA models of the lumbar spine to estimate spine injury risks.
This research will lead to the development
of a computational tool that can assign a risk score associated with physical activities.
 Further, this work will
provide preliminary data for future R01 grant proposals to predict fracture risks associated with physical
movements and exercises in patient populations."
10806171,"Abstract
 Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of KS, primary effusion lymphoma
(PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). These tumors occur most commonly in individuals with
AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions. Currently, there are no specific therapies for these diseases.
KS is the leading AIDS malignancy, and is epidemic throughout sub Saharan Africa. KS commonly involves the
oral cavity and can widely disseminate to visceral organs. Saliva is the vehicle of transmission for KSHV.
 Following infection, epigenetic modifications associated with transcriptional activation are deposited on
the KSHV genome, leading to widespread, but brief, viral gene expression. Failure to inhibit this expression
leads to lytic replication. Repressive H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 modifications subsequently accumulate to
silence lytic gene promoters. H2AK119ub accrues initially, followed by H3K27me3, in contrast to the classical
model in which H3K27me3 marks precede H2AK119ub.
 Latency is the hallmark of KSHV and gammaherpesvirus infection. KSHV latently infects cells, including
tumor cells, and viral genomes persist as circular, extrachromosomal, multi-copy, episomes. To persist in
proliferating cells, viral episomes must replicate, and subsequently, segregate to daughter nuclei. Tumor cell
viability is dependent on latent KSHV infection.
 The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is one of a limited number of virus genes expressed in
latency. LANA is responsible for KSHV episome maintenance and is necessary and sufficient for virus episome
persistence in the absence of other viral genes. In addition to episome persistence, LANA exerts important
roles in transcriptional regulation and growth control. LANA is involved in silencing the viral genome.
 We have discovered LANA interacts with a component of the DNA damage response (DDR), and that
the DDR silences the viral genome following infection, thereby inhibiting lytic replication and allowing latency
establishment. This work will use rigorous, detailed, in depth approaches to investigate the mechanistic basis
of these findings. Experiments will investigate the LANA-DDR interaction and its role in viral genome silencing,
and suppression of lytic replication. We will investigate the dynamics and sites of deposition of key DDR
factors on the KSHV genome and LANA’s role in these events. Experiments will also investigate the role of the
DDR in establishing the KSHV repressive epigenome. The silencing of the KSHV genome following infection is
central to the establishment of viral latency, and this work therefore provides novel and important insight into a
fundamental component of KSHV biology."
10828807,"Summary
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and rates are on the rise,
indicating that safe and new approaches are urgently needed for treatment and prevention. Emerging evidence
suggests that a high-fat/low-fiber diet may promote CDI. Diets high in saturated fat lead to the production of
primary bile acids that can promote infection by germinating C. difficile spores. Diets deficient in fiber
perpetuate C. difficile colonization in mice, and this effect was linked at least in part with a loss of Short Chain
Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Our preliminary murine studies show that a high-fat/low-fiber diet resulted in increased
microbiome disturbance following broad spectrum antibiotic challenge, increased cecal levels of primary bile
acids that germinate C. difficile spores, markedly decreased levels of secondary bile acids that can kill C.
difficile, and increased morbidity and mortality upon C. difficile exposure. These results suggest that dietary
intervention has promise for preventing CDI in individuals at high risk. Aim 1A will determine the effects of
dietary levels of fat and fiber in preventing antibiotic induced gut microbiome disturbance and CDI,
using conventional mice fed varied diets. Aim 1B will directly evaluate the role of increased intestinal
levels of primary bile acids in the increased C. difficile pathogenicity by chemically inhibiting the ileal
apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter. Oncology patients have high incidence of CDI, driven by risk
factors that include frequent hospitalization, antibiotic use, and use of chemotherapeutic drugs. Aim 2 will test
a higher-fiber/lower-fat dietary intervention for prevention of C. difficile recurrence and maintenance of
gut microbiome diversity in oncology patients. Production of SCFAs may be one mechanism contributing
to the protective effects of fiber in CDI. Metabolism of the SCFA butyrate by intestinal epithelial cells plays a
key role in the establishment of intestinal hypoxia, which is important because reversion to hypoxia is a key
process in promoting the reestablishment of an anaerobe dominated complex gut microbiome following
disturbance. SCFA production from fiber is limited in individuals with a low complexity facultative anaerobe-
dominated microbiome, which is common in individuals with recurrent CDI. In our earlier work, we have
identified butyrate-producers, including Clostridium symbiosum and Anaerostipes caccae that specialize to
infant and disturbed guts and that can produce butyrate using a simple substrate, gluconic acid, as a sole
source of carbon. Thus, in Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that synbiotic treatment with disturbance
adapted butyrate-producers and gluconic acid will increase butyrate production, increase intestinal
hypoxia and facilitate the activity of anaerobic secondary bile acid producers that prevent CDI, using
mice humanized with a disturbed/ low-complexity microbiota."
10873007,"Tobacco use remains the number one preventable cause of death in the United States. Unfortunately, individuals
with mental health conditions are disproportionately affected. Tobacco use is also high among US Veterans, and
those who have experienced trauma are even more likely to smoke. Successful quitting is especially difficult for
individuals who develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite the efficacy of current evidence-based
pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies for smoking cessation, alternative treatments are critically needed.
Neuroimaging techniques such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have provided
insight into the neurocircuitry of tobacco use disorder (TUD) and successful quit attempts. Interventions that
modulate the neural systems underlying TUD, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), may be
critical to improving clinical outcomes. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently cleared a form
of rTMS as a short-term smoking cessation treatment in adults. However, most clinical trials on rTMS for smoking
cessation have been conducted in civilian samples and have excluded individuals with psychiatric conditions. To
improve smoking cessation treatment options for Veterans with PTSD, it is critical to evaluate novel brain
stimulation methods such as rTMS in this vulnerable population. Furthermore, the development of neuroscience-
informed techniques to enhance rTMS such as neuronavigation based on rs-fMRI is critical to individualizing rTMS
for smoking cessation and understanding mechanisms of action. The application of neuroimaging to develop
personalized rTMS targets to precisely modulate targeted underlying neurocircuitry has been successfully applied
to the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Similar methodology has been demonstrated successfully for
smoking cessation by the candidate’s mentors, but this work was completed in a sample of civilian participants
making a quit attempt who did not have psychiatric illness. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed research
aims to develop feasibility data for the therapeutic application individualized neuronavigated rTMS for Veterans
with PTSD attempting to quit smoking. Using a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, eligible
Veterans with PTSD (n=50) seeking smoking cessation will receive rs-fMRI before and after a 5-day course of
neuronavigated rTMS the week prior to their quit date, in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The scientific aims of the study are to evaluate feasibility of treatment delivery
procedures, develop preliminary effect size estimates, and demonstrate target engagement of the intervention
within neural networks critical to TUD. In addition, complementary training and mentoring plans will provide the
candidate with mentored clinical research training that supports the completion of the CDA-2 research study and
preparation a Merit Review award application. Specifically, the candidate will develop technical proficiency in rTMS
therapy and fMRI-based neuronavigation, proficiency in clinical trials, training, and experience in clinical research
domains relevant to Veteran health including PTSD and smoking cessation, and administrative, analytical and
grant writing skills. The proposed research study and training plan provide a platform for the candidate to develop
and implement a full RCT aimed at quantifying the efficacy of rs-fMRI-guided rTMS for smoking cessation in
Veterans with PTSD. Ultimately, this line of research will allow the candidate to establish independence as a
physician scientist at the Department of Veterans Affairs and to pursue a career on the development of non-
invasive neuromodulation treatments for Veterans with comorbid substance use and psychiatric disorders."
10770475,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Retinal detachments can cause significant vision loss and frequently begin as small breaks in the
peripheral retina (from ocular globe equator to the ora serrata). These breaks allow fluid to enter the sub-retinal
space, detaching the retina and leading to retinal ischemia and dysfunction. Laser photocoagulation (LP)
therapy can be utilized in the clinic reducing the risk of subsequent detachment tenfold (50% to 5%) but only if
breaks are detected early and before excess fluid has accumulated under the retina. The long-term goal is to
develop a system that provides 360° visualization of the peripheral retina replacing the current standard of care
for evaluation of the retinal periphery for breaks: indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression, a procedure
requiring the examiner to mechanically indent the eye at multiple locations and use an indirect ophthalmoscope
and condensing lens to attempt to visualize the retina peripherally and over 360°. The rationale for this project
is that in addition to being extremely uncomfortable for the patient, this technique requires considerable skill
with specialized training. Furthermore, the exam does not create a direct record of the findings – the examiner
must illustrate a guide map from memory for subsequent LP therapy utilizing this same manual technique.
These objectives will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Adapt a custom conical mirror contact lens
and robotically aligning platform to optically access the peripheral retina with OCT and laser photocoagulation
therapy; and 2) Validate peripheral retina robotically aligning OCT against scleral depressed exam in eyes with
and without peripheral retinal breaks requiring treatment. Under the first aim the conical mirror contact lens and
robotically aligning platform will be redesigned to deliver both OCT and LP therapy light to the peripheral retina.
The system will be validated for field-of-view and resolution and evaluated for the ability to deliver LP therapy
in ex vivo porcine eyes to created breaks throughout the peripheral retinal with real-time OCT image guidance.
Under the second aim, the robotically aligning OCT imaging system will be used in vivo. First a pilot study will
be performed on healthy subjects optimizing for robot-operator interactions. Upon completion, a powered study
will test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between paired differences in the number of breaks per
eye as observed by peripheral retina RAOCT versus clinical exam in eyes with and without peripheral retinal
breaks requiring treatment. The proposed research is technically innovative, in the applicant’s opinion,
because it directly addresses optical issues for accessing and aligning to the retinal periphery by using a
custom conical mirror contact designed for use with OCT and LP therapy coupled with 3D tracking and
compensation. The proposed research is further clinically innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it
provides the first 360° comprehensive assessment of the peripheral retina. This is a direct path to provide real-
time image guided LP therapy to the full retinal periphery."

ABSTRACT
This U19 re-competing proposal entitled “Pathophysiologic and Therapeutic Mechanisms of Aspirin Exacerbated
Respiratory Disease” seeks to understand the mechanisms of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
(CRSwNP) and aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) at a multi-omic molecular and cellular level. The
Integrative Genomics Core (IGC) will utilize cutting-edge technologies and computational methods, many of
which were developed by our group, to support the objectives of the three Projects, each of which is focused
on a different aspect of Type II immunopathology (T2I). The IGC will be based at the Raychaudhuri lab at the
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), where the BWH Single Cell Genomics Core is also based. The IGC is
composed of researchers with 10+ years of experience leading large-scale functional genomics projects,
processing large datasets, and performing statistical analyses to integrate different layers of multi-dimensional
information for the understanding of immune-mediated diseases. The IGC has a robust informatics infrastructure
where terabytes of data can be stored and high-performance computing jobs can be run. Specifically, the IGC
will (i) generate the single-cell and bulk datasets profiling RNA, open chromatin and protein levels for all three
Projects, (ii) process and perform the quality check of each dataset, (iii) apply normalization and batch correction
procedures, (iv) perform reproducible bioinformatic and statistical analyses, and (v) archive all experimental data

10873717,"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), a type of cognitive disorder mainly induced by
cerebrovascular pathology and dysfunction, is widely recognized as the second most common cause of
dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, and results in tremendous economic and social burdens on our society.
Despite recent progress in VCID research, our understanding of cerebrovascular contributions to the
pathogenesis of VCID is still limited, and the effective therapeutic approaches for VCID are unavailable.
 Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors and consist of 18
members that have been shown to play key roles in cellular growth and differentiation. Cumulative studies
have documented that several KLFs (KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, KLF6, KLF8, KLF11, KLF13, KLF14, and KLF15) are
implicated in developmental and pathological vascular processes. It is becoming apparent that KLFs are also
implicated in regulating the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases and warrant further investigation. KLF11
is a unique diabetes-associated KLF transcription factor among 18 KLF family members and is highly
expressed in vascular endothelium. We reported for the first time that KLF11 functions as an important
mediator in acute stroke-induced brain injury. However, the function and mechanisms of KLF11 in regulating
cerebrovascular pathogenesis and progression of cognitive decline are totally unknown in VCID.
 In our recent preliminary studies, we have shown that KLF11 expression is significantly decreased in the
mouse cerebral vasculature after VCID. Of note, EC-selective KLF11 transgenic overexpression displays
reduced cognitive impairments in the experimental VCID mouse model, whereas KLF11 genetic deficiency
results in increased cognitive impairments, white matter injury and neuronal loss. Mechanistically, we have
documented that KLF11 genetic deficiency increased BBB permeability in mice after VCID. We further found
several KLF11 binding sites in the promoter region of major endothelial tight junctions, and genetic deletion of
KLF11 in VCID mice significantly reduced cerebral expression of claudin-5. These findings have provided the
basis for our Central Hypothesis that vascular KLF11 attenuates BBB disruption and subsequent
pathological cascades after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, thereby contributing to increased BBB
stabilization, reduced white matter/neuronal loss, and improved long-term cognitive outcomes in VCID.
Three specific aims will be performed in this proposal. Aim 1: Define the role of vascular KLF11 in long-term
cognitive disorders, brain white matter injury, and neuronal loss in experimental VCID; Aim 2: Elucidate the
mechanisms of vascular KLF11-mediated brain protection in VCID; Aim 3: Explore systematic delivery of TAT-
KLF11 protein as a potential therapy in VCID. Elucidating KLF11 cerebrovascular protection may help us to
discover vascular contribution to brain white and grey matter injury and dementia, and lead us to develop novel
and effective treatment against VCID."

Core B – FSH Glycoform Production, Purification and Analysis
Core B provides critical and requisite reagents, analyses, and expertise to support all of the Projects in fulfilling
their Specific Aims. Specifically, Core B will continue to produce recombinant hFSH glycoforms and mutant hFSH
glycoforms. Procedures have been established to produce milligram quantities of glycoform variants from the
conditioned medium of cultured GH3 cells transfected with the human FSH a and b subunit genes, CGA and
FSHB, respectively, or mutant FSHB genes. Core B will continue to develop transfection systems to improve
mutant hFSH glycoform production to supply hormone to all four Projects. These hFSH variants mimic known
recombinant hypoglycosylated hFSH glycoforms in terms of their actions upon ovarian cells. Core B will continue
to work with Project 4(Bousfield), to generate and assess antibodies that recognize specifically intact hFSH,
hFSH a subunit, as well as individual glycoform b subunits, for use in glycoform isolation and detection. Core B
will provide a variety of cells for use in Project 2(Davis), Project 3(Jonas), and Project 4(Bousfield) to assess
glycoform receptor binding, FSH receptor oligomerization, FSH receptor mediated signal transduction and
glycoform impact upon cell differentiation. Cells to be furnished include KGN cells, a human granulosa cell line
that responds to hFSH stimulation; CHO cells that express the human FSH receptor; and primary porcine
granulosa cells which naturally express the FSH receptor to complete on-going experiments. GH3 and HEK293
cells transfected with hFSH and mutated genes are critical for the production of recombinant hFSH glycoforms.
Core B will provide analysis support for the Projects including: FSH RIA and ELISA to monitor hFSH levels
during FSH glycoform production and in various biological fluids including serum and urine; mouse FSH ELISA
for Project 1(Kumar); FSH and LH receptor binding; progesterone ELISA to monitor hFSH variant impact upon
target cell function; and hFSH variant antigen ELISA for monoclonal antibody screening. Core B will obtain and
develop studies utilizing porcine cumulus oocyte complexes (pCOCs) to assess potential differential activities of
hFSH glycoform variants upon COC expansion and gene expression."
10843323,"Although glycochemistry has developed in leaps and bounds in the last two decades,
the synthesis of a complex oligosaccharide or of a glycoconjugate remains a very
challenging albeit critically important task. The difficulties inherent in such syntheses
arise because of numerous reasons that center on the complexity of the chemistry when
compared to that of oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis. The most important
reactions in any oligosaccharide synthesis are the formation of the glycosidic bonds and
there exists many empirical methods toward this end.
 The longstanding theme of this grant has been that the rationalization of complex
oligosaccharide synthesis is best achieved by an improved understanding of the
mechanisms of glycosidic bond formation, coupled with the development of more
efficient, straightforward and general mechanism-based methods. Progress along these
lines has transformed by the way we think about glycosidic bond formation to the extent
that predictions can now be made. One aspect of this proposal addresses remaining
issues in glycosidation mechanisms through the development of cation clock methods
for the determination of reaction kinetics in sialic acid glycosidic bond formation. A
further aspect of this proposal is the mechanism-based prediction of reactivity leading to
the development of a novel method for the control of anomeric stereoselectivity through
the control of side chain conformation. Finally, the knowledge of how side chain
conformation affects reactivity is related to transition state stabilization by glycoside
hydrolases and glycosyltransferases, resulting in the design of improved inhibitors for
such critical carbohydrate processing enzymes."
10834171,"Abstract: Stenosis and/or regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves imposes an excess load on the left
ventricle (LV). The LV can compensate for this load for some time by undergoing hypertrophy and/or dilation,
but ultimately fails. It is well recognized that replacement or repair of the valve before the development of overt
heart failure improves outcome. More recently, experimental data have suggested that early intervention, before
the development of subclinical LV fibrosis, can also improve outcome. This realization, coupled with the growing
ability to replace/repair the aortic and mitral valves with catheter-based techniques, has made the need to detect
early fibrosis and other subclinical changes in LV microstructure even more pressing. Here we propose a two-
pronged approach involving diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the LV and RNA-sequencing of the extracellular
vesicles in blood. Our group has played a major role in the development of DTI in the heart and has shown that
it can provide unique readouts of cardiomyocyte orientation, anisotropy and disorder. Here we will use a novel
ultra-high resolution DTI technique, recently developed in our group, that involves the use of a tailored 64-
element radiofrequency coil, a spatially-selective 2D excitation pulse, diffusion-encoding gradients compensated
for the first and second moments of motion, and a reconstruction scheme using low-rank tensor modeling and a
multitasking framework. This approach has improved the spatial resolution of in vivo DTI data by almost an order
of magnitude and has allowed us to detect hitherto unknown microstructural patterns in the LV. This novel deep-
phenotyping technique will be integrated with a novel approach for genotyping the LV, which involves the
sequencing of mRNAs contained in the extracellular vesicles secreted into the blood. We hypothesize that
pressure and volume overload will produce significant changes in both the transcriptome and microstructure of
the LV well before the onset of overt dysfunction. We further hypothesize that these changes are plastic and
may be reversible with timely removal of the excess load. In aim 1, we will study subjects across the broad
phenotypic spectrum of aortic stenosis. In aim 2, we will study subjects with aortic and mitral regurgitation. In
aim 3 of the proposal we will characterize the impact of valve replacement/repair on the microstructure and
transcriptome of the LV. Execution of the study will provide important insights into the pathophysiology of valvular
heart disease and provide new tools to assess risk and guide the timing of valve replacement/repair. As the
armamentarium of catheter-based techniques continues to grow, this proposal addresses a large knowledge gap
and an unmet clinical need and, therefore, is of major medical and public health significance."
10847382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mammalian cells often use their actin cytoskeleton simultaneously for multiple functions, including cell motility,
endocytosis, vesicular trafficking, and to establish and maintain cell polarity. Although they accomplish different
tasks, functionally distinct actin networks share structural components and regulators that can include
polymerization factors, polymer bundlers, and proteins that promote network turnover. This molecular
multitasking by mammalian cells makes it difficult to determine how cells control subsets of actin functions. In
contrast, budding and fission yeast have highly simplified actin networks that have been used to develop
simple models of actin network control. The vast differences between yeast and human actin networks,
howevxer, make it difficult to understand which principles of actin cytoskeletal regulation are shared. Chytrid
fungi represent a natural bridge between the well-understood actin networks of yeast and the elaborate actin
networks of human cells for three reasons. First, the evolutionary position of chytrids falls between yeast and
human cells. Second, they have retained important actin regulators that have been lost by yeast, making their
actin networks are intermediate in complexity. Third, and most importantly, chytrid fungi undergo a natural
developmental transition from human-like crawling cells to a yeast-like cell type. We are therefore using chytrid
fungi to study the evolution and specification of actin networks relevant to human health. We have identified a
large number of chytrid actin cytoskeletal regulators similar to actin regulators found in human cells, as well as
additional fungal-specific actin regulators. We have also recently developed methods to control the switch from
the human-like to the yeast-like cells, as well as methods for molecular transformation and exogenous gene
expression. We will use these approaches to determine the mechanisms that control animal-like and yeast-like
actin networks in chytrids and the developmental transitions between them. This work will help us determine
how actin regulatory systems give rise to the observed diversity of actin networks across developmental
transitions and evolutionary time."

this Training Program offers a plan of study tailored to the individual needs and interests of students who come
to us from a variety of backgrounds in the basic biological sciences, including biology, biochemistry, chemistry,
molecular biology, psychology and neuroscience. A collegial and collaborative community of educators and
investigators create a challenging but supportive environment within which students develop into successful
neuroscientists. Program Goals are to provide our students: I) a curriculum that gives them a foundation of
fundamental concepts in Neuroscience; II) experience and knowledge to conduct rigorous research; III)
professional skills and training in ethical behavior and responsible conduct that will prepare them for impactful
careers as neuroscientists; and IV) a culture that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion, and an awareness of
their responsibility to promote diversity in their profession. These goals form the basis for a program evaluation
process, with relevant metrics and outcomes, that informs the ongoing evolution of our program, including
additions and improvements to curriculum, professional development and enrichment activities, and other
elements of the program. Trainee progress is facilitated and monitored by a robust administrative structure and
an experienced program leadership. Students enter the IBMS and are fully supported in year 1 by the graduate
school. In the first semester they take a common biomedical sciences course and conduct lab rotations. They
join a lab and begin the Neuroscience curriculum in the spring semester. Students to be supported by this T32
training grant are selected at the end of the first summer, to be supported during their second year of study,
during which they complete the core Neuroscience coursework, conduct a Clinical Practicum in Neuroscience,
develop their research project, and engage in several enrichment and professional development activities
before completing the Qualifying Exam at the end of year 2. In the year following support, students present
their dissertation proposal and submit individual fellowship applications. Other advanced-stage T32s on our
campus may support post-QE Neuroscience students working in relevant areas. Our program has been
successful, with a 91% retention and completion rate, and to date, 97% of students who completed their
degree proceeded to research-intensive or -related positions. We have a strong history of successful outcomes
training students from under-represented populations, while maintaining national competitiveness. Renewed

10907421,"The science proposed in this program takes advantage of the unique scientific opportunity created by the
ongoing coronavirus pandemic, to study the interaction between a definable and time-limited risk-inducing
environmental event (exposure to the virus) and genomic variation on the occurrence of cognitive decline and
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in large cohorts of older adults from underrepresented
minorities in the USA and ancestral groups in Africa and South America. The investigators leading the program
have extensive experience in directing international consortia and longitudinal cohorts, including the creation
and follow up of an Amerindian cohort in the Andes region for longer than a decade. We have pilot
ascertainment of cognitive impairment end-points in newly recruited older adults of Amerindian ancestry. This
U19 will investigate the interactions between whole genome sequence genetic variations and COVID-19
infection and disease on the risk of cognitive decline and risk of ADRD in 4,300 individuals as part of newly
recruited cohorts in Texas, New York, Washington State, Ibadan (Nigeria), and Jujuy (Argentina). Participant
assessments will include neurological, cognitive, imaging and blood-based biomarker evaluations using
harmonized protocols and at 3 time points: within a few months of infection and 18 and 36 months afterwards.
We propose to answer this complex research question with 3 highly integrated Projects supported by equally
integrated Administrative, Clinical, Neuroimaging and Data Management/Statistics Cores. All projects involve
integrated multidisciplinary teams of investigators within a consortium of institutions including University of
Texas Health San Antonio, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Washington University School of Medicine,
Albert Einstein College of Medicine, University of Washington, University of Ibadan, the Ministry of Health of
the Province of Jujuy (Argentina) and the FULTRA Foundation (Argentina). Resources and study expertise will

10907435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 By 2050, more than 2 billion people worldwide will be over the age of 65, with older adults outnumbering
children for the first time in recorded history. This predicted major demographic shift highlights the importance
of improving our understanding of factors that contribute to healthy brain aging. Currently, the biological bases
of brain aging are poorly understood. Brain aging (often focused on cognitive decline) is characterized by
numerous phenotypes that undoubtedly involve multiple environmental and genetic factors. Overtly
pathological brain aging is seen in major neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD); the prevalence of ADRD is expected to double every 20 years. On top of this existing
public health crisis, we are now experiencing a global pandemic that appears to negatively influence
neurological function. Growing evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological
complications of short-term consequence including acute neuropathy, encephalopathy, anosmia, and
hypoxic/ischemic brain injury, and longer-term consequences including cognitive impairment and
neuropsychiatric disturbances.
 The interindividual variation in the neurobiological responses to SARS-CoV-2 is marked. As with most
complex phenotypes, causal determinants likely include both genetic and environmental factors. However, no
genetic epidemiological study has yet considered differential neurophenotypic response to infection. Thus,
delineating the genetic architecture of ADRD-relevant neurophenotypic responses to SARS-CoV-2 will offer
important biological insights, which in turn could provide strategies for fostering healthy brain aging in the
presence of future infectious challenges. Our project will assess the genetic basis of ADRD-relevant
endophenotypic response (across a two year period with three examinations) to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a set
of older (>60 years of age) adults from diverse populations (Amerindians from Argentina [ n=3000], US Native
Americans [n=250], Mexican Americans [n=500], Puerto Ricans [n=125], African Americans [n=125], and
Africans [n=300]) using whole genome sequence (WGS) data in a case/control design (75% post-infection
cases, 25% never infected controls). The data generated will enable estimating the importance of genetics in
disease response and the identification of key genes involved in the response. Our specific aims are to: 1)
detect genetic influences on endophenotypic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection using WGS data through
testing for genotype×infection interaction in neurocognitive measures (neurocognitive measures, neuroimaging
measures, and blood-based biomarkers); 2) search for sequence variation in genes and gene pathways
influencing response to SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 3) test whether between-population variation in mean
responses to infection has a genetic component. This project represents the genetic component of a large,
integrated U19 application to examine the effect of COVID-19 on risk for ADRD in understudied ethnicities.
Through the proposed project, we will identify causal genetic factors that underly differential response in ADRD
risk to COVID-19."
10907439,"The overall goal of this project is to discover neural signatures of COVID-19-associated cognitive impairment at
the group-contrast level using volumetric, surface-based, and tract-based metrics. The overall hypothesis is that
COVID-19-associated dementia will exhibit unique neural signatures discoverable through multi-modality
neuroimaging. As our first foray, we will employ group-wise analytic strategies measuring: 1) gray-matter
functional alterations using functional MRI (fMRI); 2) gray-matter atrophy using structural MRI (sMRI); and, 3)
white-matter abnormalities using sMRI. Preliminary data (de Erasquin et al., in review) indicate that ~50% of
post-COVID-19 enrollees over 60 years of age will be cognitively impaired, providing a balanced sample
(demented:non-demented∷1:1). It is known that changes will be chronic – lasting at least 6 months – but it is not
yet known whether cognitive impairment will be recuperative, progressive, or mixed.
Aim 1: Gray-matter Functional Signature & Connectomics. Gray-matter functional alterations will be evaluated
using voxel-based physiological (VBP) metrics computed from BOLD fMRI times series. BOLD-based VBP
metrics will be supplemented by fMRI blood flow (BF) in all cohorts and PET measures of glucose metabolic rate
(MRglu) in the Texas cohort, for cross validation. Connectomic alterations will be assessed by group independent
components analysis (GICA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) of T2* BOLD time series.
Aim 2: Gray-matter Structural Signature. Gray-matter structural alterations (atrophy and hypertrophy) will be
evaluated using both volumetric and surface-based analyses.
Aim 3: White-matter Structural Signature. White matter integrity will be evaluated using tract-based, volumetric
and lesion-counting analytics.
Aim 4 Exploratory analyses. Features discovered through group-wise contrasts (Aims 1-3) will be tested for
overlap with known patterns (e.g., AD/MCI, healthy aging, metabolic syndrome, immune mediated, etc.). They
will also be tested at the per-subject level as predictors of group membership (COVID +/-; cognitive impairment
+/-) and co-analyzed as quantitative biomarkers and endophenotypes with Projects 1 and 2.
Hypotheses 1: In the post-acute state of COVID-19 infection, persons with cognitive impairment will exhibit
abnormalities in an EON and likely other as-yet-undefined neural signatures of CNS COVID severally defined
by the above-described neuroimaging measures when contrasted either to non-impaired COVID-19 survivors or
to non-COVID controls.
Hypothesis 2: The strength of the neural signatures will be symptom-severity correlated, but not the pattern.
Hypothesis 3: The neural signatures will be time invariant, other than due to symptom-severity variation.
Hypothesis 4: The neural signatures will be cohort invariant, other than due to symptom-severity variation."
10880530,"The I-SPY Program Project advances the goals of personalized treatment in the setting of an advanced clinical trial design
that facilitates continuous improvement in outcomes. In this program, we focus on women with stage 2 and 3 molecularly
high-risk, early breast cancer who have the highest risk for rapid progression and death. The I-SPY2.2 program project
allows us to generate a patient-centric approach to clinical drug development that optimizes individual, biomarker-
targeted treatments by escalation or de-escalation of therapy based on treatment response, doing so in the context of a trial
that efficiently evaluates novel potential first-line agents and treatment regimens. The lessons and insights developed in
this program project will be broadly applicable beyond breast cancer to other cancers and to clinical trial design.
The continuation of the I-SPY2.2 program project will provide the resources for the discovery research that ultimately
will increase complete response (pCR) and prevent metastases. The proposed four projects and three shared resource cores
will allow us to create strategies for combining multiple biomarker analytes from the tumor and derivatives assessed in
circulation to build better and better predictive models of lack of response and poor outcome in the neoadjuvant setting
and further identify ‘druggable’ targets in residual disease to alleviate resistance. The I-SPY program and the Program
Project have, in effect, established a continuous improvement system for breast cancer treatment outcomes, enabling us to
drive progress in precision medicine for breast cancer, importantly, using a highly patient-centric framework. The iterative
process will lead to more and better targeting of therapies by leveraging biologic insights, refinement of response-
predictive biomarkers, and integration of both efficacy and impact on quality of life. The combination of these elements
will save lives, reduce morbidity and set the stage for improved personalization and translation to clinical practice.
In the past 5 years of the I-SPY2.2 program project, we have met all of our stated aims, creating and implementing (June
2022) a novel, innovative trial design to both test novel agents and individualize care over the course of the treatment. In
the subsequent five years, we will iteratively refine the processes to optimize outcomes through early de-escalation of
treatment in the setting of success, and early escalation of treatment in the setting of minimal response, based on our
innovations in establishing and refining quantitative breast MRI as a biomarker of response assessment. We will use
integrated molecular and immune response-predictive subtypes developed in the first five years to assign treatments for
targeted agents initially without standard chemotherapeutics, but then in sequence if response is not sufficient. We will
randomize treatments based on the improved, response-predicted subtypes we developed to test their ability to precisely
assign treatments. We will use a sequential multiple assignment approach (SMART) to identify optimal sequences of
therapy and use the framework to integrate a seamless phase 2/3 trial that will speed the process of getting the most effective,
least toxic treatment strategies to women in the shortest possible time. The infrastructure of the proposed program project
and the tightly integrated, experienced multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the goals of the program will enable us to
accomplish our goals and impact the lives of women with high-risk breast cancer."

Substantial changes have occurred in the practice of clinical GI surgery over the past decade, and, in addition,
surgical research has evolved to now encompass a much broader range of available techniques and
approaches. This T32 Program has been designed to train the next generation of academic GI surgeons through
a focus on the wide array of investigative fields that are now being applied to the study of GI surgical disease.
The enormous resources and talented personnel in the Harvard Medical School community have been leveraged
to create a unique environment for the research training of our future academic GI surgeons. First funded in
1997 as a collaboration between the Departments of Surgery at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the
former Beth Israel Hospital, this program has been expanded to include investigators from all four major teaching
hospital affiliates of Harvard Medical School (CH, BIDMC, BWH, MGH). We have made enormous efforts to
break down the existing ""silo"" effects that exist in most research enterprises by bringing together investigators
from various disciplines. Accordingly, this T32 Program is now comprised of four research tracks: (1) Basic
Science, (2) Clinical Research/Outcomes (3) Surgical Technology/lnnovation, and (4) Surgical Education. The
Program has been designed to bring surgeon-scientists together from these four different investigative
disciplines, establishing a unique environment for collaboration and interaction. The Training Program Executive
Committee (Zara Cooper, Allan Goldstein, Richard Hodin, Tara Kent, Mark Puder, and Ali Tavakkoli) will oversee
the selection of trainees, designation of preceptors, prescription of formal coursework, and participation in
programs teaching ethics and the responsible conduct in research. The Program is open to surgical residents
or fellows in accredited U.S. Residency Programs and a pro-active process is in place to seek applications from
individuals belonging to under-represented minority groups. We are requesting a total of six trainee slots per
year, each intended for a post-doctoral trainee for a two-year fellowship period. This T32 Program is therefore
designed to provide intensive, coordinated research training with the goal of preparing individuals to become
independently funded investigators in the field of alimentary tract surgery."

tau and amyloid oligomers, synaptic electrophysiology and, DNA damage and repair in neurodegeneration,
genetics of synaptic development and degeneration, molecular mechanisms in cognitive resilience, and
metabolic determinants of neurodegeneration. A strength of our training program is the investment UTMB has
made in developing this highly collaborative team as demonstrated by our joint publications and funded grants.
Our four pre-and three post-doctoral trainees will be closely mentored throughout their training. Our pre-doctoral
trainees will be required to take several new courses devoted to the cellular signaling in neurodegeneration and
the biochemistry and biophysics of amyloid proteins, while our post-doctoral trainees will participate in a
certificate program in advanced biomedical research strategies. All trainees will participate in seminars,
community building events, journal clubs and active collaborative research training. We have proposed a
framework that will enable us to train and mentor both pre- and post-doctoral trainees on their way to becoming
independent scientist to help address the Alzheimer’s medical needs of the country."
10851992,"SUMMARY: Circulating Extracellular Vesicles in the Pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by death, dedifferentiation or dysfunction of
functional beta cells. However, precise molecular events that initiate beta cell loss and dysfunction or mediate
autoimmunity is a major gap in knowledge that remains unaddressed. Emerging evidence suggests that circulating
extracellular vesicles (EVs), known mediators of intercellular microcommunication, may play important roles in the
pathogenesis of T1D. However, their precise function and molecular contents, especially in the initiation of beta
cell loss and dysfunction in humans are largely undefined.
Here, we hypothesize that circulating EVs in T1D, through their distinct molecular characteristics, are
cytotoxic to beta cell health, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of T1D, with the potential to serve as
biomarkers for early disease diagnosis. Our preliminary data suggests that EVs, but not EV-depleted fraction
in the humoral factors in T1D are cytotoxic, particularly to human beta cells, but not to alpha cells. Specifically,
EVs from T1D subjects, but not from control subjects, induce human beta cell death suggesting that circulating
T1D-EVs are key components contributing to humoral cytotoxicity. Therefore, characterizing T1D EVs at various
stages of the disease and control could identify important biomarkers for early detection of the disease that
correlate with beta cell loss and dysfunction. Our research plan has the following Specific Aims:
AIM 1: To determine the functional effects of circulating EVs from pre-disease to late stage T1D subjects
on human beta and alpha cell health. We will characterize circulating EVs from the plasma of T1D subjects at
i) early (1-5 years), ii) late (>10 year) and iii) pediatric (<18 year) stages and compare them with i) autoantibody
positive non-T1D, ii) T2D (control for secondary effects such as hyperglycemia) and iii) appropriate age, ethnicity,
and sex-matched healthy control non-diabetic subjects for their effect on human beta and alpha cell health.
AIM 2: To establish the functional role of circulating EVs in the pathogenesis of T1D in vivo using a rodent
model. To provide proof-of-concept, we will administer circulating EVs from diabetic female NOD mice to non-
diabetic controls and test T1D disease progression in the recipient (Aim2A); we will inhibit EV secretion in young
pre-T1D female NOD mice and test T1D disease progression and quantify beta cell death and function (Aim2B).
AIM 3: Investigate the molecular mechanisms, cargo composition and cargo function of human T1D-
EVs. We will address the differential function of T1D EVs in beta cell cytotoxicity by investigating their uptake
mechanisms, (Aim3A); compare EV cargo in T1D and control subjects (Aim3B); examine the function of
differentially expressed EV-RNAs (Aim3C).
Our proposed research is clinically relevant and will profoundly change our understanding of the progression of
T1D. If successful, our study has the potential to identify new biomarkers and therapeutics for T1D."

There is strong evidence that maladaptive behaviors, including poor sleep hygiene and binge drinking, emerge
in the college environment. When repeated in cycles, risk of habit development increases. This may contribute
to the development of addiction, psychiatric illness, and physical disease. Both chronic sleep deprivation and
frequent excessive alcohol use disrupt behavioral and physiological functioning, and their relationship appears
reciprocal. Research on individual differences in the alcohol-sleep relationship is largely unexplored, but may
identify putative biomarkers for immediate and long-term risks of alcohol misuse. This proposal's public health
significance stems from its potential to reduce immediate alcohol-related harms in college students and
develop scientific premise for improving the lives of individuals with sleep and alcohol use disorders. Proposed
studies build from an ongoing longitudinal study of college students (R01 AA027017), using its participants,
weekly drinking data, and physiological protocols. It maps the sleep-alcohol relationship onto individual
drinking bouts. It pairs self-reported sleep quality with objective measures of sleep behavior (actigraphy) and
physiology (polysomnography) that are collected before, during, and after a drinking bout. Sleep is
operationalized as a multidimensional and dynamic behavior that is measurable within and across discrete
episodes. Self-reported alcohol use and consequences are paired with a cardiovascular reactivity test that
objectively assesses proximal physiological repercussions of drinking. Study 1 (n= 150) is a one-week
actigraphy study of sleep duration, timing, and fragmentation. Aim 1 focuses on sleep behaviors preceding a
drinking event (i.e., pre-intoxication) and assesses how cumulative sleep debt and sleep irregularity influence
individual differences in the immediate consequences of drinking measured from self-report and cardiovascular
reactivity. Aim 2 targets sleep on the night of a drinking event (i.e., during intoxication) and assesses individual
differences in acute alcohol effects on sleep quantity and quality, as well as associations with alcohol use
behaviors across the subsequent week and over 2-years. Study 2 (n=25) involves at-home, overnight
polysomnography sessions on a night following a drinking night and on a night that does not follow drinking to
assess sleep architecture (e.g., time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep) changes. Aim
3 explores how sleep is altered during recovery (i.e., post-intoxication) from drinking and if individual
differences in sleep physiology relate to sleep behavior and cardiovascular physiology. This application
innovates through its use of multi-level assessments of sleep and alcohol use; concurrently collecting objective
data may help dissociate contextual influences on self-report. It also innovates with a multi-PI design that
ensures primary expertise in both the alcohol and sleep fields. Added value for the proposed studies comes
from the resulting intensive, day-level, longitudinal data that has the potential to generate secondary analyses
focused on event-level data of within-subject alcohol-sleep relationships across time."

 This continuation application proposes to support three (3) pre-doctoral and three (3) post-doctoral trainees
with 24 faculty from six (6) colleges and 10 departments across the University of Kentucky. The
accomplishments of our trainees exemplify the success of this training program. Forty-seven (47) percent of
trainees from 15 years ago have received funding from NIH. Trainees from the past 10 years are also
beginning to experience success in terms of acquiring extramural funding (i.e., 17% obtained NIH funding).
Trainees (N=14) from the most recent funding period authored 157 publications and regularly presented their
research findings at local, national, or international conferences. All of these trainees remain involved in
research or academics. Individuals from under-represented minorities comprised the 14% of the most recent
cohort. Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds comprised the 21% of the most recent cohort of trainees.
 The program is designed to prepare trainees to assume translational and multidisciplinary research
responsibilities in academic and other scientific organizations concerned with substance-use disorders (SUDs).
Pre-doctoral trainees concentrate in translational and interdisciplinary aspects of SUDs as part of a doctoral
program in a behavioral science discipline (e.g., psychology, sociology). Post-doctoral fellows have a doctorate
in a behavioral science discipline and are preparing for a research role in SUDs, or they are health
professionals seeking translational and interdisciplinary training in a behavioral orientation in SUDs research.
Basic elements of the program include: (1) training in the basic building blocks of research (e.g., experimental
design, data analysis) and independent research competence; (2) a translational and interdisciplinary
orientation taking students beyond their basic discipline and providing exposure to key theoretical concepts
and methodological issues of the related behavioral sciences along with a bio-behavioral conceptualization; (3)
professional development to support a career in SUDs research; (4) exploration of SUDs topics from a
medical-behavioral perspective through courses offered by training faculty; and (5) opportunities for research
around relevant questions in SUDs constituting a dissertation project for pre-doctoral trainees. We individually
tailor the post-doctoral program to the objectives of the fellows to build on their previous knowledge and
experience while drawing on the core elements of the training program.
 The rich environment provides opportunities for translational and multidisciplinary bio-behavioral research.
This T32 is unique in being the only institutional training grant at the University Kentucky funded by NIDA and
dedicated to the study of SUDs. The need for a translational and interdisciplinary program such as the one
proposed for continuation here is greater today than ever before. The United States is gripped by an
unprecedented SUD and overdose crisis."

Mexican Americans who live in the U.S.-Mexico border region suffer disproportionately from
preventable cardiometabolic diseases. Regular brisk walking is an effective measure in
regulating metabolic processes and preventing disease. Employer-based wellness programs
are promising strategies to address this public health problem because they take advantage of
workplace environments to improve opportunities for MVPA engagement while also addressing
barriers associated with inactivity. Employer-based MVPA programs have not been widely
tested on the U.S.-Mexico border. We plan to conduct a clustered Sequential Multiple
Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to determine the effectiveness of an employer-based
walking challenge intervention- 50,000 for Life (50K4Life)- in improving brisk walking
engagement (at least 7,000 steps/day) among school district employees. The proposed
intervention strategies are based on the walking interventions conducted by PI Salinas in El
Paso and behavioral, environmental and worksite interventions by the Co-Investigators. The trial
will include 30 randomly selected public schools with predominantly Mexican American
employees from El Paso County area school districts. The intervention strategies in 50K4Life
will be in two phases: 1) 50K4Life vs. 50K4Life + SMS text messaging and 2) Individual vs.
School level adaptation for campuses with a low response to the initial intervention phase. We
hypothesize that walking challenges with multilevel capacity building and adaptations based on
intervention response will lead to improved adherence to PA guidelines. This proposed socio-
ecological model-based study leverages resources through Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI)
from Texas and expertise in employer-based workplace interventions from the University of
Georgia (UGA) based on the partner's accumulative work to address the disparity in PA and
advance health equity in the Mexican American population. As part of our intervention
evaluation, we will conduct a process evaluation and cost-effectiveness to provide insight into
cost and scalability. This study will provide needed information on optimizing the implementation
of evidence-based behavioral interventions to improve walking engagement among Mexican
Americans living in the U.S.-Mexico border region."
10866392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Zebrafish are one of the most broadly used research model systems because they are easy to breed, manipulate, and
image. It is this immense utility that has led to the creation of tens of thousands of transgenic, reporter, and mutant lines
that have been instrumental in our understanding of biology, characterizing disease, and discovering new therapeutics, to
name only a few. Despite zebrafish being relatively cheap to house, maintaining large stocks of live fish indefinitely is
associated with facility space, personnel, and maintenance costs that also risks the loss of irreplaceable research lines due
to catastrophic events and genetic modifications. In this capacity, a safe and reliable method for cryopreservation of
zebrafish lines would provide a means to bank precious resources for the research community. Consequently, this project
aims to develop a zebrafish embryo and larvae cryopreservation protocol that is compatible with different storage
temperatures and to train external labs with an easy to implement protocol through extensive dissemination efforts.
While the field has been relatively successful in establishing sperm banks for a range of fish, egg/embryo
cryopreservation has been met with severe challenges, despite the clear advantages. Cryopreservation of sperm requires at
least 6 months to generate an adult strain, in contrast to cryopreservation of embryos that would enable more rapid and
direct use upon thawing. However, the two main cryopreservation approaches – slow cooling and vitrification – each have
severe limitations that have remained insurmountable. Slow cooling uses low concentrations of cryoprotectant agents
(CPAs) yet must compete with extensive ice formation that can damage cells. Alternatively, ice-free methods, such as
vitrification, require high concentration of toxic CPAs and high cooling rates that limit scalability. Instead, we propose a
relatively unexplored method termed interrupted cooling.
Interrupted cooling uses low concentrations of CPAs as samples are slowly cooled to high subzero temperatures (~-20°C)
with limited ice formation, before a rapid cooling protocol to deep cryogenic temperatures that converts the remaining
unfrozen fraction into a vitreous-like state. This flexible protocol enables both a short-term preservation step at high
subzero temperatures and a long-term preservation solution for zebrafish banking that is compatible with dry ice for
shipment and liquid nitrogen for reliable in-house storage. This will be achieved by applying first principles in
cryopreservation to design a storage solution and interrupted cooling protocol that will protect complex systems without
adverse functional consequences (Specific Aim 1). These efforts will be enhanced by applying lessons from wood frogs in
nature to improve zebrafish survival after thawing (Specific Aim 2). Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will perform extensive
dissemination efforts with non-study staff and create publicly available training tools for the broader community."
10848214,"Perforin 2 controls unconventional cytokine release from mucosal APC
Project Summary
How professional antigen presenting cell (APC) populations focally deliver cytokines to T cells for shaping the
pro-inflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory status of mucosal tissue remains incompletely understood. In particular,
cytokines that lack N-terminal peptide sequence such as the IL-1 family cytokine IL-33 can't access conventional
protein secretion pathways, which has led to the prevailing view that cell death is responsible for IL-33 release.
This project is built upon an exciting set of preliminary data demonstrating that mucosal conventional dendritic
cell (cDC) subsets, in both humans and mice, express the transmembrane pore-forming protein Perforin-2, which
at least in mice, facilitates IL-33 secretion. While in human cDC, we find Perforin-2 expression primarily in an
interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) subset indicating the cDC2 lineage, in mouse cDC, we find Perforin-2 in the
CD103+ cDC1 subset known to express the transcription factors Irf8 and Batf3. Irrespective of this lineage
distinction, both human and mouse CD11c+ cells in the respiratory mucosa contain cytoplasmic IL-33 protein.
Our data demonstrate that inhibition of Perforin-2 activity prevents IL-33 release from cDC and inhibits the
proliferative expansion of a poorly understood ST2+GATA3+Foxp3+Treg subset. Given that Perforin-2 has been
shown to also regulate Type 1 IFN signaling through controlling IFNAR responsiveness, we propose an important
regulatory mechanism exists in humans and mice that is dependent upon mucosal APC that express Perforin-2.
This project tests the central hypothesis that APC require Perforin-2 as an inducible plasma membrane
conduit for unconventional cytokine delivery at the mucosal interface. Three specific aims (SA) will be
investigated. SA1 will determine whether Perforin-2+ APC predict Treg subset abundance in sinonasal mucosa
and define the transcriptional landscape of Perforin-2+ APC. SA2 will define the Perforin-2 domains required for
IL-33 release, the diversity of Perforin-2-dependent secreted molecules, and the requisite intracellular trafficking
machinery responsible for Perforin-2 plasma membrane localization during APC-T cell interactions. SA3 will
directly test whether cDC1 and/or cDC2 subsets preferentially use Perforin-2 for driving pathogen-specific T cell
responses in mouse models of respiratory virus or helminth infection. Taken together, this MIST project stands
to uncover a new paradigm for understanding how cDC instruct immunity within the respiratory mucosa."
10908298,"Abstract
 There are stark differences in the burden of certain cancers across racial/ethnic populations. For
example, in comparison to individuals of European ancestry, African American men have a ~67% higher
incidence rate of prostate cancer and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women have a 70% and 95% higher
incidence rate of liver cancer, respectively. These disparities in the burden of cancer across racial/ethnic groups
have been attributed to an interplay of genetic, environmental, and social factors. Despite such disparities, a
majority of genetic research has focused on individuals of European ancestry. While genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have successfully identified >1000 risk loci for cancer, they have focused primarily on individuals
of European ancestry. The inadequate representation of diverse racial/ethnic populations limits the translational
potential of GWAS findings to the world's populations. Applying PRS developed in European ancestry individuals
to other populations may result in biased risk prediction, and further exacerbate health disparities due to
inaccurate assessment of individuals at high risk of disease. Here, we propose to address the drastic need for
appropriate PRS construction and evaluation across multiple race/ethnic groups by applying new PRS
approaches to the following six large-scale, longstanding cohorts: the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC); the Kaiser
Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort; the Women's Health Initiative (WHI);
the Harvard Nurses Health Studies (NHS); the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS); and the
Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Together, these cohorts include over
300,000 individuals (100,000 non-Europeans) and 91,000 incident cancer cases (24,000 non-Europeans). The
individuals in these cohorts are from five racial/ethnic groups: African Americans, Latinos, Japanese, Native
Populations, and European ancestry. While focusing on cancer outcomes, we will utilize these unique and
extensive resources to develop methods to construct and evaluate PRS, and importantly for translation, estimate
absolute and excess relative risk of cancer jointly for PRS and established risk factors in multiethnic populations.
To facilitate access to developed pipelines and data resources, we will follow F.A.I.R. analytic principles while
participating with the Coordinating Center and other study sites. Ultimately, constructing and evaluating risk
models in non-European ancestry populations is essential to broaden the impact of genomic medicine on human
health."
10848216,"Establishment of tendon hierarchical structure is critical to mechanical function. This tightly controlled process
requires coordinated cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. During embryogenesis, tendon progenitors
organize into linear arrays and establish cell-cell communication prior to assembling ECM, suggesting that
cells dictate ECM organization. Cells also clonally expand within linear arrays, suggesting that the ECM also
dictates cell organization. Collagen XII is known to regulate collagen fibril assembly by forming bridges
between fibrils, and our recent data show that collagen XII-deficient tendons exhibit reduced fibril packing and
loss of distinct fiber domains. Interestingly, we also found that these tendons have disordered tenocyte
arrangement and gap junction organization, indicating a novel role for collagen XII in cell organization, cell
communication, and establishing an organized tenocyte network. However, the extent to which disrupted
tendon hierarchical structure due to collagen XII deficiency is driven by disordered cellular arrangement and
communication or by the deposition of disorganized ECM remains unelucidated. Therefore, our overarching
goal is to establish the temporal roles of collagen XII in regulating tendon cell organization, hierarchical
structure, and mechanical function during tendon development and healing. Our global hypothesis is that, in
addition to ECM fibril assembly, collagen XII regulates cellular arrangement and communication prior to ECM
deposition during development and healing, which is pivotal to establishing normal tendon structure-function.
We will use novel tissue-targeted and inducible Col12a1 knockout mouse models to specifically target tendons
during development and healing. These mouse models will be used in conjunction with an innovative
multiscale approach to assess tissue level mechanics, cell organization and communication, fiber alignment,
and fibril size/organization. Aim 1 will define the temporal roles of collagen XII in regulating cell arrangement
and ECM assembly during tendon growth and development. Targeted knockdown of Col12a1 will be induced
throughout tendon development (Scx-Cre driver; Aim 1a) or following establishment of cell organization (Scx-
CreERT2 driver; Aim 1b). Temporal studies will also be conducted using 3D cell-gel constructs to evaluate
tissue formation without confounding variables found in vivo. Aim 2 will define the temporal roles of collagen XII
in regulating cell arrangement and ECM assembly during tendon healing. Using the SMA-CreERT2 driver,
Col12a1 knockdown will be targeted to peritenon-derived progenitors, the primary contributors to healing
tendon following injury. In Aim 2a, SMA-expressing cells will be targeted during the proliferative phase, while
in Aim 2b, SMA-expressing cells will be targeted at the end of the proliferative phase to isolate contributions
to ECM assembly. We will utilize sophisticated and rigorous measures of hierarchical structure/function to
define the interplay between cell and ECM assembly in tendon formation through establishment of temporal
roles for collagen XII in these processes. These innovative studies will provide guidance for future therapies."
10814820,"This CoBRE Phase III application aims to continue support for the Center for Cancer Biology Research
(CCBR) which has established a strong research program within Sanford Research, Sioux Falls, SD. The
original mission of the CCBR was to establish and grow cancer research with a focus on basic and
translational activities. During Phase I CoBRE funding, the CCBR was established with five Project Leaders.
Importantly, critical infrastructure, in the form of Scientific Cores, was developed and a Pilot Grant Program
was initiated. The success of Phase I was marked by attainment of R01 level funding by Project Leaders who
graduated from CoBRE funding and remain successful to this day. In addition, Project Leaders published
important scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals and the Scientific Core functions began expanding as did
their expertise. The power of the Pilot Grant program was demonstrated by scientific publications and obtaining
of funding by awardees. These milestones enabled the awarding of CoBRE Phase II funding for the CCBR.
While the missions of the CCBR remained unchanged, the influx of physician/scientists to the CCBR prompted
an extensive focus on translational cancer research; a theme that remains strongly in place. Phase II Project
Leaders were also successful in obtaining extramural funding and graduated from CoBRE support. Moreover,
the Scientific Cores further expanded their services and began a more systematic approach (SmartSheets) to
order, track and report back services to their users. In addition, fee-for-service schedules were developed for
the Scientific Cores as they prepared for attaining self-sufficiency. The Pilot Grant program continued to
provide funding to investigators who utilized these resources to successfully publish and obtain funding. Phase
III CoBRE funding will enable the CCBR's Scientific Cores to reach a state of self-sustainability while
continuing to offer critical services to CCBR members as well as non-CCBR members of Sanford Research
and investigators from regional and national institutions. A critical component of this Phase III application will
fund the CCBR's Pilot Grant Program. These Pilot Grants have proven to be essential sources of funding for
new investigators and more seasoned faculty that want to test innovative hypotheses or require resources to
generate data necessary to secure extramural funding. Historically, the CCBR's Pilot Grant Awardees have
demonstrated that this funding results in peer-reviewed scientific publications and enables them to obtain
funding from external sources. Moreover, a large percent of Pilot Grant projects utilizes the CCBR's Scientific
Cores thereby contributing to their self-sustainability. The CCBR's successes over the past decade of CoBRE
funding are a testament to the transformative power of this funding mechanism. Obtaining the final Phase of
CoBRE funding will further strengthen the Scientific Cores, translational research, scientific culture of
innovative science and the research infrastructure of the CCBR that began with Phase I CoBRE funding."

The Administrative Core (Core A) of the Center for Cancer Biology Research (CCBR) at Sanford Research is
not only essential for all research activities occurring within the CCBR but also for that within Sanford Research
as a whole. The funds requested in Phase III will provide continued support for the Principal Investigator,
Program Coordinator and Project Manager. These key individuals are responsible for the overall administration
of the CCBR. We also propose to fully support the Lead Research Technician and Senior Research Specialist
of the Histology & Imaging Core (Core B) as well as a Manager and Technician in the Flow Cytometry Core
(Core C). We will additionally support a Pilot Grant program to ensure continued funding of innovative research

Pilot Grant awardees and resolve any issues that may arise within the CCBR or its Scientific Cores. The
Administrative Core will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) To support the existing Scientific Cores,
enabling self-sufficiency and 2) To continue a program of Pilot Grants. In order to achieve these goals, the
Administrative Core will meet twice a year (Fall and Spring) with the Steering and External Advisory Committees.
The Spring meeting will serve as a review of the program and evaluation of the Scientific Cores as they work
towards self-sustainability. Importantly, the Administrative Core will prioritize and oversee the allocation of funds
such that they meet institutional strategic needs and are in line with the NIH mission. Moreover, the
Administrative Core will continue to focus on the CCBR's existing areas of cancer research while expanding to
include additional innovative and impactful areas. The CCBR will have the following focus areas: 1) tumor
innervation, 2) tumor immune response, 3) tumor microenvironment and 4) tumor development. The ultimate
goals of the Administrative Core are to continue funding cancer research in the region and to bring the CCBR's
Scientific Cores to self-sufficiency. The plan laid out in this section will ensure success of the CCBR."
10883563,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 2: Signaling
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is most commonly diagnosed at late stages, at which time the disease
is refractory to most conventional treatment options. Identifying therapeutic strategies that pre-empt the
development of resistance and achieve durable tumor control has been hampered by the enormous complexity
of the paracrine signaling network in PDA. STAT3 is a major node in this resistance network. The Hunter lab has
shown that production of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is a major driver
of STAT3 signaling in tumor cells and promotes chemoresistance. Further, they have shown that LIF and the
related cytokines IL6 and OSM may also play a role in STAT3 signaling in the immune microenvironment (IME).
In Aim 1, the team will investigate the extent to which induction of STAT3 signaling by these cytokines contributes
to tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. High-resolution spatial profiling and single-cell approaches will be
used to delineate the cell type-specific alterations in STAT3 activation using syngeneic orthotopic models of PDA
following treatment with chemotherapy and blockade of LIF, IL6, and/or OSM, which will be corroborated with
the colocalization of cytokines and STAT3 signaling in human patient specimens. As LIF can activate several
pro-survival pathways, the importance of STAT3-dependent and -independent mechanisms to PDA growth and
chemoresistance will be determined. In addition to chemotherapy, the ability of cytokine blockade to potentiate
immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) will be investigated. Further, the team has discovered that aberrant
glycosylation can also modulate the STAT3 pathway. Elevation of the glycan CA19-9 in organoids and in vivo
resulted in increased STAT3 signaling in both the epithelial and stromal compartments. In Aim 2, the mechanism
by which CA19-9 elevation activates STAT3 will be determined and the role of this signaling pathway in
chemoresistance will be dissected in a cell type-specific manner using a novel organoid co-culture platform and
a first of its kind genetically engineered mouse model with pancreas-specific KRAS and TRP53 mutations and
inducible CA19-9 expression. In addition to STAT3, CA19-9 elevation promotes receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling, including activation of the EGFR pathway, which also drives chemoresistance. However, inhibition of
either pathway has yielded limited clinical success. The team’s preliminary studies have revealed correlations
between elevated CA19-9, resistance to chemotherapy, and induction of autophagy, a pathway known to
mediate resistance to both chemotherapeutics and targeted therapies. Therefore, experiments proposed in Aim
3 will systematically dissect how CA19-9 modulation of STAT3, EGFR, and autophagy contribute to therapeutic
resistance. It is important to note that most previous mouse studies on these resistance pathways have been
performed in the absence of CA19-9 and that >90% of PDA patients are CA19-9 positive. Advanced organoid
methodologies will be used to investigate both genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of these pathways,
culminating in in vivo explorations of the efficacies of combination treatment strategies in CA19-9-positive PDA."
10833595,"Project Summary
 Muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells (SC), are a progenitor population required to replenish
muscle damaged by exercise or wasting caused by disease or aging. The ability to generate muscle
progenitors from embryonic stem cells (ESC) would represent a major advance in regenerative medicine.
However, despite recent progress, it remains very challenging to differentiate mouse and human ESC into
muscle progenitors, and SC represent a very small population within muscle tissue. These limitations have
significantly hampered progress toward understanding muscle stem cells, and the critical regulatory processes
that govern SC identity. The transcription factor, Pax7, plays a critical role in establishing SC identity, but given
the limitations associated with obtaining SC, our understanding of its molecular function remains incomplete.
We have taken advantage of a system in which Pax7 expression in ESC generates myogenic precursors able
to repopulate the SC niche, and we have begun investigating the chromatin landscape and epigenetic features
of this population to understand its unique properties. With this system, we have shown that Pax7 can
modulate enhancer function and genome topology. Our goal is to understand how a specific chromatin
environment specifies satellite cell identity using state-of-the-art genomic, biochemical, and proteomic
approaches. In two Aims, we will: (I) investigate how Pax7 re-models the genome, packaging chromatin for
long-range interactions; (II) explore how Pax7 collaborates with other factors to establish gene expression and
genome re-wiring in myogenic precursors in vitro and in vivo. We will inactivate a subset of Pax7-associated
factors, enhancers, and identified regulatory elements and examine their functional impact on genome
architecture, gene expression, cell identity, and differentiation.
 It is known that satellite cells are less efficiently renewed during aging, and given that muscle tumors
(rhabdomyosarcomas) aberrantly express Pax7 fusion proteins to maintain muscle in a pre-differentiated state,
our proposal will shed important light on pathological states resulting from aberrant Pax7 activity and stem cell
function."
10846841,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is little debate that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; drinks with added sugar) lack nutrition, are a
major source of added sugar and calories, and promote obesity and poor cardiometabolic health, especially
when consumed during early childhood. Nearly half of children aged 2-5 drink SSBs on a daily basis, with
heavier consumption in low-income Latino children. After decades of research, it is clear that there is no single
“magic bullet” for solving obesity. What we need are bundled interventions that combine incremental changes
that transform food environments with targeted behavior changes that steer people towards those healthy
options. Childcare centers, which serve 12.5 million children per year, provide an efficient way to intervene
early by engaging childcare providers and parents to make resonant, mutually reinforcing changes in both the
home and childcare environment. Interventions that promote water consumption in place of SSBs have shown
promise for preventing childhood obesity in schoolchildren. Yet, no studies have examined whether
interventions to promote intake of water instead of SSBs in childcare could prevent childhood obesity at an
even earlier stage of development. The proposed cluster-randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of an
intervention called Healthy Drinks, Healthy Futures (Bebidas Saludables, Futuros Saludables) that is culturally
adapted for Latino children and families. Following the Social-Ecological Model and Social Learning Theory,
the intervention supports complementary changes in the childcare and home food environments that promote
water consumption while reducing SSB availability. This is combined with education for childcare providers and
children, and a one-on-one brief motivational counseling intervention with parents to reduce SSB intake and
encourage water consumption in the home. Fourteen childcare centers serving low-income, predominately
Latino children (n=420) will participate in this trial. The primary outcome is child BMI z-score (BMI standard
deviation score). Key secondary outcomes are intake of water and beverage calories at centers and at home.
Outcomes will be captured using anthropometrics (weight, height), plate waste measurements (water and
caloric intake at centers), and Automated Self-Administered 24-hour dietary recalls (water and caloric intake at
home) at baseline, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Surveys of childcare providers and parents will allow us
to explore possible mediators of the intervention effect. We hypothesize that the childcare-based healthy
beverage intervention will increase intake of water and reduce beverage calories consumed at both childcare
and at home. BMI z-score will also improve among children in intervention centers vs. control centers. If shown
to be effective, the Healthy Drinks, Healthy Futures intervention will offer a strategy for intervening early to
prevent obesity for millions of low-income children attending childcare centers. Findings from this study will
contribute to the science of multilevel obesity prevention, and inform the implementation of state, federal, and
local policies to promote healthy beverage intake in childcare centers."
10840881,"By tethering the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, the desmosomal plaque
component desmoplakin (DP) strengthens adhesion mediated by the transmembrane desmosomal cadherins.
DP mutations result in potentially lethal disorders of the skin and heart. The loss of mechanical tissue integrity
caused by desmosome dysfunction is commonly thought to underlie disease pathogenesis. Duing this MERIT
award period, however, we showed that DP is not simply a physical connector. It is also a signaling scaffold that
tunes its own dynamic association with IF as well as the cortical actin cytoskeleton to modulate epithelial cell
mechanics. We identified previously unrecognized binding partners of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in
the DP C-terminus that makes the DP-IF complex tunable. How this DP scaffold changes as keratinocytes transit
from the basal proliferating layer to the superficial layers to meet the needs of the developing tissue is still poorly
understood. Our overarching hypothesis is that DP and associated plakophilins localize and integrate the
activities of signaling mediators and actomyosin modulators when and where they are needed for junction
assembly, adhesion strengthening, and epidermal morphogenesis. Here, we will use a combination of 2- and 3-
dimensional in vitro human models and DP-deficient human disease and animal models to: 1. Define the
mechanism of desmoplakin-intermediate filament complex formation and cooperation with desmosomal
cadherins to modulate adhesion and promote early epidermal morphogenesis. We hypothesize that DP
forms cytoplasmic precursors comprising plakophilins, actin regulators, RNAs, and RNA binding proteins
necessary for junction-associated actin polymerization, altered cell mechanics and cell fate. To test this, we will
define a) the machinery responsible for DP precursor formation, b) the role of the DP IDR as a stress sensor, c)
how DP cooperates with desmosomal cadherins to promote actin remodeling, and d) the role of DP in
stratification; 2. Determine the contribution of the desmoplakin-intermediate filament complex to late
epidermal morphogenesis and the tight junction barrier. We hypothesize that DP recruits Rho Guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and other maturation factors including phosphatases to locally activate
RhoA and strengthen DP-IF interactions, which in turn promotes high cortical tension and tight junction assembly
in superficial layers of the epidermis. To test this we will use genetically or pharmacologically targeted epidermal
cultures, mouse and human disease models of DP dysfunction to: a) evaluate Rho localization/activity, cell
mechanics and TJ structure/function in RhoGEF-deficient or DP mutant conditions with or without local
restoration of tension via optogenetic activation of RhoA, and b) evaluate the role of phosphatases (PP)1/2A and
associated DP post-translational modifications on cell mechanics and TJs. The proposed work will shed light on

 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychological condition that increases the risk of
life-threatening comorbid inflammatory diseases such as hypertension by over 50%. The goal of this project is
to focus specifically on the neurological-T-lymphocyte mechanisms that regulate psychological trauma-induced
inflammation and the predisposition to hypertension. Previous results from our laboratory using a preclinical
model of PTSD known as repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) have demonstrated splenic T-lymphocytes as
a primary source of inflammation after psychological trauma. Furthermore, we identified that RSDS-mice
display a heightened blood pressure response to angiotensin II (AngII), which mimics the cardiovascular
disease sensitization observed in PTSD patients. Importantly, mice lacking T-lymphocytes were not sensitized
to AngII, which implies T-lymphocyte-driven inflammation as a mechanistic regulator of blood pressure after
RSDS. We have additionally elucidated tight links between pro-inflammatory cytokine production from T-
lymphocytes, sympathetic nervous system activation, the mitochondrial redox environment (primarily
superoxide) in T-lymphocytes, anxiety-like behavior, and the development of a blood pressure sensitization to
AngII, which suggests these physiological elements are mechanistically-intertwined. Given this information, we
will test the central hypothesis that increased sympathoexcitation after RSDS drives splenic T-
lymphocyte inflammation through increased mitochondrial superoxide to enhance sensitivity to
hypertension. Our Specific Aims will determine neuroimmune pathways and intracellular mechanisms that
control T-lymphocyte inflammation in the RSDS model of PTSD. The innovation in this proposal lies in the
concept of central and local autonomic control of T-lymphocytes regulating blood pressure sensitization, the
biological identification of mitochondrial superoxide regulating T-lymphocyte inflammation after psychological
trauma, and the technological advances of our new genetically-engineered animal models and
neuromodulation techniques. Overall, this project will reveal the impact of T-lymphocyte inflammation after
psychological trauma, and aims to utilize this evidence to inform clinical management of PTSD via earlier
cardiovascular screening or targeted therapeutic intervention."

The pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is complex and represents one of the most difficult and
pressing challenges facing modern neuroscience. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of
hyperphosphorylated tau and senile plaques consisting of aggregated extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) are the
hallmark pathological features of AD. However, it is clear that other factors likely contribute to the neural
system failure and cognitive impairments associated with AD. Mounting clinical and experimental data suggest
that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors that promote vascular remodeling and dysfunction are
associated with cognitive impairment, and are significant risk factors for the development of AD dementia.
These studies include observations directly linking pathways associated with vascular injury such as
hemostasis, angiogenesis, and hypertension to AD, leading to the hypothesis that CVD risk factors may act via
common mechanisms to promote AD development or progression. For example, current data show that
plaques, tangles, and CVD risk factors all upregulate expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1),
an independent CVD risk factor. Recent studies also suggest that PAI-1 may be a diagnostic biomarker and/or
a risk factor for clinical AD, and PAI-1 expression increases with age, the most significant risk factor for AD
dementia. PAI-1 is best understood for its role regulating fibrinolysis and wound, and in mouse models of AD
PAI-1 deficiency is correlated with improved outcomes. In preliminary data presented here in the 5XFAD
amyloidogenic mouse model we find that significant vascular remodeling occurs concurrently with amyloid
plaque development and cognitive impairment. These changes are associated with reductions in cortical blood
flow and increased PAI-1 expression. RNA-Seq and pathway analysis identify highly significant increases in
gene expression in pathways known to be involved in vascular remodeling in the 5XFAD mice compared to Wt
littermates, including pathways associated with angiogenesis and cardiovascular development. We also find
that pharmacologic inhibition of PAI-1 in 5XFAD mice reduces abnormal vascular remodeling and improves
cognition in the 5XFAD mice, without reducing plaque burden; and importantly that expression of genes within
the vascular remodeling pathways are dramatically reduced in 5XFAD mice receiving the PAI-1 inhibitor.
Based on the current literature and our preliminary data we will test the novel hypothesis that there is a causal
relationship between vascular remodeling, and impaired cognition in the context AD, and that PAI-1 plays a
critical role promoting pathologic vascular remodeling during AD development and progression."

 The goal of this project is to further develop and optimize the next generation arterial spin labeling (ASL)
technologies for quantitative mapping of microvascular perfusion at the level of cortical layers and columns on
the first FDA approved ultrahigh magnetic (UHF) system, the 7T Terra. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
fMRI is the most widely used non-invasive imaging modality for studying the dynamics of macroscopic brain
networks and mesoscopic brain circuits. However, BOLD contrast is susceptible to contaminations of pial veins
on the cortical surface that significantly confounds laminar fMRI. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) or microvascular
perfusion measured by ASL is a key parameter for in vivo assessment of neurovascular function. The ASL
signal is localized close to the site of neural activation and offers the unique capability for quantitative CBF
measurements both at rest and during task activation. We pioneered laminar perfusion imaging using 3D inner-
volume GRASE (Gradient and Spin Echo) ASL at 7T with a spatial resolution of ~1mm3. However, a sub-
millimeter spatial resolution, and ideally at the level of ~0.1mm3 (or ~0.5x0.5x0.5mm3), is required for reliable
differentiation of neural activities across cortical layers and columns, as well as for comparison with the state-
of-the-art BOLD and CBV fMRI. We will take advantage of a few latest technical breakthroughs in our lab: 1)
Cutting-edge ASL pulse sequences with optimized spin labeling strategies for laminar perfusion imaging at 7T;
2) A novel k-t CAIPIRANHA scheme in conjunction with a total-generalized-variation (TGV) regularized
algorithm for robust under-sampling patterns and constrained reconstruction; and 3) A novel denoising
technique termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) invented by our group that is able to reduce the
thermal noise by 50% and double the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of dynamic MRI without significantly affecting
the spatial and temporal resolution. We will then apply the advanced ASL methods to precisely measure
perfusion, arterial transit time (ATT) and T1 of brain tissue across cortical layers during resting state, as well as
to precisely measure task induced perfusion signal changes across cortical layers and columns using
sensorimotor stimulation and working memory tasks. As an exploratory aim, we will further develop an
innovative pulse sequence for concurrent measurements of T2w BOLD, CBF and CBV contrasts at 7T for
mesoscopic imaging of metabolic activities. The developed ASL technologies and research findings will be
highly valuable to both basic and clinical neuroscientific research. We will also evaluate the developed next-
generation ASL pulse sequences and post-processing algorithms at 3T, and disseminate these technologies to
other sites with 3 and/or 7T MR systems to facilitate the widespread adoption of our technologies by the
neuroscientific community."
10813863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromatin structure and organization are critical to establishing developmentally appropriate gene expression
programs for each cell type, and aberrations in these processes lead to developmental abnormalities and
disease. Our research program’s long-term goal is to define how a specialized molecular machine called
condensin can restructure chromosomes to regulate genes in interphase as well as to promote chromosome
segregation in mitosis. Condensin mutations have been reported in patients with microcephaly and various
cancers. Therefore, findings from this project will have direct relevance to human health. Condensin complexes
are conserved from yeast to human, and while their roles in mitosis are relatively well defined, their function in
interphase gene regulation is not well understood. Regulation of X chromosome-wide gene expression in C.
elegans provides us with an opportunity to uncover condensin’s interphase roles. In this organism, in a process
called sex chromosome dosage compensation, a specialized condensin complex binds both X chromosomes
of XX hermaphrodites to downregulate gene expression by half thereby equalizing X-linked gene expression
between the sexes. Condensin-mediated gene repression involves altering X chromosome structure on
multiple levels, including posttranslational modifications of histones, looping of the chromatin fiber,
chromosome compaction, and nuclear organization. The first major project will determine how mutations in
conserved domains affect condensin’s interphase roles compared to its mitotic roles. The effect of the
phosphorylation, which is known to modulate condensin’s activity in mitosis, will also be investigated. The
second project centers on the roles of histone modifiers which cooperate with condensin in the process of
dosage compensation. These histone modifiers perform additional functions in the germline. The project will
characterize the dual functionality of this cellular machinery to reveal how the same activity can be co-opted to
fulfill different biological functions in different tissues. The third project examines how developmental regulators
can coordinate sex chromosome dosage compensation with developmental transitions. Defining the regulation
of key dosage compensation proteins at two key transitions, loss of the pluripotent state and then terminal
differentiation, will reveal the mechanistic link between these processes. Precise genome editing techniques
and tissue and developmental stage-specific protein depletion techniques will be employed to reveal the
mechanism of action and regulation of condensin in gene regulation. State-of-the art microscopy techniques
will be combined with genomic methods and bioinformatics to identify chromosome and chromatin structure
changes that are linked to gene repression."

 The ability to produce spatially and contextually dependent motor responses depends on the nervous
system’s capacity to spatially localize tactile signals. How these computations are accomplished and how the
diversity of neuronal cell-types contribute to network function is not well understood. This project will investigate
how patterns of synaptic connectivity between diverse cell-types in the nervous system contribute to the spatial
localization of tactile stimuli.
 The Tuthill lab is a collaborative and multifaceted team studying proprioception and sensorimotor
processing in Drosophila melanogaster. This project will integrate information from different parts of the
sensorimotor pathway while focusing on neural circuits involved in tactile information processing. Specifically, it
will investigate how tactile sensory information from the leg is represented topographically in the ventral nerve
cord (VNC) of the fly. This will be done by mapping the morphologies and projection patterns of tactile
mechanosensory neurons using spatially selective genetic labeling techniques. Moreover, the fine morphology
and synaptic connectivity patterns of individual sensory neuron axons will be reconstructed using volumetric
electron microscopy image data. To characterize important cell-types in the tactile circuit, interneurons in the
VNC that receive synaptic input from the tactile mechanosensory neurons will also be reconstructed. This will
involve predicting the cell-type identity of these cells based on morphology, synaptic connectivity, and local
shape features, all of which can be derived from large scale electron microscopy. This will shed light on the
diverse neuronal types involved in tactile sensory networks as well as the anatomical features that define such
types. Finally, theoretical modeling techniques will be applied to elucidate how the architecture of tactile circuits
define the spatial representation of tactile sensation and how that may predict the spatial acuity of the fly in
response to stimulation. This involves developing a model that represents tactile mechanosensory neurons from
different areas on the leg and their downstream partners in the VNC. Constrained by the synaptic connectivity,
this model will predict the spatial resolution with which flies can distinguish tactile stimulation on the leg. Overall,
this project will examine how individual connections between neurons contribute to tactile sensory encoding and
elucidate how deficits in the tactile circuit may affect spatial localization."

10814266,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The current half-life of a lung allograft is unacceptably short at just 6.7 years, and all recipients encounter significant
complications, both from allograft rejection and from immunosuppression-associated toxicities. Immune tolerance
provides the ultimate solution to these issues, with the promise of life-long graft acceptance without chronic
immunosuppression, and, or critical importance, with maintenance of protective immunity. While tolerance to kidneys
has been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and humans with transient mixed chimerism, the same protocols
have thus far failed for lungs. Importantly, however, we have recently successfully induced durable (ie stable for the
life of the transplant) mixed-chimerism and tolerance during NHP lung transplantation, representing a major advance.
However, this first success employed non-clinically available agents and conferred a high risk of post- transplant
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). These data suggest that durable chimerism-based lung transplant tolerance is
possible, but that improved strategies are needed, to reset recipient immunity towards tolerance, preserve protective
immunity, and enable rapid clinical translation. To address these goals, Project 2 focuses on 3 areas: 1) Developing
safe, targeted bone marrow conditioning regimens for chimerism-induction; (2) Discovering Treg-supportive
immunomodulation strategies; and (3) Engineering optimal CD4+/FoxP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg)- based cellular
therapies, to enhance and stabilize chimerism-based immune tolerance. We do so through the following two Specific
Aims: Aim 1: CD45-antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC)-based conditioning and targeted immunomodulation: the
new era of mixed-chimerism induction for clinical translation. Aim 1 encompasses 3 Objectives: (1) To test the
hypothesis that a CD45-ADC can successfully create marrow and immune space. (2) To test the hypothesis that Treg-
supportive, tolerogenic immunomodulation, through anti-OX40L, CD137-ADC, or anti- CD154, will successfully induce
durable chimerism across MHC barriers and maintain protective immunity. (3) To test the hypothesis that CD45-ADC-
based chimerism and targeted immune modulation can induce lung allograft tolerance by establishing a Treg-
supportive systemic and intragraft environment. Aim 2: Engineering an optimal Treg cellular therapy to augment
chimerism-based tolerance induction. Aim 2 encompasses 3 Objectives designed to optimize Treg safety/efficacy
for chimerism- and tolerance-induction. (1) To test the hypothesis that OX40L- or CD83-CAR-Tregs will be more
suppressive than unmodified Treg, and will enhance control of inflammatory signaling, inhibit alloreactivity, and
stabilize chimerism. (2) To test the hypothesis that Tregs that are base-edited to enforce FOXP3 expression and be
resistant to calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus, and/or steroids, will be maximally persistent and stable after infusion. (3)
To test the hypothesis that these Tregs will optimize chimerism- based lung allograft tolerance, by reinforcing a Treg-
supportive systemic and intragraft environment. Together, these Aims are designed to develop innovative approaches
for durable chimerism-based lung transplant tolerance."
10842390,"Project Summary / Abstract
In nearly all mammalian cells, a layer of densely compacted heterochromatin resides at the nuclear periphery
while uncompacted, transcriptionally active euchromatin resides in the nuclear interior. This peripheral
heterochromatin is tethered to the nuclear lamina, a filamentous meshwork built by the Lamin proteins.
Approximately one third of the genome is compacted and repressed within lamina-associated domains (LADs)
at the nuclear periphery. LADs maintain the stable repression of gene-poor and repeat-rich regions of the
genome, which is critical for maintaining genome integrity. In addition, many lineage-specific genes are found
within LADs, leading to the model that LADs influence cell fate by restricting expression of irrelevant genes.
Mutations to components of the lamina cause at least 15 distinct “laminopathy” syndromes that are characterized
by abnormal gene expression. In spite of the clear importance of this structure to normal cellular function and its
links to human disease, it remains a mystery how association with the nuclear lamina confers repression. The
objective of my research program is to resolve this mystery by defining how components of the lamina and
chromatin communicate to mediate gene repression. In this proposal, I lay out strategies to define how lamina
protein components tether specific loci, and to determine how these loci are selectively marked for LAD
association by chromatin modification.
The nuclear lamina is a complex assembly of Lamin proteins and lamina-associated inner nuclear membrane
(INM) proteins that varies in composition across cell types. Remarkably, either of two key proteins must be
present at the nuclear lamina to mediate peripheral tethering of heterochromatin in all mammalian cells. These
proteins are the Lamin B receptor (LBR), an INM protein, and Lamin A/C. In addition to the action of these tether
proteins, some signal must specify which genomic loci are destined to be associated with the lamina in order for
LAD formation to be specific and reproducible. Recent work has indicated a strong relationship between LAD
residence and one specific heterochromatin-associated histone modification: dimethylation on histone H3 lysine
9 (H3K9me2). These observations suggest a simple model: that Lamin A/C and LBR recognize and tether
H3K9me2-marked chromatin. However, whether LBR and Lamin A/C can recognize and bind to specific features
of chromatin remains unclear. Separately, we do not understand how H3K9me2 modification comes to be
specifically enriched on LAD-destined chromatin. We will employ structure/function studies along with cellular
chromatin tethering assays and in vitro nucleosome binding assays to define how LBR and Lamin A/C recognize
and tether loci. In parallel, we will define H3K9me2 dynamics in space and time using an acute and reversible
degron approach to interfere with methyltransferase activity. Through these efforts, we will decipher how lamina
and chromatin elements work together to direct gene repression."

Childhood obesity is highly prevalent, difficult to treat and prevent, and of major health and economic
consequence. Lower income children and children of Black, Latinx, and Native American race/ethnicity
experience a disproportionate burden of obesity as compared to higher income and White or Asian children.
Evidence suggests that economic and environmental factors, many driven by structural racism, underlie racial
and income disparities in obesity. These structural factors are often acknowledged as potential root causes of
obesity and obesity disparities; however, they are also recognized as difficult to intervene upon. Policy
interventions are one option for affecting change upon these potential root causes. Using a natural experiment
approach, we have an opportunity to leverage a recent policy change—the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)
of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010—to assess the degree to which providing free meals to all children
in high poverty schools affects obesity prevalence. The CEP was passed in 2010 and allows schools in high-
poverty school districts to provide universal free meals (breakfast and lunch) to all children in the school without
requiring individuals to sign up for the free and reduced lunch program. The goal is to increase participation in
school meals and ultimately reduce both food insecurity and obesity. The program is targeted at lower- and
lower-middle income children, many of whom were not receiving free- and reduced-price lunches despite being
eligible. Because the CEP is targeted to high-poverty schools, focuses on a social determinant (income
constraints) and is a non-agentic policy (i.e. children and their families do not need to do anything extra to receive
the benefits), this policy has high theoretical potential to decrease obesity and possibly decrease obesity
disparities. CEP could be expected to impact child body weight by prompting individuals to substitute healthier
foods for unhealthier food and by providing two meals a day at no cost, thus affecting child BMI through indirect
pathways of increased disposable household income. This increase in disposable income could lead to
decreased food insecurity, decrease parental stress, and/or could potentially be used for health promoting
behaviors, such physical activity or purchasing of healthier foods in the household, each of which has been
associated with obesity. CEP represents a significant change in school policy and an expansion of social safety
nets, but scant scientific literature exists on the health impacts of CEP. The proposed study aims to
comprehensively assess the impacts of CEP on obesity outcomes through using robust data and methods for
causal inference in order to assess: 1) the impact of CEP on obesity 2) impact of CEP on potential mediating
mechanisms 3) heterogeneities in impacts on obesity by race/ethnicity and income 4) impacts on population-
level obesity disparities."
10842300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells hold tremendous scientific and therapeutic potential because they have the capacity to
differentiate into any cell in the adult body. Mounting evidence suggests that differentiation is driven, in part, by
epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications that help to establish and subsequently maintain cell
identity. However, demonstrating a direct role for an individual histone modification is challenging via traditional
mutagenesis approaches because multiple copies of canonical histone genes are present in the mammalian
genome. Moreover, many histone marks are regulated by several, redundant enzymes, which are difficult to
perturb simultaneously and in a physiological context. The long-term goal of our research is to resolve the role
of histone modifications in directing cell fate, both in vivo and in tissue culture systems. Our approach is
innovative because it overcomes current limitations in the field by taking advantage of lysine-to-methionine (K-
to-M) mutations on histone H3, which act as dominant negative inhibitors of methylation at their respective sites.
The objective of this grant is to characterize the function of methylation on H3K9 and H3K36, which change
dramatically during differentiation and development. Our central hypothesis is that H3K9 and H3K36 methylation
have distinct and crucial roles in developmental transitions. To test this hypothesis, we will express mutant
histones, H3K9M and H3K36M, in early embryos and pluripotent stem cells. Specifically, we will track the
maternal to zygotic transition and early lineage decisions following suppression of H3K9 and H3K36 methylation
in embryos (Project 1). We will then apply in vitro cell culture systems to investigate the molecular basis for the
effects of K-to-M mutants on chromatin and gene expression (Project 2). A key feature of our approach is that
expression of the mutant histones is doxycycline-inducible, which permits induction or withdrawal of our histone
mutants in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Using this tool, we will ask whether cells are capable of
reestablishing histone modifications to rescue proper differentiation after mutant histone withdrawal (Project 3).
Collectively, this work is significant because it will provide valuable insight into the functional role of histone
modifications in cell fate change. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control stem cell function is a
crucial step in realizing their tremendous potential. We therefore anticipate that the proposed work will have
important implications for both basic science and medicine."

 Although ART can reduce morbidity and prolong life, it does not cure HIV or fully restore health. Despite
ART, people living with HIV (PWH) continue to have higher average levels of inflammation and immune
activation, which are thought to be a major cause for the higher incidence of diseases in many organ systems
(non-AIDS morbidity) and reduced life expectancy that persist even after years of suppressive ART. While the
causes of immune activation may be multifactorial, it is thought that a major cause is the continued expression
of HIV RNA, protein, and/or virions by subsets of HIV-infected cells. Within the gut, where most infected cells
reside, expression of these viral products likely contributes to dysfunction of the gut mucosal barrier and leakage
of gut microbial products into the circulation, leading to further increases in inflammation and immune activation.
However, it is not clear which viral products contribute to immune activation and the sequelae of treated HIV. To
investigate this question, aim 1 will utilize stored and prospective samples from a cohort of ART-suppressed
PWH to determine the degree to which low-level plasma HIV RNA, levels of different cell-associated HIV
transcripts of varying maturity, and p24 protein expression in blood and gut correlate with the inflammatory
proteome in plasma. It is also unclear what subsets of cells express these viral products, and what factors
determine whether a given infected cell will express HIV. To answer these questions, aim 2 will utilize novel
single cell approaches to characterize the cell phenotypes, chromatin accessibility, transcriptomes, clonotypes,
and surface protein expression of single HIV-infected (HIV DNA+) and HIV-transcribing (HIV RNA+) cells from
the blood and gut of ART-suppressed PWH (aim 2A), and will then test how genes identified through single cell
RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) affect HIV expression (aim 2B). While HIV researchers have identified some drugs that
can inhibit HIV transcription, there is a critical need for new therapies aimed at reducing HIV expression and/or
blocking reactivation from latency. We have identified new drugs that appear to block activation-induced
increases in HIV transcription and virion release. In aim 3, we will compare both published and new drugs for
their ability to enhance baseline blocks to HIV transcription or prevent activation-induced reversal of the blocks
to HIV transcription and splicing in cells from the blood and gut of HIV-infected individuals. The results from
aims 1-3 could lead directly to the identification of new drug targets and new agents aimed at a functional cure
and/or reducing HIV-associated immune activation."
10839449,"RIG-I and MDA5 are key cytosolic receptors for sensing various RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, influenza virus, and flaviviruses. Upon binding of viral RNA, RIG-I-like receptors initiate signal transduction pathways that result in type-I interferon (IFN) induction to suppress viral replication and the spread of infection. For their efficient replication, however, viruses have evolved elegant strategies to evade the IFN-mediated host immune response. Work from many laboratories has identified the precise mechanisms that lead to activation of RIG-I, which include RNA binding, K63-linked ubiquitination, oligomerization, and the re-distribution of RIG-I from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. In striking contrast, our knowledge about the mechanisms that govern activation of the related sensor MDA5 remains elusive. The proposed study builds on a recent discovery by the Gack laboratory that covalent modification of MDA5 by ISG15 activates MDA5 signaling by promoting its CARD-dependent oligomerization and cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation. Molecular and cell biological studies in ISG15-deficient human and mouse cells, including primary immune cells, demonstrated that ISG15 is required for an effective antiviral IFN response mediated by MDA5 (but not RIG-I). Our data also showed that MDA5 ISGylation is required for restricting the infection of SARS-CoV-2, Zika, dengue and picornaviruses. Furthermore, our most recent work revealed that SARS-CoV- 2 uses its papain-like protease (PLpro) to antagonize MDA5 by actively removing its ISGylation. Molecular, biochemical, and cell biological approaches combined with gene-targeting screens will focus on defining in precise detail how ISGylation regulates MDA5-mediated innate immunity, and also identify the E3 ligase that mediates MDA5 ISGylation and thereby its activation. We will also determine the relevance of MDA5 ISGylation for effective virus restriction using MDA5 gene-edited cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and a novel mutant MDA5 knock-in mouse model. This study will also give detailed insight into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses counteract MDA5 ISGylation and determine the physiological role of this novel immune escape strategy in IFN antagonism, virus replication and pathogenesis. Our studies will provide a molecular understanding of the mechanisms that lead to activation of antiviral innate immunity, and also define a novel immune evasion strategy of coronaviruses, which may provide the foundation for new therapeutic approaches or help design better vaccines."

Electronic health record (EHR) and other routinely collected data are often used as cost-effective data sources
for HIV/AIDS research. These data sources, however, are known to be prone to errors, typically across
multiple variables, which can lead to biased study results and misleading conclusions. In addition, EHR data
sources often lack gold-standard measurements that are needed to clearly define the presence or absence of
co-morbidities (e.g., liver fibrosis). To address limitations of EHR data sources, researchers can validate or
collect additional data on a subsample of their patient records. By combining the rich, but error-prone EHR
data on all study subjects with the gold-standard / validated data collected on a subsample of subjects,
researchers can improve study estimates. Specifically, researchers can eliminate the bias of estimates had
they only used the EHR data, and they can improve the precision (e.g., narrower confidence intervals) of study
estimates had they only used the subsample with gold-standard / validated data. In earlier research, we
developed statistical methods and software to combine EHR data with validated sub-samples of data. We
developed optimal, multi-wave designs for targeting records for data validation. Importantly, we applied these
methods to multiple HIV studies using retrospective observational data from the International epidemiology
Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA). However, in our applications, we have encountered additional
challenges that have not yet been addressed. In particular, there is great potential in combining expensive,
prospectively collected, gold-standard data that are sparsely measured (e.g., once per year) on a sub-sample
of patients with EHR data that are collected much more frequently on a larger number of patients. We will
develop methods to handle this setting, and we will develop statistical designs to better select which
participants should be approached for prospective data collection and which patient records should be
validated. We will also develop statistical methods to address other challenges encountered with using EHR
data, including how to incorporate validation data into studies when inclusion in the study is error-prone, and
methods to address more complex types of data (e.g., interval censored data), for which there are a lack of
techniques to handle error-prone data. Our methods and designs will focus on extensions of multiple
imputation, maximum likelihood, and generalized raking techniques. Open source tools and tutorials will be
developed to help researchers to implement these novel methods and study designs. The methods and
designs will be applied to data from the IeDEA network to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for liver
fibrosis/steatosis and frailty among people living with HIV in East Africa and Latin America."

Alexander and Cynthia Boyd and including experts in pharmacoepidemiology, causal inference, clinical
pharmacology and geriatric medicine will support my training in (1) advanced methods in
pharmacoepidemiology; (2) novel techniques in causal inference; and (3) clinical geriatrics. One in four nursing
home residents in the United States has atrial fibrillation and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is projected to
double by 2050 due to the aging of the population. For more than 60 years, warfarin has been the main treatment
used to reduce the risk of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the advent of direct-
acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including both direct Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., apixaban) and direct
thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran), has transformed the treatment landscape. Among nursing home residents
with atrial fibrillation, nearly one-fourth receive DOACs. Although drug-drug interactions involving DOACs are
less numerous than those with warfarin, DOACs have the potential to interact with many drugs that influence
their pharmacokinetics through alterations in cytochrome P450 enzymes or the activity of P-glycoprotein, a drug
transporter. Nursing home residents are at increased risk of such drug-drug interactions because of the
decreased physiologic reserve, polypharmacy, and age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
changes such as decreased renal function. I propose to examine the clinical and health system impact of drug-
drug interactions from DOACs in nursing home residents with atrial fibrillation by (1) determining the prevalence
of drug-drug interactions involving DOACs, and patient, provider and nursing home factors associated with their
occurrences; (2) quantifying the association of drug-drug interactions involving DOACs with major bleeding and
stroke; and (3) evaluating the association of drug-drug interactions involving DOACs with Medicare costs. To do
so, I will use national nursing home data, the “Minimum Data Set,” and linked Medicare Parts A, B and D claims
data. My work will generate novel clinical and economic information regarding drug-drug interactions involving
DOACs to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes in nursing homes. In addition, my training and

Medication nonadherence is common among patients with hypertension and is associated with increased
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, medications adherence is often not addressed in clinical
practice due to a number of factors, including lack of readily available assessment tools and provider
competing demands. Recent uptake of electronic prescribing from the electronic health record (EHR) to
pharmacies offers the opportunity for scalable, real-time measurement of medication adherence that can be
used for interventions at the point of care. In addition, we have demonstrated that an intervention utilizing
medical assistants (MAs) trained as health coaches can improve medication adherence among patients with
hypertension. The objective of this application is to implement a multicomponent intervention that utilizes linked
EHR-pharmacy data and teamlets, consisting of primary care providers (PCPs) and MAs who will receive brief
training in health coaching, to pragmatically address medication adherence in a real-world, primary care
setting. The intervention consists of four components: 1) patients with hypertension will be automatically
screened for low medication adherence using linked EHR–pharmacy data at the time of a PCP encounter; 2)
MAs will deliver a validated, rapid, 12-item survey of common causes of non-adherence; 3) MAs will address
specific barriers to adherence tailored to survey response, including delivery of brief health coaching based on
motivational interviewing; and 4) PCPs will address specific barriers to adherence based on survey response.
The central hypothesis is that this multicomponent intervention will improve medication adherence and blood
pressure for patients with hypertension. We will test this hypothesis in a hybrid type I effectiveness-
implementation pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in 22 diverse primary care clinics. We will also evaluate the
implementation of the intervention, including adoption, acceptability, fidelity, cost-effectiveness, and
sustainability. The project is innovative because it proposes to: 1) measure adherence using pharmacy fill data
available in the EHR for use in real-time clinical interventions; 2) utilize teamlets in which MAs will be given the
tools to assess reasons for non-adherence and deliver tailored health coaching in a pragmatic, scalable way;
and 3) incorporate user centered design principles to maximize incorporation of the intervention into both PCP
and MA workflows. The proposed project is significant because it is expected to provide a scalable
implementation model that utilizes linked EHR-pharmacy fill data, clinical decision support, and teamlets to
improve anti-hypertensive medication adherence. If shown to be successful, this multicomponent, clinic-based
intervention can be scaled to ultimately improve cardiovascular outcomes for millions of patients with
hypertension."

The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to support my short-term
career objective of determining if dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is an early pathological
feature of HD by quantitatively characterizing functional connections between brain regions that regulate the
ANS in children with the gene expansion that causes HD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). I will also
investigate unique physiologic measures of ANS function and early effects on the vascular system in these
participants. ANS dysfunction has been described in adult patients with HD, but it has been thought that this is
a secondary complication of neurodegeneration. However, I recently discovered that children carrying the HD
gene expansion that causes HD (GE children) exhibit symptoms consistent with enhanced sympathetic tone
decades prior to their predicted motor onset. These findings indicate that ANS dysfunction may be one of the
earliest manifestations of neurodegeneration in HD. As a result, the ANS may be a therapeutic target for disease
modification of HD, but more information is required. The ANS is highly regulated by cortical brain regions that
comprise the Central Autonomic Network (CAN), and cortical thinning and atrophy have been well-described in
HD. However, there are no published reports that have objectively characterized the integrity of the functional
connections in the CAN in HD. I will perform resting-state and tasked functional MRI on GE children to
characterize the function of the CAN at different stages of the disease. This experiment will test the specific
hypothesis that quantitative changes in functional integrity of the CAN are apparent decades prior to the predicted
motor onset of HD. Additionally, I will explore physiologic measure of ANS dysfunction including baroreflex
sensitivity (BRS) and how this relates to the function of the vascular system early in the disease course of HD.
Specifically, I will measure aortic stiffness and carotid artery compliance while also measuring cerebral blood
flow using arterial spin labeling to test the hypotheses that relative to healthy control children, GE children will
demonstrate increased aortic stiffness, decreased BRS, and decreased cerebral blood flow. These experiments
will provide vital information regarding when ANS dysfunction occurs in HD, the underlying mechanisms
causing the dysfunction, and if these changes have negative effects on the cardiovascular system early
in the disease course. I have a unique background that positions me well to be a successful translational
scientist. Further training is required in sophisticated neuroimaging methods, neurodevelopment and
neurobiology, as well as biostatistics. The proposed integrated research, world-class mentorship team, and
didactic training programs will ensure my short-term and long-term success. Additionally, the proposed research
and training plans support my long-term career goal to be an independent translational pharmacist studying the
structure and function of the brain in patients with HD to advance therapeutic strategies."
10841553,"ABSTRACT
Type I and III interferons (IFN) restrict RNA virus infection. Infected cells produce IFN through signaling activated
by pattern recognition receptors such as RIG-I. Both RIG-I and downstream signaling must be highly coordinated
for efficient antiviral responses. As such, these processes are regulated by several post-translational
modifications (PTMs). These PTMs are essential for both the activation and eventual termination of RIG-I-
signaling. While RIG-I-signaling is coordinated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation, the mechanisms by which
other PTMs, such as ubiquitin-like modifiers, may regulate RIG-I-signaling are largely unknown. Our preliminary
data reveal that the ubiquitin-like modifier called ufmylation regulates multiple proteins involved in RIG-I signaling
for optimal IFN induction in response to viral infection. Further, our data suggest that ufmylation is utilized by
viruses to evade the host intracellular innate immune response. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to
determine how ufmylation regulates the intracellular innate immune response to virus infection and viral evasion.
Based on our preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that ufmylation modulates the function of host and viral
proteins to regulate antiviral innate immunity and viral evasion. Guided by our preliminary data, this hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Define how UFL1, the ufmylation E3 ligase,
promotes the activation of RIG-I; 2) Understand the molecular mechanism by which ufmylation of a key protein
in the RIG-I signaling pathway downregulates its function and signaling; 3) Determine how dengue virus co-opts
the ufmylation conjugation system for immune evasion. In Aim 1, the molecular mechanisms by which UFL1
induces the activation of RIG-I in response to RNA virus sensing will be defined. In Aim 2, the mechanism and
dynamics of how ufmylation regulates the function of a signaling protein in RIG-I pathway will be determined. In
Aim 3, the function by which ufmylation of a DENV protein promotes DENV immune evasion, both in human cell
lines and in primary cells, will be determined. Taken together, the work proposed in this application will be
significant and innovative because it will attribute a novel immune regulatory function to ufmylation, contribute to
our understanding of its basic functions, and uncover a novel control (ufmylation) of antiviral innate immunity.
Additionally, this work will provide understanding of a host-directed process that is utilized by viruses for immune
evasion to facilitate viral replication. Overall, this work will define a new PTM that coordinates the RIG-I signaling
pathway, which will improve our knowledge of both antiviral immunity and regulation of innate immune pathways
that will lead to increased understanding of the mechanistic causes of dysregulated IFN that can ultimately result
in autoimmune disease. It will also define a new mechanism of immune evasion by flaviviruses that will have
implications for therapeutic and vaccine strategies to limit their infection."

There are over 73,000 adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) in Uganda constituting 4% of the worldwide
population of ALHIV. HIV remains a leading cause of death among adolescents despite widespread availability
of antiretroviral medication. Generally, ALHIV have poor outcomes with higher rates of loss to follow up
compared with other age groups. Mortality rates and loss to follow up are highest during the transition period.
Transition success may be maximized for ALHIV who are better prepared to negotiate care in adult HIV clinic
settings. This preparation can include skills training to improve self-efficacy, resilience, and education to
address lack of HIV knowledge, both of which are predictive of better outcomes following transition. Provision
of psychosocial support and preparatory information to navigate adult HIV care services have also been
associated with successful transition. The overall goal of the proposed K43 application is to complement my
clinical background in psychiatry with advanced coursework and focused mentoring in behavioral science and
development and testing of behavioral interventions to improve transition in care. This training will enable me
to achieve my scientific objective: to develop and test a self-management intervention for ALHIV transitioning
to adult HIV care. This training will enable me to achieve my scientific objective: to develop and test a self-
management intervention for ALHIV. This application proposes to develop a self-management intervention for
ALHIV transitioning to adult HIV care and test the impacts of the intervention on HIV outcomes. Conducting the
proposed studies in this application will complement my prior training in psychiatry while filling key gaps in
three areas: (a) behavioral science theories and their application to behavioral interventions, (b) adaptation and
design of behavioral interventions, and (c) testing of behavioral interventions through randomized trials. To fill
these gaps, I will conduct qualitative research to elaborate a conceptual framework of the barriers faced by
ALHIV transitioning to adult HIV care in Uganda (Aim 1), develop a self-management intervention that will
enable ALHIV to successfully transition to adult HIV care (Aim 2), and assess feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary effects of the self-management intervention on HIV outcomes for ALHIV transitioning to adult HIV
care (Aim 3). This study will be the first to develop a self-management intervention targeting the critical
transition period from pediatric to adult HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa and the first to use a randomized
design to test the effect of a self-management intervention on health outcomes among ALHIV in Uganda who
are transitioning to adult HIV care. These findings will have significant public health impact by optimizing health
outcomes for a key population in the global HIV epidemic. The proposed research will serve as the basis for a
competitive R01 grant proposal, submitted in year 4, to conduct a fully-powered, randomized controlled trial to
evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention to improve retention in care and viral suppression
among ALHIV in Uganda who are navigating the critical period of transition to adult HIV care."
10846588,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Advances in high throughput sequencing have already revealed millions of protein coding variants
within human exomes, and there are many millions of additional differences that likely exist but have not yet
been observed. Many of these variants likely play important roles influencing human health, but we lack the
clinical data required to associate each variant genotype with their corresponding phenotypes. This
disconnect is oftentimes referred to as the variant interpretation problem. Genetic experiments in model
systems play a critical role in uncovering the effects of protein coding variants, but traditional approaches
typically test variants one-by-one and will never address this glut of uncharacterized variants. Multiplex
genetic assays capable of simultaneously testing complex variant libraries have the required throughput, but
these approaches are still in their developmental infancy, and improvements are needed to increase the
capabilities, costs, efficiency, and usability of these techniques to successfully address this problem.
 Harnessing a palette of synthetic biology tools centered around the highly efficient Bxb1
bacteriophage DNA recombinase, I developed a user-friendly, highly customizable platform for expression of
complex variant libraries within individual cultured human cells. I previously paired this expression system
with a highly generalizable assay that identifies variants that are loss-of-function due to an reduced
intracellular steady-state abundance. I applied this assay to comprehensively study variants in four disease-
related proteins, and more collaborative projects are still in progress. Unfortunately, these methods alone will
not address the problem, and more orthogonal approaches are needed to tackle the millions of
uncharacterized disease-relevant variants that exist within people.
 The goal of this proposal is to build the next set of fundamental biotechnologies needed to enable
more high-throughput characterizations of protein variants. The individual directions described are each
highly generalizable and can be reapplied to study large swaths of the proteome with only slight
modification. Immediate directions include a functional complementation system to study essential genes, a
fluorescent transcriptional reporter system to study perturbations to intracellular signaling pathways, and a
barcoded ORFeome collection to identify genes that modulate phenotypes of interest when they are
overexpressed. A major purpose of these technologies is to facilitate adoption by other research groups,
especially those that are experts in other biological fields. These developments, along with the data we
generate in the process of demonstrating their utility, will directly address the variant interpretation problem
while also uncovering previously hidden biology underlying cancer-related molecular mechanisms critical to
cell function."

 Mosquitoes transmit numerous human pathogens, such as dengue virus and Plasmodium falciparum,
collectively responsible for at least one million deaths each year. In addition to rising insecticide resistance and
other factors, it has become increasingly evident that current strategies to control mosquito populations are being
confounded by the resilience conferred by mosquitoes’ high levels of behavioral and physiological plasticity. In
particular, biological rhythms are crucial to disease transmission as they allow mosquitoes to be active and
responsive to host cues at times of the day when hosts are available. However, despite clear epidemiological
relevance, we know very little about the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the chronobiology and
the olfactory behavior of mosquitoes. To address this key knowledge gap, we have developed an integrative and
multidisciplinary approach that will provide innovative critical steps towards elucidating the neural and molecular
rules of sensory processing that guide mosquitoes’ olfactory rhythms. We propose here to use this strategy for
analyzing the mechanistic underpinnings of the interaction between daily rhythms, olfactory detection and
processing, and olfactory-mediated behaviors in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
 We will first determine how rhythms in olfactory sensitivity and in olfactory encoding at the level of the
antennal lobe contribute to rhythms in the behavioral responses to host-related volatiles. In a second aim, we
will further analyze how circadian clocks modulate the brain and antennal transcriptome of mosquitoes, and
generate the first line of arrhythmic mosquitoes, by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout clock gene expression.
Finally, we will combine behavioral methods and transcriptomic analysis (single-cell RNA sequencing) to identify
the cell-types responsible for the synchronization of mosquito behavior with host-availability. This third aim will
further provide a large-scale characterization of the rhythmic regulation of mosquito brain activity, and define
rhythms in cell regulatory states.
 Upon completion, these aims will shed light on the neural and molecular processes by which olfactory
behaviors vary daily in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Not only the proposed work is expected to offer new mechanistic
insights into the biological rhythms of mosquitoes and generate a first clock knockout mosquito line, but it also
bears strong potential for revealing new targets and methods for disrupting mosquito-host interactions and inform
an integrated vector management strategy that can counteract mosquito behavioral plasticity."

This is an R35 NIGMS application that is meant to succeed R37GM62437 and concerns the development and
application of chemical approaches to enhance our understanding of histone post-translational modifications
(PTMs) on Lys residues and the enzymes that attach and remove them (“writers” and “erasers”). Our lab has a
record of technical innovation in the chemical biology of histone modifications including bivalent analog design
and protein semisynthesis. Our bivalent compound approaches have led to the generation of potent and
selective inhibitors of p300 and CBP (p300/CBP) acetyltransferases and the LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST (LHC)
demethylase/ deacetylase gene silencing complex. Our latest-generation compounds, A485 for p300/CBP and
corin for LHC have become very useful and popular pharmacological probes for analyzing these histone-
modifying enzymes in mechanistic and preclinical therapeutic experiments. Our protein semisynthetic methods
including expressed protein ligation, engineered sortase-catalyzed histone production, and Cys modification to
introduce acyl-Lys mimics have proven to be efficient approaches to furnish site-specifically modified proteins.
In recent years we have shown how particular histone modifications influence nucleosome stability and
susceptibility to eraser enzymes including deacetylase, demethylase, and deubiquitinase isoforms. Notably, we
have discovered a new case of histone mark (PTM) crosstalk—an apparent gatekeeper function for histone H3
acetylation at Lys14 in blocking LSD1 demethylation of H3 methyl-Lys4. In the next phase of our research
program, we will develop and apply new chemical methods to more broadly understand the biology of histone
mark crosstalk using protein semisynthesis, gene editing, structural approaches, and “cut and paste” mass
spec proteomics. We will explore structural and functional features of enzymatic nucleosome interactions in the
context of LSD1, PRC1, SAGA, HDAC1, and Sirt6 complexes in part by incorporating chemical warheads into
designer nucleosomes. In addition, we will apply a newly engineered version of sortase to isolate histone H3
tails from cellular chromatin to quantitatively readout patterns of PTMs in different cell types and in response to
pharmacological agents by employing tandem mass tag mass spectrometry. Upon completion of this research
effort, our findings will broaden the knowledge of how histone Lys modifications are “written” and “erased” and
how specific PTM patterns regulate gene expression and cell fate. Moreover, these studies should pave the
way for new therapeutic strategies to combat epigenetic dysregulation in various diseases. This research
program will also enable the training of the next generation of biochemical investigators interested in protein
science and guided by a commitment to diversity and inclusion."
10845487,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time-
consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an
alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure
Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively
determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups
world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories,
including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued
development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants;
solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive
numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center
also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies
on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center
coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.
 Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where
homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches,
particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in
a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other
opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the
still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the
machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models
has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more
accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy,
and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the
broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2
protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means."

Organic synthesis is a rate-limiting factor in drug discovery, and consequently, advances in synthetic methods
relevant to bioactive molecule preparation can be a powerful driving force to accelerate the discovery of new
small molecule therapeutics for unmet medical needs. Research in the Hilinski laboratory is focused on
addressing unsolved challenges in catalysis and synthesis that have immediate relevance to the contemporary
practice of drug discovery, and that have the potential for broad impact as widespread platforms for new reaction
discovery and/or synthetic planning. We are also invested in the direct application of small molecule synthesis
to drug discovery, in collaborative projects that use small molecules to engage new biological targets for cancer
treatment. This MIRA application outlines our recent endeavors and future plans in two areas: (1) catalytic,
selective C–H functionalization, and (2) novel cycloaddition reactions. In the first area, research in the field of
intermolecular, site selective C(sp3)–H hydroxylation and amination has advanced considerably in recent years,
but has reached a major barrier in the desire to transition from substrate-controlled selectivity to catalyst
controlled selectivity. To address these and other challenges, we have established a program in organocatalytic
atom-transfer C–H functionalization and over the past several years have shown that our catalytic platform,
focused on iminium salt and amine catalysts, competes with or exceeds metal-catalyzed methods in reactivity
and selectivity, and also that it has the flexibility to enable multiple types of atom transfer (i.e. both hydroxylation
and amination). Having established this foundation, we are now beginning to better understand the unique
mechanistic details of these reactions and the influence of catalyst structure on reactivity and selectivity. Our
goals over the next five years are to use amine catalysis to override substrate control of C–H hydroxylation site
selectivity and to develop enantioselective C–H hydroxylation methods, and to use iminium catalysis to expand
both the scope and selectivity among benzylic, unactivated tertiary, and unactivated secondary C–H bonds in
late-stage C–H amination applications. Distinct from our research on C–H functionalization, we have also
established a program on the invention of new regioselective and stereoselective cycloaddition reactions
targeting nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbocycles appended to nitrogen-containing heterocycles, two
major structural motifs in drug discovery. Described in this application is our recent discovery of Lewis acid
catalysis of a virtually unexplored variant of the Diels-Alder reaction – one that uses vinylazaarenes as
dienophiles. Over the next five years, we intend to pursue our long-term goal of establishing this as a strategy-
level synthetic approach by expanding this chemistry to include hetero Diels-Alder reactions to form azaarene-
appended aliphatic nitrogen heterocycles, and by developing enantioselective variants. The results of these
future research plans will enable an expansion of the chemical space that can be explored for drug discovery."
10839452,"The ability to listen and identify sounds in the presence of competing background noise is a critical
function of the healthy auditory system. Humans with normal hearing can easily carry a conversation even
with relatively high levels of noise and in complex auditory environments, such as a busy restaurant. Yet,
for individuals with hearing loss even moderate levels of background noise can adversely impact sound
recognition. Understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie recognition in noise is thus of high
clinically relevance.
This project provides a novel approach to study how the healthy auditory system utilizes statistical
sound cues during real-world sound recognition in the presence of competing natural background sounds.
Using human participants listening to natural sound mixtures and synthetically modified variants, Aim 1
explores how several sound texture statistics influence the perception of speech in real-world noise. Aim 2
tests the hypothesis that the same statistical sound cues modulate neural activity in auditory midbrain and
that these statistics influence, beneficially or detrimentally, the neural representation of a foreground
sounds in natural noises. Neural decoders will then assess how the neural activity contributes towards
recognition under various natural noises with distinct statistics. Finally, in Aim 3, a model that captures
peripheral and central auditory system transformations will be used to mechanistically predict neural
activity, neural decoding performance, and human recognition, under adverse natural masking conditions.
We hypothesize that, by capturing the fundamental transformations of the central auditory system, we will
be able to predict neural-based recognition and human perceptual trends.
The study will lay a foundation for developing a general theory of how the auditory system utilizes
high-order statistical structure for natural, realistic sound recognition in background environmental noise.
The results will extend previous work on auditory masking by quantify the influence of high-order cues on
perception, will provide detailed descriptions of how statistical cues drive non-classical neural responses,
and will define models that can account for both physiology and behavior. The findings, models, and
optimal quality metrics that will be developed have health related implications that can potentially improve
human communication outcomes, with likely applications for hearing diagnosis and developing biologically
inspired noise suppression strategies for auditory prosthetics."
10854739,"Abstract Synaptic failure is an important feature of HIV infection of the brain, and a likely key contributor to HIV-
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Yet current animal models have proven of limited utility in defining
the mechanisms of this process, in part because of the species-specific nature of HIV infection, but also because
of the greater complexity of human astrocytes relative to those of mice. To address this issue, we will utilize mice
chimeric for both human microglia and human astrocytes, to assess the effects of HIV infection on central
neurons. To that end, we will engraft mice with both human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) and microglia, each
derived from embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have established the methods of generating these human glial
chimeras, by the neonatal implantation of hGPCs, which outcompete and ultimately replace the host mouse
GPCs, yielding adult chimeras broadly colonized with human astroglia1-5. This process is especially robust in the
neostriatum, allowing the glial humanization of regions critically involved in striatal reward and addiction circuits.
We have recently extended this approach to include chimerization with hESC-derived microglia, paired with the
use of CSF1R null mice lacking host microglia, crossed to NSG SGM3 mice to allow the stable xenograft of
hGPCs. The mice are thus chimeric for hGPC-derived astrocytes as well as microglia, in a T- and B-cell deficient
background that allows the effects of glial HIV infection on neurons to be isolated, following intracerebral
inoculation with HIV-infected microglia. These chimeric human astroglial-microglial (CHAM) mice are especially
attractive, since they incorporate the hominid-specific features of human astroglia, which are themselves key
components of central synapses. Using this model, we will test the postulate that astrocytes become both
structurally and functionally impaired by microglial HIV infection, resulting in the loss of synaptic engagement by
affected astrocytes, with consequent dendritic involution and network disruption. By infecting CHAM mice with
HIV, and using rabies viral-EGFP to trace striatal dendrites, we will assess the effects of astrocytic HIV infection
on the dendritic architecture and synaptic structure of resident medium spiny neurons. In parallel, we will study
the effects in CHAM mice of HIV infection complicated by methamphetamine use – a common and disabling
comorbidity that suppresses dopaminergic input to the striatum – focusing on the structural and transcriptional
responses of human glia to the combination of infection and addiction, as well as on the behavioral effects of
that combination. To that end, we will use single cell RNA-Seq to assess the changes in gene expression by
human astrocytes and their partnered mouse neurons caused by HIV infection, both alone and together with
chronic methamphetamine use, to identify those changes that contribute to the striatal synaptic disruption and
behavioral pathology of these mice. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that the HIV-infected striatum, by virtue of
astrocytic fiber disengagement from dopaminergic synapses in particular, is especially vulnerable to the effects
of amphetamine abuse, while defining the transcriptional basis for the glial pathology underlying that vulnerability."
10842260,"Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are conspicuous neural extracellular matrix (ECM) structures that have garnered
significant interest over the last decade for the critical roles they play in neural developmental plasticity. These
complex macromolecular structures are implicated in an array of cognitive functions, and are altered in a variety
of neurological disorders. Despite the growing interest in PNN functions, the mechanisms by which they
modulate neural functions are poorly understood, because there are currently no tools or techniques to
manipulate PNNs specifically. We surmise that our inability to target and disrupt PNNs is primarily driven by a
lack of understanding of their molecular composition or structure. Our goal in this proposal is to conduct a
structure-function analysis of known PNN components as well as to identify proteins that anchor nets to neuronal
surfaces. Using a powerful combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have obtained strong preliminary
data detailing how the newly identified PNN component receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTPζ)
associates with tenascin-R (TNR) within PNNs at a molecular level. Furthermore, our data indicate that the
RPTPζ•TNR complex anchors PNNs to the neuronal cell surface via the GPI-linked protein contactin-1 (CNTN1),
which makes CNTN1 the first surface binding protein for PNNs ever identified. Our central hypothesis is that
there are a set of unique components and receptors of PNNs that nucleate PNNs and anchor them to specific
neuronal cell surfaces, thereby defining their unique structure and functions. The overall objective of this proposal
is to identify PNN-specific components and dissect the formation of PNNs through a unique combination of
proximity-labeling assays, protein-binding assays, and protein X-ray crystallography in order to create the tools
to target and manipulate these structures specifically and precisely. Our long-term goal is then to use these tools
to dissect PNN function in order to better understand disease pathogenesis and ultimately to target PNNs
therapeutically. Guided by our strong preliminary data, this proposal seeks to discover the unique components
that guide the assembly of PNNs by pursuing three non-overlapping specific aims: 1) defining the role of the
RPTPζ•TNR complex in anchoring PNNs to neuronal surfaces; 2) pursuing the biochemical and structural
characterization of interactions between ACAN, HAPLN1, and TNR; and 3) identifying cell surface receptors and
novel components of PNNs. The proposed work is significant because it will attempt to identify the key unique
components that contribute to the formation and thereby function of PNNs. Successful completion of the aims
will provide key insights and reagents to manipulate PNNs specifically and precisely and ultimately understand
their functional mechanisms. This approach is innovative because it brings together a novel combination of
physiological, biochemical and structural approaches to investigate these important macromolecular assemblies
in the central nervous system. Ultimately, the proposed work could be transformative for the field and lead to key
mechanistic insights into of PNN function in health and disease."

recruitment of additional faculty across our broad neuroscience base; the development of new opportunities for
students to gain teaching experience; changes to the neuroscience curriculum in response to recent advances
in the field and the changing needs of our students; using individual development plans to ensure strong
mentoring of all students; and the creation of an Alumni Seminar Series which further advances our goal of
providing trainees ample opportunity to understand the diversity of neuroscience career options available to

efforts to discover mechanisms underlying pathology of the nervous system and to develop new strategies to
treat or prevent neurological disease."

Deciphering how natural genetic variations influence complex phenotypic traits is a central goal in human
genetics and evolutionary biology. Over the past decades, empirical studies in model systems have conceptually
advanced the genetic understanding of natural variations in physiological and morphological traits. In contrast,
how natural behavioral variations arise from genetic changes altering neural functions remains a fundamental
mystery. Although numerous correlations between genetic variations and behavioral variations have been
identified across a wide range of species including human, the identity and functional nature of casual genetic
changes are largely out of reach. The evolution of courtship song in closely related Drosophila species provides
a rare opportunity to establish such causal links, by offering extraordinary behavioral diversity and unparalleled
genetic, neuronal and behavioral tractability. The overarching goal of this proposal is to leverage this powerful
system and employ our innovative platforms to identify causal genetic and molecular changes that mediate the
evolution of the nervous system and behaviors. Our research will proceed in two independent but complementary
directions. First, by combining a targeted genetic mapping approach and automated behavioral quantification
with unprecedented throughput, we will perform a gene-resolution dissection of defined trait-associated genomic
regions to delineate the causal genes and mutations underlying a species-specific courtship song trait. Second,
building on our knowledge of relevant neurons in courtship song evolution and our expertise in genetically
labeling these neurons across species, we will exploit possible neural sites of adaptive changes as an entry and
use single-cell transcriptomes to probe gene expression changes, especially cis-regulatory changes, that are
responsible for species-specific neural functions and behaviors. Importantly, for each direction, we will examine
the phenotypic effects of candidate genetic and molecular changes using integrative approaches such as
definitive genetic tests and neuron-specific gene silencing. The two directions are synergistic in connecting the
dots between evolutionary changes at different levels of biological organization. This study will lead to a rich
understanding of how evolution operates on the genes and the nervous system to yield adaptive behavioral
traits, which will allow us to derive principal mechanisms generalizable across species, and in turn, inform the
etiological conditions of behavioral disorders and mental disease in human."
10843943,"Globally, undernutrition contributes to 44% of childhood deaths under the age of five 1. Stunting, or reduced linear growth, is a major complication of undernutrition that is associated with increased risk of metabolic and infectious disease, reduced educational attainment and poor cognitive function later in life 3. Stunted mothers are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, and to give birth to stunted children 5. In turn, many children that are born stunted do not recover despite current therapeutic interventions 4. Therefore, stunting is often referred to as an intergenerational syndrome, and new approaches are desperately needed to improve childhood growth in vulnerable populations. The maternal immune system plays a major role in shaping offspring physical, cognitive and immune development. The gut microbiota likewise influences both local and systemic immunity, raising the possibility that the maternal microbiome could influence fetal and childhood development. We hypothesize that maternal gut microbial composition shapes the fetal immune environment to control offspring growth and immune development during undernutrition. We propose to use a mouse model of intergenerational undernutrition to identify specific immune and microbial targets for therapeutic intervention. Our preliminary data demonstrate that breeding mice colonized with microbiota from healthy or severely stunted donors produce offspring with divergent weight, bone, and immune developmental phenotypes that persist into maturity. We will use this model to isolate the role of the maternal gut microbiome from the neonatal microbiome, giving critical insight into the window of potential intervention. We will also identify specific subsets of microbes that are capable of influencing offspring growth and immune development and characterize microbial metabolic products associated with these changes. Finally, we will identify maternal immune cells and signaling pathways that respond to these microbial communities to control healthy growth and immune development in offspring. These experiments will identify specific microbial species as well as host immune pathways to target therapeutically and define the appropriate developmental stage in which to intervene. The Cowardin lab is located within the Child Health Research Center at the University of Virginia, and as a member of the Trans- University Miocrobiome Initiative, is uniquely suited to pursuing these studies. The lab has both the infrastructure and expertise required for successful completion of these goals. Ultimately, this proposal will lead to potential probiotic and immunotherapeutic treatments to disrupt the transmission of stunting from mother to child."

The identification of intracranial hypertension (ICH) is essential during pediatric neurological and neurosurgical
evaluation. If untreated, it may lead to brain injury, developmental delay or even death. However, current non-
invasive evaluation of ICH is based on clinical symptoms that have poor correlation with it, and imaging
findings are highly variable and subjective. Hence, non-invasive evaluation of ICH is challenging and often
inconclusive. Additionally, invasive intracranial pressure monitors can help identify ICH but they are usually
avoided because they often offer inconclusive results and carry important risks of hemorrhage and infections.
Consequently, ICH remains underdiagnosed in the population. In this project, we aim to create non-invasive
methods to automatically identify the presence of ICH in pediatric patients using CT images of the head.
The main hypothesis of this project is that an elevated intracranial pressure results into a decrease of bone
mineralization, which can be quantified from CT images. This hypothesis is supported by clinical reports of
patients with elevated pressure or brain growth constraints showing thinner and less dense cranial bones, and
of patient with intracranial hypotension presenting an abnormally thick cranial bone.
During this project, we will: (1) create a sex- and age-specific normative statistical model of cranial bone
thickness and density between birth and 10 years using a large retrospective CT image dataset of subjects
without cranial pathology; (2) quantify bone abnormalities in patients with ICH and create machine learning
models to identify them using a retrospective dataset of patients who required surgical treatment for pressure
release; and (3) perform a pilot study to identify and quantify local signs of elevated pressure in patients with
cranial growth constraints caused by craniosynostosis. Upon completion of this project, we will have
established normative references of cranial bone mineralization, identified and quantified bone mineralization
changes associated with ICH, and created automatic tools to identify them. In addition, if our exploratory study
in patients with craniosynostosis succeeds, it will prompt a larger clinical study of the presence of ICH in these
patients that could translate in a substantial improvement of their clinical management through timely
interventions, especially in older children and relapsing patients."

Congenital CMV (cCMV) is a leading cause of hearing loss and cognitive impairment in surviving newborns. A
vaccine is a high priority but an effective vaccine needs to exceed protection levels of natural convalescent
immunity because of the risk of re-infection by multiple strains of HCMV. The guinea pig is the only small
animal model for cCMV with disease in pups similar to humans. Previously it was demonstrated that guinea pig
cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) encodes functionally similar essential viral glycoprotein complexes to HCMV, which
can act as neutralizing antibody target antigens. An important correlation with HCMV is that GPCMV encodes
a functional gH based pentamer complex (PC) necessary for virus tropism/entry to non-fibroblast cells,
pathogenesis and cCMV. Previously, the efficacy of two non-replication competent capsid mutant GPCMV
DISC (Defective Infectious Single Cycle) vaccine strains were evaluated: (1) lacking PC (DISCI); (2) encoding
PC (DISCII). DISCII was more successful in neutralizing virus on epithelial cells and fully protected against
cCMV when pregnant animals were challenged with wild type virus. However, a significant challenge that
remains to be attained is the ability of a DISC vaccine strategy to protect against: (1) multistrain virus
challenge, which is an absolute necessity for a successful HCMV vaccine; (2) provide protection against
natural routes of infection. A newly isolated GPCMV strain (CRV) will be included in the studies to enable
multistrain virus challenge. Modified GPCMV DISC vaccine strain will be improved for immunogenicity and
correlates of immune protection determined. An important leap in the guinea pig model studies is that we will
employ the first gene knockout (IFNLR1) guinea pig to evaluate the importance of IFN III in shaping immune
response. The overall central hypothesis is that the DISC vaccine strategy can provide greater protection
against cCMV compared to convalescent immunity and can fully protect against multiple strains of virus and
natural routes of infection but vaccine requires comprehensive CMV gene expression that is potentially lacking
in IE1 mutant based DISC vaccine strains. The proposed studies will provide an accelerated timeline for the
realistic evaluation of a DISC vaccine strategy against cCMV."

This Project focuses on the mechanisms responsible for mast cell (MC) hyperplasia, heterogeneity, and
activation that are characteristic of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), especially in aspirin
exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Studies in the current iteration of this AADCRC suggest that
canonical mast cell subtypes expressing tryptase and chymase (MCTC) or tryptase alone (MCT) emerge from a
novel CD117hiCD38hi transitional MC population that is enriched for markers of proliferation and activation.
New data suggest that fibroblast-derived factors drive the emergence of this proliferating MC population from
circulating MC progenitors (MCp), and that stromal cells conspire with cytokines (particularly IL-4Rα-active
cytokines and IL-33) to drive different MC effector functions in correspondingly different anatomic
compartments of the sinonasal mucosa. An unsupervised network analysis combined with functional studies in
a novel 3-dimensional culture system reveals a likely feed-forward system between MC-derived LIF and
fibroblast-derived IL-6 that may promote MC expansion and activation, and is greatly facilitated by IL-4Rα
signaling at both MCs and fibroblasts. This Project combines hypothesis-testing and unbiased approaches to
understand the developmental origins of MCs, the functional control of MC expansion and activation in T2I,
and the mechanisms by which MCs in turn influence stromal cell function in this context. The long-term overall
goals are to precisely identify the cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors most responsible for driving MC
hyperplasia and influencing their effector function in respiratory T2I, to understand the local consequences of
MC hyperplasia in tissue function, and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Aim 1 will map the molecular
transitions between circulating MCp and their putative tissue descendants and determine the developmental
origins of proliferation-enriched transitional MCs. Aim 2 will identify the mechanisms by which fibroblasts and
EpCs facilitate the development of subepithelial MCTC and transitional MCs and potentiate their activation in
the setting of T2I. Aim 3 will determine the role of stromal cell-amplified MC-derived mediators, including LIF,
in driving MC-stromal cell interactions in T2I. The project is integral to the overall goals of the AADCRC, and
involves substantial interactions with the other two Projects."

Basal epithelial cells are the stem-like progenitor cells that give rise to all differentiated epithelial cell subsets.
In addition to their progenitor function, they produce pro-inflammatory molecules including interleukin-33 (IL-
33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), implicated in the pathobiology of type 2 (T2) inflammatory
diseases such as eczema, food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, asthma, and nasal polyposis. Our group
recently reported that basal cells from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) are
dysplastic, fail to differentiate into normal respiratory epithelial cells, and upregulate the capacity to generate
proinflammatory molecules. These abnormalities are associated with an aberrant metabolic program. The goal
of this research plan is to: 1) define how basal cell metabolism regulates their stem and proinflammatory
functions, 2) determine how basal cell metabolism is altered in the sinonasal tissue of patients with different
types of chronic rhinosinusitis, and 3) determine whether therapeutic inhibition of IL-4Rα will restore the

10840922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory syndrome that affects 14% of
adults with severe asthma, and 30% of adults with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
(CRSwNP). Patients with AERD develop recurrent nasal polyps that cause nasal blockage, sinus pain, and
complete loss of sense of smell. Neither the initial cause nor the driver of ongoing inflammation and polyp
regrowth are known, and there are few effective therapies. Newly developed biologic anti-type 2 cytokine
therapies are a significant treatment advance, but the roles of IL-4Rα and IL-33/ST2 signaling in driving the
chronic respiratory inflammation that plagues patients with asthma, CRSwNP, and AERD are not known.
 Our preliminary data show that AERD pathophysiology involves persistently abnormal functions of both
mast cells and epithelial cells within the nasal polyp tissue, which contributes to disease persistence,
recurrence and severity. The dysregulation of these cells is tightly linked and potentially regulated by IL-4Rα
and IL-33 signaling. This Project will determine the cell-specific roles of IL-4Rα and IL-33/ST2 signaling in
driving the chronic respiratory inflammation that plagues patients with AERD and nasal polyposis. Using a
double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-design trial of dupilumab, a potent IL-4Rα antagonist, and
REGN3500, a potent IL-33 inhibitor, we will test the central hypotheses that (1) the rapid onset of clinical
improvement provided by IL-4Rα inhibition with dupilumab in AERD is due largely to the drug’s direct effects
on both MCs and EpCs; and (2) REGN3500 will rapidly and directly suppress MC activation, but will not effect
EpCs until it inhibits IL-13 production, and therefore will have a more delayed onset for full clinical
effectiveness. Aim 1 will determin the efficacy of dupilumab and REGN3500 as treatments for AERD. Aim 2
will determine the relevance of IL-4Rα and IL-33/ST2 signaling on on mast cell activation, epithelial cell
dysfunction, and the respiratory inflammation in AERD. To address our hypotheses, we propose the following
Aims:
Aim 1. Compare the clinical efficacy of anti-IL-4α (dupilumab) and anti-IL-33 (REGN3500) as treatments for
nasal polyps in AERD in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
Aim 2. Define the mechanism(s) of anti-IL-4Rα and anti-IL-33-induced therapeutic benefit in AERD by linking
early and later changes in mediator and effector cell readouts to clinical efficacy."

With the rapid progress in cancer biology, there is a great need to train academic surgical oncologists who can
not only deliver state-of-the art surgical care, but can also lead multidisciplinary teams and research programs
leveraging molecular oncology, immunology, and other emerging fields. To address the national shortage of
surgical investigators focused on surgical oncology, the Department of Surgical Oncology at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has dedicated its T32 training program to producing academic surgical
oncologists. The long-term objective is to train surgical residents and surgical oncology fellows in the essential
research skills necessary to be productive independent surgical investigators in clinical, translational, and
laboratory-based oncology research and to become leaders in oncology. Moreover, we are committed to
providing T32 training to groups that are underrepresented in academic surgical oncology, including minorities
and women. Training is offered to eight postdoctoral MD or MD PhD fellows either during a 24-month hiatus from
general surgery residency training (`research fellows') or during a three-year combined clinical/research
fellowship in surgical oncology (`clinical/research fellows') that begins after general surgery residency. Our T32
training program has been highly successful in achieving its goals and is now entering its 35th year. Upon
completion of residency, most of our T32 research fellows either started fellowship training, or accepted
academic surgical positions. Upon completion of surgical oncology fellowship training, 100% of our T32
clinical/research fellows entered academic Surgical Oncology positions. Our T32 program provides research
opportunities in a broad range of basic oncologic disciplines, in one of three training tracks; (a) basic and
translational research, (b) quality, clinical effectiveness and outcomes, and (c) clinical trials and biomarkers. This
academic training program allows us to train surgeons with a diverse set of unique skills, increasing the likelihood
of trainees obtaining an academic position upon completion of training. Training in biostatistics, responsible
conduct of research, reproducibility, and a rich array of seminars and graduate courses available are integral to
the T32 program. The T32 program faculty includes a multidisciplinary faculty pool, including established surgical
investigators, junior faculty, department chairs, medical and radiation oncologists as well as basic-science
researchers, all of whom have peer-reviewed grant support. MD Anderson is a leading NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center that provides trainees access to unique resources and our location in the Texas
Medical Center provides our trainees potential collaborators at six academic institutions. Thus, the University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is a highly stimulating environment for future leaders in academic surgical
oncology."

The purpose of the proposed program is to train the next generation of scholars in developmental
psychopathology who will conduct multiple levels of analysis research addressing one or more of
NIMH’s 2020 strategic objectives. The proposal requests continuation of a training program at the
Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, continuously supported by the National
Institute of Mental Health since 1959. In 1981 this training program added postdoctoral students
and now consists of 3 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral position. In this application, based on the
growth of our faculty and the increase in BIPOC and other URM students, we are requesting 4
rather than 3 predoctoral positions. The award-winning faculty on the training grant reflect various
sub- disciplines of developmental science, including child clinical psychology, developmental
behavioral neuroscience/developmental psychobiology, stress neurobiology, socioemotional
development, cognitive development, pediatrics, and prevention/intervention science. External
training faculty from other departments across the University of Minnesota (e.g., Family Social
Science, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Psychology, Pharmacology, Public Health - see Table2 in
application) also will serve as co-mentors of the pre- and –post doctoral trainees. This allows our
trainees to take advantage of the full richness of research in developmental psychopathology
available at the Universityof Minnesota. In any given year, the predoctoral trainees represent
approximately 10% of all Ph.D. students in the Institute of Child Development; thus, being placed
on the training grant is highly competitive. Students enter the training grant as 2nd, 3rd or 4th year
Ph.D. students (preferentially 3rd or 4th year) so that we can be more confident of their talent and of
their commitment to research areas pertinent to NIMH’s strategic goals. Postdoctoral trainees are
selected based on evidence of research potential, strong recommendations, and fit with the
program. Predoctoral trainees complete one of two Ph.D. tracks, the Developmental Science track
or the Developmental Psychopathology Clinical Science track; the latter involves a one-year
clinical internship. All predoctoral trainees receive training in professional development, ethics in
research, statistics, and cognitive and social development as part of the larger Ph.D. program. T32
trainees in addition take a course in developmental psychopathology, attend the annual research
ethnic UMN conference, present at the annual clinical research day and complete a grant-writing
course. Postdoctoral students complete the grant writing course and, in consultation with their
faculty mentor and the training grant director, any areas of developmentalscience that are critical
to their research program and in which they lacked sufficient prior training."

This project, titled the Indigenous Cultural-understandings of Alzheimer’s – Research and Engagement
(ICARE) focuses on the urgent need to address the increasing burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD) in American Indian (AI) and First Nations (FN) populations. Our central hypothesis is that
culture and community-specific context shape ADRD illness experiences in Indigenous populations
significantly enough to create distinct impacts of ADRD requiring culturally tailored approaches to diagnosis,
care and education. Our goal is to create a foundational ethnographic database of AI/FN lived experience of
ADRD that can be examined to inform the creation of culturally appropriate and safe approaches to improve
dementia diagnostics, care and outreach. Our findings will inform our longer-term goal to create culturally safe
clinical guidelines and dementia diagnosis and care tools for North American Indigenous populations.
AI/FN ADRD rates are approximately three times higher, with a 10-year earlier onset, compared to majority
populations. Higher rates of co-morbidities and limited access to social, economic, and health resources
increase Indigenous health disparities. Culture and community context influence Indigenous peoples’
experience with dementia and culturally grounded approaches/resources increase awareness and improve
outcomes. Currently, there is little information to guide culturally appropriate efforts to address ADRD.
Using community-based participatory research (CBPR), ICARE engages AI/FN communities in Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Ontario. We will undertake a CBPR qualitative ethnographic examination of the AI/FN lived
experience across the illness trajectory including: cultural understandings of ADRD; experiences with diagnosis
and care; and AI/FN community strengths and challenges. Specific methods include participant observation
and semi-structured in-depth interviews with people with dementia (PWD), caregivers, and healthy seniors.
Our qualitative analytic approach incorporates both biomedical and Indigenous understandings of ADRD.
 Our research has three specific aims. First, we will document and examine the lived experiences of ADRD
across the disease trajectory in 3 diverse AI/FN regions (Red Lake Nation and Grand Portage, MN; Oneida
Nation, WI; Manitoulin Island, ON) and identify cultural, health systems, and community factors influencing
ADRD diagnostic and care pathways for PWD. Second, we will use this ethnographic data to delineate AI/FN
specific explanatory models of ADRD and understandings of ADRD Quality of Life, diagnosis and staging to
identify appropriate approaches to diagnose and assess ADRD in AI/FN populations. Third, we will conduct
collaborative knowledge translation of ethnographic knowledge into culturally appropriate health
promotion/education tools (fact sheets, videos or training modules) to respond to community needs. This study
represents an important step in identifying effective, culturally-grounded approaches to address dementia-
related inequities in AI/FN populations."

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a dengue-Zika vaccine that provides protection against
the four serotypes of dengue (DENV1-4) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses with maximal safety and efficacy. To
date, flavivirus vaccine development has focused on the induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), as
they have been assumed to be the key mechanism for protection against natural infection. However,
DENV and perhaps ZIKV are unusual in that weak Ab responses to vaccination or prior infection can
induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection and pathogenesis during subsequent
reinfections. In fact, DENV disease with severe sequalae has been documented in children given the
only currently licensed DENV vaccine. Thus, the primary objective of this application is to develop an
effective vaccine against DENV and ZIKV that cannot mediate ADE. We hypothesize that this vaccine
will need to elicit both strong nAb responses and strong T cell effector responses that will counterbalance
the presence of any ADE-mediating Abs, based on our work investigating the interplay between Ab and
T cell responses to DENV and ZIKV. In particular, we have shown that CD8 T cells mediate cross-
protection against heterotypic DENV and ZIKV infections, and that DENV vaccine-elicited CD8 T cells
can prevent ADE. In addition, our preliminary data show that an RNA replicon-based vaccine expressing
ZIKV nonstructural protein 3 elicits only T cell but not nAb responses and confers protection against ZIKV
challenge in mice. Thus, we hypothesize that our combinatorial DENV-ZIKV vaccine expressing both Ab-
and T cell-targeting proteins of DENV1-4 and ZIKV will produce humoral and cellular immune responses
that provide robust, long-term protection against all five viruses. We will test this hypothesis by achieving
the following Specific Aims: 1) To evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy of a DENV-ZIKV vaccine. 2) To
determine the durability and mechanistic underpinnings of DENV-ZIKV vaccine-induced protective
immunity."

Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infections of the colon strike close to 500,000 people a year in the United
States, leading to nearly 30,000 deaths. The CDC has declared this organism an “urgent” threat to public health,
the highest threat category. C. difficile infections are difficult to treat in large part because the organism forms
dormant spores that survive antibiotic therapy and seed recolonization of the gut when antibiotics are withdrawn.
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the antibiotics used against C. difficile also kill many of the healthy
gut bacteria, clearing the way for C. difficile to recolonize when spores germinate. Thus, there is a tremendous
need for new drugs that target C. difficile without disrupting the healthy microbiota. The premise of this proposal
is that a deeper understanding of cell envelope biogenesis can pave the way towards developing better ways to
treat C. difficile infections. The cell envelope is a well-validated target for antibiotics, and in C. difficile the
envelope has some unusual features that suggest its assembly requires novel proteins that could be exploited
as targets of C. difficile-selective antibiotics. In Aim 1 we will use genetics, biochemistry and microscopy to
understand the roles and regulation of enzymes that crosslink the peptidoglycan cell wall. These enzymes
captured our attention because in C. difficile the cell wall contains an unusually high percentage of “3-3”
crosslinks as compared to the “4-3” crosslinks that predominate in most bacteria. Our experiments will address
the following questions: Which enzymes are responsible for 3-3 and 4-3 crosslink formation and do they operate
during division, elongation or both? How is the ratio of 3-3 to 4-3 crosslinking regulated? How does C. difficile
benefit from using primarily 3-3 crosslinks? In Aim 2 we will leverage a powerful new gene-silencing tool called
CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to assign a set of ~50 putatively essential envelope biogenesis genes to more
specific functional pathways. These genes are intrinsically interesting and constitute potential new antibiotic
targets. We will also undertake a detailed analysis of a novel transcriptional regulatory system uncovered in a
pilot version of our proposed screen. Collectively, the lines of investigation to be pursued here will greatly
advance our understanding of C. difficile biology by identifying new proteins involved in assembly of the cell
envelope and revealing how their activities are coordinated to accomplish the complex processes of growth and
division."
10849703,"Abstract
Sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by whole-body inflammation caused by the body's
response to an infection, is the most expensive and deadly condition treated in hospitals, with over 270,000
cases of sepsis-related deaths in the U.S. alone. Untreated sepsis may result in dilated and leaky blood
vessels and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive medications (aka septic shock), and eventual injury to
kidneys, lungs, and liver (aka organ injury) with mortality rates in excess of 40%. Successful prevention and
management of sepsis, septic shock, and organ injury rely on the ability of clinicians to anticipate and
estimate the risk, and administer the right life-saving treatments (e.g., antibiotics, fluids and vasopressors)
at the right time. In recent years, data-driven modeling has been shown to enable early prediction of sepsis
and to reveal clusters (or phenotypes) of sepsis, which may help with personalizing therapeutic
interventions. However, crossing the translational chasm between clinical research and improving patient
care also requires addressing 1) `data deserts' at different levels of care through better data integration,
smarter lab ordering, and utilization of continuous monitoring wearable sensors; 2) interoperability and
portability of clinical data and analytics; 3) principled dissemination and implementation studies; and 4)
education of the next generation of caregivers to effectively utilize advanced analytical tools.
The proposed research program builds upon PI's K01 early career development award focused on
multicenter development and validation of sepsis predictive analytic algorithms (including hourly EHR data
spanning ED and inpatient encounters from over 500,000 hospitalized patients across five district
healthcare systems). Drawing insights from recent advances in domain adaptation and multi-task learning
(sub-fields of machine learning), this project aims to discover generalizable dynamic phenotypes that are
directly relevant to the prediction and management of sepsis, septic shock, and downstream organ injury.
We propose to augment EHR-based analytics with high-resolution data from bedside devices (e.g.,
monitors, ventilators, dialysis, and IV pumps) and wearables (e.g., continuous blood pressure and lactate
sensors) to address existing gaps in monitoring. Additionally, this program aims at advancing FHIR (Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)
interoperability standards through the implementation of specific resources for high-resolution data sources.
Finally, this research program will be conducted in close collaboration with our dissemination and
implementation and hospital quality improvement teams to ensure early assessment of usability, barriers to
implementation, and effective education to maximize the potential for clinical impact."
10839792,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRIM5 is a multi-functional antiviral protein whose various actions in host defense are
still being uncovered. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these antiviral actions is an
essential step towards the possible development of TRIM5-based host-directed antiviral therapies. TRIM5 is
best known as an antiviral effector against diverse families of viruses including flaviviruses and retroviruses.
TRIM5 also has roles in antiviral signaling that can trigger the expression of cytokines including type 1
interferon in response to retroviral pattern recognition. We previously reported a third major role for TRIM5: it
acts as a positive regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and it physically interacts with proteins acting in
multiple steps of the autophagy pathway. This raises the question of what the autophagy pathway and/or the
autophagy machinery might be contributing to TRIM5’s antiviral activities. In this project, we will answer this
question and work towards the long-term goal of understanding how TRIM5 coordinates its actions in
defending against retroviral infection. Our preliminary data demonstrate that cells lacking autophagy-related
proteins (ATGs) involved in upstream autophagy regulation, autophagosome membrane elongation, and
autophagic cargo selection are unable to carry out TRIM5-directed inflammatory signaling. Whereas autophagy
is typically considered a degradative process, in this setting the ATGs tested contributed to assembling active
TRIM5 signaling complexes. This suggests that TRIM5 orchestrates novel, non-canonical functions of the
ATGs with which it interacts. These findings support a hypothesis in which TRIM5’s actions in inflammatory
signaling and in establishing an antiviral state are linked to its actions in autophagy. We will use cell biological,
immunological, and proteomic approaches to test this hypothesis. We will uncover the role(s) of the autophagy
pathway and individual autophagy-related proteins in TRIM5-dependent antiviral signaling (Aims 1 and 2). Our
third Aim will uncover a novel TRIM5 signaling pathway connected to the inflammatory and autophagy-
regulatory kinase TBK1, which we identified as a retrovirus-responsive TRIM5 interactor through proteomic
analysis. Understanding TRIM5 signaling is significant, since TRIM5 signaling could explain why certain TRIM5
alleles confer protection against HIV infection in people despite human TRIM5’s relative inability to directly
restrict HIV. As outcomes, we anticipate that our proposed studies will: i) reveal novel pathways for antiviral
defense; ii) enable our understanding of how cells respond to detection of retroviral infection; and iii) provide
mechanistic insight into how TRIM5, a protein that has shaped the evolution of primate retroviruses, acts in
antiviral defense and innate immunity. We also expect that our findings will shed light on the broader TRIM
family of proteins (TRIMs). This protein family consists of roughly 80 genes in humans. Like TRIM5, many
TRIMs also have roles in antiviral defense, inflammation, and autophagy; thus understanding TRIM5 may
provide a firm foundation for the study of other TRIMs."
10875395,"Abstract. There is great interest in technologies that measure protein stability, because many devastating
diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease) are linked to protein misfolding and instability. One especially
promising way to treat these diseases is to use small molecules, termed “correctors” that bind to the damaged
protein and partially restore its folding. Multiple correctors have received FDA approval (e.g. ivacaftor, tafamadis,
migalastat), but there are hundreds of additional misfolding diseases. What are the hurdles to the rapid discovery
of additional correctors? One important barrier is that previous correctors have been uncovered through
prolonged searches, using specialized (i.e. target-specific) technologies that are not versatile enough for use
across many proteins-of-interest (POIs). Here, we propose next-generation Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
(DSF) to fill this gap. In a typical DSF experiment, a POI is heated in a qPCR instrument and its un-folding is
monitored by its binding to a solvatochromatic dye (e.g. Sypro Orange, SO). The resulting temperature vs.
fluorescence curves are then used to estimate the melting transition (Tm), with putative correctors identified by
their effect on this value (DTm). DSF is versatile because it does not require protein labeling or structural
knowledge. Moreover, unlike comparable platforms, such as circular dichroism (CD) or differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), DSF is amenable to 384-well plate format, facilitating large-scale chemical screens. While
DSF has the potential to transform corrector discovery, there are major hurdles to overcome. For example, DSF
often fails because SO does not bind the target protein or it binds to hydrophobic patches on the native state,
obscuring the Tm. Further, for some POIs, the temperature-fluorescence curves are complex, with multiple
transitions, and therefore not readily analyzed or fit using standard equations. Based on our preliminary screens
of ~50 different proteins, these issues cause DSF to fail in more than 60% of cases. We propose to solve these
issues through disruptive innovations: (SA1) Design and synthesis of next-generation dye libraries that
significantly expand the scope of DSF and (SA2) Theory- and experiment-driven, dramatic improvements in data
analysis, enabled by machine learning and made publicly available through a web portal (DSFWorld).
Encouraged by preliminary success, we also propose to: (SA3) Expand the scope of DSF applications by
pioneering studies of multi-protein complexes and conformational changes. Importantly, we will benchmark each
of these innovations against current state-of-the-art approaches, with a focus on a critical understanding of
strengths and weaknesses. Together, these studies are expected to dramatically expand the scope of DSF
technology."

synuclein (α-syn) oligomers and amyloids linked to Parkinson's Disease (PD) and rescue neurodegeneration in
a rat PD model. However, Hsp104 activity is limited against α-syn and high Hsp104 concentrations are
required for optimal effects. Thus, we engineered potentiated Hsp104 variants, which dissolve fibrils formed by
?-syn as well as TDP-43 and FUS (which are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD), an Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementia (ADRD), which mitigate neurodegeneration in the
metazoan nervous system more effectively than Hsp104. Though potent disaggregases, these potentiated
Hsp104 variants lack substrate specificity and are prone to toxic off-target effects. To address this issue, we
engineered new potentiated Hsp104 variants with minimal off-target effects and α-syn-specific Hsp104
variants, which exhibited enhanced therapeutic utility. These engineered disaggregases could provide a
disruptive technology to combat neurodegenerative disease and enable purification of aggregation-prone
proteins for basic or pharmaceutical purposes. Curiously, Hsp104 does not have an exact metazoan ortholog.
Remarkably, we have found that a partial homolog of Hsp104 found in human mitochondria, an AAA+ protein
called Skd3 (human ClpB), has powerful protein disaggregase activity comparable to potentiated Hsp104
variants. Despite these important advances, our mechanistic understanding of Hsp104 and Skd3 is limited by
three critical barriers. First, we do not understand how Hsp104 selects substrates for disaggregation. Thus, we
have not yet developed TDP-43- or FUS-specific variants for ALS/FTD. Second, we do not understand how
Hsp104 is regulated. Thus, the mechanism by which specific mutations in nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2)
potentiate Hsp104 remain unclear. Third, Skd3 is poorly characterized in terms of its disaggregase capabilities,
structure, and mechanism. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that: (1) potentiated Hsp104
variants can be engineered to be more selective for ALS/FTD-linked TDP-43 and FUS; (2) specific NBD2
mutations potentiate Hsp104 via a novel mechanism; and (3) Skd3 is a powerful human protein disaggregase
with broad capabilities and mechanistic similarities to Hsp104. Thus, we will meet three aims: (1) Define
Hsp104 variants with enhanced TDP-43 and FUS selectivity; (2) Define how specific NBD2 mutations
potentiate Hsp104 activity; (3) Define the capabilities, mechanism, and structure of the human Skd3 AAA+
disaggregase. In this way, we will secure an enhanced mechanistic understanding of Hsp104 and Skd3, which
will empower their development for important applications in biotechnology and medicine."
10846803,"UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1) uses the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize a form of vitamin K called menaquinone-4 (MK-4). UBIAD1 is multifunctional as indicated by the association of mutations in human UBIAD1 with Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD). This rare autosomal dominant eye disease is characterized by progressive corneal opacification owing to abnormal accumulation of cholesterol. Our studies revealed that sterols cause UBIAD1 to bind endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of cholesterol and essential nonsterol isoprenoids including farnesyl pyrophosphate, GGpp, MK-4, ubiquinone, and dolichol. Sterol- induced ubiquitination is obligatory for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR that is augmented by GGpp and constitutes one mechanism for feedback control of the enzyme. GGpp blocks sterol-induced binding of UBIAD1 to HMGCR, which enhances its ERAD and permits ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. SCD- associated mutants of UBIAD1 resist GGpp-induced displacement from HMGCR and remain sequestered in the ER to inhibit ERAD, which contributes to enhanced synthesis and intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. Gene knockout studies in mice were attempted to elucidate the role of UBIAD1 in tissue-specific distribution of MK-4, which remains a major unresolved question in vitamin K biology. However, homozygous germ-line deletion of Ubiad1 caused embryonic lethality. We recently generated homozygous deletion of Ubiad1 in knock- in mice expressing ubiquitination-resistant HMGCR, which implies embryonic lethality associated with Ubiad1 deficiency results from enhanced ERAD of HMGCR and depletion of mevalonate metabolites distinct from MK- 4. We will now elucidate tissue-specific roles of UBIAD1 in regulating HMGCR ERAD and MK-4 synthesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Explore role of UBIAD1-mediated sensing of GGpp in regulation of HMGCR ERAD and mevalonate metabolism in the liver; 2) Determine contribution of UBIAD1-mediated synthesis of MK-4 to skeletal muscle homeostasis; 3) Establish roles for UBIAD1 in pancreatic subsistence and function; and 4) Examine role of UBIAD1 in morphology and function of the intestine. Combined efforts of the PIs, who have complementary expertise in mechanisms underlying regulation of cholesterol metabolism (DeBose-Boyd) and vitamin K biology (Booth), will lead to discovery of tissue-specific pathways/processes modulated by MK-4. In addition, these studies will have immediate clinical implications. HMGCR is the target of statins, widely prescribed drugs that lower plasma LDL-cholesterol and reduce incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, statins trigger responses that cause accumulation of HMGCR, which blunts their clinical effects. Part of this increase results from UBIAD1-mediated inhibition of HMGCR ERAD. Our studies may expose UBIAD1-mediating sensing of GGpp as a target of therapies that prevent statin-induced accumulation of HMGCR, increasing statin efficacy and ultimately reducing incidence of CVD and heart attacks."
10841032,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize mechanistic pathways in astrocytes
responsible for changes in drug-evoked structural and synaptic plasticity that underlie the maladaptive behavior
in opioid drug abuse. Astrocytes are a logical focus for these studies, as they are intimately involved in diverse
neuronal function, including modulation of synaptic function and plasticity, regulating concentrations of the
excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and yet secrete and response to neuroinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, and growth factors. These processes are themselves regulated by autophagy: the process by which
cells both engage in orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components as well as balancing energy
metabolism. Although astrocyte-mediated excitation and inflammation have been implicated in neuroadaptations
and drug-seeking behavior, the role of astrocytes autophagy in the mechanism underlying the intersection
between the glutamate system and neuroimmune signaling, is not well understood. Findings from our lab showed
that a key autophagy protein, Beclin1, is strongly associated with the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors released from glia and neurons. We also showed that activation of autophagy increases glutamate
uptake along with glutamate transporters expressed in astrocytes, collectively establishing a strong premise for
the current proposed investigations. Extending our initial studies, here we hypothesize that autophagy-
mediated neuroimmune signaling and glutamate metabolism in astrocytes ± HIV alters neuronal circuitry
to promote opioid use disorder (OUD) and abuse. Since opioid and HIV-infection are common comorbidities,
and opioids are commonly prescribed to HIV-infected individuals experiencing pain, studies will include
assessment of HIV-infection through use of EcoHIV in a series of mouse models, facilitating the needed
behavioral, neuroanatomical, and mechanistic studies to address the current knowledge gap. In Specific Aim
(SA) 1 we will use Becn1+/- and Becn1+/+ mice to define the role of astrocyte autophagy with or without HIV and/or
chronic opioid exposure on the progression and magnitude of opioid addiction, withdrawal, long-term abstinence,
and relapse in validated behavioral models. In SA 2 we will use brain tissue harvested from mice tested in Aim
1 to decipher the interlink between excitation and inflammation-evoked changes in neurochemical and
neuroanatomical plasticity and maladaptive behavior in opioid drug abuse (with or without HIV), through the lens
of astrocytes autophagy. In SA 3 we will use brain cells to further investigate the mechanisms by which Beclin1
interacts with the μ-opioid receptor and/or associated proteins and analyze how Beclin1 activity modulates
endolysosomal trafficking and degradation of MOR intracellular trafficking in brain cells in response to opioid
(with and without HIV). Findings are expected to produce mechanistic insights into how autophagy regulates the
underlying crosstalk between astrocytes and neuronal circuitry mediating OUD and abuse behaviors, yielding
both novel therapeutic targets for development and strategies for preventing OUD in at risk HIV populations."

The overall aim of Core D is to provide correlative biomarker analyses (including bioinformatics analysis) of
primary specimens in the MPN-RC tissue bank, samples arising from all MPN-RC clinical trials, experiments in
Projects 1-3, and prospective tissue banking efforts. Core D will carry out assessment of somatic genomic
alterations on all MPN-RC samples derived from tissue banking efforts, and from therapeutic trials at baseline
and the time of response assessment. The core will also carry out dynamic analyses of other mechanism-
based biomarkers (such as serum cytokines, single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing studies, cytogenetics, and
histopathology) which pertain to each of the biologic and clinical studies in Projects 1-3. The use of genomic
profiling will provide Projects 1-3 with the ability to select genetically annotated samples for biologic studies
aimed at investigating the relationship between somatic mutations, biological features of disease pathogenesis,
and therapeutic dependencies. The core will also carry out dynamic analyses of mechanism-based biomarkers
which pertain to each of the biologic and clinical studies in Projects 1-4. The goal of these assays is to provide
comprehensive genetic and biologic correlative studies as well as to help determine the mechanistic impact,
and the ability to deplete Myelofibrosis (MF) stem cells, of these hypothesis-driven therapeutic interventions.
The proposed analyses will result in integrated genomic, gene expression, and cytokine data of a large number
of clinically annotated and homogenously treated patients. As well, the clinical trials proposed in Project 4 are
mechanistically based, and stem from work in Projects 1-3. The correlative biomarker assays are directly
related to the proposed mechanisms of action of the therapeutic agents which will be investigated in Project 4.
These studies will allow for an assessment of the mechanistic impact of specific therapeutic interventions and
allow us to credential novel therapeutic targets and pathways. In addition, this will allow biological assessment
of treatment responders and non-responders, thus giving insight into mechanisms of resistance. Importantly,
we have developed rigorous organizational tools in order to maintain data integrity, traceability and
reproducibility standards when dealing with the amount and the variety of data involved in the large-scale

10880531,"The I-SPY2 Trial accelerated development of novel therapies for breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting through its
design as a phase II, multicenter platform trial. Since launching in 2010, 24 new therapies or combinations have been
tested, and 7 were found to significantly improve pathologic complete response (pCR), leading to several definitive phase
III trials. However, with this success came the realization that not every patient benefited, and the serial addition of drugs
to the standard regimen came at a cost in terms of increased toxicity. In 2015, the I-SPY P01 led to further development of
tools that address these issues, including tools to better evaluate individual patient responses to therapy and subsequent
event-free survival outcomes, that have enabled escalation for poor responders and de-escalation for exceptional
responders. This has led to some patients receiving additional therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or
platinums and others being able to forego the toxicity of agents such as anthracyclines, key initial steps toward treatment
individualization and precision medicine. These innovations have led to shared decision-making over the course of
neoadjuvant therapy and necessitated the expansion of the number of sites to participate in the trial. Project 1 was
instrumental in coordinating the efforts of the other projects in developing these tools, implementing and validating them
within the I-SPY2 trial as well as galvanizing the I-SPY Trial team in designing the next generation trial, I-SPY2.2. We
now hypothesize that by further refining the process of escalation and de-escalation in the I-SPY2.2 Trial, including the
integration of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and our novel Response Predictive Subtype schema into key decision
processes and timepoints, we can improve the proportion of patients who achieve pCR across the entire trial population
and reduce recurrence, through better matching patients to drugs that maximize an individual’s chance for pCR while
concurrently reducing toxicity of treatment and improving patient well-being. Project 1 will test this hypothesis in the
process of cyclical improvements in the real-time, biomarker-based decision making along the course of the trial, with the
goal of further optimizing outcomes for individual patients in the context of drug development for early breast cancer. In
Project 1, we will further leverage the work of Projects 2-4 to implement refinements to the sequential randomization
(escalation strategy) to best-in-class rescue therapies for poor responders and de-escalation to minimize unnecessary
therapy in exceptional responders. We will develop novel measures to compare tested agents, such as changes in the RCB
distribution (as trial arm level proximate outcome) and composite measures of efficacy and toxicity (including patient-
reported outcomes (PRO)). PRO and a return of results process will also be used to evaluate impacts on patient
perception, shared decision-making, and predictors of adverse psychological outcomes. Finally, we will further build onto
the I-SPY2.2 phase II infrastructure to add a regulatory pathway for therapies and/or sequences that demonstrate success
in improving outcomes and/or reducing toxicity in the neoadjuvant setting."

10839809,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) coordinate a wide variety of signaling networks to maintain metabolic homeostasis.
As a rare secretory cell lineage of the gut epithelium, EECs sense and respond to luminal stimuli by releasing a
diverse array of hormones that control nutrient sensing, appetite, glycemic regulation, and energy balance. Diet-
induced obesity and bariatric surgery have been associated with the dysregulation and restoration of these
hormonal pathways, respectively. Moreover, a growing number of pharmacological strategies have emerged that
target key EEC signaling pathways to treat metabolic disease. However, despite these advances the molecular
mechanisms regulating EEC biology remain incompletely defined. To address this knowledge gap, this proposal
aims to determine the role of an EEC-enriched microRNA (miRNA), miR-375, in regulating the effects of dietary
and surgical interventions on EEC biology. MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules that respond to
changing environmental contexts and modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. As such,
miRNAs are critical regulators of a myriad of biological pathways, including intestinal epithelial development and
function. Our lab has previously demonstrated that miR-375 is highly enriched both in intestinal stem cells (ISCs)
and along the EEC lineage, and its expression is dramatically reduced by chronic high-fat diet. In addition, our
preliminary data demonstrate significant rescue of miR-375 expression in ISCs following bariatric surgery,
coinciding with increases in EEC abundance and circulating gut hormone levels. Therefore, I hypothesize that
miR-375 exerts context-specific effects on EEC biology during the pathogenesis and amelioration of diet-induced
obesity. The proposed studies will test this hypothesis through an interdisciplinary approach using our lab’s
established colony of miR-375 knockout (375-KO) mice together with cutting-edge genomic and bioinformatic
techniques. In Aim 1, I will assess how the loss of miR-375 exerts diet-specific effects on the distribution of
different EEC subtypes by performing high-resolution single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of small
intestinal crypts and villi from wildtype (WT) and 375-KO animals fed either a chronic chow or high-fat diet. In
Aim 2, I will determine how miR-375 contributes to surgically-induced EEC adaptations and metabolic
improvements through scRNA-seq analyses of crypt and villus samples from diet-induced obese WT and 375-
KO mice following bariatric surgery or a control procedure. With these single-cell datasets, I will bioinformatically
determine context-dependent changes in overall EEC abundance, subtype distribution (correlated with
circulating gut hormone levels), and gene expression (including identification of candidate miR-375 targets). I
will also validate these molecular findings in vivo through immunohistochemical assays and metabolic
parameters such as body weight and glucose tolerance. Altogether, these findings will further our understanding
of EEC regulation and may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities."
10849819,"The salivary glands are exocrine glands that produce saliva. An adequate supply of
saliva is critical to the maintenance of oral tissue. Saliva is composed of a variety of electrolytes
and also contains immunoglobulins, proteins, enzymes and mucins, suggesting that saliva has a
complex function. An important function of salivary gland ducts is to regulate ion
homeostasis[1]. Dysfunction of epithelial ion homeostasis can lead to several human
diseases[2, 3]. Our lineage tracing experiments using a tamoxifen inducible FGF10CreERT2:R26-
Tomato mouse identified new epithelial populations of the Fgf10 expressing cells in the striated
(SD), granular (GCT) and excretory ducts (ED) of submandibular (SMG) and parotid (PG)
glands. Importantly Fgf10 lineage tracing shows that until postnatal day 7 (P7) only
mesenchymal Fgf10 expressing cells are present, however after P10, Fgf10 expression in the
mesenchyme shuts down, while a subset of ductal epithelial cells starts to express Fgf10. Using
Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) we isolated both mesenchymal and epithelial
populations of Fgf10+ cells and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Analysis of this RNA-
seq data combined with analysis of single cell RNA-Seq (scRNAseq) data from P1 and adult
SMGs showed that epithelial Fgf10+ populations overlap with the known duct population marked
by Ascl3. Moreover, these epithelial Fgf10+ cells expressed many gene characteristics for an
ancient type of ionocyte cell: Bsnd, Foxi1, Foxi2, Asgr1, Stap1, several subunits of the H+-
ATPase (V-ATPase) and markers of SLC12A1/2 and Slc9a4 transporters. Most importantly
Fgf10+ cells expressed cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) that plays a
key role in exocrine secretion, including in salivary glands. We propose that these epithelial
Fgf10+/Ascl3+/Cftr+ cells are specialized duct salivary gland ionocytes. Moreover, using two
models of Sjogrens syndrome: the NOD.B10Sn-H2b/J and the thrombospondin-1 null (TSP1-/-)
mice, we showed a significant decrease in Fgf10+ expression and the number of ionocytes with
disease progression. We also showed that epithelial Fgf10+ cells isolated from the SMG are
able to maintain proliferation and growth of progenitor and myoepithelial cells, suggesting an
additional role for ionocytes in ductal maintenance. In this application we will determine the role
of Fgf10 signaling in SMG regeneration and ionocyte function, define factors that control
ionocyte differentiation and determine how chronic inflammation affects ionocyte function. In
addition, in collaboration with Dr. Hoffman's group using bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data we
will investigate whether salivary glands have one type or several types of ionocytes. Our
proposed study will provide a starting platform for future studies of ionocytes in basic biology
and clinical research."
10847521,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Acquired hearing loss is becoming increasingly common, especially with the growth of the aging population.
For many individuals, hearing loss is severe enough to warrant cochlear implantation. While many adults
with cochlear implants (CIs) understand speech well through their devices, enormous unexplained variability
exists in speech recognition outcomes, as well as in the trajectory of speech recognition improvement (i.e.,
perceptual learning) after implantation. Unfortunately, because of this unexplained variability, clinicians are
unable to predict how an individual will perform with a CI, to explain why someone has poor speech
recognition with a CI, or to design appropriate rehabilitation strategies to help an individual with poor
performance. Currently, only half of this outcome variability can be explained by traditional clinical measures.
Recent studies have suggested that individual differences in speech recognition among CI users reflect
variability in more basic sensory (“bottom-up”) and cognitive-linguistic (“top-down”) factors. These factors
should explain additional variability in CI outcomes, and a comprehensive integrative model incorporating
traditional clinical measures along with bottom-up and top-down factors is needed. The overall objective of
the proposed project is to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the sources of unexplained variability in CI
speech recognition outcomes and perceptual learning. Aim 1 will determine the degree to which pre-
operative measures of bottom-up sensory functions and top-down cognitive-linguistic processes predict CI
speech recognition outcomes. Aim 2 will investigate the degree to which additional objective bottom-up
sensory processes, and especially their interactions with top-down factors, explain sentence recognition. Aim
3 will investigate the trajectories of perceptual learning in speech recognition that occur during the first two
years of CI use. The findings from this research project will have important theoretical and clinical
implications by comprehensively delineating the contributions and interactions of bottom-up and top-down
factors as they relate to variability in recognition of speech, as well as helping clinicians to better predict
pre-operatively and understand post-operatively the outcomes and time course of perceptual learning that
occurs after implantation."
10841510,"Pericyte-Macrophage Interactions Maintain CNS Immune Tolerance
ABSTRACT
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) where infiltrating T cells
ultimately lead to the destruction of myelin. T cells initially accumulate in the perivascular space of the brain and
the meninges where they must interact with antigen presenting cells prior to activating and infiltrating into the
parenchyma. This suggests immune interactions in the perivascular space may serve as a checkpoint and
determine the fate of infiltrating T cells. Macrophages and pericytes are two important cells in the perivascular
space of the brain and meninges. Under homeostatic conditions, border macrophages have an immuno-
surveillant phenotype and express surface markers typical for macrophages that help with healing tissues. The
signals that maintain CNS border macrophages in this state are unknown. Pericytes also reside in the
perivascular space and are a key component of the neurovascular unit where they regulate blood flow,
angiogenesis, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuroinflammation. Although each cell type has be implicated
in multiple sclerosis (MS), the communication between the 2 cell types has not been described. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that cultured pericytes suppress the activation of T cells through engaging macrophages.
Pericytes directly contact macrophages and reprogram them to downregulate genes need for antigen
presentation and T cells activation. Pericytes/macrophage interactions are mediated by lipoprotein receptor-
related proteins (LRP) on macrophages and dependent on p-bodies in pericytes. P-bodies are membrane-less,
cytoplasmic organelles that contain mRNAs enriched in regulatory functions. In vivo, pericytes reside in close
proximity to perivascular and meningeal macrophages and have the potential to interact closely with
macrophages. When we deleted pericytes in vivo, CNS antigen specific T cells infiltrate the perivascular space
of the meninges in a manner that was dependent on macrophages. T cells further infiltrate into the parenchyma
when triggered by a second signal from the parenchymal.
We hypothesize that under homeostatic conditions pericytes communicate with perivascular and meningeal
macrophages to maintain them in an immunosuppressive and surveillant state. This contributes to the immuno-
privileged nature of the brain. In MS, we hypothesize that communication between pericytes and macrophages
breakdown and this unleashes CNS macrophages into a proinflammatory state that contributes to T cell
activation and infiltration into the brain. In this proposal, we will determine if pericytes instruct perivascular
macrophages to inhibit brain-specific T cells from entering the parenchyma, investigate whether pericytes
reprogram CNS macrophages in vivo, and determine if macrophages must engulf components of pericytes in
order to be reprogramed to suppress T cells. Overall, this proposal will investigate an unexplored interaction
between pericytes and CNS border macrophages."
10851730,"A wearable alcohol biosensor could represent a tremendous advance towards helping people make informed
decisions about their drinking and, ultimately, towards curbing alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.
Transdermal sensors, which measure alcohol consumption by assessing the alcohol content of insensible
perspiration, offer a uniquely non-invasive, passive, and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of
drinking likely to be attractive to a range of populations. But the relationship between transdermal alcohol
concentration (TAC) and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is highly complex, varying across individuals and
contexts and involving some degree of lag time. Prior research, which has featured extremely small participant
samples and examined old-generation transdermal devices, has been poorly suited to modeling this
complexity. Thus, scientists are left with little sense for how to translate data produced by transdermal sensors
into estimates of BAC. Importantly, the past decade has seen remarkable technological and analytic
developments, offering the potential to tackle the challenge of TAC-BAC translation. In particular, in recent
years, machine learning approaches have been developed that are particularly well suited to modeling highly
complex and time-lagged relationships within larger datasets. Also during this time period, a new generation of
transdermal device has come under development, featuring sleek/compact designs, smartphone integration,
and capabilities for sampling TAC at approximately 90 times the rate of older-generation devices. These
sensors thus provide a rich source of data for machine learning models and also, for the first time, the potential
to produce transdermal BAC estimates in real time. The proposed research leverages machine learning, novel
transdermal technology, and large-scale multimodal human testing to translate transdermal sensor data into
estimates of BAC. Transdermal sensors will be examined in the context of multimodal research featuring a
large and diverse participant sample (N=240) examined both inside and outside the laboratory. The
ambulatory arm of the proposed project is aimed at capturing the TAC-BAC relationship across individuals in
varying real-world drinking contexts, examining regular drinkers wearing new-generation transdermal sensors
in everyday settings while providing prompted breathalyzer readings. This ambulatory research will be
complemented by a laboratory study arm, aimed at examining the TAC-BAC relationship among individuals
drinking in a controlled setting while alcohol dose and rate of consumption are systematically manipulated.
Machine learning algorithms, including deep neural network models, will be used to create estimates of BAC
from transdermal sensor data. These estimates will be examined in terms of their accuracy, temporal
specificity, and also context-dependence. Thus, results will carry significance for addiction science by
translating transdermal sensor data and clarifying the place of these sensors in our arsenal of techniques for
assessing, preventing, and treating problem drinking."
10853033,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is common and contributes to extensive functional impairments, morbidity
and mortality. Evidence-based psychosocial treatments, in particular Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT)
and Motivational Interviewing (MI), are effective; but, fewer than 10% of people with AUD receive treatment.
Prior efforts have focused on screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in primary care.
However, referral has failed to increase treatment use due to barriers (e.g., poor treatment accessibility, stigma
of specialty addiction clinics) causing referred patients not to seek care. In addition, patients who are typically
non-treatment seeking (i.e., patients not presenting for AUD care) may vary in their drinking goals. Thus, new
models of care to engage and deliver effective treatments across the spectrum of the large, dispersed
population of AUD patients are critically needed.
 Telemedicine, specifically synchronous videoconferencing between providers and patients in separate
locations, can potentially help increase treatment utilization by delivering care to patients at home and reducing
stigma of attending treatment in specialty care settings. Telemedicine is effective for many conditions, but there
have been no efficacy trials to date for AUD. Although limited telemedicine infrastructure has been a barrier in
the past, the COVID-19 pandemic has proven that it can be rapidly implemented and widely used. There is an
urgent need to determine if telemedicine delivered AUD treatment is efficacious to inform dissemination.
Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate a telemedicine-delivered MI-CBT treatment intervention for
AUD (MI-CBT TeleTx) compared to Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) on AUD treatment utilization and alcohol use.
Primary care patients with AUD in two large healthcare systems in southeast Michigan will be recruited and
randomized to either MI-CBT TeleTx or EUC. Specific Aims are:
 Aim 1: Determine the impact of providing the option of the TeleTx intervention (n=150) compared to
EUC (n=150) in primary care patients with AUD on AUD treatment utilization. Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of
the TeleTx intervention compared to EUC on percent drinking days and percent heavy drinking days across 3-,
6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Aim 3: Determine the effect of the TeleTx intervention on alcohol-related
consequences and functioning (e.g., quality of life, mental health) and the moderating effect of alcohol risk
level reductions. In addition, an exploratory aim is to determine key mediators of the effect of intervention on
treatment use (through improved treatment accessibility and reduced stigma) and on alcohol use (through
treatment use). Impact: The findings from this study will have a significant public health impact as a novel and
scalable approach to address the large AUD treatment gap. Further, the work will be the first large efficacy trial
of a telemedicine AUD intervention and test a new model of care designed to engage non-treatment seeking
patients and deliver effective AUD treatment to patients outside of traditional specialty care settings."

as a major contributor. However, the molecular triggers for neuroinflammatory response and factors mediating
and regulating the process remains enigmatic. Antiviral defense mechanisms control nucleic acid-based
parasites, most noticeably the invading viruses. Type I IFN (IFN) cytokines, a key component of antiviral innate
immunity, is a product of signaling activation of mammalian nucleic acid innate immune sensors that detect viral
genomes or their replication products. We recently reported that plaque-associated microglia innately reacted to
nucleic acid-containing amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and promote chronic gliosis and synapse loss in various Aβ
models. While grossly upregulated in clinic AD, IFN pathway unexpectedly escalates with increased BRAAK
staging, which implies an idiosyncratic IFN response in association with human tau pathology. We have since
confirmed a prominent IFN pathway activation in different murine tauopathy models. Genomic instability is a core
hallmark of aging. Senescent cells dysregulate their epigenome and derepress transposable elements (TE or
transposons), endogenous parasites widely distributed in the genome. Consequently, activation of L1
retrotransposable element triggers an antiviral innate immune response, resulting in IFN production. In parallel,
we found that tau overexpression relaxed neuronal heterochromatin, which is correlated with elevated
transcription of L1 and other TEs in tauopathy brains. Remarkably, IFN signaling is activated in aging brain and
polymorphisms of several ISGs as a group impose as a risk factor for AD. Based on these intriguing findings,
we seek to investigate how antiviral immune response is coupled to derepressed transposon activity during AD
pathogenesis in this proposal. Specifically, we plan to examine the involvement of L1 and retroelements in
conjunction with the onset of neuroinflammation under tauopathy and aging conditions (aim 1), identify the key
signaling mediators facilitating tau-stimulated antiviral response in the brain (aim 2) and elucidate epigenetic
influence on transposon derepression and antiviral inflammation in tauopathy and brain aging (aim 3)."

Project Summary:
Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence Phase I and II funding for the animal models core (AMC)
established a research core with expertise in respiratory and infectious diseases, including state-of-the-art
equipment and animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) housing and procedural facilities. With Phase III the AMC will
be expanding its services for the ABSL-2 studies with new cutting-edge equipment for phenotyping of animal
models of respiratory and infectious disease. In addition, the AMC will be expanding its services to ABSL-3
animal models to better address the urgent needs for BSL3 research at the state level as well as the national
level. The central objective of this Phase III proposal is to strengthen the existing BSL2 infrastructure and
services and enhance the AMC with ABSL-3 capabilities to adapt to the expanding needs in respiratory and
infectious disease research in Oklahoma. The aims of this proposal are: i) Aim 1: Provide a state-of-the-art
ABSL-2/3 service to CoBRE pilot projects and other Oklahoma researchers; ii) Aim 2: Provide ABSL-2/3
experimental and regulatory training to CoBRE investigators; iii) Aim 3: Develop a sustainable and
independent ABSL-2/3 AMC for use beyond Phase III funding. As a result of Phase III activities, the AMC
will increase interdisciplinary interactions between and training of Oklahoma Center for Respiratory Infectious
Disease (OCRID) researchers at Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma Medical
Research Foundation."
10881711,"Pilot Project Grant Program
Project Summary
In the Phase I and Phase II award periods, the pilot project grant program was administered via the
administrative core and had a significant impact on the research landscape in the field of respiratory and
infectious diseases across the State of Oklahoma. In Phase III, we will continue the successful pilot project
grant program to nurture junior investigators in the field of respiratory infectious disease research and attract
established investigators who are not currently engaged in respiratory infectious disease research into the
center's thematic area. The major objectives of the pilot project grant program are to provide seed funding to
generate preliminary data for an extramural research grant application and to provide research and career
guidance to the pilot project leaders for their short- and long-term success. The specific aims are (1) solicit,
select and award up to 6 pilot project grants annually; (2) provide infrastructure and research guidance to pilot
project leaders to facilitate project development; and (3) provide career guidance to pilot project leaders for
long-term success. Maintaining a constant influx of investigators and guiding them to a productive extramurally
funded career in respiratory infectious research is essential for sustaining the center both during and beyond
Phase III."
10814829,"Abstract
An essential component of Phase III CoBRE funding for the Center for Cancer Biology Research (CCBR) is
support of the Histology & Imaging Core (Core B). The Imaging Core, established in 2007, and the Molecular
Pathology Core, established in 2011, were both extensively utilized not only by CCBR investigators but also
those at Sanford Research at large as well as investigators from regional institutions. Their merging to establish
the Histology & Imaging Core in 2018, united these highly utilized cores to provide more efficient support from
staff offering extensive expertise in these areas. In addition to providing state-of-the-art equipment, the Histology
& Imaging Core staff provide a wide array of services (standard and custom) that afford investigators high quality
data without the investment of their time for troubleshooting or obtaining expertise in the technique. Continued
CoBRE support for this Scientific Core as it transitions to a schedule of fee-for-services will provide the necessary
time to obtain self-sustainability. As this Core expands its services, it will continue developing a larger collection
of clients. In this way, self-sufficiency will be attained. Already, the reputation of the Core's quality work and quick
turnaround has expanded regionally resulting in its increased usage. CoBRE funding through Phase III will
ensure successful self-sustainability will be obtained."
10866390,"Overall Abstract Myeloproliferative Neoplasm- Research Consortium
P.I. Ronald Hoffman M.D.
The Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Research Consortium (MPN-RC) is an interactive group of laboratory,
translational and clinical scientists from 13 institutions who have worked for almost 14 years in a coordinated
fashion to develop and evaluate therapeutic strategies aimed to improve the survival of patients with
myelofibrosis (MF). The MPNs, including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary MF, are
clonal hematological malignancies which originate at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell. We will continue
to focus our efforts on MF since it is the MPN associated with the shortest survival and at present allogeneic
stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapeutic modality. Unfortunately, over 90% of MF patients are
not candidates for stem cell transplantation. The only currently approved therapy for MF is first generation JAK2
inhibitor therapies, which have not proven to be disease modifying. Approximately one half of patients
discontinue JAK2 inhibitor therapy within 3 years and three-fourths by 5 years. The median survival after
discontinuation of JAK2 inhibitor therapy is approximately 14 months. The limitations of first generation JAK2
inhibitor therapy can be attributed to its inability to selectively attenuate the fitness of MF clonal hematopoietic
stem cells. The overall strategy of the MPN-RC is based on the hypothesis that although MF is uniformly
associated with activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, that increased clinical benefit for MF patients
will require the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies, which utilize combinations of drugs that interrupt
dysregulated interacting cellular pathways and deplete or eliminate MF stem cells by directly targeting
vulnerabilities in MPN stem cells and/or their interplay with the MF microenvironment. Based on discovery
science and preclinical therapeutic studies, rationally designed therapies will be evaluated in rigorous,
independent, investigator-initiated clinical trials, which will address key scientific hypotheses and therapeutic
questions, which ultimately will prolong the overall survival of MF patients. In order to implement this overall
strategy the following Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1: To identify and credential therapeutic strategies
which deplete or eliminate MF HSCs by directly targeting malignant MF HSCs and/or their interplay with their
tumor microenvironment. Aim 2: To rationally design and rapidly execute preclinical studies and investigator-
initiated scientifically based phase 1/2 clinical trials with embedded biomarker studies, which assess our ability
to attenuate the fitness of MF HSCs through stem cell and tumor microenvironment-targeting therapies. Aim 3:
Actively and dynamically maintain a collaborative translational research network that supports and synergizes
the laboratory and clinical studies led by MPN-RC investigators."

10839925,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (HUMAN PHENOTYPING CORE; HPC)
The Human Phenotyping Core (HPC) and its two sub-cores (Energy Balance Sub-core and Behavioral Sub-
core) directly support the research of NORC members by providing innovative clinical and intervention services
to phenotype humans in mechanistic, clinical, and translational studies. The HPC supports research projects
on “nutrition, obesity, and metabolic health through the lifespan”, which is the overall theme of the
Pennington/Louisiana NORC. The services of t h e Energy Balance Sub-core include methods to quantify
body composition, energy expenditure, carbohydrate metabolism, and cardiorespiratory fitness. The services of
the Behavioral Sub-core include behavioral, cognitive, and psychological assessments; measurement of food
intake in laboratory and free-living conditions; design and delivery of behavioral change interventions; and
assessment of activity and sedentary behavior in free-living conditions.
The HPC has a 15-year history of: a) providing comprehensive services for phenotyping individuals throughout
the lifespan, b) developing, validating, and establishing quality control procedures for innovative phenotyping
methods and interventions, a n d c) establishing a large base of core users. Over the last cycle (years 11-
15), the HPC was rated very highly by NORC members and was exceptionally productive, having supported 94
projects and 194 publications. The HPC also expanded its imaging capabilities and established the
Pennington/Louisiana NORC Biorepository over the last cycle.
The Aims of the current renewal application to fund years 16-20 (2021-2025) are to:
1) provide members with consultation, specialist expertise and a comprehensive suite of innovative energy
balance and behavioral services to characterize human subjects and continue to develop unique and cutting-
edge phenotyping services,
2) promote translational research by supporting “bench to bedside and back again” projects, as well as research
to evaluate the translation and implementation of empirically supported treatments in clinics in the community,
3) provide training on nutrition and obesity research and human phenotyping via the planned Nutrition and
Obesity Research Methods courses, and continue to facilitate pilot and feasibility studies that rely on the HPC,
including use of, and contributions to, the Pennington/Louisiana NORC Biorepository, and
4) expand the data biorepository to include metabolic tissues (muscle, adipose) and biospecimens from special
populations (pregnant and lactating women and bariatric surgery) that are needed for ongoing fundamental and
translational studies of nutrition, obesity, and metabolic health throughout the lifespan."
10839933,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MOLECULAR MECHANISMS CORE
 The Pennington/Louisiana NORC promotes research under the theme of “Nutrition, Obesity, and Metabolic
Health through the Lifespan”. Within that theme, the NORC Molecular Mechanisms Core seeks to facilitate
research progress by providing NORC Members with access to modern biomedical research technology that
typically exceed the capabilities of individual laboratories, particularly those of investigators at the start of their
careers. To understand the molecular etiology that forms the pathogenic framework for obesity and metabolic
disease, technologies that capture gene expression -- the driving force of physiology and phenotype -- are of
primary necessity for conducting mechanistic research.
 Therefore, the Molecular Mechanisms Core provides turn-key access to technologies assessing gene
expression to NORC investigators. These range from systems-biology level expression profiling in complex RNA
mixtures, single cell RNA sequencing to reveal cellular composition and tissue diversity based on gene
expression, to high power microscopy and three-dimensional imaging methods to locate gene products, and
determine where expression changes occur in response to external factors. Together, these methods provide
an integrated mechanistic perspective on how cell and tissue functions are affected by nutrition, obesity, or
metabolic disease.
 The Core offers services built around the general experimental workflow that are organized in three Specific
Aims: consulting services on the experimental design and statistical considerations pertaining to molecular
bioimaging and functional genomics technology (Aim 1); expertise and direct technological support for
experiments (Aim 2); and data processing services and bioinformatics support for molecular bioimaging and
functional genomics experiments (Aim 3). Services in all three Aims are based on the expertise, skills, and
experience present in the Core leadership and staff, strict quality control measures and instrument maintenance,
full transparency in interaction with Core users, and the flexibility to customize protocols to suit the needs of
individual NORC-member projects. As the needs of NORC members change and as technology moves ahead,
the Core seeks to bring new methods online to serve the needs of current and future NORC investigators."
10839942,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM)
The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program is a critical and integral component of the Pennington/Louisiana NORC.
The purpose is to stimulate outstanding research in nutrition and obesity which is aligned with our NORC
programmatic theme “Nutrition, Obesity and Metabolic Health through the Lifespan.” The NORC gives highest
priority to translational research related to NORC theme(s). Awards are primarily to young promising
investigators to help establish their research careers. The selected research proposals receive funds to
support costs of the project plus use of the NORC Scientific Cores. Although the level of support from this
program for each individual project is relatively modest, this type of start-up funding is frequently the most
difficult to identify in the research setting. Institutional commitment of funds to the NORC P&F Program has
been strong and consistent with Pennington Biomedical contributing approximately 50% of the total money put
into the NORC P&F program. We expect to at least keep the current level of institutional support and even aim
to increase it in the next funding cycle (from sister Louisiana academic institutions and philanthropy). With
these institutional funds, the P&F Program has been innovative and supported new initiatives such as multi-
disciplinary and multi-institutional proposal solicitations to stimulate collaboration and has worked
collaboratively with other centers to leverage resources. The P&F Program has operated efficiently and has
yielded outstanding productivity. Overall, from 2004 to November 2020, 58% of all P&F award recipients have
received additional investigator-initiated funding. The P&F grant program is a vibrant part of the NORC, enabling
exciting new lines of research that have resulted in successful new K and R proposals and awards. According to
members’ feedback, the P&F Program is running smoothly and achieving its purpose of stimulating research.
Based on the existing infrastructure, we will now expand the Program to increase the integration of Louisiana
NORC institutions, using committed institutional funds and potentially more philanthropic funding from our
Pennington Biomedical Research Foundation."

10818424,"Many insects pose major health and economic hazards to humans as common disease vectors and
agricultural pests. Almost all of our present understanding of insect phototransduction is based on opsin-based
photoreception in eyes that mediate image forming vision. My lab has recently discovered two additional
phototransduction mechanisms in Drosophila. Cryptochrome (CRY) and Rhodopsin 7 (Rh7) expressed in central
brain neurons mediate rapid onset sustained electrophysiological responses in these neurons. CRY and Rh7
light signaling underlie a novel form of non-image forming vision that strongly modulates complex time-of-day
dependent insect behavioral responses to light, including avoidance/attraction behavioral choice between light
and shade and light evoked arousal. While CRY's mechanism of action is due to light evoked redox state
changes of its flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore and Rh7's mechanism of action is through a G-
protein signaling pathway, they physiologically interact and may form the basis of a true color vision system for
non-image forming vision that discerns specific light spectra. We have extended our study of non-image forming
vision to harmful nocturnal Anopheles gambiae and diurnal Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and find that CRY1s
mediate very distinct time-of-day dependent species specific behavioral light responses in these mosquitp-o
important disease vectors. Remarkably, nocturnal and diurnal mosquito CRY1s confer mosquito species specific
behavioral effects when expressed in all CRY expressing cells in a cry-null Drosophila genetic background and
nocturnal mosquito CRY1 is significantly more light sensitive than diurnal mosquito CRY1 measured by multiple
behavioral and electrophysiological assays. We will determine the detailed mechanisms that confer species
specific physiological and behavioral light responses for flies and mosquitoes and other insects using a highly
sensitive electrophysiological assay that we have developed that will allow us to accurately measure redox state
changes and biological outputs for light sensitive CRYs and functional interactions between CRYs and Rh7, in
combination with behavioral analysis. Our custom designed instrumentation allows us to examine CRY
spectrally driven redox state changes in vivo. Present insect control strategies rely heavily on highly toxic
pesticides. A far more environmentally friendly alternative is to make use of light-based behavioral manipulation
of insects in a species specific fashion to attract harmful insect species to traps or to repel them away from
human habitation. The goal of our research to form a rational basis for designing innovative new LED devices
for species-specific harmful insect control in the ongoing fight against vector-borne diseases."
10842253,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sepsis is the most common cause of death in many intensive care units and represents a major burden to the
US health care system. Despite advances in intensive care technology and mechanical ventilator support,
pharmacological options for sepsis are limited, which reflects an insufficient understanding of host-dependent
mechanisms that underlie this pathophysiological disorder. A wealth of evidence from recent clinical and
experimental sepsis studies indicates that a prolonged immunosuppressive status, due to profound cell death
and dysfunction of lymphocytes, is a critical determinant of sepsis-elicited mortality. Therefore, restoration of
lymphocyte cell survival and functions by blocking immune inhibitory molecule(s) may represent a promising
therapeutic regimen for treating sepsis. In this Proposal, we aim to study the role and mechanism of a
previously unrecognized immune inhibitory molecule called SUSD2 (sushi domain containing 2) in promoting
sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Through an unbiased gene profiling assay, our previous study has
identified a cell surface molecule SUSD2 whose high expression correlated with an immunosuppressive
phenotype in an experimental cancer model. In this Proposal, we observed elevated Susd2 expression in T
lymphocytes in experimental septic animals and patients with sepsis compared to non-septic controls. Genetic
deletion of SUSD2 (Susd2−/−) resulted in a significantly improved animal survival and attenuated apoptosis of T
lymphocytes in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced polymicrobial sepsis model. Mechanistically, our
preliminary studies discovered an inhibitory effect of SUSD2 on interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling, a well-
established pathway essential for T cell survival and effector functions. The goal of the proposal is to examine
the causal effect of SUSD2 on cell death and dysfunction of T lymphocytes in microbial sepsis. We
hypothesize that 1) elevated SUSD2 expression leads to diminished IL-2-dependent cell survival and effector
functions in T lymphocytes, resulting in a sustained immunosuppressive state and worse disease outcome in
sepsis; 2) enhanced activation of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) and BATF (basic
leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor) signaling maintains cell survival and effector functions in Susd2−/− T
cells post sepsis; 3) SUSD2 blockade reverses sepsis-induced cell death and dysfunction of T lymphocytes.
Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of circulatory immune cells will be performed to examine the inhibitory
effect of SUSD2 on T cell response post sepsis at the single-cell level. We will test whether treatment with a
neutralizing anti-SUSD2 antibody reverses dysfunctional T cells isolated from septic patients. Results of these
studies will provide both experimental and clinical evidence to support a promoting function of SUSD2 on
sepsis-induced immunosuppression, which can potentially lead to the development of new approach for sepsis
treatment."

the student body is comprised of minority students with 5% of the student body being Alaska Natives. In fact,
62% of the students graduating from the target majors over the last 7 years were from minoritized racial/ethnic
or other underrepresented groups. The proposed program will support 4 junior and 4 senior students each
year after the first year for a total of 20 students with majors in Biology, Chemistry, and Natural Sciences. The
program objectives are as follows: 1. To recruit a diverse pool of undergraduates who are committed to
completing their baccalaureate degrees and transitioning into a biomedical, research-focused higher degree, 2.
To incorporate the most successful practices and innovations from BUILD EXITO and other undergraduate
research programs into a comprehensive and evidence-based training program for students traditionally
underrepresented in biomedical fields, and 3. To foster interest in and support the transition into research-
oriented biomedical graduate programs. We will actively seek to provide for the trainees the academic
foundation, the practical hands-on experience, the professional development skills, and key psychosocial
aspects to develop well-rounded graduates in the biomedical sciences. The 2-year Biomed U-RISE program
will begin with a cohort-based summer Boot Camp and Orientation Enrichment, a Laboratory Orientation, and
a Research Placement that will prepare the trainees to begin working in the laboratory to gain key experience
prior to the academic semester. The trainees will attend a scientific conference in the fall, will participate in
enrichment activities, and will have a summer research experience at a larger institution. With these

Sleep dysfunction is highly prevalent and disabling across a wide range of neurological and psychiatric
conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (PD), disruption of
sleep architecture has been linked to worsening of daytime motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as
accelerated disease progression. It therefore also marks a major, untapped therapeutic opportunity. However, it
is currently not known which cortical and basal ganglia structures and signals are responsible for disrupting
physiological sleep rhythms in PD. The rationale of this proposal is that identification of the cortical-basal signals
which disrupt sleep architecture in PD is an essential next step for developing sleep-specific neuromodulation
therapies. To date, a critical barrier to progress has been a lack of chronic intracranial neural recordings during
sleep in PD. This urgent need can be addressed by leveraging recent developments in sensing-enabled Deep
Brain Stimulation (DBS), supporting longitudinal, high-resolution, multi-site, intracranial recordings in patients’
own homes. The overall objective for this proposal is to establish the pathological network dynamics that disrupt
healthy sleep in PD and how they are modulated by DBS. Our preliminary work demonstrates abnormal cortico-
basal beta (13 - 30 Hz) and gamma (60 - 90 Hz) oscillations across different sleep phases in PD. Our central
hypothesis is that these pathological overnight neural rhythms disrupt physiological sleep signals, including slow
wave activity (<4 Hz), and induce maladaptive network changes during sleep to impact daytime cortico-basal
neural activity and connectivity. We will use sensing-enabled, closed-loop, DBS devices that are chronically
implanted in a cohort of 16 PD patients, combined with interpretable machine learning techniques, to identify
cortico-basal signal and connectivity changes during sleep disruption in PD. We will then evaluate causal
mechanisms of cortico-basal oscillations by measuring waking connectivity using cortical evoked responses and
through applying sleep-stage dependent closed-loop DBS. Bridging this knowledge gap will characterize the
pathological network dynamics of sleep in PD and uncover key mechanistic understandings linking sleep rhythms
to waking network activity. This will provide a foundation for the development of closed-loop DBS approaches
that can restore normal sleep in people with PD. Following successful completion of the proposed research, we
expect our contribution to have determined the principal pathological oscillatory cortico-basal dynamics of sleep
disruption in PD. The proposed research is innovative, using new sensing-enabled DBS for longitudinal sleep
recordings plus closed-loop neuromodulation to evaluate cortico-basal network models of sleep dysfunction in
PD. This contribution is expected to be significant because understanding the fundamental neurophysiology of
sleep dysfunction in PD represents a critical knowledge gap towards developing precision neuromodulation
therapies for sleep, daytime motor / non-motor symptoms and disease progression in PD, which will also inform
on other neurological and psychiatric conditions."

Proteins in serum and urine provide diagnostic indications of early cancers, traumatic brain injury, and other life
threatening conditions, but are difficult to detect at ultra-low concentrations. While ultrasensitive protein detection
has been achieved using digital (i.e. molecular counting) ELISA (dELISA) platforms such as Quanterix’s SiMoA,
these instruments require specialized and complex optics for single molecule detection, which is difficult to
miniaturize. Solid-state nanopores (ssNPs) now offer an alternative digital sensing opportunity for protein
biomarkers following our invention of Controlled Dielectric Breakdown (CBD) as an inexpensive method for
single nanopore fabrication. Unlike the optical readout of dELISA platforms, ssNPs can provide a completely
electronic solution for low-cost, point-of-care instruments that are needed to bring ultrasensitive diagnostics to
low resource settings. Our proposal brings together an accomplished team with expertise in ssNP sensors,
separations, microfluidics, and molecular diagnostics to solve the remaining technical challenges for
ultrasensitive ssNP-based sensing. We will establish feasibility through a head-to-head comparison to the
Quanterix SiMoA.
The technical challenge of signal amplification will be solved by combining a new immunoassay that transduces
every target protein biomarker in serum or urine to hundreds of 50nt 100 DNA proxies coupled to 60 nm gold
nanoparticles (AuNP). This signal will then be concentrated in a microfluidic platform using ultrathin nanoporous
silicon nitride (NPN) membranes that have a proven capacity to capture and concentrate AuNPs up to 10,000
fold. The proxies will be released from the NPN with UV light and will rapidly hybridize with DNA nanostructures
that give robust signals in a ssNP sensor positioned only a few hundred micrometers away. The combined 106-
fold increase in biomarker concentration will enable the ssNP to process signals from fM concentrations of protein
biomarker in minutes. This novel instrument, which we’ve termed the catch and release for proxy enhancement
ssNP (CRePE-ssNP), will be validated on two clinically relevant biomarker panels of requiring increasing
enhancement factors: 1) urine biomarkers that predict bladder cancer immunotherapy efficacy; and 2)
biomarkers in serum used to detect brain injury. Urine biomarkers will be drawn from the CyPRIT Nomogram
panel which predict bladder cancer (BC) response to an inoculation with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).
Thresholds for this panel are in the low pM/high fM range. Our more challenging application will be the low fM
level detection of TBI biomarkers (UCHL1, GFAP) in serum. Performance in both studies will be benchmarked
against the SiMoA HD-1Analyzer from Quanterix."
10850905,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Young people living with HIV (LWH) in the developmental periods from adolescence to
emerging adulthood (ages 16-28 years), which we refer to as “youth and emerging adults” (YEA), have the
lowest rates of engagement along the HIV care continuum (HCC) of any age group. This poor engagement is
most pronounced for African American/Black and Latinx YEA-LWH, including sexual/gender minorities, those
who use alcohol/drugs, and individuals from low socioeconomic status backgrounds. Yet, our knowledge of
factors that promote or impede engagement along the HCC, and how they operate and interplay over time, is
insufficient, for both limited occurrence behaviors (e.g., HIV care appointments) and repeated occurrence
behaviors (e.g., ART adherence). These gaps limit innovations to policy and health services. The proposed
prospective longitudinal study uses mixed methods and focuses on African American/Black and Latinx YEA-
LWH both with and without viral suppression. The study uses quantitative, qualitative, biomarker (HIV viral
load, drug use), and ecological momentary assessment approaches to uncover, describe, and better
understand factors contributing to trajectories of engagement along the HCC over time, with precision,
including from YEA-LWH’s perspectives. The study is grounded in Social Action Theory, a comprehensive
social-cognitive/ecological model that allows for examination of changes in contextual influences (e.g., action
contexts such as racism and homophobia; self-regulatory resources such as substance use), self-change
processes (e.g., social interaction processes including social networks; motivational appraisals), and action
states (e.g., attendance at HIV care appointments, substance use treatment [as needed], ART re-initiation).
The study’s primary outcome is HIV viral suppression (VS). Two interconnected aims are proposed: to
describe trajectories of engagement along the HCC (Aim 1), and guided by Social Action Theory, to identify,
describe, and understand the contextual influences, self-change processes, and action states that impede or
support the behaviors that comprise engagement along the HCC over time, including YEA-LWH’s
perspectives on these factors (Aim 2). A Youth Advisory Board will be joined by scientific advisors to develop
actionable recommendations based on study findings, which will be disseminated. Participants (N=270, half

10817126,"TITLE: UNCOVERING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MOTIVATION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE WITH
IMPLANTED ADAPTIVE BRAIN STIMULATION
PROJECT SUMMARY
Behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity represent a prevalent, highly-disabling feature of
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and many other neurological conditions, for which treatments are currently very
limited. The long-term goal of this award is to understand the neurocircuitry of motivation in order to develop
precise and personalized therapies for motor and non-motor symptoms in neurological disorders. The overall
objective is to establish the neural structures and signals that underpin motivation in PD. My central hypothesis
is that the human motivation system comprises two functionally distinct frontal cortex - basal ganglia (FC-
BG) circuits that drive behavior: 1) the prefrontal - basal ganglia circuit evaluates rewards and operates in the
theta (3-7Hz) frequency range and 2) the premotor - basal ganglia circuit evaluates action costs, and is
mediated by beta (13-30Hz) frequency signals, with both modulated by dopamine. Therefore, the rationale of
the project is that understanding the neural structures and signals of the FC-BG reward circuit is critical for the
development of effective stimulation therapies for behavioral symptoms in PD. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the neurophysiological signatures of reward cost-benefit
evaluation in PD. Patients with chronically implanted, sensing-enabled brain stimulators will perform reward
cost-benefit evaluation tasks with simultaneous FC-BG recordings, on and off dopamine medication.
Additionally, patients will trigger recordings of neural signals at home, with paired self-reports of apathy and
impulsivity. Aim 2) Evaluate the causal relationship of frontal cortex-basal ganglia structures & signals to
behavior. Spatio-temporally targeted brain stimulation will be delivered to the FC-BG network during reward
cost-benefit evaluation to test the causal role of these structures and signals to motivated behavior. The
research is innovative because it uses a) chronic invasive brain recordings, in patients, during behavioral
tasks that index motivation, b) recordings at home to determine within-subject reproducibility and link to
naturalistic motivational states and c) causal interventions to demonstrate mechanistic relationships. It is
significant because determining an accurate understanding of the neurocircuitry of reward will enable the
future development of precise, spatio-temporally targeted adaptive brain stimulation for apathy and impulsivity
in PD, a major unmet need. As such, Dr. Little has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring group led by Prof.
Philip Starr and supported by advisors Profs. Edward Chang, Wendy Mendes and Joshua Berke to develop a
comprehensive structured training plan involving 1) cognitive-affective neuroscience 2) electrocorticography 3)
machine learning and 4) trial design and statistics. This award will propel Dr. Little towards independence and
expertise in the investigation of the neurophysiology, and treatment, of motor and non-motor neurological
symptoms. It will also provide the foundation for a future R01 application investigating the relationship between
clinical apathy, impulsivity and neurophysiology in a wide cohort of neurological patients."
10802186,"Cell motility is a key step in the metastatic cascade of events, as it enables cancerous cells
dissociating from a primary tumor to navigate through interstitial tissues and ultimately colonize distant organs.
Cell locomotion is governed by cell-matrix interactions, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and cell volume regulation
via the involvement of ion transporters, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). To date, most cell motility
assays are performed in medium with a viscosity close to that of water (0.77 cP). However, the viscosity of the
interstitial fluid varies up to 2-3 cP, and can be further augmented by the presence of macromolecules secreted
not only by resident epithelial cells in various tissues but also by tumor cells. Cancer cell plasticity is a key feature
in metastasis, as tumor cells need to adapt to and navigate through diverse tissue microenvironments presenting
different stiffness, degrees of confinement, viscosity and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. It is currently
unknown how tumor cells sense and respond to (patho)physiologically relevant levels of viscosity. The
overarching goal of this project is to employ a multidisciplinary approach involving state-of-the-art bioengineering
and imaging tools, quantitative analysis and in vivo models to elucidate the effects of extracellular viscosity on
breast cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. This application will test the hypothesis, supported by
intriguing preliminary data, that elevated extracellular viscosity (≥3cP) promotes NHE1-dependent cell swelling,
which triggers the activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel TRPV4, thereby initiating downstream
signaling. In Aim 1a, we will establish that TRPV4 is the key mechanosensor of elevated viscosity, which initiates
RhoA activation, and delineate the presence of a potential feedback loop between NHE1-dependent TRPV4
activation and RhoA. In Aim 1b, we will demonstrate that the coordinated action of local isosmotic swelling at the
leading edge and shrinkage at the trailing edge mediated by NHE1 and potassium-chloride cotransporter 4,
KCC4, respectively, supports confined migration at elevated viscosities. Cells, as active mechanical objects upon
sensing elevated extracellular viscosity, respond by balancing forces in the cell cytoplasm with those in the
extracellular microenvironment, thus resulting in increased cytoskeletal tension, higher RhoA-dependent cell
contractility and actin reorganization, which ultimately precipitate nuclear translocation of YAP (Aim 1c). We will
characterize the roles of viscosity-sensing mechanisms in discrete steps of metastatic dissemination in a live
zebrafish model that affords the unique advantages of optical transparency and exceptionally high-resolution
along with high-speed imaging of transplanted tumor cells (Aim 2a). We will complement these studies with
mouse models to characterize the localization patterns and functional roles of TRPV4, NHE1, KCC4 and YAP in
cell migration in natural mammary tissue tracks in vivo (Aim 2b) and in breast cancer growth and metastasis
(Aim 2c), using triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). In sum, this project
will define how cells sense and respond to extracellular viscosity and identify novel targets to reduce metastasis."
10831966,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hazardous alcohol use has grown substantially in the aging population. It remains unknown whether
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for
diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in classic irreversible dementia. Motivating
the proposal are 1) our longitudinal findings of accelerated aging of selective brain structures in AUD; 2)
results of an animal model of high alcohol exposure in old compared with young, well-nourished male
and female rats; and 3) preliminary results from non-alcoholic individuals meeting MCI criteria compared
with AUD with similar extent of cognitive deficits revealing different age-related patterns of brain
degradation. The findings led us to consider factors of nutritional deficiency and cytokine dysregulation
that occur in both AUD and MCI and have the potential to contribute to common and unique disruption,
accelerated by aging, of selective brain circuitry and cognitive sequelae in each diagnosis.
We will test 180 actively drinking men and women (60 AUD, 60 non-alcoholic MCI, and 60 age-matched
controls) before and after 18-24 months with structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Recognizing mnemonic compromise associated with AUD and MCI, primary hypotheses will target the
integrity of nodes and connections of Papez (limbic) circuit; white matter integrity will be assessed with
deterministic fiber tracking and node-to-node integrity with probabilistic fiber tracking. Causal modeling
will test the influence of specific independent variables of alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex hypothesized to
have direct effects on inflammation and thalamic-hippocampal or cingulate-entorhinal connectivity, which,
in turn, exert mediating influences on episodic memory. In addition to quantification of alcohol use and
nutritional and inflammatory markers, modifiable risk factors to be examined include smoking, licit and
illicit drugs, obesity-BMI, blood pressure, and physical activity. The parallel animal study will focus on the
interaction of alcohol binge exposure and nutritional challenge with graded levels of thiamine deficiency
and resulting cytokine, brain structure and connectivity, and behavioral sequelae in rats.
AIM 1: In cross-sectional study, model for each diagnosis the influence of independent variables
(i.e., alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex) and hypothesized mediating factors (i.e., inflammation)
affecting neurocircuitry substrates of episodic memory.
AIM 2: In longitudinal study, use trajectory analysis to quantify interim change in targeted
neurocircuitry as a function of age. Causal modeling will use longitudinal change data of the
independent variables.
AIM 3: In longitudinal study, determine whether nutritional (thiamine) deficits are sufficient to
produce enduring MR-detectable responses to high blood alcohol levels in wild-type Wistar rats."
10868425,"The Harvard Medical School Department of Dermatology T32 training grant has been active for more than 45
years, and over that period of time has trained many postdoctoral fellows who have become national leaders
in dermatology. Dr. Thomas Kupper has served as Principal Investigator since 2000. There are three
Harvard-appointing Dermatology departments: the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Brigham and Women's
Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital. An executive committee comprised of the chairs of these
departments oversees the Harvard combined residency program, and provides advice and counsel to Dr.
Kupper with regard to the T32 grant. The training grant has two overarching goals. The first is to identify,
recruit, and support promising dermatologist physician scientists interested in a career in biomedical
research. While such candidates most often come from Harvard's Dermatology Residency program, trainees
from other dermatology residencies are eligible as well. The second goal is to support the development of
outstanding PhD scientists who are interested in a research career in investigative dermatology and related
fields. Considering the past decade of the training grant, all 30 of our trainees continue to be involved with
biomedical research, whether in academic medicine or biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies. This group
of 30 trainees has authored 173 peer-reviewed manuscripts over the past decade, with a mean impact factor of
7.9. Over the past decade, T32 graduates have successfully competed for extramural funding as PI's, including
National Institutes of Health K23, K12, K08, and DP5 awards (from the Office of the NIH Director); applications
for K99/R00 and K08 grants are pending. For the next funding cycle, we have retained our External Advisory
Board consisting of eminent academic dermatologists and scientists who will assist with choosing candidates
and evaluating progress. It remains our conviction that Training Grant support for biomedical scientist
postdoctoral fellows interested in skin disease research has never been more critical to their careers, and by
extension, the long-term survival of academic investigative dermatology."
10846749,"Summary
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect millions of individuals worldwide and its incidence is increasing. Both
genetic and environmental factors appear to play a role in IBD development. Genetic studies in humans have
linked the interleukin-23 (IL-23) signaling pathway with IBD, but the environmental factors contributing to disease,
have remained elusive. The rising incidence of worldwide IBD has been associated with westernization of dietary
habits in developing countries, however there is little scientific evidence to support causality. In this application
we will examine the role of a particular group of dietary additives, namely food colorants, to development of
colitis. We have now discovered that the food colorant Red 40, also known as Allura Red AC, promotes colitis
in mice that conditionally express low levels of IL-23 (referred to as R23FR mice), but not in wild type mice. Red
40 is the most abundant food colorant in the world, with annual production exceeding 2.3 million kg. It is widely
used in as red colorant in soft drinks, cherry flavored products, candy, dairy, drugs, and cosmetics. Of interest,
the Red 40-containing beverages, Kool-Aid and the hydrating solution Pedialyte Cherry can also cause colitis in
R23FR mice. Red 40-induced colitis in R23FR mice requires the microbiota and CD4+ T cells. Based on these
and other results presented here, we formulate a central hypothesis that the Red 40 or its metabolites haptenize
bacterial or endogenous proteins to generate tolerance in wild type mice, or colitis in mice in which IL-23
expression is dysregulated. We will study in this proposal the mechanisms involved in generation and prevention
of these responses. Specifically, we will define: 1) if Red 40 and its metabolite ANSA are haptens; 2) how Red
40 induces tolerance in control mice; and 3) if Red 40 or ANSA-specific T cells are generated in R23FR mice"
10833611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chromatin is a massive nucleoprotein complex that packages about three billion
base pairs of genetic information in nucleated cells. Histones and transcription factors
(TFs) are two important families of proteins associated with chromatin that play key
roles in organizing, protecting and activating our genes. A conserved feature among
histones and TFs is the critical role that post-translational modifications (PTMs) play in
controlling their diverse functions. Many gaps remain in our understanding of the
mechanistic roles for specific histone and TF PTMs that are either low in abundance
or where the necessary molecular biological and chemical tools are unavailable for
mechanistic studies. This is especially challenging when studying regulation of the
tumor suppressor p53 that is rapidly turned over by the proteasomal machinery in our
cells. The proposed research project seeks to overcome challenges arising from the
low abundance and heterogeneity of histone and p53 modifications by applying a
combination of chemical and molecular biological tools to generate site-specifically
modified proteins. Specifically, sumoylated histones H2B and H4 and methylated p53
will be generated by new protein semisynthesis techniques. The semisynthetic
proteins will be subjected to a range of biophysical and biochemical assays in order to
elucidate the mechanistic roles for sumoylation and methylation in regulating chromatin
structure and function. Results from biochemical assays will be further validated in cell-
based studies to arrive at a complete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying
gene regulation by histone sumoylation and p53 methylation. The long-term goal of
this project is to identify new biochemical relationships, or crosstalk, in cellular
chromatin that may be controlled to engineer cellular fates and selectively
therapeutically targeted in human diseases."
10850863,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic pain is the primary cause of disability worldwide. According to the National Institutes of Health, nearly
25.3 million Americans suffer from daily pain, and another 23.4 million Americans report significant pain.
Approximately 1 in 5 adults worldwide suffer from pain, and another 1 in 10 adults are diagnosed with chronic
pain each year. We aim to develop dual inhibitors, single small molecules that will simultaneously inhibit two
enzymes: soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The most original and
mechanistically distinct aspect of these compounds is their ability to simultaneously inhibit two different enzymes
that play significant roles in pain and inflammation. Dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors described here have the potential
to be used as a promising novel non-opioid therapeutic strategy in pain management. In our previous NIH SC2
grant (GM135020), we identified several very potent dual inhibitors, and one was tested in a rat model of acute
inflammatory pain. Demonstrating antinociception of this dual inhibitor provided the first evidence that a dual
sEH/FAAH inhibitor alleviates acute inflammatory pain induced by intraplantar injection of dilute formalin. We
also observed that this dual inhibitor produces antinociception at lower doses than the traditional nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen. In the proposed studies, we will synthesize and evaluate novel libraries of
ligands that are designed to interact simultaneously with both target enzymes, assess and improve the drug-like
properties of these molecules, and evaluate whether two previously identified dual inhibitors together with the
new compounds (identified in this proposal) produce pain relief against chronic inflammatory pain in vivo in a rat
model of chronic inflammatory pain.
The compounds we propose to study represent a much-needed, completely novel non-opioid starting point in
pain management research. Because this class has different biological targets from existing analgesics, it
represents an opportunity to solve long-standing problems that have been linked to the existing opioid and non-
opioid therapies in pain management. To our knowledge, this proposal is the first attempt to use the strategy of
dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors as a rational therapeutic strategy for pain management. In addition, the design
principles and synthetic and in vivo tools behind these dual inhibitors are rigorous, comprehensive, and
innovative. This multipronged plan is a forte in our dual inhibition generation/optimization program. Our studies
may provide a foundation for the future investigation of the benefits of using the dual ligand strategy in analgesia.
This proposal represents a collaborative work between two Hispanic-serving institutions, California State
University, Fullerton and California State University, East Bay, with a strong collaborative partnership with the
University of California, Davis. Our multidisciplinary team has the expertise and resources to tackle this project
on the horizon to ensure continued success."
10848206,"Project Summary / Abstract
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates the activity, localization and stability of thousands of proteins
in the cell. By catalyzing the covalent attachment or removal of ubiquitin to target proteins, the enzymes of the
UPS regulate virtually every cellular process, including cell signaling, cell survival and cell division. The
widespread influence of the UPS on biology also has important consequences for human health, as mutations
in components of the UPS cause diseases such as cancer. Encouragingly, the vast number of enzymes and
protein-protein interactions in the UPS are also providing new drug targets to treat disease. There is growing
interest in developing drugs that either inhibit the UPS or harness its ability to eliminate harmful proteins. For
these reasons, mechanistic studies of the UPS have the potential to reveal new insights into biological regulation
and may also help us understand mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and reveal opportunities for therapy.
The focus of this proposal is to discover new substrates of the UPS and to characterize the specificity and
regulation of enzymes that add and remove ubiquitin to these proteins. Although many components of the UPS
are well-studied, we still have little insight into the molecular targets for hundreds of UPS enzymes encoded in
the genome. This study will help fill this critical gap in our knowledge by identifying new enzyme-substrate
relationships and providing new insights into how the enzymes of the system are regulated. It will apply modern
quantitative proteomic methods to identify proteins that are modified by ubiquitin, and how these modifications
change during cell division. This study will systematically examine the ability of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs)
to remove ubiquitin from substrates, identifying new functional roles for these enzymes. The study will also
examine the substrate specificity and regulation of specific ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases,
the proteins that conjugate ubiquitin to other proteins. Together, the experiments outlined in this study will identify
new enzyme-substrate relationships in the UPS and provide new insights into how the UPS controls cell division.
By defining these important regulatory pathways, the findings will provide a framework for understanding how
these pathways are altered in cancer and may provide new targets for the development of drugs to treat disease."

The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) has three aims – (1) to
promote an innovative, integrated, geographically distributed framework for conducting clinical and
translational research, 2) to create new methods and tools that promote research participation, data collection,
and interventions that link the clinic to the home and 3) to develop the diverse workforce needed to catalyze
innovative science throughout populations. ICTS tackles large problems affecting translational science that
require institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research,
developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data,
establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well-
trained clinical and translational researchers. Our overarching goal is to accelerate integration of research into
clinical partnerships around the state and, through team science, bringing our basic, translational and clinical
research workforce together to escalate the pace and breadth of scientific discovery to impact healthcare for
the state and beyond.
Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural
considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to
develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that
overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice
networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize mobile platforms in novel
ways and will test the efficacy of these methods of engagement. As we move research to “IMpact Across
Geographies using Innovation, Networks and Engagement- IMAG-INE” we have created methods to
capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive
data to human health research and outcomes. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national
clinical and translational research systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence
base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance
and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to
generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians.
Through our local, state and national collaborations, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and
translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings."

Influenza, as a global threat to human health, continues to cause significant morbidity and high rates of
mortality. To effectively control influenza, it is important to understand the interplay between the host and
influenza by identifying host factors that regulate viral replication and defining the mechanisms by which
influenza virus manipulates the cellular defense or signaling pathway. Sphingolipids are bioactive lipid
mediators and include sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Although S1P and its metabolizing enzymes, such as
S1P lyase (SPL) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), have been reported to regulate versatile cellular or disease
processes, their roles in influenza virus infection are poorly understood. Preliminary data indicate that SPL
promoted IKKε-mediated type I interferon (IFN) responses to display anti-influenza viral activity. However,
influenza viruses effectively downregulated SPL, suggesting that influenza virus strives to evade the host
defense mechanism. Furthermore, influenza virus increased the level of another S1P-metabolizing enzyme,
SK2, which accelerated influenza virus replication. Inhibition of SK2 impaired influenza virus propagation in
vitro and increased the viability of virus-infected mice, demonstrating the pro-influenza function of SK2. These
findings heighten the need to further investigate the interplay between the S1P-metabolizing enzymes, host
defense and signaling, and influenza virus. The research aims of this proposal include 1) determining the
mechanisms by which influenza virus manipulates SPL and SK2 to enhance virus replication, 2) investigating
the mechanisms of how these S1P-metabolizing enzymes display antiviral or pro-influenza viral activities, and
3) establishing the functions of the S1P-metabolizing enzymes during influenza virus infection in vivo.
Collectively, these research results can define the regulatory functions of S1P-metabolizing enzymes that
impact host defenses and influenza pathogenicity. Furthermore, the project could provide a foundation for
designing new therapeutic interventions to cure influenza."

Adequate diet quality has the potential to promote childhood cognitive health and have a lasting impact on
children’s ability for learning and achievement. My laboratory has identified that lutein, a plant pigment or
carotenoid found in rich quantities in dark green vegetables, is uniquely suitable for supporting childhood
cognition and achievement. Lutein is the predominant carotenoid in neural tissue, serving roles as an antioxidant
across neural membranes. Further, lutein, along with two other carotenoids (i.e., zeaxanthin and
mesozeaxanthin) accumulate in the macular as macular pigment, which is known to strongly correlate with brain
lutein. My work has linked macular pigment optical density (MPOD) – a noninvasive measure of retinal and brain
lutein – to greater childhood cognitive function. However, the cognitive implications of lutein and zeaxanthin
intake in children have not been directly investigated. This proposal aims to establish a causal relationship
between lutein intake, cognitive function, and academic performance. The central hypothesis is that lutein
consumption will benefit cognitive function and academic achievement in preadolescents. I also anticipate that
gains in cognitive outcomes will be mediated by the improvement in MPOD. These hypotheses will be tested by
conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial to examine the effects of 9-month carotenoid
supplementation on MPOD, cognition (attention and memory), and achievement among 8-10-year-old children
(N=288, 144/group). The active supplement will comprise of 10mg lutein + 2mg zeaxanthin. This work will provide
the evidence-base for recommendations to improve dietary practices for optimal childhood cognitive function
and achievement. The proposed research is relevant to human health and the NIH mission because it will provide
novel data supporting evidence-based recommendations to improve dietary practices for optimal cognitive
function and achievement in childhood."
10844520,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric obesity is considered an epidemic with striking disparities by socioeconomic status (SES). There is
therefore a pressing need to identify novel, modifiable risk factors for obesity prevention and treatment in
children, particularly those who are at greater risk. Compelling evidence that is rooted in circadian biology and
our understanding of circadian rhythms, and is supported by emerging work with rodents and adults suggests
that in addition to focusing on how much we engage in eating, activity and sleep behaviors, it may also be
important to understand the timing and consistency with which we engage in these behaviors (i.e., behavioral
rhythms) for obesity risk reduction. Mounting evidence demonstrates that behavioral rhythms that are aligned
with underlying circadian rhythms, such as sleeping during the biological night and eating during the biological
day are associated with improved metabolic processes and weight regulation. Although less is known
regarding how behavioral rhythms may optimize weight regulation in children, findings from related lines of
pediatric research support those with rodents and adults and highlight the potential importance of behavioral
rhythms for excess weight gain prevention. Understanding the role of behavioral rhythms in weight regulation
for children from lower SES backgrounds may be particularly important given that they may be at greater risk
for disruptions to behavioral rhythms due to economic adversity and neighborhood disadvantage, placing them
at increased risk for excess weight gain. Further, understanding associations between SES, behavioral
rhythms and weight regulation in young school-aged children focuses on a time period when a number of
health behaviors that carry through adolescence are shaped and thus may represent an opportune time for
optimizing weight regulation. The present study therefore proposes to enroll 176 children 5-8 years old from
diverse SES backgrounds into a 16-month observational study. Children will complete five 10-day
assessments across the study (baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 16 months) during which the following will be measured:
timing and consistency of sleep (via actigraphy), timing and distribution of eating (via 24-hour dietary recalls),
timing and consistency of physical and sedentary activities (via accelerometry and self-report), timing of the
circadian clock (dim light melatonin onset; DLMO), measures of the home and neighborhood environment, and
anthropometrics (height, weight, adiposity). The primary aims of this proposed work are to assess: a) how
behavioral rhythms affect body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children, and b) how SES affects behavioral
rhythms and thus BMI trajectories. Secondary aims will assess how circadian factors (i.e., circadian phase and
circadian phase angle) and the household and neighborhood environments affect behavioral rhythms.
Exploratory aims will also assess the relative influence of behavioral, circadian and environmental factors on
children's BMI trajectories, including potential moderation of associations between behavioral rhythms and BMI
trajectories by circadian phase and phase angle."
10843966,"Multiple lines of evidence suggest microbial infections are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β
(Aβ) peptides possess antimicrobial activity and may protect against human herpes viruses (HHV). Viral DNA
is also detectable in Aβ plaques, and HHV DNA detected in next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments is
associated with AD risk. Although neuroinflammation is the mechanism assumed to drive this association,
several questions remain. Foremost, it is unclear whether infections precede AD or are the result of an aging
immune system or AD pathology itself. The specific aspects of AD pathology that are affected by infections are
also unknown, as is the role of the host genome in mediating risk. The objective of this project is to answer
these questions by leveraging large AD cohorts with NGS data derived from blood and brain samples to detect
the presence of microbial DNA. Microbial DNA can be detected and quantified in human NGS experiments by
aligning reads that do not map to the human genome to microbial reference genomes, and depending on the
species identified, may be evidence of either an active or latent infection. Any microbe for which a reference
genome is available can be detected. The cohorts include the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project
(ADSP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS),
Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD), and Gwangju Alzheimer's & Related
Dementias project (GARD). The long-term goal of this project is to provide evidence that interventions targeting
microbial infections could prevent AD or slow its progression. Our central hypothesis is that infections increase
AD risk and cause observable changes to specific facets of AD pathology. We also hypothesize that variants in
the human genome mediate these processes. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific
aims. In Aim1, we will develop a pipeline to accurately quantify and match DNA fragments generated by next
generation sequencing to microbial DNA sequences, including inserted viral DNA. In Aim2, we will leverage
longitudinally followed cohorts with multi-omics data to establish a temporal relationship between infection and
AD, and test for associations between microbial DNA and AD-related traits, including biomarkers, structural
brain changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological traits, disease progression, brain
cell type sub-fractions, and cognitive function. In Aim3, we explore the role of the host genome in mediating
microbe induced AD pathology, including testing for associations between SNPs and microbes, and for
interactions between known AD risk variants/HLA serotypes and microbial DNA to predict AD. This project is
significant because it could provide evidence that preventing or treating infections could treat or prevent AD.
The project is innovative because it will be the first to leverage very large AD NGS cohorts, in many of which
the tissue used for DNA sequencing was collected prior to AD diagnosis, and use case-only analysis to link
microbial DNA to specific aspects of AD pathology."

Cancer Center (UWCCC) Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Program is to improve cancer patient outcomes
by discovering new targets, developing new therapies and biomarkers, and translating preclinical research into
phase I-III clinical trials. The DT Program provides translational direction not only for DT members, but also for
the basic science programs within the UWCCC, including GEM, VR, and TM. Our community influenced bench-
to-bedside and bedside-to-bench research enables a greater understanding of mechanisms of response and
resistance which enable the discovery and development of new drugs, biomarkers, and therapeutic strategies.
The DT Program has 56 core members, representing 20 departments and 5 different schools/colleges. Research
impacts of DT members are evidenced by research awards totaling $20.8M in annual direct cost of peer-reviewed
and non-peer reviewed funding (including $5.41M NCI, $5.06M cancer-related other NIH agencies, $3.25M peer-
reviewed non-NIH sources, $7.05M non-peer reviewed funding) and a significant number of publications (1,011
publications, 12% of which result from intra-programmatic collaboration, 31% from inter-programmatic work and
55% from inter-institutional work). Of note, 29% were publications in high impact journals (impact factor > 10).
The thematic aims of the DT program are to: 1) discover and develop combination immunotherapy approaches
that bridge innate and adaptive immunity for treatment of advanced cancers; 2) discover and develop new drug
molecular targets, precision medicine therapies, and biomarkers; and 3) translate new immunotherapeutic
approaches and precision medicine therapies to clinical trials, including phase I-III studies. To address these
aims, members of the DT Program come from basic science, applied science, and clinical departments. This
program has expertise in therapeutic discovery and development across immunotherapy/cell therapy and
precision medicine therapies. Additionally, translational and clinical research DT program members apply intra-
and inter-programmatic research discoveries in clinical trials. DT members are performing the majority of
investigator-initiated early phase studies and advance UWCCC science into phase II and III clinical trials with an
emphasis on diseases that are high priority for our catchment area, including breast cancer, lymphoma/myeloma,
prostate, and head and neck cancers. Finally, the DT program is dedicated to the mentorship of junior

innovation of enabling systems/tools. GEM mechanistic discoveries have yielded prospective therapeutic
targets, which are under evaluation via DT and WARF Therapeutics. Discoveries and translation are achieved
via frequent research and precision medicine meetings, pilot projects, leadership facilitation, and faculty
recruitment. The GEM program hosts 31 members from 15 departments, which includes basic/translational
scientists, clinicians, and data scientists. The GEM program is pursuing three specific aims focusing on cancer
types of importance in our catchment area.
Aim 1. Elucidate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to generate translational avenues in oncology.
Aim 2. Utilize genetic/epigenetic discoveries to advance human clinical cancer genetics and precision medicine.
Aim 3. Innovate unique tools and systems to enable cancer genetic/epigenetic mechanism discovery and
translation.
GEM members obtained $1.9 million in NCI funding and $6.2 million in other cancer-relevant funding in the last
budget year and were highly productive, with 342 total and 125 high-impact (IF >10) publications during the last
funding period. Of these publications, 20% resulted from intra-programmatic collaborations, 45% from inter-
programmatic collaborations, and 47% from inter-institutional collaborations."

 Co-Leaders: Robert Jeraj and Randy Kimple
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Imaging and Radiation Sciences (IR) Program’s mission is to integrate physical and biological sciences with
clinical research and clinical practice to improve cancer diagnosis, therapy, and the lives of patients with cancer.
The exceptional environment within the UWCCC and the IR program provides an opportunity to advance
imaging, radiopharmaceutical, molecularly-targeted radiobiology, and radiation therapy across the translational
science spectrum from basic mechanisms through clinical trials. These goals are achieved through three
connected aims. Aim 1: To develop and translate innovative imaging agents and technologies to improve
cancer detection and treatment response assessments. IR program members focus on development and
translation of novel molecular imaging agents, such as radiolabeled nanomaterials, refinement of quantitative
imaging methods, and development of innovative image-analysis techniques, including advanced artificial
intelligence methods. Aim 2: To develop and translate radiopharmaceuticals for more effective
personalization of systemic radiation therapies. IR program members focus on development of novel
positron and low energy electron-emitting radionuclides and radiopharmaceutical delivery vehicles, combinations
of radiopharmaceuticals with immunotherapy, and the development and clinical translation of theranostic agents.
Aim 3: To develop and translate advances in the management of localized radiation therapies to improve
therapeutic response and minimize side effects. IR program members focus on localized tumor ablation,
combining localized therapies with systemic therapies to target oligo-resistance, understanding molecular
mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance, and reducing treatment toxicities through novel cellular therapies
and by employing unique combinations of imaging and treatment planning to improve the quality of therapeutic
interventions. Notable achievements since the last CCSG renewal include doubling clinical trial accrual
compared to the time of the last CCSG renewal, with many of trials being translated nationwide reflected by
almost 40% of IR members holding leadership roles in cooperative groups. IR members have received multiple
large multi-investigator studies including an Immuno/Radiopharmaceutical P01, a UG3/UH3 supporting a first-
in-human study of cell therapy for treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia and have been in key leadership
roles in the Head and Neck cancer SPORE renewal (favorably reviewed) and breast and prostate cancer SPORE
grant submissions. These productive efforts are well supported: 41 members from 6 departments have a total of
$9.8M in annual direct costs ($3.4M from NCI, double compared to the prior cycle). These research efforts have
led to 897 peer-reviewed publications in the last five-year funding period, including an exceptional 19% in journals
with impact factors >10, with intra-programmatic publications increasing from 14% in 2017 to 31% in 2022 and
inter-programmatic increasing from 12% to 18% over the same time."

 The value of early diagnosis for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is increasingly
recognized. However, available diagnostic tools rely primarily on the manifestation of cognitive symptoms that
interfere with everyday activities, and screening tools to support earlier identification of individuals with ADRD
are lacking. Credit data represent a unique foundational data source upon which machine learning algorithms
can be developed to identify individuals at risk for ADRD and facilitate earlier diagnosis. The strength of the
information signal from credit data for identifying those at risk for ADRD is supported by previous research that
finds, first, that significant limitations and rapid declines in financial capacity are a hallmark of early-stage
disease and, second, that afflicted individuals and their families experience negative economic consequences
during early-stage disease. We propose using a massive database—that we have already constructed—of
credit data from Equifax which is the basis of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel
(CCP), merged at the individual level using a unique common identifier (Social Security number), with
Medicare enrollment and claims data. The data encompass more than 84 million person-years of data in total,
with more than 1.7 million individuals who have been diagnosed with ADRD. Our specific aims are to: (1)
Estimate the effects of early-stage ADRD on a wide range of financial outcomes measured in credit data,
allowing for potential differences in the effects of early-stage ADRD depending on characteristics such as
race/ethnicity, education, gender, and household structure; (2) Apply machine learning methods to our already-
developed massive data base with merged credit (CCP) and Medicare data in order to develop algorithms that
are capable of identifying individuals at risk for ADRD; and (3) Assess the robustness of the algorithm to the
inclusion of newly available years of Medicare claims and enrollment data. The findings from Specific Aim 1
are important for identifying and understanding the specific financial outcomes individuals with ADRD are most
susceptible to during the early stage of disease and will help inform the machine learning models in Specific
Aims 2 and 3."
10809015,"Project Summary
The proposed project focuses on our recent discovery that immunological production of the oxysterol 25-
Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) potently inhibits the cellular dissemination of two globally important bacterial
pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri. The anti-bacterial activity of 25HC is mediated
through mobilization of the accessible cholesterol pool from the plasma membrane (PM). Accessible
cholesterol is one of three pools into which PM cholesterol is sub-divided and this pool regulates cellular
signaling pathways that control lipid homeostasis and cell growth. By first characterizing the molecular
mechanism by which 25HC induces internalization of accessible cholesterol (Aim 1), these studies will reveal
how cholesterol can be rapidly transported in response to cytokine stimulation. Second, we will determine how
remodeling of PM cholesterol suppresses Listeria and Shigella from penetrating the cell-to-cell contact
junctions of the mucosal epithelium (Aim 2). This work will reveal how mammals enhance the barrier function
of mucosal surfaces through cholesterol metabolic pathways and will identify points of weakness in the
mucosal immune system that may be exploited by numerous microbial pathogens. Third, we will develop new
technologies for monitoring cholesterol dynamics in the living organism and use these technologies to
determine the tissues and cell types that mobilize accessible cholesterol in response to bacterial infection (Aim
3). Finally, the physiological significance of oxysterol-mediated immune pathways will be investigated in
mammalian model organisms using three complementary mouse models that disrupt 25HC activation,
production, and downstream activity (Aim 4). Insights gleaned from these studies, which range from basic
biochemistry to mouse models of infection, will explain how the human immune system has adapted
fundamental aspects of cholesterol metabolism to protect barrier cells from intracellular bacterial infection.
Developing new drugs that mimic the molecular activity of 25HC as determined in this proposal would be an
innovative approach to combat human infectious disease associated with pathogens that exploit host
cholesterol metabolism. These studies will also provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of an
important infectious disease-causing agent and also into the biology of the human inflammatory response."
10808173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
T helper (Th) cells are CD4-expressing T lymphocytes that diversify into several subclasses to support distinct
immune responses. Among the diversity of Th subset differentiation options, IL-17A-producing inflammatory
Th17 cells stand out as unique by virtue of their relatively high level of inherent plasticity. Indeed, this subset
that normally functions in mucosal immunity against bacteria and fungi can easily adopt features of other T
helper subsets when environmental conditions change. While this feature can be advantageous during the
clearance of an infection, dysregulated Th17 cell function has been implicated in numerous autoimmune
conditions, including Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Moreover,
Th17 cell plasticity exhibited in the context of inflammatory disease tends to take on Th1-like traits, such as
expression of IFNg or T-bet, that are also associated with increased pathology. In our current funded studies,
we identified a JunB-T-bet axis as a central node in the regulatory network governing Th17 cell lineage stability
versus plasticity. While several regulators influencing the transcriptional program of Th17 cell identity and
flexibility have been identified, less is known about the regulators of the three-dimensional genome architecture
that differs between cell types and states and is a critical determinant of gene regulation. Thus, we hypothesize
that regulation of chromatin confirmation by lineage-specific factors is key to the control of CD4 T cell effector
conversions. Here, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the dynamic changes in chromatin configuration
and the cis genomic elements that govern Th17 cell effector conversions in vivo. To this end, in Aim 1, we will
apply genetic fate-mapping mouse models, global chromatin conformation assays, and epigenomic profiling
tools to characterize the chromatin looping dynamics during Th17 cell plasticity in a mouse model of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We will determine the contribution of looping to Th17 cell
plastic conversion by assessing the role of both chromatin organizing proteins and lineage-regulating
transcription factors. In Aim 2, we plan to determine the cis regulatory network that governs Th17 cell plasticity.
For this, we will apply scATACseq profiling of Th cells in EAE to identify plasticity-associated cis elements. We
will validate candidates for activity and function using novel in vivo high throughput reporter assays and
CRISPR/Cas9 epigenomic screens. This will identify new regulatory networks, regulators, and gene targets
critical to Th17 cell effector plasticity. Taken together, the proposed work will fill an important gap in knowledge
concerning the molecular mechanism governing stability versus plasticity of Th17 cells."

This CAUSE application brings together seasoned clinical and laboratory investigators in inner-city asthma, with
expertise in clinical studies and clinical trials, immunology, genetics, environmental exposures, bioinformatics,
data management, and statistics. The investigators have long track records in implementing multi-center and
single-center clinical trials and observational studies in allergic diseases, including asthma, to the standards of
NIH funded clinical research networks, in conducting NIH fundamental research on disease mechanisms in
asthma and in training generations of investigators in asthma research
In part A we demonstrate that we have the personnel and facilities to conduct asthma network-wide and Clinical
Research center-specific research on inner-city children with asthma populations recruited from the allergy and
asthma clinics at Boston Children's Hospital and from our just completed, as well as ongoing, NIH-funded studies
of inner-city schoolchildren with asthma, allergic diseases and healthy controls. We have a highly experienced
team, IRB-approved protocols for recruitment and clinical characterization of asthma patients and healthy
controls and an infrastructure which includes clinical research facilities, investigational pharmacy services, a
laboratory facility capable of processing, storing and shipping human samples, a state-of-the-art immunology
research laboratory with a 25 year focus on asthma and a data management facility with quality control plans,
and capability to upload data into the NIAID designated repositories and biostatistical support.
In part B our Center specific project draws from previous work on the novel NOTCH4 pathway and airway
inflammation and will draw on an already well-characterized urban school population of asthma patients and
healthy controls. Our overall hypothesis is that NOTCH4 signaling acts to regulate airway inflammation and
increases asthma severity and loss of control in inner-city school children. Our aims are to 1) test the hypothesis
that elevated peripheral blood NOTCH4+ Tregs defines a population of patients whose asthma is driven by an
IL-6 dependent mechanism that confers a more severe or poorly controlled phenotype 2) determine the
environmental determinants of the NOTCH4+ Tregs and how they mediate disease severity and control and 3)
investigate whether regulatory variants that increase NOTCH4 protein expression are associated with more
severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes.
This project will confirm the role of environmental exposures we have found important in urban schools and
homes of children with asthma and that regulatory variants that impact signaling may be modified by novel
mechanistic gene by environment pathways. We will elucidate novel mechanisms fundamental to the biology of
airway inflammation and pave the way for future biomarker driven approaches to inform future precision therapy.
We address a critical knowledge gap in reducing disproportionate asthma burden in vulnerable individuals. We
will contribute extensively to the CAUSE as a CAUSE-Clinical Research Center, with our infrastructure and expertise."
10929936,"Inflammatory dermatologic disease increases in the elderly due to aging-related dysfunctional
cutaneous alterations. Given the aging population of the U.S. and veteran population, it is
imperative to improve understanding and optimize treatment choice for elderly skin diseases. In
this proposal, we focus on atopic dermatitis (AD) of the elderly, an understudied inflammatory
skin disease subgroup with significant disease burden and an estimated prevalence of ~5-11%
amongst individuals over 65 years of age. While the distinct molecular features of elderly AD are
still undercharacterized, it appears to include lesser Th2 and increased Th17 inflammatory
activation relative to classic childhood-onset AD. Increasingly, inflammatory skin disease is
being treated with therapies targeting specific inflammatory pathways (e.g. Th2-directed IL-4Rα
blockade in atopic dermatitis); however, low precision in defining patient-level disease
mechanism contributes to treatment failure. ~30% of patients do not completely respond to a
given targeted immunomodulatory drug, likely because of the pervasive genetic heterogeneity
underlying these diseases of immunological overactivity. The fundamental unmet need in
inflammatory disease is the ability to precisely determine molecular pathology of individual
patients. Identification of patient-level biomarkers in chronic inflammatory disease has been
hindered by A) a greater role of epigenetics (i.e. RNA levels) compared to easily assayed DNA
variants and B) poor molecular resolution resulting from profiling of mixed immune and stromal
cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) define molecular abnormalities underlying atopic
dermatitis of the elderly and how they change with IL-4Rα blockade treatment and 2) develop a
precision medicine approach for choosing optimal targeted treatment for individual cases of
elderly atopic dermatitis, a molecular framework that can eventually be extended to any chronic
inflammatory disease. Our genomics-experienced team is qualified to accomplish these goals
based on our discovery of single cell RNA-sequencing derived transcriptional signatures in
atopic dermatitis and psoriasis vulgaris, as well as successful genetic dissection of other
complex skin diseases."

Overview
Environmental Health Sciences Research for Indigenous Scholar Engagement (EHS-RISE) is a 5-year
summer research training program for Native American undergraduates at the University of Arizona
(UArizona). It is housed within the Undergraduate Biology Research Program, the Department of
Pharmacology and Toxicology, and the Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center. The long-term goal
of this program is to increase the number of Native Americans in STEM fields. The short-term goal is to
develop and retain a stable cadre of Native American students who graduate from University of Arizona with
STEM degrees. These goals will be realized through the intentional construction of a research training
environment that supports and integrates Native values for Native students pursuing a science degree. The
specific objectives of this program are:
Objective 1: Identify, recruit, and retain nine Native American undergraduate students annually for five years.
Objective 2: Develop and expand trainees’ scientific skills and knowledge.
Objective 3: Foster and sustain trainees’ level of engagement.
Objective 4: Embed the program within a culturally relevant environment and learning community.
These objectives will be achieved by addressing each of the eight pillars of the American Indian Well Being
Model in Higher Education within the context of a rigorous environmental health research training program.
Intellectual Merit
EHS-RISE approaches STEM diversity from a non-traditional mindset. Instead of recruiting Native students
into a program based on a Western scientific model, we have built a program that integrates Native values and
builds bridges between Indigenous and Western science and knowledge. It is a model which equally values the
contribution of both epistemologies. In this way, we are advancing STEM workforce diversity and inclusion by
honoring and integrating the impact and influence of Native perspectives and values in science.
Broader Impact
A diverse workforce, in which the contributions of all members are valued, results in greater innovation,
creativity, engagement, and decision-making. Our model supports the development of culturally confident and
scientifically competent Native American scientists who will bring their values and knowledge into the STEM
workforce, thus advancing science and innovation."

This K23 application proposes a research and career development plan for Catherine Hoyt, PhD, OTD to
establish herself as an independent rehabilitation scientist focused on the early identification and intervention
for developmental deficits among infants and toddlers with sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is the most common
monogenic disorder in humans and is primarily inherited by who identify as Black or of African descent.
Complications associated with SCD (e.g., infection, pain, stroke) are common in the first years of life. In our
earlier work, we found that developmental deficits were present in > 50% of children with SCD before the age
of 3 but are none had been diagnosed or referred to intervention services. Further, children whose caregivers
participated in a home-based caregiver education program demonstrated improved test scores on
standardized measures. Thus, when developmental deficits are overlooked, children miss a critical opportunity
for intervention that could improve their developmental trajectory. The American Society of Hematology (ASH)
recommends frequent developmental screening starting in the first years of life for all children with SCD. Yet
few, if any, studies have described the incidence and severity of developmental deficit among children with
SCD compared to controls. Consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, this
research will evaluate children with SCD at 9, 18, and 30 months using the best available developmental
measure, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-4 (Bayley), to determine the incidence of developmental
deficit over the first 3 years of life compared to demographically match peers (n = 100, Aim 1). If
developmental deficits are identified, scores will be shared with the child's healthcare team so they can be
addressed. Based on theory and evidence, the proposed study will also test a multi-component Sickle Cell
Collaboration for Child Development (SCCCD) intervention. The SCCCD combines skilled therapeutic
intervention to address developmental deficits, the Parents as Teachers® curriculum and specific SCD
education. Our innovative SCCCD intervention is adapted from a pilot study and will provide 12 home visits to
caregivers and children with SCD over the course of 1 year (n = 25, Aim 2). Interviews with caregivers who
participated, as well as those who declined, will identify contextual determinants (i.e., facilitator and barriers) to
prepare for future testing and scaling up of the SCCCD intervention (Aim 3). The results from this K23 award
will provide data to understand the onset of developmental deficit in this understudied population and identify
the next steps to conduct a randomized control trial to test our SCCCD intervention in an R01 level grant
submission. These mentored research aims, combined with a career development plan for advanced training
in implementation science (Goal A), mixed methods (Goal B), prospective trial design (Goal C) and
professional development (Goals D, E) will enable Dr. Hoyt to launch a career as an independent scientist."

The hippocampus, a brain structure implicated in spatial memory and navigation, show changes in the course
of aging, mental illnesses, neurological disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Hippocampal dysfunctions
give rise to diverse clinical symptoms, many of which are tied to impairments in attention and navigation. In
healthy subjects, spatial attention and navigation are tightly linked, because mapping the environment requires
attention to one’s surroundings. Furthermore, while navigating, humans and other animals switch attention
between two complementary coordinate systems: a world-centered reference frame for monitoring absolute
position, and an egocentric reference frame for monitoring relative position with respect to obstacles,
conspecifics, and targets. Little is known about neural dynamics that underlie the rapid shifts in attention that
accompany switches between these reference frames—primarily because reliable indicators of spatial
attention are lacking in standard animal models. The proposed research bridges this gap by exploiting the bat,
a mammal that actively controls its echolocation signals to attend to objects while navigating—similar to many
blind humans who use echoes from self-produced sounds (tongue clicks and cane tapping) to localize objects
and navigate indoors and outdoors. Both bats and human blind echolocators attend to objects using their
sonar, generating an ‘acoustic flashlight’—which provides a direct metric of their moment-to-moment spatial
attention. The proposed experiments will track overt spatial attentional shifts while wirelessly recording
hippocampal neurons to study attentional effects on neural activity. The hypothesis to be tested is that overt
spatial attention rapidly modulates hippocampal spatial codes, by sharpening spatial representation and by
switching hippocampal coding between world-centered and egocentric coordinate frames. To do so, animals
will navigate under two conditions: (1) a stationary and predictable environment where animals direct attention
to fixed objects, and where attentional demands are relatively low; and (2) an unpredictable environment with
moving conspecifics and targets, where attentional demands are high and animals shift attention rapidly to
inspect dynamic objects. These predictable and unpredictable conditions will be studied in two different
experimental setups: a three-dimensional multimedia test room where animals navigate slowly, and a 200-
meter, one-dimensional tunnel where animals travel at high speeds. Because echolocation provides a powerful
explicit indicator of overt spatial attention, this research will yield transformative insights into attention-driven
hippocampal dynamics during naturalistic behavior. The findings will offer new insights into neurological deficits
in spatial navigation and memory, yield technological advances in the design of lightweight, miniaturized
assistive medical devices used to monitor patient health, and will shed new light on the neural basis of auditory
attention and auditory-based navigation in blind humans."

 Understanding the neurobiology mediating susceptibility to trauma and stress-related disorders is
necessary for future translational efforts to improve treatment and prevention. This Mentored Career
Development Award proposal is tailored to facilitate the candidate’s training in multimodal assessment of brain
and behavior, in addition to clinical assessment and computational psychiatry approaches, to elucidate the
neurobiology of susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction. The proposed research training plan will build the
candidate’s skills in multidimensional assessment of perceptual (i.e., visual) processing in the early aftermath of
trauma, advanced computational modeling of behavioral processes, and ‘big-data’ modeling approaches for
fusion of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This training is complemented by mentored
training in clinical assessment of trauma-related dysfunction and research program management necessary for
transition to an independent career as a translational neuroscientist. The completion of the K01 will facilitate the
candidate’s transition to an independent investigator capable of developing new neuroscience-based predictive
models and preventative strategies to lessen the burden of trauma and stress-related disorders.
 PTSD is typically conceptualized as a dysfunction of arousal and negative valence systems with the NIH
Research Domain Criteria framework. However, new research demonstrates that neural circuitry of affective
visual perceptual processing, in particular affective visual processing, may be a significant risk factor for PTSD.
Limited work to date has probed affective visual circuitry in the early aftermath of trauma. The proposed research
will leverage state-of-the-art MRI data collection and analysis with computational cognitive neuroscience
approaches to elucidate impacts of trauma on affective visual processing. The project will thus better
characterize an understudied aspect of the RDoC perceptual framework in trauma to integrate visual circuitry
variability in both threat-related processes and PTSD-related dysfunction.
 Previous research in recently traumatized individuals has also not leveraged multimodal data approaches
to establish generalizable markers of PTSD susceptibility. This project will address these limitations by focusing
on perceptual circuits and by integrating pre-existing large datasets of trauma and PTSD with multimodal data
fusion analytics to assess the robustness of observed neurobiological signatures of trauma-related dysfunction
vulnerability. Further, the proposal seeks to use standardized, open processing pipelines to enhance
reproducibility and replicability of observed findings to promote generalizability. The research training plan will
occur at McLean Hospital, the leading psychiatric research hospital of Harvard Medical School. The institution,
and academic culture in greater Boston provides an outstanding environment and access to resources for
successful competition of this proposed Mentored Career Development Award."

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative option for a growing number of patients with hematologic
diseases and malignancies. However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning,
graft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for
subsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop
skin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences.
Despite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even
though >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers
develop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care
setting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to
conduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are
found; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic
exams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote
expert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and
treatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient
activation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically
meaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to:
1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and
prevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a
teledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions.
We hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough
self- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared
to print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of
suspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1)
establish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer
screening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify
facilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT
survivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of
other late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve
skin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations."
10811665,"ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a form of cellular stress that is experienced by our cells both
under normal physiological conditions such as in professional secretory cells and disease states
such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Upon facing ER stress, cells initially attempt to
restore normal function by activating a conserved signaling pathway called the unfolded protein
response (UPR). However, if the stress becomes chronic and homeostasis is not restored within
a reasonable timeframe, the UPR ultimately commits cells to programmed cell death. How cells
make this life-or-death decision remains an exciting yet poorly understood phenomenon. Cancer
cells exhibit ER stress due to their high rates of glucose metabolism and hypoxic conditions
resulting in accumulation of underglycosylated, misfolded proteins in the ER. The ability of cancer
cells to successfully adapt to ER stress and continue to survive has been correlated to their
invasiveness/malignancy and chemoresistance. Thus, to be able to design effective molecularly
targeted therapeutic strategies, it is crucial to delineate the mechanisms that endow cancer cells
with cytoprotection in the face of ER stress. The main objective of this proposal is to investigate
the molecular mechanisms that play a decisive role in promoting cell survival through ER stress.
With the central hypothesis that the pro-survival Akt pathway regulates the UPR to determine the
overall cell fate, we will (A) Aim 1: investigate the role of Akt in regulation of signals originating
from the UPR sensors in response to stress (B) Aim 2: determine the mechanism by which Akt is
activated in a non-canonical manner during ER stress. Our results will potentially lead to important
revelations as to how cancer cells gain a cytoprotective advantage during ER stress resulting in
prolonged survival. The successful completion of our proposal will advance the field in terms of
enhancing our fundamental knowledge of a fascinating cell biological process as well as finding
new and key targets for curbing cancer cell survival."
10839865,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Urinary stone disease (USD) is third most common and painful urological disease in men and women.
Prevention of USD and its associated costs and morbidity requires an understanding of early and late USD
pathogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests interactions between intrarenal crystal nucleation, growth, and
phagocytic cellular responses plays a key but unrecognized role in USD. Studies in vitro demonstrate that
calcium phosphate (CaP) and calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals induce renal tubular and phagocytic cell
secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs; exosomes and microvesicles). These
biomarkers can attract blood or residential monocytes and convert monocytes into pro (M1) or anti (M2)-
inflammatory macrophages (Mφ’s). Observations in experimental animal models and human tissues suggests
that renal tissue monocytes and Mφ’s can phagocytose and metabolize crystals, and urinary stone formers
appear to have increased medullary M1 and decreased M2 Mφ populations. In a hyperoxaluric mouse model,
suppression of monocyte to M2 Mφ conversion significantly increased intrarenal CaOx deposition. Our studies
also demonstrated that urinary excretion of EVs bearing inflammatory markers derived from specific segments
of renal tubules were significantly lower in idiopathic calcium stone formers (ICSFs) compared to controls.
Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that tubular and monocyte derived Mφ populations can phagocytose
and degrade crystals as a crystal clearance mechanism, and defects in these clearance mechanisms could
result in interstitial Randall’s plaque (RP) and collecting duct plugs (CDP) or even grow directly into USD. The
proposed research project is designed to evaluate the role of Mφ’s in RP and CDP formation using a novel
hypercalciuric claudin-2 global knockout mouse model (over 3-24 months age) that resembles the phenotype of
patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria and USD (Aim 1), and to define the frequency and spatial distribution of
monocyte/ Mφ populations in carefully phenotyped ICSFs (20-70 years) with hydroxyapatite, brushite, and
calcium oxalate stones and varying amounts of RP (Aim 2). The proposed innovative study will elucidate the
role of renal medullary pro-and anti-inflammatory phagocytic cells in the development of RP, CDP, and USD
and whether urinary cytokines, chemokines or EVs carrying biomarkers of pro-/anti-inflammatory phagocytic
cells can be used to non-invasively monitor intrarenal crystal deposition. Completion of this study will also
facilitate the formation of a skilled multidisciplinary team including a promising early-stage surgeon-scientist (Dr
Kevin Koo) under the mentorship of an experienced and skilled USD clinical and researcher (Dr. Lieske). The
resulting preliminary data will provide evidence of the effectiveness of our team. This work will also enable
submission of future detailed grant or center proposals that will extend these mechanistic studies, and has
great potential to elucidate underlying pathogenic steps in USD genesis and identify novel therapeutic targets."

Advances in basic science and pre-clinical research have significantly increased our understanding of the
neurobiological underpinnings of addiction. However, there is a need to train investigators who can move
these discoveries from the lab to the clinic. Our T32 fellowship meets this need, by training clinician-
scientists dedicated to translational research in substance use disorders (SUDs). This renewal
application will continue our postdoctoral program which is specifically designed for physicians and
clinical psychologists. The main objective of this program, now in its 29th year, is to provide both the
research skills and clinical expertise necessary to design and carry out independent, translational
SUD treatment research. Our program has graduated 25 MDs/DOs, 3 MD/PhDs and 5 PhDs in the past
15 years and is currently training 4 MDs and 2 PhDs. Our graduates have obtained K and/or R awards,
engage in team-based research, or attain academic teaching or governmental research-related positions.
To provide sufficient support to ensure their success, our trainees are given 2 years of training, and a
third year is offered to those making excellent progress but who need more time to obtain independent
funding. Our well-funded and diverse pool of senior faculty preceptors have extensive track-records in
training physicians and psychologists. Further, we have a growing cadre of junior faculty to provide
additional support. In this competing application we are requesting 5 years of funding for 6
postdoctoral fellows to be enrolled each year. Our training includes: 1) Didactic coursework, including
weekly seminars that provide a comprehensive overview of the SUD field; instruction on rigor and
reproducibility and data science; courses in statistics and research methodology; a monthly workshop on
emerging issues in addiction; a 2x/month seminar where fellows and faculty present their latest findings
or developing projects; a monthly invited speaker’s seminar; and ongoing instruction on the ethical
conduct of clinical research; 2) Research apprenticeship where each fellow works under the close
supervision of primary and secondary senior mentors as well as a junior/mid-career investigator; 3)

10885911,"Project Summary/Abstract
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has experienced significant challenges recruiting
participants in early-stage HIV vaccine clinical trials. Formidable barriers to participation
in HVTN preventive HIV early phase trials, including lack of HIV public urgency, numerous
study visits, long-term follow-up, vaccine induced seropositivity and HIV stigma, have
resulted in significant challenges enrolling participants into these trials. We will co-refine
an existing media campaign, develop, test and evaluate a multilevel communication
strategy to address some of these crucial concerns and strengthen our reputation of
trustworthiness in marginalized communities disproportionately affected by HIV to
increase their enrollment into early-stage HIV vaccine trials. Over the next 7 years, the
HVTN will focus on the early phase trial program to move the field forward and to identify
products efficiently and effectively for later efficacy testing. This will require the
development and deployment of evidence-based strategies to combat misinformation and
to strengthen community engagement. Our team and the clinical research sites in our
Network have forged longstanding community partnerships with diverse stakeholders.
During our phase 3 clinical trials for the US government-funded COVID-19 vaccine clinical
trials we developed new strategies to supplement our community engagement program:
(1) a consumer-driven marketing and advertising campaign; (2) virtual town halls and
listening sessions; and (3) the use of expert panels to review protocols and provide
guidance and direction. We will build on this work to inform our HIV strategy. We
assembled an experienced team of diverse researchers to accomplish the following aims:
1) Identify components of an initial media campaign that impact HIV vaccine trial
registration and develop a multilevel communication strategy; 2) Evaluate the impact of
the multilevel communication strategy on Phase I HIV vaccine trial registration; and 3)
Determine if the multilevel communication strategy generates public engagement with
vaccines and vaccine trials. This project will be the first large-scale communication study
conducted in the United States to improve community awareness of and engagement
with HIV vaccine trial research. It will assess misinformation and engagement with this
strategy to inform current and future HIV vaccine trials recruitment and is expected to
have a positive health impact by establishing robust strategies to improve diversity,
equity, and inclusion in Phase 1 preventive HIV vaccine trials."

The mission of the University of Iowa (UI) Initiative for Maximizing Access to Research Careers
(MARC) program is to develop a diverse pool of undergraduates who complete their baccalaureate
degree and transition into and complete biomedical research-focused higher degree programs (e.g.,
Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.). While the overall diversity of the undergraduate population continues to increase
at the UI, gaps in first-year retention and graduation rates persist for underrepresented (UR) minority
students, economically disadvantaged and first-generation students. The proposed UI MARC program
plan for training students directly contributes to NIH’s effort of increasing the diversity of the biomedical
workforce, ensuring NIH remains a leader in scientific innovation and discovery. To meet this effort, we
propose to transition the successful undergraduate initiatives currently in place in the UI IMSD program
to the UI MARC program. Specific strategies for trainee development outlined in the proposal include: a
mentored research training experience, evidence-based mentor and mentee training, professional
development activities, and access to career counseling. To implement the proposed training plan, we
have identified faculty and staff with expertise in several key areas. These include: undergraduate
researcher training, doctoral training (including T32-based training), mentor training, career
development, responsible conduct in research and reproducibility, science communication, quantitative
fluency, and program evaluation. The UI MARC will continue to embed itself within the institution
working with departments, units and centers across six colleges on campus to increase science cultural
capital of UR students on campus. Successful interventions identified through the UI MARC program
that are found to significantly enhance student researcher and faculty mentor development will continue
to be disseminated on campus and through national networks."
10842440,"Abstract: The glymphatic system is a network of perivascular spaces that function as a waste clearance system,
analogous to the peripheral lymphatic system. Reduced glymphatic function has been a hallmark observation in
aging as well as models of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, hypertension, traumatic brain injury, excess alcohol
intake, and chronic unpredictable stress. Preliminary data shows that acute and chronic pain, and one night of
light all suppressed glymphatic function. This application will use the murine sparse nerve injury (SNI) model to
understand how the brain responds to chronic neuropathic pain. Sleep complaints are prevalent in chronic pain
patients, and chronic sleep restriction increases pain sensitivity in mice. Norepinephrine (NE), which disrupts
sleep and is released in stressful conditions, suppresses glymphatic function. We hypothesize that increase NE
levels in SNI reduce glymphatic function, triggering cytokine accumulation, neuronal excitability, sleep disruption
and pain sensitization in a feedforward loop (Aim 1). Traditional analgesics have been shown to relieve pain in
models of chronic pain. Our preliminary data show that the same agents restore glymphatic function in SNI mice
with no effect on glymphatic functions in control mice. We hypothesize that reducing the severity of pain via
analgesia improves glymphatic function by reducing NE levels, which in turn reduces cytokine accumulation and
excitability and improves sleep quality (Aim 2.1). Yet, efficacy of modern pharmacology is variable in the patient
population, suggesting that while modulation of neural pathways is partially effective, pathology remains. We
hypothesize that neuropathic pain induces a CNS maladaptive response involving reduced glymphatic flow,
inflammation and waste accumulation. Because both natural and mind-body interventions target multiple facets
of glymphatic disruption (sleep, inflammation, cardiovascular disease), we hypothesize that natural supplements
(melatonin and eicosapentaenoic acid (an ω-3 fatty acid)) and mind-body interventions (voluntary exercise,
improved sleep, and acupuncture) will improve glymphatic disruption in chronic pain (Aims 2.2 and 2.3). The
timing of treatment is critical, because the circadian system is integrated into every process in the body including
the glymphatic system, the immune system, and chronic pain. We propose that targeting therapeutics to reinforce
the rhythm in glymphatic function and clearance will optimize the effect of treatment which can be quantified as
an additional decrease in cytokine accumulation and hyperalgesia in SNI (Aim 3). We will time sleep
improvements via increased temperature, voluntary exercise, melatonin, and acupuncture, to the endogenous
rhythm of CSF distribution - high glymphatic clearance during rest, and low during wakefulness. Aim 3 is unique
in that it tests whether efficacy of mind-body therapies, in improving glymphatic function and reducing pain
sensitivity, can change based on when during the day they are administered. Overall, this application aims to
define whether glymphatic activity may serve as a target for complementary therapeutic approaches and also as
a biomarker establishing the efficacy of treatment."
10846580,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hemoglobin synthesis and erythrocyte development are often studied independently, yet their mechanisms are
inextricably linked. Differentiation defects yield immature precursors, and impaired hemoglobin synthesis causes
ineffective erythropoiesis. A common thread of these mechanisms is GATA transcription factor involvement.
Many questions remain regarding how GATA factor networks instruct progenitors to generate vast numbers of
erythrocytes, which broadly informs molecular/cellular biology and hematology. We discovered: 1) locus-specific
coregulator utilization by GATA1 to control differentiation; 2) GATA factor/regeneration-activated enhancer
confers expression of an unstudied sterile alpha motif domain protein that controls erythrocyte regeneration; 3)
GATA factor-regulated zinc transporter switch governs differentiation; 4) mechanism of heme targeting chromatin
genome-wide; 5) GATA factor-regulated solute carrier protein (SLC) cohort transports diverse small molecules
to control erythropoiesis. Our multi-omic work supports the aims to analyze how GATA factors establish small
molecule ensembles that target the genome and regulate the GATA factor to ensure differentiation. Aim 1 will
dissect a multi-component mechanism by which GATA1 and heme control genome function and
erythrocyte development. GATA1 activates genes mediating heme biosynthesis, heme facilitates or restricts
GATA1 function and heme downregulates GATA1. Heme regulates transcription by downregulating the
repressor Bach1, and we discovered a Bach1-independent heme-regulated mechanism. We hypothesize that
Bach1-dependent and -independent mechanisms establish critical erythroid functions, and these mechanisms
provide translational opportunities. Using all heme target genes and a gene-specific approach, we will establish
the mechanisms. Aim 2 will elucidate a GATA factor-dependent small molecule transporter axis that
regulates erythroid differentiation. We hypothesize that diverse small molecules function in GATA factor
mechanisms and discovering GATA factor-regulated solute carrier (Slc) transporters will unveil new dimensions
to these mechanisms. We defined a GATA1/2-regulated Slc cohort that transports diverse small molecules. We
prioritized a subset with GATA factor-occupied predicted enhancers and will elucidate mechanisms that link
GATA factors with small molecule ensembles and differentiation. Aim 3 will test models for how GATA1
instigates a sphingolipid-dependent regulatory network. GATA1-regulated Slcs included sphingolipid
transporters. Lipidomics revealed GATA1-induced sphingolipid remodeling. Ceramide synthase inhibition blocks
GATA1-mediated GATA2 downregulation, β-globin induction and erythroid maturation. Sphingolipid signaling
controls apoptosis, proliferation and migration, high S1P is deleterious in sickle cell disease, and human
ceramide deficiency involves disrupted erythropoiesis. We hypothesize that sphingolipidome regulation by
GATA1 is vital in biology and pathology. We will develop basic and translational insights into GATA factor
mechanisms governing small molecules that control GATA factors, globin synthesis and differentiation."

This application is a competing renewal of the “Specific Pathogen Free 18 Baboon Research Resource”
(SPF18BRR) P40 OD024628. The SPF18BRR was founded with NIH support at the University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) in 2002 and was relocated to the Keeling Center in 2017. The SPF18BRR
has received continuous NIH support since it was founded. The SPF18BRR is the only national research
resource of adventitious virus free olive baboons (Papio anubis) that are available to NIH grantees; intramural
research programs of federal agencies, including the FDA, NSF and NIH; and other sponsors of biomedical
research (private foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations). Absolutely
unique in the entire world, the baboons in the SPF18BRR have an extensive bioexclusion list of 18 pathogens
normally found in other wild and captive nonhuman primate colonies. The SPF18BRR has integrated multiple
disciplines into a program designed to meet the needs of investigators who utilize its resources. During the
proposed period of support, the SPF18BRR will continue to improve the resources it provides to users and
will continue to add new information about the biology and research value of virus free baboons to its website.
Baboons continue to be important animal model for genetically engineered pig xenotransplantation, are the
only NHP model of respiratory syncytial virus and whooping cough, and they remain a very important model
of bacterial sepsis. Additionally, baboons are excellent models of human COVID associated pneumonia, and
they were instrumental in the development of approved vaccines for SARS CoV-2. Over the next five years,
the SPF18BRR will focus on expanding the SPF18 baboon breeding colony to meet current and future
biomedical research needs. The aims of the Resource Core Component address our continued
commitment to expanding the SPF18 baboon breeding colony, we will increase the genetic diversity of the
SPF18 breeding colony, and we will provide SPF18 baboons, facilities, training, and expertise to the scientific
community. The Applied Research Component will include projects to develop methods to train and collect
data from automated cognitive testing systems in socially living baboons; we will also determine a DNA
methylation clock for our baboon colony, and will perform baseline biomarker analysis for a panel of 30
biomarkers for all animals over 3 years old in our colony; and, we will perform whole genome sequencing on
9 future conventional baboon breeders from the Southwest National Primate Center’s olive baboon colony, as
well as targeted genomic sequencing on other interesting animals from the SPF18BRR. The overall goals
of theSPF18BRR are to provide a national research resource of virus free olive baboons; provide
baboon derived biological materials; provide education and training opportunities to scientist, colony
managers, and animal caregivers who want to work with baboons; and to provide investigators with
facilities and expertise to conduct studies using virus free baboons."

This application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposes training and
research designed to provide the candidate with a foundation to establish a successful career as an
independent investigator with expertise in affective, neurocognitive, and neurological mechanisms underlying
eating psychopathology and obesity. The candidate seeks advanced training in three areas, each of which
build upon her prior knowledge and experience with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and emotion
dysregulation in eating disorders and obesity: (1) neurobiological mechanisms of eating behavior and obesity,
including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology; (2) neuroscience of self-control in
relation to eating; and (3) design and analysis of multi-method ambulatory assessment and intervention
approaches. Training will be guided by an interdisciplinary team (mentors and collaborators) and will involve
formal (e.g., coursework, workshops) and informal (e.g., directed readings, mentoring meetings) activities
across the funding period. The research plan harnesses these training experiences and proposes a multi-
method study to examine how biobehavioral self-regulatory processes predict momentary binge eating and
short-term weight change. Specifically, this study will examine the extent to which affect, attention bias to food
cues, and impulsivity (measured via EMA, behavioral tasks, and fMRI) interact to predict real-time binge eating
symptoms and subsequent weight change among a sample of 75 adults at risk for obesity (i.e., those with
overweight body mass index who endorse regular binge eating). Participants will complete interviews, self-
report measures, an fMRI protocol that includes response inhibition and delay discounting tasks, a two-week
EMA protocol that includes ambulatory task-based measurement of attention bias, and a six-month follow-up
assessment to assess weight change. Importantly, results of this research will identify biobehavioral
mechanisms underlying binge eating and obesity risk, which will help to inform novel prevention and
interventions. Taken together, the proposed study will advance the understanding of binge eating
psychopathology in the context of obesity, and will set the stage for the candidate's future program of research.
The training and mentorship provided by the award will further facilitate the candidate's success in becoming
an independent investigator, with particular expertise in multi-method ambulatory strategies to identify and
target mechanisms contributing to eating and weight disorders."
10864980,"Dietary vitamin K is used by the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase to convert clusters of Glus to gamma-
carboxylated Glus (Glas) in vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins in virtually all tissues of the body. The first
VKD proteins identified were coagulation factors; however, the identification of nonhemostatic VKD proteins
has revealed additional roles, e.g. the regulation of calcification. Carboxylation activates VKD proteins by
generating a calcium-binding module required for their function, and a single gamma-glutamyl carboxylase
modifies all VKD proteins. Naturally occurring mutations in the carboxylase cause two diseases: vitamin K
clotting factor deficiency 1 that is associated with severe bleeding defects, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like
(PXE-like) that is associated with mild bleeding but excessive soft tissue calcification. How these carboxylase
mutations cause PXE-like was previously unknown. We studied two carboxylase mutations present in a PXE-
like patient. Analysis of a VKD clotting factor (factor IX) and a VKD protein that inhibits calcification (Matrix Gla
Protein) revealed partial carboxylation due to a defect in carboxylase processivity.
 Processivity refers to the carboxylase remaining bound to a VKD protein until the multiple Glu residues are
carboxylated. We developed a novel assay to monitor processive carboxylation, and found that the wild type
carboxylase shields the VKD protein, i.e. limiting access of other VKD proteins into the active site until the VKD
protein is extensively carboxylated. In contrast, the PXE-like mutants allowed promiscuous access of VKD
protein substrates into the active site, resulting in the production of partially carboxylated VKD proteins. Our
studies also revealed that a single wild type carboxylase binds two VKD proteins at the same time. As tissues
express multiple VKD proteins thought to have widely different affinities, how full carboxylation of all VKD
proteins is achieved is an open question.
 Our long-term goal is to understand how partial VKD protein carboxylation impacts human physiology.
Central questions are whether treatment with the anticoagulant warfarin, which limits VKD protein
carboxylation, generates partially carboxylated proteins, and whether warfarin evokes PXE-like phenotypes.
We will approach these questions using a combination of protein mapping and activity assays to determine
how partial carboxylation by PXE-like carboxylases impacts VKD protein function (Aim 1), determine whether
the carboxylation of a VKD protein is impacted by the presence of a different VKD protein (Aim 2), and
examine the consequence of warfarin therapy and a PXE-like mutant on VKD protein carboxylation and
function in vivo (Aim 3). Results from these studies will provide the first insights that link the extent of protein
carboxylation to different phenotypic outcomes."
10836424,"ABSTRACT – CORE 003: Biomarkers and Product Evaluation Core
The goal of the Biomarkers and Product Evaluation Core is to facilitate the research proposed in Project
MARVEL by providing data on biomarkers of exposure and biological effects as well as to characterize
commonly used vaping products. These data will allow individual projects to achieve their Specific Aims. The
measurement of toxicant and carcinogen metabolites in body fluids of people who use tobacco products is the
accepted method for objective assessment of exposure to these products. Total nicotine equivalents (TNE),
the sum of nicotine and six nicotine metabolites accounts for >85% of the nicotine dose, is a well-established
biomarker of nicotine exposure. The primary pathway of nicotine metabolism is cytochrome P450 2A6
(CYP2A6)-catalyzed C-oxidation, which leads to the formation of cotinine. Cotinine is further metabolized, also
by CYP2A6, to 3'-hydroxycotinine. The ratio of 3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine in plasma or saliva (referred to as
the NMR) is an excellent phenotypic measure of CYP2A6 activity, and may be used to characterize individual
differences in nicotine metabolism. Urinary concentrations of the acrylonitrile mercapturic acid, 2-cyanoethyl-
mercapturic acid (CEMA) is from 100 to more than 400 times higher in smokers compared to non-smokers and
can be used to distinguish combustible from non-combustible tobacco use with sensitivity and specificity
>99%. The mercapturic acids of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and benzene, 3-hydroxypropyl-mercapturic acid
(3HPMA), 3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercpturic acid (HMPMA), S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA) can be used
to quantify exposure to volatile toxicants in cigarette and e-cigarette users. Oxidative damage can be
measured with urinary 8-iso-PGF2α, an F2-isoprostane and elevated PGE-M, a prostaglandin-E2 metabolite is
a biomarker of inflammation. Vaping products may vary widely in their fluid constituents and generated aerosol.
The Core will analyze saliva samples from Lab Study participants for cotinine and the NMR. Urine samples
from participants attending lab-based assessments will be analyzed for TNE, mercapturic acids, 8-iso-PGF2α
and .PGE-M. The Core will also determine e-liquid constituents and generated aerosol yield of the most
abundantly used e-cigarettes among the participants of this study. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Characterize
individual differences in nicotine metabolism and exposure in participants in the cohort study; 2) Quantify
exposure to other constituents found in tobacco products and systemic indices of oxidative stress and
inflammation in participants of the lab-based assessments; 3) Characterize toxic constituents in e-liquids and
aerosol. The Core is housed at the University of Minnesota which provides state-of-the-art expertise and
technology for the quantitation of these biomarkers, and the constituents of e-cigarettes. The University of
Minnesota is widely recognized as one of the leading academic centers for this research. Objective verification
of product characteristics, user exposure, and biological effects is a critically important component of robust
research on the health effects of tobacco products."

The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Prostate SPORE seeks to improve the understanding
and treatment of prostate cancer using a highly translational approach. The application consists of three
Projects, three Cores, a Developmental Research Program and a Career Enhancement Program. The
SPORE infrastructure will facilitate interactions and collaboration within our thriving community of basic,
clinical, and population science researchers dedicated to prostate cancer research. Each project addresses
a fundamental challenge that contributes to prostate cancer morbidity and mortality. Project 1 leverages
tumor specimens from patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapies to
understand how tumors respond and resist acute potent androgen receptor blockade and to develop novel
strategies to improve cure rates and combat resistance. Project 2 will develop innovative strategies to target
the epigenome in later stages of advanced castration resistant prostate cancer and will develop a first-in-field
clinical trial focused on co-targeting EZH2 and PARP. Project 3 delves deep into biomarkers in localized
prostate cancer, leveraging innovations in computation and biologically-guided deep learning, to deliver on
precision cancer medicine in this disease state. The ability to understand why some localized prostate
cancers are phenotypically aggressive and predict which localized prostate cancers will behave in this
manner addresses a large clinical unmet need. Each of these projects combines elegant preclinical work with
innovative clinical studies led by DF/HCC investigators. Core A, the Administrative Core, will be the center for
scientific, fiscal and administrative oversight. It will lead efforts in planning and communication, and also
house the Patient Advocacy Committee. Core A will ensure that the DF/HCC infrastructure supports the
SPORE clinical and translational research efforts. Core B, the Biostatistics and Computational Biology core,
will provide specialized expertise in biostatistics and the management of genomic and other next generation
sequencing data and data sharing. Core C, the Biospecimen and Pathology Core, will maintain tissue/blood
repositories for the SPORE projects as well as other investigators within the prostate cancer program. It will
provide critical expertise and pathology services including next generation molecular assays and will help
facilitate the use of fresh tumor specimens including rapid autopsies for patient derived model development
to accelerate translational investigation. The Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs
will identify and fund innovative projects that address basic, translational, and clinical research questions and
unmet needs in prostate cancer and will support early career and new prostate cancer investigators. These
programs will actively recruit and retain researchers from diverse backgrounds to foster cutting-edge and
impactful prostate cancer translational science. We anticipate that the DF/HCC Prostate SPORE will make
substantial scientific discoveries in the field and translate directly into benefits for men with prostate cancer."
10916197,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Localized high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) comprises ~15% of newly diagnosed localized PCa, and the cure rate
for these tumors after primary surgical treatment by radical prostatectomy (RP) is low, with recurrent disease in
up to ~50%. Neoadjuvant trials for these localized high-risk PCa may provide valuable opportunities to increase
cure rates and our understanding of response and resistance. However, previous studies of neoadjuvant
androgen deprivation using GnRH agonists alone have generally shown infrequent pathological complete
responses (pCRs) and have not shown evidence of clinical efficacy. We have hypothesized that responses to
neoadjuvant ADT have been limited due to substantial residual androgen in the prostate, and that more intensive
neoadjuvant androgen signaling inhibition (ASI) therapy, in addition to increasing pCR rates, will translate into
an improvement in disease free survival (DFS) and ultimately overall survival (OS). We have been testing this
hypothesis in a series of phase 2 trials examining the efficacy of neoadjuvant intensive ASI using leuprolide in
combination with abiraterone (ABI) and/or enzalutamide (ENZ) or apalutamide (APA) for 6 months prior to radical
prostatectomy (RP). Responses appear to be improved relative to previous neoadjuvant trials, but it remains
unclear whether the cases with pCR/MRD reflect tumors that have less metastatic potential. Moreover, the
molecular basis for residual disease in prostate, and its relationship to metastatic disease in patients who
progress, remain to be determined. To address the genomic basis of response versus resistance, we propose
comprehensive genomic analyses of tumors with exceptional responses (pCR/MRD) to intensive neoadjuvant
ASI therapy, and of residual disease in RP specimens in men who do not achieve pCR/MRD (Aim 1). These
studies will leverage samples from our previous trials, as well as a large multicenter phase 3 study of neoadjuvant
GnRH agonist/antagonist combined with APA in comparison with GnRH agonist/antagonist alone (PROTEUS
trial, supported by Janssen, NCT03767244). Aim 2 will identify actionable acute nongenomic adaptations that
mediate initial resistance to intensive ASI therapy, and specifically test the hypothesis that these adaptations
converge on expression of D cyclins and activation of CDK4/6 to drive proliferation. Aim 3 is a randomized phase
2 trial of intensive ASI (leuprolide plus darolutamide), alone or in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor
abemaciclib. Our long-term goal is to establish neoadjuvant trials as a platform for assessing the efficacy of novel
combination therapies in castration-sensitive PCa."

10877905,"Abstract
Genomic testing has become integrated into cancer care. Physicians routinely order tumor sequencing
analyzing hundreds of genes to identify options for personalized treatment. Unfortunately, there is evidence
that members of the oncology clinical care team may not have the knowledge and skills to effectively utilize
genomic data. Pathologists play a key role in tumor genomic testing and, since 2012, the Training Residents in
Genomics (TRIG) Working Group, a multi-organizational committee, has developed and implemented a
national pathology resident cancer genomics curriculum. Using a similar model, the Undergraduate Training in
Genomics (UTRIG) Working Group has developed a medical student curriculum. Through NCI R25 funding,
there has been remarkable progress with over 50 innovative international team-based learning (TBL)
workshops for over 2000 participants, creation of online resources and novel use of national resident in-service
exams to gauge progress in genomics curriculum implementation. To continue to ensure adequate pathology
resident and medical student cancer genomics education, and given the rapidly changing field, a major aim of
this grant renewal application is to revise, evaluate and further promote the TRIG and UTRIG curricula through
annual workshops including distribution of enduring materials. Another major proposed objective is to adapt the
TRIG model to a critical group of cancer care providers, oncology fellows. Working with the American Society
of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and their Oncology Training Program Committee, oncology fellowship program
directors partnering with local site genomic oncology experts will be taught, through annual train-the-trainer
sessions, how to implement an expert-developed genomic oncology fellow curriculum. The program directors
will then implement the curriculum with their fellows with support from an online community platform. A
structured and rigorous evaluation process will allow continued improvement of the pathology resident, medical
student and oncology fellow curricula and workshops."
10843123,"Project Summary
Movement is vital for health and quality of life, and the need for movement science and rehabilitation research
is increasingly apparent. A primary goal of the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, nested
within NICHD, is to bring the health-related problems of people with physical disabilities to the attention of
America's best scientists in order to capitalize upon the myriad advances occurring in the biological,
behavioral, and engineering sciences. The purpose of this training program in Movement Science is to
prepare pre- and postdoctoral investigators who can integrate knowledge from basic and clinical sciences to
answer relevant questions concerning movement and movement dysfunction as they relate to rehabilitation.
The training program, while administratively housed within the Program in Physical Therapy, is strongly
interdisciplinary, interfacing with engineering, neuroscience, radiology, orthopaedic surgery, and other medical
disciplines. Our training program utilizes the expertise of outstanding investigators from throughout
Washington University to provide interdisciplinary guidance in academic and research activities. The
curriculum is built on the concept of the movement system and encompasses three core areas: biocontrol,
biomechanics, and bioenergetics. The engagement of established investigators with an interest in integrating
basic science and clinical manifestations of disease and injury results in the production of top quality,
interdisciplinary research in rehabilitation.
This training grant provides essential support for this Movement Science training program, facilitating
continuous innovation and exceptional training. Our trainees are highly successful, with an average of ≥ 6
peer-reviewed publications during their training. Average time to completion is 4.6 years in the full-time,
predoctoral program, which has a graduation rate of 97%. Our graduates go on to academic (>90%) or
industry positions, and become nationally and internationally recognized leaders. The training grant is moving
into its 27th year and this application requests funding for years 28-32. In this application, we demonstrate the
impact of this T32 on the field of rehabilitation. We share how the T32 continues to be the driving force behind
innovation in interdisciplinary PhD training, with important changes this cycle related to: 1) formal coursework
and credit hours required for the degree, 2) qualifying examination procedures, 3) trainee – faculty interactions

10839943,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein is the molecular hallmark of a highly lethal subset of undifferentiated
sarcomas that affects children, adolescents, and young adults (AYA). We have recently revealed critical
transcriptional programs downstream of CIC-DUX4 that drive malignant phenotypes, including tumor growth
and metastasis. Additionally, recent studies demonstrate that Capicua (CIC) protein expression is directly
modulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. The long-term goal of our
laboratory is to identify and dissect the critical molecular pathways that regulate fusion oncoprotein stability and
expression in human sarcoma. Our studies will reveal fusion oncoprotein-specific vulnerabilities that can
facilitate precision-based therapeutic design to improve outcomes for patients with universally lethal forms of
sarcomas. The objective of this proposal is to fuse our expertise in Capicua (CIC) biology and MAPK signaling
to develop the first precision-based therapeutic approach for CIC-DUX4 sarcomas. We hypothesize, that
genetic or pharmacologic MAPK activation will lead to the degradation of the CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein. Our
rationale is based on our prior studies demonstrating MAPK-mediated regulation of wild-type (non-fused) CIC
protein expression in the context of human cancer. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1)
human ERK physically interacts with nuclear CIC-DUX4; (Aim 2) MAPK-ERK pathway activation decreases
CIC-fused oncoprotein stability, leading to degradation; and (Aim 3) pharmacologic activation of the MAPK
pathway decreases tumor cell survival through rapid degradation of the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein. The
significance of these findings are highly impactful, as there are no effective therapeutic strategies to target CIC-
DUX4 sarcomas, which remain lethal in the metastatic setting. Our proposal is innovative because we are
leveraging our expertise in MAPK-signaling, transcription factor fusions, and Capicua biology to develop a
precision-based therapeutic approach to directly target and degrade a lethal fusion oncoprotein in sarcoma, an
unmet scientific and clinical need."

Pelvic organ tumors in men and women are projected to account for 40% and 18%, respectively, of new cancers
diagnosed, and 31% and 26%, respectively, of cancer related deaths in the United States in 2020, according to
the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts & Figures 2020. While nearly half of all pelvic cancer patients
receive radiation therapy, the dose is limited and fractionated over weeks due to the potential for developing
radiation cystitis. This is a debilitating secondary condition that can lead to disruption of the urothelium,
inflammation, neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), hemorrhagic cystitis and chronic fibrosis that may require
a cystectomy. Current therapies such as cystoscopic fulguration, intravesical formalin and hyperbaric oxygen
are often ineffective and focus on restricting hemorrhage rather than urological consequences. Thus, there is a
critical need for preclinical models to better understand the pathophysiology of radiation cystitis, design novel
mechanistic approaches in its prevention and treatment and non-invasive monitoring of these outcomes using
clinically viable imaging methods. In our mouse models, bladders are either externalized or instilled with an
infrared dye for selective irradiation (10Gy; 1Gy=100rad) to cause radiation cystitis with an acute phase (1-
3days) characterized by urothelial cell (UC) apoptosis and disruption of barrier function, and a chronic phase
(8wks) with inflammation, afferent sensitization, NDO, and eventually collagen deposition, fibrosis and
decreased bladder wall compliance. We propose to test mechanistically different classes of therapeutic and
contrast agents for which we have strong preliminary data: 1) Mitochondrial targeted free radical scavenger,
XJB-5-131, to decrease reactive oxygen species that inhibit mitophagy; 2) p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR)
modulator, LM11A-31, to decrease urothelial cell apoptosis and barrier disruption; 3) soluble guanylyl cyclase
(sGC) activator, cinaciguat, to decrease inflammation, afferent sensitization and collagen deposition to treat NDO
and fibrosis; and 4) intravesical infrared dye and novel contrast media mixture, gadobutrol/ferumoxytol, to
selectively irradiate the bladder within the abdomen and to enhance the capabilities of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) for non-invasive assessment of fibrosis in the bladder wall, respectively. As LM11A-31 and
cinaciguat have passed phase 1 clinical safety trials for non-urological pathologies, they have considerable
clinical relevance in the prevention and treatment of radiation cystitis. The overall goals of the proposal are to
better characterize the pathophysiology of radiation cystitis and to design clinically relevant treatment protocols
utilizing the proposed agents individually or in combination. Progress toward this goal will be monitored using
decerebrate or awake (telemetric) cystometrogram (CMG) recordings, MRI, histological and molecular
approaches, mitophagy reporter (mt-keima) mice, and conditional knockout mice for NADPH cytochrome b5
reductase 3 (CyB5R3) in smooth muscle or nerves which renders sGC unresponsive to NO• in these cells."

Molecular Imaging of Ectopic Calcification. The formation of calcified, insoluble deposits is not just a
bystander or epiphenomenon, but rather plays key roles in the pathology of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and probably other diseases of aging. Calcium deposits in the eye
between the Bruch’s membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium nucleate the formation of drusen, long
associated with AMD, and in some cases predict progression to advanced disease. Moreover in AD brains,
phosphorylated Tau is observed associated with intracellular calcification in neurons. Understanding the
calcification processes in these diseases has been hampered by the limitations of existing fluorescent stains,
particularly for studying the development of calcification in the tissues of live animal models of these diseases,
especially outside the retina. While techniques like computed tomography (CT), Positron Emission
Tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) all offer good tissue penetration, they offer only
millimeter resolution at best, and modest specificity. The thrust of this Project is to develop improved
luminescent sensors that overcome the shortcomings of the existing sensors. In particular, we will develop
sensors with tunable selectivity and kinetics, altered transduction (response), and improved targetability, that
permit detection of microscopic calcification even deep in perfused tissue. These novel sensors will be
supplied to our Projects to enable them to carry out unprecedented experiments in cells, tissues, and live
animal models of AMD, AD, and other diseases. In particular, we will develop sensors to study the continuous
development of calcification in animal models of ectopic calcification diseases such as Pseudoxanthoma
Elasticum (PXE) and Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI), that are capable of optically
distinguishing different chemical forms of calcification. We also will develop sensors for following calcification in
cells and subcellular organelles. Our goals in this Project are not only to develop improved tools to elucidate
the calcification processes in cellular and live animal models, but also to identify and test new therapeutic
approaches. We note that other diseases exhibiting calcification phenotypes such as atherosclerosis, heart
valve disease, and breast cancer, may also benefit from these developments."
10878735,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Mechanisms of extra- and intra-cellular calcification. Recent findings from our laboratory showed that
extracellular calcification is an integral part of the hallmark lesions of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Calcified deposits rich in the calcium phosphate mineral hydroxyapatite (HAP) accumulate in the space under
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the back of the eye, where nutrient uptake and clearance of unwanted
material usually are exchanged between the blood circulation and the RPE cells. Inhibition of this exchange
process can lead to rapid progression to an end-stage disease characterized by irreversible visual loss. Apart
from AMD, sub-RPE deposit formation is also associated with other diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Based on recent findings, we proposed a new model for sub-RPE deposit initiation and growth where
calcification plays a pivotal role. We know from clinical and basic science studies that calcification, and the
associated interactions with proteins and lipids, have a negative effect on disease progression. We also
learned that understanding how different mineralization forms contribute to diseases is critical. However, we do
not yet know how calcification occurs and what intra- and extracellular molecules and pathways contribute to
mineral deposition in the sub-RPE space. This project will study the cellular and systemic contributors to
extracellular mislocalized (ectopic) calcification using a cellular model system we developed to study the
initiation and progression of the mineral-laden sub-RPE deposits. We will also develop a significantly improved,
new 3D microfluidic cell model to study calcification, as sub-RPE deposit formation, development and
progression of AMD and AD are linked to the choroidal endothelium and its degeneration. The results will be
validated using human postmortem eye tissues from patients with AMD and AD. The validation and the
experimental plan using the 2D and 3D cell culture systems will provide a robust foundation for developing new
intervention strategies centered on the calcification of the sub-RPE deposits. Apart from AMD and AD, these
treatment strategies will also be applicable for other diseases in which sub-RPE deposits play a role."
10878738,"PROJECT 4 SUMMARY
Mechanisms of pyrophosphate dysregulation. Hydroxyapatite deposition in bones and teeth is a carefully
orchestrated biochemical process aimed at balancing the concentrations of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a
potent calcification inhibitor, and the local concentrations of phosphate (Pi), a calcification promoter, to
establish a proper PPi/Pi ratio to enable regulated tissue mineralization to take place. While we have a good
understanding of what molecules control physiological skeletal and dental mineralization, limited data exists as
to whether alterations in those same mechanisms lead to ectopic calcification in the eyes, brain, and
vasculature in diseases of aging such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Alzheimer's disease (AD)
and atherosclerosis. AMD is clinically characterized by the presence of extracellular deposits known as drusen,
located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroidal microvasculature in the area known as
the Bruch’s membrane in the macular region. Drusen is also observed in the normal aging eye associated with
local inflammation, and the presence of a high number of large drusen in the macular region is a significant risk
factor for developing AMD. While there are no murine models that fully reflect the pathophysiology of human
AMD, the Abcc6-/- and the Enpp1-/- mouse models of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and generalized
arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) respectively, manifest not only vascular and brain calcification but also
calcifications in the eyes and therefore these mouse models can be used as surrogates to understand drusen
formation. In this PO1 component we will test the overarching hypothesis that dysregulation of the PPi/Pi ratio
underlies the pathophysiology of ectopic calcification in diseases of aging, focusing our studies primarily on
eye calcification. Given that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is the major pyrophosphatase
controlling the PPi/Pi ratio, TNAP may be a useful druggable target for the prevention/amelioration of drusen
formation. Thus, the goals of this Project 4, designed to be mutually supportive with the other PO1
components, are to probe the causative role of PPi dysregulation in eye calcification by genetically
manipulating the production and degradation of PPi in vivo. We will investigate if the PPi/Pi ratio is being
controlled (either in the choroid endothelium, RPE cells or both compartments) via the production and function
of a special type of extracellular vesicles known as matrix vesicles (MVs), where hydroxyapatite starts to form
during physiological skeletal/dental mineralization, or if this ratio is controlled via the pathophysiological
upregulation of TNAP activity alone. We will also conduct pharmacological proof-of-concept studies aimed at
affecting calcification in the eye via modulating the production and degradation of systemic and local PPi
concentrations. Completion of these studies, within the context of this multi-disciplinary team effort, will lead to
novel insights into the interrelated pathophysiology of AMD, AD and vascular calcification and will validate a
druggable pathway to address the unmet clinical need of treating/preventing ectopic calcification manifesting in
these highly prevalent diseases of aging."

This is an application for continued funding for the Vision Training Grant (VTG) at the University
of Washington which includes 26 preceptors in seven Departments and six Interdepartmental
Programs. Our goal is to train the next generation of independent vision scientists to
communicate and access techniques broadly across vision sub-fields, and to appreciate the
links between fundamental and clinical research with the aim of developing treatments for
diseases of the visual system. Funds are requested to provide training for four pre- and two
postdoctoral trainees in the effective communication of scientific principles to a broad audience,
in grant-writing as a pathway to independence, and to provide exposure to a broad range of
topics and techniques in vision research ranging from individual proteins and molecules to
systems-level neuroscience and cognition. Trainees will participate in monthly discussion
sessions where a wide variety of topics including rigor and reproducibility in research, effective
data presentation, grant-writing, ethics and alternative career options will be discussed.
Trainees will present their work twice each year, attend VTG seminars and participate in VTG
lunches with visiting speakers, prepare an independent grant for submission and participate in
training for responsible conduct, and rigor and reproducibility in research. Postdoctoral trainees
are also required to participate in “Hit the Ground Running”, a mentoring program for postdocs.
Trainees will also receive mentorship related to the successful completion of research projects
and options for alternative careers. Predoctoral trainees will be supported for two years and
postdoctoral trainees for one year. The VTG is currently the only source of support for pre- and
post-doctoral trainees who want to commit to biomedical research in Vision and Ophthalmology.
As metrics of trainee outcome, we note that over the past two 5-year epochs, 36 of 38 trainees
have remained in research careers and 16 have won independent grants following their VTG
period. This includes 14 from the NIH (NRSA/K99). In summary, the VTG community at UW has
a demonstrated record of success in training; we have 26 preceptors with secure funding and
strong mentoring skills pursuing a wide range of research problems in Vision. We have large
predoc and postdoc populations that can benefit from the additional, dedicated vision training
supported by the T32. For the upcoming cycle, we request an increase in the number of predoc
slots from 2 to 4, and a continuation of 2 postdoc slots."

Bladder cancer (BC) is 3-5 times more common in men even when adjusted for environmental factors such as
smoking, the primary risk factor for this disease. The goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to advance our
knowledge of “sex as a biological variable (SABV)” in BC, with the ultimate objective of improving patient
outcomes by discovering sex-specific drivers that can be targeted therapeutically. Benchmarks of Success and
Impact for the Program include identification of key immunological, hormonal, chromosomal, genetic, and
epigenetic pathways responsible for sex-driven biological phenotypes in BC to inspire the design of a novel line
of BC therapeutics based on each patient’s biological sex. To this end, the PPG will unite three leading
laboratories in their respective fields, each tackling the problem of SABV from a unique and complementary
standpoint of expertise: immunology, cancer biology/functional genomics, and epigenetics. These three research
groups, supported by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Cancer Center and the Ohio State University Comprehensive
Cancer Center, have a proven history of collaboration, with nine joint publications since 2017 and multiple co-
authored papers in the pipeline. Project 1 aims to uncover the immunological basis of sex differences in BC,
taking advantage of a recent discovery in T cell intrinsic androgen receptor signaling in CD8+ T cell exhaustion.
Project 2 will focus on the role of the Y chromosome and the Y-lined epigenetic regulators in driving BC
progression and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB); and Project 3 will investigate tumor
suppressing activity of the X chromosome-linked epigenetic regulator and the roles of androgen and estrogen-
dependent sex hormone pathways, aiming to elucidate the epigenetic basis of sex differences in BC. All three
Projects will be supported by an Administrative Core (Admin Core) and two shared resource Cores – the
Systems Pathology Core (Core 1) and the Data Science Core (Core 2). Admin Core will manage and support
the entire program by offering administrative and fiscal management support and facilitating communication and
scientific interactions. Core 1 will provide state-of-the-art digital pathology services, automated and personalized
image analyses, and multiparameter immune monitoring. Core 2 will provide unified data processing, analytical
pipelines, data integration, data repository, and statistical consultation. Because male prevalence in cancer
incidence and mortality is observed across many other cancer types, our scientific findings will likely have broad
implications in cancer medicine far beyond BC."
10817696,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Overview: Obesity and gastrointestinal diseases are among the most common indications for surgery (e.g.,
bariatric surgery, gastroesophageal reflux, hernias, diverticulitis, etc…). However, there are considerably fewer
scientists studying these topics compared to other clinical areas (e.g., surgical oncology, vascular surgery,
transplantation), particularly among surgeon-scientists. This T32 grant, “Obesity & Gastrointestinal Surgery
Scientist Training Program” will integrate all aspects of obesity and gastrointestinal surgery research at the
University of Michigan – from “bench to beside, and practice to policy”— allowing us to address fundamental
questions in a multidisciplinary way1–7. This program will improve surgical research by integrating these various
scientific disciplines to produce significant cross-fertilization among scientists, clinicians, and health service
investigators on this critical topic. Enhanced training will increase the number of surgical investigators using
sophisticated approaches to these large-scale problems associated with surgical approaches to treat obesity and
gastrointestinal diseases. The University of Michigan is in a unique position to conduct post-doctoral T32
training program in obesity & gastrointestinal surgery that includes both basic mechanistic science and
clinical outcomes research. In additional to our existing strengths in obesity, metabolism, and outcomes
research, much of this work led by Randy Seeley, PhD, we believe the University of Michigan has an
unprecedented critical mass of scientists focusing on the intersection of obesity with gastrointestinal surgery.
Moreover, the University of Michigan is a national center of excellence in surgical outcomes and health services
research with a robust profile of work funded by NIH, AHRQ and PCORI. Justin B. Dimick, MD, MPH, the chair of
the Department of Surgery, leads this area of excellence, which includes the Center for Healthcare Outcomes &
Policy, the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative (MBSC), and the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative
(MSQC), statewide clinical data registry and quality improvement programs focused on obesity and gastrointestinal
surgery, respectively. There are numerous scientific training programs that focus on research on obesity and
gastrointestinal diseases. However, there are no programs specifically dedicated to preparing scientists and
surgeon-scientists for a career dedicated to studying surgery for obesity and gastrointestinal surgery, and
the intersection of these two important disease areas. Although this proposal will train both surgeon- scientists
and non-surgeon scientists (i.e., PhDs and non-surgery clinician scientists), there is an acute need for more
surgeon scientists in these fields. It is important to have scientifically trained surgeons who can ask important
questions and conduct meaningful research. Specifically, more obesity & gastrointestinal surgery scientists are
needed for the following: Provide more intellectual horsepower and research creativity; Provide the specialty-
specific clinical expertise to steer research; To establish thought leaders who can ultimately effect change within
surgery."

10830259,"Project Summary/Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are commonly administered in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with
the goal of increasing oxygen delivery; however, storage of RBCs may limit efficacy to prevent or reverse
oxygen debt. RBC transfusions have been independently associated with increased PICU morbidity and
mortality and impart additional risk to patients due to infectious and non-infectious serious hazards of
transfusion. Evidence-based guidelines were developed to restrict transfusion to those patients most likely to
benefit. Liberal transfusion practices persist; however, placing nearly one quarter million children annually
admitted to the PICU at risk for harm from transfusions. Threshold-based guidelines exist for hemodynamically
stable patients with a hemoglobin (Hb) >7 g/dL where evidence is robust, whereas clinical judgement is
recommended when Hb is 5-7 g/dL or in hemodynamically unstable patients with a Hb > 7 g/dL.
Qualitative study of barriers and facilitators to implementation of the transfusion guidelines and intervention
mapping informed the development of a bundle of implementation strategies directed at addressing specific
contextual barriers to routine adoption of the transfusion guidelines in the PICU. The bundle of strategies,
informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) includes building consensus,
identifying, and empowering champions, educating providers, use of integrated computerized clinical decision
support (CCDS) tools, and providing quantitative metric-based feedback to providers.
The proposed pilot study aims to address two critical gaps in operationalization and evaluation of the
implementation bundle across institutions that are necessary prior to execution of a multi-center type 2 hybrid
effectiveness and implementation trial to formally evaluate the implementation bundle. These include the need
for 1) validated, electronic cohort characterization of patients at-risk for unnecessary RBC transfusion and 2)
optimization and integration of CCDS tools, which are anticipated to pose the greatest operational challenges
in a multi-site study. Thus, we propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Create and validate a computable phenotype for a dynamic cohort of PICU patients at-risk for
unnecessary transfusion, including children eligible for threshold-based and/or clinical judgment-based CCDS
tools
Specific Aim 2. Deploy and assess implementation of Computerized Clinical Decision Support (CCDS) tools
as one component of the transfusion implementation bundle. Evaluation of the CCDS tools using a customized
version of the RE-AIM evaluative implementation framework for clinical informatics will facilitate further
optimization of the tools."
10867277,"Project Summary
Lifelong lens transparency and flexible shape, required for focusing light onto the retina, relies upon epithelial
and fiber cells whose shapes and organizations depend on filamentous (F-) actin networks. Epithelial cells
contain three distinct F-actin networks: lateral cell junctions, basal stress fibers, and unique apical polygonal
arrays. These networks consist of tropomyosin (Tpm) isoforms that stabilize F-actin, as well as non-muscle
myosin IIA (NMIIA), and are thought to generate contractile or tensile forces to stabilize epithelial deformation
and integrity during whole lens shape changes, but this has not been tested. Epithelial cells differentiate into
long, thin fiber cells that form complex membrane interlocking protrusions and paddle-like domains that change
with maturation and depth. Fiber cell membrane protrusions are supported by F-actin networks stabilized by
fiber cell Tpm3.5, which regulates F-actin cross-linkers. In Tpm3.5-depleted lenses, the flexible crosslinker, a-
actinin1, is increased on membranes, whereas the stiff crosslinker fimbrin (plastin) is decreased. Tpm3.5-
depleted lenses have decreased whole lens stiffness and resiliency suggesting that more flexible F-actin
networks allow greater fiber cell membrane deformation to result in softer lenses. However, the mechanistic
links between F-actin networks, membrane deformation, cellular architecture, and whole lens shape change
are unclear. The objective of this proposal is to determine how the F-actin networks in epithelial and fiber cells
control membrane deformations and cellular shapes to confer whole lens transparency and flexibility. To
address this, we will use mouse lenses to test gene function and primate lenses as a model for human lens
shape change. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that distinct F-actin and NMIIA networks control epithelial
deformation and stability during whole lens shape changes. Tpm isoforms associated with epithelial F-actin
networks will be determined, and fluorescent-tagged Tpms, F-actin, NMIIA and cell membranes visualized by
live cell confocal microscopy to investigate network dynamics and cell deformation during whole lens shape
changes. F-actin network functions will be targeted by pharmacological (mouse and primate) or genetic
(mouse) approaches. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Tpm3.5-regulated F-actin networks in fiber cells confer
membrane deformation and lens flexibility in a depth-dependent fashion during whole lens shape change.
Fiber cell shape deformations under mechanical strain will be visualized by multiphoton imaging of fluorescent-
labeled membranes in live lenses (mouse), membrane structures examined by scanning electron microscopy
of lenses fixed under deformation (mouse and primate), and whole lens stiffness measured as a function of
lens age. This work will elucidate the fundamental basis by which F-actin networks establish lens epithelial
stability and fiber cell deformability to sustain lifelong lens transparency and flexibility. Identification of
molecular targets in F-actin networks that control lens flexibility will provide candidates to devise future
strategies to mitigate age-related cataracts and presbyopia, which is linked to age-dependent lens stiffening."
10839356,"Small resistance arterioles are the principal regulators of tissue blood flow and blood
pressure. These vessels sense changes in circumferential tension and continuously
adjust their caliber to help maintain tissue perfusion, a process termed “myogenic
autoregulation”. Although, myogenic tone usually changes slowly in arterioles of the
heart and skeletal muscle, the myogenic tone is very rapid. This speed allows these
organs to regulate high flow rates (up to 85% of cardiac output) to maintain
spatiotemporal perfusion. Further, in skeletal muscle, the arterial tone is quickly turned
off (<1s) after an initial muscle contraction to allow increased blood flow (reactive
hyperemia), and aid the transition from rest to exercise. Importantly, during heart
disease, diabetes, sepsis and ageing, myogenic tone markedly declines, impairing
hemodynamics, muscle performance and contributing to pathology. The underlying
mechanisms that enable dynamic regulation of myogenic tone are unknown. In this
proposal, we will explore a critical role for the heat-gated ion channel, TRPV1. Our
preliminary data, using TRPV1 reporter mice and functional studies combined, show that
TRPV1 channels specifically localize to the smooth muscle of arterioles in the heart,
skeletal muscle and adipose. We hypothesize that TRPV1 serves as a transduction
channel to confer dynamic myogenic tone in small arterioles. Specifically, we will test the
proposal that TRPV1 integrates two distinct properties of blood flow, both mechanical
stimuli downstream of mechanosensing GPCRs, and the local blood temperature. We
propose 3 aims to test this innovative hypothesis and to understand the underlying
mechanisms. (1) To test the hypothesis that TRPV1 is critical for dynamic myogenic tone
in small arteries and mechanotransduction in arterial smooth muscle cells, (2) To test the
hypothesis that PLC signaling and heat underlie TRPV1 myogenic tone, (3) To test the
hypothesis that binding of PI(4,5)P2 enables persistent TRPV1 activation necessary for
myogenic tone."

A group of principal investigators at the University of Minnesota seeks to renew our Training Program under the
new title “Functional Multi-omics of Aging” to support predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. The goal of the
Training Program is to assist exceptional young scientists develop the intellectual and technical skills needed for
productive careers as biomedical researchers and educators in aging biology with a focus on training in -omics
technologies. The Training Program is in its 14th year of funding and has trained 23 pre- and 15 post-doctoral

Training Program will interface with the newly established and continually expanding Institute on the Biology of
Aging and Metabolism (iBAM) at the University of Minnesota to further provide trainees experiential training in
the biology of aging and multi-omics through workshops, conferences, seminars, symposia, journal clubs, and a
visitorship program. Through iBAM, our institution has recruited internationally prominent researchers in aging
biology and with this explosion of energy and ideas, our training faculty has grown from 19 to 23, diversifying
rank, background, and departmental homes. Training faculty research focuses on the use of -omics technologies
to reveal the molecular details behind aging and they draw trainees from five graduate programs: Biochemistry,
Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Chemistry, Integrative Biology & Physiology, Neuroscience, and
Rehabilitation Science. New leadership of this T32 takes on an MPI structure to capture the breadth of needs
with Drs. Arriaga, Lowe, and Niedernhofer synergizing their expertise in graduate education, -omics technology,
aging research, and professional development. Our aging research is supported by outstanding genomics,
proteomics, and imaging cores at UMN equipped with state-of-the-art single cell and spatial transcriptomics and

 Our research goal is to develop new catalytic technologies for the rapid synthesis and late-stage
functionalization under mild reaction conditions of complex, biorelevant molecules. Our research efforts have
been directed to exploit visible-light-induced excited-state catalysis, a process that involves at least one
photoexcited catalytic species, to address unmet challenges in organic synthesis. Excited-state catalysis involves
the photoexcitation of catalytic organic or organometallic compounds that allows access to their excited-state
landscapes for the development of previously elusive synthetic transformations. This proposal aims to continue
our efforts in establishing novel excited-state catalytic platforms for the synthesis of valuable fluorinated
compounds, the derivatization of carbonyl moieties, and the site-selective functionalization of carbohydrates.
More specifically, we will develop (i) polyfluoroalkoxylation reactions of various hydrocarbons via excited-state
catalysis; (ii) new redox-active reagents such as those that can be used for pentafluorosulfenylation and
fluorosulfonylation; (iii) regioselective polyfluoroalkoxylation reactions of arenes and heteroarenes through
metallaphotocatalysis; (iv) new excited-state catalysts to modulate the reactivity of carbonyl compounds; and (v)
site-selective functionalization of carbohydrates. Since fluorinated compounds, carbonyl derivatives, and
functionalized sugars are ubiquitous in natural products, therapeutics, imaging agents, fine chemicals, and
biomaterials, successful development of the proposed research will allow convenient access to and the studies of
numerous new functional molecules to aid the discovery and development of new drugs, agrochemicals, bio-

10910991,"PROGRAM SUMMARY 
Radiological imaging is often the first step of the diagnostic pathway for many devastating diseases; thus, an erroneous assessment of “normal” can lead to death. Whereas a grayscale object in an image can be described by its first-order image statistics—such as contrast, spatial frequency, position, entropy, and orientation—none of these dimensions, by itself, indicates abnormal vs normal radiological findings. We are a highly diverse team proposing an empirical approach to determine the mixtures of the first-order statistics—the “visual textures”— that radiology experts explicitly and implicitly use to identify the locations of potential abnormalities in medical images. Our innovative approach does not rely on assumptions about which textures may or may not be im-portant to abnormality detection. Instead, we will track the oculomotor behavior of expert radiologists to deter-mine their conscious and unconscious targeting choices, and thus ascertain which textures are empirically in-formative. The ability of expert radiologists to rapidly find abnormalities suggests that they may be able to first identify them in their retinal periphery. Peripheral visual analysis skills are therefore potentially critical to radio-logic performance, despite being understudied. We will measure these skills and leverage the results to develop perceptual learning heuristics to improve peripheral abnormality texture detection. By comparing novices to ex-perts we will determine whether the first are inexpert due to a lack of sensitivity to diagnostically relevant textures (texture informativeness), or to a lack of knowledge about which textures are abnormal, or to a combined lack of both sensitivity and knowledge. Radiology also requires the acquisition of oculomotor skills through practice and optimization. Radiologic expertise thus changes the oculomotor system in predictable and detectable ways, in much the same way that an athlete’s body and brain change as a function of expertise acquisition in their sport. We will therefore analyze both the consistency between experts’ fixation choices in medical images, and the eye movement performance characteristics of experts vs novice radiologists, to create an objective oculomotor bi-omarker of radiological expertise. The differences between novices and experts will train a deep learning (DL) system, which will have human visual and oculomotor performance characteristics. Training the DL with the abnormalities identified by a panel of expert radiologists will allow it to pinpoint the possible solutions in the manner of a simulated human radiologist performing at peak accuracy, precision, and speed. The resulting rank-ordered list of possible optimal and suboptimal image-reading strategies will serve as a benchmarking tool to quantify the performance of actual clinicians and residents who read the same images, rested vs fatigued. Meas-uring the effects of both training and fatigue on radiology expertise will be a major interdisciplinary cross-cutting advance in performance assessment. Our proposal to quantify fatigue in terms of erosion of expertise represents a transformational advance towards objective fitness-for-duty and expertise measures in medicine and beyond."

 The primary objective of this research project is to create a new approach to identifying the state-of-health
of implanted ventricular assist devices (VAD) using nothing more than a smart electronic stethoscope and a
single lead ECG. VADs are pumps permanently implanted into patients with poor left ventricular function. They
run at a set speed with almost no internal automatic speed adjustments. For this reason, it is a complex problem
for healthcare providers to diagnose VAD patients who present with symptoms that may or may not be due to
reduced pump performance. The current state-of-the-art requires very highly trained healthcare providers with
access to expensive clinical equipment and sometimes requires invasive or partially invasive procedures just to
determine if the symptoms might be due to the VAD device, let alone what the specific problem is.
 We hypothesize that through the use of advanced signal processing and machine learning
techniques, we can classify a VAD patient’s health status as it pertains to the VAD’s mechanical
performance and hemodynamic flow into normal and dysfunctional states.
 To test this hypothesis, we will modify an existing hemodynamic simulator that creates not only time-varying
pressure to the VAD input and output, but also has heart valves that create an acoustic signature similar to human
valves, and can be underfilled to the point of ventricular collapse (all conditions similar to those commonly seen
in a VAD-rich clinical environment). We will specifically address most VAD failure modes: (1) underfilling of the
VAD inflow relative to the pump speed, (2) excessive afterload due to either systemic hypertension or the
presence of occlusions within the VAD flow circuit, (3) presence of significant valvular disease (aortic
regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and mitral stenosis), and (4) the effect of heart rate and rhythm on VAD
performance. Various severity levels of these conditions will be seeded in the simulator, and the audio signature
of the VAD pump and associated native heart sounds will be recorded. The digital heart sound measurements
will be processed using novel algorithms to be developed in this protocol to understand the root physical cause,
and compared to the VAD function/dysfunction mode being tested. As the project proceeds actual patient data,
collected by the research team in 2018 in a non-invasive manner (stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound), will be
compared versus the simulator results under the same conditions.
 If the proposed research is successful there is the opportunity to: (1) improve patient care by detecting
common clinical conditions at an early stage, (2) avoid the need for advanced diagnostics in some cases, (3)
allow medical personnel to test various VAD settings to optimize output without the need for advanced
diagnostics, and (4) allow for remote diagnostics of VAD problems. In addition to Dr. Jason Kolodziej, Dr. Steven
Day, Dr. Linwei Wang, Dr. Karl Schwarz, Dr. Igor Gosev, and Dr. Michael Richards, the research team will consist
of three senior design teams (15 UG students), three to six undergraduate students, and a Ph.D. student."
10931333,"We propose conversion of the P41 Resource for Native Mass Spectrometry Guided Structural Biology (2018- )
to an RM1 Biomedical Technology Development and Dissemination (BTDD) Center. The nMSSB Center will
produce robust, universally-available, transformative technology for characterizing the assembly and
disassembly of macromolecular protein complexes, including the definition of their compositions, PTMs,
stoichiometry, structure/architecture/topology, flexibility/stability, and their conformational/binding-induced
changes under different conditions. The inclusion of an integrated workflow for native mass spectrometry (nMS)
will enable, complement, and expand what is possible with other structural biology (SB) tools. We propose three
highly synergistic Technology Development Projects (TDPs) that build from our productive P41 Technology
Research and Development. Feasibility for the TDPs has been established through preliminary data and
publications in high-quality journals, as well as through the licensing of one version of our SID technology by an
MS vendor (Waters Corp.), release of a desalting column (based on our online buffer exchange progress) by
another vendor (Thermo) in 2022, and the funding of two SBIR grants (eMSion and Protein Metrics). We continue
and expand our relationships with multiple MS vendors/ sustainability partners, biopharma
collaborators/industrial advisory board members, and add two technology partners (Ivanov and Coon). Ten
geographically and topically/scientifically diverse Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) have been selected to drive
technology development and extend nMS to leading biomedical laboratories that are tackling e.g., cancer, viral
infections, and neurological disorders. Our three TDPs focus on different vendor-neutral tools coupled in multiple
ways to maximize future nMS options. TDP1 optimizes a panel of solution-phase separation and measurement
tools, including the expansion of two-column online buffer exchange, capillary electrophoresis, and variable
temperature electrospray ionization. TDP2 develops improved mass selection using digital quadrupole
technology and improved resolution Fourier transform ion mobility (IM) spectrometry, couples surface induced
dissociation with multiple IM and MS analyzers including charge detection mass spectrometry, and develops
computational methods to use energy-resolved nMS data and IM to identify “near-native” computational models.
TDP3 develops collision- and surface-induced unfolding to screen biomolecular stability, adapts TDP
technologies for vendor-specific complex down/native-omics approaches, and constructs integrated
computations that utilize synergistic MS restraints to predict protein quaternary structures. Our administration &
management structure provides leadership, coordinates communication/collaboration, and drives sustainability.
Our community engagement plan continues dissemination and training to include publications, technology
transfer to beta testers and vendors, an annual nMS short course, virtual and hands-on workshops, and multiple
“sustainability sites” where nMS workflows will be integrated with other SB tools for non-expert and expert users."
10888987,"Project Summary/Abstract
Synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths have increased sharply. Fentanyl is driving many of those overdose
deaths. However, oxycodone is one of the most prescribed opioid medications in the US. Current in vitro assays
and in vivo models designed to study the pathophysiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) and to discover potential
therapeutic targets are useful, but there is a need for additional model systems. Our preliminary data and serval
preclinical study using single-cell sequencing have revealed that each opioid agent might have unique molecular
profiles and mechanisms of action. Those findings highlight the need for additional models to evaluate drug
action in the brain at the single-cell level. Our research team combines expertise in addiction medicine,
pharmacogenomics, and bioinformatics, expertise required to develop a computational and experimental
framework to integrate gene expression and chromatin accessibility in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived brain organoids. The goal of the proposed study is to provide novel mechanistic insight into drug action
at single-cell resolution. Our research strategy involves the use of single-cell sequencing technology and
iPSC-derived 3D brain organoids to identify molecular signatures for OUD using two commonly prescribed
synthetic opioids: oxycodone and fentanyl as molecular probes. Aim 1, we will define molecular characteristics
of response to synthetic opioids: oxycodone and fentanyl exposure of iPSC-derived forebrain organoids from
both OUD patients and healthy controls at the single-cell level. Aim 2, we propose to reconstruct transcriptional
regulons in different cell types in the brain organoids by applying novel network biology approaches to prioritize
potential candidates, to detect meaningful biological information embedded in the sea of Big Data and to uncover
novel regulatory mechanisms that explain the properties of biological phenotypes. These approaches could help
to develop mechanistic hypothesis for experimental validation. Aim 3, we will study genes and pathways
identified from Aim 1 and Aim 2 with regard to their potential use as novel drug targets for OUD treatment or
prevention, by pursuing functional genomic studies using appropriate iPS-derived CNS cell types and brain
organoids Our findings will enhance the general understanding of drug mechanism(s) of action and the
underlying pathophysiology responsible for opioid addiction in a drug-dependent fashion, thus opening new
avenues to discover novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of OUD. In summary, this proposal is based on
extensive preliminary data, and decades of experience in using drugs as “molecular probes” for underlying
genomic and other omic mechanisms. As a result, the proposed studies have significant implications for
molecular mechanisms leading to understanding of the pathophysiology of OUD as well as the discovery of novel
therapeutic agents for OUD treatment and/or prevention. If successful, our research approaches could be
generalizable to other opioids and to other substance use disorders."
10629938,"Prion diseases or Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies are transmissible neurodegenerative diseases
in humans and animals that have no treatment and are 100% lethal. The transformation of glia into reactive
states is recognized as one of the major hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases including prion, Alzheimer’s,
and Parkinson’s diseases. Conflicting data exist on whether in prion diseases, reactive microglia are protective
or deleterious. Microglia are regarded as the main cells in CNS responsible for phagocytosis, yet the role of
microglia-driven phagocytosis in prion disease has never been systematically examined. The current project is
designed to fill this knowledge gap. Our recent studies supported by a previous award revealed that microglia
not only effectively phagocytose prions or PrPSc but also engulf viable neurons that do not display apoptotic
markers. Our work suggests that PrPSc primes microglia for phagocytosis via activating phagocytic pathways
that sense exposed galactose as an ‘eat-me’ signal. We hypothesize that the phenotype of microglia transforms
with disease progression, changing from primarily protective at the early stages when microglia uptake PrPSc, to
predominantly detrimental at the later stages when microglia also target viable neurons. Aim 1 will establish the
timeline of PrPSc uptake and neuronal engulfment in prion-infected animals, and rigorously test whether reactive
microglia associated with prion disease phagocytose viable neurons. Aim 2 will assess the role of the P2y12
receptor in microglial phagocytosis of neurons. This aim will use P2ry12 inhibitors approved by the FDA and a
mouse model for the conditional knockout of P2ry12 in myeloid cells to test whether the depletion of P2ry12
slows down or reverses disease progression in prion-infected animals. Aim 3 will employ primary microglia
isolated from prion-infected animals to test whether the engulfment of viable neurons is mediated by phagocytic
pathways that sense exposed galactose. Furthermore, Aim 3 will examine the effect of a conditional knockout of
CD11b, which constitutes the MAC-1 phagocytic receptor in myeloid cells, on disease progression in prion-
infected animals. As a whole, this study will inform us as to whether phagocytic activity should be targeted as a
potential therapeutic strategy for treating prion diseases. Among the goals of this application is a translational
component that will test the effectiveness of FDA-approved inhibitors of P2y12 receptors applied after clinical
onset."
10842424,"While generally the genes in a single organism are thought of as having aligned
interests – maximizing the fitness of the organism – under some circumstances,
different genes in an individual may benefit from different tradeoffs between an
organism’s characteristics. Under such “intragenomic conflict,” different genes may
evolve to influence the organism in different ways, and to antagonize the actions of
other genes. While the importance of this fact is well-understood among molecular
evolutionary biologists, biomedical researchers have largely failed to appreciate these
implications. In the proposed work, we will explore the long-underappreciated role of
the X chromosome in intragenomic conflict, and elucidate the impacts of this conflict on
human biology. The X chromosome is expected to experience particularly high levels of
intragenomic conflict both because of its atypical inheritance pattern (being primarily
inherited from females) and because of its hemizygous experience (allowing a single
allele to have outsize influence). The long term goals of this research programme are to
understand how intragenomic conflict influences human health and to devise conflict-
focused strategies for interventions. The short-term goals of this proposal are to identify
the regulatory, transcriptomic and cellular impacts of conflict-drive X chromosomal
biology. We will pursue these goals through (i) studying the impact of genomic conflict
on X chromosomal microRNA regulatory networks; (ii) identifying genes that are
differentially expressed on X chromosomes depending on which parent they are
inherited from; and (iii) using single-cell RNA-seq data to identify the cell-type and
transcriptomic impacts of differential expression of maternally- and paternally-inherited
X chromosomes in human tissues."
10901841,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Circadian rhythms are highly conserved, 24-hour, oscillations that tune human physiology to the
day/night cycle, enhancing fitness by ensuring that appropriate activities occur at biologically advantageous
times. Disruption of proper circadian timing negatively impacts the human long-term medical outlook, making
understanding the mechanism underlying circadian regulation over cellular physiology critical to human health.
Circadian rhythms are controlled via a transcription-translation based negative feedback loop, or clock. The
current paradigm for circadian regulation over physiology, termed the clocks “output”, is that transcriptional
programing generated by the clock drives temporally-specific waves of gene expression. However, our research
has revealed that transcriptional programing cannot wholly account for clock output, as we discovered weak
correlation between mRNAs and proteins that oscillate with a circadian periodicity, particularly in the circadian
regulation of immunometabolism. The mechanisms that control this post-transcriptional regulation are
unknown, but we have shown that intrinsic protein disorder in the repressive complex of the clock may control
the formation of macromolecular complexes to time clock output post-transcriptionally.
 Our immediate research goal is to identify specific pathways by which the clock imparts post-
transcriptional control over the immune response at the biophysical, molecular, and physiological levels. We
hypothesize that circadian post-transcriptional metabolic regulation can tune immune-tissue and sex-specific
rhythms via the formation of time-of-day defined macromolecular protein complexes that are centered around
the repressive complex of the circadian clock. To test this hypothesis, we will create a Conformational/Temporal
Interactome (CiTI) map of circadian repressive complex proteins. We will also investigate the contribution of
sex-specific metabolic post-transcriptional regulation to immune cell functions to demonstrate the effects of
metabolic oscillations on the basal immune response. As a mechanism for keeping time, circadian feedback loops
are highly conserved and much of what is understood about the molecular clock comes from the investigation
of clock model systems. We will therefore exploit the simplicity and reproducibility of fungal and mammalian
model systems to cost-effectively address our hypotheses. Due to the conservation of clock architecture, our
findings will have the potential to define several novel and unrecognized paradigms in clock regulation over
cellular physiology, including the sources and effects of circadian post-transcriptional regulation. These newly
defined paradigms will further our long-term goal of elucidating the fundamental principles of circadian timing
by identifying the mechanistic underpinnings of circadian control over cellular physiology."
10841489,"Summary:
Ischemic brain damage due to cardiac arrest or stroke is one of the most complex pathophysiologic
processes. To successfully treat ischemic brain injury, one need to target several cellular pathways and
cell-type within the brain.
 NAD+ is an essential cofactor involved in multiple bioenergetic reactions and its degradation
after ischemia leads to pathologic cellular metabolism and inhibition of energy production. The majority
of cellular NAD+ is re-synthetized via the salvage pathway, where nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)
is converted to NAD+. Our recent studies demonstrated that administration of NMN dramatically
ameliorates ischemic brain injury following transient global cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, NMN
treatment inhibited post-ischemic NAD+ catabolism, reduced poly-ADP-ribose generation, and reversed
the excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. Finally, the ischemia-induced changes in mitochondrial
protein acetylation were inhibited in NMN injected animals. Overall goal of this proposed project is to
develop the most effective treatment strategy utilizing NMN that will dramatically reduce ischemic brain
damage and characterize the mechanism of its neuroprotection. We hypothesize that NMN
administration after ischemia will significantly inhibit neurodegeneration due to its multi-targeted effect
and ability to improve mitochondrial functions and cellular bioenergetics.
 Specific Aim 1 is focused on the NMN-induced protein acetylation mechanisms that modulate
mitochondrial dynamics and function. The role of Sirt1 and Sirt3 dependent deacetylation in
mitochondrial fusion and fission will be determined using our transgenic animal models that
concomitantly express mitochondria targeted eYFP and Sirt1 or Sirt3. Additionally, SIRT1, and SIRT3
knockout animals will be used as tools for inhibition of deacetylase activity. In specific Aim 2, we will
perform time-dependent studies of NMN administration following global cerebral ischemia in mice. We
will use unbiased stereological quantification of neuronal cell death, and multiple cognitive tests will be
performed to assess the efficacy of treatment. The recovery periods will vary from 7 days up to 6
months after ischemic insult. In specific Aim 3, we will determine the neuroprotective effect of the NMN
treatment by using the most neuroprotective protocol determined in Aim 2 on female and aged animals.
 The significance of this work is that it proposes to identify NMN as a protective compound that
will significantly impact the clinical application of NAD+ precursors as therapeutic compounds for acute
brain injury and potentially reveal new targets for neuroprotection."

10868426,"SUMMARY
My research program focuses on quantitatively characterizing the role of RNA structure in post-transcriptional
regulatory processes. Comparisons of protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance at genome scale reveal
low correlation between the two gene expression levels in most human tissues and other organisms. This poor
correlation suggests that a significant amount of gene regulation occurs post-transcriptionally. To discover
elements in mRNAs that control their activities, we measure the effects of human disease-associated structure
variants that map to non-coding regions of the transcriptome. Specifically, we integrate computational structure
prediction with high-throughput allele-specific chemical structure probing in vivo to assess the functional
consequences of RNA structure change. We also establish the causality of these variants by using quantitative
reporter assays to measure translation efficiency, splicing, and mRNA stability. In total, these experiments
provide molecular explanations of disease mechanisms. To support these goals, we develop, implement, and
apply both computational and experimental approaches to study RNA structure in the cell. Our proposed
research program will further develop two important technological innovations. The first is a hybrid
experimental/computational approach for studying precursor and mature mRNA structure simultaneously in vivo;
this approach integrates mutational profiling of SHAPE-MaP data (Selective 2’-Hydroxyl Acylation by Primer
Extension – Mutational Profiling) with Boltzmann suboptimal sampling of the secondary structural ensemble. The
second innovation is SHAPE-JuMP, which uses a bifunctional RNA modification reagent and a highly processive
reverse transcriptase that “jumps” across chemical crosslinks to probe through-space three-dimensional contacts
in RNA. We will use these technologies to establish the structures of both precursor and mature mRNAs. In
addition, we will extend the biological scope of our work by using these technologies to collaboratively investigate
inter- and intramolecular interactions in positive strand RNA viruses. In sum, this program will identify novel RNA
structure motifs that regulate the functions of precursor and mature mRNAs and viral genomes."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve outcomes of delivery of small molecules,

carbon sources. Second, we will create genome-scale libraries in our candidate biotherapeutics,
E. coli Nissle 1917 and Lactococcus lactis, to identify gene products that increase fitness in the
gut and gut-like environments. The methods will be tested in in vitro culture, small intestinal
organoid co-culture, and in vivo in the mouse gut to determine enrichment of the biotherapeutic
population, enhanced production of the therapeutic small molecule, peptide, or protein of

 Chiral amines are prevalent motifs in nature and medicine. Conversely, alcohols are among the cheapest
and most ubiquitous molecules. This program is dedicated to the development of new, remote C-H
functionalization strategies that will streamline the synthesis of biologically relevant amines from abundant
alcohol precursors. The key innovation of the proposed approach is the design of catalysts to harness
regioselective 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms via imidate (β) and amidyl (δ) radicals. Through
catalyst-controlled generation of nitrogen-centered radicals, as well as newly enabled regulation of their remote
(β or δ) terminations, we seek to access new types of reactivity and selectivity. For example, the first
asymmetric examples of several radical-mediated transformations are proposed. Additionally, a series of novel,
single and double C-H functionalization cascades are described. The elucidation of these divergent
mechanisms for intercepting radical intermediates will enable new access to valuable, remote transformations,
including the synthesis of several medicinally relevant scaffolds (e.g. α-amino acids, β-amino alcohols, aza-
heterocycles) in a rapid, modular, and selective fashion.
 The significance of these strategies for radical-mediated, remote C-H functionalization is their facilitation of
the discovery of otherwise unlikely synthetic reactivity. Specifically, by employing transient imidate radical
chaperones, alcohols may be selectively converted to a family of chiral amines. Two metal-catalyzed classes
of reactivity (stereoselective HAT and termination, or desymmetrization by HAT) are proposed to facilitate
asymmetric β C-H amination and other enantioselective functionalizations. In parallel, new approaches for
metal-mediated, amidyl radical generation from amines will facilitate their more rapid and direct access, as well
as new avenues for their remote cross-coupling with arenes and other nucleophiles. The newly elucidated
mechanisms for harnessing novel δ C-H reactivity (by amidyl radicals) will also enable further developments of
chaperone-mediated β C-H functionalizations (by imidate radicals). Together, these studies will further expand
our ability to selectively control remote HAT mechanisms and enable novel, useful, and unprecedented C-H
editing of alcohols and amines found in medicinally relevant molecules."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disorder that leads to end-
stage kidney disease. To date, tolvaptan is the only approved intervention to slow kidney disease progression
in patients with ADPKD. However, tolvaptan is constrained by high cost and common side effects that limit
adherence and is only indicated for rapidly progressing ADPKD. Thus, alternative or concurrent interventions
that may slow progression of ADPKD are of considerable clinical importance. Similar to the general
population, body-mass index has been increasing in patients with ADPKD, and approximately nearly 70% of
adults with ADPKD are overweight or obese. Adipocytes do not simply act as a fat reservoir, but are active
endocrine organs, and thus, may be a promising clinical target for ADPKD management. Mounting evidence
also suggests that a metabolic defect exists in ADPKD, which likely contributes to cystic epithelial proliferation
and subsequent cyst growth. Mild-to-moderate food restriction profoundly slows cyst growth and maintains
renal function in numerous rodent models of PKD via mechanisms including activation of AMP-activated kinase
and suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin-S6 kinase signaling and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels.
Additionally, we have shown that overweight and obesity are strong independent predictors of more rapid
kidney growth, measured by total kidney volume (TKV). We recently completed a R03-funded pilot study
supporting that a behavioral weight loss intervention via daily caloric restriction (DCR) in adults with ADPKD
and overweight or obesity: 1) is feasible and acceptable; 2) slowed kidney growth (annual %∆ in height-
adjusted TKV [htTKV]); 3) reduced abdominal adiposity; and 4) altered markers of biological pathways
implicated in ADPKD progression and metabolism. However, our pilot and feasibility study was limited by a
small sample size, relatively short duration, and lack of a control group. Thus, to translate these promising
results of our pilot study towards clinical practice, we propose a parallel-group, randomized, controlled clinical
trial in 126 adults with ADPKD and overweight or obesity to directly compare the efficacy of behavioral weight
loss intervention based on DCR vs. control (standard clinical advice for ADPKD) for slowing kidney growth over
a longer duration. Changes in abdominal adiposity will serve as a secondary outcome. Effects of weight loss
on circulating and adipose markers of biological pathways will provide mechanistic insight.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of a DCR-based behavioral weight loss intervention on kidney growth
(annual %∆ htTKV by MRI over 24 months) vs. control (standard clinical dietary advice for ADPKD).
Specific Aim 2: Quantify changes in abdominal adiposity (visceral, subcutaneous, and total) by MRI in each
group and their association with changes in htTKV and markers of biological pathways.
Specific Aim 3: Measure changes in makers of biological pathways in blood and adipose tissue.
Specific Aim 4: Further evaluate the safety of DCR in ADPKD vs. control, to optimize clinical translation."

Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders impacting our youth.
Unfortunately, the effects of CD are not limited to these early years. Youth with CD are more likely to develop
lifelong mental and physical health problems, which is why CD is responsible for 5.75 million years of healthy
life lost. There is mixed evidence supporting the effectiveness of treatment for CD, and this may be because
youth with CD have differing etiological mechanisms. Research has shown that there is heterogeneity among
youth with CD, with a subgroup of CD youth displaying more severe behavioral and personality symptoms, called
callous-unemotional (CU) traits. CU traits is a specifier for CD that designates a high-risk group of youth who
engage in chronic violence and criminal behavior, placing a significant burden on families and society. The key
distinction is that these youth show distinct personality symptoms that current CD interventions are not equipped
to treat, such as callousness towards others, lack of empathy and guilt for their harmful behaviors, and
shallow/diminished affect. Understanding the mechanisms behind CU traits is essential for equipping
interventions with the knowledge needed to employ a targeted approach for treating CU traits. Longstanding
theories suggest that fearlessness is a key mechanism in the development of CU traits. However, biological
evidence supporting the association between CU traits and fearlessness is deficient, and the current state of this
examination has been restricted because of ecological validity. We will examine the association between fear
and CU traits in youth (13-17 years) with CD by measuring sympathetic (pre-ejection period) and
parasympathetic nervous system reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) during immersion in cutting edge virtual
reality (VR) fear induction. We will concurrently apply facial electromyography to assess levels of positive and
negative valence. We will also determine sex differences in these associations, as well as provide evidence of
how biological fear profiles contribute to the stability of CU traits over 12 months during the adolescent period.
The potential benefits of the proposal are high. Based on our pilot data, we will test our hypothesis that youth
with CU traits will display a unique biological profile to fear that cannot be explained by fearlessness, and these
associations are sex-specific. Confirming this finding in youth with CD may lead to reshaping prior developmental
theories of CU traits that could lead to improved screening and more favorable gender-responsive treatment
strategies for our youth."

Contraceptive patterns are changing and the implications for ovarian cancer risk are unknown. Oral
contraceptives (OCs), which are an established protective factor for ovarian cancer, are being used less
frequently and intrauterine device use (IUD) is on the rise. However, the impact of changing contraceptive
patterns on ovarian cancer incidence is unclear. While most studies of IUDs and ovarian cancer risk suggest
an inverse association, some studies report no association or even a slight increase in risk. Differences
between these studies could be attributable to IUD type, timing, or molecular features of tumors including
histotypes. Preliminary data from the New England Case Control (NEC) Study suggest the association
between IUDs and ovarian cancer risk vary by histotype, with a non-significant decrease in risk of low-grade
serous and clear cell tumors but not for other histotypes. Furthermore, we observed an increased risk of
ovarian cancer with low tumor stromal CD163 expression, reflecting heme scavenger receptor expression
decreased M2-type macrophage infiltration. These observations suggest the impact of IUD use on ovarian
cancer risk may differ by subtype and subgroup, but larger samples sizes are needed. Inflammation is known
to play a role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis, and IUDs exert their physiologic effect through local
inflammation. However, IUD-associated inflammation may be accompanied by an immune response that
could lead to clearance of premalignant cells or local infection. An appreciation of how ovarian cancer risk
varies by expression of immune markers within tumors may inform the biologic mechanisms possibly involved
(e.g. CD3, CD8, CD4, CD69, FOXP3, CD163). Here we propose to evaluate the association between IUD use
and ovarian cancer risk in 17 case control studies and 7 cohort studies with a total of more than 20,000 cases
that collected, with varying degrees of detail, data on IUD type and timing of use (e.g. age at use and
before/after first birth), as well as detailed histologic data critical for distinguishing ovarian cancer subtypes.
Importantly, our proposed research includes a case-control study of African American women enrolled
between 2010-2015, reflecting recent contraceptive trends and increasing diversity. The inclusion of cohort
studies with updated contraceptive use data and a case-control study which recently completed enrollment will
provide information on the contemporary contraceptive use. Furthermore, we will utilize unique resources and
innovative platforms to examine the potential mechanisms through which contraceptive choice influences
ovarian cancer risk. In more than 3,000 cases with detailed contraceptive data, we will simultaneously measure
a panel of immune markers by multiplex immunofluorescence which shows co-localization of marker
expression. Both the high prevalence and modifiable nature of contraceptive use make this an important
public health question with a significant impact on the population burden of ovarian cancer."
10833574,"Black-White inequities in healthy aging are well-known with Black adults experiencing greater risk of
developing and earlier onset of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, and
diabetes compared to White adults. Neighborhood context has emerged as a potentially powerful determinant
of racial inequities in aging-related health conditions, including cognitive decline, and may be a key intervention
site. Neighborhoods include both social and environmental exposures important for healthy aging. Evidence
indicates stark racial inequities in exposure to segregated, under-resourced but over-surveilled and polluted
neighborhoods. Pollution and aspects of social adversity are often correlated and may operate cumulatively to
result in racial health inequities. Importantly, however, these chemical (i.e. pollution) and non-chemical (i.e.,
social adversity) stressors may act synergistically, whereby exposure to social adversity can heighten
vulnerability to the deleterious health impact of even low levels of pollution. Yet, the environmental and social
science literatures – even the environmental and social epidemiology literatures – are largely separate. There
is a pressing need to integrate the study of these exposures given their likely cumulative and synergistic effects
on racial health inequities in order to direct effective interventions and policies. In addition to the gaps in our
knowledge about the combined impact of chemical and non-chemical stressors on racial inequities in healthy
aging, there is a need to focus on outcomes that may serve as biological pathways to numerous diseases.
Research on either pollution or social adversity has tended to focus on specific health outcomes. Focus on a
single disease may underestimate the overall health impact of these racially unequal exposures. It is critical to
clarify the shared biological mechanisms that underlie numerous chronic diseases to understand the full impact
of pollution and social adversity on racial health inequities. A growing literature points to the importance of
epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, linking socioenvironmental context to health. Indeed, it may
be that epigenetic processes are an important mechanism through which inequities in both air pollution and
social adversity are embodied. Our objective is to identify underlying DNA methylation mechanisms linking
neighborhood segregation and ambient and industrial air pollution and social adversity to measures of healthy
aging. Clarifying the role of neighborhood in racial health inequities is critical, as neighborhoods are amenable
to intervention. Identifying the role of DNA methylation patterns reflecting racial segregation, including chemical
and non-chemical stressors, can point to specific disease etiologies and causal mechanisms effective
interventions to eliminate racial inequities in healthy aging."
10829402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) associated with menopause consist of rapid and intense sweating,
peripheral vasodilation, and an exaggerated feeling of internal heat. Over 70% of women experience hot
flashes at some point during menopause, which significantly impacts day to day life. Furthermore, hot flash
frequency is related to increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), sleep, and mood
disorders--even when controlling for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (obesity, hypertension,
lipids, etc.). As such, the overall goal of this application is to determine autonomic neurovascular function in
midlife women with and without vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). For the purposes of this application we will
define neurovascular function as a concept that encompasses sympathetic outflow, the responses of blood
vessels to neurotransmitters released by the sympathetic nerves and the intrinsic properties of the vascular
endothelium and smooth muscle. It is thus related to the regulation of tissue blood flow. In this context,
neurovascular function is critically important to women’s health and aging. Aim 1 will compare microvascular
function in women with objectively assessed low and high frequency hot flashes. Aim 2 will determine
autonomic function and reactivity in women with objectively assessed low and high frequency hot flashes.
Finally, Aim 3 will characterize cerebrovascular function in women with objectively assessed low and high
frequency hot flashes. Importantly, this work will provide the first comprehensive and mechanistic evaluation of
autonomic and neurovascular function in midlife women including those undergoing menopause.
Understanding how the neurovascular physiology of women relates to hot flashes will inform hypertension and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment and prevention options, as the presence of hot flashes are a CVD risk
factor beyond traditional CVD risk factors and as such, is likely to be an important determinant for a woman’s
health. Thus, the Applicant’s long-term goal is to develop interventions to reduce the incidence of
cardiovascular disease in women with hot flashes. The proposed studies will build on the Applicant’s previous
training and the mentorship team, formal course work on running clinical trials, and technical training plan will
provide opportunities to gain additional knowledge in a new area and learn new experimental techniques and
approaches. Finally, this work will generate an investigative niche that will complement the Applicant’s
intellectual and technical skills that will facilitate the launch of her independent career."
10805490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pathogens have evolved to co-opt cellular functions to support their replication and spread while inactivating
innate immune mechanisms that restrict their growth. Discovery and characterization of cellular components that
regulate pathogenesis hold promise for revealing new approaches to treat infectious diseases. Enteroviruses
(EVs) comprise a large genus of single-stranded RNA viruses of positive polarity whose members cause a
number of important human diseases such as poliomyelitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid paralysis and the common
cold. How EVs co-opt cellular functions to promote replication and cause pathogenesis is incompletely
understood. Through robust, unbiased knockout screening approaches, we have discovered that the protein
methyltransferase SETD3 is required for infection by a broad range of human EVs. We showed that enterovirus
replication is severely hampered in human cells lacking SETD3 and that the block occurs during the RNA
replication step. SETD3 is a methyltransferase that mono-methylates actin, thereby regulating actin function.
However, we found that methyltransferase activity of SETD3 is not required for its role in viral replication
indicating that enteroviruses’ reliance on SETD3 is independent of actin methylation. We further showed that
SETD3 interacts with the viral nonstructural 2A protein of several enteroviruses. SETD3 is critically important for
in vivo pathogenesis as we show that Setd3-/- mice are completely protected from lethal intracranial inoculation
with EV-A71 in a neonate model. These findings demonstrate that SETD3 controls pathogenesis for a large class
of viruses with a strong impact on human health including non-polio EVs that can cause severe neurological
symptoms (EV-A71, EV-D68). In this application, we will determine the specific role of SETD3 in viral RNA
replication, structurally characterize the interaction between SETD3 and 2A, and test the hypothesis that
SETD3’s interactions with viral nonstructural proteins are a novel molecular mechanism by which EVs hijack
cellular machinery to enable genome amplification. Furthermore, to study the in vivo role of SETD3 in a mouse
model that recapitulates more faithfully the transmission cycle and pathogenesis of enteric enteroviruses, we will
develop and apply an oral infection model of EV-A71 in immune-competent mice. Our results will provide details
on the molecular mechanisms by which host factors promote enteroviral RNA replication, reveal how non-
catalytic functions of methyltransferases act in microbial pathogenesis and uncover the in vivo role of SETD3 in
promoting EV-A71 replication in diverse cell types involved in initial replication, systemic spread and ultimately
in neuropathogenesis."
10808123,"B cells play an important role regulating immune responses. B cell deficiency or depletion in mice can worsen
autoimmunity and prevent allograft tolerance. We showed that TIM-1 is a broad marker for IL-10+ regulatory B
cells (Bregs) and that anti-TIM-1 induces tolerance through induction of IL-10+ Bregs. Based on this discovery,
our collaborator Dr. Kuchroo, has just shown that TIM-1 regulates various inhibitory molecules on B cells in
addition to IL-10, and that mice specifically lacking B cell-TIM-1 develop spontaneous systemic autoimmunity.
This unequivocally demonstrates a critical role for Bregs in maintaining tolerance. In general agreement,
tolerant human renal allograft recipients demonstrate a “Breg profile” and peri-transplant depletion of B cells
increased acute rejection and vasculopathy after renal and cardiac transplantation, respectively. Despite these
advances, our understanding of Bregs remains in its infancy. First, there is no agreement even about which B
cells carry out Breg function, why Bregs in different studies belong to different subsets, or even whether
plasma cells (PCs), and not B cells per se, actually carry out Breg function. Second, little is known about how
Bregs are regulated in vivo, or what signals can be used to expand them. Based on our and our collaborator’s
advances, this proposal, will directly address both of these major gaps. The field has been hampered because
Bregs are rare and their prior best marker, IL-10, was only detected after stimulation of B cells ex vivo.
Transfer of various B cell subsets can inhibit inflammation in transplant and autoimmune models. However,
these subsets are suppressive because they contain a relatively high proportion of IL-10+ B cells in a given
model, rather than representing a true Breg phenotype. Only 5-15% of B cells in such subsets express IL-10,
and each subset comprises <20% of all IL-10+ B cells. As a result, the field has identified a myriad of different
Breg ""subsets” (often minor or immature), and there is no consensus as to their function. However, using IL-
10-GFP reporter mice, we recently demonstrated that IL-10+ B cells can be directly identified without in vitro
culture. Moreover, on a protein level, canonical Follicular B cells (FOB), Marginal Zone B cells (MZB) and PCs
each account for ~30% of all B-lineage IL-10. We hypothesize that Bregs belonging to these canonical subsets
that have distinct localization in the SLO, have different functions. In AIM 1, using purified IL-10+ or TIM-1+
Bregs belonging to these 3 subsets, we will now directly determine whether they regulate the same or different
aspects of the immune response (e.g. humoral vs. cellular). While PCs were reported to be essential for Breg
function, we found that mice unable to generate PCs due to B cell-specific deletion of BLIMP-1 exhibit a
regulated phenotype with improved allograft survival and less severe EAE, and a marked increase in both
frequency and number of IL-10+ and TIM-1+ Bregs. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will identify how changes in
BLIMP-1, PCs, and the microbiota interact to regulate Breg numbers in vivo. This work will greatly enhance our
understanding of B cell and Breg biology and provide therapeutic insights highly relevant to allograft tolerance."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer does not develop in isolation, evolving instead in a complex milieu of reactive stroma and immune cells
that constitute the tumor microenvironment. Dynamic interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs), immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to enhance tumor growth, initiate
the metastatic cascade, and promote treatment resistance in a variety of cancers. Therapeutic advances have
confirmed the incredible potential of targeting the tumor microenvironment but also identified unexpected
heterogeneity in response and diverse mechanisms of resistance. Therefore, it is the mission of the Tumor
Microenvironment (TM) Program to identify microenvironmental changes that occur during tumorigenesis and
analyze how the interactions between the tumor cell and microenvironmental components affect tumor formation,
growth, metastasis, and response to therapies. Through these research efforts, members of the TM program are
identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches. To accomplish these goals, the TM program fosters
collaborations between its 33 members from 14 departments across campus, which include biologists,
bioengineers, and clinicians. The TM program is pursuing three Specific Aims, with an emphasis on UWCCC
priority targets breast and prostate cancer due to their high prevalence in our catchment:
Aim 1: Dissect the role of the extracellular matrix in tumor initiation and metastasis.
Aim 2: Analyze multi-cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment during tumor initiation and
metastasis.
Aim 3: Interrogate the biological interactions in the tumor microenvironment that mediate treatment response
and resistance.
TM members were supported by $3.5 million direct costs in NCI funding and $5.1 million direct costs in additional
peer-reviewed cancer-related support in the last budget year, and were highly productive with 696 cancer-
relevant publications during the course of the last grant cycle. Of these publications, 17% were intra-
programmatic collaborations and 32% were inter-programmatic collaborations, increases from the previous
cycle. In the year 2021 alone, nearly half of publications were collaborative with other institutions."

PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Viruses cause at least 15% of human cancers. In the VR program, we study how viruses infect, replicate, persist,
and cause tumors, as well as how we can prevent, diagnose, and treat virally-induced cancers. Our 17 highly
collaborative members study all 7 human tumor viruses, play significant leadership roles in the University of
Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) as well as the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, and
derive great benefit from UWCCC colleagues, shared services, and pilot funding. We recruited 4 new members,
our externally awarded funding has increased every year since 2017, and >90% of our faculty members have
active extramural funding. The program project grant (P01CA022443) that supports many of our investigators
was renewed for years 41-45 with a perfect priority score of 10. Our two-way community engagement and
outreach has expanded, and we continue to be a driving force in training the current and next generation of
cancer biologists and virologists, and in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusivity initiatives. Previously we
received an Exceptional to Outstanding rating, attenuated from Exceptional only by a desire for more intra-
programmatic publications and translational work, and because we had yet to participate in a clinical trial. Since
that rating, we have increased our intra-programmatic publications by 63%, and reinvigorated our translational
work into a thriving and expanding pipeline resulting in one current and one future clinical trial. Our significant
achievements, and our clear plans to sustain and advance our important mission, are detailed in the Specific
Aims and Research Strategy pages that follow."
10873046,"PROJECT SUMMARY – COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
The mission of the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) Office is to reduce the burden of cancer and
cancer health disparities across Wisconsin through impactful outreach and community engagement spanning
the cancer control continuum from prevention to survivorship. The Specific Aims of COE are: (Aim 1) increase
understanding of the cancer burden in Wisconsin with a focus on achieving health equity; (Aim 2) foster mutually
beneficial community relationships and engage communities in research; and (Aim 3) disseminate and
implement evidence-based interventions and policy recommendations. Motivated by our growing reach
throughout the state clinically and through expansion of our impactful research and outreach activities, the choice
of the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) catchment as the state of Wisconsin resulted
from internal strategic planning and recommendations by our External Advisory Board and Community Advocacy
Boards. The UWCCC prioritizes, invests in, and mobilizes research and outreach efforts that: reduces the
greatest burden of cancer across the catchment; leverages the novel scientific strengths and expertise at the
UWCCC; and addresses cancer types (breast, prostate, head and neck, and leukemia/myeloma) and their risk
factors (smoking, alcohol drinking, HPV vaccination) where rates in Wisconsin are greater than in the U.S.
overall, notably African American, American Indian, and rural residents. To achieve our aims, COE links basic,
clinical, translational, and population scientists with community members through routine structured forums and
individual guidance to build the evidence base for interventions that benefit our catchment area and beyond.
Expanding infrastructure draws upon the relationships between COE personnel and UWCCC senior leaders,
leaders of training and diversity efforts, clinical care and research teams, and statewide research and outreach
partners including faith-based organizations, advocacy groups, affiliated health systems, and regional networks.
Multiple impactful efforts demonstrate how the COE Office has leveraged the expertise and resources of the
UWCCC for statewide impact including exponential statewide case submission to the Precision Medicine
Molecular Tumor Board, numerous effective tobacco cessation interventions for at-risk individuals and cancer
patients, powerful media campaigns, substantive increases in clinical trial recruitment among historically
underrepresented populations, and successful influence on policy changes through cooperative relationships
with state lawmakers. Collaborative relationships with our Community Advocacy Boards, diversity and equity
leaders, Statewide UW Extension partners, and the State’s Comprehensive Cancer Control Program maximize
our ability to ensure our research reflects the voices and needs of our catchment. The COE leadership team has
over two decades of community-engaged participatory research experience. A reimagined COE strategic plan
provides an innovative framework for COE activities and guideposts for evaluating progress towards our common
vision and shared goals for defeating cancer and achieving cancer health equity across Wisconsin and beyond."
10783747,"Project Summary
 Remarkably, our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to cytoskeletal alterations and the phenotypic
impact of these alterations in aging cells remains very limited. We have identified and begun characterizing key
proteins required to maintain normal nuclear morphology, including two novel proteins (LRRC49 and C11orf49)
that assemble into a tubulin poly-glutamylase (TPG) complex. We have recently shown that each protein
regulates both tubulin glutamylation and nuclear morphology, and ablation of these genes alters post-
translational modifications (PTM) of tubulin, cytoskeletal networks, and nuclear shape. Since similar
cytoskeletal and nuclear defects are also observed in cells obtained from patients with the premature aging
syndrome, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), this prompted us to hypothesize that specific
defects in PTMs and microtubule networks could be associated with aging. Furthermore, it is known that levels
of SUN1, a component of the LINC (Linkers of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex that connects the
cytoskeleton and the nucleoskeleton, are altered during normal and premature aging. However, it is unknown
whether altered SUN1 levels are a cause or consequence of aging. We will pursue two Aims that combine
biochemical and cell biological approaches to (1) investigate a global role for defects in microtubule networks
and alterations in tubulin glutamylation and SUN1 levels during physiological aging and in progeroid cells, and
(2) identify how defects associated with normal and premature aging are translated into genome-wide changes
in chromatin topology. Here, we will specifically focus on how the TPG and SUN1 protein globally regulate
microtubule networks and nuclear assembly during aging. Our studies will address fundamental questions
related to the role of SUN1 and tubulin modifications in nuclear shape changes and in physiological and
pathological models of aging, and our studies will determine whether these alterations are a cause or
consequence of aging. Our studies will also provide insights into the changes in chromatin topology sustained
by cells that age through normal or pathological mechanisms."
10811621,"Project Summary
Information in the nervous system is relayed mostly at synapses, where neurotransmitter is released with great
temporal precision from a presynaptic terminal via the fusion of membrane-bound synaptic vesicles (SVs) with
the plasma membrane (PM), in a process called exocytosis. Components of these SVs are subsequently
retrieved via endocytosis and recycled for reuse. This grant aims to understand the interplay between SV
recycling and membrane tension gradients and associated membrane flows.
In neurons and neuroendocrine cells, both exo- and endocytosis are influenced by osmotic forces, suggesting
they are influenced by membrane tension, 𝜎𝜎. Conversely, membrane addition to the PM via exocytosis is
expected to lower 𝜎𝜎, while endocytosis should restore it. In addition, 𝜎𝜎 has been suggested to be a possible
signal for coupling exo- to endocytosis. Despite these key roles, there are no measurements of 𝜎𝜎 in synaptic
terminals and how 𝜎𝜎 changes are related to exo-endocytosis is not known, mainly due to technical difficulties.
The best method to probe 𝜎𝜎 is to pull a thin membrane tether from the PM using optical tweezers; the tether
force reflects 𝜎𝜎. However, most terminals are small and tightly coupled to post-synaptic structures, making
tether pulling impractical. We overcome this challenge using fish bipolar neurons which possess giant
terminals, in a setup that combines optical tweezers with electrophysiology or photostimulation and with high-
resolution fluorescence microscopy. We aim to 1) characterize PM flows at neuronal presynaptic terminals.
After stimulation, membrane added at an exocytic site needs to flow (and the associated 𝜎𝜎 perturbation
propagate) over the cell surface, then through the tether to produce a change in the measured tether force. We
will characterize membrane flows. 2) Determine mechanisms of cell membrane flow regulation by the
cytoskeleton. We found that F-actin is a major regulator of PM-cytoskeleton drag, but how it interacts with the
PM at terminals and activity-dependent changes in its structure are not understood. We will characterize F-
actin rearrangements upon stimulation at the optical and electron microscopy levels. 3) Establish the
relationship between tension changes in response to stimulation, membrane flow, and exo-endocytosis
coupling. We will confirm that 𝜎𝜎 changes we observed in preliminary experiments are due to exo-endocytosis
and map the spatiotemporal relationship between exo- and endocyosis sites as a function of membrane flow to
test the idea that exo-endocytosis coupling may depend on membrane flow. 4) Do electromechanical effect
matter for exo- or endocytosis? We observed rapid voltage-induced tether force changes consistent with
electromechanical effects. The relevance of these effects to exo-endocytosis is not known. We will characterize
electromechanical effects and determine whether they may play a role during exo-endocytosis.
Overall, these measurements will help generate a model of feedback between membrane trafficking and
membrane flows."

Research on perceptual learning (PL) has been dominated by studies that seek to isolate and improve individual
visual processes. However, an important translational outcome of PL research is to address the needs of patients
with vision loss, who seek to improve performance on daily tasks such as reading, navigation, and face
recognition. These more ecological cases of behavioral change and cortical plasticity, which are inherently
complex and integrative, have revealed significant gaps in a more holistic understanding of how multiple visual
processes and their associated brain systems jointly contribute to durable and generalizable PL. To address
these gaps, here we study simulated and natural central vision loss. We focus on macular degeneration (MD),
one of the most common causes of vision loss (projected to affect 248 million people worldwide by 2040), which
results from damage to photoreceptors in the macula that disrupts central vision. Such central vision loss is a
superb lens through which study to how ecologically relevant changes in the use of vision relate to changing
brain activity and connectivity because it represents a massive alteration in visual experience requiring reliance
on peripheral vision for daily tasks. With the use of eye-trackers and gaze-contingent displays that induce central
scotomas, central vision loss can be simulated in normally seeing individuals, who then develop peripheral
looking patterns that resemble compensatory vision strategies seen in MD patients. Ideal use of peripheral vision
requires improvement in multiple vision domains, three of the most important being: early visual processing (e.g.,
visual sensitivity), mid-level visual processing (e.g., spatial integration), and attention and eye-movements. To
date, no study has systematically investigated these three domains of PL and their neural underpinnings. The
proposed research plan rests on rigorous prior work showing that PL influences multiple brain structures and
functions related to these three domains. We propose a novel approach of systematically measuring how
different training regimes related to the three domains influence a broad range of psychophysical and ecological
behaviors (Aim 1), how these changes arise from plasticity in brain structure and function (Aim 2), and how PL
after simulated central vision loss compares to PL in MD (Aim 3). This work is significant and innovative as it will
be the first integrated study of PL characterizing multiple trainable factors and their impact on diverse behavioral
outcomes and on cutting-edge assessments of neural representations and dynamics. It is also the first study to
directly compare PL in MD patients with PL in a controlled model system of central visual field loss with simulated
scotomas, which if validated will allow the use of this model system to interrogate MD in larger samples of healthy
individuals. We will also share a unique dataset that will help the field to understand behavioral and neural
plasticity after central vision loss and individual differences in responsiveness to training. Finally, this work will
illuminate basic mechanisms of brain plasticity after sensory loss that may generalize to other forms of
rehabilitation after peripheral or central damage."
10800722,"Project Summary
The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how host metabolic adaptations during infection promote co-
operative defenses between a host and enteric pathogens to drive asymptomatic carriage and the eventual
evolution of commensalism. The proposed studies utilize a natural in vivo host-pathogen involving a enteric
bacterial pathogen that causes infectious colitis. In previous work, the Ayres lab discovered that host
micronutrient metabolic adaptations during infection with enteric pathogens, regulates host carbohydrate
metabolism leading to a phenomenon the Ayres lab calls “metabolic bribery”. This involves the allocation of
carbohydrates to the niche of the pathogen (intestine) to increase availability for the pathogen to metabolize.
The Ayres lab discovered that the metabolism of these specific carbohydrates by the pathogen suppressed
pathogen virulence and disease, indicating this micronutrient regulation of host and pathogen macronutrient
metabolism acts as an anti-virulence mechanism. In the new proposal, the Ayres lab presents exciting data
demonstrating that micronutrient metabolism coordinates interactions between host glucose and lipid
metabolism to suppress virulence and promote cooperation with enteric pathogens. The proposed studies will
investigate the mechanisms by which dietary micronutrients regulate macronutrient metabolism to suppress
pathogen virulence to yield asymptomatic carriers of the pathogen. The proposed studies will focus on
understanding how micronutrient metabolism orchestrates glucose and lipid processes in the body to suppress
pathogen virulence. The proposed studies will then examine the interplay between the adaptive immune
response and micronutrient mediated cooperative defenses, elucidating how these two systems cooperate to
mediate healthy host-pathogen interactions and protect from infectious colitis. Finally, the proposed studies will
utilize this novel host-pathogen/micronutrient system to elucidate the mechanisms that drive the evolution of
pathogen attenuation towards commensalism and persistence within the microbiota. This work will contribute
to a better understanding for gastrointestinal mucosal adaptive immunology, mechanisms of acute and chronic
gastrointestinal inflammation and colitis, the effects of gastrointestinal microbes and microbial metabolism on
gastrointestinal health and disease, including the effects of pathogenic bacterial pathogens."

accomplish this goal. Drawing on the solid mentorship skills of 35 nationally renowned and highly collaborative
faculty with primary appointments in 10 academic and clinical departments, the UCSF MSK Training Program
provides rigorous research training in basic and clinical/translational sciences important to the study of MSK
diseases. These 35 participating faculty members bring multi-disciplined expertise that reflects areas of rapidly
expanding research development such as stem cells, neurobiology, tissue regeneration, molecular physiology,
and artificial intelligence. A vital aspect of the program is to focus exclusively on preparing postdoctoral trainees
for independent research careers. The program proposes three slots for postdoctoral trainees, including two
slots for Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows (research training duration of two years) and one slot for physician trainees
from our research-track residency program in Orthopaedic Surgery (research training duration of one year). The
central component of the training experience is direct research in the basic laboratory or clinical/translational
research group of a primary research mentor. The training experience fuses this scientific training with sustained,
individualized, and goal-oriented mentorship that guides trainees along the pathway to gaining their competitive
research funding. The program includes formal coursework in ethics, rigor and reproducibility, statistical analysis,
and grant-writing. It will also emphasize basic and clinical/translational science education by drawing on
significant curricular activities designed explicitly for MSK science; innovative research experiences with an
emphasis on scientific rigor and translation; individualized development plans that utilize evidence-based
approaches for career planning; numerous exposures to state-of-the-art methods and techniques through weekly
grand rounds and invited lectures, monthly research-in-progress seminars, journal clubs, and an annual retreat;
and scientific communication through formal expectations of publications and presentations at national meetings.
These activities capitalize on the programmatic and scientific infrastructure created by several existing MSK-
related centers and institutes with UCSF-wide participation and influence. Overall, the training enabled by this
program will attract and prepare junior scientists with the goal of understanding the mechanistic basis of MSK
diseases, finding new therapies for these diseases, and ensuring that scientific discoveries lead to advances in
public health in an equitable and cost-effective manner. In doing so, the program will ensure that a cadre of
young scientists will pursue academic careers in MSK research and advance the field in fundamental ways."

10799601,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly half of individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have a comorbid anxiety disorder (AD), which
is associated with treatment resistance, morbidity, and mortality. Yet, the underlying process dysfunctions that
characterize comorbid AD and MDD (AD-MDD) are poorly understood. The premise of this proposal is that
exaggerated threat sensitivity in general, and potential threat vs acute threat in particular differentiates AD-
MDD from MDD. This project builds on our pilot data showing that people with AD-MDD have exaggerated
threat sensitivity compared to those with MDD across several levels (self-report, startle electromyogram
[EMG], functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] and behavioral), and aims to delineate and quantify the
neural circuit dysfunctions underlying threat sensitivity (potential and acute threat) in AD-MDD relative to MDD
and AD. If confirmed, the proposed studies would provide behavioral, neural, and electrophysiological
processes that can be used for both quantitative severity assessment and as a treatment target for AD-MDD.
Whereas both AD-MDD and MDD individuals show blunted reward and interoceptive/salience processing, only
AD-MDD show exaggerated threat sensitivity. However, the neural basis for threat sensitivity is complex and
consists of both potential threat (PT; “anxiety”) and acute threat (AT; “fear”) related processes, which involve
different circuits, that have not been examined in AD-MDD. This proposal focuses on this crucial gap to better
delineate the neural circuitry. Benzodiazepines are common anxiolytics which are GABAergic agonists and
reduce PT rather than AT. We propose to use the benzodiazepine Lorazepam, as an acute pharmacological
probe to causally study threat circuitry and delineate neural mechanisms contributing to AD-MDD, MDD and
AD. This proposal's aims focus on: (1) probing differences in PT and AT at multiple levels of analysis between
AD-MDD, MDD and AD; and (2) determining how pharmacological manipulation targeting PT differs in its acute
neurological, electrophysiological and behavioral effects on AD-MDD vs MDD vs AD. We propose: (1) the
interaction of increased threat sensitivity and reward/salience blunting contributes to unique neural
and behavioral responses that are associated with greater disease burden for AD-MDD than MDD; and
(2) this sensitivity in AD-MDD is mechanistically related to specific neural activation changes in
targetable circuits associated with PT. This mechanistic R01 uses a benzodiazepine within an experimental
medicine model approach to causally modulate the threat processing system and associated circuits in AD-
MDD (N=55), MDD (N=55), and AD (N=55). In a crossover design, participants will receive a single 1mg dose
of Lorazepam and Placebo and complete threat tasks that delineate PT/AT during eyeblink startle EMG (Aim
1/3) and fMRI (Aim 2/3). The ultimate goal of this research is to establish treatment targets for AD-MDD for
novel interventions and provide evidence for the separation of MDD and AD-MDD in future clinical trials."

However, research and training has largely been siloed. This multidisciplinary training program is breaking
down those silos for the next generation of researchers. We recruit a mix of fellows in BPS and HCI. Fellows
develop core competencies in digital mental health, team science, research methods, mental health equity,
leadership, as well as other topics as needed such as implementation science or computer science. Fellows
expand their skills in their research domain, and also develop a working understanding of the methods and
principles in the complementary domain that the fellow is learning (e.g. BPS for HCI fellows, HCI design
methods for BPS fellows). Each trainee is co-mentored by a faculty member who specializes in BPS research
and one specializing in HCI. At least 75% of the fellow’s time is spent in mentored research. To support these
research activities, the program offers seminars, professional development activities, workshops, and other
didactic experiences to prepare the fellow for a successful research career. The program is housed in
Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, and supported by faculty and programs from the
McCormick School of Engineering, and the School of Communication, which together provide a rich training
experience. Fellows have access to the wide range of educational resources made available by Northwestern,
including grant writing workshops, paper writing seminars, team science training, and other resources
dedicated to career development. This program was the first in the nation to jointly train mental health and
technology specialists, and serves as a model for the emerging field of digital mental health. We propose to
admit 2 fellows each year for a two year fellowship."
10733455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Modification of autologous T cells with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) molecules was first proposed nearly 30
years ago as a therapy for people living with HIV. Since then, CAR-T cells have emerged as a potent and highly
successful therapy for liquid tumors, while HIV-specific CAR-T cells have only begun to show efficacy in large
animal models and clinical trials. Based on our longstanding interest in CAR-T cell therapies for HIV, we posit
three primary barriers that limit the curative potential of this approach. First, low levels of HIV-1 antigen at the
cell surface (namely Env protein), especially during antiretroviral therapy (ART), render latently infected cells
nearly invisible to CAR-T cells and other virus-specific immune effectors. Second, the wealth of knowledge
regarding cellular trafficking of the viral Env protein has yet to be thoroughly applied in the context of Env-
dependent HIV cure strategies. Third, CAR-T cell persistence and function wane over time, prior to complete
clearance of the latent HIV reservoir. Our groundbreaking preliminary data outlines a path to overcome these
limitations. We recently reported findings in four rhesus macaques that were infected with an HIV-like virus,
suppressed by ART and then infused with virus-specific CAR-T cells containing the CD4 extracellular domain
(CD4CAR). To expand these potent antiviral effectors in vivo, animals were next boosted with an irradiated cell
line stably expressing HIV-1 Env. Following ART treatment interruption (ATI), viral control was observed in 2 of
4 animals, consistent with robust and Env-dependent expansion of CD4CAR-T cells. The central goal of this
proposal is to increase the potency and feasibility of this approach. In AIM 1, we will transition our Env boosting
strategy from an immortalized cell line to an FDA-approved mRNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) platform,
analogous to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Env immunogens will be optimized
for CD4CAR T cell interactions and developed as Env mRNA-LNP vaccines. In AIM 2, we will use CRISPR-
Cas9 gene editing to extend the durability and function of CD4CAR-T cells. We will compare a series of CAR
products that carry inactivated immune checkpoint alleles, which we hypothesize will support more durable
function and efficiently clear persistent viral reservoirs. In AIM 3, we will benchmark Env mRNA-LNP and immune
checkpoint gene editing strategies in our vetted nonhuman primate (NHP) model of HIV gene therapy. These
experiments will feature a powerful competitive repopulation study design, providing critical information on basic
CAR biology that cannot be gathered in clinical studies. Together, these aims build on what we believe to be the
most promising anti-HIV cell and gene therapy approach reported to date. Our unique and highly informative
NHP model of HIV persistence and CAR-T cell therapy will fill in critical gaps in knowledge regarding CAR-T cell
safety and function in limited antigen environments, and facilitate clinical translation both in developed and
developing nations. The lessons we learn from these studies will be applicable not only as a curative therapy for
HIV-1, but for a range of diseases such as solid tumors where CAR-T cell therapies must be similarly augmented."
10846818,"Project Summary
The proposed research is focused on applying biophysical methods to understand the structure and function of
RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Our investigations will elucidate
unexplored steps in the spliceosome assembly pathway, mRNA decay and RNA silencing. We propose to
determine the structure of the U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U6 snRNP) particle and to describe how it
associates with the U4 snRNP to form the U4/U6 di-snRNP. These interactions are critical for assembly and
recycling of the spliceosome but are not yet understood at the molecular level. We will also investigate the Lsm1-
7 complex, which is highly related to U6 snRNP proteins but directs mRNA decay, a major post-transcriptional
determinant of steady-state levels of gene expression. Our recent data suggest the Lsm1-7 complex is
remodeled by its cofactor Pat1 in order to bind to a broad range of mRNAs. Finally, we will explore a newly
discovered area of RNA biology involving the enzymatic addition of poly-UG (pUG) tails to RNA 3¢ ends. pUG-
tailed RNAs are potent agents of gene silencing and establish the molecular memories required for trans-
generational epigenetic inheritance in nematodes. We have discovered that pUG RNAs fold into an unusual
quadruplex structure that explains the length requirement for RNA silencing in vivo. Humans have over a
thousand internal pUG sequences within neuronal introns, which serve to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing
through interactions with the protein TDP-43. We have discovered that pUG RNAs maintain their quadruplex
structure when bound to TDP-43, the latter of which is involved in phase transitions and neurodegenerative
disease. We will investigate the structural basis for this interaction and will collaboratively test our hypothesis in
animals. By elucidating how pUG RNAs associate with proteins and small molecules we will better understand
how these interactions direct distinct biological outcomes in diverse pathways such as RNA silencing and
alternative splicing."

The Imaging and Image Analysis Core will perform mRNAs spatial and cellular localization and expression levels
analyses, immunofluorescence, as well as quantitative label free fibrosis imaging on human lung tissues-based
investigations for each one of the Projects. Samples from specific functional lung regions of extensively
phenotyped IPF lungs represent a unique resource that will benefit all three Projects in the Program, and these
specimens will need to be carefully stained and imaged for mRNA and protein identification and quantification
accumulation to assess ER stress, autophagy, UPR, cell senescence, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Centralization of
advanced staining and microscopic imaging will also benefit all Projects by providing quality-controlled data for
Project-specific investigations, thus improving the opportunity for inter-project collaboration and integration. This
Core is therefore an essential integrative component of the Program.
The Aims of the Imaging and Image Analysis Core include:
 • Design staining combinations and perform regions selection for whole transcriptome analysis with
 Nanostring GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler.
 • Perform RNAscope in situ hybridization and microscopic imaging of IPF and control lung tissue to
 complement, validate, and contextualize the transcriptional profiles obtained by RNA-seq analyses and
 to address other project-specific needs.
 • Perform label-free second harmonic generation imaging of fibrillar collagens for fibrosis quantification.
 • Perform analyses and quantification of microscopic images.
 • Provide Digital Whole Slide Images storage in conjunction with the Data Management and Analysis Core
 (Core D).
The Imaging and Image Analysis Core will be led by Evgenia Dobrinskikh, PhD who will coordinate, overview,

The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) is designed to provide a shared resource for data
management and analysis across projects, and to facilitate the integration and sharing of data and analytic
resources. By centralizing these activities, we will ensure the integrity of the data produced by each project,
create efficiencies through sharing of data and analytic resources, and provide biostatistical consultation that
incorporates an in-depth knowledge of pulmonary fibrosis etiology. This strategy will also allow us to coordinate
study design and data management issues, leading to a more coherent approach to data analysis, as well as
significant cost savings The Core Lead (Peljto) will supervise a team that is experienced in the conduct of studies
involving multidisciplinary research. The team also has the skill set required to manage complex issues of study
design, multifaceted database management, genomics, and broad quantitative methods. The key activities of
the DMAC will be 1) providing study design consultation and refinement, 2) providing a secure, central repository
and quality control for data generated, 3) conducting biostatistical and bioinformatics analyses to test proposed
hypotheses 4) facilitating integration and sharing of Project data and analytic resources. These activities will
directly serve all four projects through study design consultation and analysis. In addition, the DMAC will work
closely with Cores B and C to transfer, annotate, and store data and digital images generated for each Project.
Finally, this Core will coordinate with the Administrative Core, as it provides the administrative and organizational
structure to support this Program, and will receive direction from the Administrative Core. This Core will interact
with the Administrative Core and Project Investigators at regular meetings, such that each week Dr. Peljto and
appropriate DMAC members will meet with either an individual Project team or the entire Program. These
activities of the Core will assist all of the Projects and the Administrative Core in fulfilling their research, reporting,
and resource sharing goals and obligations"

Accumulating evidence from studies in rodents suggests that emotional reactions to threatening stimuli rely on
neurophysiological changes within an anxiety-processing network that includes the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) [1]. Since rodent studies often use
laboratory animal models (similar to healthy humans) it is unclear whether findings will translate to the human
mPFC-BLA-vHPC network especially in individuals with various levels of anxiety such as post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The proposed project will implement a first-of-its-kind
platform for intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recording and intracranial electrical stimulation (iES) of
mPFC-BLA-vHPC oscillatory activity during laboratory and naturalistic fear-based tasks using immersive virtual
reality (VR) technology and wearable biometric sensors capable of recording physiology (eye-blinks, heart rate
variability [HRV], skin conductance response [SCR], and pupil size). Through an interdisciplinary collaboration
between UCLA and the Veteran’s Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS) the
proposed project will have access to 80 epilepsy participants implanted with mPFC, BLA, and/or vHPC depth
electrodes with varying levels of dysregulatory anxiety-related processing. Since our studies address basic
questions about the role of mPFC-BLA-vHPC oscillations in human fear and anxiety, the results will bridge
findings across species and lay the scientific foundation for helping future patients with debilitating anxiety
disorders."
10916204,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT THREE
Treatment strategies for intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) include surgery or
radiation with or without hormonal therapy. Multiple molecular factors, including germline and somatic
alterations in DNA repair genes and tissue-based transcriptional biomarkers, have biological and prognostic
relevance in these clinical settings yet are rarely used today to guide treatment decisions. Determination of
the interacting and co- occurring molecular features that jointly drive indolent or aggressive clinical outcomes
in this setting is urgently needed to enable molecularly guided therapeutic strategies and biologically
grounded predictive models for clinical use. Furthermore, complex molecular states may converge on
histopathological patterns to augment these predictions, but these properties are difficult to quantify,
integrate, and generalize across diverse patient populations. The advent of large and diverse patient cohorts
with clinically embedded molecular characterization, digital histopathology techniques, and key outcome
measures, along with innovations in computation and deep learning to analyze and interpret these data, has
created an opportunity to profoundly expand the discovery and translational potential of molecular,
pathologic, and phenotypic data for patients with localized PCa. Our overarching hypothesis is that
interacting molecular, pathologic, and phenotypic features define prognostic outcomes in intermediate and
high-risk localized PCa after surgery, and that biologically guided interpretable deep learning, paired with
harmonized cohorts representative of PCa diversity, will transform our understanding of indolent versus
potentially lethal localized PCa and deliver on the promise of precision cancer medicine. Toward that end, the
specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Dissect the interacting germline and somatic properties that mediate
localized PCa using biologically guided neural networks; 2) Determine the convergent spatial histopathologic
properties of molecularly and clinically distinct forms of PCa; 3) Develop and validate a clinical grade
molecular prognostic model guided by biological networks in real-world and clinical trial settings. For these
aims, we will build on our team’s extensive expertise in PCa genomics, computer science, and medical and
urologic oncology. Critically, we will embed our approaches in the context of harmonized and representative
PCa cohorts. The ability to understand why some intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancers are
phenotypically aggressive, and therefore predict which PCa will progress following curative-intent treatment
in this manner, would significantly advance basic PCa research and clinical translation. Broadly, this project
will strive to transform precision cancer medicine for prostate cancer and serve as a model for the creation,
development, and application of these emerging methodologies across cancer types and contexts."

Administrative Core. The overall goal of this Program Project is to elucidate the biological mechanisms of
ectopic calcification and its roles in the onset and etiology of diseases of aging, with particular focus on age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The major components of ectopic
calcifications are proteins, lipids and mineralized calcium phosphate, especially hydroxyapatite (HAP) and
whitlockite (WHT), but the roles of these components in the calcification process and disease progression are
not known. Four Projects and one technical Core will collaborate to gain a comprehensive mechanistic view of
ectopic calcification in age-related pathologies. Achieving this goal requires an integrated multidisciplinary
approach that combines multi-scale structural biology, biochemistry, cell biology and animal physiology, guided
by experts in these specific areas. The principal role of the Administrative Core is to ensure the success of the
Program as an integrated multidisciplinary and multi-scale investigative effort, and generate a comprehensive
view of calcification in diseases of aging that could not achieved by individual laboratories working alone. This
is essential for gaining comprehensive biomedical insights. To support this goal, the Core will facilitate
interactions among the investigators and provide a strong administrative structure."
10878726,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Molecular structure and function. The ectopic accumulation of mineralized calcium-phosphate deposits in
the eye and brain is a hallmark of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In
addition to inorganic components, such as hydroxyapatite (HAP), these deposits also contain lipids and
proteins of both blood and intracellular origin. The process of calcification is poorly understood, and it remains
unclear why some deposits progress to the disease state while others do not. It is also not clear if the
associated proteins are involved in the mineralization process, or if they deposit and accumulate on the already
pre-formed hydroxyapatite surface. Here, we address these important questions by comprehensive and
systematic investigation of the chemical, physical and structural properties of the molecular components
associated with calcified deposits, with particular focus on three validated constituents: the proteins vitronectin
(Vn), amyloid-b (Ab) and Tau. Vn is a blood glycoprotein with diverse functions in hemostasis, cell adhesion
and migration, innate immunity, tissue and bone remodeling. Recent studies have indicated that Vn binds both
soluble Ca2+ and solid HAP with chemical specificity and the T400M Vn variant is a major risk factor for AMD.
Ab and Tau are well known components of amyloid plaques in AD, but they are also found in calcification
deposits in the eye and the brain. First, we will investigate the role of these proteins in the calcification process
through fluorescence-based experiments and binding studies. Then, we will reconstitute proto-aggregates of
HAP, lipids and proteins to model pathological deposit formation in vitro. These aggregates will provide a
platform for assaying the functional roles of proteins and lipids in calcification and will aid the discovery of small
molecule and biomolecular inhibitors of calcification. And finally, we will use solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of Vn, Tau and Ab within calcified deposits and to
describe the protein-mineral interactions that drive their assembly. This information will be essential for
understanding the molecular mechanism of calcification and, ultimately, for the development of new diagnostic
and therapeutic agents."

The mission of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is to train
physician-scientists who will become leaders in biomedical research to understand, detect, treat, and prevent
human disease. To accomplish this mission, we have three goals, 1) to recruit a diverse group of students with
outstanding potential to become research-active physician-scientists, 2) to provide training in an inclusive,
safe, and stimulating learning environment where students can acquire the foundational knowledge and the
technical, operational, and professional skills necessary to pursue a career as a research-active physician-
scientist and a leader in academic medicine and/or biomedical research, and 3) to support/facilitate their
professional development to transition to the next stage in the training continuum. Through a holistic
admissions process, we seek to identify individuals with the intelligence, curiosity, creativity, resilience,
perseverence, and enthusiam for science that is essential for a successful research career. We guide the
students through a program tailored to meet their individual needs and interests. The program provides
rigorous, integrated medical and research training through a flexible, continously evolving curriculum that
includes 1) specialized MSTP courses, and 2) integration of graduate and medical school curriculum in the first
2 years and throughout the program. The training program has 3 phases. In the first 2 years students take a
combination of medical, graduate, and MSTP-specific courses to gain the didactic foundation for their reseach
and clinical training. Research rotations and guidance from program leadership assist them in thesis lab
selection. In the program’s 2nd phase, students perform independent, original research under their mentor’s
guidance. They publish their discoveries in high quality, peer-reviewed papers, and prepare and defend a PhD
thesis. Participation in a PhD phase MSTP-run, outpatient clinic builds clinical skills. In the final phase, they
complete their clinical training. A multifaceted approach trains students to perform rigorous and reproducible
research in a responsible, ethical manner. Currently, the program has 113 trainees, 41% woman, 28% from
groups underrepresented in medicine (twice percentage in the applicant pool), and 11% with disabilities. We
will expand to ~120-130 trainees by increasing the entering class size to 16. Since its inception in 1964, as one
of the first three NIH-funded MSTPs, 484 trainees have graduated. 413 have completed postgraduate training
and published over 19,000 papers, an average of ~47 papers/graduate. 74% have jobs at academic medical
centers, research institutes, NIH or pharmaceutical companies. By various measures, the graduates have
achieved outstanding success and advanced biomedical research and academic medicine. We propose to
further integrate graduate and medical training, and increase opportunities for involvement in clinical and
translational research to prepare a future generation of physician-scientists who will be at the leading edge of
biomedical research with the ultimate goal of improving human health and reducing the burden of disease."

Candidate: Dr. Hast received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with a focus on thermodynamics
and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering with a focus on computational biomechanics. His long-term goal is to
become an independent researcher focused on improving patient outcomes following fragility fractures. This
proposal uses an interdisciplinary research framework using a small animal model to identify mechanisms that
govern fracture healing in healthy and diseased bone. The objective of this proposal is to have Dr. Hast acquire
the training necessary in small animal models, cellular assays, and molecular laboratory techniques to fully
define the mechanisms that govern callus formation and bone remodeling in the milieu of osteoporosis. This will
equip him with the tools necessary to become a thought leader in the field of fragility fracture repair.
Mentoring Committee and Training Plan: Dr. Mauck will serve as primary mentor and provide structured
mentoring in tissue engineering, laboratory techniques, and provide career development training. Drs. Boerckel
and Qin will serve as co-mentors and provide hands-on training in small animal surgeries, histology,
immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling. Dr. Hast will also have advisory committees (technical: Drs. Liu,
Ahn, Mehta, Manogharan; career: Drs. Soslowsky, Arbogast, Elliott) to guide his development. Dr. Hast will
participate regularly in faculty meetings, seminars, workshops, and coursework to make him a complete and
independent researcher. He will present his research at national conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania is home to the McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory and Penn
Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD), a 22,00 ft2 research space that is well-equipped for the proposed
training and research plan. The PCMD and hosts several NIH supported core services focused on
musculoskeletal research, which include histology, biomechanics, and imaging. Both the PCMD and Penn host
weekly/monthly seminars in cellular and molecular biology, medical imaging, bioengineering, and professional
development.
Research: This proposed work will challenge the current clinical paradigms that use metal implants to heal
fractures. The central hypothesis is that properly timed gradual (gradient-based) increases in loading will lead to
improved repair of simulated fractures. To test this novel hypothesis, a rat model will be used in 2 aims. Aim 1
will establish the effects of gradual introduction of mechanotransduction on fracture repair in healthy bone. Aim
2 will determine what changes in mechanotransduction are required to improve fracture repair in compromised
bone. Testing these aims will generate critical preliminary data for a follow-up R01 that includes a larger animal
model, along with pharmacological interventions that may accelerate and improve repair.
Institutional Commitment to Candidate: Dr. Hast is an Assistant Research Professor and has been provided
start-up funds, laboratory space, and research personnel needed to perform the proposed work."
10852012,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Characterization of the metabolic interactions between organisms is key to understanding the mechanisms of
disease and symbioses between microbes and their animal hosts. Our long-term goal is to advance the
applicability and accessibility of proteomic stable isotope probing (SIP) in ways that make it a valuable tool for
microbiome researchers looking to measure in situ metabolic interactions of human microbiota. The objective
of this proposal is to improve the performance and reproducibility of experimental measurements and
accelerate the computational analysis of proteomic SIP experiments and to demonstrate the value of this
method for studying the in vivo and in vitro metabolism of prebiotics by gut microbiota. Expected outcomes will
represent a significant advance, because optimizing the use of prebiotics as therapeutics requires identification
of the specific microorganisms capable of metabolizing prebiotics. By identifying proteins of specific taxa that
are synthesized as a direct result of prebiotic assimilation, proteomic SIP will provide unambiguous links
between prebiotic metabolism and the specific microorganisms responsible for this activity. We will accomplish
this objective by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to increase the performance and reproducibility of mass
spectrometry measurements by optimizing data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for proteomic SIP; 2)
to significantly accelerate the computing-intensive database search step by adapting the Sipros algorithm to
use graphic processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing; and 3) to track in vivo and in vitro prebiotic
assimilation patterns by microbial populations within simple consortia and complex natural communities. Our
proposed work includes several innovations, such as the application of deep learning algorithms to improve the
analysis mass spectrometry data, leveraging GPU-based parallel computing and cloud computing to
accelerate the computational steps in the data analysis workflow, and using proteomic SIP for the first time to
track prebiotic metabolism by gut microbes. The expected outcomes of the project include (a) a new DIA-
based workflow for proteomic SIP that can identify significantly more labeled peptides at higher accuracy of
enrichment estimation, (b) a new computational workflow that is faster to run, more scalable to large datasets,
and more accessible to researchers, and (c) establish novel foundational knowledge on the specificity of
prebiotic metabolism by microbes in the gut. These outcomes will establish proteomic SIP as a valuable -omics
tool that will complement existing approaches to study the metabolism of gut microbiota, and specifically
highlight its ability to investigate metabolism of prebiotics and probiotics as they relate to treating microbial
dysbiosis and nutrition-related diseases."
10883568,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 3: Autophagy
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer with few effective therapies.
The poor performance of current treatments is partly due to metabolic adaptations in both the tumor and stromal
compartments, such as the recycling of proteins and organelles through increased autophagy. As a hallmark of
PDA, autophagy provides a key source of nutrients in the restrictive tumor microenvironment (TME).
Accumulating evidence also implicates the autophagy program as a critical mediator of resistance to numerous
therapeutics, including chemotherapy, MEK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibition. Foundational research
from the Shaw group decoded key biochemical steps involved in the initiation of autophagy, including upstream
regulation of AMPK and its downstream activation of ULK1 and ULK2, the kinases that drive autophagosome
formation. More recent work from the Shaw group has also revealed that AMPK can block the translocation of
Class II HDACs to the nucleus. Despites these advances, the specific roles of AMPK in autophagy control and
epigenetic regulation have never been investigated in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, while autophagy has
emerged as an attractive therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, efforts to translate this to the clinic have been
hindered by a lack of autophagy-specific inhibitors, with only broad lysosomotropic agents like chloroquine
available for study. To address this gap, the lab has developed novel, bioavailable inhibitors of ULK1 and ULK2,
two of only three druggable enzymes specific to the autophagy pathway. These inhibitors provide critical tools
with which to dissect the contributions of autophagy to PDA growth and form the basis for a new approach for
overcoming therapeutic resistance in this deadly disease. Here, experiments proposed in Aim 1 will define when
and where different facets of AMPK signaling and autophagy are activated during disease progression in the
autochthonous mouse KPC model of PDA. In collaboration with Project 1, conditional deletions of AMPK or its
downstream targets ULK1/2 and HDAC3 will be used to evaluate their contribution to metabolic adaptations
driving tumor growth and epigenetic changes mediating tumor cellular functions. In addition, the contribution of
AMPK pathway components in supporting PDA resistance to chemotherapeutics and targeted therapies will be
dissected. In Aim 2, the roles of canonical and noncanonical autophagy in non-cell autonomous support of
pancreatic tumor growth will be delineated by comparing stromal deletion of ULK1/2 and ATG7. In addition,
experiments will dissect cell-specific requirements for autophagy within the fibroblast and myeloid compartments
in supporting PDA therapeutic resistance. In Aim 3, the Shaw lab’s novel, bioavailable ULK inhibitor will be used
to determine how selective inhibition of autophagy impacts PDA growth through reprogrammed tumor and
stromal cell function. The potential of ULK inhibitors in rescuing autophagy-dependent therapeutic resistance to
chemotherapies, MEK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibition will be explored."

The overall goal of the Administrative and Biostatistics Core (Admin Core) is to facilitate research efforts toward
understanding intrinsic resistance to therapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). This will be
accomplished by providing the three Research Projects (Projects) and the three Shared Resource Cores (Cores)
with organizational support, professional project management, biostatistical expertise, data storage and sharing
solutions, and a governance framework. The Admin Core will plan and coordinate meetings between the
scientific teams, as well as between the scientific teams and the leadership groups. The Admin Core will include
a Project Manager, who will provide professional project management services to ensure that stated objectives
are successfully achieved. As part of this effort, the Project Manager will monitor Core activities to ensure that
efforts of these cutting-edge scientific resources are integrated and coordinated, and that the Cores are operating
effectively and efficiently to meet the needs of the Projects. The Project Manager will also establish a governance
framework for resolving potential conflicts between team members and for managing resource utilization and
budgetary concerns. The Admin Core will include a Biostatistics Unit that will be intimately involved in all
experimental design and data analysis. The Biostatistics Unit will be responsible for ensuring that all experiments
are sufficiently powered, and that the resulting data are analyzed using the most scientifically rigorous
approaches. Novel methods will be developed when needed. One faculty-level statistician will split their effort
between the Biostatics Unit and the bioinformatics team within the Tumor and Microenvironment
Heterogeneity Core, coordinating communication and the transfer of data between these data analytic groups.
Finally, the Admin Core will include a Data Curator who will help establish and oversee a centralized data-storage
system into which all data generated by the scientific teams will be deposited and properly annotated. This

10883575,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core 1: Tumor and Microenvironment Heterogeneity Core
The central hypothesis driving efforts of the TMH Core is that immune and other stromal cells in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) contribute to both inherent and acquired therapeutic resistance in PDA. Such cells vary
phenotypically, functionally, metabolically, and spatially within the TME, creating distinct niches. For example,
functionally specialized immune cells (e.g., macrophages, T cells, neutrophils) are common within the TME and
can promote or suppress tumor growth. Likewise, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to extracellular
matrix formation, tumor invasion/metastasis, and T cell exclusion, and can be subdivided into myofibroblastic
CAFs (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) that differentially affect tumor growth and therapeutic
resistance. Thus, characterizing cellular and functional heterogeneity and TME localization, and understanding
how they contribute to therapeutic resistance is key to developing effective therapies. Utilizing expertise in single
cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, functional assays, and digital spatial profiling (DSP), the Core will interrogate
how cellular diversity and localization contribute to therapeutic resistance in PDA.
The TMH Core will support the individual Projects in their efforts to interrogate the TME and tumor-TME
crosstalk with state-of-art approaches and by providing expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, and immunology.
The TMH Core will provide services that are unavailable in existing Salk Institute Cores, and therefore fulfill an
unmet need. In Aim 1, the TMH Core will map the spatial heterogeneity of tumor and stromal cells in human
PDA via DSP (NanoString) to correlate phenotypes with specific tumor niches. In Aim 2, the Core will functionally
characterize immune cells and inflammatory cytokines in the TME via flow cytometry and use Isoplexis IsoSpark
for single cell-secretome analysis and multiplex cytokine assays. In Aim 3, the Core will provide an integrated
platform of single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing to define the functional heterogeneity of tumor and stromal
cells in PDA and to understand how this heterogeneity contributes to and/or is affected by therapeutic responses.
These aims will support the goals of the projects to elucidate mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in PDA
through epigenetic changes (Project 1), extracellular signaling (Project 2), and AMPK driven autophagy
(Project 3). The TMH Core will collaborate with the Mouse Models Core and the Human Specimen and
Organoid Core to design novel experiments and incorporate mouse and human organoid datasets to decipher
the role of stromal and tumor cells in PDA resistance to therapy. Moreover, the TMH Core will work closely with
the Biostatistics Unit within the Administrative and Biostatistics Core to ensure rigorous state-of-the-art
preprocessing and analysis pipelines. In combination with the efforts of the Projects and other Cores, the TMH
Core will not only elucidate the roles of tumor and stromal cells in therapeutic resistance in PDA, but also provide
insight into how stromal cells are co-opted and coordinated by the tumor. These studies will inform the treatment
of PDA by identifying which compartments can be therapeutically rewired to enhance therapeutic efficacy."
10850948,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In alcohol use disorder (AUD), alcohol consumption is driven, in part, by negative reinforcement: the removal of
the negative affective state. This negative reinforcement is governed, in part, by the dynorphin/kappa opioid
receptor (KOR) system and involves the monoamines, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA). Across multiple
brain regions, activation of KORs has been found to elicit a state of aversion, and this is also the case for the
nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, in the caudal subregion. Paradoxically, however, KOR activation in the rostral
NAc shell has been found to be rewarding. Our preliminary data, using a model of ethanol drinking that reflects
the transition to dependence, show that KOR activation in the rostral NAc shell promotes approach behavior and
attenuates ethanol drinking, while activation in the caudal shell instead promotes avoidance behavior and ethanol
drinking. Moreover, while DA and 5-HT afferents terminate in both the rostral and caudal shell, KORs have far
greater inhibitory effects on DA release in the caudal shell. We hypothesize that activation of KORs in the rostral
NAc shell elicits a hedonic state and inhibits ethanol drinking, by preferentially modulating 5-HT vs. DA; in
contrast, KOR activation in the caudal NAc shell drives a dysphoric state and increases ethanol drinking, by
preferentially modulating DA vs. 5-HT. Aim 1 investigates the specific hypothesis that KOR activation in the
rostral shell reduces ethanol drinking and induces positive affect, with the balance of KOR control over
monoamine release tipped towards 5-HT. To accomplish this, the proposed experiments, in the rostral NAc shell,
will use pharmacology to determine effects of KOR activation on (1) ethanol drinking and (2) approach/avoidance
behavior, molecular biology to (3) examine the distribution of KORs on DA and 5-HT terminals, and
electrochemical techniques to measure effects of KOR activation on optically stimulated (4) DA and (5) 5-HT.
Aim 2 investigates the specific hypothesis that KOR activation in the caudal shell potentiates ethanol drinking
and negative affect, with KORs having their major effects on DA. To accomplish this, the proposed experiments,
in the caudal NAc shell, will determine effects of KOR activation on (1) ethanol drinking and (2)
approach/avoidance behavior, (3) examine the distribution of KORs on DA and 5-HT terminals, and measure
effects of KOR activation on optically stimulated (4) DA and (5) 5-HT. Aim 3 clarifies the mechanism driving
these paradoxical effects on behavior. It investigates the specific hypothesis that KOR-mediated inhibition of 5-
HT activity in the NAc shell inhibits ethanol consumption, while inhibition of DA activity does the opposite, and
that these effects of 5-HT and DA inhibition are most apparent in the rostral and caudal shell, respectively. Thus,
the proposed experiments will examine behavioral effects of viral KOR expression selectively on (1) DA and (2)
5-HT terminals in the rostral and caudal shell, and chemogenetic inhibition of (3) DA and (4) 5-HT projections to
these subregions. Understanding the diverse functions of the KOR system could ultimately facilitate the design
of pathway-specific therapeutics, revolutionizing treatment for AUD."
10843812,"The intestine is emerging as a regulatory and signaling organ, enabling diet-derived nutrients to perform
essential actions. A better understanding of intestinal regulation of systemic lipid metabolism has direct
implications to multiple human metabolic pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, fatty liver, and insulin
resistance. The delta-9 desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), converts saturated fatty acids to
monounsaturated products and has been shown to regulate lipid esterification in liver and skin. However,
virtually nothing is known about the role of SCD1 in the intestine, where lipid esterification is crucial for its
eventual absorption and secretion into chylomicrons (CMs). To address this gap in knowledge, we generated
mice with a targeted deletion of SCD1 only in intestinal epithelial cells (iKO mice). Remarkably, we find that
iKO animals have significant reductions not only in intestinal lipids, but also in circulating and hepatic lipid
levels, particularly in levels of monounsaturated fatty acids. iKO mice also have significant increases in both
energy expenditure and glucose tolerance, accompanied by increased thermogenic markers in brown adipose
tissue and increased plasma GLP-1 levels. Unexpectedly, intestinal SCD1 deletion elevates plasma and
hepatic bile acids (BAs) and alters markers of hepatobiliary BA efflux and ileal BA reuptake. Supported by
these and other compelling preliminary data, this application will assess the role of intestinal SCD1 in
integrating metabolic signals originating in the gut. The central hypothesis of this application is that intestinal
SCD1 regulates metabolic health by altering secreted lipid content and composition, TGR5 signaling in BAT
and the gut, and enterohepatic BA metabolism. This hypothesis will be tested by our two related but
independent Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the relevance of intestinal SCD1 inhibition to energy balance
in the context of hypercaloric and hyperlipidemic diets. We will also evaluate a mechanistic role for TGR5 in
mediating the improved metabolic phenotypes of iKO mice. In Aim 2, we will evaluate a role for SCD1-derived
MUFAs in regulating hepatic BA efflux and intestinal BA reuptake . We will also utilize a) an inhibitor of
intestinal BA reuptake, b) a gut-restricted FXR agonist, and c) dietary MUFAs to restore hepatic and plasma
BA levels in iKO mice."

In the setting of the burgeoning obesity epidemic, metabolic health involving diabetes, diabetes-related risk
factors and diabetes-related complications increasingly burden the US health care system. Yet, even as the
disease burden increases, the number of investigators committed to finding ways to prevent and treat
metabolic diseases has lagged persistently behind. The University of Minnesota (UMN) has held a T32 training
grant since 1977 with demonstrated success. Within the last 10 years (n=13 trainees), 10 (77%) are in
research related fields, 5 (38.4%) are Assistant Professors, and 7 (54%) are associated with NIH grants (either
PI or Co-I). To drive the success of the T32 training program moving forward, we have assembled an
outstanding, complementary leadership team (MPI between Drs Chow and Bernlohr) and sharpened the
current proposal’s focus to leverage the recent flourishing success of UMN investigators in metabolic
healthspan, the preservation of metabolic health. The proposed T32 program will provide advanced training in
state-of-the-art research focused on the mechanisms affecting metabolic healthspan and enhancing metabolic
health. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multifaceted approach inspired by our past history to train four
postdoctoral students (MD, PhD or MD/PhD) per year for up to 2 years per trainee. The training approach
includes the following: #1 Provide trainees with the skill sets necessary to perform multidisciplinary research
regarding metabolic healthspan, #2 Provide high quality mentorship, now involving Senior/Associate Mentors
(mentor dyads) to support trainee and Associate Mentor development, #3 Provide an outstanding environment
fusing research and clinical training for physician and PhD trainees, #4 Provide skill development, including the
experience of writing a F32 or alternative career development grant during the second year, for trainees to
thrive in academic medicine and #5 Establish programs that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse
trainees. The overarching objective of the proposed UMN T32 program is to train physicians and scientists for
research careers focused on enhancing metabolic healthspan while providing a thoughtfully-designed training
environment focused on meeting the unique development needs of postdoctoral fellows as they define their
career and research goals."

This is a competitive renewal application for an Alcohol Training Program in Neurosciences at the University of
New Mexico (UNM-ARTN). This program is currently ending Year 19 of support, and has increased visibility of
alcohol research across campus. Since 2003, the UNM-ARTN grant has supported 30 trainees, 10 in the past 5
years. Over the past 5 years, we have filled all our training slots and trainees have been well distributed among
the training faculty. The objective of the UNM-ARTN is to support the training of young researchers and provide
them with in-depth knowledge of different areas of alcohol research and multiple technical approaches to tackle
important questions in this field. UNM-ARTN program provides training in molecular biological, biochemical,
electrophysiologic, imaging, and behavioral approaches to 4 Ph.D. students per year, and at this point, 93% of
former trainees have obtained their Ph.D. degrees. The Training Faculty has strengths in three areas of fetal
alcohol spectrum disorder research: 1. Basic mechanisms involved in ethanol neuro-teratogenesis; 2.
Biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure; and 3. Therapeutic interventions to ameliorate FASD-related cognitive
deficits. New initiatives including a Trainee Orientation Program, an expanded UNM-ARTN Research Seminar
and increased collaboration across training program at UNM will promote skills development and successful
transitions into competitive postdoctoral fellowships and careers in the biomedical research workforce. A total of
15 faculty members (9 men and 6 women) from the Departments of Neurosciences, , Pharmaceutical Sciences
and Psychology will serve as Core Faculty. All are funded via R00, R01 or P50 mechanisms, are highly
productive; have a track record of successful research mentoring or strong mentor training; and have extensive
collaborative interactions in terms of research grants, publications, and mentoring of graduate students.
Predoctoral trainees will be drawn from the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program of the UNM Health Sciences
Center and the Cognition, Brain and Behavior Program of the UNM Psychology Department. The program will
continue to support 4 Ph.D. students per year, typically for a 2-3-year period. The program will be overseen by
Drs. Brigman and Clark, who will ensure trainees are well supported in both the BSGP and CBB programs, a
Steering Committee composed of selected members of the Training Faculty and a student representative, and
Internal and External Advisory Committees. Our diverse trainees have been very successful in presenting at
scientific meetings, and publishing in peer-reviewed journals. To date, they have obtained 12 predoctoral
fellowships/minority supplements, and 1 more is pending review. Most of our former trainees have gone on to
pursue careers in biomedical research or postdoctoral training at research-intensive programs Our goal is to
continue to provide promising graduate students with the necessary high-quality training to prepare them for a

The last decade has seen an exponential increase in multimodal cancer -omics data due to the development of
high throughput cutting-edge technologies that capture DNA, RNA, protein and metabolite level data. There is a
critical need for training the next generation of data scientists in genomics who can be tasked to translate the
complex integration of these high dimensional data to deliver precision oncology using sophisticated statistical
and computational methods and tools. Due to growing enticements from industry, there is significant threat of
“brain drain” from academia that is especially prevalent among those with data science and high dimensional
computational skills. This proposal seeks to develop the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Genomics
Research Experience for Master’s Students (GEMS) Fellowship Program, a structured and specialized program
that targets master’s level trainees in biostatistics, statistics, data science, computer science or related
quantitative discipline (6 per summer over 5 years). The GEMS program is a hands-on, 12-week immersive and
interdisciplinary summer research experience in cancer genomics with several components that make the
program unique: access to the world's leading resources of cancer genomics data and tools, a quantitative and
scientific dual-mentoring model, pairing with a peer advisor, and a lecture/mini workshop series on cutting-edge
genomic technologies and high dimensional data analysis given by program faculty who are world experts. The
fellows will gain experience working with whole-genome and whole-transcriptome next-generation sequencing
data and obtain a real understanding of high-dimensional data analysis, advanced statistical genomics concepts
and modeling techniques, parallel computing and reproducible research paradigms. This combination of large
data resources, computational infrastructure, didactic lecture and hands-on workshop series from program
faculty creates a unique environment in which the following aims will be pursued: 1) develop a genomics
research internship program that annually recruits 6 students to provide them a 12-week immersive hands-on
research training experience addressing cutting edge cancer genomics research questions; 2) develop and
facilitate a bi-directional evaluation plan to provide timely assessment and feedback for the participants and their
mentors; and 3) track participants' career development over time to evaluate the success of the program and to
support program alumni to pursue quantitative careers in genomics. GEMS will be co-led by 2 PDs at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with long track records of impactful research, mentorship, and successful
knowledge translation. The dual team mentoring approach will prepare students for the inter-disciplinary
translational science workforce and will learn to become critical thinkers. GEMS will prepare trainees for impactful
careers as -omics data scientists and will obtain work-force training in genomics cancer medicine."
10630302,"Abstract
In the first years of life, when the brain is rapidly developing, children are disproportionately exposed to
xenobiotics, including phthalates. However, the immaturity of the blood brain barrier cerebrovasculature and
xenobiotic metabolism and excretion pathways render the infant brain more vulnerable to toxic compounds.
Despite growing evidence of associations of prenatal phthalate exposures with diverse aspects of
neurobehavioral development, few studies have assessed the role of early life exposure to phthalates on
neurodevelopment. Furthermore, the findings on prenatal exposure have been paradoxical, suggesting that
phthalate exposure accelerates the maturity of functional networks in infancy but is maladaptive in later life. Our
objective is to examine the extent to which phthalate exposures change structural and functional brain
development at a critical window of vulnerability (from birth to age 5), and to reconcile the paradoxical findings
by tracking a variety of social, behavioral and developmental outcomes through longitudinal evaluation. We
propose to leverage the University of North Carolina Baby Connectome Project (BCP), the goal of which is to
map normative brain development in early life using serial structural (sMRI) and resting-state functional (rsfMRI)
magnetic resonance imaging paired with age-appropriate developmental assessments. In a pilot study, we found
that higher early life exposure to monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) is associated with larger cortical gray matter
volumes in regions of the frontal cortex that direct language processing and executive function, as well as
dysregulated functional connectivity in the primary visual, default mode, and sensorimotor networks. While this
pilot established a strong scientific premise for further study, it had a limited sample size and only measured a
subset of relevant phthalates. To provide a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of the phthalate and
exposomic landscape in early life, we propose to extend our analysis to 19 phthalates and phthalate
replacements and to evaluate the unbiased, untargeted exposome. For a more in-depth developmental
perspective, we also propose to examine the longitudinal relationship between early life toxicant exposures and
sMRI, rsfMRIs and developmental inventories. We plan to increase enrollment by 50 children, resulting in a final
sample size of approximately 250 children contributing approximately 540 scans. Our group has pioneered the
quantitative characterization of spatiotemporal brain development in early infancy and includes a unique
assemblage of expertise in environmental epidemiology, infant brain imaging, early brain development,
toxicology, biostatistics, and child psychiatry that will ensure successful completion of this work. This study has
important public health significance because phthalate exposures are ubiquitous, largely unregulated in the US,
and more extensive and impactful to infants than to adults. Imaging biomarkers will provide crucial information
on the mechanism of phthalate neurotoxicity that will guide regulatory action to protect children from maladaptive
developmental outcomes."

Impulsivity has gained prominence as one of the cardinal etiological risk factors for the development and
maintenance of addictive disorders. However, both impulsivity and addiction are highly heterogeneous, which
has hampered progress in understanding the link between the two. To address this heterogeneity, we have
developed a program of addiction research in Bulgaria, a major European center for production of synthetic
amphetamine-type stimulants and a key transit country for heroin trafficking, due to its strategic geographical
position on the Balkan Drug Route. Through our 17-yearlong collaboration with Bulgarian colleagues, we have
accessed rare populations of predominantly monosubstance-dependent (‘pure’) heroin and amphetamine users,
many in protracted abstinence. In the parent DA021421 study, we have tested >800 participants with a
comprehensive assessment battery of clinical, personality, and neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity and related
externalizing and internalizing phenotypes. We genotyped participants with the Smokescreen array and enrolled
siblings discordant for opiate and stimulant addictions. We combined theory-driven (e.g. cognitive modeling, joint
modeling) with data-driven (e.g. machine learning (ML)) computational approaches, which proved particularly
informative and revealed distinct multivariate risk profiles characterizing opiate and stimulant addictions with high
degree of accuracy. Findings from the parent study significantly informed our integrative multidisciplinary
framework (Vassileva & Conrod, 2019), which highlights the potential for distinct dimensions of impulsivity to
inform clinical assessment and intervention development for different types of addictions. Impulsivity also figures
prominently in the neuroscience-based heuristic framework for the neuroclinical assessment of addictions (ANA;
Kwako et al., 2016), which proposes that successful addiction treatment must accommodate the heterogeneity
and different etiological mechanisms implicated in addictions, by performing multidimensional assessments
focusing on three neurofunctional domains of impulsivity and compulsivity: executive function (EF), incentive
salience (IS), and negative emotionality (NE). However, because the ANA framework is based primarily on
findings in alcohol use disorder, it is not well understood how these domains might generalize to other SUD,
such as opiate and stimulant use disorders. The current competing renewal application aims to address this
critical gap with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify key personality, neurobehavioral, polygenic, and
computational markers of opiate and stimulant addiction following the ANA framework, using the comprehensive
assessment battery and computational methods developed in the parent DA021421 with 250 participants (100
with opiate use disorder, 100 with stimulant use disorder, and 50 healthy controls); Aim 2: Identify the brain
signatures of the 3 ANA domains (EF, IS, NE) in opiate and stimulant addictions; Exploratory Aim 3: Combine
data from Aims 1 and 2 to identify addiction biotypes based on neurocircuitry implicated in the ANA domains."

10840803,"Summary:
One of the biggest gaps in our knowledge of the human gut microbiome is how microbes secure the energy
and nutrients required to sustain their growth. This is an important deficit in light of the fact that microbial
pathways produce short chain fatty acids like butyrate, indoles like indolepropionic acid, and amines like
trimethylamine, all of which play a critical role in host physiology and disease. Understanding the metabolic
processes that underlie why microbes make these molecules is critical for developing strategies to predictably
control the metabolic output of the gut microbiota.
Despite the importance of microbial metabolism in the gut to human physiology, we know very little about the
nature of these metabolic pathways. A key gap in knowledge is how pathways for high abundance metabolites
is linked to the physiology of commensal bacteria. Knowledge of these metabolic strategies is critical to
developing strategies aimed at predictably modulating the metabolic output of the gut microbiota. One of the
major challenges to studying the gut microbiota is that genetic tools are only available for a small subset of
bacteria. Therefore, new tools are urgently needed to study the physiology and metabolism of genetically
intractable microbes.
In this project, we will use techniques in bacterial physiology and genetics to uncover how microbes in the gut
capture energy from dietary nutrients, and how these processes contribute to drug-like small molecules that
influence host physiology. We will also develop a new metabolomics approach to generate genome-wide maps
of genetic determinants of microbial small molecules in genetically tractable and intractable gut bacteria. These
studies will provide fundamental insights into several of the microbiome's core functions and will stimulate
future avenues for inquiry into the human gut microbiome."
10873730,"Emerging lines of evidence suggest an intimate crosstalk among energy metabolism, metabolites and
epigenetics. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones (histone “marks”) (e.g., lysine acetylation
(Kac) and methylation (Kme)) are known to be regulated by metabolism, contributing to the epigenetic
programs that are associated with cellular physiology and disease. However, we do not yet know if additional
histone PTM pathways exist and if they can be modulated by diverse cellular metabolites. Thus, chemistry and
biochemistry of metabolites-mediated chromatin changes remain poorly characterized. Lactate, a widely known
cellular metabolite, can be dramatically induced under some cellular conditions (e.g. hypoxia) and in the
Warburg effect, an observation most commonly shared among diverse cancers and associated with many
diseases. Lactate concentration can rise to 20-40 mM in cancer tissues. Although this compound was
discovered ~200 years ago, its non-metabolic functions in physiology (e.g., hypoxia, stem cell differentiation
and immunoresponse) and disease (e.g., cancer and diabetes) remain unknown, representing a long-standing
question in biology. We recently discovered a lactate-derived, new lysine modification, lysine lactylation (Kla).
We comprehensively validated this PTM by chemical and biochemical approaches. This PTM can be
stimulated by the Warburg effect-derived lactate and has different temporal dynamics from the widely studied
lysine acetylation (Kac). Our epigenetic studies suggest that histone Kla represents a new type of metabolism-
regulated epigenetic changes and contributes to gene regulation. We hypothesize that the histone Kla pathway
is molecularly distinct from Kac pathway and contribute to gene regulation. We therefore propose to
characterize the Kla pathway by defining its key regulatory elements: enzymes that can remove the
modification (or delactylases), and their targets on histones and non-histone substrate proteins. We will also
study their role in epigenetic regulation in cyclic behavior of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in which lactate and
its regulatory enzyme play a key role. We will use an integrated strategy involving chemical biology,
enzymology, quantitative proteomics, and biochemistry approaches. The knowledge gained from this study will
likely have a broad impact on our understanding of epigenetics, and will lay a foundation for studying Kla and
the Warburg effect."
10857136,"Project Summary / Abstract:
 This MIRA proposal merges two distinct projects supported by R01GM128142, “The role of membrane
curvature in surface nanotopography-induced cell functions”, and R01GM125737, “Developing nanoscale
electrophysiology sensors for robust intracellular recording”. While the two projects focus on different biological
questions, the unifying theme is to develop nanoscale probes to elucidate the cellular machinery in the intricate
environment of living cells. In this proposal, we discuss topics along the lines of the parent grants, focusing on
the significance of the biological problems, our recent and evolving results, and directions for the future. For
the first project, the long-term goal is to understand how membrane curvature regulates biochemical signals
that are transmitted through the cell-matrix interface. At the cell-matrix interface, where the cells make physical
contact with extracellular matrices, the membrane may be locally deformed by matrix topography or
mechanical forces. As it remains a challenge to manipulate nanoscale membrane curvature in live cells, our
current understanding of how local membrane curvature affects signal transmission is limited. We propose to
use nanotechnology-based precision engineering to control interface membrane curvature in live cells. We
seek to understand how cellular processes are affected by membrane curvature and the underlying molecular
mechanisms. The knowledge gained will help us understanding how cells interact with extracellular matrix and
also help us designing biomaterials for better integration with cells. For the second project, we are developing
vertical nanoelectrodes into a robust and easy-to-use electrophysiology tool that can reliably achieve parallel
intracellular recording of cardiomyocytes with minimal perturbation. Simultaneous nanoelectrode and patch
clamp recordings on same cells confirmed that nanoelectrodes accurately record action potential waveforms
for classification and characterization of stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes. These nanoelectrodes will enable
us to understand how in vitro interventions accelerate the maturation of stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte.
Furthermore, nanoelectrodes provide an ideal tool for monitoring the generation and resealing of membrane
pores on cardiomyocytes that are prone to membrane rupture due to their large size and strong mechanical
contraction. We will use nanoelectrode to investigate how proteins participate in the membrane resealing
process. We hope to achieve a broad impact by combining the development of new tools with applications to
specific biological systems."

Immune cells interpret chemical cues in their environment and make decisions that control their fate. For
example, human neutrophils often respond to signals by polarizing and migrating toward the chemical source.
Critical for these cellular functions is the dynamic interplay between cell surface receptors, small GTPases, and
the enzymes that synthesize phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids. This study aims to decipher the
mechanisms the control communication between these different classes of signaling molecules at the plasma
membrane. Using human neutrophils, we find that Cdc42 GTPase and a lipid phosphatase denoted SHIP1
trigger a molecular signal that propagates across the plasma membrane in the form of a traveling wave. This
behavior, coined excitability, involves repetitive cycles of protein recruitment ON and OFF the membrane. The
goal of this study is to determine how SHIP1 regulates the excitable signaling network by integrating signals
derived from lipids and membrane tethered proteins. Using a variety of in vitro biochemistry techniques, including
supported membrane technology and single molecule imaging, we will determine how lipid composition controls
SHIP1 membrane association and phosphatase activity (Aim 1). Using factors that regulate the excitable
signaling network in cells, we will reconstitute mechanisms that control SHIP1 membrane recruitment, release
of autoinhibition, and activation (Aim 2). In parallel, we will use CRISPR based genome editing, optogenetics,
and quantitative live cell imaging of fluorescent biosensors to elucidate how communication between PIP lipids
and small GTPase is regulated by SHIP1. Using these tools we will determine the role SHIP1 serves as signaling
network scaffold versus a lipid phosphatase (Aim 3). Overall, this study will unify membrane biophysics and cell
biology to explain how PIP lipids, small GTPases, and SHIP1 synergistically control the excitable signaling
network and cell migration in neutrophils. By unraveling how white blood cells sense, interpret, and respond to
pathogenic signals we will fill a gap in knowledge concerning how these signaling molecules coordinate cellular
movement with the underlying excitable network. This discovery could open doors for researchers to develop
new therapeutics that can be used to modulate immune cell functions in ways that combat infection,
inflammation, and cancer."
10843237,"The goal of the Institutional Career Development program (KL2) is to continue building a cohort of
independent, innovative CTR scientists at UNM HSC. In CTSC 1.0 & 2.0, we provided focused, effective
mentoring for scholars, who in turn were successful in conducting research, publishing, and obtaining
independent extramural funding. Their accomplishments propelled their careers and helped them attain
personal goals in CTR and academic leadership. All 14 KL2 scholars continue to conduct research and have
collectively garnered over $14M in NIH funding. By cultivating scholar careers, UNM HSC benefits enormously
through an expanded CTR faculty base. Our KL2—uniquely structured to recruit nationally for new scholars to
expand our research capacity—has mentored faculty scholars in eight UNM HSC departments, providing
broad institutional support. The long-term goal of KL2 is to build a legacy of highly skilled, successful
translational scientists with a team-science mindset to address the significant health problems of New Mexico,
the region, and nation. Our objective is to foster research abilities, writing skills, and funding success of junior
faculty scholars through dedicated mentorship and career development. By supporting and retaining
successful CTR scientists, KL2 demonstrates UNM CTSC’s importance in catalyzing CTR career development,
thereby strategically increasing CTR capacity for all UNM HSC departments. Our rationale is that, by building
on our already successful KL2, we will continue to develop the next generation of accomplished translational
scientists. CTSC 3.0 will meet our overarching goal through these specific aims: 1) Through the KL2
mechanism, expand the base of active and impactful CTR at UNM HSC; 2) Expand and evolve the CTR
mentoring environment at UNM HSC; 3) Employ personalized pathways to flexibly implement scholar career
development strategies; and 4) Implement a comprehensive evaluation process with formative and summative
components for assessment of KL2 scholars, mentors, and the KL2 program. Our expected outcome is
enhanced capacity to conduct CTR on the most important problems facing our state, region, and nation. Such
outcomes are expected to have an important, long-term positive impact on the UNM HSC CTR workforce,
creating a generation of highly trained CTR scientists who significantly accelerate the translation of discovery
into beneficial health impacts."
10880252,"ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need to develop a new type of scientist, one who is motivated by a need to bring scientific
advances to clinics and communities in an equitable fashion, and to make a long-term impact by contributing to
health policies and research that will promote health equity. This scientist is fluent in the language of team
science and collaboration and recognizes the principles that contribute to scientific translation across disciplines.
This scientist brings an inclusive mindset to how they form and lead their research teams as well as the methods
they use in their research. These characteristics describe a translational scientist. Transforming translational
researchers, historically trained in discipline- and disease-specific approaches, into translational scientists
requires a departure from traditional career development programs. To address this need, the proposed new
CTSA K12 program, the Gene Orringer Advancing Translational Science Career Development Award at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), will support nine early-career Scholars with at least 75%
protected time for research and career development activities for up to 3 years. The objectives of the CTSA K12
are to: 1) Recruit junior faculty who are dedicated to accelerating the implementation of biomedical advances
through pursuit of team-based translational science; 2) Increase recruitment efforts of Scholars from
underrepresented groups in biomedical sciences; 3) Provide the necessary infrastructure and protected time for
Scholars to develop skills in the seven Translational Science characteristics through mentored, didactic, and
experiential learning in a format adapted to their specific needs; 4) Empower Scholars with the necessary
leadership, management, well-being, and resilience skills and diversity, equity and inclusion training needed to
lead diverse and inclusive research programs through didactic and experiential trainings, career coaching and
career development experiences; 5) Prepare Scholars to identify and address health disparities through focused
trainings and applied experiences in systems science, health equity and community/stakeholder engagement;
6) Optimize mentoring committee-Scholar relationships by requiring mentor and mentee training based on
evidence-informed mentoring practices and active assessment of mentoring relationships; 7) Develop Scholars
into effective mentors for mentees from diverse backgrounds through didactic training and mentor skills
development; 8) Integrate Scholars into programs and services of the current and planned local UM1 and
companion grants and the CTSA Consortium. Our approach is to foster Scholars in embracing a translational
science mindset using a “cohort training model” that we have leveraged successfully at UNC, immersing
Scholars in the frameworks, methods and operational principles used by their peers in other disciplines while
creating a support system that encourages retention in science. CTSA K12 Scholars will mature into productive
and independent translational scientists that will accelerate research findings into health and societal benefits by
approaching their science and leadership from a lens of equity."
10925155,"Project Summary
The goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular role of alternative splicing and phosphorylation of ATP-
citrate lyase (ACLY) exon 14 and how these events may connect to cellular pathways that promote tumor growth.
ACLY is the main source of glucose-derived, nonmitochondrial acetyl-CoA in the cell. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is an
essential building block for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, and nuclear acetyl-CoA participates in epigenetic
regulation via histone acetylation. Dysregulation of ACLY is associated with cancer and other metabolic
diseases, although recent data suggests that splice isoforms of ACLY can also play a major role in disease.
Specifically, full-length ACLY, rather than a major splice variant with exon 14 removed, is preferentially
expressed in many tumors compared to normal tissue. Moreover, exon 14 has several molecular features,
including its location on the protein surface, disordered structure, juxtaposition to putative nuclear localization
sequences, and a serine (S481) which is known to be phosphorylated, which make exon 14 a likely player in
ACLY regulation. Together, these observations justify my proposed studies to determine the role of exon 14 in
ACLY regulation and cancer. To carry out my studies, I have selected cell and mouse models of hepatocellular
carcinoma and colorectal cancer, both of which are cancer types that preferentially express full-length ACLY and
are known to have increased de novo lipogenesis, to study this phenotype. My strategy involves using
fluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation to study subcellular localization, metabolomics and
proteomics to determine metabolic/epigenetic consequences, and colony formation assays and mouse studies
to evaluate the tumor-promoting properties of ACLY isoforms and S481 mutants (Aim 1). Furthermore, I will
characterize the biochemical and structural underpinnings of these modulations by identifying exon 14-mediated
protein-protein interactions with genetically-encoded crosslinkers, performing comparative enzymatic and
thermal stability assays, and determining cryo-electron microscopy structures for comparison with the full-length
structure of ACLY (Aim 2). Together, these experiments will explain the molecular roles of exon 14, how
alternative splicing impacts cellular acetyl-CoA utilization, and how exon 14 inclusion may be supporting tumor
growth, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies."
10834165,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER), a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, drives
proliferation of breast cancer cells and is expressed in the majority of breast cancers. Tumors that express
ER account for the greatest number of breast cancer associated mortalities. While targeting the ligand-
dependent functions of receptor is a successful approach in the clinical management of breast cancer, ER
can be activated by other means. This alternative activity of ER can promote ligand-independent properties
and our lack of understanding of this activity creates a barrier to the clinical challenge of therapy resistance.
We have found that phosphorylation of ER can modulate the regulation of multiple aspects of ER biology
in tumor cells, including its fate and transcriptional function, in some cases leading to ligand-independence
and resistance to therapy. We recently described a genome-wide DNA binding (i.e. cistrome) analyses of
phosphorylated ER, specifically phosphorylation at Ser 118, and found that it has unique properties,
including a novel association with Grainyhead-like protein 2 (GRHL2), a developmental transcription factor
that has since been recognized to play a role in breast cancer. Based on these novel findings and additional
preliminary data, we hypothesize that pS118 and GRHL2 identify selective activities of ER that are
necessary for growth of therapy-resistant tumors. Toward addressing this hypothesis, we developed three
lines of research. Aim 1 exploits our cistromic analysis of pS118ER and a unique cohort of patient tumor
samples to define, for the first time, the pS118ER activity in ER+ therapy-resistant tumors. Aim 2 will test
the requirement for pS118ER and GRHL2 in growth and malignant phenotypes in cells bearing ER
mutations, a genetic form of therapy resistance. This aim will use newly derived CRISPR edited cell
models. Aim 3 will use novel DNA technologies to interrogate mechanisms of pS118ER and GRHL2
interactions on DNA and to develop DNA-targeting selective inhibitors. Collectively, these three aims will
employ patient samples, in vitro and in vivo approaches and unique technologies to interrogate how a post-
translationally modified variant of ER contributes to the aberrant ER activity in recurrent tumors."
10917369,"Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide, classified as a chemical threat agent by the
Department of Homeland Security because it can cause neurotoxicity if released into the civilian populations.
Under these circumstances, CPF and similar OP chemicals have a potential to cause long-term chronic multi
symptom illnesses (CMI), such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). To date,
many victims of the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack are still experiencing chronic health problems consisting of
cognitive difficulties, headaches, muscle weaknesses and fatigue, which negatively impact their quality of life.
Such symptoms are reported by individuals exposed to OP pesticides and are thought to be caused by
maladaptive immune responses7. As such, this proposal will investigate the role of CPF in maladaptive
immune responses to develop future approaches that mitigate long-term morbidity associated with CMI.
 Ordinarily, a small chemical is not antigenic, but when it forms adducts with endogenous proteins, it can be
recognized by the immune system as a foreign threat agent and provoke an adaptive immune response. Our
prior work in this area shows that certain pesticide metabolites can form adducts with proteins and then elicit
an adaptive immune response, activating T- and B-cells that ultimately contribute to the production of
antibodies against them and corresponding with brain inflammation. Accounts of acute CPF poisoning in
humans support this notion by showing that CPF or CPF-oxon (CPO) can form adducts on several amino acid
residues in human albumin, which are considered biomarkers of OP exposure. However, it is unknown whether
these CPF/CPO-protein adducts have a role in activating the immune system. We therefore hypothesize that
CPF/CPO-protein adducts formed in vivo after CPF exposure can activate T-cell and B-cell responses,
resulting in antibody production. We propose that CPF-protein specific antibodies may cross-react with brain
proteins and contribute to the development of chronic autoimmune disorders. The proposed work builds upon
an existing scientific premise of pesticide-mediated maladaptive immune responses. These studies will
characterize whether acute CPF administration stimulates immune cells and whether this corresponds with
activation of the microglia and astroglia and neuroinflammation after CPF exposure. We will determine whether
brain immune activation is associated with formation of CPF/CPO-protein adducts. We will examine the
presence of immune cells that recognize CPF/CPO-modified proteins and antibodies against them to
determine if blood antibodies can cross-react with brain proteins. Understanding the mechanisms of OP-
induced CMI will facilitate the development of countermeasure efforts that target the immune system in order to
minimize long-term morbidity associated with such illnesses in civilian populations following a mass chemical
attack with CPF or similar chemicals."
10885002,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) disruptors are cutaneous poisons that cause the epidermis to detach from the dermis, an
effect that results in skin blistering (vesication). The prototype DEJ disruptor is mechlorethamine (MEC), a nitrogen
mustard; however, the toxicodynamic mechanisms involved in vesication by MEC and other DEJ disruptors remains
mostly undescribed in the scientific literature. The overall goal of the work proposed here is to investigate the
toxicodynamic mechanisms associated with DEJ disruption. This will be achieved by studying the role of mast cell
derived mediators (histamine and the serine protease tryptase), neutrophil-derived mediators (myeloperoxidase, MPO and
matrix metalloproteinase-9, MMP-9) and keratinocyte-specific collagens (collagen IV, COL4 and collagen XVII, COL17)
in the response of skin to MEC. In Aim 1 of the proposal, the hypothesis that mast cell-derived mediators influence DEJ
disruption will be evaluated. To this end, mouse ear skin will be topically exposed to saline (naïve), dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO, vehicle) or MEC. Additional groups of mice will be treated 20 min prior to exposure to saline, vehicle or MEC
with the antihistamine doxepin (5% cream administered topically) or the tryptase inhibitor leupeptin (at test doses of 10 or
30 mg/kg, ip). All ear tissues will be harvested at 2, 8 or 24 hr and either fixed for histopathologic analysis or
homogenized and assayed for the presence of histamine via ELISA and tryptase via western blotting. In Aim 2 of the
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that neutrophil-derived MMP-9 contributes to DEJ disruption by MEC. To test this
hypothesis, we will analyze naïve, vehicle and MEC-treated mouse ear biopsies from wildtype and Mmp9 -/- knockout
mice obtained at 2, 8 or 24 hr after exposure for the presence of DEJ disruption using light microscopy and for the
presence of myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil-selective marker, using immunohistochemistry (IHC). In Aim 3 of the
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that MEC promotes blistering by interfering at the level of epidermal keratinocytes
and affecting the expression of key keratinocyte-expressed collagens involved in maintaining the DEJ, namely COL4 and
COL17. To test this hypothesis, we will analyze mouse ear biopsies from the time points and samples described above for
Aim 1 but here carry out IHC on the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues to evaluate how the expression of these two
proteins, COL4 and COL17, changes over time after following exposure to MEC. In addition, experiments in Aim 3 will
utilize human 3D skin cultures exposed to MEC for 2, 8 or 24 hr to investigate effects on COL4 and COL17 protein
expression in human tissues. All in all, the proposal seeks to investigate three related yet independent hypotheses that will
shed new light on the toxicodynamic mechanisms used by DEJ disruptors to cause blisters and will uncover novel targets
for the purpose of reducing chemically induced cutaneous blistering. The work proposed here will provide a broad,
“whole tissue” toxicodynamic response to injury by MEC at the levels of the cutaneous mast cells, the infiltrating
neutrophils and the epidermal keratinocytes and will be complemented by the 3D human skin study. Most importantly,
students involved in this project will learn a wide range of skills including experimental design, animal care, animal
dosing, histology techniques, IHC, western blotting and how to use ImageJ software to assess tissue protein expression."
10835923,"Project Summary
 Alternative splicing generates transcripts that vary between tissues and cell types, and
contributes to cell differentiation and organ development. Despite its importance in development and
cell identity, alternative splicing is usually neglected in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
analysis. This is due to the challenge in identifying confident alternative splicing events from scRNA-
seq data, which are limited in read-depth, and comes with large amount of noise due to variation in
molecule capture efficiency, amplification bias, and excessive zero-counts or dropouts. We propose
a novel approach to infer differential splicing based on short-read full-length scRNA-seq data,
utilizing read counts mapping to adjacent exons. In addition, we plan to systematically evaluate
existing approaches to answer questions on the strategy regarding the variable, pooling and
dispersion estimates. Finally, we will assess the accuracy of short read based methods by comparing
against scRNA-seq generated with new types of protocols. The work proposed will increase our
understanding on the utility and limitations of short read scRNA-seq data, and provide a better
pipeline for alternative splicing analysis in scRNA-seq."

This is a new Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) T34 to support undergraduate training at Emory
University. The proposed training builds on an expiring (ends in 2023 when the proposed MARC T34 would start)
Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) program that combines undergraduate and graduate
programming. The proposed MARC T34 adds innovative components focused on providing undergraduate
students with inquiry-based research experiences and an inclusive, supportive community so they can complete
their baccalaureate degree, transition into, and complete biomedical, research-focused higher degree programs
(e.g., PhD or MD/PhD). Research training opportunities at Emory include a broad array of biomedical, public
health, and other STEM disciplines. An interdisciplinary academic culture and environment coupled with
extensive expertise in biomedical research makes Emory a fertile environment for training the next generation
of scientific leaders. This ambitious proposed T34 will support a cohort of 20 MARC Scholars (10 juniors and 10
seniors) starting in the summer prior to junior year through graduation. MARC activities are designed to
complement degree requirements to avoid an undue added burden on MARC Scholars. The primary activity
supporting the proposed MARC training is an existing 1-credit Professional Development Seminar, which
provides an inclusive community that bolsters scientific identity, includes skills-based learning to supplement
discipline-based training, and provides access to professional development and networking opportunities. Other
MARC training activities use evidence-informed approaches to train students in important scientific practices
such as data reproducibility and responsible conduct of research. Innovative aspects of the program include an
experienced and diverse MPI leadership team that brings distinct skills to student training, including dedicated
effort from the Senior Director of Undergraduate Research Programs. A full-time MARC Assistant Director brings
extensive experience in driving student success and retention through academic programming and counseling
to the leadership team, while a Graduate Student liaison serves as a role model and near-peer mentor. This
multi-level mentoring structure allows individualized attention to the success and wellbeing of MARC Scholars.
Furthermore, the T34 mandates annual mentor training for ALL faculty preceptors to build an inclusive research
environment. The depth of the pool of admitted students who would be eligible for T34 support combined with
the track record of training and the potential for enhanced impact provide strong rationale for this proposed
training program. The specific objectives are to: 1) recruit ~100 students from underrepresented groups at Emory
during the 5-year term of the T34 and provide these students with the tools to complete their BS degrees in a
timely fashion, proceed to a PhD or MD/PhD, and plot a successful career trajectory in the biomedical workforce;
and 2) ensure that MARC Scholars acquire agency as scientists by contributing to at least one publication, which
may be published after they graduate, and presenting their work both locally and at a national scientific meeting."
10786077,"The long-term goal of this technology development project is to improve rehabilitation of Veterans suffering
from lung disease through the development of the first truly portable, biocompatible, artificial lung capable of
short and long term respiratory support. Current artificial lungs have recently been used to rehabilitate lung
disease patients; however, significant advances in gas exchange, biocompatibility, and portability are required
to fully realize their potential. Microfluidic artificial lungs promise to enable a new class of truly portable artificial
lungs through feature sizes and blood channel designs that closely mimic those found in their natural
counterpart. However, current microfabrication techniques limit the microfluidic networks in these devices to
two dimensions, thereby severely limiting potential device topologies and resulting in inefficient blood
distribution networks. Further, current construction techniques may not be suitable for the large area
production required for human applications. In this study, we will for the first time harness high resolution 3D
polymer printing technology to create large area microfluidic lungs with truly three dimensional blood flow
networks and topologies. Constructed 3D printed microfluidic artificial lungs will exhibit gas exchange suitable
for some human applications, while using a fraction of the blood contacting surface area, blood volume, and
total volume of current commercial devices. The objectives of the current technology-development Merit
proposal are thus to: 1) optimize resin [resolution, permeability, toxicity, and blood compatibility] for microfluidic
artificial lungs; 2) Construct an adult-scale 3D printed microfluidic lung and validate in vitro; and, 3) Acute and
chronic in vivo testing of an adult-scale µAL. At the conclusion of this study, we will be ready to for extended
testing of our 3D printed microfluidic artificial lungs in a large animal model and for scaling up to larger rated

10913975,"Ninety percent of stroke survivors have clinically significant gait impairments that lead to secondary
medical complications, including cardiovascular deconditioning and reduced quality of life (QOL). Several
rehabilitative interventions that increase the level of activity and mobility have been shown to be beneficial.
Challenges posed by most of these locomotor gait training interventions require recurring visits to a
rehabilitation center. The recent development of novel powered exoskeletons offers a potential mechanism for
stroke survivors to improve mobility in the home and community. Although the predominant research using
these devices have been in persons with spinal cord injury, there are currently two devices approved by the FDA
for use in patients with stroke and additional devices are being developed. The Keeogo powered orthotic
exoskeleton is a novel device intended for persons with stroke who can ambulate but have gait impairment. This
device consists of a ridged orthotic structure placed over clothing on the legs and batteries to the power motors
that assist both knees in gait movement. The system monitors hip movement driven by the user and interprets
this movement to apply the appropriate assistance at the knee joint. This unique approach makes learning
intuitive, enabling the user only to acclimate to the system rather than learning how to control the device to
initiate the desired movement.
 This proposal is a randomized controlled pilot study. Fifteen veterans with chronic stroke (>6months)
and who retain some ability to take steps but have impaired gait will be recruited. Ten participants will be
randomized into the exoskeleton group and 5 into the control group. Both groups will be asked to complete 36
one-hour sessions of ambulation training. The exoskeleton group will train using the Keeogo powered orthotic
exoskeleton and the control group will train without using their own conventional aide.
 The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of training with this exoskeleton and its ability to improve
transfers to standing and sitting as assessed by the five times sit-to-stand test. A secondary aim will be to assess
effects of the device during overground ambulation. Outcome measurements to investigate changes of knee range
of motion and loading of the paretic limb will be accomplished using an instrumented goniometer; changes in
limb loading will be monitored using a foot pressure mapping system; and stepping parameters will be recorded
using the GaitRite carpet. An exploratory outcome of changes in energy expenditure during ambulation with and
without the powered exoskeleton will be assessed from a 6-minute walking test using a portable metabolic cart.
Additional exploratory outcome measures of QOL will be determined using the SF-36 and the Stroke Specific
Quality of Life Scale.
 Baseline testing for both groups will be performed while ambulating without the device and prior to
starting in the training program. The exoskeleton group will repeat testing within the first 3 sessions of the
training program. Post assessments will be obtained after 36 sessions of training. Retention will be assessed by
repeating the assessments without the exoskeleton after 1 month of stopping the training program.
 It is anticipated that longitudinal training with the device will increase number of squats achievable,
increase knee flexion during swing, increase loading of the paretic limb, and induce symmetrical stepping. No
immediate effect on energy expenditure by the device is expected however, a training effect is expected to
demonstrate improvement in the energy cost of ambulation. Any gains observed during this study may not be
retained, but as this device has the potential to be used in the home and community environment, justifying a
prescription of this device for retention purposes may be warranted. Use of this device may also lead to
improvement of QOL."
10894613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The U.S. experience with COVD-19 vaccination has shown that an individual's decision to vaccinate stems from
many factors, including beliefs related to vaccine safety1; the norms of family, peers, and community2,3; media
sources4; and federal, state, and local policy5,6. Many of these factors stem from a historical evolution and
regional idiosyncrasies, including regional differences in vaccination exemptions, levels of state funding, public
health communications, religious and political sentiments, and, often, longstanding reluctance to vaccinate.
Although there is evidence that these factors contribute to vaccination in several domains, no past research has
examined the ecology of this evolution for any vaccine. As a result, if a new HIV vaccine were introduced in the
near future, comprehensive, rigorous knowledge about the impact of vaccine factors, information circulating in
the community, norms, and public health policies would be paramount. This project will investigate the interplay
of these ecological factors at the state or county level, to predict over-time changes in individual intentions to
vaccinate against HIV if a vaccine were approved, as well as individual vaccination against other diseases such
as influenza, Hepatitis A, and COVID-19 among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM). The project will study the
impact of the ecology of vaccination on a future HIV vaccine by linking longitudinal surveys of diverse MSM (N
= 1500) to state/county/zip code data on community-based vaccine information in the media, vaccination norms,
as well as vaccine and HIV policy, including LGBT friendly policies and public health communications in the
media. After understanding key factors affecting HIV vaccination intentions, we will conduct an experiment with
another sample of diverse MSM (N = 1,000; Aim 2). Participants will be randomized to conditions of different
vaccine characteristics, information in the community, vaccination norms, and public health policies, and then
complete measures of vaccine choices and intentions; the choice to enroll in a vaccination trial registry and the
choice to sign up for an educational session about HIV-vaccine science as the behavioral endpoints for our
experiment. Participants will also complete measures of behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norms as
the possible mediators of effects of our choice and intention outcomes. The project will be informed by extensive
pilot data on vaccine policy, public health communications about vaccines and HIV, and vaccine misinformation
across states and over time, as well as experience recruiting and managing cohorts of MSM and investigating
the acceptability of an HIV vaccine in this population. The team includes expertise in public health, psychology,
HIV medicine and HIV vaccine trials, communication, public policy, and economics, and will leverage the
resources of the University of Pennsylvania, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Penn CFAR, and the
Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) to conduct cutting edge research about the determinants of vaccination
against HIV. The data obtained from this innovative project will supply the evidence base to inform policies and
public health communications to promote a future HIV vaccine and other recommended vaccines among MSM."
10886507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the past twenty years, thousands of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been discovered as potential
regulators of gene expression. Within this group, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as essential
mediators of post-transcriptional gene regulation, and defects in specific miRNA pathways have been
linked to numerous human diseases. While a basic understanding of how miRNAs are expressed and
function has been achieved, outstanding questions regarding the regulation of miRNA biogenesis and
target recognition in vivo remain to be solved. Caenorhabditis elegans worms have proven to be an
advantageous model to investigate miRNA biology at the organismal level. The development of
sensitive biochemical methods, unique worm strains, extensive genomic datasets, and robust
computational pipelines has enabled novel insights into miRNA expression and targeting in the context
of a developing animal. Utilizing and further innovating these resources and methods, the proposed
research will contribute to a better understanding of how miRNAs find and regulate targets within a live
animal under ideal as well as stressful conditions. With a confident set of targets bound by the miRNA
complex in vivo, features that underlie the different mechanisms deployed to regulate them will be
deduced. The identification of numerous ncRNAs, including miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs), induced by heat shock in C. elegans sets a foundation for discovering new mechanisms for
regulating gene expression in response to this stress. The discovery that the miRNA pathway plays a
key role during heat shock recovery, highlights the importance of this under-explored phase of the heat
shock response. The current research is focused on elucidating how the expression of specific miRNAs
and lncRNAs is regulated by heat shock and, in turn, how these ncRNAs function to protect the
organism during this stress. Over the next five years, these studies have the potential to reveal novel
roles for ncRNAs in response to heat shock and set the stage for investigating the impact of ncRNA
pathways in the organismal response to other stresses, including disease states. The long-term goal
of this research program is to contribute new insights into how ncRNAs control gene expression under
varied conditions in an intact organism. Furthermore, knowledge gained from these studies has the
potential for significant impact on the design and utilization of RNA-based therapeutics for the treatment
of human disease."
10832566,"Project Summary/Abstract: As many as 35% of older adult cancer survivors (OACS; ≥65 years, ≥1-year post-
treatment) have clinically significant depression. Presently, 64% of cancer survivors are ≥65 years old, and that
number will increase to 73% by the year 2040. Thus, the number of depressed OACS will exceed 6 million as
the U.S. population continues to age. Even if OACS pursue depression treatment, they may not receive
developmentally appropriate services because the geriatric mental health workforce is too small to meet the
needs of this growing population in oncology. Therefore, OACS are a uniquely high-risk group for untreated
depression in need of novel, widely disseminable treatment strategies. Yet, no studies have evaluated the
implementation of evidence-baseddepression treatment for older adults through cancersurvivorship clinics. The
current proposal adopts an implementation science framework to target depression in OACS. Dr. Saracino
proposes the adaptation of Behavioral Activation (BA) as a promising, straightforward treatment to increase
OACS’ engagement in evidence-based depression treatment. Using an exploratory sequential mixed methods
design, including a small open pilot and randomized control trial, this study has three specific aims: 1) To obtain
feedback from key stakeholders (i.e., OACS, social workers, survivorship clinic clinicians ) to revise the BA
manual content and procedures and develop an understanding of barriers to treatment engagement in OACS;
2) To evaluate implementation outcomes (i.e., appropriateness, acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity,
penetration, and sustainability) of BA in cancer survivorship; and 3) To determine the preliminary effects of BA
on depression (primary outcome), anxiety, coping, and behavioral activation (secondary outcomes) compared
to a Supportive Psychotherapy (SP) control arm. Completion of this project will facilitate Dr. Saracino’s long term
career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in the dissemination and implementation
(D&I) of mental health screening and treatment for older adults across the cancer trajectory . In the context of a
supportive, enriching environment with a strong mentorship team of national and inte rnational experts, Dr.
Saracino will acquire advanced training in 5 areas critical to her success as an independent investigator: 1)
Cancer Survivorship; 2) Geriatric Mental Health Research; 3) D&I Science; 4) Mixed Methods; and 5)
Longitudinal Data Analysis. Dr. Saracino has outlined a comprehensive 5-year training plan that includes guided
mentoring, formal coursework, seminars, onlinetrainings, national conferences, and hands-on researchactivities
that directly parallel her training goals. This proposal is responsive to the NCI’s call for research on cancer
survivorship and older adults, and the Cancer Moonshot Initiative Blue Ribbon Panel Working Group on
Implementation Science’s recommendation that implementation research should be conducted on how to tailor
and deploy evidence-based interventions at multiple levels (e.g. individuals, providers, systems, communities)
and in different clinical and community settings to maximize symptom control."
10813757,"ABSTRACT
 Discovery in biological sciences has shifted to increasingly rely on high throughput multi-omic data. The
advent of single cell (sc) transcriptomics further revolutionized research in our field, given the intricate structure
of the inner ear organs consisting of numerous distinct cell types that function in concert to properly sense
hearing and balance. Harnessing the wealth of existing and future multi-omic, multi-modality and multi-species
data is challenged by their ever-increasing data size and relative inaccessibility to biologists that are not trained
in bioinformatics. The gEAR, gene Expression Analysis Resources (umgear.org), is a cloud-based `one-stop-
shop' where inner ear-related multi-omic data can be explored and analyzed by biologists without requiring
programming skills. Over the past five years, the gEAR has become a critically valuable resource to our field.
The impact of the gEAR on the field is reflected by its 846 registered users, 440 datasets (over 70 organized in
thematic profiles in the public domain), and thousands of monthly visits.
 The goal of this proposal is to implement necessary improvements in the gEAR that will significantly
enhance the ability of researchers to infer biological insights from the omics data generated by their own
laboratories and from omics datasets in the public domain. We will: (1) continuously upload and curate ear-
related multi-omic data from contributing laboratories and the public domain; (2) construct an integrated
epigenetic and transcriptomic atlas of the developing and mature mouse cochlea (a) as a necessary scaffold
for cross dataset integration, and (b) as necessary data for bridging the gap between gene expression and
gene regulation; (3) implement advanced bioinformatic analytical tools in the gEAR; (4) enhance the user-
interface; (5) make scalability, performance and stability improvements; (6) integrate the gEAR with analytical
notebooks to allow more complex analyses with minimal training; and (7) continue our education and outreach
efforts. In addition to user-surveys, we will establish both user and technology expertise advisory boards to
provide feedback and guide development.
 Diverse expertise is required for the efficient operation and development of the gEAR bioinformatics
platform. Our multi-disciplinary team members are a surgeon-scientist (PI), bioinformaticians (Co-Is), biologists
and engineers. Our experience in turning the gEAR from an abstract idea to a successful platform, widely
adapted in the ear field, and with multiple successful clones including NeMO Analytics (nemoanalytics.org) for
the BRAIN initiative should attest to our experience, expertise, and ability to deliver. Completion of the
proposed gEAR advancements will boost fulfillment of the great promises expected from omics data
generation and analyses and foster reuse of existing data, thereby catalyzing both basic science discovery and
advance development and translation of therapeutics for hearing and balance disorders."
10874397,"Skin cancer is a significant and expensive public health problem, with ~5 million Americans treated at a cost of
over $8 billion annually 29. Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer, and its incidence has more than tripled in the
last four decades 30,31. Indoor tanning (IT) is a well-established cause of melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas 8-
12,20-22,32. Indoor tanners are also more likely to experience sunburn 3,4,33, a major risk factor for skin cancer 9,14-19.
Most tanners begin IT as teens or young adults 31. In order to reduce IT and protect this at-risk population, IT is
now being regulated in two ways. First, states restrict access by minors or require parental
consent/accompaniment 34. Second, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) attempts to minimize harm from IT
devices (e.g., protective eyewear, session duration limits) 35. Although underutilized36, legislation such as age
restrictions and taxation has been quite successful in decreasing engagement in other risky behaviors such as
smoking 37. Recent evidence suggests that more stringent IT laws such as age bans (vs. parent consent laws or
no law) are associated with less youth IT 38,39. Unfortunately, enforcement and compliance with IT laws are
variable and inadequate 28,40-44. When advocating for more stringent laws or enforcement, it is also important to
attend to concerns about secondary effects that may be barriers to further restriction. These barriers include
economic impacts of IT laws that may cause small businesses to organize and oppose progressive IT laws to
protect their financial interests, and tanners switching to use IT beds outside of salons (e.g., homes, apartments,
gyms) that are not well-regulated or inspected 45-50. The goals of this five-year R01 are to use a mixed-method
approach informed by the Multiple [Policy] Streams and RE-AIM 51,52 Frameworks 53 to investigate three specific
aims. Aim 1 is a comparative case study to elucidate the IT legislation adoption process. Aim 2 uses a pseudo-
patron (confederate) assessment, national survey, and archival data to investigate legislation implementation,
i.e., regulation compliance in salons and non-salons and the association of compliance with policy stringency
and enforcement provisions 41 as well as IT and sunburn outcomes among adolescents and young adults. Aim 3
integrates data from the first two aims and external data to assess economic effects relevant to policy
sustainability of IT stringency, enforcement, and compliance. The scientific premise derives from the paucity
of research on the process of translating IT policy efforts into stringent IT legislation and compliance, as well as
their effects 54,55, such as positive outcomes on melanoma risk factors (IT, sunburns) and secondary effects
(economic costs, compensatory tanning). Results of this comprehensive, multi-level, rigorous analysis will inform
IT policy interventions as well as other health policy arenas and guide best practices for increasing IT law
stringency, moving toward an IT “endgame” 56,57. These could include adding age bans to parental consent laws
or increasing age bans to 19 or 21, similar to tobacco. As experts in the relevant content and methodologic
domains, our Multiple-PI led team is well-poised to conduct this innovative, seminal research."
10841720,"Project Summary
Genetic variations, environmental exposures, and their interactions underlie the etiology of all human
diseases. While genome-wide association studies have revealed many trait-associated genetic variants
and epidemiological studies have pinpointed myriad disease-associated environmental factors, the role
of their interactions is much less explored, mainly due to the lack of very large population cohorts, high-
quality environmental measures, and efficient tools. This proposal aims to characterize gene-
environment interactions (GEI) in both human evolution and complex traits. Genetic and polygenic
adaptations to local environments during human evolution have shaped the gene-environment
relationship and the genetic architecture of complex traits. Leveraging the growing number of ancient
DNA, we will first develop and apply statistical tests to identify genetic and polygenic responses to the
Agricultural Revolution. The findings of adaptive genetic variants and polygenic traits will inform our
understanding and study of the current epidemics of complex diseases, which are likely results of
present-day gene-lifestyle mismatches. Second, to directly identify and quantify GEI in complex traits,
we will develop an efficient computational pipeline and perform large-scale interaction analysis across
the genome, phenome, and selected high-quality environmental factors in UK Biobank. All summary
statistics will be released publicly as a database on a dedicated website to fuel further explorations,
such as meta-analysis and testing for replicability across cohorts and ancestries. Third, to assist and
guide future GEI studies, we will develop the first bioinformatics tool for phenome-wide interaction study
(PheWIS) of target genetic variants and environmental exposures, enabling efficient and unbiased
search for environment-modifiable phenotypic effects. Moreover, to alleviate the multiple testing burden
in GEI studies with a large number of exposures and clinical outcomes, we will examine if Mendelian
randomization analysis coupled with phenome-wide association study (PheWAS-MR) could be an
effective way to prioritize potentially causal exposure-outcome relationships, which may increase the
statistical power of detecting GEI and assist the downstream search for functional mechanisms. Lastly,
as an effort to improve the portability of polygenic score (PGS) across ancestries and subgroups with
the same ancestry, we will use simulated and empirical data to test if explicit statistical modeling of GEI
could mitigate the problem. Concurrently, we will examine if PGS-environment interaction analysis is
an effective approach to identify actionable environmental exposures that attenuate genetic risks.
Overall, this proposed research will generate new methods, computational tools, database resources,
and novel insights into the general patterns of GEI in human complex traits."
10844478,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes a teacher education initiative, 'Teaching the Genome Generation'
(TtGG), to provide pre-service high school teachers the content knowledge, teaching strategies, and resources
needed to enhance student learning in genomics, bioethics, and bioinformatics, with an emphasis on math and
data literacy. Our pre-professional development program will provide instruction in the molecular genetics of
personalized medicine, use of bioinformatics tools, incorporating statistics and data analysis, and discussion of
the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) surrounding genetics research. In collaboration with partners in
higher education, up to 32 pre-service teachers per year will participate in a hands-on short course. Pre-service
teachers will also have the opportunity to engage with and practice teaching our curriculum through instructional
methods coursework and student teaching/internships. Our innovative approach weaves three learning
strands—molecular genetics, bioinformatics and bioethics—together within the context of the Next Generation
Science Standards and Common Core Math Standards. The TtGG team will expand dissemination of our content
and short course through significant enhancement of our online resources. A pilot online course will be launched
in late 2020, and a full online program with additional resources accessible through a newly designed TtGG
public facing website will be completed and released by the first quarter of 2022. To evaluate the impact of the
short course, evaluators will administer pre and post surveys to pre-service teacher participants on genetics,
genomics and bioinformatics content knowledge, teacher self-efficacy, and confidence. Evaluators will also
conduct small scale efficacy studies to examine the impact of the TtGG materials on students': a) content
knowledge of genetics, genomics, and applications of mathematics; b) confidence engaging in genomics
concepts, lab activities, and math problems; c) interest in engaging in additional genomics-related behavior,
including academic and career pursuits; and d) ability to explain how and why math skills are required for
practicing life sciences. By training pre-service educators, TtGG will execute on NIH's goal of strengthening the
future STEM workforce through increasing genomic and health literacy."
10845509,"Project Summary/Abstract
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) represent a heterogeneous and poorly understood
pathological group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas associated with poor prognosis. Despite major
progress in recent years in the identification of genomic drivers in PTCL, understanding their
mechanisms of transformation and identifying therapeutic targets remain a high priority in the
field. Recently we have identified novel genetic alterations in the VAV1 oncogene in PTCL using
a combination of RNAseq analysis and targeted sequencing of candidate genes. Most VAV1
genomic alterations are fusions and small intragenic deletions affecting the C-terminal domain of
the protein. Our central hypothesis is that the VAV1 alterations lead to increase activation of
signaling pathways downstream of VAV1 and act as oncogenic drivers of PTCL. Our preliminary
results demonstrate that expression of the recurrent Vav1-myo1f fusion induces lymphomas that
recapitulate the histology and molecular pathology of high-risk PTCL. The goals of this project are
to characterize the mechanisms by which VAV1-MYO1F fusion promotes lymphomagenesis in
vivo and to explore emerging specific therapeutic vulnerabilities in PTCL preclinical models."
10837863,"DNA is the blueprint of life and DNA replication and maintenance are essential for human health.
Damages on DNA due to endogenous or environmental assaults can hamper DNA replication and
induce genome abnormities and human diseases. A replisome is a multi-protein complex responsible
for DNA replication. Moreover, as the first one to meet any replication barrier, the replisome plays
essential roles in signaling replication stress and facilitating DNA repair. However, the structural basis
of replisome operation and replisome mediated replication stress response and repair remains unclear.
We propose to use biochemical reconstitution and cryo-EM structural determination to investigate how
the replisome acts under normal and stressed conditions and how disfunction of the replisome leads to
genetic variations and human diseases. First, we will employ replisome from bacteriophage T7 as a
model system to investigate the structural basis of replisome operation under stressed conditions. I
have recently obtained the first structure of the T7 replisome operating on its DNA substrate, which
illustrated the organization and the working mechanism of a replisome. We will further investigate how
the T7 replisome responses to various replication barriers to trigger appropriate replication-coupled
repair. Second, we will investigate the structural basis of mitochondria DNA replication. Mitochondria
is the power house of a cell and errors on mitochondria DNA due to faulty DNA replication are
connected to many human genetic diseases. We will reconstitute the mitochondria replisome and
investigate how mitochondria DNA is replicated and how mutations on mitochondria replisome lead to
human diseases. Our investigations will provide the first structural framework for understanding
replisome mediated DNA replication, stress response and repair. The structural information will
contribute to the development of novel therapies to target or avoid targeting DNA replication."
10842233,"Systemic lupus erythematosus afflicts 1 to 2 million Americans and is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. While wiser use of immunosuppressive drugs and prompt treatment of
complications have improved the overall survival and quality of life, we still lack specific drugs,
full understanding of the involved pathogenic processes and valuable disease biomarkers. In
addition, our understanding of local, organ-specific mechanisms involved in the execution of
tissue injury is limited. An expanded population of T cells missing CD4 and CD8 from the
surface (double negative T cells) in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus, helps autologous B cells to produce immunoglobulin and dsDNA antibodies,
produces the proinflammatory interleukin 17 and invades tissues to cause inflammation. This
application proposes the use of state-of-the-art new technologies including spectral cytometry,
single cell RNA sequencing and series of novel engineered mice to study the diversity of the
double negative T cell population in the peripheral blood and kidneys of lupus-prone mice and
people with systemic lupus erythematosus and understand how an inflammatory environment
contributes to their generation. In parallel, experiments are proposed to understand how
inflammatory cytokines act on kidney resident cells to enable the establishment of inflammation.
The proposed experiments will inform the development of approaches to suppress the
generation of pathogenic double negative T cells and prevent the establishment of tissue
inflammation."
10837887,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of translational research to eradicate human
disease, tackle emerging public health threats and promote health, especially in hard-to-reach communities that
face health disparities. To take on these challenges, we need a diverse, well-resourced, and well-trained
research workforce, as highlighted by the NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce report. 1 The VCU Wright Regional
Center for Clinical and Translational Science (Wright Regional CCTS) serves a region in Central and Eastern
Virginia and North Carolina that includes both rural and urban underserved communities and has vast experience
serving a diverse community of patients who often face health disparities. The nature of our environment has
driven the development of a research workforce that is prepared to meet the challenge of engaging and serving
diverse patients. The Wright Regional CCTS serves as the hub for providing the translational research
infrastructure for the training and career development of scholars through their professional life cycle. In addition,
The Wright Center CCTS has a $32 million endowment with which we have established the first Wright Faculty
Scholars in Health Disparities program. This program supports early career faculty from diverse backgrounds
who are committed to better understanding the drivers and developing solutions to health inequities in our
communities. Our existing partner institutions bring experience training the workforce across the translational
spectrum with an emphasis on community engaged research (Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS)),
informatics (Old Dominion University (ODU)) and mentorship (Virginia State University (VSU), an HBCU).
 Training scholars to translate research observations to clinical application in our unique
communities is a priority for the proposed K12 Training Program. Our program will continue its commitment
to providing early career faculty/late-stage postdoctoral fellows with a comprehensive “blueprint” for transitioning
to research independence. We will recruit scholars from a pool of early career scientists who are diverse in both
research discipline and demographics. Through integration with our UM1 and RC2 awards, K12 scholars will
be exposed to an innovative and comprehensive program that supports 75% committed time to scholar
specific domain expertise but also provides a combination of didactic, virtual, and experiential training in
fundamental characteristics of the translational scientist.
 We will achieve our goals through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Prepare early career translational researchers for research independence through comprehensive,
innovative, and individualized training in translational science. K12 scholars will be positioned to translate
preclinical, clinical, and community-based research to improving health of all communities.
Aim 2: Serve as an institutional resource for research career development and facilitate the creation of a diverse
community of clinical and translational researchers through both internal and external partnerships."

The mission of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) predoctoral T32 Program is to contribute
to the nation’s biomedical workforce by training a diverse pool of scientists in clinical and translational science
(CTS) and leadership. We will meet this mission by developing, implementing, and continually improving a
training program for predoctoral trainees (Scholars) that integrates a mentored research experience with an
individualized curriculum combined with professional development activities highlighting our institutional
strengths in community engagement, data science, team science, and effective communication skills. The
UMN CTSI T32 Program is built upon our current successful Translational Research and Career Development
(TRACT) TL1 program, which guided the development of early-stage CTS researchers over the past 4 years.
Through personalized mentorship, coursework, seminars, and other tools, the TRACT program has guided 18
predoctoral Scholars along a rigorous path of professional development in CTS. Moving forward, the new UMN
CTSI T32 Program’s mission is to educate and train a diverse group of Scholars from across the UMN system
in the fundamentals of CTS through a 2-year comprehensive yet individualized program that complements their
education and training in their interdisciplinary doctoral programs. We will recruit and train 3 cohorts (diverse in
discipline and underrepresented populations) of 8 predoctoral Scholars from across UMN. The UMN CTSI T32
will provide a research experience with mentors trained in evidence-based mentoring and collaboration with
community members throughout the research process, inclusive of a Community Mentor and team science
across the UMN ecosystem. The UMN CTSI T32 will also include near-peer learning experiences with other
CTSI program Scholars, as well as provide education and opportunities for a variety of career paths. The UMN
CTSI T32 will use a comprehensive and adaptive evaluation plan for rigorous programmatic assessment and
continuous quality improvement to maximize the training experience. The principal Scholar outcome is to have
a deep knowledge in the science of translation beyond translational research. Another key Scholar outcome is
an understanding of the importance of, and key strategies for, building truly collaborative interdisciplinary
teams composed of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences whose collective roles synergistically
optimize the advancement of diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications that
improve health. Other outcome measures include the ability to communicate and engage with other scientists
and nonscientific audiences and collaborators through our intensive formalized training in communicating
science and community engagement (i.e., the Community Mentor Program). Programmatic outcomes include
the development of training modules and workshops on the most effective community engagement and
communications strategies exportable to the national CTSA consortium."
10893320,"My laboratory is interested signal transduction by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with a specific focus on
the second messenger pathways downstream and how they drive physiology and pathophysiology in specific
cells and tissues. GPCRs signaling pathways are ubiquitous and conserved, with cellular responses determined
by 1) the specific GPCRs and G proteins expressed in the cell and 2) how the cells decode signals generated
by these receptors. My career has been focused on uncovering novel cellular signal transduction mechanisms
at a cellular and molecular level that move beyond a canonical GPCR paradigm where individual GPCRs simply
couple to 3 major signal transduction pathways, phospholipase C activation, adenylyl cyclase regulation, and
RhoGEF stimulation, and the cells do the rest. In this renewal application we propose to capitalize on advances
made in the previous funding in two general areas 1) Proteomic analysis of G protein α subunit-mediated signal
transduction pathways and; 2) intracellular signaling by β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) and phospholipase C in
cardiac myocytes. The first project is based on the striking success of our proteomic screens using proximity
labeling mass spectrometry that maintains cell context while identifying protein-protein interactions. We propose
to characterize two novel G protein targets from these screens that play roles in regulation of chromatin
remodeling and gene expression through mechanisms that would be unprecedented downstream of GPCRs. In
addition, we propose to leverage this method to identification of new signal pathways mediated by G proteins as
GPCRs move through the endocytic and recycling pathways. Intracellular signaling by GPCRs is a new and
emerging paradigm in the field but much less is known about intracellular G protein and effector engagement by
internal GPCRs. The second direction will be to follow up our finding that phospholipase C activity at the Golgi
apparatus is regulated by intracellular Golgi localized β1-adrenergic receptors (β1ARs). The proposed
experiments will test the hypothesis that intracellular β1ARs regulate a unique subset of genes in cardiac
myocytes related to cardiac hypertrophy through regulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis at the Golgi
apparatus. We will determine what signaling pathways are regulated by Golgi β1ARs beyond the Epac-PLCε-
PKD signaling pathway that we have previously described. Finally, we will investigate the mechanisms for
pathways downstream of β2ARs that oppose hypertrophic β1AR signaling at the Golgi. This is exciting because
β1AR signaling in vivo is pro-hypertrophic while β2AR signaling is protective and will uncover a novel mechanism
for protective β2AR signaling. Overall, these experiments will reveal novel signaling mechanisms that have
implications for therapies that target GPCRs."

10849665,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The Administrative Core of the P30 Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), under the
leadership of the Center Director’s Office, will facilitate and support the activities of all five Cores of CTBH, so
that all Cores collectively achieve the Overall Aim of the Center. Specifically, the Administrative Core will
enable the integration of expertise across multiple disciplines and provide an infrastructure to enhance the
quality, pace of achievement, and impact of innovative scientific research that combines science-based
behavior change interventions with state-of-the-science technologies to create, evaluate, and disseminate
digital therapeutics targeting substance use disorders (SUDs) and co-occurring conditions.
In our 9 years of funding thus far, we grounded the Core’s organizational structure, management approach and
communication infrastructure in empirically-based strategies to optimize communication, collaboration and
productivity among geographically dispersed teams. We have found this model to be particularly well-suited to
our Center, given the Center’s focus on transcending traditional models of intervention delivery to use state-of-
the-science technologies to overcome time and space constraints to deliver behavior change interventions in a
wide array of settings. Further, we have continually refined our approach based on lessons learned over 9
years of collaborations. In the renewal period, we plan to continue effective communication and collaboration
with our Center partners using approaches grounded in the empirical literature and in light of our experiences
to date.
This Core will provide scientific and programmatic leadership to ensure efficient and successful coordination
and integration of the activities across Center Cores. The overall programmatic structure and management
approach has been designed to ensure scientific leadership and direction (under the oversight of the Director’s

to enhance synergy among an interdisciplinary expert team by facilitating productive communication,
centralization of knowledge and resources, and integration of methods and results across individual research
projects."
10863831,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy
Vision loss from diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged
adults in the United States (US). Advanced diabetic retinopathy is referred to as proliferative diabetic
retinopathy (PDR). In many patients, blindness associated with PDR can be prevented with appropriate and
timely diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, some patients at high risk for PDR are not receiving adequate
eye care. More knowledge is needed about PDR outcomes in a real-world setting, and the differences between
published study outcomes and real-world effectiveness. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in nearly
90% of outpatient physician offices and can be a powerful tool for studying PDR in a real-world setting. The
goal of this proposal is to develop and validate EHR-based methods to improve outcomes in PDR. The study
aims are: (1) to classify patients with PDR in the EHR system using an automated method that incorporates
structured (e.g., diagnosis code, medications, labs) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes), (2) to predict
the progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy to PDR using a forecasting model with time-varying
covariates, and (3) to determine the real-world effectiveness of treatments for PDR in a large nationwide eye
dataset. The study will utilize data from the University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) De-Identified
Clinical Data Warehouse, a de-identified EHR with over 1 million patients that has available eye exam
information, and the Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry, a nationwide comprehensive eye database
that includes data from over 15,000 eye providers in the US with over 1 million patients with PDR. The
innovative methods and tools from this study can be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR-
based clinical studies in ophthalmology. The candidate, Dr. Catherine Sun is an ophthalmologist whose long-
term goal is to study real-world clinical outcomes in ophthalmology by conducting EHR-based pragmatic
clinical trials and using large-scale EHR data. While she possesses the foundational skills, additional mentored
training and coursework in data analytics, biomedical informatics, biostatistics, and advanced clinical trial
design and implementation will help her reach her goals. Her outstanding mentorship team of primary mentor
Dr. Nisha Acharya and co-mentors Dr. Travis Porco and Dr. Joshua Stein, and the exceptional environment of
the Department of Ophthalmology and the F.I. Proctor Foundation at UCSF will support Dr. Sun’s development
into an R01-funded independent investigator."
10837016,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal employs novel methods to identify key determinants and consequences of concurrent HIV
infection and regular cannabis use. We will acquire extensive phenotype data from peripheral and brain
markers of immune activation, brain structure, and neuropsychological performance (NP) in persons living
with HIV (PLWH) receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) (80 regular cannabis users and 80
non-users) and HIV uninfected (HIV-) controls (80 regular cannabis users and 80 non-users). Our overall
hypothesis is that cannabis use leads to increases in inflammation in the peripheral and brain compartments.
We also hypothesize that phenotypic signatures due to regular cannabis use and HIV will be delineated through
NP and brain volumetrics. In Aim 1 we hypothesize that regular cannabis use will increase both peripheral and
brain immune indices in PLWH on cART. In Aim 2 we hypothesize that regular cannabis use will lead to a
worsening of NP and reductions in brain volumetrics in both PLWH on cART and HIV- controls. This proposal
will provide key insights into the effects of regular cannabis and HIV on peripheral and brain markers of
immune function and NP in PLWH and HIV- controls. These insights are critical for cure strategies and
ongoing HIV treatment initiatives."
10920354,"Project Summary/Abstract
Enzymes that utilize iron-containing cofactors catalyze many different, often very difficult, chemical reactions that
are fundamentally important to central life processes, such as DNA biosynthesis and repair, gene regulation,
regulation of epigenetic inheritance, biosyntheses of numerous compounds with antibacterial and antifungal
activities. Dysfunction of these enzymes is often associated with the onset of severe diseases, e.g. cancer,
cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Strategies to harness the synthetic potential of these enzymes and to
treat diseases associated with their dysfunction involves the rational manipulation of these processes on a
molecular level, which requires a detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms, in particular how the enzymes
control the outcome of their reactions. The Bollinger/Krebs joint group specializes in combining transient-state
rapid kinetic experiments with various spectroscopic (e.g. stopped-flow absorption, freeze-quench EPR and
Mössbauer) and analytical (LC/MS) methods to monitor metalloenzyme reactions. In the last 20 years, our group
has successfully studied many mononuclear (MNHI) and dinuclear non-heme-iron (DNHI) enzymes by trapping
and characterizing key reaction intermediates in their catalytic cycles. We trapped and characterized high-spin
Fe(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediates in various MNHI enzymes. The ferryl intermediate initiates substrate oxidation,
typically by cleavage of an aliphatic C-H bond. The outcome of these reactions is diverse and includes
hydroxylation (the default outcome), halogenation, desaturation, epimerization, heterocyclization, and
endoperoxidation reactions. The current focus of our research aims at deciphering the factors that result in the
diverse outcomes. The long-term goal of this research is to lay the foundation for the rational manipulation of
these enzymes for biotechnological applications. In collaboration with the Boal group, the B/K group has
identified the heme-oxygenase diiron oxygenase (HDO) enzyme superfamily and currently studies several
HDOs. The PI also has a long-standing collaboration with the Booker group on mechanistic studies of radical S-
adenosylmethionine (RS) enzymes that catalyze formation of new C-S bonds. These enzymes use their [Fe4S4]RS
cluster to generate the canonical 5’-deoxy-adenos-5’-yl radical that initiates substrate oxidation by cleavage of
aliphatic C-H bonds and their auxiliary [Fe4S4] clusters as sulfur source. The current focus of the collaborative
research efforts on RS enzymes aim at delineating the reaction mechanisms of various RS enzymes involved in
formation of new C-S bonds."
10885908,"Project Summary
Both naturally occurring and laboratory protein modifications are important fields of research since proteins are
central to virtually every biological process. On one hand, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) are
essential for proper functioning of an organism and are associated with many diseases. It is of great
significance to study PTMs in order to develop new therapeutic agents. On the other hand, continuing
advances in noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis has provided powerful tools for the manipulation
and study of protein function. This MIRA application seeks to merge investigations on both fronts of these
research areas. The first general area of this MIRA project focuses on the co-translational modification of
protein through genetic code engineering. The long-term goal is to explore innovative strategies for ncAA
mutagenesis through reprogramming the genetic code. Our immediate and unique focus is on reprogramming
codon language with quadruplet codons (Qcodons), although triplet nonsense codons are the predominant
ones used in the field of genetic code expansion. Built on our pioneering efforts on tRNA engineering, we
propose a new direction to improve Qcodon decoding efficiency through the identification and implementation
of recoding signals. The use of recoding signals can also significantly mitigate a major concern over
undesirable readthrough of endogenous stop codons with nonsense suppression-based noncanonical amino
acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in live cell studies. We will also apply a Qcodon-dependent and ncAA-mediated
control strategy to the development of HIV-1 vaccines, which represents a novel direction that was first
demonstrated by my group. Such strategy will also be applied to the generation of vaccines against other
pathogenic viruses or bacteria in the future. The second general area of this MIRA project is to investigate the
role of protein tyrosine O-sulfation (PTS) in mammalian cell biology. Our initial efforts will focus on PTS of
chemokine receptors as the first step of our long-term efforts to study the effects of PTS on receptor signaling
in general. Furthermore, we seek to develop therapeutic agents targeting sulfated receptors. These two
innovative projects have their own goals and significance, but are unified under our expertise in
chemical/synthetic biology and are partially associated with each other. The long-term goal of my laboratory is
not only to develop innovative and meaningful chemical/synthetic biology tools, but also to employ these tools
to gain insights into biomedical processes for the development of novel therapeutics."
10834147,"SUMMARY: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is on pace to become the dominant form
of heart failure, yet we have no treatments to offer patients. Our preliminary data suggest that abnormalities in
skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity (SM OxPhos) may contribute to exertional intolerance. SM
OxPhos is a complex metric, incorporating both (a) intramuscular perfusion and (b) mitochondrial oxidative
reserve capacity, suggesting that both need to be measured to understand the mechanism underlying SM
OxPhos impairment. Our group has developed novel MRI sequences which can evaluate both measures.
Moreover, we have identified a unique metabolite signature in skeletal muscle biopsy samples from HFpEF
patients: a reduction in NAD+ and Propionyl-CoA, indicating metabolic perturbations that may lead to energetic
deficits and impair mitochondrial reserve.
 The goal of this proposal is to investigate the relationship between SM OxPhos and submaximal exercise
endurance in HFpEF, with the scientific premise that improvements in SM OxPhos will translate into
improvements in exercise endurance. We focus on submaximal exercise endurance as this better reflects the
level of exertion reached by HFpEF patients during daily activities. In Aim 1: We will test three interventions in
53 subjects with HFpEF in a cross-over trial: (1) Potassium nitrate (KNO3), which predominantly targets exercise
intramuscular perfusion; (2) The combination of KNO3 with nicotinamide riboside (NR) and Propionyl-L-Carnitine
(PLC), which targets both intramuscular perfusion and mitochondrial oxidative reserve capacity by replenishing
the identified metabolite deficiencies; and (3) Potassium chloride (active control). We hypothesize that while both
KNO3 and combination therapy will improve submaximal exercise endurance, combination therapy will lead to
greater overall increases. We will also assess the impact of our interventions on SM OxPhos, and the relationship
between SM OxPhos and submaximal exercise endurance. In Aim 2: we will test a new diagnostic strategy to
identify the mechanism underlying a specific HFpEF patient’s impaired SM OxPhos: the response to
supplemental oxygen (100% O2). The lack of SM OxPhos response to oxygen suggests that an impairment in
mitochondrial reserve is preventing the utilization of additional oxygen. We hypothesize that these patients will
derive greater benefit from combination therapy (KNO3+NR+PLC) by addressing mitochondrial reserve in
addition to increasing intramuscular perfusion.
 Our proposal will comprehensively assess the relationship between SM OxPhos and submaximal
exercise endurance using complimentary techniques. It will test novel therapeutics, with the primary goal of
improving submaximal exercise endurance and also identify which patients should be treated with which therapy.
This proposal has the potential to change the landscape of HFpEF therapeutics, giving us a mechanistically
rational strategy to offer relief to these otherwise limited patients."
10846709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cells employ different mechanisms to sense and respond to their environment and maintain tissue
homeostasis. Cells have evolved strategies to co-opt stable reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) as non-transcriptional signaling molecules in order to rapidly respond and adapt to
environmental changes. Numerous examples of the influence of H2O2 signaling have emerged, ranging from
abiotic stress in plants to immune responses in humans. H2O2 signaling and subsequent regulation of target
proteins is therefore an important but still underappreciated biological control mechanism. H2O2-regulated cell
signaling is largely dependent on the presence of redox-sensitive thiol switches in protein cysteine residues,
where the reactivity of these switches is highly dependent on the local H2O2 concentration. Our previous
studies in epithelial cells have shown that key determinants of cellular H2O2 concentrations include generation
of H2O2, by cell membrane surface enzymes such as the NADPH oxidases and permeability across cellular
membranes which can be facilitated by Aquaporin (AQP) channels. A number of cellular processes such as
innate immune signaling, vesicular trafficking and migration have been shown to be regulated by H2O2, but
how cellular membranes allow for specific and privileged signaling by H2O2 remains incompletely understood.
We therefore propose studies that aim to establish general rules and emergent concepts related to H2O2
signals at membranes. Our studies will encompass four major areas of inquiry that seek to address i) How
does plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 influence redox signaling and regulation? ii.) How do H2O2
signals and subsequent regulation of proteins alter essential vesicular trafficking pathways in the cell? iii) How
does H2O2 signaling occur at vesicular membranes? iv.) How does spatial control of cellular H2O2 regulate the
directional migration of cells? To address these questions, we will apply and develop high resolution
quantitative fluorescence imaging to follow the spatial and temporal dynamics of H2O2 signals at membranes,
in combination with proteomic approaches to identify target modified cysteines. Further studies will investigate
how oxidative modifications alter target protein structure, function and localization, constructing a mechanistic
understanding of how H2O2 signals are relayed from cellular membranes. Future studies will build on this
framework to uncover strategies to direct and manipulate H2O2 signals for treatment of human disease.
Integrated to these studies will be the development of novel tools and approaches to study H2O2 signals at
membranes that can be broadly applied for research in this field."

Integrating Volumetric Light-Field with Computational Fluid Dynamics to Study Myocardial
Trabeculation and Function
Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) is a disease of endomyocardial trabeculation or known as
spongy myocardium. NCC carries a high risk of malignant arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and
ventricular dysfunction in association with congenital heart defects or skeletal myopathy. Studies have
linked left ventricular non-compaction with autosomal dominant inherited disorders, and mutations in
Notch pathways are implicated in defective trabeculation and ventricular NCC. Biomechanical force is
intimately connected with mechanotransduction and cardiac morphogenesis. During development, the
myocardium differentiates into an outer compact zone and an inner trabeculated zone. Notch receptor-
ligand interaction induces EphrinB2-Nrg-ErbB2 signaling to initiate trabecular formation. Our in silico
analysis (Alison Marsden, Stanford) revealed elevated oscillatory shear index (OSI) in trabecular
ridges, leading to increased viscous dissipation, which was associated with changes in ventricular
contractile function and remodeling. However, uncoupling myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow
dynamics to elucidate Notch-mediated trabecular organization and subsequent associated changes in
local hemodynamics remains an unmet biomechanical challenge. In this context, we hypothesize that
hemodynamic shear and myocardial contractile forces coordinate trabecular organization needed to
preserve the ventricular structure and contractile efficiency. In combination of laser light-sheet and light-
field for super resolution and volumetric imaging, we simultaneously captured myocardial contraction
and intracardiac flow dynamics. In collaboration with Stanford Cardiac Mechanics, we integrated fluid
structure interaction (FSI) with super resolution imaging to demonstrate 4-D endocardial shear stress in
the trabecular ridges and grooves as possible developmental modulator. To test our hypothesis, we
propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that intracardiac shear stress activates
endocardial Delta-Notch signaling to promote trabecular ridge formation. In Aim 2, we will
demonstrate that ventricular contraction activates myocardial Jagged-Notch signaling to organize
trabecular groove formation. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate that the combination of trabecular ridge
and groove formation leads to optimal local hemodynamics and ventricular energetics. The
integration of advanced imaging, fluid structure interaction, and zebrafish genetics is uniquely suitable
to unveil trabecular organization in relation to kinetic energy dissipation. Our multi-disciplinary approach
provides new biomechanical insights into non-compaction cardiomyopathy with pathophysiological
significance to ventricular remodeling and function."
10795865,"Carbapenems, the once last-resort ß-lactam antibiotics immune to ß-lactamase hydrolysis, are now susceptible to inactivation by the so-called carbapenemases, especially the serine-based Class A ß-lactamase KPC-2 commonly found in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE, listed as an urgent threat by CDC). Carbapenemases also threaten the future clinical utility of new carbapenems currently being developed against L,D-transpeptidases of mycobacteria and others. However, it is poorly understood how KPC-2 is able to hydrolyze nearly all ß-lactam antibiotics and continues to evade newly developed inhibitors, such as avibactam, via resistance mutations. Additionally, Class B metallo-ß-lactamases, represented by NDM-1 and VIM-2, have emerged as another problematic group of carbapenemases frequently observed in clinic, with yet few effective inhibitors. Through structure-based drug discovery, we have identified a series of phosphonate- based inhibitors of KPC-2, with the best compound displaying a binding affinity (Ki) of 20 nM and highly promising cell-based activities. Remarkably, these compounds also demonstrated low M to high nM activities against metallo-carbapenemases NDM-1 and VIM-2. Structural analysis of these inhibitors and others revealed that unique active site features of carbapenemases appear to enhance their ability to bind to small molecules. These properties enable them to hydrolyze a wide range of ß-lactam antibiotics but also make them more prone to inhibition by diverse small molecule chemotypes. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) develop low to sub- nM inhibitors against Class A carbapenemases particularly KPC-2, including dual-activity compounds with high affinity for metallo-carbapenemases as well, using structure-based design and synthesis, in vitro analysis and animal models; 2) apply mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, NMR and MD simulation to probe the active site features, both static and dynamic, that underlie KPC-2’s broad substrate profile and unique carbapenemase activity, as well as to investigate the development of resistance against existing and new inhibitors including our own. These experiments will result in new ß-lactamase inhibitor leads for antibiotic development, while providing a deeper understanding of ß-lactamase catalysis and the evolution of resistance, to help guide future drug discovery."

As underscored by pandemic COVID-19, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses, new and emerging
viruses represent increasing threats to human health, yet their mechanisms of emergence remain poorly
understood, and effective interventions are not available for most. Research on their pathogenesis, ecology,
evolution, epidemiology, emergence mechanisms, diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics remain critical public
health needs. The World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) comprises a
comprehensive, diverse collection of over 8,000 virus strains in 21 families, as well as antisera, antigens,
cDNA clones and other reagents to enable research worldwide. Approximately 400 new virus strains are added
annually, and 1000 viruses and reagents are shipped annually. The WRCEVA also maintains broad expertise
in both novel and traditional approaches to virus identification and characterization, and provides critical
support for emergency outbreak responses as exemplified by the rapid generation and distribution of critical
COVID and Zika reagents. This proposal seeks to continue these WRCEVA activities in support of NIH-funded
and other research on emerging viruses worldwide, through five Specific Aims:
1. Maintain a comprehensive set of emerging viruses, arboviruses and associated reagents to support
 research and surveillance. The virus collection as well as antigens, antibodies, cDNA clones and other
 reagents will be continually enhanced to capitalize on new emergence trends and technologies. Emphasis
 during the first two years will be placed on the development of critical reagents for coronavirus research.
2. Discover, isolate and characterize newly acquired viruses to determine relationships and taxonomic
 assignments, and to assess in vitro and in vivo host range. Clinical and field samples as well as viral
 isolates will be received for identification and characterization, and added to the repository. Critical
 phenotypes of newly discovered viruses and strains will be assessed by using in vitro and in vivo infections.
3. Perform sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of selected virus groups to determine evolutionary
 histories and emergence mechanisms, patterns of spread/infection, and to rapidly determine the
 sources of new outbreaks. Key virus strains will undergo genomic sequencing to generate databases that
 can be exploited for the rapid determination of new outbreak sources, including potential bioterrorism.
4. Determine why yellow fever virus has not caused major urban epidemics in South America for many
 decades, or ever in Asia. Our unique collection of virus strains and arbovirology expertise will be used to
 examine hypotheses related to limitations on urban transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
5. Train scientists in the identification and characterization of emerging viruses. To enhance research
 and surveillance in the U.S. and worldwide, the most efficient way to limit spread of new outbreaks, training
 in virus identification, characterization, and diagnostics will be provided to visiting scientists."

This Academic-Industrial Partnership (AIP) will further the clinical development of fluorescence guided surgery
(FGS) through the utilization of the FDA exploratory Investigational New Drug (eIND) pathway. While recent
advances in both imaging agents and technology for FGS has been impressive, significant limitations remain in
detecting low dose administration of imaging agents and obtaining true molecular contrast between the tumor
and normal surrounding tissues. The basis of this application and the underlying tenet of the proposed AIP is
that a cost-effective, risk-diluted approach to clinical translation of imaging methodologies is needed in order to
realize the promise of FGS. Utilization of our previously developed bench-to-clinic pipeline stands to accelerate
surgical oncology to revolutionize both the procedures that are possible and the surgical outcomes that will result.
In the first funding cycle our AIP implemented a low-cost testing pipeline for ABY-029, a fluorescent epidermal
growth factor receptor-targeted synthetic peptide. We established the necessary protocols to bring ABY-029
from pre-clinical animal models into three Phase 0 clinical trials using the FDA eIND pathway (eIND #122681).
We will build upon our previous success to apply for Investigational New Drug (IND) status of ABY-029 for
economical, investigator-led Phase II testing of detection accuracy in glioma and head and neck cancers. Sim-
ultaneously, we will utilize the pipeline to achieve eIND approval of paired-agent imaging. The proposed AIP
between Dartmouth (Engineering and Medical Schools), Affibody AB, LI-COR, and DoseOptics brings together
4 partners who have the intellectual property (IP), expertise and infrastructure to develop, test and advance
molecular-targeted fluorescent tracers and imaging systems for surgical guidance.
Clinical translation and testing of FGS will be achieved through the completion of the following aims:
Aim 1 - Advance near-microdose ABY-029 FGS for resection of primary high-grade glioma in a Phase 2 trial;
Aim 2 - Adapt FGS system for minimally invasive resection of head and neck cancers for Phase 2 testing; and
Aim 3 - Leverage the Dartmouth fluorescent agent development pipeline to bring quantitative molecular paired-
agent imaging (PAI) to Phase 0 trial using a cocktail of ABY-029 and IRDye 680LT carboxylate (pABY-IR680).
The translational INNOVATION will include advancement of ABY-029 into Phase II clinical trials, first-in-human
implementation of paired-agent imaging for true molecular contrast via the established bench-to-clinic eIND pipe-
line, and the integration of a highly sensitive, multi-channel near infrared surgical camera imaging system capa-
ble of imaging in full surgical lights. The SIGNIFICANCE of this AIP will be to demonstrate improved margin
detection for surgical resection of glioma and head and neck cancers using a low-cost, efficient testing pipeline."
10805525,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 As cells undergo extreme forms of terminal differentiation, they are able to accumulate specific proteins
to exceptionally high levels–hundreds of milligrams per ml in the case of globins and crystallins. At the same
time, almost all other cellular components are eliminated. How cells can carry out such vast programs of
biosynthesis and degradation simultaneously has been almost a complete mystery. We proposed in 1995 that
the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) may play a central role in global proteome remodeling. Using murine
reticulocytes, a uniquely powerful system to study global proteome remodeling, we found that indeed UBE2O, a
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is strongly induced in late erythroid differentiation, mediates the elimination of
ribosomes and myriad other proteins via the proteasome. We proceeded to examine other UPS components
that are strongly induced in erythroid cells, and found that TRIM10 eliminates dynactin, many myosins, actin
crosslinking proteins, the erythroid regulator TMCC2, and COP1 vesicles; TRIM58 eliminates dynein and
centrosomal proteins; the unique ubiquitin-like protein TBCEL specifically dismantles the tubulin cytoskeleton;
and UBE2H, together with the GID complex, eliminates a broad set of mRNA-binding translational regulatory
proteins while also promoting the elimination of many mitochondrial proteins. Thus, these UPS components have
highly distinct specificities, each driving the elimination of different parts of the cell or proteome. This work
uncovers a vast new regulatory pathway that appears to be central to the maturation of the erythrocyte. It also
indicates a remarkable new capacity of the UPS: to effect global and developmentally controlled proteomic
remodeling. In contrast to the above-described proteins, most UPS components disappear during erythroid
maturation; thus, a highly specialized variant of the UPS mediates remodeling. Focusing on TBCEL, TRIM10,
and TRIM58, we will use biochemical reconstitution, crystallography, and hydrogen exchange mass
spectrometry to resolve specific mechanisms of degradation and degradation signals in target proteins. Cellular
studies will focus on the cytoskeleton and on translational control as highlighted by our proteomic data. As the
erythroblast matures into the red blood cell, its radial, microtubule-based cytoskeleton is replaced by an acentric
actin-based network. We will characterize how the cytoskeleton functions during the unusual and to date
uncharacterized transition period that takes place in the reticulocyte. We will then assess the impact of
programmed elimination of tubulin and other cytoskeletal proteins on this cytoskeletal transformation. Although
late erythroid cells are known to be characterized by extensive translational regulation, our findings indicate a
new mechanism by which diverse translational regulators are themselves controlled. We will use our mutants to
determine the impact of UBE2H-dependent ubiquitination on mRNA translation in reticulocytes, using RNA-Seq
and Ribo-Seq in parallel. In summary, we propose that ubiquitin-dependent proteome remodeling is an important
new aspect of the biology of eukaryotic cells, critical for the generation of highly differentiated cell types."
10821350,"Heart failure progression is a complex biological process that is precipitated by the maladaptive myocardial
response to injury, compounded by failure of the adult heart to replace lost or damaged cardiomyocytes.
Conceivably, identifying common pathways that regulate these two seemingly unrelated processes would
profoundly impact therapeutic strategies to prevent, and even reverse heart failure progression. Numerous
observations by members of the proposed consortium and others support the notion that the endogenous
capacity of the neonatal mammalian heart to proliferate fades in the early postnatal life as a switch from
hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes takes place. Members of the proposed consortium and
others have also previously demonstrated that mechanisms linked to activation of immune response may play
a role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, death, healing and even stimulation of new cardiomyocyte generation. The
current proposal brings together several groups with significant expertise in immunology, myocardial
remodeling, hypertrophy and regeneration with the overall goal of determining the role of immune response
signaling in regulation of cardiac growth, healing and regeneration. Indeed, the immune response has taken
center stage in the past several years as a primary determinant of both healthy cardiac aging and healing after
injury, as well as a determinant of chronic disease states when it is inappropriately regulated. Thus, this
Program Project will investigate a frontier and emerging area of scientific investigation involving the intersection
between the immune system and the myocardium. Specifically, studies will examine the role of innate immune
response signals in cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulation, as well as in myocardial remodeling and hypertrophy.
In addition, dedicated studies will examine the role of cGAS-STING expression in cardiomyocytes and in
immune cells in regulation of cardiac growth and regeneration. Finally, studies in the proposed Program Project
will examine the role of macrophage subtypes in mediating myocardial response to cell therapy as well as injury.
The proposed Program Project is well in line with the interest and expertise of the groups in the network and
extends their focus into a highly relevant and poorly explored area of cardiac pathophysiology. The current
proposal creates a new shared focus for all the groups in the Program Project that aims to establish a new
paradigm in the field."

cardiomyocytes. Conceivably, identifying common pathways that regulate these two seemingly
unrelated processes would profoundly impact therapeutic strategies to prevent, and even reverse heart
failure progression. Numerous observations by members of the proposed consortium and others support
the notion that the endogenous capacity of the neonatal mammalian heart to proliferate fades in the
early postnatal life as a switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes takes place.
Members of the proposed consortium and others have also previously demonstrated that mechanisms
linked to activation of the immune response may play a role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, death,
healing and even stimulation of new cardiomyocyte generation. The current proposal brings together
several groups with significant expertise in myocardial remodeling, regeneration and immunology with
the overall goal of determining the role of immune response signaling in regulation of cardiac growth,
healing and regeneration. Indeed, the immune response has taken center stage in the past several
years as a primary determinant of both healthy cardiac aging and healing after injury, as well as a
determinant of chronic disease states when it is inappropriately regulated. Thus, this Program will
investigate a frontier and emerging area of scientific investigation involving the intersection between the
immune system and the myocardium. The Administrative Core (Core A) of the proposed Program
Project will provide critical administrative and logistical services of the 4 Projects as well as the two other
cores, Core B and Core C. Through the highly interrelated series of experiments proposed in our four
Projects, and supported by the activities of an Administrative Core (Core A), Immunology and
Physiology Cores (Cores B, and C), we aim to answer questions that are crucial for understanding the
role of immunity in the regulation of cardiac homeostasis and pathology. Together, these studies will
test a paradigm changing hypothesis that the immune system is a critical regulator of cardiac growth
and repair. The Administrative Core will be housed at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
Division of Cardiology. Core A will be led by Dr. Hesham Sadek and will be tasked with providing PIs
and key personnel with the administrative and logistic support needed to achieve the goals of the project.
Core A will provide research administrative support, fiscal and intellectual property support, facilitate
communications, and provide statistical consultation for the entire Program Project. As such Core A will
play a vital role as the operational manager of the Program Project."

 The mouse is a powerful model organism for dissecting the underlying molecular and
genetic mechanisms leading to heart failure or cellular loss with ischemic injury. The
mouse will be the basis for all gene-disease relationship studies proposed in all 4 Projects
in the proposed Program. Core C will produce models of cardiac injury in a systematic
manner to ensure reproducibility and comparability across all 4 Projects so that results are
not influenced by model variability. Mice will be shipped as needed between Dallas and
Cincinnati for the proposed model production and analyses. The heart disease phenotype
will also be extensively analyzed in Core C, such as structure and functional assessment,
which will also be performed in a controlled and reproducible manner between the 4
projects, Core C will provide mouse models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R),
myocardial infarction injury (MI), cardiac pressure overload induced by transverse aortic
constriction (TAC), and apical resection of the early neonatal mouse heart. For phenotypic
analysis of these mouse models, Core C will perform echocardiography, invasive
hemodynamics using a pressure sensing intraventricular catheter, and cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). All 4 Projects will extensively use Core C, both the surgical
model generation capabilities and the functional assessment capabilities. Highly skilled
core personnel will ensure surgical consistency as well as data integration, uniformity, and
transparency across the 4 Projects. Core C approaches and services are essential for
cardiovascular structure and function analyses and will provide an indispensable
foundation and common linking point"

Use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) among older adults (age ≥65 years) result in preventable
adverse health events, including hospitalization and mortality. Certain individual medications that are classified
as PIMs are associated with greater risk for dementia, demonstrated to act on the central and peripheral nervous
system and block the action of specific neurotransmitters (e.g., anticholinergics block acetylcholine). Registry-
based studies show that PIM use increases over older adulthood for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (AD/RD) and matched healthy controls. However, epidemiology of PIM use over older
adulthood has not been assessed in multi-ethnic community-based cohorts or in response to a lifestyle
intervention. Because PIM use results in avoidable complications, we need to understand epidemiology of PIM
use in response to interventions and in relation to subsequent cognitive complications, respectively. Identifying
whether lifestyle interventions can reduce PIM use and prevent mild cognitive impairment and dementia would
have major clinical and public health implications.
This proposal will leverage data from epidemiological studies and a clinical trial to provide estimates of PIM
prevalence, incidence, and longitudinal change among three large multi-ethnic and geographically diverse study
populations: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, Action for Health in Diabetes Study, and
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. This research will estimate (Aim 1) prevalence of PIM use and factors
associated with PIM use, (Aim 2) longitudinal change in PIM use during older adulthood and in response to an
intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss, and (Aim 3) the association between PIM use and incident
MCI/dementia and brain pathology.
This work is significant and innovative because it will provide estimates of PIM use among multi-ethnic cohorts
and a new research resource for Look AHEAD and MESA investigators (characterization of PIM use). This
proposal will also assess the effect of a lifestyle intervention on longitudinal change in PIM use and will help
disentangle the temporal association between PIM use and AD/RD. We have designed each aim to address a
critical gap in our understanding of the epidemiology of PIM use, and potential for interventions in older adulthood
to reduce AD/RD-related morbidity and mortality due to PIM use. Our team has the research skills, experience,
and resources to address these aims in a rigorous and efficient manner. The findings from this work will provide
empirical evidence for treatment strategies to reduce PIM use and prevent AD/RD, and to assess whether PIM
use is associated with other aging-related conditions."
10810863,"Project Summary: As exemplified by the Haber-Bosch reaction, which sustains half the human
population, and enantioselective hydrogenation, which (beyond resolution of racemates) is the
foremost chemical method used to create chiral pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients,
catalytic hydrogenation has had a greater impact on humanity than any other chemical process.
Prior to our work, the sole example of a “C-C bond forming hydrogenation” was hydroformylation,
which is now the largest application of homogenous metal catalysis. My laboratory has
pioneered a broad, new family of metal-catalyzed carbonyl reductive couplings that exploit
feedstock pronucleophiles in combination with safe, inexpensive feedstock reductants (H2, 2-
PrOH, HCO2H), and related H2-autotransfer processes (ROH = reductant & proelectrophile) that
directly convert lower alcohols to higher alcohols. These transformations bypass stoichiometric
organometallic reagents and the issues of safety, selectivity, and waste associated with their
use, offering a byproduct-free alternative to a range of classical carbonyl or imine additions. In
the proposed funding period, this reactivity pattern will be extended to couplings of α-olefins and
C-X pronucleophiles, the use of amine proelectrophiles, the formation of quaternary
stereocenters and use of base metal catalysts. Our ultimate objective is to develop
environmentally benign methods for the conversion of inexpensive chemical feedstocks to value-
added building blocks for use in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and agrochemical
ingredients."

My laboratory pursues answers to fundamental questions in cell biology. Broadly, we study how self-assembly
of complex macromolecular structures —especially cytoskeletal polymers and networks— creates spatial order
in living cells. To understand how molecular properties govern the architecture and function of living cells, we
perform quantitative studies at multiple size scales: (i) single-molecule and bulk biochemical studies of
cytoskeletal components; (ii) biophysical and microscopical studies of complex cellular structures reconstituted
in vitro; and (iii) cell biological and high-resolution microscopy studies of cytoskeletal systems in living cells.
Our work currently addresses the following topics: (1) function and regulation of actin network motors that
make use of the Arp2/3 complex; (2) pseudopod assembly and amoeboid locomotion; (3) autophagy and
endomembrane movement; (4) nuclear actin assembly and DNA repair; and (5) assembly and function of
cytoskeletal elements in eubacteria and archaea. As part of an international consortium we have also recently
begun work to understand how SARS-CoV2 induces formation of long, branched filopodia in infected host cells
and what function these filopodia play in viral egress and spread."
10815823,"Periodontitis is the 6th most common infection worldwide and an estimated 5 – 20% of the population suffer
from generalized chronic periodontitis. Studies based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(2009-2010) data demonstrated that the incidence of periodontitis is significantly higher in African Americans
(AAs, 58.6%) and Hispanic Americans (HAs, 59.7%) compared to Caucasian Americans (CAs, 42.6%).
Periodontitis may also have systemic health consequences leading to conditions such as cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and preterm birth, all of which are also considered disproportionally affect AAs and HAs.
Microbiome is recently considered to be an important contributor to these health disparity diseases and
conditions. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative bacterium, has been recognized to play a vital role in
the development of dysbiotic microbial communities and is capable of disrupting host-microbial homeostasis
and inducing inflammatory responses in periodontal tissues facilitated by poly-microbes acting in concert. We
recently identified a potential functional motif (SAPP), located at the C-terminal portion of S. cristatus ArcA,
which can bind to surface proteins of P. gingivalis and repress the expression of fimA, mfa1 and rgps in P.
gingivalis. These exciting findings provide the foundation for the proposed studies. Our overall hypothesis is
that the components of the antagonistic communication system between S. cristatus and P. gingivalis can be
developed to identify compounds that repress virulence factor expression and pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.
The objective of this proposal is to dissect SAPP and identify the cognate P. gingivalis receptors. Therefore we
will first characterize and design small peptides derived from SAPP that repress expression of virulence-
associated genes in P. gingivalis. The receptor(s) of P. gingivalis that senses SAPP will then be identified and
characterized. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide fundamental novel information
regarding interspecies antagonism, and could have far-reaching consequences on periodontal health by
leading to discovery of potential pharmaceutical agents to inhibit P. gingivalis colonization and pathogenesis."
10851698,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic alcohol exposure is associated with the development of tolerance to alcohol’s aversive properties, which
serve to limit drinking. In contrast, the response to alcohol’s rewarding properties, which promote drinking, remain
unchanged. The brain undergoes a host of neuroadaptive changes as a result of chronic alcohol exposure but
the neural mechanisms underlying this tolerance are unknown. Impaired signaling in circuits encoding aversion
is a likely candidate mechanism. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is characterized for its involvement
in aversion including signaling the aversive properties of ethanol. The prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) shares important functional similarities with the RMTg including facilitation of aversion learning and
regulating the behavioral response to aversive stimuli. The neighboring infralimbic (IL) subregion of the mPFC
exerts opposing effects to PL mPFC by facilitating extinction of aversive responding. Our work has uncovered a
dense projection from the mPFC to the RMTg that spans both PL and IL subregions. Our findings from
experiments investigating the function mPFC inputs to the RMTg support a role for these circuits in regulating
aversive responding. These data lead us to hypothesize that subregion- and circuit-specific dependence-induced
plasticity in RMTg-projecting mPFC neurons facilitates chronic tolerance to ethanol’s aversive properties. The
aims described in the current proposal will use innovative, circuit-specific strategies to test this hypothesis. Aim
1 will use in vivo fiber photometry to measure changes in calcium signal in RMTg-projecting PL and IL mPFC
inputs during the development of tolerance. Aim 2 will use closed-loop in vivo optogenetics to dissect the effects
of bidirectional manipulation of PL and IL mPFC inputs to the RMTg on measures of chronic tolerance to
ethanol’s aversive properties. Aim 3 will use whole-cell patch-clamp slice electrophysiology and a virally-
mediated intersectional approach to identify dependence-induced changes in synaptic and structural plasticity
underlying tolerance to ethanol’s aversive properties. The results of these studies will provide crucial insight into
the circuit-specific neural mechanisms that contribute to uncontrolled alcohol drinking. In doing so, our findings
have the potential to uncover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder."
10815869,"Project Summary
In this project, we will define epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms that result in increased MUC5B
expression, distal airway epithelial abnormalities, and associated fibroproliferative phenotypes. Idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has a 5-year mortality rate surpassing many cancers. The G-to-T transversion,
rs35705950, is the most potent known risk factor for developing IPF and is located ~ 3 kb upstream of the
MUC5B gene. This -3 kb region regulates MUC5B expression, which is increased in IPF, especially in terminal
bronchiole-like regions. Bronchioles are a primary site of IPF pathogenesis and feature aberrant epithelial
differentiation in disease, promoting local recruitment and activation of fibroblasts. Although rs35705950 and
MUC5B are key players in IPF pathogenesis, rs35705950 alone is not sufficient to cause IPF, and we don’t
fully understand how MUC5B and rs35705950 promote IPF pathogenesis. Our proposal is based on a two- hit
hypothesis that addresses these gaps. We hypothesize that MUC5B overexpression, potentiated by epigenetic
changes, primes the bronchiolar epithelium such that a second injurious hit results in aberrant epigenetic
regulation, detrimental ER stress and fibroblast activation. Three Aims address this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we
will determine molecular control of MUC5B transcription in proximal and distal airway epithelia from unaffected
and IPF subjects. This work extends our preliminary data on -3 kb MUC5B enhancer function, and we will
specifically test whether the pioneer transcription factor, FOXA2, induces chromatin remodeling, enhancer
RNA transcription and MUC5B expression through methods such as ChIP and factor knockdown. In Aim 2 we
will identify epigenetic and transcription factor mechanisms that drive abnormal distal airway epithelial cell
differentiation in relationship to MUC5B expression and genotypes in IPF. Aim 2 is motivated by our data
implicating important roles in IPF for two transcription factors involved in normal airway epithelial differentiation,
EHF and GRHL2. Our methods in Aim 2 will include ATAC-seq, nascent transcript sequencing, knockdown
and ChIP to define mechanistic roles for these factors in IPF, with extension of our findings into human
samples and cells from Muc5b overexpressing mice. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of airway epithelial
epigenetics and MUC5B expression on transcriptional control of ER stress and fibroblast activation in IPF. Aim
3 builds on our data supporting an epigenetic mechanism in detrimental ER stress responses where IPF-
derived cells direct the master ER stress regulator, XBP1(S) to interact with open chromatin at motifs for the
ATF family of transcription factors. We will extend on these findings through applying ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq
to study XBP1(S) genomic occupancy and ATF4 crosstalk in IPF-derived human airway epithelial cells. We will
also study fibroblast epigenetics in relationship to airway epithelial abnormalities in IPF. Taken together, these
studies will advance our molecular understanding of transcriptional control in IPF pathogenesis and identify
new targets for restoring distal airway epithelial function in this devastating disease."
10815873,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand how enhanced expression of MUC5B
contributes to epithelial cell injury and lung fibrosis. Over the past decade, we have found that: 1) a gain-
of-function MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 is the dominant risk factor for the development of IPF which
has been validated by multiple independent investigators; 2) among patients with IPF, MUC5B is misexpressed
in bronchioles and alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells; 3) IPF epithelia from distal airways (<2 mm airway
caliber) have a unique migratory, pro-fibrotic phenotype in vitro that is replicated ex vivo in mice exposed to
bleomycin; and 4) MUC5B appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of IPF, and the concentration of Muc5b
is directly related to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Despite these findings, we don’t fully understand
how excess MUC5B in the distal lung is mechanistically linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Our
preliminary findings combined with the established association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
both IPF and experimental models of lung fibrosis, and the recent observation that XBP1(S) appears to be
necessary and sufficient for MUC5B expression induced by the MUC5B promoter variant, suggest that while
overexpression of MUC5B places individuals at risk of developing IPF by causing persistent homeostatic ER
stress of bronchiolar epithelia, fibroblast recruitment and pro-fibrotic programming requires second hits (such as
aging, tobacco smoke, and/or inflammation) resulting in detrimental ER stress of bronchiolar epithelia and
recruitment and activation of fibroblasts. Accordingly, we hypothesize that MUC5B overexpression in
bronchiolar epithelia causes homeostatic ER stress that primes responses to subsequent injury, thereby
leading to persistent activation of detrimental ER stress responses that cause epithelial dysfunction
during injury/repair and lead to fibroblast activation. In Aim 1, we will characterize the airway epithelial cell
populations most susceptible to variant-induced MUC5B overexpression and ER stress and map these
expression changes to the heterogeneity of lung fibrosis in IPF and the MUC5B promoter variant, examining the
relationship between ER stress, UPR, autophagy, cell senescence, and apoptosis. In Aim 2, we will use in vitro
experimental models to test the role of MUC5B and ER stress on the biophysical properties of airway epithelia
and epithelial-driven activation of fibroblasts. In Aim 3, we will use Muc5b and Xbp1(S) overexpression models,
and pharmacologic and genetic IRE1 pathway inhibition approaches at baseline (first hit) and in response to
aging and/or bleomycin (second hits) to investigate the relationship between Muc5b, ER stress, and lung fibrosis.
This research will address a crucial question about the pathobiology of IPF: How does enhanced expression of
MUC5B promote epithelial injury and lung fibrosis?"
10815877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of Project 3 is to understand how increased misexpression of MUC5B in distal airways leads to
honeycomb cyst formation, fibroblast accumulation, pro-fibrotic programming and ultimately fibrosis in response
to distal airway and alveolar epithelial injury. Through a combination of in vivo studies in mouse models and in
vitro studies with human lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts, Project 3 seeks to fill this knowledge gap by testing
the hypothesis that MUC5B misexpression and persistent ER stress in distal airway epithelial cells creates
susceptibility to apoptosis in both alveolar epithelial cells and distal airway epithelial cells leading to
fibrosis and honeycomb cyst formation, respectively. We will address mechanistic questions about: (i) how
MUC5B misexpression by distal airway epithelial cells creates vulnerability to apoptosis induction leading to
fibroblast accumulation, pro-fibrotic programming, fibrosis and honeycomb cyst formation, (ii) the relative role(s)
of alveolar and distal airway epithelial cell apoptosis in the development of fibrosis and honeycomb cysts, and
(iii) from a remedial perspective, if prevention of epithelial cell apoptosis mitigates the development of pulmonary
fibrosis and honeycomb cyst formation. While much has been learned about the role of alveolar epithelial cell
apoptosis in the development of fibrosis, most of these studies were conducted prior to the discovery of increased
IPF susceptibility conferred by MUC5B misexpression. Project 3 seeks to address this knowledge gap. Aim 1
will test the hypothesis that alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, in the context of increased distal airway Muc5b
misexpression, leads to fibrosis, but not honeycomb cyst formation in mice. This hypothesis will be tested using
an alveolar epithelial cell ablation strategy in the context of Muc5b misexpression in distal airway epithelial cells
to define the importance of alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis in the development of fibrosis. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that induction of distal airway epithelial cell apoptosis in the context of increased distal airway Muc5b
misexpression promotes honeycomb cyst formation in mice. This hypothesis with be tested using a distal airway
epithelial cell ablation strategy. Aim 2 will also provide insight into the question of whether distal airway epithelial
cell apoptosis and honeycomb cyst formation in the context of Muc5b misexpression indirectly leads to alveolar
replacement and fibrosis. Lastly, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that prevention of alveolar and distal airway
epithelial cell apoptosis even in the context of increased distal airway Muc5b misexpression will prevent
persistent fibrosis and honeycomb cyst formation. While increased MUC5B expression in distal airways is a risk
factor for the development of fibrosis and honeycomb cysts in IPF patients, little is known about the fundamental
mechanisms that connect these events. Though extensive integration with Projects 1 and 2 and full utilization
of the Core resources, completion of the proposed studies will innovate understanding of these understudied
questions and provide novel insights into the unresolved question of how MUC5B contributes to the development
of interstitial fibrosis and honeycomb cysts in the vulnerable lung."

 Untreated anxiety and depression are exceedingly common in people living with HIV (PLWH) in the rural
South, a population critically affected by the HIV epidemic. Addressing mental health is essential to improving
the disparate HIV burden in this population. Yet outside of routine clinical care, few interventions target mental
health in PLWH in the rural South. Mobile health technology (mHealth) and community health worker (CHW)-
delivered care are two intervention models that address barriers unique to rural, underserved, populations.
 Dr. Manavalan is an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at the
University of Florida. She seeks a K23 award to gain skills, experience and preliminary data needed to become
an independent physician-scientist focused on developing and implementing novel and scalable interventions in
underserved communities that will contribute to Ending the HIV Epidemic. Through the training and research
proposal outlined in this award, Dr. Manavalan will bridge the fields of HIV and mental health by incorporating
evidence-based interventions effective in other settings into existing medical systems in Florida.
 In this 4-year study Dr. Manavalan will adapt an evidence-based CHW-delivered counseling intervention for
delivery through an existing mHealth application, as a strategy to reduce anxiety and depression and maximize
viral suppression in PLWH in the rural South. In Aim 1, she will conduct robust qualitative research with diverse
key stakeholders, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to discern
perspectives to inform adaption and implementation of the intervention. Next, in Aim 2, she will assemble a
Design Consultation Team composed of 12 members from key stakeholder groups (PLWH from the target
population, HIV and mental health providers, and mHealth and behavioral scientists) to assist in adapting CHW-
delivered counseling for mHealth delivery, tailored to a rural population. Adaption of the intervention will occur
iteratively, be informed from data from Aim 1 and will be guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework. Lastly, in Aim 3,
she will pilot the adapted intervention with a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial and assess
implementation outcomes (reach, adoptability, implementation, maintenance) and preliminary effectiveness
outcomes (viral suppression, HIV care retention, ART adherence, and anxiety and depression symptoms) using
the RE-AIM model.
 The proposed program will enable Dr. Manavalan to gain expertise in 1) adaption and evaluation of
behavioral interventions, 2) mHealth science, and 3) implementation science and hybrid trial design through
mentorship with leading experts, didactic coursework, professional development programs, and application of
research. This study will lay the groundwork for a fully powered R01 trial to evaluate implementation and
effectiveness of the adapted intervention in underserved communities throughout the state of Florida."

Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal disease. Epigenetic dysregulation, including
overexpression of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) drives treatment resistance, and EZH2 inhibitors are
in clinical trials. Beyond its canonical role as a member of the PRC2 complex as a transcriptional repressor, we
previously identified a non-canonical role of EZH2 in activating AR signaling, as well as in driving lineage
plasticity and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Current data suggests that single agent activity may be limited
and that combination strategies should be pursued. We recently discovered a novel interaction between EZH2
and DNA repair processes and a synergy between EZH2 and PARP inhibition in prostate cancer. We
hypothesize that EZH2 drives downstream molecular programs through canonical and non-canonical
mechanisms, and that these downstream effects are context dependent. Combination therapy with EZH2 and
PARP inhibition will therefore have differential biologic impact in CRPC based on the underlying genomic,
epigenomic, and phenotypic context. We will elucidate the mechanisms by which EZH2 regulates DNA repair
and define how DNA repair pathways impact EZH2 drug sensitivity. We will evaluate the biologic and clinical
impact of EZH2 and PARP inhibition across the heterogeneous spectrum of CRPC through extensive preclinical
and clinical studies. We will conduct a first-in-field, investigator-initiated clinical trial of EZH2i (tazemetostat) plus
PARPi (talazoparib) with extensive translational correlates. Results from this project will provide the basis for a

providing human tissues and analytical capabilities to all three projects to enhance translatability
of mouse studies proposed in P1–P3 to clinical practice in humans. In parallel, Core 2 will
provide lipoprotein, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses currently not provided by our institutional
Metabolomics Core. The cardiovascular research community has shown many important
correlations between clinical outcomes and the plasma levels of atherogenic particles of
different densities, as determined by ultracentrifugation. More detailed analyses are now
uncovering additional risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) within these particles, such as the
content of apoC3 and ceramides. For this PPG, Core 2 will provide a more granular analysis of
lipoproteins isolated by centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography through both directed
and unbiased lipidomic and proteomic analyses of these particles. In addition, clinical samples
(sera, liver, adipose) obtained by the core director will be provided to investigators in all three
projects. These services will avoid the need for PPG investigators to maintain the required
instrumentation in their own laboratories or use expensive commercial services. By centralizing
and standardizing procedures, Core 2 provides a common set of analytical tools to provide a
unified understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in pathophysiologic processes of
atherosclerosis, macrophage biology, regulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and obesity. By
complementing and integrating with the service provided by Core 1, Core 2 staff also provide
bioinformatics support to analyze and interpret proteomic and lipidomic data sets, making Core
2 capabilities available to PPG investigators with little background or expertise in these
analytical technologies. A key long-term goal is to integrate quantitative analyses of lipidomic
data with functional studies to provide a systems biology view of diabetes-related cardiovascular
disease. Core 2 will also develop new analytical methods tailored to specific research objectives
of PPG investigators. Specifically, we will obtain and use standards to quantify and discover
candidate lipids whose role in atherosclerosis is being investigated. These methods will be
extensively used by PPG investigators. Core 2 will offer these services with optimal efficiency
and cost-effectiveness, avoiding the need for individuals to pursue such analyses outside the
PPG."
10834205,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1: High blood levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins (apoB-Lps) are risk factors
for cardiovascular diseases. ApoB-Lp production requires microsomal triglyceride (TG) transfer protein (MTP).
However, MTP’s role in adipose tissue, which does not produce apoB-Lps, is unknown. Fat storage-inducing
transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2) is another TG-binding protein that is involved in lipid droplet (LD) formation in
adipose tissue. While MTP functions in lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), FIT2 assists in the budding
of LDs from the ER membrane towards cytosol. We hypothesize that these two TG binding proteins
perform different functions that affect adipocyte biology, hepatic lipid metabolism, and
atherosclerosis. We showed that adipose-specific MTP deficient (A-Mttp−/−) mice are resistant to diet-
induced obesity, hepatosteatosis and atherosclerosis, but adipose FIT2 deficiency causes hepatosteatosis
and inflammation. These contrasting phenotypes compel us to ask if MTP deficiency can ameliorate
pathologies associated with FIT2 deficiency.
Aim 1.1: Role of adipose MTP in hypertriglyceridemia, hepatosteatosis, and atherosclerosis. We
showed that adipose MTP inhibits adipose TG lipase (ATGL). We will: 1) ask if adipose MTP also modulates
other lipases beyond ATGL; 2) work with P2 and P3 to elucidate mechanisms for hypertriglyceridemia and
reduced hepatosteatosis; and 3) collaborate with C1–C3 to explain why atherosclerosis is lower in A-Mttp−/−
mice. These studies will uncover how MTP promotes adipose TG storage and obesity. We propose that
inhibiting adipose-specific MTP function will reduce obesity and atherosclerosis.
Aim 1.2: Role of MTP and FIT2 in adipose biology, hepatosteatosis, and atherosclerosis. Given the
distinct roles and sites of action of MTP and FIT2 within adipocytes, we will study the effect of adipose-specific
MTP and FIT2 deficiencies on whole-body metabolism, adipose lipolysis, and atherosclerosis, and ask if MTP
deficiency ameliorates FIT2-associated pathology with help from C1–C3 and expertise from P2 and P3.
Our studies will: 1) provide novel information on the roles of adipose MTP and FIT2 in adipose, liver, and
vascular biology; 2) generate novel mouse models; 3) explain roles of MTP and FIT2 in metabolism, TG
hydrolysis, and FA secretion and oxidation; and 4) define how adipose–liver crosstalk controls obesity,
hypertriglyceridemia, hepatosteatosis, and atherosclerosis. Elucidating the mechanisms of apoB-Lps
production depends on collaboration with P2. We will then work with P3 to: 1) study intravascular catabolism of
apoB-Lps produced by adipose–specific MTP- and FIT2-deficient mice, 2) monitor apoB-Lp uptake by
endothelial cells, and 3) elucidate pro- or anti-inflammatory responses in adipocytes and macrophages.
Bioinformatics analyses of RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq (by C1), Lp characterization (by C2), and
atherosclerosis studies (by C3) will yield novel insights into how adipose-specific proteins regulate metabolism."
10834206,"The global hypothesis underlying this PPG application is that crosstalk between adipose, liver, and intravascular
lipolysis regulates the biogenesis of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins, most notably VLDLs. Project 2
(P2) focuses on mechanisms that control the generation of apoB/VLDL in liver cells. Prior work from the PI and
Co-I, which has resulted in 14 publications, established that a major mechanism controlling circulating
apoB/VLDL is the regulated degradation of apoB in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This metabolically
orchestrated event requires the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which was named and first
elucidated by the Co-I. Under lipid-poor conditions, the ERAD of apoB begins with its selection by molecular
chaperones, which is followed by apoB ubiquitinylation and delivery to the cytoplasmic proteasome. In contrast,
when neutral lipids (primarily triacylglycerols) are in excess, apoB is co-translationally lipidated by MTP, and the
nascent apoB/VLDL particles are expanded by lipids sourced from ER resident lipid droplets (LDs), and the re-
modelled apoB/VLDL particle is packaged into COPII vesicles for delivery to the Golgi and then into circulation.
In contrast, the events that regulate the number and composition of lipids assembled with apoB—as well as the
packaging of engorged, lipid-rich apoB/VLDL particles into COPII vesicles—are poorly characterized. To these
ends, results generated by the PI and his colleagues indicate that two factors, ER-resident proteins KLHL12 and
FIT2, play a significant role in controlling lipid assembly onto apoB and the encapsulation of apoB/VLDL into
COPII vesicles in vitro and in vivo. These recently acquired data support several new hypotheses: First, that
KLHL12 resides at apoB exit sites on the ER that include COPII components, and second that the inefficient
integration of apoB into COPII vesicles selects the protein for the recently characterized ER-phagy pathway,
which was also elucidated by the Co-I. A characterization of a new liver-specific KLHL12 knockout mouse will
be used to define the role of KLHL12 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis. In turn, other recently
acquired preliminary data indicate that FIT2 deficiency increases ER membrane lipid content along with the
generation of lipid-depleted apoB/VLDLs. Based on the function of FIT2 in forming cytosolic LDs, these data
underscore another novel hypothesis, that FIT2 delivers LDs into the ER, where they are then integrated into
pre-apoB/VLDL particles in either an MTP-dependent or independent manner. A new liver-specific FIT2 knockout
mouse will concomitantly allow for a study of the links between FIT2 and fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis,
and also atherosclerosis (because of FIT2 regulation of apoB/VLDL lipid content and composition). Broadly, the
Specific Aims of this application are: (1) To define the mechanisms underlying KLHL12-dependent regulation of
lipid-rich apoB/VLDL encapsulation into hepatic ER-derived, Golgi-directed transport vesicles, and (2) To define
the impact of FIT2 on lipid loading of apoB/VLDL particles and their atherogenicity, both of which require critical
collaborations with P1, P3, and Core facilities."

Protein Production and Chemical Biology. The overall goal of this P01 proposal is to elucidate the biological
mechanisms of calcification and their potential role in the onset and etiology of age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The proposed projects will investigate calcification at the
molecular, cellular and organismal levels to build a comprehensive view of the participants that are responsible
for this aging-related phenomenon. Central to all these efforts will be the availability of pure and homogenous
protein reagents with defined properties and modifications that can be manipulated in the various assays and
experiments proposed in the projects. The goal of this Core will be to design and prepare these reagents, with
a particular focus on the calcification-associated proteins vitronectin (Vn), Tau and amyloid β (Aβ). The Core
will also aim to develop enhanced tools for the production of modified proteins for structural and imaging
studies. More specifically, the Core will work towards the following goals: 1) Production of Vn, Tau, and Aβ
constructs for structural, biochemical, biophysical and cellular analysis as necessary for all projects in the
proposal; 2) Development of intein-based tools for segmental isotopic labeling of proteins for nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) studies as described in Project 1; and 3) Preparation of fluorescently labeled proteins for
biophysical assays and sensor development for all projects. In addition to serving the projects described in this
proposal, we expect that the protocols and reagents developed by the Core will be valuable tools for chemical
and cell biologists, biophysicists and structural biologists studying a wide range of biological problems in health
and disease."

A major component of Phase III CoBRE funding for the Center for Cancer Biology Research (CCBR) is funding
of a Pilot Grant Program. The Pilot Grant Program's mission is to promote innovative and impactful cancer
research in the Midwest. The CCBR's on-going Pilot Grant Program has been tremendously successful in
funding projects that ultimately contributed to publications in peer-reviewed journals as well as grant funding
from the National Institutes of Health as well as foundations. A great majority of Pilot Grant awardees utilize the
CCBR's Scientific Cores. As these investigators obtain larger funding sources, they continue to rely on the
CCBR's Cores for generating needed data. Thus, the ultimate success of the Pilot Grant Program is a clear
investment in the CCBR and its Scientific Cores. Included within the Pilot Grant Program will be a Voucher
Program which will provide funds for Core usage. We expect this program to be highly successful as the CCBR's
Scientific Cores are well known in the region for their quality work and quick turnaround time. The Voucher
program will provide the ability for investigators to utilize the Scientific Cores, providing a means for obtaining
data that will ultimately contribute to publications and extramural funding. In these ways, the Pilot Grant program
will significantly contribute to the self-sustainability of the Scientific Cores. Moreover, many Pilot Grants stem
from collaborations between CCBR PIs and investigators from other centers or institutions. Thus, the Pilot Grant
Program will continue to expand the CCBR itself, as well."
10850999,"PROJECT 1 – SUMMARY
Sex is an understudied biological variable with significant influence on immune function, including in the context
of cancer. However, the immunological mechanisms underlying the sex bias seen in cancers from non-
reproductive organs, such as bladder cancer (BC), remain elusive. Male bias in BC incidence persists after
adjustment for other known risk factors suggesting a fundamental biological basis for this sexual dimorphism.
Objective: To define the molecular mechanisms by which androgens, AR target genes, and sex chromosome-
encoded epigenetic modifiers contribute to sex differences in CD8+ T cell exhaustion in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). Impact: Our study will uncover an immunological basis and mechanism by which
CD8+ T cell exhaustion contributes to sex bias in BC, with implications for improving ICB approaches for all
cancer via three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the role of AR-TCF1 and AR-TOX in CD8+ T cell exhaustion
and tumor control. The molecular mechanisms by which androgens influence T cells and contribute to cancer
progression are unclear. Male CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) preferentially adopt a TCF1+ PE state
due to direct activation of Tcf7 by AR. Hypothesis. Androgen signaling establishes a stable TCF1-driven
transcriptional network in CD8+ T cells that favors exhaustion, through the modulation of TOX, another critical
transcription factor (TF) that promotes T cell exhaustion. Aim 2: Determine the role of AR-ZFP148 in T cell
effector differentiation. TF ZFP148 regulates cell proliferation and survival in non-immune cell types but has
not been studied in T cell biology. Single-cell RNA-seq analyses demonstrated male-biased Zfp148 expression
and regulatory activity in PE CD8+ T cells stimulated by AR. T cell receptor (TCR) engagement and chronic
exhaustion induced Zfp148 expression in CD8+ T cells, and its deletion led to better effector function in vitro. The
in vivo persistence of Zfp148 null T cells was compromised. Hypothesis. AR-regulated ZFP148 can suppress
CD8+ T cell effector function and contributes to male-biased BC. Aim 3: Investigate the role of AR and
epigenetic modifiers in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and tumor response to immunotherapy. The impact of sex
chromosome-encoded epigenetic modifiers in BC – including KDM5D, UTY, and KDM6A – on immunity
especially in the CD8+ compartment is a major gap in the field. In collaboration with Project 2, we found that loss
of the Y chromosome (LOY) (especially the genes Kdm5d and Uty) contributes to CD8+ T cell exhaustion in BC.
Hypothesis. Sex hormones and sex chromosome-encoded epigenetic modifiers contribute to CD8+ T cell
exhaustion and BC sensitivity to ICB."
10851003,"PROJECT 2 – SUMMARY
Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is associated with increased risk of cancer development and death in men
with several cancer types. In bladder cancer (BC), a tobacco related malignancy, LOY is seen in ~30% of tumors,
yet the biological relevance of this is unknown. Here we address this Knowledge Gap with the Objective to
define the molecular mechanisms responsible for LOY driven growth and progression and have Impact by
translating these into effective interventions for bladder and other cancer types. Preliminary Data: We examined
TCGA BC RNAseq dataset using an LOY gene signature we developed, and found low signature scores
associated with reduced patient survival following surgery. To determine if LOY drives BC growth, we developed
lineage related male murine cell lines with (Y+) or w/o (Y-) Y chromosome. Y- tumors grew faster than Y+ tumors
in immunocompetent mice and cytometric profiling found the former to have increased immunosuppressive
tumor-associated macrophages, CD8+ T cells with exhausted phenotype while latter had increased NK cells. In
mice (Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/-) that are devoid of T, B and NK cells, Y+ and Y- tumors grew similarly. Transcriptional profiling
found four Y chromosome genes differentially expressed in these tumor types, with chromatin organization genes
Uty and Kdm5d being the only ones whose expression stratified outcome in TCGA BC patients. Thus, we
genetically deleted these genes in Y+ cells and found enhanced tumor growth only in immunocompetent mice
while their overexpression in Y- cells reduced their growth. Hence, we test the Hypothesis that Uty and Kdm5d
loss enhance BC growth and progression via creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in
three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we determine role of Uty and Kdm5d in tumor development and progression
using full and urothelial specific conditional Kdm5d or Uty null mice be exposed to the chemical carcinogen BBN.
With Project 3 we test the hypothesis that Uty and its X chromosome paralog Utx (aka, Kdm6a) have
independent suppressive effects on BC formation and progression by crossing full and urothelial specific
conditional Uty and Utx null mice and exposing them to BBN. In Aim 2 we define how Kdm5d and Uty suppress
BC and the role of the immune system in this process using defined LOF functional mutants to define the regions
on these proteins responsible for tumor growth suppression. With Project 1, we use spatial proteomics to
examine immunological infiltrates in relation to mutant and WT Kdm5d and Uty cancer cell expression and
various knockout mice or antibody depletion strategy to define which cellular components of the immune system
drive tumor growth differences. In Aim 3 we examine ANPEP, the most upregulated gene in Y- tumors that is
also a poor prognostic in BC patients and druggable target, as a candidate autosomal effector gene driving Y-
tumor growth. We found Y- tumors are more responsive than Y+ tumors to anti-PD-1 and ANPEP depletion in Y-
cells made tumors more sensitive to anti-PD-1. Here we will examine the impact of ANPEP deletion or
pharmacologic inhibition on the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy."
10850994,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Five-year survival rate of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) still remains at a dismal 10%. This poor
outcome is attributed to PDAC’s complex tumor microenvironment (TME) containing a desmoplastic stroma,
which consists of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and a dense extracellular matrix (ECM). This stroma
affects proliferation, invasion and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). Unexpectedly, the ablation
of CAFs or targeting of certain ECM proteins in the stroma led to changes that actually accelerated tumor growth
and impaired treatment outcome. To address this challenge, we are pursuing targets that selectively kill PCCs
rather than CAFs. Redox effector factor-1 (Ref-1) is upstream of several key signaling pathways as a regulator
of transcription factors (TFs). Blockade of Ref-1 redox function with our first-generation inhibitor blocks the
activation of key TFs including HIF-1α, NFkB, and AP-1, all of which are implicated in growth and metastasis
signaling in the tumor. However more potent second-generation compounds are necessary to effectively treat
PDAC. We recently synthesized new analogs and obtained data showing that these are more potent with a
significant decrease in tumor cell survival with minimal changes in CAF survival. This selective cancer cell killing
is a novel characteristic of our new analogs, as gemcitabine kills both PCCs and CAFs. The underlying
mechanism and therapeutic efficacy of these compounds are the focus of this proposal. Our overarching goal
is to evaluate second-generation Ref-1 inhibitors for treatment of PDAC by comparing the mechanisms of Ref-1
inhibition in PCCs and CAFs. Our hypothesis is that through inhibition of Ref-1, multiple cancer-associated
pathways are simultaneously and effectively targeted leading to suppression of survival signaling in PCCs while
sparing the CAFs. The heterogeneity and complexity of PDAC poses a significant challenge in screening and
evaluating the efficacy of new compounds on tumors and on stromal components. To overcome these technical
challenges and ultimately lead to new treatments, we will perform mechanistic screening of Ref-1 inhibitors using
newly developed in vitro tumor models based on patient-derived PCCs and CAFs - 1) 3D co-culture spheroids
for screening and tumor-stroma interaction; and 2) a microfluidic tumor-microenvironment-on-chip (T-MOC)
model for mechanistic evaluation. Findings using these novel in vitro systems will be validated with orthotopic
PDAC models. Specific aims are: Aim 1. Investigate the selectivity of Ref-1 signaling and the effects of its
inhibition in PCCs and CAFs using T-MOC models; Aim 2. Characterize the mechanism of Ref-1 inhibition for
second-generation compounds; and Aim 3. Validate the efficacy and pharmacodynamic profiles of Ref-1 analogs
in orthotopic PDAC models. The aims of this proposal will provide invaluable information regarding both the
effectiveness of new Ref-1 analogs in sophisticated in vivo and in vitro PDAC models and validate our in vitro
co-culture models for novel target and compound screening in a cancer that is in need of therapeutic options."

mentoring underrepresented minority investigators through partnerships with local institutions and by leveraging
training programs at UMMC; 4) To enhance collaborations and interactions among established and junior
investigators from multiple disciplines in cardiorenal and metabolic diseases at UMMC, other IDeA supported
programs, and external partners. These interactions will leverage resources provided by UMMC and other IDeA
programs; 5) To further expand the number of highly productive, extramurally funded cardiorenal and metabolic
disease researchers at UMMC by leveraging institutional resources to recruit additional new faculty with
expertise in clinical and translational research, and in areas where there are gaps in CMDCR expertise. The
CMDRC has been a major driver for marked expansion of cardiorenal and metabolic diseases research in

The goal of this training program is to provide the very best training for its predoctoral trainees so that they become
successful and independent leaders in the field of cancer research. The program accomplishes this goal by
providing each trainee with a broad and comprehensive curriculum, a vast array of educational resources such as
seminars, lectures, conferences and workshops specifically geared toward the biology of cancer, a faculty
comprising 49 exceptional preceptors with extensive experience in cancer research mentoring, and an unparalleled
research environment. The success of the training program is demonstrated by its track record of attracting
outstanding and talented predoctoral candidates to Stanford University and placing graduates of the program in
high-profile competitive cancer research positions in academia, industry, and medicine. During the next 5-year
period, there will be a number of new initiatives. The program will focus on leveraging a variety of cutting-edge
technologies pioneered by T32 faculty at Stanford to better understand cancer development and to help develop
improved cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. The strong technology emphasis of the program is a key strength
that will promote a truly multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, enabling collaborations between individuals
in diverse fields such as systems biology, functional genomics, epigenetics, immuno-oncology, and cancer stem
cell biology. In addition, the research conducted by T32 preceptors has a significant clinical focus, with the goal of
ultimately improving cancer care. Our curriculum, which we have designed to provide trainees with a solid core of
cancer biology coursework while allowing flexibility in electives to match individual needs in areas of specialization
(e.g., computational biology), will now also include technology-oriented coursework. We have also introduced a
clinical course to expose students to the translational side of cancer biology as well as “T32 chats” to teach students
about translational cancer biology and pitfalls associated with various technologies. We are taking various measures
to increase diversity in the program, such as through the Social Justice Working Group. We are promoting career
development by providing leadership opportunities for students, access to teaching opportunities, and career
workshops with alumni to give exposure to different potential career options. To ensure optimal mentors, we will
also have a new rigorous selection process for T32 preceptors. To ensure the most robust training program possible,
we consult with internal and external advisory committees comprising highly accomplished scientists at Stanford
and peer institutions. These collective experiences will provide T32 trainees with a strong foundation in cancer

The basis of molecular epidemiologic research lies in the combination of biospecimens and linked subject data.
Over the past two phases of our COBRE Center for Molecular Epidemiology, we have created a unique
Biorepository and Biorespecimen Resource Facility Core with a state-of-the-art and internationally competitive
infrastructure incorporating advanced robotic and bioinformatic systems. Careful handling of biologic samples
with well-integrated de-identified specimen coding, tracking, and data systems are essential for applying
cutting-edge technologies to rapidly advance our understanding of the molecular basis of complex disease
interactions. The Core has handled over 400,000 diverse samples, created over 270,000 aliquots, and
assembled and distributed over 50,000 specimen sets to specialized laboratories. Reflecting the high value of
the Core to the insitutional research mission, the Biospecimen Resource Facility – containing over 615,000
samples – expanded into a larger, on-site, and newly renovated space with modernized security and back-up
systems for long-term biospecimen storage. An advanced laboratory information management and
biospecimen tracking system has been implemented, and our automated equipment has been upgraded for
even higher throughput sample processing with flexible configuration to assimilate future technological
advancements. The wealth of experience, optimized protocols, and efficient systems management approaches
in the Biorepository Core allow the support of a broad range of downstream analyses including novel chemical
assays, genome wide analyses, metabolomics, and metagenomics. The Core has continued to expand its
ability to accommodate diverse specimen types and applications including processing, archiving, and isolations
for single cell genomics applications. In Phase III, we will: expand our biorepository services (Aim 1); grow our
user base by creating and disseminating materials about our offerings (Aim 2); and extend and adapt our array
of services for the wider research community, while continuously evaluating our performance and repertoire of
services and developing a strategic plan to achieve long-term sustainability (Aim 3). By providing a centralized

10845491,"SUMMARY
 Asthma is a debilitating disease of airway inflammation with increasing worldwide occurrence. With higher
incidence in females, asthma is exacerbated by obesity and metabolic disease. Underlying asthma is activation
of innate immune and T cells that drive inflammation. Airway inflammation in severe asthma is caused in part by
an imbalance between effector CD4 T cells (including Th2 and Th17) and suppressive regulatory (Treg) T cells.
This imbalance is particularly heightened in obese females and leads to increased eosinophils and/or neutrophils
in the airway, increased airway hyperresponsiveness, and increased mucus production. It is now clear that T cell
metabolism plays a critical role to regulate immune function and the distinct metabolic programs of each T cell
subset can influence inflammation and play roles in asthma. In addition to a requirement of T cells for glycolysis,
our data show that glutamine metabolism plays a key role to support inflammatory T cells in asthma.
Metabolomics data from bronchoalveolar fluid and mass cytometry of T cells from donors with severe asthma
showed markers of elevated glutaminolysis. While IL17 producing cells both in vitro and from lungs had the
highest expression of metabolic markers, both Th17 and Th2 cells relied on glutamine for differentiation and
cytokine production. Glutamine metabolism is regulated through uptake by the transporter ASCT2 and
Glutaminase (GLS)-dependent conversion to glutamate and α-ketoglutarate that supports mitochondrial electron
transport and regulates epigenetic marks that control chromatin and gene expression. We have now shown
through inhibition, gene targeting, and in vivo primary T cell CRISPR screening in lung inflammation that ASCT2
and GLS are essential for Th17 and Th2 cells. These genes are dispensable for Treg and blocking glutamine
uptake can instead enhance Treg differentiation. Importantly, we also show in an animal model that high fat diet
fed female mice have selectively increased frequencies of Th17 cells. This effect is sex-specific, as high fat diet
fed female, but not male, mice developed increased IL17 production and we show that the Estrogen Receptor
(ERα) plays a key role in females to elevate CD4 T cell glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. We hypothesize
that airway allergen exposure and inflammatory cytokines induce T cell glutamine metabolism, driving Th2 and
Th17 cells that contribute to asthma incidence and severity in obese females. To test this hypothesis, we will:
(1) Determine the role and mechanism of GLS and ASCT2-dependent glutamine metabolism to regulate the
balance of Th2, Th17 and Treg cells in a mixed model of allergic airway inflammation and (2) Test if obesity-
induced exacerbation of asthma severity in females is dependent on enhanced T cell glutamine metabolism in
animal models and from peripheral blood and excised lungs of healthy and severe asthma normal weight or
obese donors. These studies will establish metabolic mechanisms and if inhibiting glutamine uptake or
metabolism through ASCT2 or GLS can shift the balance of Th17 and Th2 cells to instead favor Treg and protect
against asthma to help alleviate this health disparity observed in females with metabolic disease."
10837018,"SUMMARY
Field cancerization is a major clinical condition resulting from combined keratinocyte and dermal fibroblast
alterations. Identification of regulatory molecules to target alterations of both cell types is of substantial interest.
We propose that the nuclear kinase ULK3 is one such a molecule, which we previously studied for its role in
fibroblasts. Here we will pursue the following aims: (1) We will test the hypothesis that ULK3 impinges on key
transcription regulatory networks determining keratinocyte self-renewal and oncogenic potential. ULK3 is up-
regulated in keratinocyte-derived skin and head/neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCCs) and silencing of the
gene suppresses proliferative and tumorigenic potential of both human keratinocytes (HKCs) and SCC cells. We
will explore the interplay between ULK3 and the p63 and GLI transcription networks in growth/differentiation of
these cells and their oncogenicity, in orthotopic models of skin cancer expansion. 2) We will test the hypothesis
that ULK3 functions at the intersection between the arginine methylome and chromatin organization. Arginine
methylation is a little investigated mode of chromatin regulation in SCCs development. We have found that ULK3
associates with the arginine methylases PRMT1 and PRMT5 (PRMTs) and that ULK3 loss in SCC cells results
in down-modulation of di-methylated forms of Histone 4 (H4R3), well established products of PRMTs activity.
We will test whether ULK3 controls PRMT1 and 5 activity and/or links these enzymes to key substrates such as
p63, GLI2 and histones (specifically H4). We will further determine whether ULK3 control of gene transcription
in HKCs and SCC involves a broader impact on chromatin organization through convergent PRMT1- and 5-
dependent mechanisms. 3) We will test the hypothesis that ULK3 is a target of translational relevance for skin
field cancerization. We will undertake a dual genetic and pharmacological approach. Genetically, we have
developed mice with Ulk3flox alleles and K14- CreER transgene for keratinocyte-specific Ulk3 deletion. We will
examine the impact of Ulk3 deletion on normal skin homeostasis and, after transfer into an albino hairless
background, assess the consequences for UVB-induced skin field cancerization. Pharmacologically, we found
that ULK3 inhibitory compounds suppress proliferative potential of SCC cells as well as cancer/stromal cell
expansion. We will extend our studies with ULK3 and PRMT1/5 inhibitors on cultured cells and further test the
most promising compounds in an in vivo orthotopic model of skin cancer/stromal cells expansion."

Malaria is currently the most impactful mosquito-borne disease worldwide, sickening 228 million people and
killing over 405,000 in 2018, 2/3 of which are young children — the most vulnerable demographic. Several
mosquito species of the Anopheles genus can act as vectors of the parasite causing malaria, and in recent
years their increasing resistance to pesticides is hampering current control methods and blunting our response
to eventual disease outbreaks. Globalization is further allowing both vectors and pathogens to move freely and
in certain situations to permanently establish themselves in new locations.
CRISPR-based gene drive technologies for mosquito population engineering are being developed as they
represent a new promising addition to our arsenal for fighting this disease. These technologies are
up-and-coming, yet few issues have come up during their development. Briefly, a gene drive system based on
CRISPR is composed of a Cas9 and a gRNA gene inserted in the mosquito genome at the location where the
gRNA targets it. The arrangement of this genetic cassette endowed it with self-replicating properties that allow
it to propagate to the same location on a wild-type chromosome. This property can be harnessed to spread
within a population a beneficial trait that would help reducing disease transmission (population modification), or
a deleterious trait to help reduce the mosquito population (suppression).
While this process is extremely accurate, it can result in the failure of self-propagating, and the generation of
small mutations at the targeted locus preventing further conversion by the gene drive. These “resistance
alleles” generated during the drive process have been identified as a major hindrance to field applications of
these tools. In addition, due to the deposition of active Cas9 and gRNA in the developing embryo, the mosquito
biology allows an extensive production of such resistance alleles when a gene drive is inherited from a female.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop powerful gene drive tools that can be used for the fast and
reliable engineering of wild Anopheles populations.
In order for these tools to be ready to have an impact on the malaria morbidity worldwide, the two issues
described above need to be overcome. To tackle these two problems, in the three Aims of the proposed
research, we will develop and optimize three parallel technologies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and
subsequently apply them to the major malaria vector Anopheles stephensi."

Epilepsy is a severe and debilitating disease and a significant public health concern. Epilepsy is also a
disease without a medical cure, and a disease where about 1 in 3 patients fails to respond to anti-seizure
medications. In the most severe epilepsy syndromes of childhood, medical control of seizures can be even
more challenging. Novel experimental platforms have the potential to play a critical role in advancing our
understanding and treatment of epilepsy. Brain organoids derived from human embryonic or induced
pluripotent stem cells are one such novel technology that has enormous potential. This is particularly true for
severe childhood epilepsies, as organoids are ideally suited to model early neural development. Organoids are
3D structures that recapitulate complex elements of human brain such as its laminar organization and cell
types seen in all six layers of human cortex. Since they can be human induced-pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)
derived, an organoid can be produced directly from patient tissue. Recent advances in organoid technology
have resulted in the ability to generate distinct brain region-like organoids such as forebrain cortex and
hippocampus and to make “fusion” structures with integration of inhibitory and excitatory cell types.
 In the following proposal I will leverage these advances and build on an organoid platform that I have
recently developed to model brain circuit formation and dysfunction in epilepsy. Previously, l was able to
recapitulate hyperexcitable electrographic features in organoids derived from a patient with Rett syndrome, a
neurological disorder highly associated with seizures and epilepsy. I have now generated cortical and
hippocampal organoids from hiPSCs harboring mutations in the SCN8A gene. This mutation results in a
severe childhood epilepsy. I have found that the SCN8A mutant cortex organoids have a highly hyperexcitable
pattern of physiological activity compared to controls, whereas the SCN8A mutant hippocampus lacks a
particular type of neural oscillation that is important for memory consolidation called a sharp wave ripple. This
finding suggests that the SCN8A mutation results in different physiological activity patterns in distinct brain
regions. Based on published studies, I hypothesize that this difference is primarily due to dysfunction of
excitatory neurons in the cortex versus inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus. I will now use an array of
techniques such as calcium indicator imaging, extracellular recordings, immunohistochemistry, and
manipulation of the genetic background of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the organoid to test this
hypothesis. To increase the rigor and generalizability of my data, I will use hiPSC from three different patients
with pathogenic SCN8A mutations. Finally, I will perform drug testing to further isolate the role of specific cell
types to the observed phenotypes and for consideration as therapeutic agents in patients. I expect that this will
both provide a blueprint for a novel methodology for epilepsy research and enhance our treatment and
understanding of epilepsy and neural circuit dysfunction resulting from SCN8A mutations."
10832032,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the Theriot laboratory we apply cutting-edge technology and high-throughput methods to analyze the gut
microbiome and metabolome using a range of experimental techniques and animal models.
We leverage many
approaches that span diverse fields including bacterial genetics, bacterial physiology, protein engineering,
biochemistry, and apply a variety of omic approaches (microbiomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
metabolomics) in vitro and in vivo to define the mechanisms behind how the gut microbiota provides
colonization resistance against C. difficile.
One of the many essential functions of the indigenous gut microbiota is its ability to maintain colonization
resistance and to prevent establishment and growth of pathogens in the gut. There has been a great deal of
research in this area trying to define the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota mediates colonization
resistance. Potential mechanisms include competition for nutrients, taking up physical space or biomass,
production of inhibitory products, and shaping the host immune response. A popular model organism used to
interrogate these mechanisms is Clostridioides difficile due to its exquisite sensitivity to changes in the gut
microbiota structure and function. C. difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium first
isolated in 1935 and the causative agent for C. difficile infection (CDI). Unlocking how C. difficile is able to
benefit from the loss of colonization resistance in the gut has major implications for development of
therapeutics for prevention and treatment of CDI.
My long-term goal is to understand how the gut microbiota mediates colonization resistance against C. difficile.
The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationship between nutrient availability (amino
acids) and bile acid metabolism in the context of colonization resistance against C. difficile. Based on
preliminary data our hypothesis is that amino acid availability influences secondary bile acid production by
commensal Clostridia, which will alter colonization resistance against C. difficile. In order to investigate this
hypothesis, we plan to alter amino acid abundances in defined and rich media in vitro, and use defined diets in
vivo to understand how this impacts secondary bile acid production of commensal Clostridia. Leveraging our
robust and reproducible germfree and antibiotic treated mouse models of CDI, we will determine how these
metabolic processes affect the establishment and growth of C. difficile, as well as the surrounding gut microbial
community. Using novel platforms like LC-IMS-MS and Protein-SIP, we will define the gut metabolome and
metaproteome in the context of colonization resistance.
The contribution of the proposed research is significant as it seeks to move away from untargeted therapies
like FMT and move toward a targeted approach, whereby we can use diet (amino acids) to control secondary
bile acid production by commensal Clostridia, restoring colonization resistance against C. difficile. The findings
in this proposal will advance understanding of microbe-microbe interactions, host-microbe interactions, and
improve microbiome-based therapeutics. Beyond C. difficile it has the potential to allow us to intelligently
design customized therapeutic interventions to target human health conditions in the complex ecological
environment of the human intestine."
10815816,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are the most common childhood soft-tissue sarcomas affecting hundreds of
patients in the United States annually. Current standard treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients
include chemotherapy, surgery, and /or radiation. However, even with these combinations of therapeis,
significant subsets of patients suffer tumor recurrence, relapse, and metastasis, associated with extremely worse
prognosis and dismal 5-year survival rate. This remains the major hurdle to improve the patient outcomes with
rhabdomyosarcomas. To better understand the mechanisms such as tumor-propagating cells, critical molecular
regulators that drives therapy resistance and tumor-relapse in RMS, researchers has employed RMS cell lines,
transgenic animal models, and xenograft studies to study the potential tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) for RMS.
Yet, little is known about the tumor heterogeneity and cancer cell evolution dynamics in RMS. To dissect the
inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, I have used the single-cell transcriptomics to profile patient-derived
samples of RMS. I uncovered distinct cell states in RMS tumors, including proliferation and a mesenchymal-like
subpopulations that have higher TPC potential, whereas the differentiated muscle subpopulation that barely
transits towards other cell states. With this knowledge, and the innovation of barcode tracing techniques, I
propose to dissect molecular mechanisms that contribute to cell state transitions, and concurrently assess the
cell phenotypes changes along with its transcripts, proteins, and epigenetics alterations. One class of important
and challenging molecules in regulating cancer stemness, evolution post therapies is chromatin regulators, which
requires deep sequencing in limited cell line models. The technical innovation of single-cell multiomics, including
single-cell RNA, single-cell ATAC, single-cell CUT&Tag, and cell lineage barcode tracing largely decrease the
cost and time needed to profile cancer cell evolution along with epigenetic modifications at single-cell levels.
With effective collaboration with computational biologists, I hypothesize that EZH2 and its catalytic product
H3K27me3 lock RMS cells in the proliferative cell state and inhibit their transition into other differentiated states.
To test this hypothesis, I will first assess the role of EZH2 in regulating cell state transitions with barcode tracing
and functional stem assays in the context of EZH2 knockdown (Aim 1). Independently, I will also profile the direct
targets of EZH2 and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation by performing single-cell CUT&Tag, and interrogate
mechanism that controls cell state transition (Aim 2). In addition, I will also assess the EZH2 inhibitors in
collaboration with chemotherapy and radiation utilizing the unique immune-compromised zebrafish models along
with cell line and mouse xenograft studies (Aim 3). The goals of the proposed research are to investigate
chromatin regulators in rhabdomyosarcoma samples while also acknowledging the tumor-heterogeneity and cell
plasticity in cell state transitions. By achieving these aims, I will illustrate a comprehensive mechanism as to how
RMS tumors evolve and how chromatin regulators play critical roles in controlling this process."
10866398,"Recent technological advances have transformed genetics research, and social changes have caused major
shifts in best practices for graduate education, research training, and mentoring. We propose an innovative
interdisciplinary predoctoral T32 program, Genetic Mechanisms and Evolution (GME), which is specifically
crafted to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by these changes. The GME program will train a
diverse group of world-class Ph.D. scientists in molecular, statistical, and evolutionary genetics
research who will serve as the next generation of innovative scientific leaders in genetics. Training will
ensure development of multidisciplinary competence across these fields, with a strong foundation in
quantitative and computational analysis for every student.
 The GME training program leverages the world-class strength of the University of Chicago in genetics.
Mentors include 56 faculty with extraordinary records of research and graduate training, drawn from 14
departments across the fields of evolutionary, statistical, and molecular genetics. Further, the University’s
unique organizational structure brings all areas of genetics into a single division and makes possible the
interdisciplinary program we propose. Trainees for 18 funded positions will be selectively drawn from 9
graduate programs across disciplinary areas. The pool of potential trainees is extraordinarily well-qualified and
diverse (49% women and 26% URM over the last 5 years).
 Trainees will be funded in years 2-3 of their studies, but they will participate in training and advising
activities from matriculation through graduation. A new interdisciplinary core course and breadth requirements
will develop student foundations in molecular, statistical, and evolutionary genetics and build strong skills in
programming and statistics. Specialized workshops and an annual hackathon will provide further rigorous
training in computational and quantitative analysis of modern genetic data. Formal writing instruction along with
workshops in grant-writing and oral presentation skills will train scientists for effective communication and help
ameliorate disparities in preparation among students from diverse backgrounds. Individual development plans,
mentor-mentee contracts, faculty mentor training, and peer mentoring will facilitate trainee success and allow
growth of a mutually supportive community of faculty and students. Participation in a pioneering career
development program will support trainees in finding and preparing for a variety of post-PhD career paths.
Recruitment and retention of an increasingly diverse group of students will be further strengthened by
participating in pipeline and outreach programs, bridge activities for new students, and faculty training to
enhance the inclusivity of the training environment and admissions process. All these activities -- building on
the strengths of an exceptional cadre of trainees, trainers and institutional support – will allow us to recruit and
train the future leaders of 21st century genetics research."

Despite decades of critical research into its biological mechanisms and treatment approaches, Substance Use
Disorder (SUD) persists as a major world health problem. In the last few years, approximately 21 million people
required SUD treatment. Still, recent years have seen dramatic increases in the number of overdose deaths due
to heroin, prescription opioids, and cocaine. Interestingly, there is some work that suggests a circadian rhythm
and robust time-of-day shifts in the function of specific receptors and neurotransmitter systems that are routinely
implicated in drug abuse vulnerability and relapse. For example, diurnal (i.e., light/dark) variation has been
observed in mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, including rhythms in extracellular DA tone, DA transporter levels/
function, and DA receptor function. Moreover, research in both humans and animal models has observed that
level of drug taking and seeking can vary throughout the day. While published work demonstrates regulators of
diurnal variation in DA tone and tone regulators, there is a large gap in research dedicated to understanding
regulators of diurnal variation and circadian rhythms in subsecond, phasic DA release. This is particularly
important given the role of phasic DA release in reinforcement learning, motivation, and goal-directed behavior
that is altered in SUD. Moreover, little work has been dedicated to understanding how the function of intrinsic
modulators of phasic DA release, such as acetylcholine (ACh) from striatal cholinergic interneurons, vary across
time-of-day. Therefore, the overall objective of this research proposal is to determine the circadian diurnal
differences in rapid DA and ACh signaling and how these rhythms are mechanistically linked to changes in
motivated behavior, cocaine/reward seeking, and cue-reward associations. Our central hypothesis is that there
are times-of-day that individuals will exhibit increased sensitivity to reward- and cocaine-associated cues that
can lead to cocaine seeking, which are mediated by time-of-day variations in the cholinergic interneuron
modulation of rapid DA signaling. Specific Aim 1 will use rat models to investigate diurnal variation in 1) incentive
motivational value towards reward-associated cues using pavlovian conditioned approach task, 2) the degree to
which cues increase instrumental responding using a pavlovian-instrumental transfer task, and 3) the subjective
value of cocaine and corresponding motivation to take cocaine. We will also examine the magnitude of both DA
and ACh signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry across the
light / dark cycles. Specific Aims 2 and 3 will utilize voltammetry, fiber photometry, and optogenetics in freely-
behaving rats to measure diurnal modulation of phasic DA and CIN activity across a 24-hour day and define a
circuit specific mechanism for differences in motivated behavior, cocaine seeking, and corresponding magnitude
of NAc DA signals across the light and dark cycle."

Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) is a growing multibillion-dollar industry
leveraging a wide range of clinical, genomic, social, geographical, web-based, and wearable device data for
improvements in health outcomes broadly circumscribed under the term “precision health.” Powered by Big
Data, characterized by volume, velocity, veracity, variety, and value, “big knowledge” in the form of AI-CDS is
becoming increasingly ubiquitous (volume), rapidly developing (velocity), available to a wide range of medical
fields (variety), based on data from a wide range of sources that reflects the health of individuals and
populations (veracity), and focused on lowering costs and promoting better health outcomes (value). Current
policy paradigms for CDS, including whether to classify it as a medical device, are not designed for adaptive
artificial intelligence technologies. Patients and providers have no reasonable way to discern how these “black
box” technologies operate or their accuracy. Innovative policies (e.g. standards in product labeling) that
address these concerns are likely to require direct consumer outreach and communications to ensure public
trust in the growing AI-CDS field. Indeed, public trust in AI-CDS has been identified as a top priority for the AI-
CDS big knowledge ecosystem by the National Academy of Medicine, NIH, FDA, and OMB, among others.
Trust is particularly salient given the range of critical ethical and policy considerations related to transparency,
privacy, non-maleficence, equity, accountability, and utility of AI-CDS. In Aim 1 of our proposed study, we will
measure the public's current trust in AI-CDS for precision health and assess (a) its relationship to the public's
expectations and concerns about privacy, equity, non-maleficence, responsibility, and utility and (b) how it may
be affected by policies and practices, such as labeling or certification. In Aim 2 we will use deliberative
democracy methods and expert interviews, designed to directly inform policy and standards that address
perceived risks of AI-CDS and in Aim 3 we propose to develop a product information label that would both
increase transparency and accessibility of information about AI-CDS for patients and providers. The
continued acceptance and adoption of AI-CDS is predicated on public trust and our proposal provides
a research-focused and evidence-based approach to incorporating public participation into emerging
national standards."
10844481,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This research will examine how significant disruptions to children’s health, education and overall well-being
during the COVID-19 pandemic created lasting influence on health, development and social trajectories
through the lifecourse, and the risk for long-term health outcomes. Effects of the pandemic are unevenly
distributed amongst children, particularly with respect to race/ethnicity and income, and are anticipated to both
reflect and exacerbate the already wide health disparities in the United States. As vaccines continue to roll out,
inequality in access to and take up of vaccinations could compound the disparate outcomes.
New York City (NYC), where the 1 million public school children are majority Black or Hispanic (66%) and 74%
are low-income, is an ideal place to situate this research. In the health domain, changes in diet and physical
activity and missed healthcare may increase incidence and exacerbation of chronic diseases like obesity,
asthma and diabetes. The pandemic generated stress and anxiety, with fewer of the usual mental health
services supports available, posing risk for new and more severe health problems. Even after schools fully
return to in-person learning, the educational consequences are expected to be protracted – including declines
in academic achievement (test scores), increases in chronic absenteeism, repeating grades, or high school
dropout. The research leverages the NYC Student Population Health Registry (SPHR), a uniquely inclusive,
longitudinal database of all NYC public school students, created jointly by the NYC Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene and NYC Department of Education to examine these and other outcomes. SPHR links multiple
municipal data sources at the child-level, allowing us to examine the influence of the COVID pandemic on
myriad outcomes. The impact of variation in child-level, classroom-level and school-level vaccination rates will
be important to understand, and it is expected that neighborhood and school characteristics (income,
vaccination sites, emergency food resources, open space) will mitigate (or exacerbate) sustained impacts.
Identifying sources of resilience, at either the individual or neighborhood level, is a public health priority.
The specific aims are:
 • Aim 1: With a focus on disparities, determine health and education changes among children 2-4 years
 after pandemic onset compared to pre-pandemic using a new, comprehensive and powerful set of
 linked child-level administrative data.
• Aim 2: Determine how child-level, school-level and neighborhood-level COVID vaccination rates
 influence the course of the COVID pandemic, with a focus on disparities.
• Aim 3: Determine the role of neighborhood and school resources in exacerbating or mitigating health
and educational disparities due to the COVID pandemic."
10842241,"Structural genomic variation has only recently come into focus as a major source of genetic diversity in
humans, and in biology in general. Despite its critical importance, we still have a very limited understanding of
the processes that cause the structure of genomes to change over time, and of the consequences of these
large-scale changes to living organisms. Over the last four years of MIRA support, my laboratory has been
using two parallel and integrated approaches to study this problem, taking advantage of the unique research
tools available in the budding yeast model system. Our work has been fruitful. We have significantly advanced
the boundaries of our research field, while also contributing to the development of a new generation of
rigorously trained, creative young scientists. In the next funding cycle (1), we will continue to investigate the
forces that cause chromosomes to break, and the cellular mechanisms that are responsible for preventing,
surveying, and repairing this damage. To do so, we will use custom and highly sensitive cell-based assays to
measure the rate of gene copy number variation (CNV), Loss-of-Heterozygosity (LOH), and whole
chromosome gains and losses (aneuploidy), both in mitotic and meiotic cells. We will also deploy advanced
genomic analysis tools to characterize the associated structural changes. In addition, we will continue to
expand on a brand-new investigation front we opened through work carried out during the current funding
cycle. Specifically, we recently reported on a new form of structural mutagenesis (systemic genomic instability,
SGI), through which cells can acquire multiple rearrangements simultaneously, and thus radically reconfiguring
their genomes. In addition (2), we will also investigate the phenotypic consequences associated with
chromosomal rearrangements in a diploid yeast strain that shares many of the properties that characterize the
complex human genome. These include a high degree of heterozygosity, structural chromosomal
polymorphisms between homologs, gene redundancy, and CNVs; all the while retaining the small and
manageable genome of S. cerevisiae. I strongly believe that by opening these new and integrated avenues of
investigation, in close partnership with the talented junior colleagues I mentor in my laboratory, we will
contribute much needed insight into how structural genomic variation arises and how it affects all aspects of
life, from the evolution of species to human health."

Pediatric Acute Liver Failure (PALF) is a rare, devastating condition that affects an estimated 250 children per
year in North America, causing death in approximately 15% and the need for liver transplantation (LT) in an
additional 20-30%. In the majority of cases, a specific cause of the liver injury is never determined. Recent
research conducted in these patients supports the theory that many of these patients have liver injury related to
a hyperinflammatory immune response to everyday infections or environmental exposures. Studies have
recently implicated T lymphocytes as the central drivers of the inflammatory process. Physicians caring for PALF
patients are searching for therapies that quiet this T cell response, dampen the inflammatory cascade and allow
the patient’s remaining liver cells to heal and regenerate. Clinical experience in children with abnormal
hyperinflammatory immune responses associated with other disease states such as Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic
Arthritis and Acquired Aplastic Anemia has demonstrated that both high dose corticosteroids and equine anti-
thymocyte globulin can suppress immune responses and reverse progressive tissue damage. The goal of the
Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Immune Response Network (PALF IRN) is to support a treatment trial of
immunosuppressive therapy using high dose corticosteroids or equine anti-thymocyte globulin to reverse harmful
inflammatory immune responses in children with PALF to prevent further disease progression and reduce
mortality and LT in this population. We propose the TReatment for ImmUne Mediated PathopHysiology
(TRIUMPH) trial, a double-blind, three arm, randomized, placebo controlled trial of high dose methylprednisolone
or equine anti-thymocyte globulin. We will test the hypothesis that survival with native liver at 21 days post
randomization will be significantly higher in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy as compared to
patients that receive supportive care alone. We will also determine the safety of immunosuppressive therapy in
PALF patients and define the balance between risk of side-effects and treatment benefit. Our outcomes will
include not only clinical end-points such as patient survival, time to resolution of disease and adverse health
events, but also measures of patient reported outcomes during rehabilitation from the illness. Trial participants
will provide blood and liver samples that will be examined to better understand their immune responses,
especially that of T lymphocytes, in both the circulation and in the liver. Samples will be stored in a repository to
support future studies exploring new aspects of this rare disease."

 HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remain long-term
complications of HIV infection despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Even in early HIV infection and in
young adults who comprise 37% of new HIV infections, HAND impacts daily functioning and increases
morbidity. This impact of HAND in the young will impact the productivity of the work force worldwide. Currently,
our mechanistic insight into HAND pathogenesis in people living with HIV (PLWH) remains limited, and no
validated biomarkers exist to diagnose and manage NCI. HAND is believed to result from sustained
neuroinflammation. Unfortunately, growing evidence suggests inflammation is modulated by drugs of abuse,
including the drug of choice among young adults with HIV: marijuana. Marijuana's immunomodulatory effects
are largely anti-inflammatory, including suppression of T cell function and monocyte activation, the latter of
which is pivotal to HAND immunopathogenesis. This proposal leverages an existing multi-institutional
infrastructure focused on drugs of abuse in adult and adolescent HIV+ patients. Data from our group has found
that 1) THC treatment reduces monocyte activation; 2) compared to unimpaired, impaired patients have
increased CSF markers of neuronal injury (neurofilament (NFL), and 3) single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HIV-infected subjects reveals differentiated myeloid cells expressing
damage-associated microglia (DAM) genes (APOE and TREM2) and other markers of monocyte activation.
 This proposal will investigate the role of marijuana in modulating neuroinflammation and HAND and identify
a set of candidate biomarkers with potential to perform in the immunomodulatory context of substance abuse.
An ideal candidate biomarker is one that can perform in the context of HIV driven inflammation and
immunomodulation by drugs of abuse. This proposal will be the first to perform comprehensive, multi-domain
immune and transcriptomic profiling to investigate the effects of marijuana on systemic and neuroinflammation,
and its impact on cognition in young people living with HIV (YLWH). Within four groups (NCI-/MJ-, NCI+/MJ-,
NCI-/MJ+, NCI+/MJ+) we will 1) quantify differences in CNS and peripheral inflammatory biomarkers and
markers of neuronal injury; 2) evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective impact of marijuana
use; 3) determine the impact of marijuana on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cellular transcriptome via single cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify inflammatory pathways for future interventions; and 4) using novel
PET/MR techniques, quantify microglial activation and neuroinflammation and synaptic density via radiotracers
(peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)111 and UCB-J, respectively). Via these objectives, this proposal
will provided needed insight into HAND pathogenesis in the context of drug use. From an increased
understanding of its pathogenesis using novel immunological and neuroimaging, results will ultimately help
identify modulatory pathways of inflammation. Results from this study will add to our understanding of the
interplay between cannabinoids and inflammation both within HIV-infected and uninfected young adults. This
proposal has strong potential to lay the groundwork for studies to test novel therapeutics, such as cannabinoid
receptor ligands, and clinical interventions to reduce HAND morbidity in young adults with HIV."

Recombineering-based no-cleavage gene-editing toolkit for large-scale genome engineering
and functional screening
Exemplified by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, gene-editing technology is a powerful collection of
tools for probing the hidden mechanisms of human diseases by understanding and controlling
the functions of human genome variants. Limitations of existing CRISPR tools stem from two
sources: 1) Cas9 cutting causes uncontrollable DNA damage at on/off-target sites, leading to
toxicity and stress response. Recent studies confirmed that cutting-induced damages lead to
significant gene expression changes and enrichment of p53-mutant cells, thus confounding
some CRISPR screens; 2) CRISPR enzymes do not repair the target DNA, thus relying on
endogenous DNA repair to complete editing. This results in low efficiency and high variability for
Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) across cell types and models. To overcome
these limitations, we have identified a recombineering-based gene-editing tool, termed RecE/T-
induced Editing via Designer-Cas9-Initiated Targeting (REDIT). REDIT uses deactivated Cas9
(dCas9) and generates minimal DNA break and near-zero toxicity. REDIT uses phage
recombineering proteins RecE/T for gene-editing, bypassing the dependence on endogenous
repair mechanisms. Our proof-of-concept demonstration showed that REDIT achieved efficient
kb-scale editing without DNA cutting. We will focus on technology development and validation
with well-characterized models using gold-standard assays. The proposed RecE/T-like
recombineering proteins present new opportunities as they promote strand invasion/exchange
without cleavage when genome sites become transiently accessible via dCas9 DNA-unwinding.
Our goal is to develop a safe, scalable toolkit with up to 80% HDR efficiency for kilobase gene-
editing and pooled knock-in screening."

 The phagosome is a dynamically formed organelle that is generated upon phagocyte encounter with
cargo. Phagocytic receptors and other extracellular receptors engage with cargo-derived ligands prior to the
formation of the phagocytic cup at the cell membrane and subsequent phagocytosis. Following phagosome
formation, a dynamic series of steps proceed involving organelle trafficking and fusion. Ultimately, these
collective molecular events influence and shape phagosome function which is often characterized through the
lens of phagosome biochemistry (pH, metal ion abundance, oxidative radicals, and enzyme activity).
 While many of the stereotyped features of phagosome maturation and biochemistry have been studied,
there has been relatively fewer studies that take an integrated systems-level view from signaling to phagosome
biochemistry. Furthermore, while the field has defined several features of general phagocytosis, phagosome
biology is incredibly complex. Several distinct cell types can perform phagocytosis ranging from professional
phagocytes (ex: macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells) to non-professional phagocytes (ex: fibroblasts).
Adding another layer of complexity, phagocytes engulf a diverse array of cargo ranging from pathogens to
apoptotic bodies. Combined with the temporal maturation of the phagosome, these three axes construct a
complex landscape for phagosome biology. In depth study of this landscape has not been performed limiting our
fundamental understanding of molecular control of this organelle.
 Here, we propose a research program centered around the question: “how is control of phagosome
biology achieved?” To address these questions, my research program integrates approaches in genetics, protein
engineering, systems biology, immunology, and microbiology. We seek to address three knowledge gaps in our
program initially. (1) Is there crosstalk in signaling among receptors (phagocytic and soluble ligand) during
phagocytosis? (2) How do cargo and phagocyte identity instruct phagosome composition? (3) What are the
molecular circuits that control phagosome biochemistry? Over the next five years, we will develop a strategy to
examine higher-order interactions in phagocytosis signaling. Furthermore, we will engineer specific cargo
capable of performing proximity labeling in the phagosome. Lastly, we will define the molecular circuits that
control phagosome biochemistry. These questions are inextricably coupled, and our program operates in a highly
collaborative manner. Supporting our experimental systems is a strong quantitative modeling and analytical
framework equipped to derive novel insights from high-throughput experiments and propose new experimental
directions. Together, these strengths position us in a unique manner to address longstanding questions in
phagosome biology."
10851769,"Protein-protein interactions transmit information, shape cell structure, assemble complexes, and enable
chemical transformations that support life. Mapping and decoding the human interactome to establish which
interactions occur, what functions they support, and how interactions are altered in disease are critical goals
for biology. There is also a biomedical imperative to learn to inhibit or modulate protein interactions for
discovery research and the development of new therapies. This proposal presents an integrated program of
computational and experimental studies of protein-protein interactions that involve short linear motifs (SLiMs)
binding to modular, structurally conserved interaction domains. SLiM are abundant, with estimates of more
than 105 binding motifs in the human proteome, and they play critical roles in signal transduction and the
assembly of structural and regulatory complexes that are implicated in disease. The domains that bind to
SLiMs, such as EVH1, TRAF, SH3, WW, etc., occur in many copies in the proteome due to the expansion of
paralogous families by domain duplication and divergence. This research program will address two key
questions. (1) The paralog specificity question: How do the interactions made by paralogous protein domains
overlap vs. differ, and how are distinct binding profiles encoded in similar sequences and structures?
Answering this will provide currently missing links in the interactome and support the prediction and design of
paralog-specific interactions, which will improve our knowledge of disease pathways and how to target them.
(2) The SLiM specificity question: What sequence/structure features determine SLiM binding and how is this
regulated? Learning the features that distinguish real interactors from myriad motif-matching false positives
in the proteome will uncover mechanisms of SLiM recognition and support the prediction of new interactions.
This proposal focuses on developing new methods and models that will be applied to study biomedically
important SLiM-binding EVH1 and Atg8-like domains. EVH1 domains are found in proteins that bind to proline-
rich motifs, including members of the Ena/VASP family that regulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
Atg8-like proteins are critical for autophagy and participate in forming the autophagosome and recruiting cargo
for degradation by binding to selective autophagy receptors. Increased or decreased autophagy contributes
to many diseases via poorly understood mechanisms. The proposed studies will combine high-throughput
interaction mapping using experimental cell-surface display screening with data-driven modeling using deep
learning to support the detection, prediction, and design of new interactions. The screening-plus-modeling
approach will reveal new interaction partners for each family that broaden our understanding of cell biology,
elucidate mechanisms of specificity, and provide new techniques for designing selective inhibitors of these
and other protein-protein interactions."
10838559,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens have rendered HIV/AIDS a manageable chronic condition rather
than a fatal disease, and people living with HIV (PLWH) that initiate ART soon after infection can achieve almost
normal life expectancy. This leads to an aging population of PLWH that are increasing subject to a collection of
age-associated diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In spite of effective control of
viremia, HIV-induced inflammation is incompletely resolved following ART initiation, and this chronic
inflammation leads to a variety of comorbidities, including increased risk for the same age-related diseases.
Women living with HIV (WLWH) now comprise the majority of the global HIV/AIDS population and represent the
preponderance of new cases. However, women are still underrepresented in clinical studies in spite of significant
sex differences in multiple aspects of HIV pathology. As a consequence of the increased survival of PLWH, more
WLWH will now undergo menopause and be subject to a disease burden that reflects age, ART-associated
chronic inflammation, and, in addition, any adverse consequences of postmenopausal estrogen deficiency. The
likely effects of estrogen deficiency will involve changes in systemic metabolic status, white adipose tissue (WAT)
function and control of glucose and lipid metabolism, and suppression of the circulating and tissue latent
reservoirs based on the recent discovery that estrogen receptor-α is a negative regulator of the HIV reservoir.
We hypothesize that estrogen replacement will reduce the scope and severity of ART-associated metabolic
comorbidities and facilitate ART suppression of latent reservoirs in WLWH. We propose to address this
hypothesis using a unique nonhuman primate model of female rhesus macaques infected with a novel barcoded
strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), then treated with a current ART regimen until full suppression,
followed by ovariectomy and subsequent estrogen deficiency or estrogen replacement by silastic implants.
This hypothesis will be addressed through pursuit of the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Determine the effect of E2 replacement on metabolism and WAT function in an nonhuman
primate (NHP) model of postmenopausal WLWH. Female rhesus macaques will be infected with SIV, treated
with ART until full suppression, and then ovariectomized with subsequent replacement with premenstrual levels
of estrogen or placebo vehicle. Glucose and lipid metabolic parameters and levels of circulating adipocytokines
and WAT immune cell profiles and WAT function will be assessed longitudinally throughout the study.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the effect of E2 replacement on peripheral, secondary lymphoid, and WAT SIV latent
reservoirs. The size, complexity, and clonality of the plasma, cell-associated and inducible, replication-competent
reservoirs will be assessed following modulation of estrogen status using multiple quantitation approaches."
10835008,"The movement of 90-90-90: Treatment for All aims to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030; however, there were still
1.7 million new HIV infections in 2019 worldwide, emphasizing the need to improve current systems of HIV
epidemic monitoring and targeted preventions and interventions. As a renewal application of the parent R01
project (AI095066), this proposal builds upon our pioneering accomplishments of inventing microdrop HIV
sequencing for high-resolution and low-cost simultaneous HIV incidence and drug resistance surveillance. Our
single blood draw assay approach, HIDA (HIV Incidence and Drug Resistance Assay), responds to the growing
need to precisely determine HIV incidence and identify drug resistance mutations, including minority variants and
cross-class drug resistance mutations linked in a single genome. Our major innovation is to amplify HIV full-
length envelope and pol gene sequences within micro-droplets and this compartmental amplification alongside
with long-read high-throughput sequencing allows us to extract incidence and drug resistance signatures in a
highly precise manner. The central goal of this application is to deliver an end-to-end platform for real-time HIV
incidence and drug resistance cross-sectional surveillance. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct a cross-sectional
surveillance by accessing 2,658 HIV positive plasma specimens from the Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact
Survey (NAIIS), in partnership with Nigeria CDC. By producing massive HIV full-length envelope and pol gene
sequences, we will report Nigeria’s regional HIV incidence profiles and 93 WHO surveillance drug resistance
mutation prevalence at the population and individual levels. Aim 2 of this application is devoted to devise a low-
cost, open-source laboratory automation platform. Recent advances in do-it-yourself automation platforms will
facilitate the deployment of HIDA’s microdrop HIV sequencing into low- and middle- income countries for their
perpetual HIV surveillance. This standardized, high-throughput automation platform is ideal for performing cross-
sectional surveys in resource-limited settings. Aim 3 will integrate HIDA with a cloud-based platform that fully
automates incidence and drug resistance surveillance algorithms as a software-as-a-service. The standardization
of high-throughput sequencing data analysis is a central requirement for routine surveillance. HIDA’s software-
as-a-service will output standardized, high-quality surveillance outcomes directly to users, circumventing the
need for investigators to invest in high-cost hardware to perform their own time-consuming analyses. This cloud
platform will report both population-level and individual-level incidence and drug resistance profiles in a given
geographic region. HIDA via microdrop HIV sequencing will promote global real-time surveillance by serving as
a precise and high-throughput cross-sectional survey tool for incidence and drug resistance."

10851732,"Abstract.
 The United States (U.S.) has experienced higher mortality than any other nation due to COVID-19 with nearly
13.5 million cases and over 268,103 deaths. Due to the limited ability to socially distance, poor ventilation, and
limited hygiene supplies, U.S. prisons and jails have observed explosive transmission of SARS-CoV-2
accounting for the 10 largest U.S. outbreaks. Because 95% of criminal justice-involved individuals reenter society
COVID-19 transmission extends beyond those who are currently incarcerated. As justice-involved individuals
reenter the community, they face high rates of homelessness, and many others live in other congregate settings
such as converted hotels and halfway houses. The increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 while incarcerated coupled
with the likelihood of living in congregate settings after incarceration, create conditions ripe for rapid COVID-19
transmission that will be critical to address in order to gain control of COVID-19 in the U.S. The goal of this study
is to test the impact and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among
justice-involved individuals recently released from incarceration. We will conduct a randomized trial to compare
the effectiveness of an onsite Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2 testing and education intervention with community
health workers (CHWs) as a central component compared to the standard of care at a community-based
organization (CBO) that provides services to justice-involved individuals in New York City. We will measure costs
of testing, education, and navigation, and explore the cost-effectiveness of the onsite Point-of-Care intervention
compared to the standard of care. Our specific aims are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-
CoV-2 intervention in a corrections-focused CBO; 2) Model the cost-effectiveness of an onsite PoC SARS-CoV-
2 intervention among CJIs compared to SoC. Because testing, education, and navigation will be provided by
CHWs in a culturally-sensitive environment and test results will be received in minutes (rather than days), we
hypothesize that O-PoC will be associated with improved testing uptake and receipt of test results, mitigation
behaviors (mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing), and those who attend more O-PoC sessions will
have better adherence to mitigation behaviors."

Recent findings identified that Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1+ CD8 T cells recognizing tumor or chronic
pathogens have a division of labor: T cell factor (TCF)-1+ PD-1+ CD8 T cells function as memory-like resource
cells and TCF-1neg PD-1+ CD8 T cells have effector-like function. TCF-1+ PD-1+ CD8 T cells self-renew and
differentiate into effector-like and terminally differentiated/more exhausted TCF-1neg PD-1+ CD8 T cells. TCF-1+
memory-like cells have high expression CD28, and we have shown that during PD-1 targeted therapies CD28
costimulation is required for the reinvigoration of CD8 T cell responses. In addition, memory-like cells have high
expression of ICOS, and a gene expression program with similarities to follicular helper CD4 T cells. Our
preliminary data suggest that during established chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection,
continuous CD28 signaling is required for differentiation and self-renewal of TCF-1+ memory-like PD-1+ CD8 T
cells. In contrast, ICOS signaling diminishes differentiation into effector-like cells. How memory-like cells choose
between self-renewal and differentiation, and how to modulate differentiation into effector-like cells are critical
questions. In addition to a unique set of costimulatory molecules, TCF-1+ memory-like cells also express a
distinct set of chemokine/cytokine receptors. Based on these data and the knowledge gap in the field, we propose
to define the role of costimulation in the maintenance and differentiation of PD-1+ CD8 T cells (Aim 1) and
uncover the impact of cellular interactions (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will determine how CD28 and ICOS
costimulation affect TCF-1+ memory-like PD-1+ CD8 T cells and identify transcriptional regulators of T cell fate.
In Aim 2, we will use an unbiased approach to identify cellular interactions of TCF-1+ memory-like PD-1+ CD8 T
cells in vivo and probe the biological consequences of these interactions for T cell fate decisions. XCL-1, a
chemoattractant for XCR1+ dendritic cells (DC1) is highly expressed by TCF-1+ memory-like cells and modulated
by CD28 signaling. We will address the role of DC1 antigen presentation and XCL-1 production on localization,
differentiation and self-renewal of TCF-1+ memory-like PD-1+ CD8 T cells. Understanding the determinants of
self-renewal and differentiation of T cells chronically exposed to antigens would have broad implications for
immunotherapies in many pathologies (chronic infections, cancer, autoimmunity, transplantation and allergy)."
10849689,"Project Summary
 Post-translational signaling through ubiquitination is essential to all eukaryotic life, and dysregulation of this
process can lead to severe forms of disease. The far-reaching importance of ubiquitin signaling across many
cellular processes stems from its ability to form a diverse set of polymeric chains that signal for distinct
outcomes. The complexity of ubiquitin signaling vastly outweighs our understanding of its regulation and
cellular outcomes. While the signaling roles for some ubiquitin chain types are known (e.g. protein degradation
or cell cycle regulation), the functions of many so-called `atypical' chains have remained a mystery despite
decades of research. As an alternative approach to studying fundamental human biology, we study the
interactions between invading pathogenic bacteria and the host ubiquitin signaling network. In addition to a
range of other ubiquitin-targeted activities, to support infection bacteria have evolved secreted effector proteins
to assemble and remove host ubiquitin signals, in some cases with exquisite specificity toward discrete
ubiquitin chain types. We propose that ubiquitin-targeted bacterial effectors represent a rich opportunity to
study human ubiquitin signaling from an `outside-in' perspective. To explore this opportunity, we have
developed a multipronged approach that has identified novel ubiquitin-targeted activities among important
bacterial pathogens. Using structural and biochemical approaches we will explain the mechanisms and
specificities of these bacterial enzymes, at which point they will be used as case studies and tools to extend
our work toward deciphering the regulatory and signaling complexities of the human ubiquitin system. Our
innovative approach to studying ubiquitin biology plays to our strengths in the biochemical mechanisms of its
regulation, and leverages the strong evolutionary pressure placed on bacteria to usurp specific aspects of host
ubiquitin signaling. Over the next five years we will demonstrate the breadth of bacterial ubiquitin-targeted
activities and their utility for dissecting the intricacies of ubiquitin signaling, which feeds into our larger vision of
understanding the motivations and ramifications of bacterial interference in host signaling processes."
10835915,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Research in the field of microbiome has largely focused on the beneficial effects of commensal bacteria in
regulating tissue homeostasis and the immune responses. However, a commensal role for virome in supporting
human health has not been explored. We propose to investigate the commensal virome and its beneficial impact
on tissue homeostasis and cancer protection in barrier epithelia. Informed by our recent discovery of the
beneficial role of low-risk commensal papillomaviruses and the immunity against them in protecting the skin
against carcinogen-driven cancer, we propose a completely novel approach to prevent nonviral cancers by using
the patients’ own virome and the immune system to precisely target early malignant clones within the barrier
epithelia. In particular, the widespread presence of commensal human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in barrier
epithelia and the ability of a competent immune system in adults to control these viruses will provide a unique
opportunity to determine the interplay of commensal viruses, epithelial tumors and the immune system. To
accomplish this, we will use novel mouse models of papillomavirus colonization to (1) determine the impact of
commensal HPVs on maintaining the homeostasis of epithelium exposed to environmental carcinogens, (2)
identify the innate immune factors that are required for the activation of antiviral T cells targeting malignant cells
while spare the virus-positive normal tissue, and (3) determine the role of papillomaviruses that colonize the oral
mucosa on the carcinogen-induced head and neck cancer. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish
a fundamental role for commensal virome in combating the early stages of cancer development and provide the
means to prevent and treat nonviral epithelial cancers using patients’ own virome and the immune cells."
10795037,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become standard of care for an increasing number of
malignancies with up to 230,000 patients eligible for ICI therapy annually in the US alone. Despite their
efficacy, ICIs are associated with morbid and potentially fatal toxicities, known as immune-related adverse
events (irAEs). Cutaneous irAEs (cirAEs) are the most frequently reported toxicities, occurring in 20-40% of all
treated patients with over 40 distinct morphologic subtypes reported in literature to date. Though these
toxicities vary in severity, they have a considerable burden on patient quality of life and may result in
interruption of life-saving ICI therapy or reliance on systemic immunosuppression that may blunt the anti-tumor
effect of ICIs. There is an urgent need to understand how and why these adverse reactions occur and reduce
their impact. This study will investigate the real-world epidemiology, downstream clinical implications, and risk
factors for the development of these toxicities using cross-validated institutional and population-level data.
 Our first aim proposes a robust observational study to identify cutaneous eruptions with the strongest
associations with ICI therapy, which will, in turn, be used to identify clinical risk factors for the development of
these events and their downstream outcomes. This is particularly important as cirAE data from clinical trials of
ICIs was largely documented by non-dermatologists with resulting limited dermatologic phenotyping. Further,
there is currently a lack of large-scale data on cirAEs and an absence of definitional standards for what
constitutes a cutaneous immunotherapy toxicity, limiting all research in this field. We will further investigate the
impact of cirAEs on systemic immunosuppression utilization and survival.
 Our second aim will identify germline associations for cirAE development using tissue samples
collected from ICI recipients at our institutions. Many autoimmune diseases have germline risk variants of large
effect in the HLA region and we hypothesize that HLA variation will also influence development of cirAEs. Our
preliminary data has demonstrated that patients with cirAEs were more likely to be HLA-DR4 carriers and that
polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for autoimmunity predisposition were also significantly associated with cirAEs.
Ongoing genotyping at our institution will enable validation of these results and expansion of our risk prediction
models to identify additional genetic variants within and outside the HLA region.
 Results from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated into a combined clinical and genetic risk stratification tool
for cirAE development in Aim 2c. Since cirAEs are the earliest ICI toxicities to occur and are highly correlated
with development of non-cutaneous irAEs, this risk stratification will, in turn, enable clinicians to prioritize more
intensive cancer therapies for patients least likely to develop toxicity as well as to provide enhanced
surveillance of vulnerable populations at highest risk of developing these events."
10892017,"Chronic masticatory muscle pain disorders (MMPD) affect between 5-12% of the population, are the second
most common musculoskeletal pain conditions after chronic low back pain, and are associated with
management costs of over $4 billion per year, presenting a serious public health issue. Multidisciplinary care
combining dental care with psychological interventions appears to offer the best prognosis. Physical self-
regulation (PSR) is a brief, two-session psychological intervention that has been shown to lead to long-term
reductions in pain intensity over standard dental care alone in patients with chronic MMPD. Unfortunately,
treatment utilization for PSR is low when it is offered in-person, with fewer than 50% of eligible patients
choosing to begin treatment. Offering PSR over telehealth (PSR-TH) may help address this issue, with
preliminary data demonstrating >80% treatment utilization for PSR-TH. A full-scale trial is needed to test the
efficacy of PSR-TH and 1) determine if PSR-TH effects are due to the intervention itself or to nonspecific
treatment effects and 2) determine moderators and mediators of treatment effects. However, additional data
are needed before such a trial can be conducted. The goal of this proposal is to obtain data to support a future
full-scale Phase II efficacy trial by achieving the following specific aims. First, PSR-TH and a control
intervention need to be formally piloted in patients with MMPD to determine recruitment and retention rates,
interventionist fidelity, and patient-reported acceptability, credibility, and burden of the interventions (Aim 1).
Second, we need to identify potential moderators and mediators of PSR-TH so that we can focus on
thoroughly assessing those specific variables in the future trial (Aim 2). Treatment-seeking females with
chronic MMPD will be randomly assigned to two 50-min telehealth sessions of PSR-TH or a control
intervention (N=52/group) and will provide biopsychosocial moderator data (week 0), treatment feasibility data
immediately following the intervention (week 3), mediation data two weeks following the intervention (week 5),
and outcome data (pain intensity, pain interference, and quality of life) two weeks and three months following
the intervention (weeks 5 and 15). We hypothesize that both PSR-TH and the control intervention will
demonstrate strong feasibility (i.e., recruitment of at least 1 participant per week, >75% retention, >95%
interventionist fidelity, and adequate acceptability, credibility, and burden). We also hypothesize that specific
biopsychosocial variables will moderate PSR-related changes in outcomes, and that PSR-TH-related changes
in perceived control over pain, self-efficacy, coping, parafunctional habits, and relaxation will mediate treatment
effects. In addition to supporting a future efficacy trial of PSR-TH, the proposed project will leverage my
previous training, a collaborative environment at the University of Kentucky, and the expertise of world-renown
mentors to provide me training in clinical research, assessment of moderators and mediators in orofacial pain,
and leadership of research teams, giving me the skills for a successful independent clinical research career."
10899437,"Project Summary
The quantity of opioid prescriptions dispensed in the United States (US) is so high that every other person
could receive one opioid prescription. Many of these opioids go unused and are kept in homes rather than
disposed after ceasing use. The primary source of prescription opioids for nonmedical use is relatives or
friends; which suggests that diversion of excess and retained prescription opioids contribute significantly to
nonmedical use and associated consequences. Without effective strategies to facilitate their secure storage
and disposal, prescription opioids will remain in communities, increasing the likelihood for nonmedical use-
related morbidity and mortality. Our long-term goal is to prevent nonmedical prescription opioid use by
decreasing accessibility of unused medications in the home. The overall objective of this R03 application is to
assess (1) the extent to which disposal boxes have been implemented in pharmacies across the US, (2)
accessibility of disposal boxes to diverse community members, and (3) determinants of implementation. To
achieve this objective, we propose two specific aims: (1) generate prevalence estimates of disposal box
implementation in US pharmacies and examine place-based health disparities in implementation, and (2)
examine determinants of pharmacy-based disposal box implementation using the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR). For Aim 1, we will sample 1,000 of the nation's approximately 60,000 retail
pharmacies, geocode locations, and link with disposal box presence and neighborhood characteristics. We will
conduct logistic regression with clustering to examine inequities in neighborhood characteristics that are
associated with disposal box implementation (primary outcome). For Aim 2, we will conduct semi-structured
interviews with a sample of 60 pharmacies who have and have not implemented medicine disposal boxes and
will link geocoded neighborhood characteristics with qualitative data. The proposed research study is
innovative, in our opinion, in that it applies an approach that has been piloted by the PI in a single state to
study pharmacy-based disposal boxes by (1) developing nationwide prevalence estimates of disposal boxes
across the US, (2) examining place-based health disparities associated with implementation, (3) assessing
determinants of implementation using a theoretical framework, and (4) uniquely linking interview themes and
neighborhood characteristics. The proposed research is significant in that findings will advance the
understanding of inequities in and determinants of disposal box implementation at pharmacies and pave the
way for comparative efficacy studies. The proposed study is relevant to NIDA's priorities to implement and
evaluate theoretically-based, prevention interventions that can be implemented in healthcare settings to elicit
population-level impacts to address the ongoing opioid crisis."
10809727,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genome stability is determined by multiple DNA repair pathways, including both error-prone and error-free
mechanisms. Mutations can be caused by inactivation of DNA repair pathways (e.g. BRCA1 defects) or by
pathological activation of error-prone repair. The tumor suppressor p53 has pleiotropic effects on this balance.
It physically interacts with base excision repair (BER), modulates nucleotide excision repair (NER), and
regulates mismatch repair (MMR). Wild type p53 may inhibit error prone, but not error-free non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ), and can modulate homologous recombination (HR). Recently, new roles for p53 have
been identified, such as a role in APOBEC3B activation. Many mechanistic studies have studied the complex
roles of p53 in DNA repair, but few large-scale studies of human tumors have investigated p53 and DNA repair
pathway function in human tumors, and even fewer have evaluated these relationships by race. A more refined
understanding of the relationships between p53 loss, DNA repair, and mutational signatures is now possible
due to: (1) the advent of mutational signatures, which can provide DNA evidence of the functional effects and
balance across multiple error prone and error free DNA repair pathways; and (2) recent improvements in
expression profiling from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. These advances are important for
understanding breast cancer mortality disparities because they enable broad scale study in population-based
resources. Our previous population-based studies have shown that p53 mutations are more common in African
American breast cancer patients (60% p53 mutant vs. 35% among white breast cancer patients). Furthermore,
DNA repair is critical for response to chemotherapy, both due to direct effects of DNA repair on chemotherapy
resistance, and indirect effects on activation of immune responses. The current project will use an integrative
approach to evaluate p53-related DNA repair pathway irregularities in human tumors, measuring both RNA
expression and mutational signatures (Aim 1a). Then, p53 loss and DNA repair imbalance will be evaluated in
relation to immune activation using both RNA and protein-based, spatial assays of immune markers (Aim 1b).
These analyses will leverage, the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS), a study of 3000 women with breast
cancer that oversampled black women (50% black women, n=1500). To better understand the germline
determinants of black-white differences in DNA repair, existing genome wide SNP data will be used to identify
genetic variants linked with DNA repair imbalance and immune response (Aim 2). This investigation will identify
key DNA repair and immune pathways, in context of p53 mutation status and race, that interact to cause
cancer progression and chemoresistance. The elucidation of these pathways is a key underlying step in
identifying clinical and public health interventions to reduce mortality disparities.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects about 13.5% of the U.S population over the age of 60 and
impacts the central part of the visual field, which provides high-acuity visual function and serves as the
reference point for eye movements. The type of functional loss depends on the extent to which the scotomata
in the two eyes overlap. When the scotomata locations in the two eyes overlap and include the fovea, the
resultant binocular central field loss (CFL) can significantly impact daily life, particularly tasks that require high-
acuity vision, such as reading. Binocular CFL also causes individuals to adopt an eccentric preferred retinal
locus (PRL) for fixation, which takes several years to become the reference for eye movements and
complicates simple goal-directed behavior such as finding items of interest. We will investigate the challenges
of using the PRL for visuomotor behavior and investigate whether coordinated eye and hand movements can
facilitate the transition to the PRL as an oculomotor reference (Aim 1). We will also address challenges that are
independent of the overlap of the scotomata in the two eyes. Specifically, individuals can experience loss of
stereopsis in the parts of the visual field that correspond to a scotoma in either eye, regardless of whether their
scotoma is binocular or monocular, leading to difficulty with eye-hand coordination tasks in near space and
with navigating stairs and drop-offs. To address these challenges, we will investigate the potential for the
periphery to mediate stereopsis (Aim 2). We will also examine the potential of monocular cues such as motion
parallax to mediate depth perception, particularly for those individuals who have spared central fields in one
eye (Aim 3). In sum, our research plan seeks to understand the impact of binocular scotomata and more
extensive stereo-blind zones on eye movements, hand-eye coordination, and mobility in macular degeneration,
under binocular, real world viewing conditions."

comprehensive support for the development of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees as the next generation of
Immunology research scientists. It is based in a group of 32 outstanding faculty, whose research programs are
centered in Immunology, but oriented towards infectious disease, cancer, autoimmunity, allergic disease,
inflammation, immune system development, vascular biology, or neuroscience. They are from 7 University
Departments and 6 Divisions of the Dept of Medicine, creating a rich interdisciplinary research environment
where trainees are exposed to a range of ideas and cutting-edge technologies, augmented by the highly collegial
and collaborative environment of UVA. Trainees and mentors are brought into contact through their involvement
in activities supported by the ITP, including courses, workshops, seminars, Research-In-Progress presentations,
and advisory committees. The ITP structure overcomes traditional departmental barriers by establishing cross-
disciplinary interest in trainee activities and oversight of trainee performance and progress. The organization of
graduate recruiting at UVA also supports this interdisciplinary approach, while at the same time increasing the
visibility of Immunology as a Research Discipline to enhance our ability to attract outstanding applicants.
Recognizing the inherently translational orientation of contemporary Immunology and the central importance of
the immune system in many human pathologies, the structure and activities of the UVA ITP are also designed
to bridge the gap between basic and clinical science. The mentors include a strong cohort of translational/clinical
scientists who move work in animal models into patient settings and engage in trainee-related activities that
expose PhD-based graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to clinical problems. Conversely, we support an
MD postdoctoral fellow to develop the next generation of Physician-Scientists who will address questions in
human Immunology at a basic level. Over the last 26 years, the UVA ITP has recruited an outstanding group of
both pre- and postdoctoral trainees, including a strong cohort of trainees from disadvantaged groups, and has
propelled them towards productive careers as research scientists. To continue this record of achievement, we
request support for 6 predoctoral trainees, selected from a group of highly qualified first year graduate students
who have already been highly scrutinized during initial recruitment into our umbrella Biomedical Sciences (BIMS)
graduate program. We also request support for 2 postdoctoral trainees. They may hold a PhD, and be selected
based on the excellence of their graduate student work, and their demonstrated commitment and productivity
during an initial year of postdoctoral research. Alternatively, they may be Physician-Scientists, highly dedicated
to a career in academic medicine, chosen from board-eligible or board-certified MD or MD-PhD fellows in UVA
clinical departments. Recognizing the diversity of career paths available to both pre- and postdoctoral trainees,
the ITP is strongly committed to supporting trainees who will pursue research intensive or related careers."

The Tissue Pathology and Biospecimen Shared Resource (TPB SR) provides histology services and procures,
banks, and distributes human cancer and control tissue and fluid samples. The TPB SR is directed by Kar-
Ming Fung, MD, PhD (CT), a pathologist who also serves as a liaison between SCC researchers and other
pathologists. During the reporting period, the TPB SR completed a successful integration of the pre-existing
SCC biospecimen repository into the TPB SR with a newly established annotated database and an online

5) isolation of circulating tumor cells and laser capture microscopy. The biospecimen arm provides: 1)
procurement and banking services for fresh and fixed specimens with an annotated database; 2) an online
collection catalog on the institutional intranet with a dash-board type display; and 3) search and retrieval of
archival materials from the Department of Pathology. The website and data are stored in electronically and
physically separated computers to prevent breach of information. Both arms are housed in SCC-designated
space in the OUHSC’s laboratory research complex (BRC & BMSB), a convenient location for a majority (52 of
63 total) lab-based SCC members. From 2017 to 2021, usage by Cancer Biology (CB), Cancer Therapeutics
(CT), and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) program members was 58%, 36% and 6%, respectively.
During this period, SCC members (full and associate) accounted for 60% of total SR usage. SCC members
with peer-reviewed support accounted for more than half (52%) of total SR usage, and 87% of SCC member
usage. SCC affiliate members (i.e., non-CCSG members who conduct cancer-related work) accounted for
another 20% of total usage. Data generated by the TPB SR was used to secure 11 peer-reviewed funded
cancer research grants as well as many other grants and scientific publications. TPB SR services are offered
free-of-charge to SCC members. This waiver of fees is approved on an annual basis by the SCC director and
provides a significant value-added benefit for SCC members to foster research."
10838597,"MOBILE HEALTH TECHNOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE: ABSTRACT
The Mobile Health Technology Shared Resource (mHealth SR) is a Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC)-
managed facility which develops advanced mobile applications that aim to prevent cancer, supplement cancer
treatment, and improve quality of life for cancer survivors. Under the overall direction of founding director
Michael Businelle, PhD (CPC), the mHealth SR works with SCC researchers and other users to create
innovative mobile applications that 1) identify and intervene upon environmental, cognitive, affective,
physiological, and behavioral antecedents of risk factors (e.g., smoking, heavy alcohol use, obesity, medication
non-adherence) linked to cancer (primary, secondary and tertiary prevention), and 2) supplement and support
cancer treatment. Applications are developed using state-of-the-science, cross-platform design instruments
that facilitate data capture real time in real-life environments using a wide range of devices and technologies
(e.g., smartphone based self-report assessments, wearable activity monitors, global positioning data, other
Bluetooth enabled devices). mHealth SR staff and leadership employ their expertise to develop and manage
mHealth studies, cross-platform programming, and the integration of multiple data streams to create
dynamically tailored and adaptive interventions. Leveraging this specialized set of skills, technical knowledge,
and SCC infrastructure, the mHealth SR enables rapid translation of innovative research ideas into low-cost
and highly disseminable applications. The SCC established the mHealth SR in November 2015 to facilitate
community outreach and engagement with the goal of addressing the needs of underserved populations in the
SCC catchment area. This investment is in response to a 2014 External Advisory Board recommendation to
establish a shared resource that would allow for tailored data gathering and intervention development. The
mHealth SR has experienced significant growth since it received an “Outstanding to Exceptional” merit score
during the last CCSG review. During the reporting period, 13 unique SCC members utilized the mHealth SR
(11 with peer-reviewed funding). Since inception the mHealth SR has provided its technical services and
expertise to 72 mHealth research studies (38 NIH-funded) with an additional ~30 grant proposals currently
under review at federal granting agencies. Most of these studies have focused on cancer prevention, but there
has been a recent increase in studies designed for patients currently receiving cancer treatments (n=9). Thus,
there is growing need and interest among SCC members to employ mobile applications to advance their
research. The use of this resource will continue to accelerate throughout the next funding cycle."
10838604,"BIOSTATISTICS AND RESEARCH DESIGN SHARED RESOURCE: ABSTRACT
The Biostatistics and Research Design Shared Resource (BRD SR) plays a critical role in research activities at
the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) through supporting biostatistical and research design needs for SCC
members. The BRD SR is directed by Sara Vesely, PhD (CPC) and co-directed by Daniel Zhao, PhD (CT),
and has seven PhD-level faculty and six staff. The BRD SR provides biostatistical and research design
assistance for a variety of projects, including basic science experiments, meta-analyses, secondary data
analysis, genetic data and bioinformatics analysis, observational studies, qualitative studies, community
research, pilot trials, randomized clinical trials, and phase I investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Major consultative
services provided by BRD SR faculty include assistance with refining aims and outcomes, appropriate study
design selection, data collection planning, development of statistical analysis and data monitoring plans,
creation of random allocation schemes, sample size calculations, and grant preparation.
The BRD SR is a cost-efficient resource to assist SCC members in a timely manner, free of direct charge,
through project conception, development, grant writing, implementation, analysis, and manuscript writing.
Services can be accessed online via the SCC / BRD SR webpages, with an online service request form. BRD
SR faculty and staff have a diverse set of expertise, including database creation and management, research
design, biostatistical analysis, statistical genetics analysis, geo-spatial methods, sampling strategies and
weighting, data monitoring, and grant writing. In 2021, 57 total SCC members utilized the BRD SR, accounting
for 73% of BRD SR usage. SCC members with peer-reviewed support (n=41) accounted for 53% of the total
usage. In 2021, the BRD SR supported over 140 cancer-focused SCC projects (ongoing grants, IITs, and other
projects) and 105 grant submissions (submissions and resubmissions). From 2017 to 2021, the BRD SR
provided biostatistical consultation services to 80 full and associate members across all three SCC programs.
The number of SCC member users has steadily increased each year – 36 (2017), 44 (2018), 46 (2019), 50
(2020), 57 (2021) – a 58% increase in annual SR usage from the beginning to the end of the reporting period.
Future plans are focused on the addition of faculty (2-4) and staff (2-4) biostatisticians over the next five years,
expertise to be determined by SCC strategic growth and needs, and to be recruited in partnership with the
Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology."
10840303,"Interspecies interactions are the foundation of bacterial community formation and function. Through their
interactions, bacteria exert powerful influences on human health as commensal microflora, pathogens,
biofilms, and antibiotic producers. A prevalent form of interaction among bacterial species relies on the
exchange of specialized metabolites. Commonly represented by antibiotics, these bioactive metabolites
function in myriad ways to promote the fitness of the producing species. Specialized metabolites may be toxic
or growth inhibitory, or alternatively, they may function as signals and cues to relay information between
species in a microbial community. Despite their importance for interactions between species, there is little
understanding of the mechanisms that bacteria use to sense and respond to foreign specialized metabolites.
This project focuses on an early-warning system for competitors, wherein bacteria detect specialized
metabolites from other species and respond by activating a surface-mobile population. This example of an
adaptive physiological response to a competitor provides the bacteria an opportunity to either escape or to
counterattack. This project has two specific aims. The first aim is to define the mechanisms that activate and
control bacterial motility when bacteria are exposed to specialized metabolites from a competitor. In particular,
this aim will focus on major changes in metabolism and the controlling genetic functions that support a
transition to a mobilized population. The second aim is to identify new motility-inducing metabolites produced
by competing bacteria. Previously identified inducers are protein synthesis inhibitors that stimulate motility at
subinhibitory concentrations. New inducers of unknown structure will be identified from different strains of
bacteria. These inducers will expand knowledge of chemical forms that induce surface mobilization and will
function as chemical probes to understand the pathways to activating the mobile response. Because inducers
include protein synthesis inhibitors, new candidate antibiotics may be identified among the target specialized
metabolites. Overall, these studies will advance understanding of specialized metabolism in dynamic
interactions between bacterial species and how a mobile response promotes competitive fitness."
10896128,"Project Summary/Abstract
This application seeks funding for a new Interdisciplinary Predoctoral Training Program in Quantitative
Mechanobiology at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The Program brings biologists, physicists,
and engineers together to pursue fundamental understanding of the biophysical principles underlying human
health spanning molecular to organismal level processes of mechanosignaling in development, homeostasis
and disease. The focus of this initiative is cross-disciplinary training in mechanobiology, i.e., relationships
between physical forces and biological structure and function, to produce a new cadre of bioscientists who will
develop quantitative solutions to biology’s most challenging problems. If funded, the Training Program in
Quantitative Mechanobiology will be UCSB’s first training grant and will serve as a flagship predoctoral training
program that nucleates a connected community across the many labs already conducting mechanobiology
research at UCSB through peer-to-peer interactions, cross-lab training, seminars, courses, and an annual
symposium/retreat. The Program will provide support for Fellows to undertake three research rotations in their
first year and opportunities for unique cross-training in mechanobiology. Each year, six Mechanobiology
Fellows will be admitted with a steady state Program size of twelve predoctoral training slots. The Program will
recruit and support Fellows from six graduate degree programs and augment their PhD programs with training
in quantitative bioscience methods, engineering models and devices, and multi-disciplinary cross-training to
develop and apply quantitative approaches to problems in mechanobiology. To provide optimal interdisciplinary
mentorship and research training experiences, each Fellow will work with their project PI and will also be
assigned a Program Mentor with complementary seniority, quantitative, experimental, and analytical
approaches. The Program Mentor will also serve on the Fellow’s dissertation committee. This chain of
mentorship is supported by formal Mentor trainings and leverages our mix of junior and senior Faculty Mentors
to support both our Fellows and our junior Faculty Mentors. Fellows will benefit from formalized interactions
with the diverse community of faculty and peers, as well as resources, associated with Program and affiliated
graduate programs. Key components of the Program include formalized training in Responsible Conduct of
Research, Quantitative Experiments, didactic and hands-on training in methods and analytical techniques in a
Mechanobiology Methods course and quarterly “open door” lab sessions in Faculty Mentor labs. The Program
will feature monthly seminars with peers, visiting researchers, and Faculty Mentors as well as career
development activities, and an annual symposium/retreat uniting the entire UCSB mechanobiology community.
Trainees from diverse disciplines, backgrounds, and groups will be prepared to lead rigorous biomedical
research programs and promote scientific advances in academia, industry, national labs, and technology and
policy careers."
10860948,"A critical characteristic of human language is our ability to understand multi-word sequences whose
meaning is greater than the sum of their parts. Recent work from the PIs of this proposal (Toneva and Wehbe,
2019; Jain and Huth, 2018) and others (Schrimpf et al., 2020a; Caucheteux & King, 2020) has shown that
cortical representations of multi-word sequences can be modeled much more accurately than before by
using neural network language models, a machine learning technique that has revolutionized the natural
language processing (NLP) field (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). However, under the current
paradigm these models must first be trained on separate NLP tasks and only then used to model the brain,
creating a guess-and-check cycle that is not guaranteed to converge on the actual computations that
humans perform. Here we propose to break this cycle by directly training neural network models to
estimate the functions that the brain uses to combine words. To be able to optimally predict fMRI and MEG
responses, these models will need to capture the composition principles governing which words the brain
attends to, and how information is combined across words. These models will help uncover specific
computations underlying language processing in the brain, enable computational testing of neurolinguistic
theories, and inspire or directly improve models used in NLP.
 Accomplishing these goals, however, will require overcoming one major obstacle. Training neural net-
work language models typically requires orders of magnitude more data than existing neuroimaging
datasets. To address this issue, one central goal of this proposed project is to collect a very large fMRI and
MEG dataset comprising roughly one million words of natural language stimuli. We plan to use the unique
dataset and computational modeling framework to address three scientific aims.
Aim 1: Create brain activity prediction benchmarks to foster interaction between neuroscience and NLP.
Aim 2: Use data-driven models to test existing neurolinguistic theories & develop new accounts of the
computations underlying word composition in the brain. Aim 3: Leverage information in different brain
areas to help solve computationally defined language tasks.
 Successful completion of the proposed work will provide mechanistic insight into language processing,
with a computational architecture tracing information flow among brain areas and describing the tasks they
perform. Beyond its basic cognitive neuroscience implications, we expect this work will enable better
understanding of language impairments and help identify targeted therapies.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Through collecting, analyzing, and disseminating large-scale neuroimaging datasets collected while
participants listen to natural, narrative speech, this proposal aims to improve our understanding of the
normal function of the language system. Specifically, this work seeks to improve and validate
computational models of speech language processing in the human brain."
10844504,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hearing loss is a chronic condition prevalent in two-thirds of adults >70 years and may be a potentially
modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes including dementia. However, uptake and sustained use of
hearing aids in adults is low, with <20% of older adults with hearing loss reporting use, among whom up to 30-
40% may discontinue hearing aid use over time. These limitations may stem in part from the reliance of the
current best-practice model of hearing healthcare (HHC) on clinic-based visits that requires multiple in-person
sessions between an audiologist and a patient for all ongoing technical and self-management support services.
Incorporation of asynchronous and synchronous telehealth into HHC to complement clinic-based visits would
allow for routine troubleshooting of communication challenges, hearing aid technical issues, and reinforcement
of self-management support strategies. Determining if a HHC model that incorporates audiological telehealth
improves long-term hearing aid use and other patient-centered outcome measures has direct implications for
both future clinical care standards and ongoing Medicare legislative bills pertaining to HHC coverage. Our
interdisciplinary consortium of investigators has a singular opportunity to evaluate the potential benefits of a
telehealth audiology model on long-term hearing aid use and other outcomes in a large cohort of racially-
diverse, community-dwelling older adults who are existing hearing aid users. In the ongoing Aging & Cognitive
Health Evaluation in Elders (ACHIEVE) randomized trial, we recruited 977 adults ages 70-84 with untreated
mild-to-moderate hearing loss from January 2018 to October 2019 who were randomized 1:1 to a hearing
intervention (i.e., conventional clinic-based delivery of hearing services and technologies) versus a successful
aging education control intervention. Participants are now being followed for 3 years post-randomization at the
four ACHIEVE field sites, and the goal of this NIA-funded multisite trial (R01AG055426) is to determine if
hearing loss treatment versus an aging education control intervention reduces cognitive decline. From 2021-
2022, as participants in the hearing intervention group (n=490) complete their pre-specified three years of
follow-up in the ACHIEVE trial, we propose to recruit these existing hearing aid users and randomize them to
receive either continued conventional clinic-based delivery of hearing care services or a model that
incorporates telehealth. At 1 year post-randomization, the primary outcome (hours of hearing aid use) will be
contrasted between the two groups, and participants in the conventional HHC arm will then cross-over and
also receive telehealth HHC. All participants will continue to be followed for 2 years post-randomization. Aim 1:
To compare the effect of the telehealth versus conventional HHC delivery model on hours of hearing aid use
(primary outcome) and other patient-centered hearing and communication outcomes at 1 year post-
randomization. Aim 2: To compare the effect of the telehealth versus the conventional HHC delivery model on
secondary outcomes of social, mental, physical, and cognitive functioning at 1 year post-randomization."

10838565,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: ABSTRACT
Developmental funds from a variety of sources (e.g., CCSG, other sponsored research, institution, state,
philanthropy, etc.) enable the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) to pursue new research innovation and
collaboration. They help advance the SCC’s overall mission and strategic goals as well as provide support for
program leaders to achieve targeted scientific goals. Essential activities supported by developmental funds
include: intramural grant programs, recruitment of new investigators, career development for early-stage
investigators, and new shared resource development. These help advance the SCC’s core strategic priorities:
1) enhancing breadth, depth and impact of cancer-focused research; 2) fostering the translation of discoveries
into the clinical or community setting; 3) designing and conducting hypothesis-driven trials to improve
outcomes for people with or at risk for cancer; 4) promoting intra- and inter-programmatic collaboration and
transdisciplinary team science; 5) enhancing COE to address priority cancers and cancer problems prevalent
in the SCC catchment area; 6) increasing training and mentorship opportunities for students and faculty; and 7)
enhancing the presence of underrepresented minority (URM) persons and women among SCC leadership and
membership, and in pipeline programs. All decisions concerning the allocation of developmental funds
ultimately rest with the SCC director, who meets with the center’s research leadership team biweekly to
discuss new research opportunities and allocation of developmental funds in the form of intramural grants,
recruitment, investments in new technologies, and targeted funding to pursue new strategically driven
initiatives.
The SCC has utilized developmental funds awarded through intramural grant programs to stimulate new
research, enhance transdisciplinary collaboration, support career development, and address priority cancers
and cancer problems prevalent in the SCC catchment area. During the reporting period (CY2017-21), the SCC
awarded 85 intramural grants through a variety of programs, with a total award amount of $3,053,349. As of
12/31/21, these grants have resulted in 71 peer-reviewed publications and $10,246,254 (total, direct cost) in
extramural sponsored research funding. Notably, 21 of these 85 were awarded through grant programs newly
established since 2020; thus, they are just completing first funding cycles and are still pending outcomes. In
addition, developmental funds have been used to recruit 31 new cancer-focused investigators to the SCC (both
the OUHSC and OU Norman campuses) over the past five years, significantly enhancing transdisciplinary
expertise and the potential for team science among the SCC’s three programs. Notably, five (16%) of these
new recruits are URM individuals and more than half (n=16) are female."
10838571,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION: ABSTRACT
The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) conducts formal planning and evaluation activities, under the oversight
of the SCC director and senior leadership team, to advance its mission of eliminating cancer in Oklahoma
(SCC catchment area) and beyond. Planning and evaluation are critically important for a matrix cancer center
like the SCC to ensure optimal coordination, integration, and effectiveness of SCC activities and resource
allocation. The following core strategic priorities inform the goals, tactics, and metrics for all SCC research
components: 1) enhancing breadth, depth, and impact of cancer-focused research; 2) fostering the translation
of discoveries into the clinical or community setting; 3) designing and conducting hypothesis-driven trials to
improve outcomes for people with or at risk for cancer; 4) promoting intra- and inter-programmatic collaboration
and transdisciplinary team science; 5) enhancing COE to address priority cancers and cancer problems
prevalent in the SCC catchment area; 6) increasing training and mentorship opportunities for students and
faculty; and 7) enhancing the presence of underrepresented minority persons and women among SCC
leadership and membership, and in pipeline programs. For oversight, planning, and evaluation of research
activities, SCC Director Robert Mannel, MD has assembled an experienced senior leadership team of
associate directors (ADs) who oversee the following functions: basic research (Danny Dhanasekaran, PhD);
translational research (Priyabrata Mukherjee, PhD); clinical research (Kathleen Moore, MD); community
outreach and engagement (Mark Doescher, MD); education, training, and career enhancement (Rajagopal
Ramesh, PhD); diversity, equity, and inclusion (Joan Walker, MD); and research administration (Wade
Williams, PhD).
Since Mannel’s appointment as SCC director in 2006, strategic planning and evaluation has played a central
role in the development of the SCC. The standing Research Leadership Committee (RLC) and Research
Steering Committee (RSC), which are comprised of leaders for all research components at the SCC, provide
regular forums for planning and evaluating progress. In addition, research leadership is well represented in
SCC clinical planning and evaluation. External input from scientific and community advisory boards augment
these planning and evaluation activities. New strategic initiatives emerging from planning discussions during
the reporting period include: research program realignment (2018); strategic partnerships with the Oklahoma
Center for Geroscience (2018) and Harold Hamm Diabetes Center (2019); new initiatives to enhance SCC
research focused on catchment area priority cancers and prevalent cancer problems (2019); increased
engagement with OU Norman to foster cancer-focused research and collaborations (2020); establishing a new
AD position for diversity, equity, and inclusion, and broad planning for how to enhance DEI among SCC
leadership and membership, and in pipeline education programs (2021)."
10838575,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) function provides comprehensive management and
support services for clinical research activities at the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). CPDM services reside
in the SCC’s Clinical Trials Office (CTO), which is comprised of ~200 FTEs and is under the direction of
Kathleen Moore, MD (CT), the SCC Associate Director for Clinical Research. The CTO provides centralized
and integrated research support services to all SCC members and clinical programs, including comprehensive
regulatory support, data management, research coordination embedded in disease-site clinical programs,
bioinformatics, quality assurance (auditing and data integrity), finance, and biospecimen acquisition and
coordination. For investigator-initiated trials (IITs), a Protocol Support Unit (PSU) provides comprehensive
support from protocol conception to activation, registration of new trials, and results reporting with
ClinicalTrials.gov. The CTO supports a Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and written DSM Plan
(approved by NCI). In addition, it works to ensure accrual to trials by women and children as well as minorities
and other individuals in the SCC catchment area historically underrepresented in clinical research. During this
grant cycle, several new initiatives were launched to enhance CTO functions, including: 1) implementation of a
new CTMS (OnCore) expected to complete in Q3 2022; 2) creation and staffing of a strategic initiative and
project management team; 3) creation and staffing of a new Education and Training team and a new Serious
Adverse Event (SAE) team; and 4) expansion of the Quality Assurance team and the IIT PSU. In addition, CTO
developed a clinical research component for the SCC’s new cellular therapies program inclusive of inpatient
research support.
Between 2017 and 2021, the CTO oversaw the recruitment, management and reporting of 11,121 individuals
into all clinical research studies being conducted within SCC (3,095 interventional treatment, 4,216
interventional non-treatment, 3,810 non-interventional). During this time it facilitated the activation of 524
studies, including 71 institutional and externally peer-reviewed interventional studies. This represents a 100%
increase in IITs (interventional) from 2017 to 2021 and a concomitant 40% increase in accruals to
interventional IITs between 2017 and 2021. Further, due to intentional outreach to the AI community the
percentage of AI enrolled to interventional trials increased from 4.4% to 6.2% across the grant cycle."
10838578,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM: ABSTRACT
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees all cancer-related clinical research at the
Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) to ensure that it is of the highest scientific merit, adheres to the strategic
priorities of the SCC, demonstrates ongoing progress, and efficiently utilizes SCC resources. The PRMS
conducts protocol review in a two-stage process, with Stage One involving Disease Groups (DGs) and a
Feasibility Review Committee (FRC) and Stage Two involving the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee
(PRMC) for a separate, independent review. PRMS coordinators support investigators and committee
members in navigating the two required stages of review for all applicable studies. Studies approved by the
PRMC are monitored throughout the lifecycle of the study.
Independent Disease Groups (DGs) review new concepts and protocols to assess scientific merit, availability
of the relevant patient population, overlap with potentially competing trials, and whether protocols align with
and advance DG- and SCC-based goals. DGs assign a priority score to each study utilizing a Prioritization
Schema that reflects the overall research priorities of the SCC. This discussion tool guides the evaluation of
new protocols to assess the availability of patients and estimate the number of local patients anticipated based
on SCC’s patient population. In 2021, DGs reviewed 286 new protocols; 126 (44%) were not approved to
continue to the PRMC.
The SCC’s PRMC is chaired by Adam Asch, MD (CT) and co-chaired by Melissa Craft, BSN, MS CNS, PhD
(CPC affiliate). PRMC membership includes broad representation from multiple disciplines engaged in cancer
clinical research. Its 18 voting members are selected based on their disciplinary-specific knowledge,
experience in design and conduct of research studies, and/or specialized clinical expertise. Depending on trial
type, the PRMC performs either an expedited Administrative Review or Full Committee Review. If the latter, at
least two reviewers from the PRMC voting members are assigned to the protocol. A protocol is approved with a
majority vote of a quorum of members. PRMC review occurs prior to submission to the Institutional Review
Board (IRB), and per institutional policy the latter will not review cancer-related protocols until approved by the
PRMC. In 2021, the PRMC reviewed 145 new protocols (128 approved, 9 approved with revision, 4 tabled and
4 disapproved). The PRMC also monitors active protocols annually for ongoing accrual and has the authority to
close protocols that do not demonstrate adequate scientific progress. In 2021, the PRMC reviewed 514 active
protocols for accrual progress. Of these, 335 were approved to continue, 168 were required to submit Accrual
Enhancement Plans, and 11 were closed."
10838584,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
Four shared resources (SRs) at the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) provide cancer center members with
access to specialized technologies, services, and technical expertise, with the intent to enhance scientific
interaction, productivity, and impact as well as support community outreach and engagement (COE) and
training and mentorship initiatives. The SRs are: Biostatistics and Research Design (BRD SR), Tissue
Pathology and Biospecimen (TPB SR), Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research (MBCR SR) and Mobile
Health Technology (mHealth SR). Three of these facilities (BRD SR, TPB SR, mHealth SR) are SCC-
managed. The fourth (MBCR SR) is institutionally managed and is the centralized core facility for the OUHSC
campus (thus offering a wide range of specialized services and scientific equipment). These shared resources
are located on the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) campus. The two laboratory-
based shared resources (TPB SR, MBCR SR) are in the research complex that houses 52 of the 63 total
laboratory-based SCC members at OUHSC, providing these members with immediate access to core services.
The mHealth SR is in space that houses all the repeat frequent users of this resource (CPC program members
who conduct behavioral and population research). Ease of access for the SCC’s 15 members based at OU
Norman (out of 120 total SCC members) is facilitated by online scheduling through dedicated shared resource
webpages and utilizing research management systems (Agilent iLab, REDCap, other).
A defined oversight and management structure and centralized processes help ensure the ongoing stability,
reliability, accessibility, and quality control for the SCC’s shared resource infrastructure. Oversight for the
management of shared resources is provided by the SCC’s Research Leadership Committee (RLC), which is
comprised of the SCC director and associate directors (ADs). All SCC shared resource directors report to a
designated SCC AD. The SCC director has ultimate oversight and authority for all shared resources and other
core research infrastructure at the cancer center. The SCC’s Administrative Core provides coordinating
support for all shared resources, assisting with usage and capacity reporting, finance and billing,
communications, evaluation, and other administrative activities. During the reporting period, there were two
significant changes to SCC shared resources: 1) Ken Jones, PhD was recruited as new director of the MBCR
SR; and 2) a formal biospecimen aim was added to the overall specific aims of TPB SR. The latter responds to
a summary statement critique and serves to formalize the facility’s biospecimen services available to SCC
members. In recognition of this change the name of the Tissue Pathology Shared Resource was formally
changed to “Tissue Pathology and Biospecimen.”"
10838590,"MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND CYTOMETRY RESEARCH SHARED RESOURCE: ABSTRACT
The Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research Shared Resource (MBCR SR) is an institutionally managed
central core facility that assists investigators in all aspects of research, including initial project consultation,
assistance with experimental design, training in protocols and instrumentation usage, sample preparation, data
collection and assistance with analysis and interpretation of results. Under the direction of Ken Jones, PhD,
the MBCR SR provides six important core services to Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) members and other
investigators: 1) the DNA Sequencing and Genomics Core provides high-fidelity, next-generation nucleic acid
sequencing data; 2) the Proteomics Core provides support for biomolecule identification, including complex
proteomics analysis, post-translational modification identification, high-resolution molecular weight

protein identification by proteolytic digest (in-gel or in solution), nano LC/MS/MS and database search, and
peptide sequencing; 3) the Flow Cytometry and Imaging Core provides flow cytometry and microscopy support
for subcellular studies on protein expression, cell cycle and cell signaling; 4) the Cancer Functional Genomics
Core provides high-throughput live cell functional characterization of cancer cells, including reverse proteomics
array establishment, absolute gene quantification and copy number determination, nucleic acid and protein
electrophoresis and imaging, multimodal screening for high-throughput assay on plates, high-throughput, high-
content screening of subcellular localized proteins in cells, metabolic analysis of live cells and quantification of
clonogenic assay colonies of cancer cells; 5) the Bioinformatics Core provides advanced computational
analyses of multi-omic data (Genomic, Proteomic, Metabolomic), and 6) the Mass Spectrometry Core is a
nascent core initiated in 2021 as an institutional core specializing in metabolite and small molecule analysis
using state-of-the-art mass spectroscopy. This SR has been successful in obtaining funds to purchase
metabolomic mass specs for de novo discovery and targeted analysis. The MBCR SR is located in the Stanton
L. Young Biomedical Research Center (BRC) on the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC)
campus. This central location provides convenient access to the MBCR SR for the SCC’s laboratory-based
members (37 members in BRC, 15 members in the adjacent Biomedical Sciences Building). During the
reporting period, 78 full and associate SCC members utilized this facility, with 69 (88%) of these having peer-
reviewed grant support. Since this is an institutionally managed core that supports the entire OUHSC campus,
it is important to note that full and associate SCC members (n=78) accounted for over a third (35%) of the total
users of this centralized facility (n=222). SCC affiliate members (non-CCSG members) accounted for another
27 (12%) of total usage. Combined, these cancer focused members account for by far the largest number and
percentage usage by any department or center at OUHSC."

 Studies in rodents have fundamentally advanced our understanding of pancreatic islet cell
development and function, but limitations of rodent models for understanding human pancreas
formation and disease have intensified interest in experimental systems that more closely reflect
human pancreas development and islet function. Our studies have revealed advantages for
investigating islet development in pigs, including evidence for multiple conserved features of
islet development in pigs and humans, not observed in mice. This includes expression of
transcription factors like SIX2 and SIX3 which govern hallmark features of human islet β cell fate
and function. We have developed a reliable framework for procuring pig pancreata and islets
from any developmental stage, and described molecular, cellular, signaling and genetic features
of developing pig α, β, and δ cells from fetal to neo-natal stages, including the first detailed
developmental transcriptome of these cells. In addition, our team has generated some of the
first gene-edited pigs using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting. These advances motivate the following
Aims:
Aim 1. Elucidate the genetic architecture of pig islet cell development and functional maturation
Aim 2. Identify native regulators of pig islet SIX2 and SIX3 expression
Aim 3. Investigate phenotypes of HNF1A heterozygous mutation in pigs
To achieve our aims, we assembled a superb team of collaborating investigators with
complementary expertise in developmental biology, pig genetics, islet biology, genomics and
diabetes research. This work should allow previously unattainable investigation of genetic and
physiological mechanisms regulating pig islet cells. This includes identification of regulatory
features that connect chromatin dynamics and gene transcription to control islet α, β and δ cell
fate and function, and creation of new models of MODY that better recapitulate human disease
genetics, pathogenesis and therapeutics. Our work should create new flexible experimental
paradigms to investigate development and functional maturation of islet cells from physiological
and pathological stages, a striking advantage that broadens the impact of our proposal on
human health."
10844493,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the United States, voice disorders affect approximately 30% of the adult population at some point in their lives,
with about 25 million individuals suffering at any given point in time. The impact of living with a voice disorder is
far-reaching, and the societal burden reaches up to $13.5 billion dollars each year due to work-related disability,
lost productivity, and direct healthcare costs. Individuals with voice disorders often suffer from heightened
sensations of vocal effort and fatigue while speaking that are typically attributed to inefficient vocal function and
behavior. Increasing vocal efficiency and decreasing vocal effort and associated vocal fatigue are often goals of
clinical treatment paradigms. Thus, vocal efficiency is a highly desirable objective measure for the clinical
management of voice disorders, particularly if it can be obtained via ambulatory monitoring to track vocal health
and vocal behavior in a patient’s natural environment.
The proposed project seeks to develop an index of ambulatory vocal efficiency that integrates estimates of
subglottal pressure and vocal sound pressure level to monitor the vocal effort of patients being treated for
phonotraumatic vocal cord lesions, non-phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction, and unilateral vocal fold paralysis.
Individuals with healthy vocal status will also be monitored as control subjects matched for sex, age, and
occupational/vocal demands. An innovative wearable sensor technology using flexible circuits obtains
synchronized data from a wireless neck-surface accelerometer and microphone to track the index of ambulatory
vocal efficiency in real-world settings. Integrating the technology into a smartphone platform enables periodic
prompting to prompt subjects to rate their level of vocal effort on a visual analog scale. The proposed work
pursues critical goals of (a) investigating the clinical validity of the ambulatory vocal efficiency index in patients
with voice disorders and vocally healthy matched controls and (b) assessing the ambulatory vocal efficiency
index as an objective correlate of self-ratings of vocal effort. The impact of this work is significant because, for
the first time, voice clinicians will be able to monitor vocal efficiency in naturalistic, real-world settings to improve
the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of voice disorders."

The overarching goal of this R01 is to test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention for heavy episodic drinking
(HED) and sexual assault among college students. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) students experience
sexual assault and engage in HED at even higher rates than their cisgender, heterosexual peers. Therefore,
tailored and personalized interventions are needed for HED and sexual assault to address the unique needs of
college students based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The Alcohol and Sexual Assault Prevention
(ASAP) program was developed by the research team with an NIAAA-funded planning grant (R34) and is the
only intervention that targets both HED and sexual assault (victimization risk reduction, perpetration
prevention, and bystander intervention training) in an integrated manner. ASAP provides tailored content on
alcohol use and sexual assault based on gender identity and sexual orientation using a social norms and
personalized feedback approach. Usability testing and findings from a randomized controlled pilot feasibility
trial suggest usability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy and warrant rigorous randomized controlled trial
testing. ASAP is delivered in a brief, web-based format, and although short-term outcomes are promising,
more effort is needed to ensure long-term efficacy. Therefore, the current study includes an assessment of
ASAP as well as an innovative assessment of a 6-month booster (ASAP+Booster) session to determine the
most effective way to disseminate ASAP to colleges nationwide if found to be effective. The current study
includes the following aims: 1a) to test the efficacy of ASAP and ASAP+Booster among college students in
reducing HED and sexual assault both short- and long-term among three risk groups (1. cisgender
heterosexual men; 2. cisgender heterosexual women; 3. SGM); 1b) Test the relative efficacy of a booster
session on long-term alcohol use and SA outcomes; and 2) Investigate the mechanisms through which ASAP
conditions impact alcohol use and SA. Outcomes will be assessed at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-
intervention. By accomplishing these aims, we will assess the efficacy of ASAP, a promising intervention
developed by the research team. ASAP has the potential to reduce alcohol use among young adults as well as
reduce college SA and includes a focus on SGM populations, addressing NIAAA and public health priorities."
10816409,"Approximately 27% of the 52 million K-12 school-age children (5-18 years) in the United
States experience at least one chronic medical condition (CCMC) requiring them to receive
medication during the school day. Adherence to the medications and their scheduled dosing is
crucial for the CCMC’s health and academic progress. However, primary schools are an
understudied community healthcare setting with school nurses (SNs) as the main healthcare
provider. Widespread budgetary cuts have left 18% of schools across the nation with no
designated SN,2,6 leaving the vast majority (78%) of medication administrations to unlicensed
assistive personnel (UAP). Because these individuals are not healthcare providers, medication
errors are three times higher when administered by UAP than by a SN. To reduce medication
errors in schools, we propose a technology-assisted system to help SNs and UAP with
medication administration and documentation. Our proposed computer-based system, the
Electronic School Medication Administration Record (eSMAR). Our system prototype was tried
in simulated environment. Therefore, the purpose of this demonstration project is to implement
eSMAR in a real-world setting (grade schools) and to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of
eSMAR on medication administration and documentation in schools.
Aim 1: Implement and evaluate the usability of eSMAR in a select sample of K-12 schools
in the Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD).
We will achieve this aim by analyzing data from a) usability surveys from SNs and UAP, b)
eSMAR system usage reports, c) observation, filed notes, and semi-structured interviews during
site visits, and c) parent satisfaction survey.
Aim 2: Understand contextual factors influencing eSMAR implementation.
We will achieve this aim by conducting site visits using rapid ethnographic assessment (REA).
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and EPIS domains will inform the
development of the REA measures. Data from Aims 1&2 will be triangulated to deepen our
understanding of contextual variables influencing eSMAR implementation.
Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of eSMAR (number of errors intercepted).
We will achieve this aim by analyzing data from the eSMAR reports for the number, type, and
frequency of errors intercepted by eSMAR. We will compare data on users (SNs vs. UAP), type
of medication, time, medical condition, child’s age and grade level. Data from ICCSD incident
reports will be collected to identify types of errors not prevented by the eSMAR system."

The Genomic Sciences Training Program (GSTP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is
building an inclusive community of leading genomic scientists with strengths spanning across
multiple disciplines. The training opportunities and environment we propose will enable our
trainees to create and rigorously apply new tools derived from technological advances that are
informed by cutting-edge statistical and computational approaches that functionalize diverse
and large datasets. The new genomic approaches to biological and medical investigation
demand scientists who are knowledgeable and skilled across several fields in effective ways that
potentiate new insights or inventions. Accordingly, the emergence of new tools allowing for the
creation and interpretation of large-scale experimental efforts is what GSTP has focused on by
the didactical interweaving of investigative approaches drawn from multiple fields (biology,
genetics, physical sciences, engineering, computer science, and statistics) that were
individually contoured for complementing a trainee’s core disciplinary focus, yet built upon
achievement and knowledge within the genomic sciences. Given the incredibly rich scientific and
engineering breadth of the University of Wisconsin, GSTP has been able to recruit outstanding
trainees who greatly advanced mass spectrometry, “omic”-integration, computation, genome
engineering, and bio-devices, while exploring new applications leveraging these advantages for
cutting-edge investigation into network genomics, proteomics, spatial genomics, metabolomics,
and genome biology. These achievements and contributions have nucleated and grown a
significant genomics community. This genomics community has become a gateway and
central hub for groundbreaking collaborations reaching across departments, centers, schools
and other training programs. We propose for the upcoming project period that we continue this
focus, with continued emphasis on innovation/invention and fostering of clinical applications,
which will advance translational genomics and “turn discoveries into health.” We request funding
for 10 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral traineeships per year. In the next funding period, we will
continue to recruit and train trainees who have recently completed their undergraduate or
graduate degrees."
10843192,"This is a new application for continued support of a unique, vibrant, multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary pre-
doctoral training program entitled “Biomechanics in Regenerative Medicine (BiRM)” jointly run by the
Departments of Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh and Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon
University. For the past 16 years, 38 trainees have gained a solid foundation that has led to independent careers
in academia (n=10), industry (n=24), and government (n=4) with an additional seven (7) trainees currently
enrolled. BiRM is an innovative training program with an in depth focus on multi-scale biomechanics as applied
to regenerative medicine for the development or repair of tissues (and organs?) whose primary physiological
function is mechanical. As the field of regenerative medicine matures, it is necessary to arm the next generation
engineering workforce with a deeper understanding of multi-scale biomechanics, the relationship between
biomechanics and growth and remodeling (mechanobiology), and the biological basis of repair and regeneration.
To accomplish these, we will also hone our trainees with skills in contemporary engineering technologies (e.g.,
artificial intelligence (AI), mechatronics, robotics, computation, process control, and manufacturing). BiRM
leverages the didactic and research experiences of distinct strengths and resources of two major universities
plus clinical experience of a World-class medical center all located adjacent to one another without administrative
roadblocks in conventional cross-institutional programs.
Trainee candidates are primarily from bioengineering, but we also welcome those from other disciplines. Another
unique aspect of BiRM is the significant clinical exposure for trainees (including a mandatory clinical mentor) to
aid in appreciation of the enormous potential, opportunity, and challenge of translating regenerative medicine
technologies. Similarly, challenges and opportunities in biomanufacturing and large-scale production of
regenerative medicine technologies will be imparted to the trainees with our unique partnership with the
Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute. Professional and career development are offered, including
innovation and entrepreneurship.
In the next five years, we aim to maintain 6 pre-doctoral fellowships per year. Our multi-institutional program will
provide a unique opportunity for our trainees to 1) develop key collaborative and multidisciplinary skills on multi-
scale biomechanics, 2) to prepare them to enter the future regenerative medicine workforce as the field moves
from conception to reality, and 3) to become innovators in upstream research and downstream production for
the next generation of technologies."
10825565,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Human chromosomes serve to compact the genomic DNA several thousand times its length to fit within the
cell’s nucleus, while also allowing for processes such as and gene expression. To accomplish this, the
genome is assembled into a complicated, multifaceted complex known as chromatin. The assembly of
chromatin first involves wrapping short (~200 bp) segments around spools of protein comprised of core
histone into structures known as nucleosomes. Immensely long, genome-sized strings of nucleosomes are
assembled into large structures via to the self-interacting nature of nucleosomes. The key elements in
formation of these large condensed structures are the ‘tail’ domains of the core histone proteins, which
protrude out from the main body of nucleosomes to mediate inter-nucleosome interactions. However,
despite their essential nature to the formation of chromosomes, little is actually known about how the
histone tail domains contact neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, these interactions represent critical
points for regulation, and are modified by epigenetic posttranslational modifications, including acetylation,
as well as other chromatin modifiers. This project will employ biochemical and biophysical techniques to
define critical molecular aspects of the inter-nucleosome interactions mediated by the core histone tail
domains in model systems, and elucidate how epigenetic modifications within the tail domains regulate
these interactions. The specific goals of the work described in this proposal are to: 1) define inter-
nucleosome interactions mediated by the core histone tail domains, and how posttranslational
modifications transition inactive chromatin structures to those hospitable to active genes in a model
chromatin system; 2) define aspects of how linker histones bind to nucleosomes, and oligonucleosome
arrays, are affected by posttranslational modifications, and communicate the core histone tail domains; and
3) understand how the HMGN chromatin architectural factors influence H1 structure to destabilize
chromatin condensates In addition, we will use lessons learned from the above work to understand the
molecular basis a newly identified mutation in a linker histone that causes the genetic disorder known as
Rahman’s disease. These results will fill in key knowledge gaps in our understanding of how
chromosomes are assembled, and regulated to provide for transcription, replication, DNA repair, and other
genome-related processes."

 Modern drug discovery and development require the training of scientists who understand the
molecular, physiological and quantitative basis of drug action and specificity, and who can apply modern
technologies and concepts to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This multidisciplinary doctoral
training program in the Pharmacological Sciences is designed to help meet that demand by preparing students
for biomedical research careers in schools of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, in research institutes, and in
governmental or industrial laboratories. The most important component of training is laboratory research, first
as a series of research rotations, then in the dissertation laboratory. This training is complemented by core
courses in pharmacology that emphasize quantitative analysis of drug action, pharmacokinetics, drug
disposition, biostatistics and experimental design, in addition to ethics training, seminar courses, journal clubs,
and advanced courses in specialty areas. Emphasis throughout is placed on training in rigor and
reproducibility, professional development, research ethics, and the refinement of communication skills. The 54
training faculty members represent 16 basic science and clinical departments at Emory, thereby providing a
wealth of diverse research training opportunities. This is an application for a new program, which would
replace the current program that has successfully trained a diverse cohort of students for the biomedical
workforce over the past two decades. We plan to continue our track record of training success while also
introducing new and innovative aspects to the training together with evidence-based mechanisms to evaluate
both student and program outcomes. We are requesting 8 positions, with the typical duration of appointment
being 24 months. Graduates of this program will have acquired broad familiarity with pharmacology, deep
knowledge in the area of dissertation research, and the technical, communicative and analytical skills
necessary to succeed in the biomedical workforce. The research conducted by the trainees in this program will
advance our knowledge of disease processes and contribute to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies
that will benefit the health of our citizens. By preparing young scientists to contribute to and lead the nation’s
efforts in these areas, this training program will help to ensure that our ability to improve the nation’s health
remains strong in the future."

 This proposal is the third renewal application for support of the Pediatric Physician-Scientist T32
training program in the Department of Pediatrics (DOP) at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM).
Pediatric physician-scientists play a crucial role in advancing knowledge that improves child health. To meet
the ongoing national need to replenish the pediatric physician-scientist pipeline at the clinical post-postdoctoral
fellowship level, our program supports a mentored career development pathway for 4 Trainees per year
(typically for 2 years each) by leveraging a wealth of biomedical research resources across the WUSM
campus, the DOP and our Child Health Research Center (NICHD CHRCDA K12). For the past 20 years and
going forward, the long-term objective of this program is to develop Trainees who focus their research efforts
on pediatric disease-oriented biology by applying recent advances in the basic and translational sciences, such
as developmental biology, cell biology, immunology, genetics, multi-omics systems biology, and bioinformatics.
The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) a protected mentored research experience with a well-established
investigator across a wide range of disciplines related to child health within WUSM and the DOP, 2) obligatory
educational programs in laboratory management, scientific rigor, statistics, grantsmanship, responsible
conduct of research, and biomedical informatics, 3) individualized coursework based on the Trainees area of
investigation (e.g., genetics, cell biology, computational biology), 4) continuous feedback to the Trainee,
mentor and program leadership, and 5) a flexible environment that facilitates the development of Trainees who
are women and are under-represented minorities. The program, now 20 years old, has an excellent track
record by exceeding national benchmarks (15-year T to K conversion rate = 52%; this cycle = 57%), and will
ultimately close the knowledge gap between basic/translational scientists and pediatric clinicians. Gary A.
Silverman, M.D., Ph.D., and David Hunstad, M.D. again serve as the Program Director, and the Training
Director, respectively. Our Trainees will continue to utilize a vast array of institutionally funded, state-of-the-art
research core facilities that provide, for example, whole-genome/exome DNA sequencing, single-cell RNA
sequencing, induced pluripotent stem cells and organoids, bioinformatics, cryo-EM and other advanced
imaging, CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing and model animal development, to facilitate the study of pediatric
disease states. The long-term goals of this program are being realized as its Trainees contribute to our
understanding of development and childhood diseases for decades to come, while evolving into the next
generation of scientific leaders, role models, and mentors for subsequent generations of pediatric physician-
scientists."
10933390,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a debilitating lung disease affecting over 16
million Americans, experience a high burden of chronic symptoms. Patients with COPD and their caregivers
identify patients’ high burden of psychological distress (e.g., symptoms of depression and anxiety) as their top
palliative care priority. Psychological distress is also strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD.
Yet, patients with COPD rarely receive care for psychological distress. Family caregivers are uniquely
positioned to facilitate the delivery of palliative care interventions due to their longitudinal contact with the
patient and because social relationships provide direct health benefits and buffer against health stressors. A
critical evidence gap that prevents effective and efficient palliative care delivery is an understanding of how
palliative care interventions may best leverage these existing relationships to meet the dyad’s needs. This
application proposes a two-arm mechanistic randomized trial comparing the effect of the Coping Skills Training
(CST) program and a minimally enhanced usual care attention control arm on improving patients’ and
caregivers’ outcomes. Over 12 remotely delivered, weekly sessions, the patient-caregiver dyad learns and
practices coping skills tailored to COPD. CST’s content focuses on (1) improving patients’ abilities to cope with
stress and illness and (2) teaching caregivers both how to cope and how to be an effective coping skills coach.
In prior testing, CST improved patients’ psychological quality of life and functional abilities, yet the mechanisms
of action remain unknown and the prior study population did not reflect the health disparities populations most
affected by COPD. The primary objective of the proposed trial is to apply behavioral science theories to identify
key mechanisms through which the CST program reduces patients’ psychological distress through caregiver
support. The project will also assess heterogeneity in the efficacy of CST at reducing distress among patients
who differ by key characteristics and identify patient, caregiver, and contextual factors associated with program
uptake and completion, both emphasizing modifiable, structural barriers to participation and relevancy. A
stakeholder advisory committee will continue to collaborate with investigators. The trial will enroll 375 dyads of
outpatients with COPD experiencing psychological distress and their caregivers recruited from University of
Pennsylvania and Henry Ford Health Systems’ outpatient clinics that primarily serve patients identifying as
Black, low-income, and/or living in rural communities. The study will identify the novel mechanisms through
which a palliative care intervention that includes and leverages patients’ caregivers can reduce the burden of
chronic illness carried by the dyad. Completing this project will provide the knowledge necessary to refine and
(1) develop scalable palliative care interventions that optimally incorporate patients’ existing relationships and
social resources and (2) inform strategies to surmount subgroup-specific barriers to facilitate future
implementation, including addressing structural barriers to palliative care access that lead to health disparities."

Project Summary/Abstract
The Mississippi IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (MS INBRE) is a statewide network
dedicated to enhancing biomedical research at all institutions of higher education in Mississippi. The overall
goal of the network is to build the biomedical research workforce needed to address health disparities and
inequities in MS by improving leadership and capabilities. With this goal in mind, the MS INBRE has developed
its activities around three scientific themes that disproportionally impact Mississippians: cancer, infectious
diseases, and obesity. MS is ranked second lowest in the United States in terms of access to healthcare,
primarily owing to the state's small economy and historically low investment in health care infrastructure. This
is mirrored in MS's biomedical research infrastructure, which has lagged in comparison to other states. The
result is a vicious cycle in which it is more difficult to make improvements in health care equality and
availability. This makes investments, embodied by the MS INBRE program, key to improving the biomedical
infrastructure at partner institutions that will provide the education and training to underserved communities
who have historically suffered from severe health disparities. The following aims have been developed to
accomplish the overall goal of the MS INBRE: 1) Improve research capacity at Primarily Undergraduate
Institutes (PUIs) in Mississippi; 2) Build collaboration among academic scientists and community-based
organizations; and 3) Develop a skilled and diverse workforce in biomedical research and health-related
careers. At the completion of the proposed project, we will augment the competitiveness of Mississippi in
biomedical research by improving biomedical research infrastructure, enabling research at undergraduate
institutions and training of students that address the needs of Mississippians."
10839369,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how host mitochondrial health and homeostasis modulate
infectious disease outcomes. The overall objective of this application is to define the molecular contributions of
pathogen-induced mitochondrial damage and host mitochondrial mutations to innate immune outcomes during
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in macrophages ex vivo and in mouse models of human disease.
Because mitochondria are of bacterial ancestral origin, they release many of the same damage-associated mo-
lecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immune pathways during bacterial infection. In spite of their clear
potential to regulate innate immunity, the ability of mitochondrial DAMPs to skew innate immune responses
during infection remains understudied. Several lines of evidence strongly argue that mitochondrial homeostasis
is crucial for controlling mycobacterial infection outcomes. First, genome-wide association studies frequently
identify SNPs in mitochondrial-associated genes (e.g. LRRK2, TFAM, POLG) that confer susceptibility to myco-
bacterial infection. Second, mycobacterial infection itself has been shown to damage mitochondria and release
mitochondrial DAMPs that are associated with potent innate immune responses, including type I interferon ex-
pression, inflammasome activation, and inflammatory cell death. The central hypotheses of this application pre-
dict that (1) Mtb has evolved to damage mitochondria directly in order to enhance type I IFN expression and
induce pro-bacterial immune reprogramming and (2) mutations in leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) confer
mycobacterial susceptibility because they compromise mitochondria network stability and trigger excessive cell
death in Mtb-infected macrophages, which leads to hyperinflammation during Mtb infection in vivo. To fully ap-
preciate the biology at the mitochondrial-Mtb interface, one needs to consider both the host and the pathogen.
To this end, pathogen-focused Aim 1 of this proposal is designed to identify novel Mtb virulence factors that
disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis and link the release of mitochondrial DAMPs to type I interferon production in
Mtb-infected macrophages. Aim 2 shifts focus to the host and investigates the molecular mechanisms that drive
mitochondrial damage and inflammatory cell death pathways in macrophages that harbor a common human
mutation, Lrrk2G2019S. Lastly, Aim 3 will link these macrophage phenotypes to the hyperinflammatory phenotype
observed in Mtb-infected Lrrk2G2019S mice and determine whether drugging mitochondrial-associated factors like
LRRK2 can alter the outcome of Mtb infection. This project is significant because elucidating the role mitochon-
drial dysfunction plays in exacerbating tuberculosis disease enables the design of therapeutic interventions that
correct mitochondrial defects and balance skewed immune responses to improve patient outcomes. This ap-
proach is innovative because it challenges existing conceptual paradigms, employs sophisticated technologies
at the cutting-edge of Mtb research, and leverages the unique expertise of PIs on each side of the host-pathogen
interface."
10817762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) is a clinical treatment for infertile couples who want to achieve a
pregnancy. In ART, embryologists fertilize eggs retrieved from the patient or a donor, culture the resulting embryos
in vitro, and then transfer the selected embryo(s) to the mother's uterus. While ART is responsible for 1.9% of babies
born in the United States as of 2018, selecting which embryo to transfer is a signiﬁcant challenge. The difﬁculty
comes from the complexity of confounding factors and the lack of understanding of human pre-implantation
embryo development. Because of this difﬁculty, multiple embryos are often transferred to increases the potential of
success, resulting in multiple pregnancy rates of nearly 20%, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and medical
expenses to patients. The ideal is to transfer only a single embryo, but this necessitates the ability to select the
best embryo from a cohort. Here, we propose to create a clinical decision support system to improve embryo
selection in ART.
To this end, we will develop novel deep learning models for robust embryo feature extraction and interactive
data visualization methods for human-in-the-loop analysis. We will ﬁrst extract and analyze visual features from
routinely collected images of embryos. We will then combine these visual features with patients' electronic health
record (EHR) data to develop interpretable computation models that score embryos on their viability. We plan to
integrate our machine learning solutions into an easily accessible cloud service platform that will be adaptable
across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis.
Our research goals will be achieved by novel machine learning-based models for morphological feature extrac-
tion and importance estimation of each confounding factor and a clinical decision support system for ART. For
morphological feature extraction, we plan to conduct semi-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks
to minimize manual labeling that requires extensive human effort. Our feature extraction model will be the ﬁrst
comprehensive classiﬁcation and segmentation method for ART. To aid in embryo selection, we will develop
novel deep learning-based models to predict probabilities of achieving pregnancy by accepting visual features and
EHR data as the input. We will also develop visual analytic tools that allow analysts to better understand and steer
these deep learning models. We will estimate the importance of each input interpretable factor in embryo selection
to explain the prediction to embryologists. Finally, we will develop EmbryoProﬁler, a clinical decision support
system for ART, that combines our machine learning-based models with a user-facing suite of visual analytic
tools to support user guidance and clinical decision making. EmbryoProﬁler will help facilitate daily operation in
clinics, foster human-guided decision making, enrich data-driven embryo analysis, and enhance the ability to
select the developmentally most competent embryo for transfer to improve ART success rates. Our project will
create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians."

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are engineered nanoparticles with numerous
applications and they are commonly ‘functionalized’ by the addition of chemical groups (e.g.,
carboxyl or amine groups) to modify their unique physicochemical properties. Increasing
evidence in rodent models indicate that MWCNTs are an emerging risk for lung diseases. In
particular, MWCNTs exacerbate allergen-induced airway disease in rodents, suggesting a
potential hazard for humans with allergic asthma. The long-term pathology of asthma features
airway fibrosis and mucous cell metaplasia, defined herein as allergic airway disease. Importantly,
current asthma therapies treat inflammation and bronchospasm, but do not reduce allergic airway
disease. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism(s) through which nanoparticles exacerbate
allergic airway disease would fill critical knowledge and treatment gaps. We propose a mechanism
of nanoparticle exacerbation of chronic airway disease mediated by the adsorption of proteolytic
house dust mite (HDM) allergens to the surface of MWCNTs to form an ‘allergen corona’.
Allergens in the corona have increased proteolytic activity and activate the protease-activated
receptor-2 (PAR2) on lung macrophages. Triggering of PARs has been implicated in M2-like ‘pro-
fibrotic’ polarization of macrophages, a process that is regulated by STAT transcription factors.
Our preliminary data show that PAR2 deficiency in cells or mice increases STAT1 signaling but
decreases STAT3 signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that MWCNTs exacerbate allergic airway
disease by enhancing the proteolytic activity of allergens to increase PAR2 activation in
macrophages leading to induction of STAT3 signaling and suppression of STAT1 signaling. In
Aim 1 we will characterize the allergen corona on MWCNTs exposed to HDM extract, determine
that functionalization alters corona formation, and show that corona allergens have enhanced
proteolytic activity. In Aim 2 we will determine whether MWCNTs with HDM allergen corona
activate PAR2 in macrophages in vitro to induce STAT3 signaling or suppress STAT1 signaling
to enhance pro-fibrotic cytokine expression. In Aim 3 we will determine whether MWCNTs with
HDM allergen corona exacerbate allergic airway disease in mice and whether this is dependent
on PAR2 induction of STAT3 activation or suppression of STAT1 activation. Completion of these
studies will define a novel mechanism and fundamental basis through which nanoparticles
exacerbate allergic airway disease. This work will have significant and broad implications for a
variety of engineered nanoparticles and their impact on human health."
10844594,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid. Indeed, this is the case in TSC.
Despite the importance of this problem, the molecular connection among these disorders are poorly
understood. Importantly, pharmacological therapies that can mitigate these comorbid symptoms are lacking.
Because of these medical needs, we are taking advantage of TSC as a model system to gain a better
understanding of the mechanisms linking epilepsy, autism and anxiety disorders. The mammalian/mechanistic
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is hyperactive in epilepsy, autism, anxiety disorders, and TSC. A kinase that
regulates protein synthesis, our previous work has demonstrated that perturbations in mTOR greatly affects
the levels of proteins at synapses—critical subcellular structures that mediate communication among neurons.
Of note, these comorbid disorders manifest synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, we have discovered that mTOR
equally induces and inhibits synaptic protein levels. Thus, chronic, overactive mTOR may perpetually keep
synapses in a state of disease causing some proteins to be overexpressed and others to be underexpressed.
Unlike the proteins that are overexpressed when mTOR is hyperactive, the identity of the underexpressed
proteins and how their levels are regulated are relatively unknown. Insights into the mechanisms underlying the
diminished expression of proteins when mTOR is hyperactive is essential to gain a better understanding of
how these comorbid disorders are molecularly linked. We have recently found that mTOR controls the levels of
synaptic DJ-1, a newly-identified RNA binding protein that represses the translation of its associated mRNAs.
Thus, DJ-1 may mediate the underexpression of proteins at or near the synapse when mTOR is active. Two of
these underexpressed proteins whose mRNAs associated with DJ-1 are CaV1.2 and alpha2delta2—L-type
voltage-dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC) subunits implicated in epilepsy, autism and anxiety disorders.
Using molecular and behavioral approaches, we will determine the mechanisms and impact of aberrant DJ-
1/L-VDCC pathway in mediating anxiety-like disorders and epilepsy in two mouse models of TSC. These
studies will lay down a biological framework to delineate underlying mechanisms that may be shared among
comorbid neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, paving a way for potential treatments for epilepsy,
autism, anxiety disorders and TSC. Our investigations on DJ-1 and its downstream targets may also offer a
pathway that can be exploited to expand our tools and avenues in treating complex, neurological disorders.
Lastly, these studies will develop and sustain research excellence of a new investigator at NC A&T State
University, a Historically Black College and University, catalyze institutional research culture, and enrich the
university’s research environment. Importantly, our proposed investigations will provide underserved graduate
and undergraduate students in biomedical sciences with robust research opportunities, contributing to the
development of a diverse scientific workforce."
10818365,"This T34 U-RISE application represents a transition from two previous 5-year cycles as an R25 mechanism at
the University of Puerto Rico Ponce (UPRP). Our students are underrepresented Hispanics including individuals
from disadvantage economic backgrounds, with disabilities, and first generations attending to college with
interest in Biomedical Sciences. Hurricanes, earthquakes, and a global pandemic affected our students from
altering their routines, environment, change to use teaching-learning virtual tools, and to be emotionally
distressed. Knowing our student population and their recent stressors, we will implement evidence-based
strategies that were successful previously, now considering these obstacles. The proposal objectives are: (1)
Increase the graduation rate and decrease the time to graduation of U-RISE trainees at the UPRP. By using an
innovative holistic program including wellness, safety, and ethical environment, understanding of cultural diversity,
and development of technical, operational, and professional skills we will allow a successful transition to join
research-oriented and non-traditional careers in biomedical sciences contributing to a diverse and inclusive
future biomedical workforce. a) We expect to increase the graduation rate of U-RISE UPR trainees to 90%
compared to the current Department of Biology (47%) and the Institutional (45%); b) decrease graduation time
from 6 to 5 years. (2) Engage U-RISE trainees at UPRP in research-oriented activities through mentored
experiences encouraging academic excellence, training technical and professional skills, and fostering
teamwork, following, and promoting the responsible conduct of research, and reassuring a safe and ethical
environment. We expect that 85% of U-RISE UPRP trainees will complete the proposed activities as evidenced
by the appropriate assessment tools. (3) Increase the number of UPRP students, as participants of the U-RISE
Program, trained in a holistic system representing the next generation of qualified U-RISE trainees with increased
skills and competitiveness to apply, enroll and successfully complete a Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program
(Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.) at Research Intensive Institutions. We expect that 70% of U-RISE UPRP trainees will be
accepted into a Ph.D. Program within three years after graduation. We include new recruitment approaches,
promote more interaction between former, current U-RISE and freshmen students interested in applying to U-
RISE. We also develop a Certification Principles and Applications of Biomedical Research Tools: From Scientific
Curiosity to Hands-on Approaches (PABRT). PABRT includes technical, operational, professional, and research-
related activities for the Biology Students at UPRP as an alternative to obtain research experience and potentially
awaken the students’ interest in research an decide to join U-RISE or entering the Biomedical Sciences
workforce. We also developed mentoring system including scientists at different academic and research levels.
We will promote U-RISE trainees’ future scientists to live by fostering an inclusive and diverse community, at the
same time they continue enhancing their science identity and self-efficacy."
10896922,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Several master regulator (MR) genes have been characterized in tissue stem cells across organs and
species. However, they remain poor candidates for therapeutic manipulation because they are highly
pleiotropic, affecting hundreds of targets and operating across many organ systems. Therefore, only a
better understanding of how less pleiotropic downstream MR targets coordinate stem cell proliferation,
self-renewal and differentiation will unlock the full potential of stem cells in regenerative medicine. The
long-term goal of this project is to map the regulatory landscape established by MR genes and their
targets in intestinal stem cells (ISCs), using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system.
Drosophila ISCs divide asymmetrically, giving rise to a new ISC and a sister that will become an
absorptive enterocyte (EC) or a hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cell (EE). The specific hypothesis
driving this proposal is that cross-regulatory interactions between MR target pathways can lead to non-
linear, unpredictable outcomes on ISC behavior when they are manipulated simultaneously. To test this
hypothesis, CAP, Klaroid and Indy, three experimentally validated targets of the ISC MR genes Escargot
and STAT, will be manipulated alone or in combination within ISCs using an inducible Gal4/UAS system.
The effect of their individual vs. combined manipulations on intestinal homeostasis will be assessed via
three separate but complementary approaches. In Aim 1, immunofluorescence microscopy will be used
to compare ISC number, morphology, mitotic rate, and differentiation potential, based on well-established
cell type markers (esg-GFP for ISCs, Su(H) activation for EBs, Pdm1 and Pros staining for ECs and EEs,
respectively). Automated image analysis through ImageJ and CellProfiler will be used to analyze multiple
images per group, allowing a robust statistical analysis of the data. In Aim 2, fluorescent activity reporters
will be used to compare the effect of single vs. dual MR target manipulations on key ISC signal
transduction pathways (EGFR, Notch, Wnt, STAT and JNK). In Aim 3, lifespan and intestinal barrier
integrity (Smurf) assays will be used to compare the effect that individual vs. combined MR target
manipulations have on the regenerative capacity of intestinal tissue following chemical injury or
pathogenic infection. These research aims may generate evidence that challenges the widely held
premise that combination therapies can only improve outcome due to additive complementation of
positive effects. If so, this project will have a significant impact on our conceptual approach to stem cell
manipulation for regenerative medicine. In addition, this project was specifically designed to engage a
large number of students from underrepresented backgrounds in biomedical research, satisfying another
important mission of the NIH: to diversify the scientific workforce, and thus foster innovation, improve
research quality and enhance the public trust and investment in science."
10837053,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 To achieve optimal care for the half of U.S. adults with diabetes who are treated with insulin or insulin
secretagogues, it is crucial to prevent hypoglycemia, which causes substantial morbidity and hospital utilization.
However, limited evidence – including our own preliminary analyses – suggests that clinicians do not routinely
assess for hypoglycemia and rarely take preventive actions such as modifying diabetes therapy or providing
anticipatory guidance for hypoglycemia prevention. The Endocrine Society has called for interventions to improve
hypoglycemia prevention in clinical encounters, yet no evidence-based interventions exist.
 In this proposal, we will fill major gaps in understanding hypoglycemia prevention and patient-provider
communication in primary care encounters, and develop a scalable intervention to prevent hypoglycemia that
can be integrated into the primary care workflow. Patient-provider communication is especially important for
hypoglycemia prevention because it requires clinicians to gather detailed history, convey complex information,
and motivate patients to make behavior change. The proposed intervention will build upon effective interventions
that improve chronic disease care by using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) to routinely assess
patient symptoms and prompt clinicians to take action addressing them. The specific research aims are: Aim 1)
Determine the frequency of hypoglycemia assessment and prevention practices in a national sample of Veterans
Affairs primary care visits, and develop a framework for hypoglycemia communication quality. Aim 2) Develop
an intervention that integrates PROMs for hypoglycemia assessment into the primary care workflow, linked to a
provider toolkit to enhance hypoglycemia communication and prevention practices. Aim 3) To conduct a pilot
study to evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the hypoglycemia prevention intervention developed
in Aim 2. These aims lay the groundwork for an R01 application to conduct a definitive clinical trial of the
intervention developed here, and address the urgent need for scalable interventions that translate evidence-
based practices for hypoglycemia prevention into the primary care setting.
 Dr. Scott Pilla’s long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator developing and
leading interventional research that improves the health of patients with diabetes and their management in
primary care. He seeks a K23 mentored career development award to obtain critical skills and experience to
lead an independently-funded research program. His career development plan includes didactics and mentored
research experience in qualitative and communication research methods, patient reported outcomes research,
and the conduct and leadership of clinical trials. This training will occur in the rich environment at Johns Hopkins,
including the Division of General Internal Medicine and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Pilla will
receive guidance from an experienced team of mentors and advisors with expertise in patient-provider
communication, qualitative research, and clinical trials, who have a track record of mentoring and funding."
10847390,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of mortality among neonates globally, particularly among low
birthweight infants from pregnancies complicated by prematurity or placental insufficiency. Maternal immuniza-
tion, the vaccination of pregnant women to enhance antibody transported across the placenta to the fetus, is
utilized increasingly as an infection prevention strategy to protect neonates from pathogens such as influenza,
and may be critical as new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are developed. This proposal aims to better eluci-
date transplacental antibody transfer in low- and high-risk pregnancies, specifically those with prematurity or
placental insufficiency, which is not known. It also describes a research training program that will allow me to
become an independent physician-scientist with a translational research program focusing on infectious
diseases and vaccines in pregnancy. This proposal builds upon my training in high-risk obstetrics and global
health, and provides a detailed plan to improve my knowledge of virology, immunology, vaccinology, cohort
studies and statistical analysis. It incorporates the expertise of an outstanding mentorship team, including
experts in infectious diseases, immunology, pathology, statistics, and computational biology who are dedicated
to the success of this project and the development of my career as an independent clinical researcher.
The first aim of this proposal involves establishing normal and high-risk pregnancy cohorts and quantifying
transplacental antibody transfer in the context of pregnancies resulting in both normal and low birth weight
infants, including those complicated by placental insufficiency leading to small for gestational age infants or
prematurity. I will compare quantity of transplacental antibody transfer of total IgG, influenza- and SARS-CoV-
2- specific antibodies, and expression of neonatal Fc receptor in placentas. I will also compare neonatal
immunity against influenza among women who did and did not receive influenza vaccine during pregnancy,
allowing the opportunity to develop multivariable models and adjust for multiple clinical covariates. For my
second aim, I will characterize antibody profiles and transplacental transfer in the same cohorts using a
systems serology approach to determine biophysical and effector functions of maternal and fetal immunology.
Through accomplishing the aims in this proposal, I will contribute significantly to our knowledge of maternal
immunizations, maternal and neonatal immune interactions and neonatal immunity against influenza and
SARS-CoV-2. Improved understanding and characterization of transplacental antibody transfer in the context
of maternal immunizations may provide insight in the optimization and individualization of vaccine delivery and
timing in high-risk pregnancies and, ultimately, has the potential to improve neonatal survival globally. This
proposal will allow me to develop a unique set of cross-disciplinary skills and expertise in order to transition to
independence as a physician scientist with a larger research program specializing in respiratory infectious
diseases and vaccines within the context of low- and high-risk pregnancies."
10850590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Latinos account for the largest share of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases (60%) and deaths (48%) compared to
any other racial/ethnic group in California. Additionally, Latino households have experienced a dramatic
increase in household food insecurity due to the pandemic. This is especially distressing for Latinos with type 2
diabetes (T2DM) as household food insecurity is associated with worse glycemic control, which has life-
threatening consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic. T2DM, and especially poorly controlled T2DM, is a
risk factor for death from COVID-19. Effective multilevel interventions to improve household food insecurity and
glycemic control are urgently needed for Latinos with diabetes to mitigate disparities due to COVID-19. The
goal of ADELANTE (Addressing Diabetes by ELevating Access to Nutrition: A Trial of Effectiveness) is
to determine whether a multi-level intervention to improve household food insecurity and glycemic
control is effective for Latino patients with diabetes. We will use a type 1 hybrid trial to assess the
effectiveness of the multilevel intervention on the primary outcome of glycemic control (HbA1c) at 6 months.
Participants (n=355) will be randomized to either: 1) 12 weeks of household deliveries of fiber-rich foods
(vegetables, beans/legumes, and whole grains) plus a 12-month remotely delivered, culturally-adapted lifestyle
behavioral intervention called Vida Sana, or 2) a waitlist control arm, receiving the intervention after a 6-month
delay. We will follow participants for 12 months to assess the primary outcome ofHbA1c at 6 months as well as
key secondary outcomes such as HbA1c at 12 months, and diabetes- and COVID-related stress at 6 and 12
months. Additionally, we will recruit up to 2 household members for each participant to assess household-level
secondary outcomes such as household food insecurity, dietary behaviors, and COVID-related stress. To
assess the future potential of implementation and dissemination of the multilevel intervention in primary care
we will use mixed methods including quantitative measures (e.g., intervention dose and fidelity) and qualitative
interviews with participants and key stakeholders (e.g., providers, clinic leadership, community supported
agricultural group) according to the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
Maintenance) framework. We will involve patients and our longstanding community partners in all phases of
the trial. The trial will take place in Alameda County, California, which is home to a large and diverse Latino
population, at La Clínica de La Raza, a community safety net clinic with multiple locations throughout Alameda
County. Successful completion of these aims will provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of improving
household food insecurity and glycemic control among Latinos with diabetes during the pandemic."
10830944,"While short-term outcomes following organ transplant have greatly improved with the development of more
effective immunosuppression, long-term outcomes remain problematic with a significant number of patients
developing diabetes, accelerated heart disease as well as increased rates of cancers and infections. For
decades transplant researchers and clinicians have sought to develop strategies to induce immune tolerance
to transplanted organs and avoid the requirement for life-long immunosuppression. It is likely that any
successful tolerance regimen will incorporate targeted immunosuppression strategies like costimulation
blockade. One of the most important interactions is the CD40-CD154 pathway. We will evaluate novel,
clinically relevant therapeutics targeting either CD40 or CD154 and explore their role in facilitating tolerance.
Based on our recent publication showing that CD11b is a novel alternate receptor for CD154 during
alloimmunity, we will also test novel nanotechnology to block the CD154:CD11b interaction, an important
mechanism of cross-talk between the innate and adaptive immune responses during transplantation.
Moreover, based on our published data showing that memory T cells are a potent barrier to transplantation
tolerance, we will determine the role of OX40-OX40L blockade to control alloreactive memory CD8+ T cells and
promote a pro-regulatory environment. In addition, we will assess the importance of the VISTA pathway on the
induction of donor-specific tolerance using an agonistic anti-human VISTA antibody. VISTA has a dual role in
negatively regulating antigen-specific T cell responses while also impacting the innate immune response by
inhibiting ischemia reperfusion injury, monocyte activation and neutrophil migration thereby suppressing the
early inflammatory response. We will also investigate the contribution of IL-1 and the inflammasome on
tolerance induction and employ clinically applicable therapeutics to control early inflammation during the
induction of tolerance. The combination of cellular therapy and costimulation blockade is a powerful strategy to
promote donor-specific tolerance. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have inherent
immunosuppressive properties and have been used to facilitate tolerance. They modulate innate immunity and
inhibit T cell activation and effector cell function while also promoting regulatory T cell expansion for
maintenance of long-term donor specific tolerance. Apoptotic donor leukocytes (ADLs) represent another
promising cellular therapy that has been proven to control alloreactive T cells and promote donor specific T cell
deletion. We will use donor bone marrow derived MDSCs or ADLs in combination with the above novel
therapeutics to promote tolerance in nonhuman primate kidney transplantation."

The Immunosurveillance and Immunopathology Core (IIC) by performing mechanistic studies on samples from
the 3 projects of this application will serve a synergistic scientific role with strong emphasis on transplant
tolerance, the central focus of this Program. The IIC will perform assays to analyze the immune alterations in
peripheral circulation, graft and spleen induced by the tolerance regimens proposed in Projects 1, 2 and 3. The
Transplantation Tolerance Laboratory (TTL) has developed a series of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
to analyze the donor-specific immune responses in NHP transplant recipients that will be shared across all the
projects to harmonize the analyses proposed across all the projects in the U19 program. The Core has optimized,
validated, and adopted several cutting-edge technologies and pipelines for bioinformatic data analysis of this
complex dataset across multiple tissue compartments. Comprehensive immune analyses of samples from the 3
projects by the IIC will aid in avoidance of assay and analysis variations resulting in harmonization of results that
will aid in insights obtained in one model to be synergistically deployed across other projects. IIC will perform
assays outlined in the four Specific Aims presented below and conduct bioinformatics and data analysis pipeline
to assess the immune alterations induced by the distinct tolerance regimens utilized in the Projects 1, 2 and 3.
Aim 1: Define the alterations in the immune landscape of renal transplant recipients by high-dimensional CyTOF
profiling of circulating immune cells during induction and maintenance of tolerance. Aim 2: Generate and validate
TCR signatures using single cell TCRseq to track donor-antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Aim 3: Define
the fate and function of donor-antigen specific CD4+ T cells with MHC class II tetramers and single cell ATAC
and RNA sequencing in serial peripheral blood mononuclear cells of tolerant and rejecting renal allograft
recipients. Aim 4: Analyze the spatio-temporal organization of immune cells in renal allografts, spleen, and lymph
nodes at the transcription level by Digital Spatial Profiling and at the protein level by MIBI-TOF. Analysis of
multiple tissue compartments longitudinally to generate a large, but highly controlled, dataset. We intentionally
apply this multi-omics approach to advantage parallel, rather than sequential, discrimination of system level
analyses of immune mechanisms that contribute to transplant tolerance. Analysis of samples from the 3 projects
utilizing distinct tolerance regimens will provide new immunological insights on induction and maintenance of
tolerance. Moreover, the performance of assays across projects supports lateral transfer of knowledge to identify
commonality, independent of strategy, revealing principal features underlying immune tolerance to advance
towards successful clinical application. IIC will interact regularly with the PIs of the 3 Projects and with the
administrative core to design, execute, analyze and trouble shoot the studies proposed in this application."
10847373,"ABSTRACT
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1) can establish both lytic and latent infections in a cell type-specific fashion with
known and emerging neuropathological ramifications, respectively. Provocative data now link reactivation of
latent HSV1 infection to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the etiological basis of which remains incompletely defined.
Here we propose to employ powerful new genomic technologies to identify and characterize the actual cell types
that harbor latent and reactivated HSV1, extending recent findings that have revealed an increased abundance
of herpes virus transcripts in affected regions of human AD brains. Using a modified single-nucleus sequencing
approach, which allows for DNA accessibility and global transcription to be assessed in the same nucleus, we
will interrogate human control and AD brain samples as well a HSV1-infected brain organoids and mouse models
of acute and progressive HSV1-induced neurotoxicity. These studies promise to reveal cell type-specific
enhancer landscapes and transcriptional profiles consequent to lytic, latent, or reactivated HSV1 in the brain
while also providing insights into the cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous effects of its presence. In
addition, we propose to elucidate a novel innate immune pathway by which HSV1 lytic transcripts trigger the
sentinel kinase PKR to initiate a cascade of nuclear events that include the secondary activation of the
transcriptional regulator PARP1 and culminate in a NF-kB-dependent inflammatory gene expression program,
potentially providing a molecular mechanism by which occasional HSV1 reactivation in the brain could contribute
to an inflammatory milieu that promotes the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, this molecular pathway may
underlie diverse microbial and possibly non-microbial inflammatory triggers in the brain that have been implicated
in AD. We also hypothesize that HSV1 latency-associated transcripts (LATs) have distinct and opposing
genomic functions as well as non-genomic actions in host neurons and possibly non-neuronal brain cells, the
balance of which preserves neuronal cell integrity but may facilitate low-grade, chronic inflammation in the
context of latent infection irrespective of viral reactivation. Based on enticing preliminary evidence, we propose
to investigate the idea that the sense (S) and antisense (AS) LATs impact transcription in a partially dichotomous
fashion by associating with specific regulatory elements in the HSV1 and host genomes in collaboration with the
KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) co-regulator KAP1. We hypothesize that these genomic events influence the
AD process by affecting neuronal function through modulation of KZFP-mediated regulation of human
endogenous retrovirus (HERV) repeats. We further hypothesize that the LATs have a complementary non-
genomic role that mitigates the innate immune response and suppresses cell death programs, at least in part,
by inhibition of PKR. Finally, we propose to exploit these protective properties of the HSV1 LATs as a unique
prophylactic strategy for AD."

Research: Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening health condition that affects an increasing proportion of
individuals in the US alone. Current daily management of patients with food allergies is limited by the
unavailability of reliable biomarkers to accurately predict onset, severity and resolution of disease, and by the
lack of curative treatments to replace strict avoidance of the culprit food. A deeper understanding of additional
mechanisms - other than IgE - acting in food allergy pathogenesis will be key in filling these gaps. This proposal
details a five-year plan to provide Dr. Crestani with the training and expertise to evaluate the role of RELMb as
a novel biomarker and molecular player in food allergy building and expanding on strong preliminary
observations both in a murine model of food allergy and in food allergic children. The comprehensive evaluation
of the role of RELMb in food allergy holds the promise of identifying strongly needed biomarker(s) of disease
and possible targets for therapeutic interventions which will be the focus of future longitudinal investigations and
may significantly impact the daily care and quality of life of food allergic patients.
Candidate: Dr. Crestani long-term goal is to become an independent, NIH-funded investigator focused on
disease mechanisms and biomarkers of food allergy, with the goal of improving the currently suboptimal care of
food-allergic individuals. There is an urgent and unmet need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches
in food allergies. To achieve this goal, her short-term objectives are to obtain further training in biostatistics, data
analysis, laboratory techniques, as well as practical skills in cohort building and management. This will be
accomplished with formal classes, collaborative work, attendance at conferences, and guidance from established
mentors/scientific advisors with relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and
scientific knowledge that will successfully position her for an R01 application and an independent career as a
physician-scientist in the field of food allergy.
Environment: Dr. Crestani will be mentored by Dr. Chatila (Primary Mentor), a leader investigator in
mechanisms of food allergy and head of a fully NIH-funded laboratory, and Dr. Phipatanakul (Co-Mentor), an
expert in epidemiology, human cohorts, and clinical investigation in asthma and allergic diseases. Dr. Crestani
has assembled an extraordinary team of advisors, including Drs. Lynda Schneider, Kari Nadeau and Rima
Kaddurah-Daouk, who have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Crestani’s career
development and successful completion of the proposed project. During this award period, Dr. Crestani will
obtain a Master of Public Health in Clinical Effectiveness through the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH),
and complete additional complementary coursework. The academic environment created by the mentors,
institution, and Harvard community at large will provide the ideal milieu for learning and research implementation
that will guarantee Dr. Crestani transition into a highly successful independent investigator."
10828794,"Abstract:
Despite the recent advances in immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade, radical new approaches are
needed to both improve the efficacy of existing treatments, and to offer entirely new therapeutic modalities. In
the previous term of this award we developed an immunotherapeutic agent that exploited the myeloid branch of
the immune system by blocking the SIRPa/CD47 axis, potentiating macrophage attack on tumors. We
engineered a unique, high-affinity SIRPa antagonist of CD47 that greatly potentiated the anti-tumor efficacy of
several clinically approved anti-tumor antibodies, yet offered the advantage of being tumor selective and non-
toxic, which is a limitation of most current anti-CD47 mAbs. This molecule is now in clinical trials for several
cancer types, thus completing the cycle of bench to bedside in one term of the award. In this renewal application,
we request support to develop a new paradigm for receptor inhibition in oncology. We present a new approach
to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and antagonizing the CD47/SIRPa axis, by exploiting an untapped
natural biological mechanism for dampening immune receptor signaling. We have found that
ITIM/ITAM/ITSM/ITTM-containing immunoreceptors, such as the checkpoint receptors PD1 and CTLA4, tonically
signal in the absence of ligand engagement. As a result, blocking PD-L1 binding with anti-PD1 antibodies, does
not fully “take the brakes off” of T cell activation: ligand-independent PD1 tonic signaling significantly blunts
T cell activation. We have devised a strategy reduce or eliminate tonic signaling, termed Receptor Inhibition by
Phosphatase Recruitment (RIPR), that relies on the cis-ligation of kinases-mediated signaling receptors to a cell
surface phosphatase, such as CD45, to achieve complete signal inhibition through intracellular
dephosphorylation of the target receptor intracellular ITAM/ITIM/ITSM/ITTM domains. RIPR molecules are bi-
specific antibodies that compel dimerization of a target receptor to a cell-surface phosphatase, inhibiting both
ligand binding and tonic signaling. Using the PD1 system as our first target, we find that we achieve significantly
greater inhibition of checkpoint blockade using a RIPR that dimerizes PD1 with the T cell phosphatase CD45,
versus ligand blocking by anti-PD1 antibodies. Furthermore, we see enhanced therapeutic efficacy over anti-
PD1 in several mouse tumor models. In this proposal we seek support to better understand the mechanism of
RIPR at the biochemical and cellular level, to assess its therapeutic efficacy in a range of mouse tumor models
both alone and in combination with therapeutic antibodies, and to explore RIPR applications beyond checkpoint
inhibition to other receptors, such as CTLA4 and SIRPa, that are oncology drug targets."
11062969,"Project Summary/Abstract
Summary: Precision cancer medicine’s foundation lies in discovering and exploiting pathways that are essential
for cancer cells, but dispensable for cancer cells. While such pathways exist, they are relatively uncommon.
Much more often the oncogenic pathways activated in cancer cells are essential for many healthy cells as well,
at least in some adult tissue. This unfortunate fact is referred to as a low Therapeutic Index (TI), and frustrates
many promising cancer treatments. This project seeks to improve the TI of inhibitors of critical effectors of the
RAS MEK ERK pathway in the deadliest human cancers using Fe(II) activation of drugs and developing new,
Fe(II) activatable therapies.
Background: As cancer cells transform from normal to malignant, they incur metabolic and potentially
pharmacologic liabilities. Their handling of iron in its most dangerous form, the Fe(II) state, is particularly
dysregulated, leading to an increased labile iron pool (LIP). We invented a new way to preferentially target tumor
cells based on increased avidity for, and elevated concentrations of labile Fe2+ with an Iron-Activated Drug
Conjugate (FeADC) ap
pro
ach inspired by a clinically validated 1,2,4-trioxolane (TRX) moiety with Fe2+-
dependent pharmacology. The cancer cell then activates the FeADC and is exposed to the payload. We are
focusing on MEK inhibitors because 1) their therapeutic index is low, 2) they hold promise in KRAS-driven solid
tumors and 3) the KRAS oncogene drives increases in the LIP to a level we think exploitable.
Methods: First we will validate the efficacy of our modified MEK inhibitor and a modified chemotherapeutic in an
autochthonous, immunocompetent model of mouse lung cancer driven by KrasG12D. We will then use cutting edge
functional screening to identify the cellular enzymes needed to activate (uncage) the FeADC into active payloads
in the cancer cell. We will then further develop the Fe(II)-Promoted Activation of 1,2,4-Trioxolanes to induce a
specialized form of cellular death known as ferroptosis in cancer cells.
Impact: This project focuses on a improving the therapeutic index of targeted inhibitors, especially in the most
underserved tumors; those with KRAS mutations. We have the potential to immediately impact a large swath of
anticancer therapeutics via our flexible and powerful prodrug approach. Through better understanding of the
mechanisms of cellular Fe(II)-Promoted Activation of 1,2,4-Trioxolanes, we may also develop new classes of
anticancer compounds called FeADCs and leveraging ferroptosis as a therapeutic endpoint in our developmental
studies."
10861719,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint receptors (e.g. CTLA-4, PD-1, Tim-3) are expressed on dysfunctional or “exhausted” CD8+
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that exhibit defective effector functions (cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory
cytokine production) and are thus poor mediators of tumor clearance. In the last decade, immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) has achieved durable responses in many cancers, including melanoma, lung, and renal cancer.
Despite this success, current estimates indicate that only 12% of all cancer patients respond to ICB. These
observations underscore the remaining unmet clinical need in cancer treatment and the need to understand what
constitutes effective response to ICB in order to improve response rates.
Through examination of the population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ TILs upon ICB, we have identified
stem-like CD8+ TILs that are integral for the response to ICB. These cells are tumor antigen-specific, exhibit
polyfunctional effector capacity, and increase in proportion upon various ICBs across different cancer types.
Although the transcription factor TCF-1 plays an important role in the maintenance and effector function of these
cells, we have found that TCF-1 expression in CD8+ T cells is not requisite for positive response to ICB in all
tumor contexts. These observations underscore the relevance of stem-like CD8+ TILs for effective response to
ICB and the need to better understand how TCF-1 and additional factors regulate their biology.
Stem cells reside in niches where crosstalk between stem cells and other cells in the niche regulates not only
their maintenance and function but also the function of niche cells. We have found that tumor-associated dendritic
cells (DCs) are altered when TCF-1 is absent in mature CD8+ T cells. We thus hypothesize that 1) stem-like
CD8+ TILs reside within niches in the tumor micro-environment (TME) where they interact with and modulate
antigen-presenting cells; 2) this intercellular communication circuit within the niche may be required for effective
priming of anti-tumor T cell responses; and 3) modulation of stem-like CD8+ TILs may positively or negatively
influence this communication circuit, thus affecting the efficacy of ICB.
Our overarching goal is to understand the cell-autonomous regulation of stem-like CD8+ TILs, their
crosstalk with other cells in the TME, and how together they govern the activation of proficient anti-
tumor CD8+ T cell responses and ICB efficacy. Accordingly, we propose the following aims: 1) Determine the
role of TCF-1 in the generation of proficient anti-tumor T cell responses; 2) Test the role of novel candidate
regulators of stem- and effector-like CD8+ TILs, and 3) Characterize the crosstalk between stem-like CD8+ TILs
and the TME."

 Older adults often experience physical decline that can be directly ameliorated by physical
activity and exercise. Evidence is building that exercise prevents cognitive decline or delays the onset of
debilitating dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's disease [AD]) yet, the optimal dose and combination of exercise
modalities for promoting brain health, however, remains unknown and essentially untested.
 Our long-term research goal is to develop and test strategies to support successful aging and
prevent AD. We have successful ongoing (R01AG053312, R01AG053952, R01AG049749, R01AG52954,
R01AG043962) and completed projects (R01AG033673, R01AG034614, KL2TR000119) around a theme of
community-based exercise programs for older adults. We will enroll 280 individuals, age 65 to 80 years
without cognitive impairment, into a 52-week exercise intervention to test the combined and independent
effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognition, brain structure, and physical function. We will also
explore underlying biological mechanisms that may link exercise with brain health.
 Participants will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups: flexibility, toning and balance (control), aerobic
exercise training, progressive resistance training, or combined aerobic and resistance training. All intervention
groups represent the most common modalities of exercise and directly reflect the public health
recommendations for aerobic and resistance training. Exercise training will occur in a community setting
through the network of Greater Kansas City YMCAs. We hypothesize that 52 weeks of exercise will improve
1) cognitive performance, 2) regional brain volume, 3) cardiorespiratory fitness and strength 4) biomarkers.
 This will be the largest study to assess the combined and independent effects of the two most
recommended forms of exercise. Demonstrating specific exercise effects on cognitive function and brain
health in older adults would have enormous public health implications. The study's results will also impact
public health policy and education by providing evidence towards the specific or synergistic effects of aerobic
and resistance training on cognition and brain structure. Encouraging the public to adapt more active lifestyles
and stimulate the development of effective exercise delivery programs to enhance initiation and maintenance
of physical activity interventions is key to increasing the number of quality years of life for America's aging
population."
10849630,"Abstract
Viral suppression is the final stage of the HIV treatment cascade, which serves as the framework for UNAIDS’
90-90-90 goals. Sustained viral suppression is one of four strategic areas of the “Ending the HIV Epidemic
(EtHE): A Plan for America” federal campaign, launched in February 2019, which aims for the reduction of new
HIV infections in the United States (US) by 75% and 90% by 2025 and 2030, respectively. The EtHE campaign
focuses on 48 US counties and 7 states, including South Carolina (SC). Given the importance of viral
suppression in ending the US HIV epidemic, an optimal predictive model of viral status can help clinicians
identify those at risk of poor viral control and inform clinical improvements in HIV treatment and care. Various
indicators to characterize the longitudinal virologic outcomes have been proposed in the literature such as
sustained viral suppression, viral rebound, low-level viraemia (LLV), persistent LLV, and virologic blips.
However, some critical gaps still exist in our efforts to develop an optimal predictive model of viral suppression.
These gaps include the use of limited indicators of virologic outcomes, limited duration of follow-up, limited
data sources, lack of consideration of structural and socioenvironmental data, small or unrepresentative
samples of people living with HIV (PLWH), and limited efforts to translate research findings into service-ready
tools for clinical use. With NIH support (R01AI127203) since 2017, we have utilized a Big Data approach to
examine treatment gaps (e.g., missed opportunities for diagnosis and linkage to care) among a statewide
cohort of PLWH in SC. This ongoing research extracted longitudinal electronic health records data from six
state agencies and then linked the patient-level data with county-level data (e.g., socioeconomic indicators,
number of health care professionals, hospitals, and health care facilities) from multiple publicly available data
sources. The resultant integrated database has enabled us to successfully “track” 11,470 patients who were
diagnosed with HIV from 2005 to 2016 in SC and identify the gaps in HIV treatment linkage and retention.
Based on the experience and accomplishment of the R01AI127203, we submit this application to examine the
longitudinal dynamic pattern of viral suppression, develop optimal predictive models of various viral
suppression indicators, and translate the models to service-ready tools for clinical use. In the proposed
research, we will: 1) continue to “follow” our cohort for another five years (and also expand the cohort by
adding PLWH diagnosed between 2016-2020); 2) expand our database to include additional data on critical
predictors of viral suppression (e.g., treatment and laboratory data, alcohol and substance use data) from two
newly participating statewide data sources; 3) employ artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling to understand
the dynamic viral load patterns and their predictors; and 4) develop and pilot-test a multifactorial decision
system for clinical use. The results will enable the identification of PLWH with poor viral control and suggest
“when” and “how” to help those PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression. The proposed research will
improve our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of viral suppression and inform tailored HIV care
management among PLWH in SC and beyond."
10875602,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cancer immunotherapy is based on the premise of immune-recognition and targeted
killing of tumor cells, thus possesses the promising power to eradicate aggressive disease. Notably to date,
immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly prolongs the survival of patients. Unfortunately,
recurrent and metastatic disease occurs to a significant portion of patients within 5 years largely due to
resistance to the immune checkpoint inhibitor. This largely stems from the local immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME), which is enriched with immunosuppressive myeloid cells. To reprogram the TME into
a “hot” environment enriched with functional myeloid cells, we designed a dual action immunostimulatory
nanoparticle (dual-NP) that triggers a highly potent activation of the dysfunctional tumor-resident myeloid cells.
The premise of our strategy is based on three key components: (1) Our previous studies showed that V domain
Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) is a novel myeloid cell-intrinsic immune checkpoint
protein, which controls antitumor immunity. We showed VISTA is highly expressed on immunosuppressive
myeloid cells and blocking VISTA can synergize with TLR9 agonist to reprogram the immunosuppressive
myeloid cells to boost antitumor immunity. (2) The dual-NP is co-loaded with a VISTA siRNA and the TLR9
agonist CpG. Upon intratumoral administration, the dual-NP ensures the simultaneous uptake of its synergistic
cargoes by the same tumor-resident myeloid cells and proficient intracellular delivery of each cargo, thus
achieving optimal effects to activate these cells. Our recent studies show that simultaneous silencing of the
VISTA gene and stimulation of TLR9 leads to a synergistic T cell-mediated tumor clearance and curative
responses with protective immunological memory against tumor recurrence. (3) We developed a simple and
controllable method to generate ionizable lipid dual-NPs of different sizes (i.e., 30, 40 or 60 nm) with high
degree of uniformity and consistency. Our studies show that small dual-NPs achieve widespread distribution
and predominant uptake by myeloid cells throughout the tumor volume upon intratumoral administration.
Innovation: To our knowledge, this is the first effort to combine advanced nanoparticle design, simultaneous
delivery of siRNA and a TLR agonist, and silencing of a gene related to an immune checkpoint protein specific
to myeloid cells.
AIM 1: Optimize the design of the dual-NP and test the ex vivo and in vivo efficacy in reprograming
tumorassociated myeloid cells.
AIM 2: Evaluate the short and long-term safety profile of the dual-NP and characterize the mechanism of
antitumor immune responses associated with dosage and frequency of dual-NP administration.
AIM 3: Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the dual-NP as a monotherapy and in combination with standard
immune checkpoint inhibitors in murine models of advanced melanoma and metastatic breast cancer."

This proposal aims to understand the effects of HIV on the humoral immune response to hepatitis B by
focusing on HBV-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), B cell repertoires, and monoclonal antibodies that
develop after acute hepatitis B infection or after treatment-induced control of infection. This proposal will study
185 persons (74 HIV+) in the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study who had acute hepatitis B while in follow-
up and whose outcome of either spontaneous control (n=163) or chronic infection (n=22) was previously
determined. We will also study an additional 21 participants with functional cure while on HBV treatment
(treatment-induced control). The first Aim focuses on plasma NAb responses during and 30 months after
spontaneous control of acute HBV infection in persons with and without HIV infection. We hypothesize that in
persons with HIV (PWH), the NAb responses will be weaker and less durable than in persons without HIV
infection. Decreased durability of NAb responses could contribute to the increased risk of HBV reactivation with
HIV infection. We will also assess plasma NAbs in participants with treatment-induced control of infection. We
hypothesize that these participants will demonstrate high NAb titers similar to those with spontaneous control
of acute infection. In the second Aim, we will isolate HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific B cells from
specimens obtained during acute infection or before and after treatment-induced control. We will compare the
molecular features of HBsAg-specific B cell receptors between those with spontaneous control of acute
infection, those who develop chronic hepatitis B, and those with treatment-induced control of infection. We will
also determine the effects of HIV on these molecular features. In the third Aim, we will clone monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) from these HBsAg-specific B cells and determine the mAbs’ functional characteristics. We
expect that the mAbs from persons with spontaneous control of acute infection will bind with higher affinity and
neutralize more potently than those who develop chronic infection, and that post-control mAbs from treatment-
induced controllers will be more potent than pre-control mAbs. We also expect that HIV will decrease the
affinity and potency of anti-HBs mAbs. Innovative aspects of this project include: 1) The unique cohort with a
large number of incident HBV infections with either spontaneous control or viral persistence in people living
with and without HIV infection, as well as rare individuals with treatment-induced control of HBV, 2) The ability
to detect NAb responses in plasma from human subjects, and 3) The ability to isolate HBsAg-specific B cells
for ex vivo study. To date, such studies have not been possible, explaining why there is little information on
NAb responses in HBV-infected humans. Results from this proposal will contribute to our understanding of the
effects of HIV on the immune response to hepatitis B and could facilitate development of a functional cure for
hepatitis B, the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide."

The mission of Wayne State University (WSU)—to create and advance knowledge, prepare a diverse student
body to thrive, and positively impact local and global communities—is in line with the goals and vision for the
proposed T34 program. Located in Detroit, Michigan, WSU is and has historically been a stabilizing institution
in the city and region. WSU is committed to driving this growth, and over the last five years has recruited over
50 new faculty members in the sciences alone. New faculty are drawn to WSU for various reasons, including
the diversity of the region, the exceptional facilities, and the success of our faculty, as evidenced in part by a
30% increase in federal funding since 2014. WSU is well-positioned to request continued support for its
transition from a successful R25 program to a T34 program, at the level of 20 undergraduate students per
year. The goal of the WSU program is to provide targeted training and mentoring that is individualized to meet
the needs of a diverse body of graduate students to facilitate successful completion of B.S. degrees and
transition to Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D. programs after graduation. Ultimately, these students will develop careers in
the biomedical sciences, and will go on to serve as mentors to future generations. Trainees will be selected at
the end of their freshman year for participation in a pre-MARC year during their sophomore year. At the end of
the pre-MARC year, students will be selected for participation in the MARC program that will last for two years
for each student. Participation in year-round research experiences, starting between the sophomore and junior
years, will be a part of the program. As with the R25 that is being replaced, the T34 program will focus on
developing and enhancing academic skills in addition to providing access to research experiences. Students in
the program will be part of our learning community, and remain active throughout their entire training at WSU,
with enhanced opportunities for teaching and mentoring. Specifically, we aim to provide (1) MARC students
with a structured learning community designed to facilitate and enhance professional bonds that will enable
them to learn and develop skills necessary to be successful in future biomedical careers; (2) mentored
research experiences coupled with programs and experiences that will enhance the academic program
success of MARC students; and (3) all MARC students with a clear structure for transitioning from
undergraduate training to graduate school and biomedical careers. These activities are intended to provide
opportunities for student trainees to develop skills in basic college proficiencies, presentation, teaching, and
mentoring that will not only maintain their focus on career goals, but also develop professional skills that they
will use in their future careers. We propose to build on the successes of our long-established R25 program with
modifications based on an evolving demographic and social culture of our students. The proposed program will
provide academic development and research experience at a large, urban, research institution with an
extremely diverse student population to a more personal level for our trainees."
10794407,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the epicenter of the global HIV
epidemic, have carried the primary burden of new HIV infections in this area for at least 30 years. Research
has prioritized characterizing the individual predictors of HIV infection among AGYW by creating risk
assessment tools that identify high-risk sub-populations for targeted HIV prevention efforts. Despite substantial
efforts, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease among this vulnerable population, suggesting a
need to identify and assess targets of intervention beyond the individual. The primary goals of this R36
dissertation proposal, Moving Beyond the Individual: A Data-driven Approach to Informing the Evidence on the
Role of Community and Societal Determinants of HIV among Adolescent Girls and Young Women in Sub-
Saharan Africa, are to create a comprehensive data source that will facilitate new ways of assessing HIV risk
among AGYW, generating improved knowledge about individual, interpersonal, community, and societal risk
factors; to characterize the interplay among these variables; and to assess the impact of interventions that
target community and societal drivers of infection to inform improved prevention efforts. To achieve these
goals, we propose three aims that will leverage publicly available, population-based data from five countries in
SSA (Cameroon, Eswatini, Malawi, Rwanda, and Uganda) and apply advanced data science and
epidemiologic methodologies. Aim 1 is to integrate publicly available data from the Population-based HIV
Impact Assessment Project (individual, interpersonal, community), the Population and Housing Census
(community), and UNAIDS Law and Policy Indicators (societal) to create a large, multi-level public health
dataset. Aim 2 is to characterize and graphically depict the pathways among individual, interpersonal,
community, and societal risk factors of HIV infection among AGYW using causal discovery algorithms to
identify underlying disease pathways. Aim 3 is to estimate the impact of intervening on community and societal
drivers of HIV infection among AGYW using parametric g-computation to model proposed intervention effects.
To examine these aims, we will take a novel, intersectional approach to assess HIV behavioral science
inquiries by leveraging causal discovery algorithms and g-computation. Findings from this research will
advance the National Institute of Mental Health Division of AIDS Research’s priority to improve the knowledge
base informing interventions, thereby advancing the development of interventions that go beyond the individual
to reduce the burden of HIV among AGYW. The research and mentorship of this R36 proposal have been
carefully crafted to optimize the ongoing doctoral training and research experience of the Principal Investigator
of this study while fostering her development as an African American independent research scientist in the
future."
10846613,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Nearly 40 million people in the United States annually are provided anesthesia for surgery. Reactive
aldehydes, produced during surgery, are toxic metabolites which drive cellular dysfunction and end organ
damage. For Asian Americans that are descents from East Asia a genetic variant (present in nearly 540
million people in the world) severely limits reactive aldehyde metabolism. Besides inefficient reactive aldehyde
metabolism, several other genetic differences occur for Asians within the lipid peroxidation pathway; a pathway
which regulates damage that occurs during organ injury. As mortality following surgery is the third leading
cause of death in the United States, with organ injury a major cause of this mortality, understanding how these
genetic differences in Asians may alter lipid peroxidation-induced organ damage could unlock novel treatment
strategies for all ethnicities to reduce organ injury occurring during surgery.
For this MIRA program, we will study the genetic differences existing within the lipid peroxidation pathway for
Asians, including the genetic variant which causes inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and the impact on
organ injury. To carry out these studies, we generated tools to study reactive aldehydes in the basic science
laboratory including a knock-in mouse model to reflect the human genetic variant that causes inefficient
reactive aldehyde metabolism and sensitive assays to detect reactive aldehydes. We will use these tools to
examine whether an analgesic given during surgery exacerbates cellular injury for rodents with inefficient
aldehyde metabolism. Further, we will also study how reactive aldehydes may impact a transient receptor
potential channel to trigger organ injury. We also expanded these aldehyde tools by developing non-invasive
methods to assess reactive aldehyde levels in humans and methods to identify phenotypes for inefficient
reactive aldehyde metabolism. We plan to use these tools in humans undergoing surgery to identify people
with inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and monitor their aldehyde levels during surgery in real-time.
Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States and are projected to reach
nearly 34 million by the year 2050. Asian Americans will require specific anesthetic plans for surgeries due to
genetic differences in the lipid peroxidation pathway, including genetics which cause inefficient reactive
aldehyde metabolism. Providing precision medical care for people who require surgery with this genetic
variant will ultimately reduce health care costs and improve quality of care for a large subset of Asian
Americans. As we describe here, studying genetic differences can also provide insight into biological
mechanisms and unlock novel strategies that can impact medical care for people of all ethnicities."
10830937,"ABSTRACT
Patients with HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer (~14% of breast cancer patients) have a high risk of
developing brain metastases (34%). The development of novel HER2 targeting agents has revolutionized the
treatment of patients with HER2+ breast cancer; however, the efficacy of these targeted drugs is very limited
when there is disease in the brain because the blood-brain-barrier/blood-tumor-barrier (BBB/BTB) hinders drug
delivery, and the brain microenvironment confers drug resistance even when the drugs accrue in tumors. Thus,
overcoming both the BBB/BTB and identifying unique brain-specific targets is required to improve the response
of breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) which are otherwise effective therapies.
We discovered that lipid synthesis is a metabolic requirement for breast cancer cells to grow in the brain. The
expression and activity of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a lipogenic enzyme, in breast cancer cells is significantly
increased in breast tumors in the brain when compared to extracranial sites. Our preliminary findings suggest that
there is a limited lipid availability in the brain, making cancer cells dependent on de novo synthesis to proliferate
in this site. Disrupting FASN expression in preclinical models of HER2+ BCBM decreased tumor progression in
mice with brain lesions but not mammary fat pad or liver tumors. Blocking lipid synthesis also improved the
efficacy of HER2 signaling inhibitors in vitro. Based on our preliminary findings we hypothesize that the limited
availability of lipids in the brain leads to dependenc eon de novo synthesis and creates a targetable metabolic
liability.
We propose to unravel the mechanisms involved in allowing metabolic adaptation to the brain microenvironment
and improve the treatment of HER2+ BCBM. In Aim 1, we will examine the nutrient limitations in brain that
may increase lipid synthesis in BCBM. In Aim 2, we will identify brain-specific metabolic liabilities by
investigating lipid metabolism in BCBM. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will determine the effects of targeting FASN alone,
or in combination with HER2-axis targeted therapies, on improving the treatment outcome. We will use focused
ultrasound (FUS) to improve drug delivery to BCBM. To realize these aims, we have developed clinically relevant
animal models, optimized FUS protocol, and designed methods to study cancer metabolism in vivo and ex vivo to
provide molecular, cellular, and functional insights into cancer metabolism. These innovative approaches and the
unique collective expertise of our multidisciplinary team will allow us to uncover how lipid metabolism governs
BCBM progression, and to leverage this insight to improve BCBM treatment."

In humans, neutralizing antibodies elicited by HIV-1 coevolve with viral Envs in distinctive patterns, in some
cases acquiring substantial breadth. We found that primary HIV-1 Envs, when expressed by simian-human
immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) in 22 rhesus macaques (RMs), elicited patterns of Env-Ab coevolution
strikingly similar to those in humans (Science 371:eabd2638, 2021). This included conserved immunogenetic,
structural and chemical solutions to epitope recognition and precise Env-amino acid substitutions, insertions and
deletions leading to virus persistence. The structure of one rhesus antibody, capable of neutralizing 49% of a
208-strain panel, revealed a V2-apex mode of recognition like that of human bNAbs PGT145 and PCT64. We
subsequently expanded this study to include 150 RMs infected by SHIVs bearing any of 15 different primary
HIV-1 Envs; 24 (16%) of these animals developed bNAbs targeting conserved V2 apex, V3 glycan, CD4bs or
fusion peptide epitopes. The V2 apex was the most common bNAb epitope targeted in RMs. We concluded that
Env-Ab coevolution in RMs recapitulates developmental features of human bNAbs and may serve to guide and
accelerate HIV-1 immunogen design for humans. From these preclinical data, we identified HIV-1 Q23.17 Env
as the immunogen that most consistently elicited V2 apex bNAbs. Here, we propose to elucidate the Env-Ab
coevolutionary pathways by which HIV-1 Q23.17 Env selectively primes, boosts and affinity-matures V2 apex
bNAb responses and to translate these findings into an all-SOSIP Env trimer vaccine regimen consisting of a
germline-targeted Q23.17 Env prime followed by boosts with lineage-designed Q23.17 Env “imunotypes”
capable of affinity-maturing B cells to achieve breadth. Specific aims are: (i) to decipher molecular pathways of
Env-Ab coevolution in SHIV.Q23.17 infected RMs that lead to the development of V2 apex bNAbs, including the
identification of inferred germline bNAb precursors and lineage intermediates and corresponding Env
immunotypes that bind to them; (ii) to use mammalian display saturation mutagenesis to generate Q23.17 Env
variants that exhibit enhanced binding affinity to multiple rhesus germline V2 apex bNAb B cell precursors and
to engineer these Envs as nanoparticle-delivered SOSIP trimers; (iii) to test the immunogenicity of germline-
targeted and lineage-designed Q23.17 Env SOSIP trimers in V2 apex bNAb UCA knockin mice and outbred
RMs and to advance the most promising combinations to a proof-of-concept preclinical vaccine trial in RMs; and
(iv) to conduct an appropriately powered preclinical vaccine trial in 28 RMs to test the hypothesis that reverse-
engineered, B lineage-designed Q23.17 SOSIP Env trimers can prime, boost and affinity mature V2 apex bNAb
responses in RMs to an extent that is superior to conventional SOSIP Env immunogens and that protects RMs
from heterologous virus challenge. The significance of these studies could be far-reaching: if we can demonstrate
consistent induction of bNAbs using germline-targeted, lineage-designed Q23.17 Env SOSIPs in RMs, it would
represent a new beachhead for HIV-1 vaccine research that could be translated rapidly into human clinical trials."
10829430,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) generates Ca2+ signals that are critical for many physiological processes,
from immune cell activation and differentiation to muscle activity, secretion, and motility. Store-operated Ca2+
channels (SOCs) are activated by receptors that deplete Ca2+ from the ER; the loss of Ca2+ is sensed by STIM1,
which then accumulates at ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions where it binds, traps, and activates
calcium-selective Orai channels diffusing in the PM. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in this
pathway have both been connected to serious human diseases, underscoring the critical importance of precise
regulation. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand the molecular basis of SOC properties and
regulation as well as their cellular roles. While the overall organization of the SOCE pathway is now known and
many of the underlying proteins have been identified, major gaps still exist in our understanding of how they act
to regulate SOCE location and amplitude. Over the next five years we aim to investigate three fundamental
processes that regulate calcium influx through SOCs. (1) The dynamics of ER-PM junctions. These junctions
where the ER closely approaches the PM are the only sites in the cell where STIM can bind and activate Orai,
such that their size, abundance and location determine both the amplitude and location of Ca2+ entry. While a
host of tethering proteins at junctional sites is known, their specific roles in junction initiation vs. turnover is
unclear. By monitoring the appearance and removal of ER-PM junctions in living cells with fluorescent markers
we will distinguish the different contributions of known tethering proteins to the initiation, lifetime and turnover
rate of new junctions, as well as their ability to conduct SOCE. (2) The mechanism of STIM1 activation and its
interaction with Orai1. The cytosolic domain of STIM1 undergoes a massive conformational change after ER
Ca2+ depletion in order to unmask and extend the CRAC activation domain (CAD) to activate Orai in the plasma
membrane. By studying STIM1 with single-molecule fluorescence and crosslinking techniques we aim to identify
steps in the activation process and intermediate states that may help mitigate the energetic cost of unfolding and
refolding STIM1. Similar approaches will be applied to determine basic features of the STIM-Orai interaction -
the stoichiometry of the STIM-Orai complex, the conformation of CAD in the bound state, and the binding
interface itself – which are currently not understood. (3) A molecular mechanism for Ca2+-dependent inactivation
(CDI). Despite progress in identifying multiple residues and domains in STIM and Orai that are critical for CDI,
an integrated mechanism is still lacking. We will use a pore accessibility assay to localize the position of the
inactivation gate, and explore functional and physical interactions of CDI domains to understand how they
cooperate to bring about CDI. Overall, the results of our studies will reveal fundamental cellular and molecular
mechanisms that control the strength of store-operated calcium signals in diverse cells, and may suggest new
strategies for regulating them to explore cellular functions and develop new treatments for human disease."
10814811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Much of our understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation derives from studies of simple traits in which a
large proportion of the phenotypic variation is controlled by one or a few genes of major effect. However, much
of evolution involves changes in complex traits that are controlled by many genes of small to modest effect.
Complex traits also underlie most phenotypic differences among humans, including those related to human
health. The proposed research will study the genetic basis of environmental adaptation in house mice, Mus
musculus, the best mammalian model for humans. House mice have recently expanded into the Americas from
their native range in Western Europe. By combining studies of genetic and phenotypic variation in natural
populations and in the lab, this project will make explicit links between genotype and phenotype for several
complex traits. This work will utilize recent large-scale surveys of 28 populations of house mice collected
across the Americas from 55° S latitude to 54° N latitude. New inbred lines of mice from different environments
form a critical resource for the proposed work. Mice from colder environments have evolved to become larger
(Bergmann’s rule) and have shorter extremities (Allen’s rule), conforming to two of the best-documented eco-
geographic patterns in mammals. In addition, mice from different environments differ in many metabolic traits,
including activity levels, body mass index, and aspects of blood chemistry. We have two major goals for the
next five years. First, we will identify the genetic architecture and specific loci underlying complex adaptive
traits using (1) QTL mapping with wild-derived inbred lines of mice from different environments, (2) expression
studies, including the identification of cis-eQTL, to identify specific genes within broad QTL intervals, (3)
studies of chromatin accessibility to identify potential regulatory changes, (4) association studies of traits in
large samples of mice from natural populations, and (5) studies of inbred lines reared in different laboratory
environments to measure the effects of environmental perturbations on both gene expression and organismal-
level traits. Second, we will expand on our previous work studying patterns of SNP variation of wild mice by
using a combination of long-read PacBio sequencing of mice from natural populations and long-read PacBio
sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding of genomes from wild-derived inbred strains to study structural variation
across the genome, including (1) copy-number variation contributing to environmental adaptation, (2)
transposable element insertion polymorphisms underlying adaptive differences, and (3) larger structural
variants such as inversion polymorphisms. The impact of structural variation on gene expression will be
assessed using RNAseq from the same animals. Together this combination of approaches will provide an
unparalleled picture of the genomic details underlying polygenic adaptation in mice and will identify the genetic
basis of traits likely to be relevant for understanding differences among humans."
10828844,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multi-organ failure as a result of the systemic inflammatory response to injury (SIRS) is the leading cause
of late complications and death after severe trauma and burn injury. Despite decades of research,
therapeutics that limit the SIRS response following injury remains an unmet clinical need. Emerging
research points to the contribution of human-specific differences in our immune system that distinguish
the human injury response from that observed in other species. These species-specific differences may
explain why therapies that are widely successful in animal models used for preclinical research fail in
human clinical studies. Uniquely human genes (UHGs), with expression that frequently tracks to human
immune cells, may account for some of these differences in human SIRS after injury. The overarching
goal of my research program is to systematically define factors that distinguish the human immune
response from other species, characterize the contribution of UHGs to human SIRS, and understand how
these genes effect therapeutics that target anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. To this end, we have
recently discovered a novel role for the uniquely human CHRFAM7A gene that is a variant of the
conserved α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) that mediates cholinergic anti-inflammatory
signaling. In addition to decreasing the ability of therapeutics to target the α7nAchR, unexpectedly, we
have demonstrated that human CHRFAM7A expression functions in transgenic mouse mice to cause
increased monocyte mobilization to lung and decreased acute lung injury in a model of severe burn injury.
Our research focus in this MIRA proposal is to identify the function and mechanism of action of UHGs
that are highly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and relevant in the injury response. To
demonstrate the functional relevance of UHGs, we will use a combination of precision animal models,
genetic approaches in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and clinical samples from trauma and
burn patients. In this research program, we propose to 1) test cell-specific UHG function in an animal
model of severe injury; 2) develop an iPS cell system for mechanistic studies in human macrophages; 3)
determine how UHGs alter the effect of therapeutics that target anti-inflammatory signaling pathways;
and 4) evaluate how relative UHG expression alters the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes from
injured patients. Understanding how UHGs make the human immune response to injury unique may allow
for the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating SIRS and decreasing organ
dysfunction after severe trauma and burn."
10840834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Humans and well-established research organisms lack the ability to regenerate their reproductive cells (germ
cells) and reproductive organs. Research findings from these organisms established the current view that germ
cells are a distinct lineage separated from the soma; therefore, the loss of germ cells renders an organism infertile
because new germ cells cannot be derived from the soma. Contradicting this widely accepted view is the fact
that many organisms (e.g. hydra, flatworms, segmented worms, and sea stars) can readily regenerate germ
cells. However, the cellular source of regenerated germ cells in these organisms is very poorly understood. The
goal of my laboratory is to close this knowledge gap and define the cellular origins and molecular
mechanisms of germ cell regeneration. Addressing this is not feasible using established research organisms
like mice, fruit flies, and nematodes, because they do not regenerate germ cells. Furthermore, many of the
organisms that can regenerate germ cells are not conducive to studying the mechanisms of this process because
they lack transgenic tools, or their anatomies present technical challenges such as large and opaque bodies, or
inaccessibility of reproductive organs. These limitations prevent the use of live imaging – a key tool to trace the
lineages of germ cells and their source cells. We use a segmented worm, Platynereis dumerilii, for studying germ
cell regeneration. Platynereis is well-suited for this study because germ cell regeneration can be induced and is
achieved quickly; transcriptome databases, a draft genome, and transgenic tools (critical for genetic lineage
tracing) are available; and a small and transparent body makes it excellent for live imaging. Therefore,
Platynereis is a research organism that presents a rare opportunity to combine the modern techniques
required to study germ cell regeneration (live-imaging, genetic lineage tracing, transcriptomics) in the
relevant post-embryonic life stages (i.e. juveniles, adults) which are typically challenging to image live.
We postulate three possible models for the cellular sources for the regenerated germ cells: 1) pluri/multipotent
stem cells regenerate both somatic and germ cells; 2) a lineage-restricted cell population is dedicated to
regenerating only the germ cells; or 3) somatic cells transdifferentiate into germ cells by reprogramming. Our
experimental approach will be to: a) Test between the three cellular models of germ cell regeneration via genetic
cell lineage tracing and live imaging. This will allow us to identify the exact cell lineages that give rise to germ
cells during development and regeneration. b) Identify the molecular changes taking place during reprogramming
source cells into germ cells by single cell RNA sequencing. This will allow us to obtain transcriptome trajectories
over the course of regeneration and identify cell type-specific markers in the source cells, the intermediate states,
and the new germ cells. These markers will be tested for function in future studies. The project will significantly
contribute to our fundamental understanding of germ cell biology and the soma-germ cell distinction."
10807022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular proliferation increases demand for ribonucleotide pools to provide precursors for increased RNA, DNA,
and membrane synthesis. This demand exceeds the capacity of uptake and salvage pathways, and must be
met by increased de novo biosynthesis. In particular, lymphocyte proliferation is dependent on increased
nucleotide levels, and targeting nucleotide biosynthesis pathways is the basis for a number of highly successful
immunosuppressive treatments. CTP Synthase (CTPS) is the key regulatory enzyme in pyrimidine nucleotide
biosynthesis. Humans have two CTPS isoforms encoded on separate genes, CTPS1 and CTPS2. While
CTPS1 expression is generally increased in proliferative tissues, little else is known about differential roles of
the two isoforms or how they are regulated. CTPS1 plays a critical role in the immune response, and loss of
function mutations in humans cause severe immunodeficiency. Loss of CTPS1 results in impaired T and B-cell
proliferation, but does not have deleterious effects in other human tissues, indicating unique dependence of the
immune response on CTPS1 function. Selective inhibition of CTPS1, therefore, is considered a potentially
powerful approach to immunosuppressive therapies with limited off-target effects. A number of inhibitors that
specifically target CTPS1 have recently been reported, but the mechanisms of inhibition remain unclear. Here,
we focus on the structural and functional characterization of CTPS1 and CTPS2 regulation by native allosteric
regulators and by selective small molecule inhibitors. This work will provide insight into the control of nucleotide
biosynthesis during cellular proliferation, and serve as the basis for design and targeted discovery of novel
compounds with potential for immunosuppressive therapies."
10922675,"SUMMARY: Cannabis use in the US has alarmingly quadrupled in recent years: from 8.9% in 2016 to 17.5% in
2019 in individuals of age 12+ that used Cannabis in the last year. Thus, it is critical that we better understand
the bioactivity of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary intoxicating compound in Cannabis. THC activates
cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1R) and impairs several behaviors, including spontaneous locomotion. While it is
known that THC reduces spontaneous locomotion in mice, the neural-circuit basis and involvement of the
endocannabinoid (eCB), 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), of this response remains largely unexplored. Using a
novel 2-AG sensor (eCB2.0) expressed in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) neurons, we discovered a tight correlation
between increase in 2-AG levels, calcium transients and initiation of spontaneous locomotion. Remarkably, both
2-AG and GCaMP6f calcium transients were significantly greater in THC-treated mice compared to vehicle-
treated mice, and the number of initiated locomotion events greatly reduced as a function of the hypolocomotion
response. Our hypothesis is that 2-AG activates CB1R’s on select PrL GABAergic interneuron subpopulations,
which disinhibits the glutamatergic activity within the PrL to control the initiation of spontaneous locomotion, and
THC potentiates this mechanism.
■ Aim 1 will determine how THC preferentially modulates the physiological activity of select GABAergic
subpopulations and glutamatergic neurons in the PrL. We will use RNAscope in situ hybridization to map CB1R
expression in GABAergic interneurons (GABA-IN’s) in the PrL. Combining GABA-IN-Cre lines with viral
techniques and channel-rhodopsin assisted circuit mapping with slice electrophysiology, we will determine how
2-AG’s action at CB1-R in PFC changes synaptic transmission and how this is impacted by THC.
■ Aim 2 will utilize in vivo fiber photometry and optogenetic manipulation of GABA-IN-Cre and VGLUT-Cre mice
expressing cre-dependent GCaMP6f or eCB2.0 in mouse PrL to record changes in neuronal activity and 2-AG
levels of inhibitory and excitatory neurons during spontaneous locomotion of mice treated with increasing doses
of THC. We will determine the specific 2-AG signaling components involved in this response using selective
pharmacological inhibitors. We will also virally express a CRISPR-CB1R construct to eliminate CB1R from GABA-
IN’s and glutamatergic neurons to establish the involvement of this target. Based on this premise, we will test
the hypothesis that select subpopulations of GABA-IN’s mediate changes in PrL activity associated with increase
in 2-AG levels and control of spontaneous locomotion. To determine the necessity and sufficiency of PrL activity
in THC treated mice, we will optogenetically stimulated or inhibited GABA-IN’s and glutamatergic neurons and
measured changes in spontaneous locomotion in vehicle and THC-treated mice.
This exploratory R21 grant proposal provides an ideal mechanisms and scientific foundation for studies aimed
at deciphering the mechanisms by which eCBs modulates PrL activity and how THC impairs locomotor behavior."

Vascular access is both the Lifeline and the Achilles heel for the 500,000+ patients on hemodialysis in
the United States (3million+ worldwide). Thus, while arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) have good long-term
patency, they also have a high maturation failure rate due to a venous segment stenosis which results
in multiple interventional procedures, and a prolonged period of catheter (CVC) use, with all its
attendant complications. Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) in contrast, have good early function but develop
a later stenosis at the graft-vein anastomosis. Despite the very significant morbidity, mortality and
economic cost (over 5 billion USD annually) associated with vascular access dysfunction, there are
currently no effective therapies for this huge and unmet clinical need.
We believe that the current situation mandates a disruptive innovation approach. Thus, we have
recently developed biodegradable vessel scaffolds with a unique polymer composition (poly [glycerol
sebacate] – polycaprolactone with palmitate [PPGS-PCL]) that (a) promotes active cellular and matrix
integration (b) generates an asymmetric thickness and diameter from the arterial to venous end to avoid
compliance mismatch and (c) displays self-sealing properties for early cannulation and rapid CVC
removal.
The central hypothesis of this proposal, therefore, is that the modulation of biomaterial characteristics
(composition and fiber orientation) and scaffold configuration (changes in diameter, thickness and
compliance between the arterial and venous ends) of a bioengineered INtegrated Vascular Access
Conduit (IN-VAC), will influence hemodynamic stressors (shear and pulsatility) and cell-matrix
integration, resulting in a “living-breathing” vascular conduit with optimized process of care
(cannulation), functional (flow), anatomic (stenosis) and histological (morphometry) end points, in
clinically relevant (with and without uremia) pig models of arteriovenous access. We plan to address
this central hypothesis through the following specific aims:
In Specific Aim 1, we will design, produce, and test a variety of IN-VAC devices in-vitro. In Specific Aim
2, we aim to assess safety and biocompatibility, and also optimize the impact of upstream engineering
and biophysical profiles on downstream clinical endpoints. Finally in Specific Aim 3, we will assess the
optimized IN-VAC device for clinical efficacy against the AcusealTM graft, in the setting of both uremic
and non-uremic pig models of arteriovenous stenosis.
In summary, this proposal combines our hemodynamic, vascular biology and bioengineering strengths,
to both advance our mechanistic understanding of vascular access biology, and to create a unique and
innovative vascular conduit. We believe that such a device could significantly reduce the morbidity,
mortality and economic cost associated with both hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction and (in the
future) coronary, carotid, and peripheral vascular disease, all of which are extremely prevalent within
our veteran population."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global health crisis. Currently effective vaccines are available to prevent SARS-
CoV-2 infection, but our options for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain limited. To inform the
development of innovative interventions designed to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, we need a better
understanding of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the host dependency factors that are
required for virus infection. We have performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and identified PCBD1,
TRAF3, and RAD54L2 as novel host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our preliminary data showed
that PCBD1, TRAF3, and RAD54L2 are required for the transcription of angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2). ACE2 is the primary receptor for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, and plays key roles in virus infection
and pathogenesis. ACE2 is differentially expressed in a wide variety of human tissues. However, the molecular
basis for the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 in different tissues remains unexplored, which constitutes a clear
knowledge gap in SARS-CoV-2 research. In Aim 1, we will determine the function of PCBD1, TRAF3, and
RAD54L2 in transcriptional regulation of ACE2 in four cell lines derived from different tissues: Vero E6 (monkey
kidney), Calu-3 (human lung), C2BBe1 (human large intestine), and HK-2 (human kidney). SARS-CoV-2
continuously evolves by genetic mutations for the adaption to the host. We identified a number of mutations in
Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) that may enhance the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cells expressed low levels
of ACE2. Some mutation (such as N S194L) was prevalent in India and Mexico during early circulation,
suggesting these variants may contribute to the viral adaption to the host. In Aim 2, we will analyze the function
of Spike (N81S, L242P, E484D, and P1079T) and Nucleocapsid (S194L) variants in virion production and cell
entry of SARS-CoV-2. Our proposed studies will provide new information regarding the transcriptional regulation
of ACE2 and the adaption of SARS-CoV-2. In the long term, these studies will provide new targets and strategies
for the development of antiviral drugs."
10817856,"Babesiosis is a malaria-like illness found worldwide and endemic in the United States. The disease is caused
by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus Babesia. Babesia microti and Babesia duncani, which are
responsible for most cases reported in the United States, are transmitted to humans by Ixodes scapularis and
Dermacentor albipictus ticks, respectively, and can also be introduced by blood transfusion. The current
treatment for human babesiosis consists of combination therapies with atovaquone+azithromycin or
clindamycin+quinine. However, these drugs are associated with high rate of recrudescence, treatment failures
and adverse events. Furthermore, recent studies in mice infected with B. microti and in vitro with B. duncani
showed that these parasites are naturally tolerant to these drugs. These limitations emphasize the need for
more effective and safer therapies for treatment of human babesiosis. We have recently reported the
development of a continuous in vitro culture system for B. duncani in human red blood cells. Using this assay,
we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified fosinopril (the prodrug of the dipeptidyl
carboxypeptidase ACE inhibitor fosinoprilat) as a potent antibabesial inhibitor. The compound was also
effective against both B. duncani and B. microti in mouse models of babesiosis at 10 mg/kg. Interestingly,
neither fosinoprilat nor other ACE inhibitors affected the growth of B. duncani in vitro. Equally interesting,
analysis of the structure of fosinopril and bortezomib (another potent inhibitor of B. duncani identified in the
chemical screen and a known proteasome inhibitor) revealed similarities between the two compounds.
Together these data suggest that the antibabesial activity of fosinopril could be due to inhibition of either an
ACE-like peptidase and/or a proteasome activity of Babesia parasites. The primary goals of this application
are to identify analogs of fosinopril with more potent antibabesial but no ACE activity, and to elucidate the
mechanism of action of these compounds in Babesia parasites. Building upon our preliminary data, we
propose the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether or not the prodrug form of
fosinopril is the active compound, and characterize the efficacy of fosinopril and newly synthesized analogs
against B. duncani and B. microti clinical and field isolates in vitro and examine the structure activity
relationship specific to these parasites. In Aim 2, we will characterize the in vivo efficacy of the most active
compounds alone or in combination with other drugs as a strategy for elimination of Babesia infections. In Aim
3, we will implement biochemical, mass spectrometry and genetic assays to elucidate the mode of action of
and possible mechanisms of Babesia resistance to fosinopril and its analogs. The success of the proposed
three aims will guide future clinical trials to create an ideal regimen for the treatment of human babesiosis with
no recrudescence."
10828889,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Bacterial adhesion to the urinary tract epithelium is a critical step in establishing urinary tract infections. During
infection of the mammalian bladder (cystitis), uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are well described to
employ type 1 pili, bearing the tip adhesin FimH, to bind oligomannose-decorated uroplakins that coat the
luminal surfaces of superficial bladder epithelial cells. However, less detail is known about host-pathogen
interactions in the kidney that enable initiation of upper-tract UTIs, including pyelonephritis and renal abscess.
We have found that type 1 pili, previously thought to be essential only in cystitis, also mediate establishment of
pyelonephritis and the initiation of renal abscesses in C3H mice. Furthermore, in an in vitro model of UPEC
binding to renal collecting duct epithelium, we identified a candidate renal epithelial receptor for FimH, namely
the mannosylated cell-junctional protein desmoglein-2 (Dsg2). This protein is expressed throughout the
nephron but most highly in collecting duct epithelium, and bears typical N-linked mannose-containing glycans
as well as cadherin family-specific O-linked mannosylation. In this project, we will test the central hypothesis
that desmoglein-2 is an epithelial receptor for FimH that mediates establishment of UPEC pyelonephritis and
can bind FimH in gut and exfoliated bladder. First, we will use multiple genetic and pharmacologic systems to
interrogate the importance of FimH binding to mannosylated Dsg2 in recently published, optimized mouse
models of UPEC pyelonephritis. Among these systems will be newly generated C3H mice carrying renal
epithelial-specific deletion of Dsg2. Next, we will quantify the binding affinity of the FimH lectin domain to the
purified extracellular domain of human DSG2 by SPR, and co-crystallize the relevant FimH and DSG2 domains
to reveal the structural basis for the DSG2-FimH interaction. Controls in these experiments will include
FimHQ133K, which carries a mutation that abrogates mannose binding; mannosides, high-affinity small-molecule
inhibitors of FimH binding; enzymatic pre-treatment of purified protein and kidney tissue sections to eliminate
N- or O-linked glycans; and monoclonal antibodies generated against the key DSG2 peptides mediating
interaction with FimH. Third, desmoglein-2 is also expressed widely on other epithelial cell types (in both
humans and mice), raising the added possibility that it binds FimH in other niches relevant to UTI
pathogenesis. These include the bladder after exfoliation (a rapid response to initial UPEC infection that
eliminates the primary FimH receptor) and the colon (which serves as a UPEC reservoir to seed recurrent
UTI). Therefore, we will use mouse and human tissue sections, an in vivo gut colonization model, and
additional new conditional Dsg2 knockout mice to investigate whether Dsg2 can serve as a FimH receptor in
these tissues. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have specified a novel receptor for type 1 pili,
elucidated the structural basis of FimH interaction with desmoglein-2, and defined the functional roles of this
pharmacologically targetable interaction in multiple UTI-relevant niches."

Congenital hearing loss affects 1 in 500 newborns, making it the most common sensory disorder in humans.
Children with hearing loss are at risk for poor speech, language, and social development with noted negative
effects on quality of life. The most effective treatment for severe-to-profound hearing loss in children is cochlear
implantation. The cochlear implant (CI) is the most successful and widely used sensory prosthesis in humans
and cochlear implantation has restored hearing to hundreds of thousands around the world. While the majority
of CI users experience significant improvement in speech perception, a significant portion do not. There is a
critical need to identify individuals at-risk for poor outcomes prior to cochlear implantation in order to: (1) provide
accurate pre-operative counseling, (2) tailor post-operative care, and (3) develop new treatment strategies for
these types of hearing loss. To date, the best predictors of CI speech perception outcomes rely on complex
statistical modeling of clinical factors associated with hearing loss or intra-operative electrocochleography
(ECoG), neither of which can be routinely used pre-operatively. There is increasing evidence that specific genetic
variations that negatively affect the health of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are associated with worse
postoperative CI speech perception outcomes. The primary goal of this grant proposal is to better understand
genetic contributors to postoperative speech perception outcomes in children. We recently showed that
variations in the gene TMPRSS3 are associated with worse CI speech perception outcomes. Although
TMPRSS3 is one of the most common causes of genetic hearing loss, the function of the TMPRSS3 protein and
the mechanism by which it causes hearing loss are not known. TMPRSS3 is involved in expression of calcium-
sensitive potassium channels in inner hair cells. A knock-out mouse model shows rapid hair cell degeneration
soon after the onset of hearing. However, deafness-causing mutations in TMPRSS3 are notable for causing not
only a severe-to-profound congenital hearing loss (DFNB10) but also a later onset post-lingual hearing loss
(DFNB8). In addition, the expression of TMPRSS3 includes hair cells and also SGNs. We hypothesize that
TMPRSS3 has functions in the inner hair cells as well as in the SGN. The aims of this project are to: (1) examine
the complex interplay between genetics, ECoG, and post-operative speech perception scores in children with
CIs, (2) improve our understanding of TMPRSS3 through development of a new mouse model for late onset
DFNB8 hearing loss, and (3) develop a new gene therapy for TMPRSS3 hearing loss. The expected results of
this study will be: (1) a genetic risk index for poor CI outcomes in children, (2) a better understanding of the
function of TMPRSS3 in hearing and hearing loss, and (3) a novel gene therapy for TMPRSS3 hearing loss. The
results of this study will have direct clinical impact as well as pave the way for future gene therapy trials in
humans."
10839309,"The Chook Laboratory aims to understand mechanisms of how Karyopherin- proteins recognize
binding partners and map partner/cargo repertoires. We aim to understand nuclear-cytoplasmic
transport, other karyopherin functions, and discover how they organize and regulate cellular functions, in
health and in disease. 20 homologous human and 14 S. cerevisiae Kaps mediate the majority of nuclear
transport. We have studied the importin Karyopherin-β2 extensively. We discovered the PY-NLS that it
recognizes, characterized the physical organization of this signal and designed the first nuclear import
inhibitor. Karyopherin-β2 and other well-characterized importins, Importin-/β, Importin-5 and
Transportin-SR, have distinct specificities and bind entirely different NLS types. However, the remaining
importins: Importin-4, Importin-7, Importin-8, Importin-9 and Importin-11, are under-studied with few
known cargos. Scarcity of cargos has prevented comparative biochemical/structural definition of their
NLSs. We aim to discover new cargos and classes of NLSs for understudied importins and map the
traffic they control. We showed that in addition to importing cargos, importins also act as chaperones to
prevent aggregation of RNA-binding proteins or act as histone chaperone to prevent histone H2A-H2B
aggregation and assist in nucleosome assembly. We will address the mechanism of Kap2 chaperone
functions, and how Kap114 imports and chaperones H2A-H2B in the presence of canonical histone
chaperones. In the study of nuclear export, we have contributed significantly to the understanding of
how CRM1 binds NESs and small molecule inhibitors, but there are many more questions given CRM1’s
importance in many cellular processes and disease states. CRM1 inhibitor Selinexor causes apoptosis
of cancer cells, but it is not known which cargos are targeted in different cancers. Most of the >1000
NES-containing CRM1 cargos are not known. Accurate NES prediction could help identify new cargos,
but diverse NES sequences and vague consensus that describes sequences ubiquitous in most helix-
containing proteins make sequence-based NES prediction inefficient. To improve prediction, we are
developing a structure- and energy-based NES predictor. We will also study how CRM1 is degraded in
response to inhibitors, understand how the oncogenic E571K mutation of CRM1 affects NES-binding
and CRM1-mediated traffic, and study CRM1-mediated mRNA export. Finally, we will expand our study
to the exportin Msn5, which binds intrinsically disordered and phosphorylated segments of multiple
cargos, hence an excellent system to define a new NES class."

Segregation of DNA into open euchromatin and more condensed heterochromatin is fundamental to eukaryotic
genome organization. Chromatin accessibility influences cell-fate choice in development and its dysregulation
is common in disease. While the presence of euchromatic and heterochromatic compartments has been
appreciated for over a century, we still know almost nothing about the mechanisms that drive the initial, rapid
fractionation of genomes into these distinct domains during embryogenesis. Moreover, although we and others
have shown that the large-scale de novo establishment of heterochromatin is tightly linked to the onset of
zygotic gene expression in animals, the transcriptional consequences of accelerating or delaying
heterochromatin establishment during this early window of vertebrate development are not known. My
laboratory focuses on Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethyl (H3K9me3) marked heterochromatin, which forms the
major blocks of heterochromatin in vertebrates. H3K9me3 marked heterochromatin is required for the silencing
of transposons, suppression of inappropriate recombination, proper chromosome segregation and appropriate
transcription of developmentally important genes. Here, we propose an innovative program combining genetic,
genomic and molecular biology approaches, which seeks to uncover the mechanisms that control the large-
scale de novo establishment of H3K9me3 marked heterochromatin during early vertebrate embryogenesis and
to define the consequences of shifting the timing of heterochromatin establishment in the embryo. We choose
zebrafish as a model because there are clear parallels between heterochromatin regulation in zebrafish and in
mammals, and because external fertilization of the zebrafish embryo facilitates the molecular interrogation of
chromatin in very early development. Over the course of our studies, we will elucidate the functions of several
newly identified regulators of heterochromatin establishment, test requirements for zygotic transcripts in
directing de novo heterochromatin formation and clarify the relationship between 5-methylcytosine and
H3K9me3 in early embryogenesis. We will also identify early developmental programs that are impacted by
altering the timeline of heterochromatin establishment in the embryo. This research is significant, as it
addresses critical and long-standing knowledge gaps in our understanding of heterochromatin formation and
function during early vertebrate embryogenesis. Understanding how heterochromatin is first established during
development, and its functions in regulating early transcription is necessary for us to understand how
heterochromatin misregulation contributes to disease, and how we might intervene to reset aberrant chromatin
states using targeted therapies."
10840990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Language impairments in children have a persistent, lifelong impact on social communication, academic
performance, and adaptive behaviors. Two clinical groups particularly impacted by language impairments
include developmental language disorder (DLD) and fragile X syndrome (FXS). DLD affects 7-13% of school-
age children, and is characterized by pervasive impairments in the grammatical system in the absence of an
intellectual disability. Fragile X is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and males with FXS
have significant language impairments. Notably, there is a significant overlap in the language phenotype
between DLD and FXS, in terms of grammatical production. This is striking given the difference in general
cognitive abilities. Importantly, nothing is known regarding areas of overlap and distinction in grammatical
comprehension between the two disorders. Additionally, although these two clinical groups have very different
cognitive profiles in terms of IQ, there are overlaps in other aspects of cognition, namely executive function.
This is particularly interesting, given evidence of a relationship between executive function and language skills
during typical development as well as in children with DLD, however, this work is nonexistent in FXS.
Comparative studies between disorders with known (FXS) and unknown (DLD) etiology have the potential to
inform both theory and clinical practice. Thus, the proposed study has three specific aims designed to
systematically investigate areas of overlap and distinction in terms of language with a focus on grammatical
production and comprehension and the association with executive function in children with DLD and FXS in a
developmental framework. Through careful investigations we will be able to determine the developmental
trajectories of grammatical comprehension and production in addition to EF skills in DLD, FXS, and a language
matched group of children with typical development. We will recruit children with DLD (n = 40), children with
FXS (n = 40), and children with typical development (n = 60). Children will be matched on clause length to
ensure similar language abilities. The proposed study will include a combination of standardized assessments,
language samples, experimental tasks, and parent report measures taken at two time points in order to track
growth and change during this critical period for grammatical development. The proposed study will yield key
information regarding children's comprehension of grammar, change over time, best assessment methods, and
critical information on the relationships between executive function and grammatical development. The data
collected in this study will be used to inform treatment studies designed to maximize both the effectiveness and
efficacy of language learning in DLD and FXS in targeted intervention studies."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is an increasingly common cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare
system. Though evidence-based OUD treatment exists, uptake is often poor; and those with OUD frequently
have profound health-related social needs that complicate their care. Improving OUD outcomes depends not
only on treatment efficacy, but also on optimizing the healthcare delivery and payment systems in which
efficacious treatments are deployed. Value-based care – a healthcare delivery and payment model that aims to
incentivize value rather than volume of care – represents a widespread approach to healthcare reform touted
for its potential to improve OUD care processes and outcomes. Despite this promise, however, large
knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of whether – and how – value-based care may promote quality
care for people with OUD. This K01 proposal therefore leverages an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of
value-based care delivery for OUD in the context of Massachusetts’ implementation of an innovative new
Medicaid accountable care organization (ACO) model of care. The Massachusetts Medicaid ACO program is
the first of its kind to base ACO payments not only on beneficiaries’ medical complexity, but also on behavioral
health and social complexity. The research aims are to use implementation of this novel ACO program as a
natural experiment to 1) assess the impact of value-based care reform on OUD care quality, 2) understand
whether current risk adjustment methods for setting ACO payments adequately cover costs of care for socially
complex patients with OUD and housing instability, and 3) develop a pilot risk adjustment model for OUD care
quality measures. The Principal Investigator, Dr. Heather Hsu, is an early career clinician-investigator with prior
research experience at the intersection of infectious disease epidemiology, health services research, and
value-based care. With this K01, she seeks to transition the clinical focus of her research to substance use,
focusing on developing content expertise in addiction healthcare delivery and advanced methodologic skills in
quasi-experimental study design and risk adjustment for quality and payment. Dr. Hsu will acquire these skills
and conduct the proposed research at Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine,
national leaders in addiction medicine and research and home to the largest group of Medicaid ACOs in
Massachusetts. The proposal is supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship and advisory team with expertise
in addiction medicine, substance use research, social determinants of health, advanced methods for causal
inference, health economics, econometrics, and risk adjustment. Training will be accomplished through an
intensive combination of formal coursework, workshops, field experience, applied research experience, guided
tutorials, and focused mentorship. At the end of the K01 award period, Dr. Hsu will be well-positioned to
accomplish her long-term goal to become an independent investigator and expert on improving value-based
healthcare delivery to persons with substance use disorders."
10889917,"Project Summary
Our overall objective is to elucidate the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in order to develop therapies to promote repair within lung
epithelium. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the incidence is rising globally.
Here, we seek to exploit regenerative pathways to confer protection and enhance repair within lung epithelium
following injuries that result in airspace simplification. We focus on HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) and its
receptor cMet based on the following : 1) HGF, is a pleiotrophic morphogen and the only known ligand for cMet,
a trophic growth factor receptor expressed on a variety of epithelial cell types, including alveolar type II cells
(AECII); 2) HGF/cMet enables morphogenic, motogenic, angiogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling, a complex
skill set especially directive of alveolar formation and repair; and 3) studies in our lab and others have
demonstrated reliable effects of this pathway on alveolar development and homeostasis. We previously reported
that the loss of cMet signaling in the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) compartment impairs alveolar formation via
enhanced oxidative stress, apoptosis and reduced vascularization. Augmentation of HGF signaling partially
reverses genetic emphysema and elastase-induced emphysema in preclinical models. However, the airspace
epithelial effects of HGF/cMet in response to cigarette smoke (CS) and the relevance to clinical lung disease are
still largely unknown. In preliminary data, we show that cMet is downregulated in COPD lungs, airspaces of
adult mice exposed to chronic CS and in both murine alveolar and human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to
CS. The neonatal loss of cMet signaling in the distal epithelial compartment delays airspace maturation and
increases susceptibility to CS-induced lung injury in adult mice. Mir34a which targets cMet for downregulation
is increased in COPD lungs and in human epithelial cells exposed to CS. A large genetic study identified
genome-wide significant associations for reduced lung function near MET (the gene encoding cMet) and near
HGFAC, the major activator for HGF. Based on this compelling data, we offer the central hypothesis that
HGF/cMet signaling is critical to airspace protection and function in both the developing and adult lung and can
be harnessed to treat acquired emphysema. The specific hypotheses that we test are 1) maintenance or
augmentation of cMet expression or signaling can protect against CS-induced airspace injury via
preserved alveolar epithelial homeostasis and dynamics, 2) CS-induced miRNAs contribute to reduced
cMet expression in the injured airspace epithelium, and 3) integrative multiomics anchored on cMet
signaling in large informative cohorts will identify molecular signatures that contribute to COPD
susceptibility."
10857320,"Project Summary/Abstract
Preterm infants are at increased risk of health complications due to their under-developed organ systems at
birth, and human milk receipt is recognized as an important intervention to promote infant health. Recent
identification of cells in human milk which have similar characteristics to stem cells, as well as animal models
which show integration of these cells into nursling's organs, indicate an important function of milk cells which is
currently not understood. In the NICU, infants often receive human milk which has been refrigerated or frozen,
and then warmed and/or thawed prior to feeding. The impact of these typical handling practices on the cellular
components of milk that may provide an important mechanism of biologic protection in infant health has not
been investigated. This work will determine how the real-life storage and handling of human milk impacts infant
health and development, and is the first to evaluate protective mechanisms. There are currently two major
knowledge gaps in the fields of human milk and lactation and neonatal care surrounding bioactive cellular
components. The first is a lack of knowledge of how real-life storage and handling practices impact the
protective ability of milk's cellular components for infants. Without this knowledge, infants who may benefit from
milk with the most bioactivity (such as preterm infants) may not receive the properties of their mother's milk
which provide important protection. The second major opportunity is the lack of knowledge on the
mechanism(s) of protection in milk stem-like cells. Additionally, as research techniques advance our ability to
investigate milk components, there is a great need to look at milk components in a biological systems
perspective. The specific aims of the research project are to 1) examine how hospital storage practices
(refrigeration and freezing) impact the protective mechanisms of human milk cells through the use of a tissue
culture model of intestinal health, and 2) determine if milk cells are integrated as functioning cells specific to
vital organs impacted by preterm birth (brain, heart, lungs, intestine) using a cross-foster mouse model. Upon
completion of the specific aims of the K23 research strategy and training plans, the candidate will have
advanced theoretical knowledge and technical skills to conduct human milk research with the ability to apply a
biological systems approach to understand the complexity of the many components of milk which likely impact
the function of each. The proposal research aims are supported by research training, didactic coursework,
scientific meetings, and specific plans for dissemination and future growth. Ultimately, the short- and long-term
goals of this research are to 1) improve infant health by optimizing the delivery of the most bioactive human
milk components and 2) determine the mechanism(s) by which human milk cells protect infants and promotes
growth and development."

10827452,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a heterogeneous debilitating disorder
characterized by severe disabling fatigue, especially post-exertion, in the absence of alternative diagnosis. The
etiology of ME/CFS remains unknown and underexplored and is likely multifaceted. Given the prevalence of
muscle fatigue symptoms, the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle has received attention in ME/CFS studies.
Skeletal muscles of ME/CFS individuals do not exhibit overt changes in muscle fiber architecture, quality, or
type, though studies have identified altered muscle metabolism, peripheral vascular dysfunction, and local and
systemic inflammation as potential mediators of CE/MFS. This project will address the premise that skeletal
muscle dysfunction in ME/CFS arises from a multifaceted and heterogeneous dysregulation of myogenic,
vascular endothelial, and immune cell identities and interactions in skeletal muscles. Myogenic cells and resident
immune and vascular endothelial cells are in close proximity and have varied interactions through cell-cell
signaling pathways and coupled metabolic programs that are critical for muscle health and disease. Here, we
will collect a new cohort of ME/CFS and control skeletal muscle biopsies to investigate the interactions between
myogenic, endothelial, and muscle-resident immune cells using innovative single-cell technologies. First, we will
collect a new cohort of skeletal muscle biopsies and blood samples from ME/CFS patients (n = 40) and healthy
controls (n = 20), along with accompanying survey and physiological data (grip strength and orthostatic vascular
function). Building on our prior track record of generating a multi-donor scRNAseq atlas in human skeletal
muscle, we will analyze these new biopsies by single-nucleus paired RNA/ATAC-sequencing (snRNA/ATACseq)
and a novel method of spatial total RNA-sequencing (STRS). snRNA/ATACseq will reveal changes in cellular
identities and compositions, as well as alterations in metabolic and transcriptional programs through various
bioinformatic analyses. STRS will reveal changes in the spatial mapping of muscle cell types and their noncoding
(e.g., regulatory miRNA and lncRNA) RNA profiles. Together these data will be integrated to identify changes in
cell-cell communication (ligand-receptor) pathways involving myogenic, endothelial, and immune cells and their
spatial organization between control and ME/CFS muscles. Various metrics from these single-cell datasets will
be tested through association studies as possible biomarkers that may explain the heterogeneous manifestations
of ME/CFS in this patient cohort. Third, hypotheses related to signaling interactions driving endothelial
dysfunction in ME/CFS skeletal muscles will be evaluated using cell culture models involving skeletal muscle-
specific human endothelial cells exposed to plasma and monocytes isolated from ME/CFS or control samples.
Together, these aims may shed light on the cellular and molecular etiologies of ME/CFS in human skeletal
muscles."
10827459,"Project 2 Summary. Circulating Signals of ME/CFS
Individuals with ME/CFS experience a multitude of disabling symptoms such as fatigue, pain,
unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise
(PEM). PEM is the inability to increase physical or mental effort without symptom exacerbation
and it greatly limits the quality of life of ME/CFS patients. In this project, we will learn more
about the tissues and organs affected during and after exercise when ME/CFS patients are
experiencing PEM. We have conducted a study in which ME/CFS and healthy sedentary control
subjects have undergone two successive cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs). As well as
obtaining extensive clinical and exercise physiology data, we have collected blood samples from
these subjects at four time points: before exercise (baseline), immediately after the first CPET,
after a 24 hour recovery period, and immediately after the second CPET. We have already
measured thousands of metabolites and proteins in these samples and measured gene
expression in subpopulations of immune cells. In this project, using the same plasma samples
from the longitudinal exercise study, we will examine novel types of signals that circulate in
blood: Cell-free ribonucleic acid (RNA) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Cell-free RNA is
released into the blood from dying cells in circulation or from various tissues throughout the
body. EVs are membrane-enclosed bodies that travel through the blood from different tissues
and can deliver protein, RNA, and other signaling molecules. EVs provide information about
tissues such as the brain that could otherwise not be obtained without invasive biopsy. We will
determine which tissues released the cell-free RNA and the EVs into circulation. Learning about
how the content and origin of these signals changes in ME/CFS patients compared to controls
before and after exercise may reveal disruptions in pathways that lead to PEM and provide
clues about additional tissues involved in PEM. We will also quantify the protein and RNA cargo
inside EVs, which can inform us about the modulatory effect the EVs may have in recipient
cells. Recent work also implicates disruption of the tissue that lines the inside of blood vessels
(endothelium). We will culture endothelial cells with plasma and EVs from ME/CFS patients and
controls at baseline to learn if molecules causing endothelial dysfunction in ME/CFS originate
inside or outside EVs. The wealth of data we will have from the same subjects will be used to
look for biomarkers to develop a diagnostic test for ME/CFS. We will also integrate these
different types of data to see if we can define clinically relevant subsets of ME/CFS patients."
10827463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) remains a prevalent, serious and poorly
understood disease, impacting millions in the USA alone with problems in concentration, memory and sleep
together with musculoskeletal pain. Thus, there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of the basic
science of this disease – as an integral step towards an ultimate cure. Despite our lack of understanding of
ME/CFS, substantial evidence implicates immune dysregulation either as an underlying cause or major
consequence of the disease. Our work has sought to systematically examine gene regulation across the
immune system, with the goal of determining which components are dysregulated in ME/CFS. These studies
have identified classical monocytes, platelets and certain subsets of T cells as the components of the immune
system most severely impacted by ME/CFS. These results establish that immune dysregulation in ME/CFS
involves disparate components of the immune system. Project 3 of our ME/CFS Center has three major goals.
First, to use multiomic approaches to rigorously determine the gene regulatory changes in monocytes in
ME/CFS. To complement these approaches, we will perform monocyte assays to test whether ME/CFS results
in alterations in the ability of monocytes to migrate and differentiate into macrophages, a critical function of
monocytes. Second, we will examine platelet dysregulation in ME/CFS, as our data identifies platelets as
amongst the most dysregulated component of the immune system in ME/CFS, with dysregulation particularly
evident in patients undergoing post-exertional malaise. We hypothesize that platelet defects could contribute to
circulatory and other symptoms in ME/CFS. In this Aim, we will examine the platelet transcriptome, perform
assays to test platelet function, and examine interactions between platelets and other immune cells in
ME/CFS. Third, we will systematically identify ME/CFS specific alterations in signaling across the immune
system. This goal is important, as identification of molecular changes that impact the immune system broadly
are attractive targets for future development of therapies. Achieving these goals has the potential to improve
diagnosis, including generating biomarkers, and will identify specific dysregulated pathways in ME/CFS,
providing a foundation for future development of therapeutics. For example, our first two goals have the
potential to reveal consequential alterations in either (or both) monocytes and platelets in ME/CFS, thereby
establishing a rational path towards eventual treatments or a cure. Because the patient and control cohorts
examined are common across this Center application, we will generate synergistic data from the constituent
projects. In particular, our genomic and functional assays examining monocytes will be paired with profiling of
macrophages in muscle (Project I), which are derived from monocytes in circulation. Similarly, Project II will
examine alterations to the platelet-derived extracellular vesicle proteome in ME/CFS, complementing our
analysis of platelets. Our comprehensive data will be a key resource for all researchers in the field."

This training grant is designed to address four critical threats to the field of Communication Sciences and
Disorders (CSD): (1) a national shortage of PhD level researchers; (2) increased need for translational,
interdisciplinary, and cross-methodological training; (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific advances to
educational, healthcare, and community settings; and (4) lack of equity and inclusion in the profession
including in research protocols and implementation of services to under-served communities. This proposal
requests support for four predoctoral students to participant in a translational and interdisciplinary training
program that draws on faculty from the departments of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Psychology
and Human Development, Otolaryngology, Biostatistics, and Medicine and leverages the resources and
training opportunities available at Vanderbilt (e.g., Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research,
The Implementation Science Core, The Office of Health Equity). Vanderbilt is uniquely positioned for the
proposed research as it is a recognized leader the fields of CSD, translational and implementation research,
and health equity. The purpose of this training grant is to prepare students for independent scholarship in
translational and interdisciplinary research. Trainees take formal coursework across different disciplines,
including instruction in quantitative methods, gain hands on experience with multiple methodologies, complete
a collaborative-interdisciplinary research rotation (spanning two or more approaches), in addition to working in
the lab of their primary advisor. Trainees have access to a number of research programs including in auditory
neuroscience, pediatric audiology, cochlear implants, language development and disorders, language
neuroscience and rehabilitation, psycholinguistics, developmental disorders and disability, cognitive-
communication disorders, community health, genetics, reading and reading disorders, acquired brain injury,
hearing and hearing aids, motor speech, voice, and fluency. Experimental methodologies include animal
models (e.g., monkey, mice, rabbit), neuroimaging (e.g., MRI/fMRI, DTI, fNIRS, EEG/ERP), physiological
measurement (e.g., heart rate, respiration, skin conductance), computational modeling, eye-tracking,
neuropsychology, lesion method, various behavioral paradigms, electromagnetic articulography, and advanced
statistical approaches. Students participate in expanded training in responsible conduct of research, replication
and reproducibility, scientific communication and grant writing, journal clubs, and research colloquia. Key
outcomes include submission of peer-reviewed manuscripts, application for external research funding (e.g.,
NIH NRSA F31), participation in national or international meetings, and eventually, employment at a research
university. The overarching goal of the training program is to prepare a number of highly trained and qualified
researchers who are well-equipped to address the challenges facing the field of CSD."
10828780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to continue our Training Program in Surgical Innovation (TPSI) to provide pre-doctoral engineering
students the knowledge, skills and experience necessary for becoming leaders in surgical innovation. During
the current funding period, we established a pipeline of quality applicants, implemented an effective review and
selection process, developed new courses, and trained 10 predoctoral students (2 of whom are new trainees).
Program evaluations (performed independently by Dartmouth’s Center for Program Design and Evaluation,
CPDE) found our innovation curriculum was praised, mentor-mentee relationships were strong, and merging of
training in biomedical engineering, surgical translation and innovation & entrepreneurship was valued highly by
trainees and mentors, alike. Outcomes to date are also strong: graduates hold industry positions in innovative
biomedical technology companies (two in medical start-ups), patents were filed and papers published in peer-
reviewed journals. Current trainees are also exceling: 2 were selected among 6 finalists (from more 50+ appli-
cants as far away as Canada) in a regional pitch competition; two are interning at biomedical start-ups. TPSI
links the Thayer School of Engineering (TSE) PhD Innovation Program (PhD-I) with a state-of-the-art NIH-
sponsored surgical research facility, the Center for Surgical Innovation (CSI). PhD-I provides trainees with na-
tional recognition, a well-developed curriculum, experienced faculty, approved advanced degree requirements
and a proven track record of success. CSI provides trainees access to experienced clinician-scientists and
state-of-the-art operating rooms equipped with advanced intraoperative imaging, designed for human and ani-
mal use. The funding request will cover tuition and stipends for 6 pre-doctoral positions per year. We will retain
TPSI’s administrative structure of three Program Directors (now Multi-PIs) with expertise in Biomedical Engi-
neering, Surgical Translation, and Innovation & Entrepreneurship, respectively. Participating mentors will con-
tinue to be organized similarly into Biomedical Engineering (BE), Surgical Translation (ST) and Innovation &
Entrepreneurship (IE) groups, and each trainee is assigned to a trio for guidance through the program. Train-
ees satisfy all of the elements of PhD-I – technical proficiency, technical breadth, specialization, professional
competence, original research and innovation skills development – tailored to the surgical setting, including
specialized courses in surgical innovation and commercialization. Methods for trainee recruitment and reten-
tion, diversity enhancement, program evaluation, instruction in responsible conduct of research and methods
for enhancing reproducibility are in place, and will continue to be monitored by CPDE."

leverage FIU's extensive expertise in student success, diversity, equity, and inclusion and focus on
programming that transforms students' access to biomedical research experiences and career awareness
and preparation. EMBRACE aims to 1) support the development of essential biomedical career skills to
ensure students are prepared to pursue future biomedical research paths; 2) increase student access to
authentic research experiences to promote development of essential research skills; 3) provide leadership
opportunities for undergraduate students, and 4) create an informed, proactive institutional community that
collectively supports STEM students in biomedical career exploration and development. EMBRACE will
offer a novel research and career development experience sequence to increase access to research
opportunities, starting with a 1-week research exploration, continuing with increasingly immersive
experiences in a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) and follow-up novel Course-
based Undergraduate Research Internship Experience (CURIE), and culminating in research leadership
opportunities as undergraduate research peer mentors. Students will receive career professional
development to promote essential professional skills, awareness of biomedical research career paths, and
create opportunities for students to network with faculty, alumni, and scientists. The research curriculum
will focus on investigating infectious diseases through the lens of bioinformatics, considering the
importance to improve bioinformatics skills among the biomedical workforce and the possibility of providing
access to safely conduct infectious pathogen cutting-edge research. Additionally, the project will provide
faculty professional development to faculty teaching across the biology degree program to become
effective mentors in their large-enrollment classrooms and provide students with guidance and strategies
to support their readiness for potential biomedical careers. The integrated research and career support
activities, organized longitudinally through the biology degree program, will support a diverse group of
undergraduate students to pursue advanced studies and join the biomedical research workforce."

10840312,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Recent therapeutic drug trials in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have failed to improve cognitive outcomes
despite improvements on imaging-based targets (e.g., amyloid PET). One possible missing link is a failure to
restore normal neuronal function. Measures of cortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation with
electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) have the potential to fill this gap by measuring the neuronal response to
controlled perturbation. However, practical applications of TMS-EEG measures are currently limited by a
dearth of data from brain regions involved in early-stage AD pathophysiology, and a lack of understanding of
how cortical excitability is related to clinically useful metrics. The long-term goal of this project is to determine
the extent to which cortical excitability is an important prognostic marker and/or treatment target in AD. This
study assesses excitability in both motor cortex—a well-characterized TMS site—and parietal cortex—a brain
involved in the early stages of AD pathogenesis. The objective of the present proposal is to understand how
parietal cortical excitability is related to neuroimaging abnormalities and prognosis in a cohort of early-stage
symptomatic AD participants (early AD). The hypothesis is that increased cortical excitability in parietal cortex
is related to neurodegeneration, decreased network connectivity, and more rapid clinical decline. This will be
tested with three independent Aims to assess how cortical excitability is related to 1) local cortical thickness, 2)
resting state fMRI connectivity; and 3) disease progression. The proposed project is highly innovative, using
TMS-EEG measures to capture local cortical excitability in AD, integrating neuroimaging and neurophysiologic
measurements, and testing the extent to which cortical excitability predicts meaningful clinical outcomes. This
contribution will be significant because it will inform our understanding of how measures of synaptic function
are related to progression of AD pathology. Findings from this study will lay the groundwork for future clinical
trials in AD seeking to measure restoration of neuronal function using novel biomarkers.
 The candidate has a strong commitment to a clinical research career in Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias. She is a practicing cognitive neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and
Instructor in Neurology at Harvard Medical School. Her training plan and research project are specifically
designed to build her expertise in AD biomarkers, advanced neuroimaging techniques, and biostatistics for AD
clinical trials. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Daniel Press and Dr. Michael Fox, will provide critical guidance
on the integration of TMS measures with neuroimaging. Additional mentorship will be provided by Dr. Mouhsin
Shafi on TMS-EEG, Dr. Reisa Sperling on AD biomarkers, and Dr. Long Ngo on biostatistics. Completion of
this five-year career development plan will allow the candidate to launch a career as an independent

10839928,"Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (290-320 nm) causes immune suppression, in addition to inducing mutant
cells. Tumors will occur only when there are mutant cells in an immune suppressive environment. Organ
transplant recipients who are treated with immunosuppressive medications have a greatly increased risk (up to 100
times) of UV induced skin cancers and the tumors that do develop behave more aggressively. In the United States,
the incidence of skin cancer has doubled from 1992 to 2012. Over 3.5 million new cases are diagnosed each year.
The epidemic of skin cancer represents a major public health issue and is a tremendous cost to healthcare systems
in the United States and worldwide. It is highly desired to understand the pathogenesis of UVB induced immune
suppression and develop new strategies for prevention and treatment. Our preliminary data show that UVB
increases Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (Trem)-1 in mouse and human skin tissues and by a
portion of CD11b+ cells from the mouse skin and draining lymph nodes. Importantly, we have, for the first time
demonstrated that blocking Trem1 with an antagonist peptide inhibits UVB induced immune suppression.
Moreover, blocking Trem1 inhibits UVB induced cutaneous carcinogenesis. The findings reveal a previously
unrecognized role of Trem1 in UVB induced immune suppression and skin carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a
common concept is that UVB induced tolerogenic antigen presenting cells (APC) are required for the induction of
immune suppression. Although strong evidence in human and animal studies indicates that CD11b+ cells contain
tolerogenic APC, CD11b+ cells are heterogeneous and specific tolerogenic APC remain to be identified. Our data
show that UVB induces Trem1 expression by a novel subset of conventional dendritic cell type 2 (cDC2) cells
(CD11b+). The UVB induced Trem1+ cDC2 cells in the draining lymph nodes express high levels of immune
inhibitory molecules CD200 and PD-L1 and are hardly detectable in normal mice. These findings define novel
Trem1+ cDC2 cells and implicate novel mechanisms for Trem1 mediated immune suppression. It forms a strong
premise for our hypothesis that UVB induced Trem1+ cDC2 are tolerogenic APC responsible for UVB induced
immune suppression and skin carcinogenesis. Targeting Trem1+ cDC2 cells has translational potentials for the
prevention and treatment of UVB induced carcinogenesis. Based on the novel findings, proposed studies will examine
the hypothesis in animals and humans. Aim 1 will identify UVB induced Trem1+ cDC2 cells as specific tolerogenic
APC and determine mechanisms for their immune suppressive activity. Aim 2 will determine mechanisms for the
development of UVB induced Trem1+ cDC2 cells. Aim 3 will determine UVB induced Trem1+ cDC2 cells in human
skin and blood and determine their roles in immune suppression. Collectively, the current application will apply
advanced technology and use genetic and pharmacological approaches to fully characterize the Trem1+ cDC2 cells
and explore new mechanisms for UVB induced immune suppression. The outcome will have impacts in the
research field and may be exploited to new strategies for prevention and treatment of skin cancers."

 The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in mammalian DNA is drawing significant attention in epigenetics
because of its indispensable roles in gene expression regulation. The loss of 5hmCs in various cancers
including glioblastomas and lymphomas has been linked to the poor survival rate as well as the resistance to
anti-cancer therapeutics. Although there is amassing evidence of 5hmCs as a novel epigenetic marker, there is
very little understanding on how 5hmCs are enriched at specific loci in the genome. In this project, we aim to
identify the factors controlling the DNA demethylation pathway, which result in the formation of locus-specific
5hmCs in human neurons. For this purpose, proteins controlling the activity of ten-eleven translocase (TET)
family enzymes in the DNA demethylation pathway will be identified. To examine the function of candidate
proteins, we will take advantage of human induced-neurons (hiNs) derived from human induced-pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSCs). In addition, we will elucidate the role and fate of 5hmCs formed during DNA damage
repair process using blue light-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 technique. This robust experimental platform will
enable the rapid production of isogenic and homogenous neurons and other cell types. With this cell-based
assay system, high-throughput assays can be developed that will advance biomedical researches and drug
discoveries. Finally, we expect the successful completion of this project will expand our understanding on DNA
demethylation and their roles in epigenetics, development, and various human diseases."

(cART) while HIV latency, and cell-specific expression of HIV transcript in human CNS remains
incompletely understood. There is high prevalence of HIV-associated neurologic disease and increasing
recognition of CNS viral escape in people stably suppressed with cART, often further complicated by
the co-registered epidemic of substance use disorders (SUD) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA),
as SUD also have profound impact on CNS function. Ongoing work in our laboratory is providing first
assessments of cell-type specific HIV 'molecular signatures', including genome integration patterns and
alterations on the level of the transcriptome and epigenome in reward- and addiction circuitry of the
human postmortem brain. As described in detail in the Preliminary Data section, we found dramatically
high levels of HIV expression in a subset of microglia from postmortem specimens, with HIV transcript
levels ranking among the top 5 highest expressed RNAs in microglia, or the 99.9% percentile of all
microglial transcript. Correspondingly, HIV genome integration sites in addiction circuitry are dominated
by microglia-specific genes, with strong preference for active chromatin compartments. However,
lingering effects of latent infection that persist during cART have not been well characterized—in part
because of fundamental challenges in identifying the extent to which microglial cells contribute to the
latent reservoir. Our preliminary studies also provide a model system whereby we can track and isolate
persistently infected cells which can be applied to the microglial compartment and will allow us to define
the genomic perturbations that persist during cART. By studying HIV genomics in human microglia
residing in the mouse brain and linking this with technology to track persistently infected microglia, we will
be able to model, for the first time, experimental therapies and interventions to complement our
descriptive work in human postmortem brain. Specifically, our Cre-reporter based HIV-induced lineage
tracing (HILT) marking system will allow us to quantify and isolate the rare latently infected microglia that
persist during cART, and map transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations separately both for infected, and
non-infected microglia, both collected from the same mouse brain. With focus on addition circuitry, we will
study neuroinflammation, cognition and reward behavior in mice treated with standard cART regimens
and an experimental therapy involving Cannabinoid receptor 2 agonist drugs that, according to our
preliminary data, are linked to anti-inflammatory activity limiting the extent of HIV infection in tissues."
10849638,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome-wide molecular profiling of dynamic DNA and chromatin modifications across diverse cell and disease
states have resulted in comprehensive catalogs of putative non-coding regulatory elements in the human
genome. Perturbation experiments are now critical to learn the causal functions of the DNA & histone
modifications at these genomic elements. However, existing tools to manipulate gene expression and chromatin
state suffer from partial or transient effects, are large and thus difficult to deliver, and exhibit high variability
across loci and cell types. These tools are currently drawn from a tiny fraction of the thousands of natural
chromatin regulatory complexes. A more complete toolbox of compact, efficient domains capable of
manipulating a broad range of chromatin pathways will transform our ability to determine the causal
function of particular chromatin modifications across the human genome and to control gene
expression.
 Here, we propose to systematically and comprehensively measure the gene expression effects of
recruiting chromatin regulators and transcription factor protein domains that can interface with human chromatin
- a critical missing dataset. This is made possible by our recent development of the first high-throughput protein
domain recruitment assay in human cells, capable of measuring activity for tens of thousands of effector domains
simultaneously (Tycko et al, bioRxiv 2020). Using this system, we will recruit-and-release effector domains from
the promoter, wait, and then measure the magnitude and permanence of transcriptional silencing or activation
at a reporter locus. We will characterize thousands of domains drawn from human and viral chromatin and gene
regulators. In addition, we will create orthogonal nanobody libraries selected to recruit endogenous chromatin
regulators. We will then measure the function of these domains at a panel of endogenous genomic loci chosen
to represent diverse chromatin states. Finally, we will use genetic screens and epigenomic mapping assays to
determine the molecular networks that underpin the functions of these novel effectors. Therefore, we will create
and share a detailed resource of experimentally-measured, compact, efficient domains that can be fused onto
DNA-binding proteins in order to recruit desired chromatin regulatory complexes to act upon a genomic element.
At the same time, this study will provide detailed functional properties for all human transcriptional and chromatin
regulatory domains, serving as a starting point for future work on understanding the disease implications of
genetic mutations in the coding sequence of these regulators. Further, it will identify novel epigenome and
transcriptional effector domains that can impart permanent epigenetic memory, and identify combinations of
domains to impart a range of chromatin states not currently accessible with available perturbation tools. These
pathway-specific perturbation technologies will be critical to probe the function of the varied chromatin states at
regulatory elements that are currently being discovered and studied across diverse genomic loci and cell types."

Neurofibromatosis (NF) encompasses a set of complex genetic disorders that affect almost every organ system
and increase risk for the development of benign and malignant central and peripheral nervous system tumors. Of
the three types of NF, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is the most prevalent occurring in approximately 1 in
every 3,000 births without predilection for race, sex, or ethnicity. While NF1 is inherited in a fully penetrant
autosomal dominant manner, there is wide inter-individual variability with respect to clinical features and their
impact on patient morbidity. Clinical heterogeneity is a pervasive challenge for clinicians and families, as
the management of children and adults with NF1 remains largely reactive, without reliable biomarkers
or predictive models for early risk stratification and/or prognostic assessment at the time of diagnosis.
Traditional approaches, which focus on identifying a single clinical or biological marker that can be measured
and used to assess disease risk or trajectory in NF1, have achieved limited success and have hindered progress
in the development of precision medicine for NF1-affected individuals. In response to these challenges, and with
the opportunity to improve the care of individuals with NF1, we aim to verify and validate an alternative and
generalizable approach for developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support tools for NF1
sub-phenotypes, implemented and evaluated in a comparative manner across two clinical sites.
Our proposed project will first generate a multi-scale data set using a text-mining based clinical phenotyping
algorithm to integrate and harmonize data from multiple sources such as clinical databases, structured
electronic health records, and unstructured clinical notes. Secondly, we will develop AI-based pipelines
capable of generating predictive models and tools to identify disease risk for three critical NF1 sub-
phenotypes (OPGs, scoliosis, and ADHD). We will then evaluate the models for quantitative accuracy and
clinical actionability at the point of care with the help of NF1 clinicians. Finally, we will validate these methods
and models across multiple sites, so that we can better understand the challenges to generalizing and
transporting such predictive models based across different healthcare systems, environments, and populations.
We anticipate that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in order to study NF1-specific sub-phenotypes at
two different sites will yield novel and potentially clinically-actionable and generalizable insights concerning the
precision diagnosis and care of individuals with NF1, with broader applicability across a spectrum of similarly
complex disease-states."

With its revised title “Emergent Properties of Complex Systems: From Atoms to Macromolecules; from
Humans to Societies” this proposal has been broadened by adding data-analysis & simulation on a problem
of grave current concern: namely how an air-borne virus like SARS-2-CoV spread in human population.
Getting involved by accident, I became fascinated with how the numbers of daily cases & deaths group with
time and what is the physical mechanism that make the data follow the Gompertz function.
Michael Levitt, the Principal Investigator has a long career of independent scientific research that started in
1967 when he was one of the first to work in computational biology. His early work set up the conceptual,
theoretical and computational framework for protein and DNA structure refinement, structure analysis and
macromolecular simulations. He makes computer codes available and has been productive, scientifically
rigorous and impactful for half a century. This approaches is continued here by a PI committed to mentoring
young scientists as well as engaging in sustained research-community service and public outreach.
1. Protein Structure Refinement with Deep Equivariant Networks. We propose to use Deep Learning
 technique to refine models of proteins. We anticipate that such an approach, combined with the power of
 modern neural net architectures and computational performance of hardware will enable efficient sampling
 of the protein conformational space near the native state and will systematically provide structures with
 accuracy useful for drug development purposes.
2. Functional Dynamics of Ribosome. Our experience with structure curation will lead to a useful computer
 package for others. Our work on Ribosome dynamics will provide a model of how peptides such as SecM
 can stall the ribosome. Structures sampled from our MD simulations could also be used as potential
 targets for drug discovery.
3. Epidemic Analysis, Curve-Fitting and Simulation. Applied to SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19, we show
 that viral spread follows the Gompertz growth function rather than commonly assumed Logistics or
 Exponential functions. This means that the population transmitting the infection is not uniform. Network
 simulation of viral spread shows that only when the connection network is scale-free does the simulated
 epidemic follow the Gompertz function. We will model a physical system with scale-free connectivity using
 molecular dynamics to simulate a 2D gas of particles with a wide range of masses. This novel multi-
 disciplinary approach may also apply to future respiratory viruses to enable better control of their spread.
Studying biomedically significant systems in collaboration with experimental colleagues will reveal fascinating
details of biology in action. We expect this work will help elucidate the relationship between underlying
structure and function in complex systems, extending from macromolecular machines to human societies."

 We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a direct 3D mobile imaging based foot orthotics
optimization system for clinicians to treat and prevent chronic conditions such as diabetic ulceration and
malalignment. The proposed system leaps beyond the traditional orthotics production process, as it
allows clinicians to directly and conveniently acquire patients' 3D foot structure from any needed
postures (either weight bearing, non-bearing, or partial weight bearing), provides comprehensive details
on patients' foot biomechanics, and optimizes orthotics design through finite element analysis. The
proposed system also allows localized testing and refitting through a 3D printer, facilitating comfort
orthotics design and thus improving the compliance issue faced today.
 The proposed solution will have the following impact and significance: facilitate effective
prevention of the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers; better foot orthotics customization experience; more
comfort fit leading to better compliance; and lower treatment cost.
 Diabetic foot complications are common and costly problem. Approximately 30.3 million
Americans, 9.4 percent of the U.S. population have diabetes, according to the American Academy of
Orthotists and Prosthetists. In adults over age 60, about 1 in 4 have diabetes. With the aging population,
this group is expected to grow at least 7% per year for the next 10 years. Custom foot orthotics are
commonly used to treat and prevent the recurrence of foot diabetics. Undoubtedly, the development of a
low cost and ubiquitous mobile platform based foot orthotics optimization and rapid prototyping method
will have significant impact on the elderlies especially for the low and middle income sufferers."
10841707,"Pancreatic islets rely on spatiotemporally orchestrated interactions between heterogenous cells to maintain
blood glucose homeostasis. In type 1 diabetes, an islet-directed autoimmune attack leads to loss of functional β
cells, which is accompanied by defects in the other islet cell types. Diabetics suffer complications from chronic
glucose misregulation, which ultimately reduce life expectancy. Administering insulin itself can treat type 1
diabetes. However, daily insulin injection is expensive, onerous, and carries side effects including risk of
ketoacidosis and coma. Human stem cell-derived islet organoids (SC-islets) offer a chance to generate a limitless
human islet supply as potential therapeutics through transplantation. However, SC-islets lack the precision,
kinetics, and magnitude of insulin/glucagon secretion that natural islets show during adult life. Whether these
limitations reflect poor spatiotemporal coordination between (or within) populations of SC-islet cell types, or
intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneity in development and maturation, is still unknown.
Here, we propose to address these fundamental questions by experimentally capturing the trajectories of cellular
activity and interaction across the 3D volume of developing SC-islets through the integration of novel
technologies from stem cell biology, soft thin-film nanoelectronics, tissue clearing and single-cell spatial
transcriptomics, and computational and system biology. Specifically, we have (1) exploited scalable cell
differentiation and purification methods to build “designer” SC-islets with custom α and β composition; (2) globally
embedded soft stretchable sensor arrays within SC-islets, building “cyborg islets” for chronically-stable tracing
of islet-wide α- and β-cell type specific electrical activities at single-cell resolution in vitro and in vivo; (3)
implemented 3D tissue clearing, staining, imaging, and in situ single-cell RNA sequencing to spatially map
hormones, biomarkers, gene expression, and cell types in the intact SC-islets at subcellular resolution; and (4)
used fluorescently-labeled electronic barcodes to identify sensor positions within cleared SC-islets and
computationally integrate chronic electrical recording with hormones, biomarker and gene expression data at the
single-cell level.
We propose to integrate and use these inventions to address major challenges in SC-islet maturation.
Specifically, we aim to employ such multimodal characterization of SC-islet development to address (1) the role
of Dec1 in islet maturation mediated by circadian entrainment; (2) the 3D heterogeneity in SC-islet maturation;
and (3) the role of nerve innervation and vascularization in the maturation of transplanted SC-islets. The success
of this proposal will result in a platform that can monitor the in situ single-cell activity of SC-islets in a chronically
stable manner, provide an understanding of the 3D heterogeneity during SC-islet development and maturation.
We envision that it will ultimately enable us to build functionally specialized and mature SC-islets for human
therapeutics."
10845496,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Speech deficits are among the most prevalent and impairing of symptoms for people with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD). In fact, 25% of people with ASD have little to no speech. The reasons many people with ASD
struggle to speak are still poorly understood, which means that our treatments don't target the source of the
problem. Our preliminary work has demonstrated that altering auditory feedback can influence speech in
individuals with ASD. However, the ability to translate these findings to the development of novel treatments for
speech deficits in ASD is impeded by our limited understanding of how auditory feedback interacts with speech
motor control in individuals with ASD. In the proposed study, we will use behavioral tasks and multiple methods
of advanced brain imaging to understand how brain chemicals and brain function impact a child's ability to speak
in order to identify the specific barriers to speech production for people with ASD.
Specifically, we will first characterize psychophysical and neural markers of speech motor control in children and
adolescents with and without ASD (Aim 1). We will then identify the mechanisms of speech motor control that
are associated with clinical symptoms of speech impairment (Aim 2). Using magnetoencephalography, functional
MRI and MR spectroscopy, we will then examine the relations between clinical speech abilities and brain
metabolites and connectivity in the speech motor network (Aim 3). The results of the project will not only help
explain why some people with ASD struggle to speak but will also open doors for development of targeted
treatments to address the source of the problem for the first time, which could dramatically extend the impact of
current speech therapies and even fundamentally change the prognosis for minimally verbal children with autism."

 This is an application for a Support of Research Enhancement (SuRE) R16 award. These grants are
intended to support small scale research projects at institutions like Northern Kentucky University that do not
receive substantial NIH funding, with an additional emphasis on providing biomedical research experiences to
students from groups traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and health science and enhancing the
research environment at the university.
 Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) are widely used in children mainly as off-label treatments for a multitude of
pediatric psychiatric disorders, despite the lack of basic research documenting their effects on later brain and
behavioral function. One concern is that APD exposure during early brain development alters later sensitivity to
drugs of abuse. Our previous NIH-funded research showed that adult rats administered the APD, risperidone,
early in life are hyperactive, exhibit enhanced locomotor and rewarding responses to the psychostimulant, D-
amphetamine, and display alterations in forebrain dopamine transporters and receptors. These data were
generated by undergraduate students at NKU, many of whom served as first- or co- authors on published
papers, and some of whom went on to pursue graduate study in psychology.
 Having ascertained that early-life risperidone modifies responses to psychostimulant drugs that directly
target dopamine synapses, we now seek to determine if behavioral and neural sensitivity to other classes of
drugs, such as opioids, that indirectly work though dopamine pathways is enhanced by early-life risperidone.
The proposed work will ascertain whether behavioral, neural, and genetic responses to the opioid drug,
oxycodone, are altered in adult rats administered risperidone early in life (daily injections from postnatal day
14-42). This issue is especially germane to NKU students since our geographic area is marked by relatively
high rates of opioid use and overdose. Overall, the proposed research will address the following questions: 1)
Does early-life APD administration enhance the rewarding effects of oxycodone during adulthood?, 2)
Does early-life APD administration increase neural sensitivity to oxycodone in the forebrain during
adulthood? and 3) Does early-life APD administration modify patterns of forebrain gene transcription
induced by oxycodone during adulthood? The last aim will be achieved by collaborating with the nearby
University of Louisville to quantify mRNA expression in tissue samples using next-generation RNA-Seq
technology. A concomitant goal of this work will be to continue engaging NKU undergraduate students in the
execution, analysis, and reporting of research. The proposed work will take advantage of training and
pedagogical resources offered by NKU and the KY-INBRE program to enhance these experiences and, in turn,
contribute to the overall research environment at NKU."

In the last 30 years, clinical outcomes for individuals with rotator cuff tears have not substantially improved, which
is problematic for the 4.5 million Americans that seek medical care for rotator cuff tears each year. Our long-term
goal is to maximize functional recovery following rotator cuff tears by identifying patients most likely to benefit
from targeted pain interventions. This knowledge is necessary to optimize treatments of impaired pain
processing. Our central hypothesis is that the nervous system plays a larger role in symptom severity and
recovery than conventionally believed. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the disconnect between the
rotator cuff structural damage and pain severity and the poor relationship between the extent of structural
damage (i.e., tear size, retraction, etc.) and functional recovery. Dr. Pozzi, a physical therapist with expertise in
biomechanics and movement science, will take his research in a new direction by approaching rotator cuff tears
from pain and neuroscience perspectives. Dr. Pozzi assembled a team with extensive clinical, pain,
neuroimaging, and pain-neuroscience expertise to test his central hypothesis through three specific aims: 1) test
the association between brain function during a shoulder motor-task, chronicity of injury, and clinical pain
symptoms in individuals with rotator cuff tears; 2) test the relationship between pain phenotypes, chronicity of
injury, and clinical pain symptoms in individuals with rotator cuff tears; and 3) test the utility of baseline
dispositional traits, quantitative sensory testing, and brain function to predict recovery following rotator cuff repair.
This application is innovative because we will recruit the three injury etiologies of rotator cuff tears (traumatic-
symptomatic, chronic-symptomatic, and asymptomatic), which provide a key advantage in studying chronic pain.
We are uniquely positioned to shed light on how the nervous system reacts to sudden and chronic loss of tendon
structural integrity with and without pain symptoms. We have the potential to test specific central features of
acute rotator cuff-induced pain that may become chronic. We designed a novel experiment in which we will
acquire functional brain images during precisely controlled submaximal isometric shoulder contractions. We will
elucidate factors influencing movement-evoked pain of body areas associated with the primary clinical
symptoms, thus providing evidence of potential intervention targets. Our study will provide a significant
contribution by identifying additional factors that may influence the variability in patient outcomes. Further, our
findings will move us toward the long-term goals of this line of investigation: informing precision pain medicine
with consideration for specific pain phenotypes in individuals with rotator cuff tears. The knowledge gained in
this study will not be incremental; it will springboard a paradigm shift in treating patients with rotator cuff tears."

Signaling by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family ligands through EGFR/ErbB receptors controls
myriad developmental and behavioral processes across metazoa and its dysregulation contributes to
human diseases such as cancer and schizophrenia. Our understanding of EGF signaling is founded in
studies of the nematode C. elegans, which for decades has served as a model for the function of a
single ligand–receptor pair, encoded by lin-3/EGF and let-23/EGFR. The central role for EGF signaling
in C. elegans vulval organogenesis, along with the powerful molecular-genetic tools available in this
model system, has revealed foundational concepts in signal transduction. In recent years an EGFR-
dependent sleep state triggered by various forms of cellular damage has been identified in C. elegans.
This stress-induced sleep (SIS) has since been observed in Drosophila and zebrafish, and may
represent a core constituent of sleep drive. Consistent with this notion, EGF family ligands have been
found to have sleep-promoting activity across species including mammals. However, the mechanism
by which cellular damage leads to EGFR activation within sleep-promoting neurons is not known. As
LIN-3 is the only recognized EGFR ligand in C. elegans, the requirement for LIN-3 in SIS has been
largely assumed rather than carefully examined. Further, attempts to identify a protease that releases
the soluble EGF domain from its membrane-bound proprotein in response to cellular stress have been
unsuccessful. Based on considerable student-gathered data, including findings from unbiased genetic
screens for sleepless mutants, we hypothesize that C. elegans possesses an additional EGFR ligand
that is processed by a stress-responsive metalloprotease, ADM-4, to trigger sleep. We present a
rigorous molecular-genetic research plan involving students that aims to characterize this new EGF
family ligand and its sheddase. These studies are expected to demystify the initiation of stress-induced
sleep, with potential relevance across species, and establish a powerful genetic model for stress-
responsive EGFR activation with relevance to cancer."
10840821,"Abstract
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is an obstructive lung disease caused by a combination of inflammation
and immune response that is irreversible in its late stage. Children with BOS are typically diagnosed late
because they are unable to perform spirometry, and morbidity and mortality are high. The long-term goal of this
work is to improve survival and reduce morbidity from BOS by identifying strategies for accurate screening and
prediction of BOS in children and young adults after HSCT and using these tools to identify novel drug targets
for early intervention or prevention of BOS. The objective of this application is to validate novel predictive plasma
protein biomarkers and establish a dynamic prediction model for BOS for early diagnosis, risk stratification and
disease trajectory prediction for BOS after HSCT. We will achieve these goals through the following specific
aims: 1) Validate longitudinal predictive performance of newly discovered plasma biomarkers of BOS risk in
samples from banked and prospective studies by mass spectrometry and ELISA in both pediatric and adult
cohorts. 2) Optimize and validate our dynamic prediction algorithm using pulmonary function and clinical data as
well as biomarker levels (needed when no spirometry can be obtained) as covariates to project risks of BOS and
rapid BOS lung-function decline to inform treatment decisions. There are currently no biomarkers or predictive
tools for BOS so this work is entirely novel. The use of a dynamic prediction algorithm in this clinical setting is
innovative allowing for the first time the ability to predict and diagnose early lung disease in HSCT subjects prior
to the clinical diagnosis of BOS. Identification of BOS risk and stratification of screening and treatment
procedures according to risk and predicted disease course would allow us to modify post-transplant care and
reduce morbidity and mortality. We will use our data to inform prospective clinical trials of both early active
treatment prior to development of early fibrosis and to test novel prophylactic therapies to reduce incidence in
high risk individuals. Our studies will provide blood biomarkers that can be used as frequently as necessary
without requiring active participation from small and often very sick children. Our preliminary biomarker and
HSCT specific algorithm data demonstrate detection of BOS as soon as 2 weeks to 6 months prior to clinical
diagnosis of BOS. This work is both significant and vital because improvements in HSCT techniques and
supportive care have led to improved survival. Improved survival increases the number of children at risk for late
complications of HSCT that are associated with life-changing morbidity and late mortality and there is urgent
need to address these issues. This work will advance prediction and early diagnosis of BOS, as well as providing
the framework for future prevention and treatment trials."
10848195,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transformation of the early embryo from a seemingly disorganized ball of stem cells to the complex and
precisely patterned adult form requires stereotyped regulation cell behaviors via biophysical and biochemical
cues. Using the chick embryo, the long term goals of my research program are to understand from a highly
quantitative perspective how this is orchestrated. Approximately half of the lab focuses on mechanobiology of
embryonic development, seeking to understand the forces that shape tissues and organs in the embryo and
the cues that specify those forces. The remainder of the lab studies cell fate determination, either in the context
of early brain development or in the developing gut. The present application stems from the latter.
During embryonic development, one of the first major steps in lineage segregation is gastrulation, when a
single totipotent layer of cells separates into three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. While
conventionally, it has long been accepted that all progenitors of each germ layer are generated only during
gastrulation, recent studies have challenged this, identifying a multipotent progenitor population that persists
after gastrulation ends in the tailbud. Within this population, known as neuromesodermal progenitors, a single
cell can give rise to progeny that contribute to both notochord (mesoderm) and neural tube (ectoderm). While
studying gut tube formation in the chick embryo, we recently identified a population of endoderm cells that line
the ventral surface of the tailbud, and appear to undergo a widespread and previously unreported epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT). These cells invade the neighboring tailbud tissue, reaching as far as the dorsal
surface of the tailbud. Importantly, cells can be seen dispersed throughout the region where neuromesodermal
progenitors are known to reside, as well as in the neural tube and notochord. This suggests that these
endodermal cells represent an unappreciated source of neuromesodermal progenitors, which, if they retain the
ability to generate endodermal tissues as well, would be remarkable. The present application combines
classical embryology approaches such as fate mapping and grafting experiments with gene misexpression and
single-cell RNA Sequencing in an effort to make sense of the simple yet puzzling observation that endoderm
cells undergo a localized EMT and invade the tailbud at a time when gastrulation is complete. The proposal
aims to identify the tissues to which this prospective progenitor population contributes, and to construct a
detailed single-cell transcriptomic atlas of this population, from which identity, regulatory circuits, and proposed
lineage trajectories can be inferred. At the completion of the proposed work, we will have established a new in
vivo model to study endodermal EMT, and potentially identified a novel stem cell population residing in the
endoderm, with the ability to give rise to mesodermal and ectodermal cells. This stands in contrast to long-held

Over 40% of lung allograft recipients succumb within five years of being transplanted, making it clear that there is an
urgent unmet need to address the inadequacies of chronic immunosuppression (IS) in these patients. Achieving a
robust state of tolerance in lung recipients would reduce or eliminate the major lung-specific and drug-related factors
that contribute to this dismal statistic. Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in nonhuman primates (NHPs)
and humans by using a combination of nonmyeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation that
results in transient mixed hematopoietic chimerism. However, identical protocols have failed to induce tolerance in
recipients of lung allografts. Despite the resistance of lung allografts to tolerance induction, we have now shown for
the first time, that achieving a state of durable (for the life of the organ) mixed chimerism in NHP recipients results in
long-term, IS-free survival of lung allografts. This remarkable result was achieved by modifying the mixed chimerism
conditioning to augment host regulatory mechanisms. While a significant advance, this modified mixed chimerism
protocol was only successful in recipients of MHC haplo-matched lung allografts and was associated with significant
toxicity in the form of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and
radiation-induced myelosuppression. Our goal now is to render this breakthrough clinically applicable by generating a
safer and more effective protocol that is capable of inducing long-term tolerance of unrelated, fully MHC mismatched
lung allografts using FDA-approved or soon-to-be-approved drugs. This Program’s unifying hypothesis is that inducing
durable chimerism and long-term tolerance in recipients of stringent lung allografts will require next-generation mixed
chimerism protocols that augment systemic and intra-graft adaptive and innate regulatory mechanisms. In Project 1,
we will test this hypothesis using intra-organ delivery of αIL-6R-specific and mTORi-specific nanotherapies to reduce
IS-related complications, block trained immunity, and promote intra-graft regulation. Bcl-2 inhibition will be used to
promote durable mixed chimerism while diminishing the toxicities related to total body irradiation (TBI)-driven
myelosuppression. These studies will be complemented by Project 2, which will test our unifying hypothesis using
novel strategies for antibody-based conditioning, regulatory T cells (Treg)-supportive immunomodulation, and gene-
modified Tregs, all poised for immediate clinical translation. State-of-the-art mechanistic assays coordinated by Core
A (The Molecular Immunology Core, ‘MIC’) will enable rapid cross-fertilization of insights gained in each project. We
anticipate that together, these highly interactive projects will generate one or more safe and effective durable mixed
chimerism tolerance protocols ready for clinical trials by the end of the funding period. If successful, these studies
could impact the entire field of transplantation and provide insights that could also be field-changing for bone marrow
transplantation and autoimmune disease."

We seek acceptance of our predoctoral biotechnology training program, which has a history of producing
accomplished leaders in academia and industry. Biotechnology is broadening and evolving as a field with an
expansion of knowledge, tools, and applications. In parallel, industry is shaping new efforts using
biotechnology for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Stanford provides an unusually rich
environment, with co-located, nationally ranked schools devoted to basic science, engineering, and medicine,
and a strong industrial presence from the surrounding Bay Area. We are leveraging this ecosystem to train
talented students who are becoming the next-generation of interdisciplinary global biotechnology innovators,
and who will lead and invent the future with integrity and rigor. We are seeking training funding for 10 trainees
per year for a period of 5 years. The program fuses 39 investigators from 9 departments across at the university
into a highly visible program that delivers a unique, applications-oriented training experience focused on
health-related biotechnology. Differentiating features of this program include curricular offerings in
biotechnology innovation and leadership, industrial internships, field trips, symposia, and deep interactions
among trainees and academic and industrial mentors."

The integrity of a cell depends on the quality of its components. These components include proteins, which are
responsible for executing most cellular functions, many through organization into stable complexes. A hallmark
of aged cells is the breakdown of protein integrity, or proteostasis, which results from the damage to key proteins
and complexes over time, leading to more accumulated damage, and ultimately cell dysfunction. The specific
proteome components that are most susceptible to damage and that drive its accumulation remain unclear, but
the survival of future generations depends on protection of one cell type—gametes—from inheriting damaged
components from their precursor cell. During gametogenesis in the simple budding yeast, as a precursor cell is
differentiated into gametes, we observe the degradation of many cellular structures and proteins, followed by
their resynthesis and reorganization. This cellular restructuring is associated with an active rejuvenation program
that allows equivalently young gametes to be produced from old or young precursor cells. The mechanisms that
contribute to this natural rejuvenation program are not known, but it can be recapitulated by exogenous
expression of a meiotic transcription factor in aged mitotic cells, suggesting that it is portable.
 Gametogenesis in yeast thus offers the opportunity to watch as the cell shows us what proteins and
complexes it needs to reset and reorganize to ensure cellular youth, and the mechanisms it uses to achieve this.
Of particular interest are proteins of basal or “housekeeping” function, including the ribosome, which are long-
lived in mitotic cells, but degraded and replaced at great energetic cost during gametogenesis. We also observe
reorganization of abundant housekeeping complexes, including the proteasome, during gametogenesis, and
aggregation of some proteins, including superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), at the time of their degradation.
Together, these observations suggest that yeast cells remodel their proteome during gametogenesis as a quality
control measure. Here, we propose to identify the key set of cellular components, with a focus on “housekeeping”
proteins, that are reset as gametes are created from precursor cells. We use a proteomic approach to globally
define changes to protein complexes during gamete construction, and specifically determine proteasome
remodeling and activity over time. We investigate the links between aggregation of proteins, including Sod1, and
protein oxidation and degradation. Finally, we identify the specific degradation mechanisms that drive key
aspects of proteome remodeling and test their necessity for gamete rejuvenation and ability to drive lifespan
extension when exogenously activated. This project will build an atlas to reveal the proteins and complexes that
are important enough for young cell identity to warrant the energetic cost of resetting them during gamete
formation, as well as those that may be toxic enough to warrant their active removal. By identifying and
manipulating the specific pathways used by gametes to selectively remodel their proteome, we will find strategies
that can be co-opted to combat and prevent age-associated cellular damage."

 The Shao group at Iowa State University aims to leverage their expertise in genetic tool development to
assemble a comprehensive mitochondrial genetic toolkit. The causative role of mitochondrial DNA is implicated
in a myriad of human diseases and disorders. However, human mitochondrial dysfunction studies suffer from
the absence of an ideal eukaryotic model. The well-studied model yeast, S. cerevisiae, is unsuitable due to its
mitochondrial physiology deviating too far from humans. We propose developing a new promising model to
heighten knowledge of human mtDNA, yielding new insights on mitochondrial dysfunction and pathogenicity.
We have identified that Yarrowia lipolytica strikes a perfect balance between practicality (i.e., low cost and
quick timescale of genetic manipulations as a low eukaryote) and tractability (i.e., mirroring human's obligate
aerobic needs). In addition, the overwhelming majority of current mitochondrial dysfunction studies focus solely
on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene abnormalities. This is mainly attributed to the fact that the explosive
progression of nuclear genome editing technology in the epoch of “post-CRISPR” has yet to translate to
mtDNA editing. We propose leveraging a recently discovered stem-loop RNA motif to overcome nucleic acid
import limitations – the largest technical barrier to the development of CRISPR-associated technologies. If this
strategy proves effective, we envision that many mtDNA manipulation tools will be developed by research labs
around the globe, following the same trajectory as the CRISPR nuclear genome manipulation revolution.
 Over the next five years, in addition to the foundational tool development, we will strive for elucidating
mtDNA-phenotype relationships in the new model. The ability of Y. lipolytica to accumulate lipids makes it a
particularly suitable model for human adipocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue is involved in a
broad spectrum of epidemics plaguing human health. Mediated by our development of a mitochondrial genetic
toolkit, we will reconstitute mtDNA-associated human pathologies in a precise manner, enabling tailored drug
development and all the subsequent mechanistic studies. Moreover, we propose studying the impact of
modulating the fluidity of the inner mitochondrial membrane on altering mitochondrial physiology, which will
lead to the discovery of potential treatments of obesity-related diseases in the future. Lastly, along a side
research branch, we will integrate the developed mitochondrial genetic toolkit with our previous efforts in
metabolic engineering. We will leverage the multiplicity of mitochondria in a single cell as well as the high copy
number of mtDNA in a single mitochondrion to boost the dosage of the gene encoding the rate-limiting step in
a biochemical pathway. This strategy will revolutionize the metabolic engineering design of eukaryotic hosts to
produce a wide variety of compounds derived from TCA cycle or whose biosynthetic mechanism requires a
high ATP input. Altogether, this MIRA for ESI project will enable me to move into research areas distinct from
my existing ones and grant me the flexibility to follow important new research directions as opportunities arise."

The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of
the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants
at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities.
For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term
outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and
predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long-
term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early
prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit
from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement
impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will
obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a
supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our
knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to
currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that
algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows
us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented
gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we
will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2:
To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from
single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm
without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data
from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to
classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development.
Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls)
using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and
track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for
movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of
neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it
promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment."

There is a fundamental gap in the availability of interventions that 1) sustainably improve adherence to pre-
scribed blood pressure (BP) medications, 2) identify underlying behavior change mechanisms, and 3) demon-
strate efficacy by sex and race in older adults. Accordingly, interventions to improve adherence and BP control
remain minimally effective. The long-term goal is to improve medication adherence, BP control, and healthy
aging in older hypertensive adults. The overall objective for this R01 application is to determine the efficacy of
the Supporting Tailored Adaptive change and Reinforcement for Medication Adherence Program (STAR-
MAP), which integrates the transformative Overcoming Immunity-to-Change (OITC) health coaching process,
on improving adherence, BP control, and quality of life (QOL). The OITC approach that has proven useful in
other arenas was successfully applied to BP management in the research team's recent pilot study. Based on
this prior work, the central hypothesis is that STAR-MAP, designed to help nonadherent older hypertensive
adults to identify and alter implicit attitudes that hinder medication adherence, will change mindsets and im-
prove daily taking of prescribed medications, leading to lowered BP and better QOL. The rationale for the pro-
posed study is that demonstration of the efficacy of STAR-MAP would provide new opportunities to overturn
nonadherent behavior and improve BP control and healthy aging for the growing population of older adults with
hypertension, overall and in sex and race subgroups. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: (1) Determine the efficacy, underlying mechanism, and sustainability of the STAR-MAP interven-
tion, aimed at improving medication-taking behavior, on medication adherence and clinical outcomes; and (2)
Explore the efficacy of STAR-MAP in sex and race subgroups. Under the first aim, a randomized controlled
trial will be conducted in 402 nonadherent (proportion of days covered (PDC) <0.8) adults ≥65 years with un-
controlled BP (201 per arm – intervention versus usual care; 50% women; 50% black) and fully insured by Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana. The study will have 90% statistical power to detect a 15% difference at 12
months in the proportion of participants with PDC ≥0.8 between those randomized to intervention versus
usual care with attention control. Under the second aim, efficacy of STAR-MAP in sex and race subgroups
will be explored. The approach is innovative because it will be the first large clinical trial to rigorously test a new
intervention that targets negative implicit attitudes toward medications with a goal to improve adherence, BP
control, and QOL. The proposed research is significant because it will represent an important step in a contin-
uum of research that is expected to lead to an efficacious, scalable intervention (with data on the underlying
behavior change mechanism). Finally, the results are expected to provide new insights on an underappreciated
psychological mechanism (i.e., implicit attitudes) of nonadherence that could be useful for improving the effec-
tiveness of other medication adherence interventions."

 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the slow
component of excitatory post-synaptic currents and play important roles in normal brain function. Genetic
variations in GRIN genes, which encode the GluN subunits, are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders,
including epileptic encephalopathy, autism, and intellectual disability, which carry devastating mental and
economic consequences for the individuals, their families, and society. Following the first report on disease-
causing GRIN variants in 2010, a large number of human variants (>300) in GRIN genes have been identified
in pediatric patients with various neurologic problems. Our studies in the previous funding cycle indicated that
similar phenotypes (i.e. seizures) could result from both gain-of-function (GoF) and loss-of-function variants
(LoF) in the same gene. Our work also revealed that different GRIN variants present differential sensitivity to
FDA-approved drugs, and there are divergent responses to the same treatment among three unrelated patients
hosting the same variant in “N of 1” trials. The proposed experiments will provide the first detailed evaluation
of circuit function following LoF and GoF NMDAR at different developmental stages, and address how the two
opposite effects on NMDARs might generate a similar phenotype. These studies will define a critical window in
which circuit connections relevant for aberrant activity are established, and will advance opportunities for
personalized medicine by suggesting new therapeutic strategies for mitigation of functional changes.
Specific Aim 1: Functional assessment of newly identified disease-associated GRIN variants and evaluation of
GRIN2A variants in the general population. We will analyze the functional properties of all newly published
and unpublished disease-associated GRIN variants in the understudied regions of the receptors. We will
determine the relationship between protein function and allelic frequency in healthy individuals, and evaluate
the idea that variation of intolerant genes can act as risk factors for neurological disorders.
Specific Aim 2: How does the loss of NMDAR activity promote network hyperexcitability and induce epileptic
phenotypes? We will evaluate in vivo knockin mice hosting two LoF variants and GluN2A knockout mice to
explore whether loss of NMDAR function reduces synaptic inhibition and leads to network hyperexcitability.
Specific Aim 3: What is the mechanism of gain-of-function GRIN variant-associated early-onset epileptic
encephalopathy? We will use in vivo knockin mouse models for three GoF GRIN variants to determine
whether enhanced NMDAR function drives seizures and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.
Specific Aim 4: How can GRIN/NMDAR channelopathies best be treated? We will screen ~2,000 FDA-
approved drugs for their ability to rectify GRIN variant-induced hyperexcitability. We will evaluate actions of
FDA-approved drugs on transgenic mice to determine if the excitation/inhibition imbalance can be restored."

The immediate establishment of the latent HIV-1 reservoir in resting memory CD4+ T cells precludes HIV-1 cure,
compelling ART for a lifetime in children. The mission of the PAVE Collaboratory is to use cutting-edge science
to establish a deep and broad understanding of the immunopathogenesis of pediatric HIV-1 reservoirs, across
the age spectrum, and to demonstrate preclinical safety and efficacy of novel therapeutics to eradicate reservoirs
and control rebound that will pave the way for future interventional human studies toward a lifetime of sustained
HIV-1 control off ART. We hypothesize that the unique features of the infant immune system at the time of
reservoir establishment impact the characteristics of long-term virus persistence, susceptibility to immune-
mediated clearance, and reactivation that are distinct from adult infections, warranting in-depth investigation to
inform cure therapeutics suitable for children. We will test this hypothesis and execute the PAVE Scientific
Agenda through accomplishment of the following Specific Aims: 1. Define the establishment and evolution of
the HIV latent reservoir in perinatal infection. 2. Enhance pediatric immunity and broadly neutralizing
antibody (bNAb) delivery to achieve post-treatment control of HIV-1 off ART. 3. Deploy immune-targeted
strategies to eliminate virus reservoirs. 4. Optimize virologic, immunologic, and imaging methods to
assess efficacy of HIV-1/S(H)IV cure interventions. 5. Foster community engagement in pediatric HIV
cure research. The PAVE program is multidisciplinary, multicultural, and iterative with a nimble structure
encompassed by four highly synergistic Research Foci and a domestic and international community program
that will rapidly incorporate new scientific directions and feedback from our stakeholders. The PAVE leadership
team spans diverse scientific expertise and exhibits additional diversity in terms of gender, academic rank, and
country of origin. Each of the Research Foci also includes junior faculty co-Investigators to facilitate their career
development within the HIV-1 research space. Through the collective efforts of our scientific leadership,
Executive Committee, Scientific Advisory Board, investigators, industry partners, network collaborations, and
domestic and international community program, PAVE anticipates meeting the following overall milestones of:
1) understanding early life immunity and early antiretroviral treatment on the composition and stability of the
latent reservoir, including in naïve T cells, and potential for HIV-1 remission; 2) eliminating of these reservoirs in
pre-clinical studies of immune-targeted strategies; 3) defining the role of myeloid cells in HIV-1 persistence and
rebound, including in the CNS; 4) establishing novel approaches to enhance pediatric immunity through active
and passive immunization; 5) developing cutting-edge approaches to quantify and monitor proviral reservoirs to
measure clinical trial efficacy, and 6) promoting active community engagement in pediatric HIV-1 cure research.
These milestones will help achieve the vision of sustained ART-free control of HIV-1 replication in pediatric
populations."

Among malignant complications of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most common cancers
in the pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era — Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) — continues to be amongst the
most common in the ART era. Despite a decline in mortality in the ART era, KS survival is still
unacceptably poor, and many questions remain regarding mortality after KS diagnosis in the ART era.
These questions span epidemiology and clinical management. With much yet to be learned, and as a
direct response to the urgent need for effective strategies to improve survival of patients with HIV-related
KS, the overall goal of this mentored career development proposal is to support Dr. Helen Byakwaga in
acquiring the knowledge and skills to become an independent investigator in clinical and translational
HIV-associated cancer research, with a focus on efforts to reduce KS mortality among HIV-infected
individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa. Dr. Byakwaga has developed a research proposal linked to a career
development plan, both of which are supported by a multi-faceted mentoring team that will guide her in
completing the research and transitioning to an internationally competitive independent scientist.
The specific aims are:
Aim 1: Determine excess risk of mortality associated with KS among HIV-infected adults in East Africa;
Aim 2: Identify potential biologic determinants of mortality among HIV-infected adults with a new
diagnosis of KS; and
Aim 3: Develop and validate a prediction model for mortality among individuals with HIV-related KS
This project will determine the true magnitude of the impact of KS on mortality among HIV-infected
individuals in the ART era, identify potential pathways that can be targeted to attenuate KS progression,
and develop an algorithm to predict those at highest risk for death after KS diagnosis and for whom rapid
interventions are most warranted. Overall, this proposal describes a comprehensive menu of research
and career development activities consisting of mentoring and coursework that will help Dr. Byakwaga to
achieve her research objectives and become an independent researcher."

ply computational tools to advance structure-based drug design. The objective of this proposal is to apply new
computational protocols based on the cutting-edge molecular simulation and quantum calculation tools to tackle
several critical topics in the rational design of reversible and targeted covalent inhibitors (TCI) of kinases. Kinases
phosphorylate a third of the proteome and deregulation of kinase functions is a major strategy to modulate cancer,
autoimmune and inﬂammatory conditions. In recent years, reversible and covalent kinase inhibitors are gaining
FDA approvals at a rapidly growing speed.
Supported by our new tool developments, pilot studies, unpublished preliminary data, as well as working hypothe-
ses, we will pursue three speciﬁc aims: 1) conduct kinome and proteome wide computational proﬁling studies to
identify covalent targetable sites; 2) elucidate the reaction mechanisms and structure-reversibility relationships
for chemical warhead design; and 3) elucidate the mechanisms controlling selectivity and kinetics of reversible
kinase inhibitors. The outcomes of the studies will guide the current efforts in TCI discovery for kinases and
the search for new druggable targets; provide detailed knowledge for attenuating reactivity and reversibility of
chemical warheads to minimize toxicity; and offer new strategies to improve selectivity and kinetic parameters
of reversible inhibitors. Successful completion of the project will allow us to build a computational platform to

 The HIV research agenda in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is far-reaching. Much of it has been
developed and carried out in partnership with institutions in the United States, Canada, and Europe, leading to
gains in local capacity in terms infrastructure and professional development of scientists and physicians. One
important domain where capacity building still lags behind is biostatistics and quantitative sciences: African
biostatisticians are severely under-represented in international research teams, and many HIV research
programs in SSA continue to rely on their partners from the Global North for implementation of advanced
methods for design and analysis. Although the past 5 years have seen substantial advances in research and
educational capacity, many leading universities in SSA are only beginning to develop graduate-level training in
statistics for health research. Statistics training in Kenya has typically been theoretical in nature, with applied
work focusing primarily on biometry and agricultural statistics.
 Moi University, the second largest in Kenya, is typical in this regard. During Phase 1 of this training
program, Moi began the process of implementing a graduate biostatistics curriculum. However there are only
two faculty at Moi with PhD in biostatistics, highlighting the need for expansion of expertise among current faculty
and development of potential new faculty members. At the College of Health Sciences, there continues to be
high demand for masters-level statisticians to engage in externally funded research. Finally, the small number
of African statisticians with advanced training working in HIV research centers in SSA tend to be geographically
isolated from their peers, limiting opportunities for professional development and exchange of ideas.
 The proposed training program will respond to these needs by launching Phase 2 of a partnership
between Moi and Brown Universities. The program will expand research and curricular capacity in HIV-related
biostatistics and advanced quantitative methods at Moi and lay the foundation for sustainable growth in this field
by accomplishing the following Specific Aims: (1) provide masters-level training at Brown (2 trainees, 2 years
each), PhD training in a sandwich program at Moi and Brown (2 trainees, 4 years each), and postdoctoral training
at Brown and Moi (2 trainees, 2 years each; (2) facilitate revision and expansion of the biostatistics curriculum
at Moi through faculty development and faculty fellowships (4 trainees, 1 year each); (3) continue an annual
workshop on advanced biostatistical methods at Moi that will offer short-term training and ongoing professional
development activities for faculty members and professionals throughout SSA; and (4) lay the groundwork for a
Center for Health Data Science on the campus of Moi University.
 This proposal builds directly upon the accomplishments and experiences from Phase 1 of the partnership,
which provided training to 6 Kenyan statisticians; 4 masters students, 1 faculty fellow and 1 research fellow.
Four of the six trainees are working at Moi or AMPATH in Eldoret, and one is pursuing a PhD in biostatistics."

Gonorrhea is a major public health problem globally. About 87 million new cases of gonorrhea occur worldwide
annually. In 2018, 583,405 cases were reported in the U.S, an 82.6% increase in disease incidence since the
historic low in 2009. Concomitant infection with HIV and gonorrhea can increase rates of HIV transmission 5-
fold. Dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome (i.e., bacterial vaginosis (BV)) increases the risk of gonorrhea and
HIV acquisition and transmission. Serious sequelae of gonorrhea in women include infertility, ectopic
pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) has become resistant to almost every antibiotic
in clinical use. Reports of resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin from almost every continent portends an
era of untreatable gonorrhea. Development of novel therapies against Ng is a global public health priority.
Gonococci deploy a unique immune evasion strategy wherein it caps its lipooligosaccharide (LOS) by a
surface LOS sialyltransferase (Lst) using host-derived CMP-Neu5Ac. LOS sialylation enables Ng to evade
several aspects of host immunity, including complement and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). We
discovered that gonococci fed with CMP-nonulosonates (CMP-NulOs), such as CMP-legionaminic acid (CMP-
Leg5,7Ac2) and CMP-ketodeoxynonulosonate (CMP-Kdn) cap their LOS with these NulOs. Incorporation of
NulOs into Ng LOS renders bacteria susceptible to complement and CAMPs. Importantly, CMP-NulOs
significantly shorten the duration and burden of Ng vaginal colonization in mice. Cathelicidin (a member of the
CAMP family) played a key role in the MOA of CMP-NulOs. Our efficacy, safety and stability studies have
established CMP-Leg5,7Ac2 and CMP-Kdn as promising candidates for intravaginal delivery to prevent Ng
acquisition. In years 1-2 of Aim 1, the NRC will produce CMP-NulOs for all work in this proposal, perform a
pharmacoeconomic analysis and assess scale-up. Process development, quality release assays, development
of potency assays and stability in simulated genital tract fluids of the identified lead will follow in years 3-5. Aim
2 will elucidate factors that may affect safety efficacy of CMP-NulOs. These include effects of CMP-NulOs on
growth and viability of favorable or unfavorable vaginal bacteria, the effects of sialidases elaborated by BV-
associated pathogens and naturally-occurring anti-NulO antibodies on the efficacy of CMP-NulOs in vitro and
in vivo, examining cervicovaginal secretions for CMP-NulO hydrolase activity and testing the specificity of
CAMPs to bind NulO-containing glycans to refine the MOA of CMP-NulO against Ng. Aim 3 will formulate the
CMP-NulOs into intravaginal rings (IVRs), perform PK studies in vitro and in a sheep model, and examine
biofilm formation by vaginal microbiota on IVRs. Work in years 1-2 of the Aims 1-3 will identify a single lead;
works in years 3-5 will focus on further product development and IND-enabling activities. Aim 4 will verify
activity of the lead CMP-NulO against genetically and geographically diverse Ng isolates. Aim 5 includes
regulatory guidance and oversight for all Aims that will culminate in a pre-IND meeting with the FDA."

Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) to treat pediatric severe obesity is increasingly common. MBS at younger
ages means decades longer to preserve or enhance its cardiometabolic and other health benefits. While mean
weight loss after MBS is substantial, >50% of adolescents in prospective US cohorts have persistent severe
obesity >3 years later. We have also found that 25% of youth show significant weight regain 6 months through
5 years postoperatively. Additionally, comorbidity response to MBS appears to differ between youth and adults.
In youth, few predictors of weight loss after MBS are known and there is insufficient mechanistic data evaluating
physiologic factors as potential predictors. Further, there is an absence of in-depth cardiometabolic phenotyping,
which could help to define residual risk post MBS beyond weight loss alone. We hypothesize that 1) physiologic
phenotypes in gut peptides, body composition, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) will partially explain variability
in MBS weight loss in adolescents (Aim 1), that improved insulin sensitivity (IS) will be associated with favorable
cardiovascular changes independent of BMI change (Aim 2), and 2) Adjunctive postoperative glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) pharmacotherapy will augment MBS benefits in youth with suboptimal surgical response. I
propose a 2-phase design: a 1-year prospective study measuring changes in gut peptides, body composition,
RMR, and cardiometabolic measures (IS, 24 hour blood pressure, echocardiogram for structure/function, arterial
stiffness, cardiac autonomic function) from pre- to 1 year post-MBS (n=30), 2) A randomized, double-blinded, 6-
month intervention of semaglutide vs placebo 1-2 years postop in 12-24 year olds with <20% BMI loss (n=18).
As an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics Section of Nutrition with a solid publication and grant
funding record, and emerging clinical trial experience, I am establishing myself within the field of personalized
pediatric obesity medicine. I envision future diagnostic tools and interventions for weight management in youth
that are tailored to an individual’s underlying (patho)physiology, values, and socioenvironmental influences. A
K23 would support the following research goals: 1) define physiologic phenotypes underlying MBS mechanism
and cardiometabolic response using robust measures not previously reported in youth, 2) complete the first
randomized controlled trial of a GLP-1 receptor agonist in youth post-MBS, and 3) contribute data from a diverse
cohort that particularly fills gaps in under-represented Hispanic youth. My career development plan is carefully
constructed to 1) learn how to longitudinally perform and interpret core dynamic measures of gut peptides, body
composition, energy balance, insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular health. Experience with these measures will
yield a versatile toolbox that will be highly translatable to future clinical intervention trials in pediatric obesity. 2)
gain experience with recruitment/retention for a longer study protocol (18 months), and 3) learn how traditional
study designs can inform more nimble adaptive clinical trial interventions for a subsequent R01."

Drug resistance is one of the key contributing factors to treatment failure in infectious disease. Thus, overcoming
drug resistance would significantly improve patient outcome and reduce healthcare costs. Extensive research
on genetic mechanisms of drug resistance have revealed how drugs are rendered ineffective via changes in the
DNA sequence. However, emerging evidence suggest that non-genetic mechanisms such as chromatin- and
protein-based epigenetic states may explain how drug resistance arises frequently and rapidly. Understanding
the non-genetic mechanisms that drive the evolution of drug resistance could pave the way for the development
of novel therapeutic strategies to combat drug resistance. The Research Training Plan will leverage systems
biology approaches in a leading human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to dissect the molecular underpinning
of pararesistance, a non-genetic mechanism of drug resistance (Aims 1 and 2) and examine the clinical
relevance and therapeutic potential of targeting pararesistance (Aim 3). In Aim 1, the applicant Dr. Jing Lin (Lucy)
Xie will train in single-cell RNA sequencing and ODE modeling in the K99 phase to identify the transcriptional
response and estimate the switching frequency associated with the establishment of pararesistance, developing
a quantitative framework to understand how pararesistance is established. In Aim 2, Dr. Xie will train in pooled
screen with CRISPRi in the K99 phase and complete the analysis in R00 phase to identify regulators of
pararesistance and determine how pararesistance is maintained. In Aim 3, Dr. Xie will establish the prevalence
of pararesistance in a collection of ~1,000 wild C. albicans isolates and identify chemical modulators of
pararesistance in a library of >1,000 bioactive small molecules to investigate the clinical and therapeutic
implications of pararesistance in the R00 phase. The Career Development Plan is designed to provide Dr. Xie
with the opportunity and support to acquire additional expertise in single-cell RNA-sequencing and CRISPRi
technologies and statistical and modeling methodologies, as well as additional professional development training
in teaching, writing, and lab management skills. Mentor Prof. Daniel Jarosz is a leading expert in yeast prions
and non-genetic inheritance. Complementary expertise is offered by co-mentor Prof. James Ferrell (quantitative
biology), and advisors Prof. Ami Bhatt (clinical microbiology) and Prof. Judith Berman (antifungal drug tolerance
and resistance), and collaborators Prof. Michael Hallett (single-cell technologies) and Prof. Rebecca Shapiro
(CRISPR technologies). The Stanford University School of Medicine fosters a highly collaborative and supportive
research environment and provides excellent infrastructures within a vibrant scientific community. In summary,
Dr. Xie will receive high-quality training in research and career development, and is poised to launch her own
independent research program. The proposed studies will offer mechanistic insight into non-genetic mechanisms
of drug resistance and establish a framework for developing novel therapeutics that would circumvent drug
resistance, with important implications for microbial pathogens."
10814793,"Abstract:
Coordinating transitional care for high-need/high-cost patients (HNHC); those with multiple chronic or complex
chronic conditions, functional disabilities and/or social needs; often requires collaboration with service partners
outside the health care sector. To improve care for HNHC patients, there is a critical need to: narrow the
population receiving intensive care transitions follow-up to those with the greatest need, partner with social
sector providers to improve transitional care continuity, and maximize health information technology, such as
health information exchange (HIE), to include cross-sector comprehensive shared care plans (CSCP). Our
long-term goal is to coordinate care for HNHC patients as they transition between settings to reduce low-value
utilization, improve continuity and equity, and reduce burden, while improving safety through better adherence
to treatment plans and avoided readmission. The success of our R21 Coordinating Transitions Intervention
(CTI) demonstrates the potential of HIE to support quality improvement, thereby providing a unique opportunity
to expand and refine the intervention to meet the needs of this vulnerable HNHC population. The objective of
this project is to improve the evidence-based Coordinating Transitions Intervention (CTI) to include cross-
sector continuity, risk stratification, social needs assessment, and shared care planning for HNHC patients that
can then be hardwired into HIE and used as a collaborative tool across settings. Identifying HNHC patients at
the point of transition between care settings, coupled with enhanced communication through an interoperable
shared care plan, will facilitate referrals to care management, improve continuity, and reduce reliance on low-
value care. The specific aims are to:
1) expand the scope of the R21 to include the social and behavioral health sectors as equal partners in
managing HNHC patients during care transitions, and implement the project at remote practice sites;
2) further develop the CTI 's HIE capability to segment the HNHC population into subsets with specific cross-
sector needs and expand knowledge transfer between health and social sectors (care alerts and CSCP); and
3) evaluate the impact of Personalized Cross-sector Transitional Care Management (PC-TCM) using HIE on
patient burden, care team empowerment and collaboration, and utilization value. The expected outcomes are
real-time discharge alerts that will be sent to regional providers generated by a robust algorithm that accurately
identifies segments of HNHC population in need of cross-sector care. The personalized alert will trigger the
creation of a comprehensive care plan (CSCP) curated by a professional care manager, that includes both
social and healthcare sectors, and is shared across health and social service providers using HIE. As the
intervention is implemented in primary care and behavioral health settings, we will measure the care
coordination process and outcomes, patient and provider burdens of care, and utilization."
10814217,"Project Summary
While Uganda is close to achieving the 90-90-90 targets, more than 27% of Ugandans with HIV remain with a
detectable viral load and the potential to substantially contribute to new infections. Uganda faces challenges with
HIV care and prevention, in particular for men, youth and geographically mobile subpopulations that continue to
fall short of viral suppression targets, putting them at risk for HIV complications, mortality, and onward HIV
transmission. With the aging HIV population there is increasing burden of comorbidities such as non-
communicable diseases (NCDs), and integration of NCD-HIV care is paramount to improve HIV outcomes.
Implementation science (ImS) research capacity is needed to optimize the public health impact of efficacious
interventions such as test-and-treat and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for eligible populations.
Building on existing partnerships between Makerere University (MU) and its affiliated HIV programs and the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), we have established a pioneer ImS Research Training
Program at MU focused on enhancing the cascade of HIV care. We have built a strong foundation for ImS in
Uganda through training, integrating ImS as a field of study at MU and influencing HIV practices. We propose
to continue the Program and focus the next period on creation of sustained growth of ImS research
environment at MU and the application of ImS to bear on HIV research and service delivery on a larger scale in
Uganda. The specific objectives of our research training program renewal application are to: 1) strengthen the
scientific leadership and expertise needed for implementation science research by having increased focus on
PHD training at MU; 2) expand the breadth of training in ImS implementation science research at MU; 3)
optimize utilization of resources for training by leveraging the additional available resources in Uganda
(including projects funded by the NIH, European and Developing Country Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP),
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and others; 4) strengthen trainee contributions to
evidence-based decision-making related to HIV prevention, care and treatment services through regular
interactions with policy makers and HIV program implementers; and 5) support the integration of ImS trainees
into Ugandan academic, research, policy and HIV implementing institutions to: a) pursue independent scientific
careers in ImS and b) strengthen use of ImS in HIV service delivery. The proposed ImS training program will
build on our relationships with UCSF faculty to provide a longitudinal mentorship program based on monthly
works-in-progress meetings (held virtually via online platforms). During our five-year program, we anticipate
training Ugandan trainees as follows: 4 candidates in PhD and 10 candidates in master’s degree programs at
MU, 40 candidates in a Post Graduate Diploma in Implementation science research and quality Improvement
and 6 candidates in the UCSF Online Certificate in ImS program.

10813024,"The program will strengthen patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation training of physician-scientists and
other exceptional clinicians in Mwanza, in northwestern Tanzania. The program builds upon two decades of
collaboration and capacity building by the partner institutions. The primary research institution in Tanzania will
be the Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU), which is a unit of Tanzania’s National Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR). MITU was established in 2006 as a collaboration between NIMR and the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to strengthen HIV interventional research in Tanzania. MITU
collaborates closely with the Weill Bugando School of Medicine, which is also located in Mwanza. Weill
Bugando was established in 2003 to train physicians for northwestern Tanzania. MITU and Weill Bugando
have collaborated with Weill Cornell Medical College since their founding.
This research training program aims to fill a critical gap in Mwanza: the need for Tanzanian physicians with
rigorous training in patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation. We use the NIH definition of clinical
investigation as research which directly interacts with individual patients or clusters of patients in Phase I, II, or
III clinical trials, pragmatic trials, or formative epidemiologic or behavioral research in preparation for clinical
trials. The goals of the proposed training program are: 1.To increase the number of clinical investigators at
MITU and thereby increase institutional capacity for HIV clinical investigation 2. Establish Weill Bugando/MITU
as a sustainable training center for HIV clinical investigation. The ultimate goal is to prevent new HIV
infections, provide effective HIV care, and improve HIV outcomes in Tanzania and East Africa.
We will provide long-term training to fifteen outstanding clinician scientists to conduct patient-oriented HIV
clinical investigation. We will primarily train physicians but will also train exceptional other clinicians (PharmD,
DMD). We will train 10 PhDs, and 5 MS degree candidates. Tanzanian trainees will benefit from participation
in 17 active research projects in five synergistic areas of HIV investigation including HIV prevention and
vaccine research, implementation of HIV testing and treatment, women’s health, HIV related co-infections, and
HIV and cardiovascular disease. We will also strengthen the PhD program in clinical investigation at Weill
Bugando by introducing 4 new graduate courses in clinical investigation. Weill Cornell is committing
institutional funds so that 4 of the best PhD graduates can have 2-year post-doctoral appointments as
MITU research scientists after their Fogarty training. At the end of the 5-year training program, MITU will have
a cadre of clinical investigators and a greater depth and breadth of externally funded HIV patient-oriented
research. MITU/Weill Bugando will be a training hub for HIV clinical investigators in East Africa."
10720899,"Inflammation is the body's attempt at self-protection to remove harmful stimuli and begin the healing process.
Chronic inflammation can eventually cause several diseases and conditions, including cancers, rheumatoid
arthritis, atherosclerosis, and plays a role in heart disease. The overarching goals of nominee’s research involve
elucidating molecular underpinnings of cell growth/survival and death/apoptosis with particular reference to
cancer, atheroscleroscosis, and cardiovascular hypertension.
 The American Cancer Society estimates highest percent of new cases and mortality resulting from lung
and breast cancers in females, while prostate and lung cancers account for highest percentage of new cases
and associated mortality among men. Overall incidence rates and mortality due to lung and breast cancers have
decreased over last decade partly due to advances in diagnosis and therapeutics, particularly targeted
therapeutics for a number of cancers including the non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). However, adaptive
genetic alterations and mutations in cancers contribute to therapy failures and relapses in clinic occur that often
result in emergence of resistant, hard to treat disease, and warrant development of new therapeutic strategies
to overcome drug resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes.
 By utilizing a functional gene-knockout approach the nominee identified a novel, apoptosis inducing
protein termed CARP-1/CCAR1 (J. Biol. Chem. 278: 33422-33435, 2003). CARP-1 regulates apoptosis
signaling induced by diverse therapeutics such as Adriamycin, Etoposide, and Gefitinib (Oncotarget 6(9): 6499-
510, 2015). Following CARP-1 discovery, the nominee conducted a chemical-biological approach to identify
novel small molecule CARP-1 Functional Mimetic (CFMs) compounds (J. Biol. Chem. 286 (44): 38000-38017,
2011). CFMs inhibit growth of therapy-resistant triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and non-small cell lung
cancers (NSCLCs) in part by inducing CARP-1-dependent apoptosis (Oncotarget, 7(45): 73370–73388, 2016;
8(62):104928-104945, 2017; 9(51): 29680-29697, 2018). During RCS funding, nominee made a fundamental
observation that CARP-1 interacts with NF-κB kinase subunit gamma (IKKγ). This interaction functions to
activate NF-κB-dependent cell survival and growth in genotoxic chemotherapy-treated cancer cells (J. Biol.
Chem. 295: 3532-3552, 2020). Targeting of IKKγ-CARP-1 binding prevents therapy-induced NF-κB activation.
On the basis of this finding nominee discovered new compounds, termed selective NF-κB inhibitors (SNIs), that
target IKKγ-CARP-1 binding to attenuate therapy-induced survival pathways and enhance efficacy of cisplatin in
preclinical tumor models of breast and renal cancers. Given that cisplatin is widely used anti-cancer therapeutic
in BRCA-mutant breast, non-small cell lung, and kidney cancers, SNI compounds will provide a novel avenue to
improve chemotherapy efficacy and attenuate emergence of drug-resistant cancers. The nominee’s long-term
goal is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of therapy resistance in TNBC and NSCLCs, and utilize this
knowledge to develop novel, safer and effective anti-cancer modalities. In this context CFMs and SNIs or their
derivatives are anticipated to facilitate development of strategies for effective treatment of TNBC, NSCLCs, and
other cancers in the VA healthcare system and beyond.
 Prevalence of atherosclerotic reno-vascular hypertension is rising. Renal artery stenosis occurs in 28%
of veterans undergoing cardiac catheterization with a greater than 3-fold risk in those over age 65. There is an
alarming burden of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality with attendant increases in direct medical
costs, loss of productivity and quality of life in our Veterans with hypertension. The nominee continues to have a
productive collaboration with Detroit VA clinician-scientist to study the molecular and behavioral mechanisms of
the angiotensin-endothelin signaling in Reno-vascular model. In RCS funding period, nominee served as a co-
investigator of the two VA funded Merit applications that investigated mechanisms of reno-vascular hypertension."
10844442,"Project Summary
Time is the fundamental dimension of sound, and temporal integration is thus fundamental to speech perception.
To recognize a complex structure such as a word in fluent speech, the brain must integrate across many different
timescales spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds. These timescales are considerably longer than the
duration of responses at the auditory nerve. Therefore, the auditory cortex must integrate acoustic information
over long and varied timescales to encode linguistic units. On the other hand, the nature of the intermediate units
of representation between sound and meaning remains debated. Focal brain injuries have shown selective
impairment at all levels of linguistic processing (phonemic, phonotactic, and semantic) but current models of
spoken word recognition disagree on the existence and type of these representational levels. The neural basis
of temporal and linguistic processing remains speculative partly due to the limited spatiotemporal resolution of
noninvasive human neuroimaging techniques which is needed to study the encoding of fluent speech. Our multi-
PI proposal overcomes these challenges by assembling a team of researchers and clinicians with
complementary expertise at NYU and Columbia University. We propose to record invasively from a large number
of neurosurgical patients, which provides a rare and unique opportunity to collect direct cortical recordings across
several auditory regions. We propose novel experimental paradigms and analysis methods to investigate where,
when, and how acoustic features of speech are integrated over time to encode linguistic units. Our experimental
paradigms will determine the functional and anatomical organization of stimulus integration periods in primary
and nonprimary auditory cortical regions and relate the temporal processing in these regions to the emergence
of phonemic-, phonotactic-, and semantic-level representations. Finally, we will determine the nonlinear
computational mechanisms that enable the auditory cortex to integrate fast features over long durations, which
is essential in speech recognition. Understanding of the temporal processing of speech in primary and
nonprimary auditory cortex is critical for developing complete models of speech perception in the human brain,
which is essential to understanding of how these processes break down in speech and communication disorders."
10847376,"SUMMARY
Arithmetic and reading are the most fundamental skills acquired during elementary school and are crucial for
successful academic achievement, employment prospects, and mental health. Despite the significance of
arithmetical and reading skills, many children and adults in developed societies exhibit deficient reading and
arithmetical abilities. Accumulating evidence suggests a strong neurocognitive and genetic link between reading
and arithmetic, with high co-occurrence rates of both reading and arithmetical learning difficulties. However, the
developmental trajectories of typical and atypical arithmetical and reading skills have been predominantly studied
apart and potential shared mechanisms of typical and atypical reading and arithmetic development are unknown.
This application proposes a longitudinal investigation that aims to (a) compare typical and atypical developmental
trajectories of reading and arithmetic from kindergarten to third grade, (b) characterize similarities, differences,
and classification power of neural and cognitive measures to profile the shared mechanisms underlying
arithmetic and reading, and (c) determine a set of predictors in kindergarten predicting arithmetic and reading
outcome after four years of formal instruction.
Employing a longitudinal study design, the proposed project aims to investigate the developmental relationships
of reading and arithmetic in the typical and atypical development of arithmetical skills from the beginning of
kindergarten to third grade, in 180 children with either a familial risk for arithmetic difficulties (AD), a familial risk
for reading difficulties (RD), or without any familial risk for reading or arithmetical difficulties, using functional and
structural brain measures and behavioral correlates. Neural correlates of arithmetic, reading, and related sub-
skills, together with a comprehensive psychometric battery measuring reading and arithmetical development and
domain-general and domain-specific skills, will be examined four times over four years during critical stages of
acquiring literacy and numerical concepts. By targeting children with a family history of AD and RD, and due to
the genetic profile overlap of these two conditions, the probability of children exhibiting atypical reading and
arithmetic development is increased, which will allow us to study and compare the developmental trajectories of
both typical and atypical reading and arithmetical skills.
This study has the potential to provide a model for understanding developmental learning disabilities, their
underlying mechanisms, and their co-occurrence. The current focus on a reactive, deficit-driven instead of a
preventive model in the field of learning disabilities is detrimental for students, as interventions have been proven
to be most effective at an earlier age of heightened brain plasticity and because of the implications for mental
health in struggling students as a result of a “wait-to-fail” approach. Understanding the shared and distinct
underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms between typical and atypical arithmetic and reading skills and their
precursors are of great significance for the development of early screening, diagnostic, and intervention tools."
10806975,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Leptin, originally identified as a regulator of energy metabolism, is required for normal bone growth and
turnover, making the adipokine an attractive candidate for coupling optimal bone accrual and turnover
balance to energy availability. However, not all skeletal actions of leptin are beneficial; there is compelling
evidence that leptin contributes to aging-related skeletal pathologies by promoting a proinflammatory cascade
mediating inflammation-driven bone loss. The molecular mechanisms mediating the skeletal actions are
poorly defined. We have strong preliminary data indicating that leptin influences bone metabolism, both
beneficially and detrimentally, by activating leptin receptor (OB-R) on cells (predominately immune cells)
derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Based on this, we hypothesize that: (1) leptin signaling by
immune cells is necessary for normal bone growth, maturation and turnover, but (2) in the presence of
chronic inflammation, leptin signaling by immune cells promotes net bone loss. The proposed research will
test these hypotheses in male and female mice by accomplishing two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1:
Determine the contribution of leptin signaling by immune cells to bone accrual and turnover balance.
We will reconstitute the immune system of growing and adult male and female mice with HSCs from OB-R+
wild type (WT) or OB-R- db/db mice using adoptive transfer to establish the overall contribution of OB-R on
immune cells to leptin regulation of bone accrual in growing mice and turnover balance in adult mice,
respectively. We will then determine if the skeletal actions of leptin are primarily mediated via OB-R on cells
in the osteoclast lineage by adoptively transferring OB-R+ and OB-R- monocytes into mice with reduced
ability to form osteoclasts (Ccr2- mice). Specific Aim 2: Determine the contribution of leptin signaling by
immune cells to inflammation-driven bone loss. We will reconstitute the immune system of growing and
adult male and female mice with HSCs from OB-R+ or OB-R- mice as in Specific Aim 1 and induce local
inflammation by placing polyethylene particles over calvaria to model aseptic periprosthetic bone loss. These
studies will establish the overall contribution of OB-R on immune cells to inflammation-driven bone loss. The
contribution of OB-R on immune cell subsets to normal bone turnover balance and particle-induced osteolysis
in adult mice will then be evaluated following engraftment of subsets of OB-R+ and OB-R- immune cells into
mice unable to generate/recruit monocytes (Ccr2-), T-cells (Tcra KO), B-cells (muMT-), or mast cells (KitW-sh).
Successful completion of this research will have a major impact on the field by expanding existing concepts
regarding the role of leptin in skeletal health and disease. Our approach will provide a powerful tool for
unraveling mechanisms mediating the complex actions of leptin on the skeleton and immune systems. The
proposed research has the potential to provide new insights for the development of interventions to interrupt
leptin-mediated inflammatory cascades without compromising the beneficial skeletal actions of the adipokine."

The mission of University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center Cancer Hematopoiesis and Immunology (CHI)
Program is to generate new insights into the nature and biology of immunity and hematopoiesis during
homoeostasis and in the settings of cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The CHI program’s
overarching goals are to delineate molecular mechanisms regulating immune/hematopoietic cells, their
interactions with the microenvironment, and the development of therapeutic strategies that can be translated in
an inter-programmatic manner. The CHI Program has $18.1M in annual direct funding (69% peer-reviewed),

10827446,"Project Summary: Overall
Despite the enormous suffering endured by millions of people worldwide, the underlying causes of Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) are unknown and effective therapies are lacking.
ME/CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, headaches, cognitive difficulties
orthostatic intolerance, and sleep disturbances. The absence of simple objective tests prevents many from
obtaining an appropriate diagnosis and inhibits drug development because of the lack of biomarkers to monitor
the efficacy of experimental therapies. In order to gain fundamental mechanistic insights into ME/CFS, we will
leverage the experience, capabilities and varied backgrounds of researchers from four different colleges at
Cornell University, Florida Atlantic University, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and an ME/CFS expert
physician. We will take advantage of an enormous amount of data already obtained from patients and controls
both before and after symptom provocation through exercise, as well as a valuable set of new samples. Three
research projects will seek to (1) use cutting-edge multi-omic single cell profiling to examine alterations in cell
types, gene expression, and cell-cell interactions that occur in ME/CFS muscle (Project 1), (2) identify tissue
injured in ME/CFS following exercise through characterization of RNA released into circulation and (3) identify
the RNA and protein cargo of extracellular vesicles in ME/CFS patients that may alter function of target cells
(Project 2) and (4) Use genomic and computational methods to better understand the gene regulatory
mechanisms that result in immune dysregulation in ME/CFS and systematically identify ME/CFS-specific
alterations in signaling across the immune system (Project 3). These three research projects are supported
by a Research Core that will act as a resource for genomics technology expertise, reagents, and services and
for data management and integrated analysis. Multi-omic analysis and predictive modeling carried out in all
three Projects will provide a foundation for future development of therapeutics and diagnostic tests. All Center
activities will be coordinated through an Administrative Core, which will foster synergy and integration within
the Center, while also being the platform for collaboration with other ME/CFS Collaborative Research Centers,
a Patient/Advocate/Caregiver Committee, other ME/CFS researchers, and the Data Management Coordinating
Center. The Administrative Core will also be responsible for outreach activities that are designed to increase
awareness and understanding of ME/CFS within the research community, health professionals, and the
general public, and will administer a pilot project program designed to bring new ideas and researchers into the
ME/CFS field."
10833553,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Newborn health has improved in the United States in recent decades yet still lags that of other high-income
countries. A critically important yet understudied reason for this disappointing gap is the nature of the inpatient
care received by newborns and the effects this has on health during the first year of life. Neonatal care and
outcomes have been shown to vary markedly from hospital to hospital and between neonatal intensive care
units (NICUs), yet little is known about the causes and consequences of this variation, particularly for lower-risk
(e.g., less premature) newborns, who occupy most NICU beds today; few studies have examined how widely
differing patterns of care are linked to post-discharge outcomes. Our long-term goal is to extend our previous
descriptive studies of newborn-care variation to investigate and identify the temporal sequence of risk, medical
care, and outcomes through the first year of life. We will do so using a population-based cohort of 1.13 million
Medicaid-insured Texas newborns (54% of Texas births, 1 in 18 of US births). This unique dataset, developed
by members of our team, links maternal and newborn Medicaid claims/encounters to natality and mortality
records. Our central hypothesis is that newborn care, and subsequent infant health outcomes, are strongly
associated with specific, modifiable aspects of newborn and post-discharge care. We will study five gestational
age singleton cohorts: (1) very preterm, (2) moderately preterm, (3) early preterm, (4) early term, and (5) term.
In Aim 1, we will investigate the association of neonatal hospital care with hospital characteristics. We will then
test the association of these care patterns with mortality and morbidity (severe conditions, readmissions, and
ER use) during the inpatient period plus 7 days post-discharge. In Aim 2, the observation period is extended to
one-year post-discharge, with additional outcomes such as infant diagnoses derived from claims and multiple
weight measurements obtained from the Women, Infants, and Children Nutritional Program. We will test
associations of these risk-adjusted outcomes with birth-hospital characteristics, neonatal care, and post-
neonatal care. In Aim 3, we investigate the possible amplifying effects of hospital-level maternal race and
ethnicity composition on the foregoing analyses. This project will significantly advance our knowledge of
newborn care and outcomes for a large, diverse total birth cohort through the first year of life, providing
detailed information about determinants of early health. The findings will create actionable opportunities to
improve perinatal care delivery through policy development and new clinical improvement initiatives."

The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) utilizes the Cancer Center Support
Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds to invest in initiatives that support the priorities and goals of the 2021-2025
Strategic Plan. This plan is informed by the evolving scientific expertise needed within the Center’s three
research programs and the priorities articulated by the community, which identify the scientific questions related
to cancers with the highest incidence, mortality, and disparate outcomes within MCC’s catchment area
communities. During the new CCSG project period, the MCC requests $300,193 per year in Developmental
Funds, representing 18% of the overall CCSG annual direct award. These Developmental Funds will be used to
support two categorial areas: 1) Pilot Research Funding: $200,000 per year will be leveraged with other MCC
philanthropic, state, and/or institutional funding to support innovative pilot research projects, which have been
selected through a competitive review process; and 2) Recruitment of New Faculty Investigators: $100,193
per year will be combined with other MCC and VCU financial commitments to support start-up packages for new
scientists strategically recruited to expand the Center’s research expertise and capabilities across cancer-related
domains in basic, clinical, and population sciences."
10850943,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) Senior Leadership and its multi-
level planning and evaluation structures are instrumental to the Center’s ability to identify and prioritize new
strategic opportunities for growth; perform formative and summative evaluation for all efforts across the MCC
research, clinical, and educational domains; and ensure continuous alignment with the Center’s mission, vision,
and goals. The MCC Director, Robert A. Winn, MD, who was recruited and appointed in late 2019 as the MCC’s
fourth Director since the Center first received National Cancer Institute designation in 1975, leads a Senior
Leadership team that includes a Deputy Director and nine Associate Directors who collectively govern as part of
an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee fosters a dynamic, inclusive, and interactive environment in
which creative planning, rigorous evaluation, targeted investments, and policy developments occur. This Senior
Leadership team is guided by a detailed five-year strategic plan, reviewed and revised in late 2020, which was
informed by many stakeholders including representatives from the community, Center investigators, VCU
leaders, staff, and students/trainees. Seven overarching pillar goals, six core values, articulated disease and
mitigating behavioral risk priorities, and dozens of strategies were delineated as part of the 2021-2025 Strategic
Plan. Rooted in a Community-to-Bench framework where community engagement is front and center in
everything the Center does, the plan also features crosscutting themes focused on addressing cancer disparities
and improving survivorship in MCC’s catchment area. The Senior Leadership relies on regular advice and
engagement from multiple external advisory entities to evaluate the strategic plan implementation, progress, and
milestones; identify resources needed; and refine and add strategies as warranted. These external advisory
entities include a Cancer Community Connection Coalition and a Massey Nation Philanthropic Board with
members from both serving on a Director’s Community Cabinet and an External Scientific Advisory Board.
Internally, the MCC relies on input from its Scientific Steering Committee, comprising Associate Directors and
Research Program Leaders and each quarter they are joined by Shared Resource Directors, to guide the
oversight and review of research development within and among the programs’ membership, devise approaches
to foster transdisciplinary and translational collaborations, and ensure they are supported by the latest
technologies and expertise. A few other select advisory Committees providing essential planning and evaluation
input to the Director and Senior Leadership include a Research Training and Education Advisory Committee;
Diversity, Equity, an Inclusion Guidance Committee; Clinical Research Leadership Committee; and a Cancer
Service Line Operational Steering Committee."
10851759,"Project Summary/Abstract
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occurs with alcohol use disorder (AUD), affecting 30-60%
of those seeking AUD treatment, and may be especially salient for women with AUD. AUD patients with
comorbid PTSD have poorer outcomes following treatment, including earlier relapse, greater substance use,
and poorer psychosocial functioning, compared with those without PTSD. Although there are a small number
of evidence-based psychotherapies that may reduce PTSD symptoms, men and women in AUD treatment
rarely receive them, even in residential AUD settings. Barriers related to cost, time, and clinician expertise
severely limit the availability of PTSD interventions in AUD treatment settings. Consequently, there is great
need for low-cost, primarily self-guided, and scalable PTSD treatments that can be delivered within existing
AUD treatment structures. PTSD Coach is a promising mobile health (m-Health) application (app) that could
address treatment gaps for men and women with AUD and comorbid PTSD. Recent preliminary data from a
community sample of individuals with PTSD symptoms, without inclusion criteria related to alcohol use,
showed that the group randomly assigned to use the app had significantly greater improvements in PTSD
symptoms relative to those in a waitlist control (Cohen’s d=0.41), and a further pilot showed that brief clinical
app support/facilitation (i.e., 4, 20-minute sessions) may boost these treatment effects. Despite its potential to
improve both PTSD and alcohol-related outcomes, PTSD Coach with brief clinical support has not been tested
as a treatment for patients with comorbid PTSD in the AUD treatment setting. Therefore, the objectives of this
project are to test whether the use of the PTSD Coach app intervention package (PTSD app + brief support) in
the residential AUD treatment setting can improve PTSD symptoms, and help sustain AUD treatment gains
during recovery. Given that prior research has found AUD-, PTSD-, and treatment-differences between men
and women, the proposed study will also evaluate potential differences in treatment effects between men and
women. To accomplish these goals, we will randomize 150 men and 150 women (total n=300) with AUD and
co-occurring PTSD in residential addictions treatment to either the PTSD Coach intervention package or the
enhanced usual care (EUC) control. All participants will complete a baseline assessment and follow-ups at 1-
(post-treatment),3-, 6-, and 12-months post-randomization. Delivering the PTSD Coach intervention during
residential AUD treatment provides an ideal opportunity for patients to benefit from the app during a period of
relative stability. This project is significant because it targets a comorbid, high-needs AUD treatment
population, improves access to care, and utilizes an m-Health intervention approach that is readily scalable.
Incorporating a promising, publicly available PTSD app into AUD treatment to address co-morbidity among
AUD patients is highly innovative. The findings from this study could have substantial public health impact by
improving treatment outcomes for patients with AUD and comorbid PTSD."

 The cellular environment is both powerful and complex, depending both on structural organization from
the micron scale down to the nanometer scale, as well as on the dynamic time-dependence of a huge array of
enzymes, the nanomachines of the cell, and their work on proteins, oligonucleotides, and small molecules.
Visible fluorescence microscopy has been a useful tool capable of non-invasively exploring cellular behavior, but
the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional imaging has severely restricted the information obtainable on
structures on a scale below ~200 nm. Because the primary biomolecular players in cells are in the size range
on the order of 10 nm, comprehensive measurements are needed on this size scale in living systems. Super-
resolution microscopy, either based on single-molecule fluorescence imaging and control of the emitting
concentration, or on stimulated emission depletion, has solved this problem by enabling access to nanoscale
position information down to the 10-40 nm regime and below. In addition, the complementary method of single-
molecule tracking provides access to the details of motions of cellular components such as motor-driven
transport or the motion of DNA or RNA. Combined with advanced three-dimensional (3D) imaging, single-particle
tracking allows the full motion of specific cellular players to be observed in their actual context at high speed. It
is a primary thrust of this work to develop and enhance both 3D super-resolution imaging and 3D single-particle
tracking in cells by pushing the boundaries of both approaches and inventing new strategies to overcome
technical limitations, which will lead to unprecedented spatial and temporal information in fixed and living cells.
 Research in the Moerner laboratory broadly seeks to address the limitations of super-resolution imaging
and single-particle tracking in cells by physical and mathematical analysis as well as by invention of new
methods. The deep motivation here is to ask the fundamental question: how can the information available from
each single molecule be maximized? Two key new microscopes are under development: 3D imaging over large
axial ranges using pupil plane phase modulations and a tilted light sheet, and a correlative method to use
cryogenic single-molecule fluorescence localizations to annotate cryo-electron tomography reconstructions.
 The methodological developments of this research will be applied to a variety of critical problems in cell
biology by continuing established collaborations and by developing new collaborations with well-known
biologists. The bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, remains as a useful model system for cellular development
needing elucidation of the superstructures and motions of biomolecules to understand the origins of asymmetric
division. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite is another fascinating organism which needs exploration with super-
resolution methods. The organization of chromatin on all scales remains to be fully understood. These and other
cell biology questions with implications for both normal and diseased function will be explored by the application
of the advanced imaging methods of this research program."

Vocal fold paralysis (VFP) is a major etiology of voice, swallowing, and airway disorders. Common causes of
VFP include extra-laryngeal neoplasm, iatrogenic injury, neurologic disorder, endotracheal intubation, and other
types of trauma. Idiopathic VFP (with no clear cause) is also common, constituting roughly 1/3 of VFP cases.
Voice restoration options for these patients are suboptimal, and there are no minimally invasive permanent
treatment options to restore vocal fold mobility and function. As a result, many patients are left with permanent
voice loss and communication impairment. This application introduces a novel approach for restoring vocal fold
muscle volume and function for the treatment of VFP. Results may lead to novel, minimally invasive options for
voice restoration in these patients. The overall goal of the application is to use an adult stem cell based therapy
(a modified muscle progenitor cell) to treat VFP. When clinically translated these cells can be derived from a
given patient, and then injected into that patient's paralyzed vocal fold as a permanent treatment, potentially
restoring both motion and function. We are currently doing preclinical testing of such a model in a large animal.
Thus, these specific aims have the overall goal of developing cellular reinnervation therapy, which, after
injection in an animal model, demonstrates: i) muscle augmentation with minimal loss of volume over time ii)
minimal to no foreign body reaction and iii) robust, selective reinnervation of the denervated laryngeal muscle.
Findings from the proposed studies should overcome the hurdles of current FDA approved laryngeal
injectables—those hurdles being complete resorption of biomaterial over time, foreign body reactions resulting
in granulomatous reaction/scarring, and lack of therapeutic reinnervation benefit (beyond a bulking effect).
Because these studies are being done now in a large animal (porcine) model, with laryngeal size and function
very similar to that of humans, findings will be highly translational. Results from these experiments should lead
to landmark clinical innovations that will be relevant to both voice restoration and treatment of other peripheral
nerve injuries."
10824392,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transplantation holds the promise of reversing the clinical course for millions of Americans afflicted with end-
stage liver disease. However, several issues limit broader access to liver transplantation and better outcomes
including an incomplete understanding of liver disease pathogenesis, the need for better therapies and
assessment of clinical outcomes, improved donor availability and access to medical care. Therefore, the long-
term objective of the Transplant Surgery Scientist Training Program (TSSTP) is to foster and support multi-
disciplinary, inter-departmental liver transplant-related research that will improve outcomes for patients with end-
stage liver diseases. We will leverage scientific advances in the life sciences across many academic disciplines,
with a goal of improving the health of pre- and post-transplantation liver patients, consistent with the mission of
NIDDK. The TSSTP will train the next generation of surgeons, hepatologists and PhD investigators in a broad
range of liver transplantation-related fields. The goals of the program are to educate trainees about the nature
of existing barriers that hinder improved access, lower complications, and improve outcomes in liver
transplantation; and to train TSSTP trainees with a deep knowledge of state-of-the art tools, methodologies, and
scientific approaches that may be used to overcome these barriers. We will apply a team science approach that
utilizes the Modular Approach to Transplant Research by Inter-disciplinary eXperts (MATRIX) model which
promotes the concept of inter-dependent, multi-disciplinary research. The MATRIX training model builds on the
interdisciplinary team science structure within the Comprehensive Transplant Center (CTC) and offers 1) a basic
and translational scientific research track within the Northwestern University Collaborative for Transplant
Research in Immuno/Hepatobiology and Biomedical Engineering (NUCTRIBE), and 2) outcomes science track
within the Northwestern University Transplant Outcomes Research Collaborative (NUTORC). Trainees will
benefit from a customized MATRIX that will incorporate multi-disciplinary mentoring from both NUCTRIBE and
NUTORC (3-5 TSSTP mentors). Each project must have a link to liver transplantation or hepatology, and
enhancing our long-term goal of improving patient care. In order to successfully reach these goals, we seek to:
1) provide inter-disciplinary training and mentorship that brings together clinicians and scientists with state-of-
the-art research methodologists; 2) sustain an administrative structure that enhances quality and diversity of the
candidate pool and trainees; 3) conduct rigorous and responsible research; 4) optimize mentor and trainee
feedback with an ongoing evaluation process to enhance the ability of the program to meet its goals and
objectives; and 5) provide training opportunities, including many lectures and seminars, that span NUCTRIBE
and NUTORC at their intersection with clinical liver transplantation. This comprehensive, multi-disciplinary
approach will allow us to enhance our liver transplantation-related research and train the next generation on
physicians and scientists so that we can improve patient care."

The purpose of the proposed training program, “Postdoctoral Training in Reproductive Mood Disorders” is to
develop researchers with expertise in both the biological basis and clinically relevant (predictive) phenotypes of
reproductive mood disorders (peripubertal depression, perinatal depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
and perimenopausal depression). This is a two-to-three year training program for MD, PhD and MD/PhD
trainees. Training will involve a broad-based and integrative perspective, involving not only psychiatry but
genetics, endocrinology, neuroscience, and obstetrics/gynecology.
With this program’s emphasis on training in pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie reproductive mood
disorders, trainees will develop mastery in the following: reproductive hormonal physiology and signaling;
methods for manipulating the reproductive system; and clinical phenomenology of reproductive mood
disorders. Additionally, trainees will develop expertise in at least one of three methodological training tracks:
Neurosciences, Genetics, or Stress Physiology. Fellows will have a primary research mentor (representing
their training track) and a secondary mentor (from a different track), thereby providing additional exposure to
both the interdisciplinarity and collaborative nature of science. In addition to experiential opportunities with
program faculty, didactics will be tailored to the individual Fellow to ensure that each achieves competence in
their chosen research track. A key element of the training as well includes an independent research project.
Thus, while the training plan is multidisciplinary, an emphasis is placed on individualizing the training
experience for the Fellows. However, through a number of program specific venues designed to bring the
Fellows together for exchange of ideas and support, the program will ensure cohesiveness among the
trainees. Fellows who complete this program will be poised to become independent researchers, having the
unique requisite foundation to examine biobehavioral mechanisms in reproductive mood disorders and the
ability to identify therapeutic biologic targets in their future independent research.
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill represents an ideal setting for the proposed program because it
possesses a well-known collaborative infrastructure, a vibrant women’s mood disorder clinical program (which
includes the first inpatient perinatal depression program in the country), and a critical mass of researchers in
reproductive mood disorders with a track record of success."

The Training Program in the Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases (MBED) is postdoctoral training program in the
Department of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School (HMS) that aims to attract and mentor talented and
motivated basic scientist trainees in vision research. The program is comprised of 33 faculty members who
conduct research in a range of areas using a broad array of methods and models. The mentors represent a
diversity of relevant disciplines including ocular immunology, vascular biology, neurobiology, regenerative
medicine, gene therapy, bioinformatics, ocular surface, and drug delivery, to name a few. Moreover, the
research faculty are focused on a number of important ocular pathologies such as age-related macular
degeneration, glaucoma, retinal degenerations, corneal inflammation, wound healing, dry eye and corneal
transplantation. This diversity provides a wide selection of training opportunities.
Since it was first established in 1997, the MBED program has trained 93 trainees, four of whom have been
under-represented minorities. Most of our trainees have continued some aspect of vision research. Their
productivity is illustrated by their publications records. Each year the Training Grant supports three trainees for
one year; each trainee spends at least two years total in training. A majority of the MBED faculty has extensive
research experience, strong publication records, and successful records of mentoring. Each faculty member
has an appointment in the department of Ophthalmology at HMS and is affiliated with Schepens Eye Research
Institute of Mass Eye and Ear, Mass Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Children’s Hospital or the Joslin
Diabetes Research Center. All mentors are funded and most are supported by the National Eye Institute (NEI).
The goal of the MBED Program is to provide trainees with expertise in cellular, biochemical and molecular
approaches as well as knowledge and proficiency with relevant disease models. Importantly, the training
provided by the MBED Program instills the ability to recognize and the address the important clinical and basic
research questions challenging ophthalmology. The faculty are highly committed mentors as evidenced by the
quality and success of their trainees. The location of the affiliated institutions in Boston provides an outstanding
research environment with access to outstanding facilities and resources. Training includes dedicated
mentoring, full-time research, didactic courses, ample opportunity for collaboration and networking, workshops
on soft skills, as well as instruction in grant and manuscript writing and review, communications skills, the
responsible conduct of research, and methods for enhancing reproducibility. Thus, MBED training
encompasses all elements required to produce independent and successful vision researchers who have deep
knowledge and understanding of the basic and clinical principles that are key to identifying and solving
important ophthalmic problems."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), the leading cause of chronic and end stage renal disease, is
characterized by excessive urinary albumin excretion followed by loss of kidney function. In DKD, over-
reabsorption of filtered albumin and/or albumin-bound palmitic acid (PA), the most abundant saturated
fatty acid (FA) in human urine, could lead to tubular cell injury and activation, which may be involved in
the induction of interstitial fibrosis and chronic reduction of renal function. However, the molecular link
between tubular and interstitial cells during DKD progression is not clear. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-
1) is a noninvasive biomarker for renal proximal tubule (PT) damage and has been identified as a
scavenger receptor for epithelial phagocytosis of lipoproteins and apoptotic cells. We hypothesize that
KIM-1 interacts with STAT3 to amplify PA-albumin reabsorption capacity and promote lipotoxicity-
induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis in progressive DKD. The hypothesis will be pursued with the following
specific aims: Aim I will in vivo determine the role of KIM-1 in tubular lipid accumulation, STAT3
activation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis during DKD onset and progression. Systematic studies will be
conducted to 1) conduct spatiotemporal analysis of KIM-1 expression, lipid accumulation, STAT3
activation, and associated lipotoxicity and fibrosis in early, middle and advanced stages of DKD in wild-
type and eNOS-/- mice and 2) determine the effects of KIM-1 deficiency on tubular lipid accumulation,
STAT3 activation, and tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis in high-fat diet-fed diabetic KIM-1-
deficient (Kim-1-/-) and Kim-1-/-/eNOS-/- mice. Aim II will in vitro determine the role and regulation of KIM-
1 and STAT3 in primary cultured cells and mature proximal tubuloids in response to different FA-albumin
overload. We will delineate the differential effects of different FA-bound albumin on KIM-1, p-STAT3,
and lipotoxicity by evaluating cell ATP depletion, intracellular lipid deposition, autophagy activity and
ER stress, cell death, and lysosomal oxidative stress in both 2D cell culture and stable human tubuloids.
In addition, we will examine if KIM-1 or STAT3 inhibition or overexpression would affect PA-albumin
overload-induced lipotoxicity and STAT3 activation in both 2D cell cultures and 3D organoids. Upon
completion of these experiments we are hopeful that KIM-1 will emerge as a druggable target for the
prevention and treatment of DKD."

The University of California Riverside (UCR) is one of the most diverse campuses in the nation
and is in one of the most rapidly growing and diverse regions of the U.S. Most undergraduate
students at UCR come from this region and are from underrepresented groups in the sciences.
Thus, there is a broad base of underrepresented (UR) students from which to select and
promote interest in a research career in biomedical or behavioral sciences. The main goal of the
MARC Program at UCR is to increase the number of UR students pursuing PhD degrees and
research careers in the biomedically-related sciences. This training grant provides a summer
Pre-MARC Development Program (9-10 students/year) to increase the eligible pool of students
for the research Trainee Program (16 positions/year; 2-3 years of training). The Objectives of
the Program are: (1) Increase the number of UCR minority students majoring in the sciences
who are qualified to become MARC Trainees through outreach to local high schools and
community colleges. (2) Increase the number of qualified students who apply to the MARC
Program by using freshman courses and discovery seminars, by synergizing with Honors and
existing Minority programs on campus, and by engaging students in Pre-MARC undergraduate
research before their sophomore year and stimulating their interest in a biomedical research
career. (3) The core of the program is preparing the MARC Trainees for graduate studies in
highly competitive research institutions. We will achieve this by immersing MARC Trainees in
intensive cutting-edge research in laboratories of Faculty Mentors on campus during the
academic year and in one other off-campus laboratory at a high-caliber research institution
during one summer; we will also provide specific classes that will prepare the Trainees to think
critically, to design and implement rigorous and ethical experiments, to learn modern research
methods, to write scientific reports/papers and fellowships, and to be efficient communicators in
front of expert and lay audiences. Guidance in applying to graduate programs will be provided.
This will give self-confidence and prepare the trainees to enter and succeed in the most
competitive graduate programs in the U.S. This program is for 5 years and proposes to train
about 48 MARC students with the goal that about 80% of them will succeed in entering high
quality PhD or MD/PhD programs in the biomedical sciences.
 Relevance: This MARC training grant will not only contribute to increase the number of
UR biomedical scientists but should also have broader impacts. MARC Scholars will be role
models that inspire new generations and help break down discriminatory barriers."

Adoptive cell therapy is a promising approach to treat cancer, but despite tremendous efforts, results of clinical
trials in human solid tumors using ACT with tumor-specific T cells expressing T-cell-receptors (TCR) or
chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) have not demonstrated the desired therapeutic responses. Recently, we
developed tumor-specific T cells loaded with the myxoma virus to overcome resistance in solid tumor ACT. We
hypothesize that anti-solid tumor activity of these T cells is mainly attributed to a special type of tumor cell
death, autosis, that has not been considered a T cell killing mechanism before but may contribute to the
observed exciting antitumor potency by targeting both antigen-positive and antigen-negative tumor cells. Aim 1
will determine the unique molecular mechanism underlying tumor cell autosis induced by the synergy of
myxoma virus-derived factor(s) with T cell-derived soluble factor(s). Aim 2 will determine the role of these
tumor-specific T cells in promoting autosis and robust host immunity to eradicate solid tumors when the
targeted antigen is expressed by only ~25% of tumor cells. Our proposed studies will identify a novel ACT
strategy endowed with the capacity to eliminate solid tumors with very high antigen heterogeneity. This
translationally relevant work holds promise to significantly advance the therapeutic index of ACT in solid
tumors and could then lay the foundation for future clinical trials."

Over the last 15 years, our NINDS-funded research has focused on understanding transmission in descending
motor pathways and spinal cord networks during motor behaviors in humans with and without spinal cord injury
(SCI), with the long-term goal of maximizing the activity of spared pathway connections to enhance recovery
potential. Our studies revealed that in people with SCI, corticospinal and reticulospinal systems contribute
differentially to muscle weakness and functionally relevant behaviors, such as fine and gross grasping
manipulations, compared with control subjects. Imbalanced contributions from these descending motor systems
were found when spasticity and muscle spasms were present, providing light for the mechanisms of hyperreflexia
following SCI. Motoneuron responsiveness to corticospinal, reticulospinal, and afferent input decreased in a task-
dependent manner. Our research group pioneered the use of spike-timing dependent plasticity in the
corticospinal pathway, from basic proof-of-principle studies on Hebbian plasticity to randomized placebo
controlled clinical trials showing that plasticity at corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses improves exercise-
mediated recovery after chronic incomplete SCI.
In this application, we request to consolidate two ongoing NINDS-funded proposals that focus on the control of
voluntary movement (R01NS090622) and spasticity and muscle spasms (R01NS100810). We will leverage our
existing knowledge to produce new research that challenges the existing paradigm by integrating information
across residual networks in the subacute and chronic phases of SCI and focuses on understanding: a)
transmission in a widespread set of spared descending motor pathways and spinal circuits, b) hyperreflexia in
these spared systems, and c) neuroplasticity-based therapies. Our research protocol will build on our past
successes using cutting-edge neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and behavioral tools. We will employ more
advanced spinal cord imaging methodologies, high-density surface electromyography recordings, and new
physiological examinations using multidimensional behavioral tools to enhance our understanding of residual
connections in humans with subacute and chronic SCI. Successful completion of this research will increase our
understanding of the neural control of movement and symptoms, including spasticity and muscle spasms, in
other neurological disorders (i.e., stroke, multiple sclerosis, and ALS). This research also may provide new
avenues for treatments and assessment of humans with SCI and other neurological disorders."
10844612,"Title: Vascular endothelial cells and macrophages coordinate neutrophil trafficking in inflammation
Abstract
Many pathological conditions occur due to or involve deregulated immune cell trafficking and/or effector function.
In particular, tissue accumulation of innate immune cells termed neutrophils (PMN) while essential for host
defense and tissue homeostasis, often leads to exacerbated inflammation.
Crossing of the endothelial barrier is the first critical regulatory step in tissue PMN effector function. Many
receptor-ligand interactions involved this cascade have been well-defined, however, cues that initiate and
terminate this process are less understood. Our data identified a novel synergistic function of endothelial cells
(ECs) and interstitial macrophages (Mϕs) in regulating this importnant process in inflamed mucosa. We found
that EC-specific cues attract Mϕs to the vessel wall, and that Mϕs extend cellular protrusions to form transient
junctions with ECs. Through these binding interactions and the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which
transport regulatory microRNAs, Mϕs can transduce the necessary signaling events in ECs to preferentially
accommodate PMN TEM. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to define mechanisms and signaling events
that regulate interstitial Mϕ recruitment and contact with the vessel wall to locally prime EC responses and guide
PMN TEM in inflamed mucosa. We will utilize state-of-the-art 2-photon intravital microscopy (2pIVM), relevant
reporter and KO mice in models of mucosal inflammation to 1. Determine how interstitial Mϕs are recruited to
interact with vascular ECs in inflamed tissue. 2. Define mechanisms by which Mϕs prime vascular ECs to form
PMN TEM hot spots. 3. Determine the extent to which Mϕ-priming of vascular ECs (hot spot formation) is required
for PMN TEM and resolution of tissue inflammation. Our studies will define new mechanisms of PMN trafficking,
and likely identify new molecular targets to improve resolution of inflammation."
10874384,"This is a new pre-doctoral training grant application in Translational and Molecular Sciences (TMS) at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Currently, too few PhD graduates are entering the workforce with
sufficient training in pathobiology of disease and translational experiences to effectively translate molecular
advances into clinical practice. This proposal addresses this need with our goal being to provide a training
environment that develops the necessary skills for the next generation of PhD biomedical scientists to
incorporate translational objectives into their research and prepare them for the workforce of tomorrow. Our
recent experiences in graduate education show increased demand from students for training in translational
research. A major challenge in effective training in translational sciences for pre-doctoral students is the need
to incorporate multiple disciplines and concepts ranging from understanding disease mechanisms,
understanding of how findings may be translated in academia or industry, to understanding regulatory oversight
procedures and rules. We propose a 2 year program (with 6 students per year) with students enrolling at the
beginning of their second year. An integrative curriculum is proposed that involves didactic elements (that
includes understanding disease mechanisms, drug discovery and development, translational research
administration), career and translational research enrichment activities (including enrollment in a Certificate
program in Translational and Molecular Sciences, academia and industry workshops, CTSA interactions and
team based exercises that foster innovation, entrepreneurship and requisite skills and knowledge for
commercializing discoveries) and meaningful clinical / patient interaction experiences, the latter of which will be
linked with the trainees’ research interests. We feel that providing students with training in translational research
early during a student’s matriculation will develop skills and enable them to incorporate translational thinking into
their research and prepare them for the diverse requirements for the future workforce. To achieve this, we have
assembled 60 training faculty with well-funded laboratories and a unique array of expertise and experience that
address fundamental scientific problems with a strong emphasis on translation and human disease. Several
disease areas that are perennial strengths of UAB are represented and will provide breadth for students in
diverse research disciplines. This proposal underscores our previous and ongoing commitment to pre-doctoral
education and our collective goal of providing an environment for students to learn and develop the skills they
will require to be successful in the biomedical research and other science related occupations."
10869868,"Approximately 750,000 adults in the United States (US) have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), where they
require either dialysis or a kidney transplant in order to survive. Although in-center hemodialysis (HD) is the
most common treatment for ESKD, it is associated with extremely high costs and poor health outcomes.
Advances in communications technologies, combined with broad access to these technologies, have led many
US policymakers and healthcare providers to champion telehealth as a way to improve access to care and to
reduce costs in various healthcare settings, including the monitoring and treatment of patients with chronic
disease. Until recently, regulatory barriers have effectively prohibited physicians from using telemedicine to
deliver in-center HD care. This changed in March 2020, when emergency waivers issued in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic allowed nephrology practitioners (nephrologists and advanced practitioner providers
(APPs)) to deliver up to 4 encounters per month to HD patients via telemedicine. In the context of existing care
gaps and inefficiencies associated with the current system of physician reimbursement for dialysis care, there
are several ways in which telemedicine might improve dialysis care. Medicare’s 3-tiered monthly capitated
payment (MCP) system of reimbursing physicians for in-center HD care encourages nephrologists to see
patients up to 4 times per month, often with little or no benefits resulting from frequent visits. Paradoxically,
patients most likely to benefit from closer nephrology supervision (such as those recently discharged from the
hospital) are, on average, less likely to be seen frequently. By reducing the amount of time nephrologists
spend traveling to dialysis facilities to see patients frequently, telehealth could make it easier for practitioners to
align their rounding schedules with the needs of their patients and could reduce costs associated with time
spent traveling. Alternatively, if telehealth is used to replace interactions that are better conducted face-to-face
(such as vascular access examinations or dry weight assessments) or to see patients frequently who don’t
require closer supervision, then the adoption of telehealth could impair health and increase costs. We propose
3 specific aims that will leverage the recent increase in the use of telehealth following the COVID-19 outbreak
in order to assess the uptake of telemedicine for in-center maintenance HD care, to understand whether the
use of telehealth for in-center HD practitioner care affects healthcare costs and patient health outcomes, and to
describe patient and provider perspectives on telehealth in in-center HD. We propose a mixed-methods
approach that includes secondary analyses of several large administrative dialysis databases which we will
complement with semi-structured interviews of nephrology practitioners. When the current emergency waivers
granting broad access to telehealth end, policy makers and the clinical community will need to determine the
future role of telemedicine for in-center HD care. Our findings will inform these decisions by providing crucial
information about the benefits and potential dangers of telemedicine in this setting."

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is prominently secreted at mucosal surfaces and coats a fraction of the intestinal
bacterial microbiota. In health and disease, secretory IgA (sIgA) binding influences intestinal immunity and
homeostasis by crosslinking microbiota in the lumen to prevent encroachment on the intestinal epithelium,
shuttling bound microbes to secondary lymphoid tissues, and directly modulating microbial metabolic activity.
Aside from the “natural” polyreactive IgA detectable in germ-free mice, sIgA is predominantly gut colonization
dependent. The identification of immunogenic commensal bacteria and their specific IgA epitopes have further
elucidated our understanding of the mechanisms governing gastrointestinal balance and how dysbiosis can drive
intestinal pathologies. Meanwhile, the potential involvement of the fungal component of the gut microbiota
(mycobiota) in these processes is largely unknown. Only recently have intestinal fungi been recognized as a
factor contributing to events associated with inflammatory disease or response to therapy prompting multiple
questions regarding the development of antifungal mucosal antibody responses, their specificity, and
mechanisms of induction in the gut. In recent work, we have shown that polymorphisms in the Dectin-1 gene
(CLEC7A) or the fractalkine receptor gene CX3CR1 are associated with defects in antifungal immunity in
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients, and notably the latter leading to gut fungal overgrowth and
substantial decrease of antifungal antibodies. In preliminary studies we unexpectedly identified a broad range of
fungal organisms that were targeted by sIgA antibodies. Hyphal formation is a primary mechanism used by many
dimorphic fungi to invade and survive within their hosts. Notably we found that mycobiota aggravated intestinal
damage and inflammation is dependent upon hyphae-produced virulence factors that are targets of sIgA. These
preliminary data support the overall hypothesis that antifungal sIgA antibody responses are naturally induced by
specific gut mycobiota species and act against fungi-produced factors to play a key role in mucosal immunity by
averting direct contact of fungi with the intestinal epithelium to prevent intestinal barrier damage and related gut
inflammation. We will investigate this hypothesis both in vitro and in in vivo models, aided by deep sequencing
and computational platforms, and genetically modified fungal strains. We will determine IgA-reactive gut
mycobiota and fungal morphotypes involved in the induction of antifungal sIgA antibodies and will make use of
several model systems to define the functional role of antifungal sIgA in gut."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with
metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune and other diseases. These variants have the potential to reveal
molecular mechanisms that underpin human diseases, but their interpretation is extremely challenging, because
most are within non-coding genomic regions with unknown function. The long-term goal of the proposed research
is to elucidate the molecular basis of complex diseases by assembling comprehensive catalogs of regulatory
sequences and illuminating how non-coding genetic variants affect gene regulation. This proposal will leverage
the power of high-throughput genomic perturbations and computational analyses to discover regulatory
sequences, interpret non-coding genetic variants, and connect disease-associated variants to the genes they
regulate. Research Focus 1 will systematically discover novel regulatory sequences using CRISPR-directed
tiling deletion screens, which can discover regulatory sequences that are invisible to other approaches. These
screens will be performed in primary T cells and applied to megabase-scale regions surrounding T cell
differentiation genes, which are rich in uncharacterized GWAS hits. To determine how frequently GWAS hits
affect novel regulatory sequences lacking canonical enhancer marks, fine-mapped GWAS variants will be
intersected with regulatory sequences discovered by the screens. The function of novel regulatory sequences
will be determined with deletions followed by experiments to measure 3D chromatin contacts, gene expression,
and cellular proliferation. Research Focus 2 will utilize single-cell genome perturbations to connect thousands
of variants associated with human diseases to the genes they regulate across multiple cell types. Sequences
containing potentially causal GWAS variants will be targeted with CRISPR interference and gene expression will
be measured with single-cell RNA-seq in a mixture of disease-relevant immune cells. Using the single-cell data,
perturbed sequences will be connected to changes in gene expression in specific cell types. Variants predicted
to regulate gene expression will be validated by modifying alleles with genome editing. The expected outcomes
of this project are (i) systematic catalogs of regulatory sequences for genes involved in T cell differentiation, (ii)
molecular characterization of novel unmarked regulatory sequences that contain GWAS hits and (iii) connections
between sequences containing GWAS hits and genes that they regulate in specific cell types. This proposal will
establish genomic perturbations as a new strategy to interpret non-coding variants, uncover important new
regulatory biology, and accelerate mechanistic understanding of disease-associated variants."

Vertebrates repair skin injury through two fundamental biological processes: scar formation and tissue
regeneration. Human skin generally heals with scar formation, which may cause severe emotional distress and
physical disability. One hundred million new scars appear annually in the US, and although many products are
marketed for scar prevention, their results are modest. Consequently, the elucidation of mechanisms
underlying scar formation and tissue regeneration may result in new insights with far reaching implications in
the development of therapeutics that promotes skin regeneration after wounding. Ear hole closure and wound-
induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) are two instances where adult mammals can regenerate full-thickness skin
wounds without scar formation, including hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Using both models, we
demonstrated that topical pharmacologic activation of transient receptor protein A1 (TRPA1), a receptor
expressed on skin sensory nerves promotes regeneration. This improved healing depends on dermal dendritic
cells activating γδ Τ cells through interleukin 23. Strikingly, local activation of TRPA1 promotes tissue
regeneration in distant injured areas, suggesting that a circulating factor may be induced with an
accompanying paracrine mechanism. Our results reveal a new cutaneous neuroimmune-regeneration
pathway, and a fundamental advance for the field would be a more comprehensive molecular understanding of
signaling pathways involving multiple cell types that promotes mammalian tissue regeneration. In Aim 1, we
use a combination of optogenetics, mouse models, and single-cell genomics to investigate whether TRPA1 on
skin sensory nerves is necessary and sufficient to promote tissue regeneration in our two wounding models
and to identify the molecular mechanisms of how TRPA1 expressing neurons locally activate immune cells. In
Aim 2, we use mouse models to elucidate how γδ T cells and their effector cytokines promote systemic
scarless tissue regeneration in our two wounding models. Together, our aims define mechanisms of cellular
cross talk between nerves, immune cells, and skin, and successful completion will contribute to our overall goal
of developing novel therapies to promote scarless skin regeneration in humans."

This is an application to the K43 Fogarty Emerging Global Leader Award for Oscar Flores-Flores, MD, MSc.
Dr. Flores-Flores has shown great promise as a young investigator and has experience conducting research in
the epidemiology of aging and chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, he is
now proposing to gain expertise in implementation science and requires additional training and mentorship to
do so. His overall career goal is to become an independent investigator in the implementation of evidence-
based mental health care interventions for older adults, and this award will provide Dr. Flores-Flores with the
support and training to accomplish this goal. He has assembled an experienced mentorship team including:
Dr. Jose Parodi [Primary LMIC Mentor, geriatrics & public health, Associate Professor (USMP)]; Prof. Joseph
Gallo [Primary U.S Mentor, mixed methods research, Professor (JHSPH)]; Prof. Marina Piazza [Co- Mentor,

practical experience and key coursework, Dr. Flores-Flores proposes to accomplish the following training
goals: 1) training in implementation science; 2) training in experimental study designs; and 3) advanced
training in mixed-methods research; 2)
 Depression and anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent in older adults, and often present together.
Evidence-based care exists to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in older age. Trans-diagnostic
approaches such as problem-solving therapy (PST) have been shown to be effective and have been
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, there are myriad barriers to accessing
mental health care in older adults. Thus, interventions that systematically and effectively target those barriers
are urgently needed. Dr. Flores-Flores proposes to adapt, test, and refine a multi-faceted intervention strategy
to deliver mental health care to older adults in low resource settings in Lima, Peru. He proposed to determine
whether delivering mental health care via community health workers will have high uptake and will improve
symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults. Results from this study will generate preliminary data to
compete for an R01-level award to conduct a large cluster implementation-effectiveness trial in multiple
communities and determine the effect of the intervention on depressive/anxiety symptoms and other health-
related outcomes."

Compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans have a more than 2-fold higher incidence of multiple
myeloma (MM) and its asymptomatic precursor condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS). However, the etiological factors underlying these racial disparities are not known and few
epidemiologic resources are currently available to support research in diverse populations. Notably, there is
little evidence that genetic factors explain these disparities; differences in prevalence of MGUS and MM by
race may thus reflect external lifestyle and social factors. We posit that racial disparities are reflected in
socioeconomic status (SES) and geospatial factors such as the “health” of the environment in which one lives
(termed “built environment”), both of which are known to be linked to race and a variety of health outcomes.
The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) and the California Teachers Study (CTS), well-established
complementary cohorts of women, provide a unique opportunity to study SES and built environment factors for
MGUS in African American and non-Hispanic white women with up to 25 years of individual-level risk factor
information, assessed through repeated health questionnaires, available as well as geocoded residential
addresses. We propose an epidemiologic study pooling data from these two cohorts to evaluate the role of
individual and neighborhood SES and the built environment in racial disparities in MGUS. Prevalent cases of
MGUS will be identified by screening 8,000 cohort participants (3,300 in BWHS and 4,700 in CTS) with
archived blood specimens using gold-standard laboratory assays for the diagnosis of MGUS; we expect to
identify 660 cases of MGUS (including 330 African American and 330 non-Hispanic white women). We
hypothesize that neighborhood disadvantage and attributes of the built environment that inhibit healthy
behaviors increase risk and contribute to known racial disparities in MGUS. We will determine associations of
neighborhood deprivation and markers of individual SES, such as educational achievement, parental education
level, income, and early life financial instability, in relation to MGUS overall and by race. We will also explore
how characteristics of the built environment, such as urbanicity and neighborhood walkability, and the cross-
classification of these variables with SES, are associated with MGUS and may explain observed differences in
prevalence by race. Our proposed study is particularly innovative because it moves beyond the traditional,
single-level predictor model to an approach that addresses the complexity of both individual- and contextual-
level predictors for disease. The wide geographic/rural-urban, racial, and socioeconomic diversity of our study
population across cohorts makes it an ideal setting in which to interrogate the intersection between race, SES,
and neighborhood attributes on MGUS and MM risk. This research therefore has great potential to advance
current knowledge about MGUS etiology, to inform opportunities for risk reduction in high-risk understudied
populations, and to close the gap in racial disparities in multiple myeloma and its precursor conditions."

Tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, including colorectal cancer
(CRC). Many tumor-associated mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins not only lose the tumor suppressive function
of wild-type p53, but also gain new oncogenic activities to promote tumorigenesis, which is defined as the
“gain-of-function” (GOF). Mutp53 proteins often become stable and accumulate to very high levels in
cancer, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. Destabilizing mutp53 protein is being actively
tested as a novel and promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, the mechanism of mutp53
accumulation in cancer is poorly understood, which hinders the development of effective strategies for
cancer therapy. MDM2 is the most critical negative regulator of p53. MDM2 isoform B (MDM2B), a spliced
isoform of MDM2, is frequently overexpressed in human cancer, and plays an important role in
tumorigenesis. Currently, the mechanisms underlying MDM2B-mediated mutp53 accumulation and
MDM2B overexpression in cancer are poorly understood. Identifying their underlying mechanisms has the
direct potential to develop effective strategies to treat cancers carrying mutp53. The goal of this study is to
determine the mechanism of mutp53 accumulation in CRC to provide novel therapeutic targets/strategies
for CRC carrying mutp53. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that MDM2B overexpression
is a critical mechanism underlying mutp53 protein accumulation and GOF in CRC, and furthermore,
MDM2B and its signaling pathway can be targeted for therapy in CRC carrying mutp53. We will test our
hypothesis by following specific aims: 1) determine whether MDM2B overexpression is a critical mechanism
underlying mutp53 accumulation and GOF in CRC using different mouse colorectal tumor models, and
identify mechanisms underlying MDM2B-mediated mutp53 accumulation; and 2) identify mechanisms
underlying MDM2B overexpression in CRC, and test whether targeting MDM2B and its signaling pathway
can inhibit mutp53 accumulation and GOF in CRC. We anticipate that this proposed study will provide new
paradigms regarding mutp53 accumulation, tumor-promoting function of MDM2B, and MDM2B
overexpression in CRC. If accomplished successfully, results from this study will have potential to develop
MDM2B and its signaling pathway as novel therapeutic targets for CRC carrying mutp53."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring interstitial lung disease (ILD) that affects mainly
older adults for which there remains a significant unmet therapeutic need. While the pathophysiologic
underpinnings of IPF remain incompletely understood, an additional critical barrier to developing better
therapeutic outcomes for IPF has been a dearth of translationally relevant preclinical models. Based on a recent
paradigm shift wherein the concepts of repetitive injury to a dysfunctional, vulnerable, alveolar epithelium coupled
with an abnormal wound healing response are postulated as disease “drivers”, new opportunities are emerging
for therapeutic discovery in IPF. Over 60 mutations in the alveolar type 2 cell (AT2) restricted, Surfactant Protein
C [SP-C] gene [SFTPC], have been found in sporadic and familial IPF and provide important clues for
understanding IPF pathogenesis. To address the unmet need for veterans with IPF, this proposal builds upon
on a strong foundation of our prior work funded by this Merit Review program characterizing the cell biology of
SP-C biosynthesis that culminated in generation of two novel knock-in mouse models of spontaneous lung
fibrosis already in hand which express clinical SP-C mutants in AT2 cells in an allelic and inducible fashion. Our
Published Data has demonstrated that clinical, IPF-associated SFTPC mutations produce aberrant SP-C
proprotein isoforms that functionally segregate into 2 AT2 cell stress phenotypes: ER stress induced by
intracellular SP-C misfolding (“BRICHOS”) or impaired autophagy/mitophagy secondary to proSP-C
mistrafficking to non-native organelles (“Non-BRICHOS”). When expressed in the lung epithelium in vivo, both
the non-BRICHOS mutant (SftpcI73T) and the BRICHOS mutant (SftpcC121G) are extremely toxic to the lung and
each is sufficient to evoke a time-dependent, physiologically restrictive peripheral fibrotic lung phenotype that
elaborates translationally relevant biomarkers reported in human IPF. Building on this, our Merit Review renewal
will now leverage these Sftpc mutant mice to map distal lung cell populations in IPF while also identifying and
translating molecular mechanisms linking the disrupted cellular quality control, epithelial dysfunction, and
pathophysiology of IPF/ILDs. In 3 specific aims, our experimental approach will be to exploit the unique features
of these genetic models combined with tools and reagents available in our program designed to interogate cell
quality control and integrated stress responses to first define key alveolar niche cell populations emerging during
initiation, injury amplification, and fibrosis stages induced by SP-C mutations in vivo [Specific Aim 1]. Then
armed with this functional map we will couple Sftpc mice with reductionist models such as AT2 organoids to
define the role of endogenous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in AT2 dysfunction and the aberrant
injury/repair pathways found in IPF [Specific Aim 2]. Finally, we will assess the downstream consequences of
disrupted epithelial cell quality control for AT2 metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dynamics and then
contextualize their impact on AT2 phenotypes and fibrotic remodeling [Specific Aim 3]. As alveolar epithelial
dysfunction has not been studied extensively in vivo in the setting of fibrotic lung diseases, this approach offers
the unique opportunity to comprehensively identify unique mechanisms mediating responses to the mutant
SFTPC substrate by AT2 cells, and to assess the pathways promoting crosstalk between AT2 cells, inflammatory
cells and fibroblasts that drive parenchymal remodeling. By understanding the path to epithelial injury from
mutant SP-C, the mechanisms identified using these models can be cross-purposed to better understand IPF
pathogenesis in general, promote identification of new target pathways, and test novel IPF therapies."

Mitochondria allow our cells to use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as a highly efficient way to generate
ATP. The inner membrane-embedded OXPHOS system enzymes are multimeric complexes composed of
proteins from two different genetic origins, namely the nuclear and the mitochondrial DNA. Nucleus-encoded
proteins are synthesized in cytoplasmic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria. The mitochondrion-
encoded proteins, usually catalytic core subunits of the complexes, are synthesized into distinct mitochondrial
ribosomes. Mutations affecting these processes lead to mitochondrial cardio- and encephalo-myopathies and
have been linked to neurodegeneration, metabolic disease, cancer, and aging.
 We have developed a scientific research program aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying the assembly of mitochondrial complexes of dual genetic origin. Our program includes in-depth
studies into the assembly of three sets of macromolecular structures. (i) Assembly of individual OXPHOs
enzymes, with an emphasis on the assembly of MRC complex IV or cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal
MRC enzyme. (ii) Assembly of MRC enzymes into supramolecular structures known as supercomplexes and
respirasomes. (iii) Assembly and function of the mitoribosome.
 In each case, we will pursue three general goals: (i) Define the assembly pathway/s and the order of
incorporation of components and prosthetic groups; (ii) Identify and characterize the assembly factors
involved, and (iii) Disclose regulatory assembly checkpoints, which detect damaged or abnormally folded
components, or coordinate synthesis or maturation of one component with its assembly into the complex.
Studies outlined in this proposal will involve yeast genetics, gene disruption in human cells using gene-editing
strategies, cryo-EM reconstruction of protein complexes and assembly intermediates, and mechanistic
biochemistry in yeast, human cell lines, isolated mitochondria and purified native and recombinant proteins to
gain insight into the role/s of OXPHOS complex, supercomplex and mitoribosome assembly factors. The
analysis of the principles of the biogenesis process and the activities of the assembly factors is of central
importance for our understanding of the molecular basis of human mitochondrial disorders.
 Uncovering the mechanisms through which assembly of cellular macrostructures takes place in
standard conditions and under stress remains one of the grand challenges of modern science from a biological
and a biomedical perspective. We anticipate that our program will continue contributing to close the gap in our
understanding of mitochondrial biogenesis in health and disease."

 Strained cyclic compounds are often used as key intermediates in the synthesis of bio-active drugs
and natural products through strain-releasing reactions such as ring-expansion and ring-opening
processes. While small ring ketones such as cyclobutanones have found widespread applicability in
these transformations, the analogous use of cyclopropanone derivatives as substrates has seriously
lagged behind, as these compounds have long been considered unsustainable synthetic intermediates
due to their extreme strain and kinetic instability. This work proposes the use of 1-sulfonylcyclopropanols
as a general class of stable cyclopropanone surrogates in organic synthesis, unlocking access to myriad
previously inaccessible synthetic disconnections via strain-releasing reactions. These include (1)
rearrangements initiated by the addition of nucleophiles, (2) transition metal-catalyzed C–C activation
and deconstruction strategies, and (3) application of cyclopropanone derivatives as 1,1-cyclopropyl
linchpins. We have already developed an efficient enantioselective route to these compounds and have
obtained significant preliminary data in each of these types of reactions, leading to a variety of chiral
synthons difficult to access by other methods. Both the electronic and steric nature of the sulfonyl moiety
in these surrogates, which is acting here as a base-labile protecting group and conferring crystallinity to
these compounds, is found to have a crucial impact on their rate of equilibration to cyclopropanone,
highlighting their tunable reactivity and the potential for their widespread applicability as synthetic
intermediates. During the funding period and using the mechanistic knowledge acquired, this technology
leading to enantioenriched 1-sulfonylcyclopropanols will be extended to the formation of 1-
sulfonylcyclopropylamine and hydrazines as modular precursors of chiral cyclopropanimines and
hydrazones, respectively, and will allow novel access to chiral amine-containing scaffolds as well as
strained chiral carbene equivalents. We firmly believe that the stability, ease of synthesis and modular
character of these reagents will serve as a general solution to harvest the untapped versatility of
cyclopropanones and its analogues as highly reactive building blocks in synthesis. Thus, this work will
significantly expand the scope of disconnections available to chemists in the realm of strained ring
activation and functionalization, evolving these severely strained derivatives from chemical curiosities to
versatile synthetic intermediates, greatly contributing to streamline the production of biologically relevant
organic molecules."

 There are 124 publications that establish 185 disease risk loci for the genetics of systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) with robust supporting data. This is a completely different situation than when AI0274717 started 33 years
ago as a search for genetic linkage. Now, in addition to the 185 risk loci we have strong circumstantial evidence
for an etiologic role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at the origin of SLE, especially considering the recently published
powerful association between the location in the genome of transcription complexes containing the Latency III
gene product, Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 2 (EBNA2) and the genetic risk loci of SLE. This association has
been confirmed and extended to the at present known SLE risk loci. In addition, new data show that EBNA3C
and EBNALP, both also EBV Latency III gene products, are also powerfully concentrated at the SLE risk loci, all
three, EBNA2, -3C, & -LP, clustering together and in aggregate binding indirectly to more than half the known
SLE risk loci. A set of human transcription factors and co-factors (TFs) tend to bind DNA at these same SLE risk
loci. Our hypothesis is that many genetic mechanisms that cause SLE operate in the EBV transformed B cell,
because of the EBV Latency III gene expression. Since ~90% of the plausibly causal variants in the 185 risk loci
are in genomic regions, predicted to have regulatory function; therefore, the role of TFs promises to be important
in the genetic mechanisms of SLE. What is missing, a serious gap in our knowledge, is the identify of the Target
genes regulated by these risk variants. Given the unexpected, but dominating influence of the Latency III gene
products in associations with the SLE risk loci, we conclude that the cell type in which to begin the systematic
search for the disease relevant Target genes is the EBV-infected and transformed B cell. In Aim 1 we will focus
on identifying Target genes in these cells for as many of the 185 SLE risk loci as possible with special attention
focused on the involvement of EBNA2. In Aim 2 we will concentrate on the allelic differences in Target gene
expression induced by the risk and non-risk alleles of SLE risk locus variants, again with special attention to the
possible role of EBNA2.
 We have preliminary data that support our technical capacity to perform the experiments proposed and have
constructed many of the reagents needed to perform the proposed experiments, which have been initiated. We
will adapt high throughput systems biology methods to screen and explore the gene regulation of the 185 loci to
build a foundation to evaluate the role EBNA2 has in SLE etiology relevant regulation. Extraordinary new
commercially available methods will make the screening procedures proposed practical, feasible and affordable.
If our hypothesis is correct and we demonstrate EBNA2-dependent mechanisms of gene regulation at the risk
loci, then these would be nominated as potential causal mechanisms for the genesis of SLE. These results will
lay the foundation for the important next step, to perturb the identified mechanism in ways that change the risk
of developing SLE or that change the capacity of the illness to persist."

The idea that information processing depends on neuronal firing rate (rate coding) has long been a central
dogma in neurobiology. However, other non-canonical coding schemes (temporal and “analog” codes) have
been proposed to carry meaningful information and be more computationally powerful than rate coding.
Importantly, the field has lacked powerful genetic model systems to disentangle non-canonical coding processes,
and I addressed this gap by defining two neural circuits in Drosophila that can be used to study temporal and
analog codes. I found that temporal coding underlies the circadian regulation of sleep in the Drosophila
DN1p clock neurons, whereas analog and potentially “hybrid” (analog + spiking) codes are used to
achieve axon-specific hunger processing in Drosophila DA-WED feeding neurons.
 As a model system to understand how spiking temporal codes impact molecular signaling and behavior, we
will focus on Drosophila DN1p clock neurons having specific spiking patterns to control sleep quality through a
novel form of synaptic plasticity, SPDP (Spike Pattern Dependent Plasticity). To examine the molecular process
of SPDP formation, we will first characterize essential elements of the temporal structures within irregular spiking
patterns in DN1ps, as well as identify their biophysical origins. Next, we will investigate molecular mechanisms
that act downstream of presynaptic spiking patterns to transform electrical signals into biochemical responses.
We will also leverage the power of Drosophila genetics to delineate the entire molecular pathway required for
SPDP in DN1ps synapses.
 As a model system to understand how nonspiking neuronal codes impact signaling and behavior, we will
focus on Drosophila DA-WED feeding neurons having local plasticity to control protein hunger behavior. Neural
coding paradigms have generally focused on “digital” all-or-none spike-based models. In mammals, pure
“analog” coding occurs in the retina, but recent work has shown that analog signaling modulates spike-based
signaling (“hybrid” coding) in the hippocampus and cortex. However, the function of these codes in neural
plasticity and behavior remains unclear. We recently discovered that the “protein coding” axonal branch, but not
the “sugar coding” axonal branch, exhibits sub-threshold membrane potential fluctuations of DA-WED feeding
neurons, following mild protein deprivation. Following severe protein deprivation, such analog signaling interacts
with spiking events to generate “hybrid” processing to achieve stronger and longer-lasting protein feeding
behavior. Thus, we will study the molecular processes mediating “analog” and “hybrid” signaling and how
“hybrid” codes may underlie localized branch-specific plasticity. In conclusion, these studies using Drosophila
DN1p clock neurons and DA-WED feeding neurons should elucidate fundamental principles for non-canonical
neural codes, determine the role of these neural codes in long-lasting behaviors and plasticity, and identify their
underlying molecular mechanisms."

Fatty liver (steatosis), characterized by an accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes, is one of the earliest pathological
changes in the progression of alcohol-associated fatty liver disease (AFLD). Pathophysiological mechanisms
involved during development of AFLD are complex and multifactorial, including gut, pancreas and adipose tissue
dysfunctions that reportedly affect liver pathology. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the crosstalk
between these organs are regulated by peptide hormones. Especially relevant to this proposal is the growing
interest in understanding the role of gut hormones in organ interactions and in the development of AFLD.
Among all the gastrointestinal hormones, the stomach-derived ghrelin is the one of the hormones that
significantly increases with chronic alcohol exposure in humans and experimental animal models. In our recent
studies, we demonstrated that an alcohol-induced increase in serum ghrelin levels impairs insulin secretion from
pancreatic β-cells. The consequent reduction in the circulating insulin levels promotes adipose lipolysis and
mobilization of fatty acids to the liver to ultimately contribute to hepatic steatosis. Concomitantly, chronic alcohol
treatment to rats increases serum levels of the gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) while decreasing
liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP-2) and adiponectin levels. Interestingly, these pathological
changes were not altered in ethanol-fed ghrelin receptor knockout (GHS-R KO) rats, which were also resistant
to steatosis development. Collectively, these results indicate a fundamental role of an alcohol-induced ghrelin
increase in affecting multiple organs, such as the gut and adipose to modulate GLP-1, insulin, adiponectin and
LEAP-2 activity/levels, to ultimately lead to the development of AFLD.
To study these effects, we present the following hypothesis: Alcohol-induced increase in serum ghrelin levels
directly (i) inhibits GLP-1 hormone-mediated energy metabolism in hepatocytes and (ii) modulates
adipose metabolism to increase adipose lipolysis and decrease adiponectin secretion, both of which
contribute to hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, ghrelin also enhances its effects by lowering the levels of
LEAP-2, recently discovered endogenous ghrelin antagonist peptide that reduces the ghrelin receptor
(GHS-R) mediated signal transduction.
We will utilize a variety of state-of-the art technologies and innovative biological concepts to explore our
hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) Characterize the role of ghrelin in modulating the gut-derived GLP-1
hormone-mediated gut-liver crosstalk during the development of AFLD; 2) Characterize the specific contribution
of ghrelin in modulating the adipose-liver axis in the development of ALFD; and 3) Examine the effect of alcohol-
induced ghrelin increase on LEAP-2 expression and characterize its role in modulating hepatic steatosis.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will aid mechanistic insights into understanding ghrelin’s role in
modulating the gut, adipose and liver axis to promote the development of alcoholic steatosis."
10854949,"Project Summary. Discovering new antibiotics for Gram-negative bacteria is uniquely challenging, due to their
double-membrane structure that acts as a permeability barrier to drugs and as an anchor for efflux pumps. Efforts
that target one membrane protein or one efflux pump at a time are ineffective, due to rapid rise of resistance
mutations. We will target the TrmD-catalyzed m1G37 methylation of tRNA to inhibit biosynthesis of multiple
classes of membrane proteins, with the potential to accelerate bactericidal action. TrmD is a bacteria-specific S-
adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyl transferase that controls accuracy of the protein-synthesis
reading frame. Loss of TrmD increases +1 frameshifting and causes cell death. We have shown that genes for
multiple membrane proteins and efflux pumps in E. coli and in other Gram-negative bacteria contain TrmD-
dependent codons near the start of the reading frame. We hypothesize that targeting TrmD will reduce protein
synthesis of all of these genes, thus offering a novel solution to an unmet need. While AstraZeneca (AZ), GSK,
and academic labs have attempted to target TrmD by screening small molecular compound libraries, isolated
hits lack the cell-permeability needed to exhibit an antibacterial effect. Here, we propose to screen a large
collection of microbial extracts and fractions for cell-permeable and TrmD-targeting natural products (NPs) that
are potent and selective over the human counterpart Trm5. We will use a cell-based assay, consisting of a 1:1
mix of an E. coli (Ec) TrmDmCh strain (dependent on trmD for survival and expressing mCh (mCherry) as a
fluorescence marker) and an Ec Trm5YFP strain (dependent on trm5 for survival and expressing YFP), in a high-
throughput screening (HTS) campaign to isolate NPs that selectively inhibit the TrmDmCh strain. We perform this
assay in Ec tolC+ cells, which maintain the entire Gram-negative efflux machinery including the major efflux
pump encoded by tolC, to screen for NPs that are cell-permeable and resistant to efflux. A pilot screen with this
tolC+ cell-based assay has identified an attractive hit, demonstrating the HTS-readiness of the assay. In Aim 1,
we will use this tolC+ cell-based assay to screen 74,770 actinobacterial extracts and fractions available at The
Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). We will assess hits in secondary assays, remove false positives, evaluate
their activity at the whole-cell level, and test them for permeability and efflux in a panel of Gram-negative bacteria.
In Aim 2, we will de-replicate the top 20 hits to isolate the active NPs, determine their structures, and use a
combination of genome sequencing and mining to identify their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for developing
biotechnology platforms to scale up their production. In Aim 3, we will test active NPs for conferring TrmD-
deficient phenotypes in whole-cell assays, determine their potency, selectivity, mechanism of action, and assess
their risk of resistance. These NPs represent novel leads in a new paradigm of antibiotic discovery that addresses
the multi-drug resistance problem of Gram-negative bacteria."
10862701,"Abstract
Recovery from severe forms of inflammatory vascular injury, such as acute lung injury (ALI), depends on the
lung's capacity to rapidly activate tissue repair pathways. Macrophages (Mφ), the most abundant sentinel
immune cell type in the lung, are required for restoration of tissue-fluid homeostasis following injury, but the
identity of the reparative Mφ subpopulations and how they are generated remain elusive. Here, we have
discovered a subset of the alveolar Mφ (AMφ) population that is required to maintain lung fluid homeostasis
basally and induce tissue repair after injury. Our Supporting Data show that: 1) loss of cAMP Response
Element Binding (CREB) protein expression in myeloid cells (Creb∆LyzM mice) arrest a subpopulation of the AMφ
lineage at the pre-AMφ stage, leading to decreased AMφ generation and increased lung vascular permeability
basally; 2) Creb∆LyzM mice failed to resolve injury post-LPS challenge and died more rapidly after Pseudomonas
aeruginosa infection; 3) transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (ATACseq) of
flow-sorted CREB-null AMφ have markedly altered gene expression and chromatin remodeling; and 4) CREB is
required to inhibit excessive production of nuclear acetyl-CoA from the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)
through synthesis of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Based on these provocative Preliminary Data,
in Aim#1, we will test the hypothesis that CREB transcriptionally promotes differentiation of this barrier
reparative AMφ subpopulation. In Aim#2, we will investigate that CREB regulates reparative AMφ generation
by controlling epigenetic modifications of histones thereby leading to AMφ gene transcription. Here, we will
address the novel concept that the transcriptional activity of CREB is required to upregulate PDK4 expression,
which in turn prevents transport of its target, PDC, from mitochondria to the nucleus thereby suppressing
excessive nuclear acetyl Co-A generation and limiting epigenetic modifications of histones, leading to gene
transcription that induces the barrier reparative AMφ population. These studies will employ a rigorous multi-
omics approach (single-cell RNA-, ATAC-and Chip-sequencing) and functional assays in genetically altered mice
including Rosa-CrebCxcxr3-ERT mice (in which CREB is conditionally deleted in monocytes/interstitial macrophages)
to define the role of CREB transcriptional activity in generating the reparative AMφ population. Understanding
how this barrier reparative AMɸ subset is generated should make it possible to enhance differentiation of this
subset during injury by pharmacological or genetic means, thereby reducing the mortality of ALI and related
conditions."
10844605,"Project Summary/Abstract
Trauma and Surgical Sepsis are among the leading causes of morbidity and death worldwide. Both of these acute
insults can lead to immune dysfunction that then contributes to a state of persistent critical illness. This immune
dysfunction is manifested by an excessive systemic inflammatory response that can lead to organ dysfunction;
and a simultaneous suppression of immune defenses that renders patients susceptible to secondary infections.
However, we lack a comprehensive and integrated view of how humans respond to severe injury, and more
importantly, how these responses differ between patients that recover quickly vs. those that die and/or
development persistent critical illness. Advances in single cell multiomics and blood analysis using multi-
platform, multiomics now makes it possible to characterize changes across a broad range of cell states and
patterns within the circulating biomolecule landscape to great depth. In the previous funding cycle, we were
the first to perform single cell genomics and large-scale multi-platform, multiomics on blood samples from
severely injured patients. This published work identified many novel findings, including the early massive
release of cellular constituents into the circulation of trauma patients that follow a complicated course or die.
In addition, open chromatin analysis of PBMC found that patients who remain critically ill also have global
epigenetic changes evident early across immune cell types, representing de-repression of polycomb targets. In
one line of research, we will reverse translate the these and other novel findings from our initial human
multiomic analyses into our mouse model of hemorrhagic shock and trauma to pursue potential therapeutic
targets. In another line of research, we will extend our analysis of multiomic data to create a Blood Atlas of the
human trauma response. This online resource will incorporate data on the range of circulating immune cell
states commonly seen after severe injury and integrate these with the longitudinal changes in high dimensional
datasets of circulating proteins, lipids and other metabolites. We will apply state-of-the-art computational
strategies to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets with patients stratified by outcomes, treatments, age
and sex. We will compare our results with similar published studies in sepsis. In addition to the discoveries and
mechanistic insights our analysis will yield, we hope that the resources we provide will stimulate comparative
studies and further analyses of our datasets."
10765693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our team has developed a strategy that samples materials on surfaces of removed orthopedic implants using
sonication and shown that the derived biofilm-sampling “sonicate fluids” have the highest yield of any specimen
type for microbial detection and can furthermore be used to assess host response at implant surfaces. While
assessment of host response has been clinically leveraged to differentiate infected from non-infected orthopedic
implants, host-based approaches deployed to date have been simplistic, detecting alpha-defensin or profiling
neutrophil numbers, for example, with none defining the microbiology of infected arthroplasties or underlying
etiologies of non-infectious arthroplasty failure. We hypothesize that, beyond differentiating infectious from
non-infectious arthroplasty failure, capturing host response in sonicate fluid using a proteomic
approach will discern microbial etiologies of periprosthetic joint infection and individual causes of non-
infectious arthroplasty failure. Given that detection of causative organisms in periprosthetic joint infection and
definition individual causes of non-infectious arthroplasty failure, needed to direct management, are not
universally realized with extant diagnostic approaches, this will be clinically useful.
We propose the first-ever global, unbiased proteomic analysis of sonicate fluid, assessing in vivo human immune
response to infectious compared to non-infectious arthroplasty failure and subsets thereof. We further propose
an unbiased global analysis of microbial proteins in sonicate fluid in periprosthetic joint infection. Sonicate fluid
has been shown in preliminary work to be suitable for the proposed proteomic analyses. Sonicate fluid from
failed total knee arthroplasties will be studied using the new technology of liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry to determine whether host proteomic analysis can differentiate Staphylococcus aureus,
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae
periprosthetic joint infection, and non-infectious arthroplasty failure subsets of aseptic loosening, periprosthetic
fracture, instability, and osteolysis/adverse tissue reaction. In addition to mass spectrometry, a complementary
next generation sequencing-based proximity extension assay approach that measures levels of 3,072
cytokines and other host proteins will be used to measure low abundance human proteins missed using
mass spectrometry alone, allowing examination of host response in even greater detail. Finally, microbial
proteomic analysis of sonicate fluid from patients with periprosthetic joint infection will be performed, to determine
whether microbial proteomic analysis can differentiate S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, E. faecalis and
S. agalactiae infections."
10849922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My group develops and uses chemical and biochemical tools to investigate the structure and function of
noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) and their complexes with proteins (RNPs) and small molecules (smRNAs). In the
context of this project, we will specifically focus on two general areas: 1) engineering fragment antigen binding
(Fabs) as chaperones for RNA/RNP/smRNA crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) and as enabling
tools for RNA biology, and 2) elaborating mechanisms of RNA function, especially catalytic RNAs (ribozymes).
The terrestrial transcriptome contains vast numbers of structured RNAs within both coding and noncoding
transcripts that act alone and in concert with proteins to carry out critically important roles in nearly every facet
of cellular function. Understanding how these RNAs mediate biological function in health and disease requires
knowledge of their three-dimensional architectures. We will deploy a variety of structural biology, biophysical,
biochemical, computational and chemical approaches, including kinetic isotope effect analysis and the use of
nucleotides from an artificially expanded genetic system. The data that emerge from our recombinant Fab work
will engender a robust platform to generate Fabs that bind structured RNA with high affinity and specificity,
establish Fabs as powerful reagents in structural and mechanistic RNA biology and yield new macromolecular
structures, which have profound impact on our understanding of the underlying biology and serve as a framework
to develop and test functional hypotheses. In addition, our in-depth work on catalytic RNA will define for the first
time the relationship between catalytic structure and transition state structure, a missing link that has plagued
efforts to engineer macromoleclules with novel catalytic functions. Beyond the conceptual advances that emerge,
this work promises to deliver to the RNA community powerful Fab reagents for RNA/RNP structural and
functional studies, nucleotide analogs to support novel approaches to define RNA catalytic mechanisms, and
strategies to render large RNAs more tractable by increasing the density of information."
10830246,"ABSTRACT
The neocortex is the most complex cellular system in the natural world, the seat of motor, sensory and
executive function. While many of the mechanisms responsible for neocortical formation are known, key
aspects of how gene expression and cellular behavior lead to species-specific features of the neocortex remain
to be discovered. Recent advances in genomic analysis and in vivo cellular labeling enable study of cortical
development at an unprecedented level of resolution. In particular, some human-specific genes and neural
precursor cells have been detected and current evidence suggests that increased proliferative capacity and
longer neurogenesis times enable the expanded growth of the primate neocortex. In this project using
archived tissue, we will comprehensively compare the heterogeneous groups of neural precursor cells in
mouse, macaque, chimpanzee and human neocortex. Using single cell and single nucleus RNA sequencing
and implementation of novel molecular labeling tools, we will compare genomic signatures and in vivo behavior
of these cells to uncover mechanisms of brain growth and evolution. A significant focus of this project will be
on a precursor type called the basal radial glial cell (bRGC), thought to have emerged recently in evolution to
enable expansion of the primate brain. However, our preliminary experiments uncover multiple groups of
bRGCs in mouse neocortex that share key features of bRGCs found in primate brain, contradicting reports
suggesting their biased role in primate brain growth. These studies will use emerging evidence and new tools
to elucidate species-specific programs controlling neocortical growth."
10814155,"Project Summary
The prevalence of heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction (MI), in pregnancy has increased over the
past decades due in part to rising maternal age and lifestyle changes. MI during late pregnancy carries a worse
prognosis than in non-pregnant (NP) women for unclear reasons. The late-pregnant (LP) rodent is more prone
to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) compared to the NP rodent. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production in the heart is higher in LP mice subjected to IRI. However, the underlying molecular
mechanisms involved in the higher susceptibility of late pregnancy to IRI are not clear. MicroRNAs (miRs) have
emerged as a powerful novel regulator of gene expression. In the heart, several miRs have been involved in IRI,
suggesting that regulation of their function could be used as a novel cardioprotective strategy. MicroRNA
microarray analysis showed that the expression of microRNA-98-5p (miR98) was highly increased in the LP
heart compared to the NP heart at baseline. Strikingly, miR98 was increased further in the LP heart compared
to the NP heart when subjected to IRI. These miR98 expression dynamics may underlie the higher vulnerability
and predisposition of the LP heart to IRI. miR98 is also significantly increased in the plasma of pregnant women
at high risk of cardiovascular disease compared to healthy pregnant patients and healthy non-pregnant patients
in the reproductive age. In vitro data shows that the expression of miR98 is increased in female cardiomyocytes
subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation, which mimics IRI. Knockdown of miR98 reduces apoptosis, ROS
production, and inflammatory markers in female cardiomyocytes subjected to H/R. To investigate the mechanism
of action of miR98, TargetScan software was used to predict miR98 targets. STAT3 and PGC-1α were strongly
predicted as miR98 targets. STAT3 and PGC-1α are known negative regulators of reactive oxygen species
production and their deletion in cardiomyocytes in vivo has been shown to predispose mice to peripartum
cardiomyopathy. Expression of STAT3 and PGC-1α are lower in the LP rat hearts subjected to I/R injury
compared to the NP rat hearts subjected to I/R injury. Furthermore, knockdown of miR98 in vitro increases
STAT3 and PGC-1α protein expression, whereas miR98 overexpression reduces their expression, suggesting
they could be targets of miR98. The hypotheses of this proposal are, i) induction of miR98 in LP leads to higher
cardiac vulnerability to IRI via targeting STAT3 and PGC-1α, leading to increased cardiomyocyte death, ROS
production, and inflammation, and ii) miR98 has the potential to be served as a therapeutic modality and as a
biomarker for early prediction of cardiovascular disease in pregnancy."
10833481,"Project Summary/Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders in the United
States. Further, Latinos in the US represent one of the fastest growing ethnic groups and report the second
highest rates of depression, making their growing presence in neighborhoods and their well-being relevant to
the overall success of the nation. Yet the effects of neighborhood-level factors on depression, particularly in
Latinos, remains understudied. There exists a paucity of research that examines the effect of residential
segregation on mental health. Fewer still has assessed causal pathways— including through neighborhood
features such as neighborhood social cohesion (NSC) and neighborhood problems (NP)—using rigorous
quantitative methodologies. Additionally, NSC is of particular interest due to the potential mental health
benefits it may have. However, the literature examining for what subgroup of Latinos NSC is most helpful for
depression and what the spatial relationship may be is limited. In an effort to address these gaps, I will
examine 1) The direct and indirect effect of residential segregation on depressive symptoms at two time points
in Latinos through individual-level NSC and NP, 2) The cross-sectional direct and indirect effect of residential
segregation on depressive symptoms in Latinos through neighborhood-level NSC and NP, 3) Effect
modification of the association between individual level NSC on depressive symptoms by language proficiency
while accounting for neighborhood differences, and Exploratory) To explore the spatial relationship between
individual-level NSC and depressive symptoms in Latinos. Method & Analysis: This dissertation study will
employ multilevel models in order to account for clustering in two population-based datasets: the Latino sample
in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and its ancillary Neighborhood Study (Aim 1,2) and the Hispanic
Community Health Survey/Study of Latinos and its Sociocultural Ancillary Study (Aim 3). In order to address
gaps in the literature I will 1) carryout a mediation analysis using a multilevel model across two time points
(2003, 2010) to examine the direct and indirect effects of residential segregation on depressive symptoms
through individual-level NSC and NP (AIM 1). To address same source bias in using individual-level NSC and
NP as mediators, a cross-sectional (2010) multilevel model will be used to examine the direct and indirect
effects of residential segregation on depressive symptoms using neighborhood-level measures of NSC and NP
(AIM 2). Multilevel models will also be employed to examine effect modification of the association between
NSC and depressive symptoms by language proficiency (AIM 3). Contributions: The 2-year training program
and dissertation proposed in this F-31 fellowship application will support me in developing skills and methods
in neighborhood effects research critical to the completion of my dissertation study and doctoral research
training. The fellowship will ultimately further my goal of becoming an independent research scientist that will
address mental health inequities through neighborhood effects research in minoritized populations."
10794908,"ABSTRACT
Perturbations in redox signaling are associated with multiple neurological disorders, ranging from
neurodegenerative diseases to brain tumors. The brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease and
improved understanding of its altered bioenergetics and redox status is likely to improve treatment options. GBM
is highly heterogeneous and includes cells that have altered redox states and similarities to neural stem cells,
called brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), that cause tumor recurrence. A redox regulator we identified as being
elevated in BTICs is GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1), a gene known to be altered in dopa-responsive dystonia and
Parkinson’s disease. Importantly, GCH1, a rate-limiting enzyme that produces tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4),
maintains BTIC survival via suppressing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitigating ROS via
GCH1 is one mechanism by which BTICs may survive hostile tumor microenvironments, like nutrient deprivation.
As redox biology and metabolism are closely linked, I hypothesize that the metabolic consequence of high GCH1
confers protection to oxidatively vulnerable lipids to support BTIC growth. My current findings during the F99
phase strongly suggest that the GCH1/BH4 pathway increases lipid utilization and plays a vital role in protecting
oxidatively vulnerable lipids during metabolic reprogramming. The successful investigation of oxidative stress
responses via GCH1 and its relationship with metabolism will reveal metabolic vulnerabilities for clinical
intervention. In addition, my studies are likely to be informative for other neurodegenerative diseases where
GCH1 is altered, or ROS is unregulated.
For the K99 phase, continued studies in brain tumor models will shift focus toward elucidating the impact of GBM
on the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in regulating immune suppression and myeloid recruitment.
Infiltrating BM cells are a significant contributor to the tumor microenvironment where GBM co-opts these cells
to drive disease progression. Brain tumors are excitatory cells that readily release/uptake neurotransmitters for
their growth, but this high neural activity has not been investigated in the BM, despite the BM being innervated.
BM cells have several neuroreceptors, suggesting these cells can readily respond to neural cues. As BM
innervation is important for its maintenance and immune mobilization, aberrant neural activity from GBM that
remodel the BM is unexplored. Therefore, using BM denervation studies in GBM models, I will assess neural
activity as a critical player in myeloid skewing in the BM and recruit immunosuppressive myeloid cells to the
brain. Elucidating the crosstalk between glioma-to-bone marrow through neural communication provides an
opportunity to disrupt signaling pharmacologically without having to consider drugs for blood brain barrier
penetrance."

Operating within the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC), the Small Animal Imaging &
Radiotherapy Facility (SAIRF) provides innovative, state-of-the-art, affordable, noninvasive, high-resolution, in-
vivo and ex-vivo imaging and radiotherapy support to UWCCC members who utilize small animal models in their
research. SAIRF experts provide guidance to investigators ensuring the experimental design is best suited to
address their cancer questions. Incorporating positron emission/computed tomography (PET/CT), single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound/photoacoustics
(US/PA), digital planar X-ray, and/or optical bioluminescence/fluorescence/near-infrared (NIR) imaging
modalities, SAIRF affords access to all major small animal imaging modalities. Additionally, SAIRF provides
radiotherapy support, offering x-ray irradiators for cell, whole body, and CT-guided radiation therapy, and
dedicated equipment to assay radioactive tissues/blood for biodistribution, pharmacology, and toxicology
applications. Moreover, UWCCC members can select their desired level of service ranging from radiotherapy
delivery/image acquisition and reconstruction, to interpretation, analysis, and/or figure preparation. In most
cases, proprietary agents are developed and produced in-house with collaborators and when necessary,
commercial agents (Tc-99m MDP, Lu-177 Lutathera, Ra-223 dichloride, etc) are acquired for imaging and
radionuclide therapy studies. SAIRF holds umbrella animal use, biosafety, and radiation safety protocols, thus
assuring appropriate regulatory control of imaging and radiotherapy studies while minimizing the regulatory
burden on individual investigators. SAIRF supports the preclinical development of new imaging and theranostic
agents intended for clinical translation. One such agent, NM404, initiated here and underwent extensive
preclinical evaluation within SAIRF prior to translating to clinical trials. During the current CCSG funding cycle,
SAIRF has provided critical imaging support to 79 unique UWCCC members across all six UWCCC programs.
We continue to assess new imaging, radiotherapy and related technologies and, if suitable and relevant to the
membership, develop a plan to bring such new technologies into SAIRF. Our specific aims are to provide: 1)
UWCCC members seamless access and guidance to the most advanced small animal cancer imaging and
radiotherapy technologies available, and 2) infrastructure and expertise for the preclinical discovery and
development of new molecular imaging and theranostic cancer agents. Funding provided from the CCSG
permits consultation, strategic planning, training, regulatory and quality oversight in support of our mission to
serve the UWCCC membership at the highest level while minimizing costs. We expect that our role in
development and evaluation of new imaging and therapy agents, especially those being developed by our own
membership, as well as assessment of new theranostic agents, will ultimately permit personalized treatment
planning and improve the quality of life and survival outcomes of cancer patients."
10873119,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cancer remains a leading cause of death and disability in the United States and significant disparities across
urban and rural, as well as racial and ethnic populations, exist. Population health sciences is an interdisciplinary
approach drawing on basic, clinical, and social sciences to ensure translation and dissemination of new
knowledge into useful applications across multiple sectors. The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin, SHOW, is a
long-standing infrastructure for population health research. Established in 2008, SHOW includes an ongoing
longitudinal cohort study of individuals representing the entire state of Wisconsin. As a University of Wisconsin
Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) shared resource (SR), SHOW provides members with an existing data
collection infrastructure and access to detailed survey data, physical exam measurements and biospecimens for
advancing cancer control. UWCCC has a rich history of providing survey and research study design support for
members through the Cancer Prevention and Outcomes Data (C-POD) SR; which was merged with SHOW to
support cancer research across the entire UWCCC catchment area. In the current CCSG cycle, the C-POD and
SHOW served 35 unique UWCCC members across all six scientific programs. SHOW includes detailed survey
and physical exam data describing population trends in numerous well established and emerging cancer risk
factors including multiple social determinants of health. These detailed data are coupled with stored
biospecimens including urine, serum, plasma and DNA on over 4,000 individual Wisconsin residents. With this
unique resource, SHOW’s goal is to facilitate innovative cancer research for improved cancer prevention and
control across all communities in Wisconsin. This is accomplished through 3 aims: 1) Accelerate Cancer
Surveillance and Cancer Prevention and Control Research through the Use of Existing Data. SHOW’s
longitudinal data are available to UWCCC members to conduct etiologic research and monitor the prevalence of
known and emerging cancer risk factors across the UWCCC catchment. 2) Facilitate the Development of New
Population Based Cancer Research Utilizing SHOW Expertise and Infrastructure. Independent of the core
SHOW data, SHOW can support new study design and survey development, including rigorous and reproducible
methods and protocols for population based biospecimen collection and storage. 3) Foster Use of SHOW
Biospecimens for Novel Cancer Research. SHOW maintains an extensive biorepository and expertise to support
cost effective biomarker based cancer research. Dr. Malecki (CPC), the SHOW Faculty Leader and Dr. Schultz,
the Facility Manager, have over twenty years of combined experience and expertise in population based
epidemiologic, community engaged, and translational research. SHOW also maintains long-standing
relationships with diverse African American and rural community based organizations serving those carrying the
heaviest cancer burden. These ongoing partnerships are critical for UWCCC members to disseminate findings,
to advance cancer control and reduce disparities in alignment with the UWCCC Strategic Plan."
10873122,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The mission of the Translational Science Biocore (TSB) is to facilitate cancer research by providing
comprehensive services that enable cellular and molecular characterization of animal models and human-
derived biospecimens. Aim 1 is to collect, annotate and distribute human-derived biospecimens. TSB operates
with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to collect, store, annotate and distribute a wide variety of human
tissues and body fluids that meet specified quality parameters. In the current Cancer Center Support Grant
(CCSG) cycle, we expanded our protocol to enhance patient consenting and improve access to tissue and linked
clinical data across multiple resources and repositories. TSB is authorized to serve as an ‘honest broker’ to
provide investigators with clinical annotations that are coded to protect patient confidentiality. TSB also provides
these services to UWCCC members with project-specific, IRB-approved protocols, such as investigator-initiated
as well as national clinical trials. Aim 2 is to construct and distribute disease-specific tissue microarrays (TMAs).
TSB pathologists review archival tissue blocks to identify specimens well suited for inclusion in each TMA which
is then constructed by TSB staff. In the current CCSG cycle, 57 new TMAs with annotated clinical data were
created, bringing the total to 115 which was facilitated by the purchase of an automated microarrayer funded by
an NIH S10 award (S10OD023526). Aim 3 is to provide high quality services, expertise, and infrastructure in
cellular, molecular, quantitative, and computational pathology. TSB pathologists and expert staff guide project
development, conduct experiments, and interpret data that utilize human- and/or animal model-derived
biospecimens. Our broad expertise and services span histopathology, morphometric analysis, quantitative
analyses of specific molecular phenotypes, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and cell line
authentication. TSB houses state-of-the-art instrumentation required for each of these services. During this
CCSG cycle, TSB upgraded its digital pathology whole slide scanner and purchased systems to expand spatial
and molecular profiling services. Impact on UWCCC: During the current CCSG cycle, TSB has supported the
research of 129 unique UWCCC program members across all six scientific programs and distributed over 4,800
biospecimens. These members held 431 cancer-relevant research grants totaling $65.6M in annual direct costs,
including 142 NCI grants, during this interval. By combining human and animal pathology cores from the previous
CCSG cycle into central management with improved efficiency/coordination, we have increased the number of
members served, types of biospecimens collected, number of samples processed/distributed, and the number
of protocols/clinical trials supported. We have increased TMA creation and offer new spatial and molecular
profiling services enabling members to perform innovative research that advances the UWCCC mission.
Continued CCSG support allows us to provide members with priority access to biospecimens, extensive
pathology services at low-cost and expert consultative support for their research needs."
10819131,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We and others have provided evidence that changes in brain function are caused by neuroadaptations
throughout the addiction cycle. Large-scale DNA and RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, and computational
approaches have greatly advanced addiction neurobiology. Our newly proposed research will use single cell
RNA sequencing to define the transcriptome in human alcoholic and CIE-exposed mouse brain in
unprecedented detail. In addition to the similar alcohol-responsive expression changes found in alcoholics and
CIE-treated mice, CIE vapor produces escalations in voluntary drinking and is a well-established animal model
of alcohol dependence. CIE as well as chronic voluntary consumption models also induce neurobiological and
behavioral adaptations in mice that mimic those found in human alcoholics. Unlike whole tissue sequencing,
the single cell approach is much more sensitive and prevents dilution of cell-specific expression changes. This
proposal will provide the first single cell resolution of convergent genes in human and mouse brain that are
associated with alcohol dependence and escalation in drinking. High-priority genes will be functionally
validated in mice, and new computational approaches based on integrated single cell-transcriptomic data will
then be used to predict and test drugs for efficacy to reduce drinking in mice. Our overarching hypothesis is
that conserved cell-type-induced transcriptome changes will reveal specific neurobiological mechanisms and
improved drug targets for excessive alcohol drinking. Integrated data from mouse and human brain enhance
our ability to predict pathways and drugs with translational relevance in humans."
10841045,"Central nervous system (CNS) diseases including neurological, oncological and psychiatric conditions
are the biggest healthcare expense worldwide. Biotechnological drugs such as antibodies are a frontline of
therapeutic progress elsewhere in the body, but the CNS diseases rarely benefit from them mostly due blood
brain barrier (BBB) limiting their penetration to the brain, as they have relatively large size. The benefit of
macromolecules mostly comes from higher specificity and safety over traditional small molecule approaches.
 Intra-arterial route of delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain is an intuitive approach and it has been
attempted for years but so far it has been plagued by the variability. We have recently shown that real-time
MRI guidance is capable to overcome these limitations. Moreover, macromolecules such as antibodies can be
far easier tagged and imaged than small molecules in majority of circumstances, which provides a unique
opportunity to be even more precise. Radiolabeling of antibodies can be performed by chelation of radiometals,
which is relatively simple process to be completed even by a biologist, and radionuclides can be easily shipped
from all over the country so no need for on-site cyclotron is needed. We have been first to show the
feasibility of merging technologies of antibody radiolabeling and intra-arterial delivery and observed
impressive benefits of this route of delivery. While, our early results are quite compelling there are still
many puzzles to be put together to better understand the advantages of intra-arterial route as they might be
crucial for a proper design of intra-arterial injections in patients, not only to eradicate variability but also to learn
what are the optimal conditions to take the most of the procedure.
 First, here we will learn how the antibody concentration in cerebral vasculature contributes to their
extravasation as well as we will look into the potential role of plasma-antibody interaction as a factor limiting
extravasation of intravenously administered antibody. This knowledge will provide clear guidelines on a
positioning catheter during intra-arterial infusions in patients, as if high concentration and no exposure of
antibody to blood are contribution factors, then the catheter should be placed quite distally in the cerebral
vessels to maximize the benefit of intra-arterial route. Then, we will learn what is the optimal concentration to
perform procedure safely while to maximize the brain uptake of antibodies. While, the direct numbers will apply
to mice only, it will also give a context to considerations to clinical translation. Then, we will study in detail the
potential impact of antibody delivery to the CNS on essential brain processes through getting insight into
transcriptomics and proteomics to detect potential negative consequences, which would then serve as a basis
for finding countermeasures. Ultimately, we will look into antibody clearance from the brain and the role of
targets for brain retention of antibodies. This part will also allow to assess the difference in antibody
extravasation to the brain cancer as well as will provide preliminary data on their therapeutic activity."

The Emory Psychiatry Clinical Scientist Training Program (CSTP) is designed to address critical shortages in
well-trained physician scientists pursuing a career in research, while increasing access to research training and
experiences for all residents. The Institute of Medicine deemed that sustaining and nurturing research interests
of residents is vital to the future of psychiatry research.
 This renewal of the Emory CSTP will continue to address critical gaps in research training for psychiatry
residents through four specific aims that leverage our previous successes, while building on lessons learned.
In AIM 1, we will continue to recruit, train and retain highly qualified physician-scientists and provide
protected time for intensive mentorship, didactics and individualized research experiences dedicated to
fostering an independent career in mental health research. Training will emphasize fundamentals in research
design, data analysis and computational methods, manuscript and grant preparation, presentation skills, rigor
and reproducibility and ethical conduct of research. In AIM 2, we will continue to provide an enhanced
research curriculum for all psychiatry residents through didactics and small-group experiential learning
activities including our “Particle to Professor” seminar series and opportunities for all psychiatry residents to
participate in CSTP research activities. In AIM 3, we will strive to increase the diversity of our program by
adding a Diversity Committee that will advise on strategies to attract and match applicants of diversity. We will
also launch a pilot program with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Morehouse School
of Medicine to increase residents from diverse backgrounds in the Emory CSTP and facilitate Morehouse's
development of their own research track. In AIM 4, we will establish a platform for ongoing collaboration
with other R25 programs and the NIMH to establish and disseminate best practices for achieving the goal of
increasing the number of physician scientists who successfully pursue a career in mental health research.
 The overarching objective of the Emory CSTP is to continue to provide enhanced research training for
all residents in psychiatry, while providing specialized mentored research training opportunities for residents
poised to become physician-scientists. The proposed program emphasizes proactive engagement and novel
mentored research opportunities through internet-based strategies, experiential research learning activities,
mentorship throughout residency and exposure to innovative research faculty and research programs in areas
including neuromodulation, the neurobiology of fear and trauma-related disorders, behavioral immunology and
endocrinology, neurodevelopment, translational social neuroscience, community psychiatry and public health.
Given a solid research training base, ongoing faculty support, mentorship, and independent research
experiences as well as specialized research training, CSTP research track residents will be well-equipped to
pursue academic careers, working to solve the most pressing problems in psychiatry."

Cellular senescence is a cause of cell and tissue aging. Senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses
and characterized by an irreversible proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescence-associated proliferation arrest and SASP
cooperate in tumor suppression, by arresting proliferation of damaged pre-malignant cells and promoting
immune clearance of the damaged cells. However, over the longer term, as a source of chronic inflammation,
SASP also promotes tissue aging and disease. Consequently, there is currently much effort devoted to
development of pharmacologic approaches to eliminate senescent cells to promote healthy aging. However,
these so-called senolytic drugs tend to show unwanted toxicities. An alternative, perhaps less toxic approach, is
to use senomorphic drugs to specifically inhibit the pro-aging SASP. Importantly, inhibition of SASP does not
necessarily impair the tumor suppressive role of senescence. On the contrary, elimination of SASP can prevent
cancer. Hence, it is important to define the mechanism of SASP activation, because its inhibition may be an
approach to combat the pro-aging effects of senescent cells.
Recently, we showed that senescent cells shed fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic
chromatin fragments (CCF), via a nucleus-to-cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF are very strongly positive for a
DNA damage marker, phosphorylated histone γH2AX. Formation of CCF depends upon a novel manifestation
of the cellular recycling process autophagy, specifically nuclear autophagy. CCF signal through cytoplasmic DNA
sensors to activate NFκB, the major transcriptional activator of SASP. Most recently, we have defined an
unanticipated upstream trigger of CCF and SASP, namely dysfunctional mitochondria in senescent cells.
Dysfunctional mitochondria are themselves already linked to chronic inflammation and aging.
We hypothesize that nuclear expulsion of CCF harboring DNA double strand breaks is a mechanism for
senescent cells with impaired DNA repair pathways to decrease the intranuclear load of toxic DNA double strand
breaks. We also hypothesize that dysfunctional mitochondria trigger autophagy-dependent formation of CCF in
senescent cells by retrograde mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling, involving JNK kinase and the transcription
factors Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1a (HIF1a), the “JNK-CCF” and “HIF-CCF” pathways, respectively.
Delineation of the JNK-CCF and HIF-CCF pathways and their interactions will provide new opportunities to
intervene to suppress chronic inflammation driven by SASP in vivo, thereby potentiating healthy aging and
longevity."

The National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation
Milestones articulate the goals of the Institute for advancing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The
Leadership Award for AD and Related Disorders requires that the applicant address objectives of the
Milestones and provide mentorship to new and early stage investigators. The research proposed must
be groundbreaking and paradigm changing. Among the eight focus areas within the Implementation
Milestones' framework are Trial Innovation and Translation and Clinical Research – Pharmacological.
The Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvationN (ACTION) Initiative proposed here embraces both the
research and mentoring aspects of the Leadership Award. The ACTION Initiative will include
development of a Clinical Trials Observatory (CTO) and an embedded mentorship program. The CTO
builds on the principal investigator's prior analyses of clinicaltrials.gov. This federal registry contains all
trials conducted in the US and many trials conducted ex-US. It includes Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials
of preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia trials. The PI has conducted and published research on the
trial design, biomarker, and clinical outcomes data from the registry. In 2016, Congress passed a law
requiring that trial outcomes be posted on the site within 1 year of completion of the trial. The PI proposes
to build a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, and bioinformatic experts
to interrogate the range of data now available using artificial intelligence techniques including machine
learning and deep learning. An external advisory committee will ensure quality and dissemination. The
Alzheimer's Association will collaborate on results dissemination. An accessible web portal for the
database will make reviewed data readily available for analyses and prediction/modeling of planned
clinical trials. The growing database of real-world AD trial data will allow increasingly precise prediction
of trial outcomes based on complex relationships among baseline features, trajectories of decline, drug
mechanisms, and clinical and biomarker characteristics across all stages of AD. The data will be used
by the PI, mentees, academic trial leaders, and industry trial sponsors. Three initial mentees are identified
from neuropsychology, psychiatry, and engineering; more will be added with growth of the program. The
ACTION Initiative has the potential to transform clinical trial planning and outcomes, leading to substantial
impact on the Implementation Milestones of the NIA and accelerating development of new therapies for
patients with AD and those at risk. Mentees will power the future of AD drug development and clinical
trial planning."
10823233,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most costly and burdensome disease in the U.S. Its public health impact will
only grow with the increase of 65-75 year olds in the next decade. The AD process begins 2 or more decades
before dementia onset. Identifying individuals during early stages (e.g., mild cognitive impairment ([MCI]) is
estimated to result in massive savings. Thus, NIH and Alzheimer's Association consensus statements
emphasize early identification. Like cardiovascular disease, focusing on middle age is crucial for earlier
identification of risk for cognitive decline, preclinical AD, and MCI. Despite this protracted progression of AD
pathology, little is known about its temporal course and relation to cognition in middle age. To address this
critical knowledge gap, we propose to collect a fourth wave of data in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging
(VETSA). VETSA provides detailed characterization of change throughout midlife. With wave 4, VETSA will
cover an 18-year period in our community-dwelling sample. VETSA began with virtually all subjects in their
50s, so we can track shifts from normal cognition to MCI/AD and normal to abnormal biomarker status. We
focus on 4 sets of indicators that improve the ability to identify at-risk individuals earlier than in most studies:
1) extensive cognitive testing; 2) plasma AD biomarkers for beta-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurofilament light
(NfL); 3) polygenic risk scores; and 4) novel assessments of cognitive processes. Almost all subjects will have
been Aβ- at VETSA 1. Average age at VETSA 4 will be 74, and a meta-analysis indicates that >30% of non-
demented adults at age 75 are Aβ+. Thus, leveraging data from previous waves, the timing is ideal to capture
the transition to disease states. We utilize the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarker classification
system and examine the proposed A→T→N staging of the AD continuum. Naturally, most research focuses
on ATN biomarkers as predictors, but it would be highly advantageous to identify people at risk before reaching
pathological Aβ levels. Thus, Aim1 will examine plasma ATN biomarker trajectories as well as predictors of
ATN biomarker accumulation and abnormality. We have biomarker data from VETSA 1 and 3, and will perform
assays on VETSA 4 data. Aim 2 models risk and protective factors for cognitive decline, biomarker
trajectories, and progression to MCI using genetically-informative analyses that can test causality. With 4 time
points, we will use our combination of twin and polygenic risk score data and our extensive health/medical and
psychosocial data to elucidate factors accounting for accelerated cognitive decline. In Aim 3, we evaluate 2
novel early risk indicators by: a) extending our work on pupil dilation as a measure of cognitive effort before
cognitive performance declines; and b) assessing visual short-term memory binding, an early indicator tested
primarily in familial AD families. To increase detection of decline, Aim 4 adds telephone/mailed assessments
partway in the funding period. Wave 4 will have N=1000. VETSA's unique features make it a most promising
resource for advancing knowledge about early identification, with potential for a profound public health impact."
11146849,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major clinical challenge due to the complex interaction of
biological, psychological, and social factors. Consequently, current pharmacological and non-pharmacological
treatments have variable and limited effectiveness resulting in the persistence of chronic pain during
adolescence into adulthood. Optimal treatment of chronic SCD pain requires an individualized, interdisciplinary
care approach that targets multifaceted biopsychosocial factors and common psychological comorbidities, such
as pain-related anxiety, fear of movement, and depression, that maintain chronic pain and functional impairment.
The objectives of the proposed research are to partner with patient and family stakeholders to adapt and refine
an existing mind-body, cognitive-behavioral, and neuromuscular movement treatment (Fibromyalgia Integrative
Training for Teens, FIT Teens) to target the unique needs and preferences of families managing chronic pain in
SCD (R61 phase) and conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the new adapted
intervention (termed I-STRONG for SCD) among youth with chronic SCD pain (R33 phase). The aims of the
proposed study are to: 1) adapt and refine the FIT Teens intervention to develop a new culturally tailored I-
STRONG intervention for youth with chronic SCD pain (R61 phase), 2) optimize the feasibility and acceptability
of I-STRONG for SCD (R61 phase), and 3) conduct a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate initial
effectiveness of I-STRONG for SCD (R33 phase). We will conduct mixed method approaches to collect
qualitative feedback informed by patient and family lived experiences regarding intervention content, format,
perceived benefits, and barriers/facilitators to engagement with youth who have chronic SCD pain and their
parents. Community stakeholder advisory boards and iterative design will inform intervention adaptation and
refinement to enhance clinical implementation. We hypothesize that patients receiving I-STRONG will
demonstrate significant reduction in pain interference and pain intensity (primary outcomes), and significant
improvements in depressive symptoms, pain-related fear of movement, and health-related quality of life
(secondary outcomes), and objectively measured physical activity (exploratory outcomes) at 3-month follow-up
(primary endpoint) and 6-month follow-up. Our long-term goal is to optimize chronic SCD pain management
through a multicomponent integrative approach that will be scalable for broad dissemination."
10832035,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Only 20-30% of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) exhibit long-term benefits with leading
pharmacologic (e.g., acamprosate, naltrexone) and behavioral therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy,
contingency management). Nearly half of individuals seeking treatment for AUD experience clinically
significant anxiety and depression symptoms (ANX/DEP), which relate to worse long-term outcomes. Positive
valence system (PVS) dysfunction is a common and pernicious feature of both AUD and ANX/DEP that is
predictive of poor functioning and prognosis. Although PVS dysfunction represents a shared pathophysiologic
mechanism across AUD and ANX/DEP, it is not sufficiently targeted by existing treatments.
 Our team developed a behavioral intervention, Amplification of Positivity (AMP), to enhance PVS
function through increasing exposure and responsivity to non-drug rewards. In our previous work, AMP was
found to increase positive valence outcomes (e.g., positive affect, social connectedness, life satisfaction),
enhance reactivity of PVS neural circuits (i.e., striatal response to social reward), and decrease negative
valence outcomes and symptoms for individuals with ANX/DEP. We have begun to modify this intervention for
the treatment of co-occurring AUD and ANX/DEP (AMP-A), completing an initial pilot feasibility study.
 For the proposed study, we will further develop and refine AMP-A based upon qualitative and
quantitative feedback from clinicians and participants and complete a pilot study of the protocol with eight
individuals diagnosed with AUD and reporting clinically elevated ANX/DEP symptoms - further refining the
protocol based on feedback from this pilot. We will then recruit 60 individuals with AUD+ANX/DEP and
randomize them to complete AMP-A or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – a first-line treatment for AUD that
has small effects on the PVS. All participants will complete clinical and self-report measures before, during and
after therapy and at 3-month follow-up.
 This project will accomplish the following aims: (1) Further develop and refine AMP-A to optimize its
acceptability and potential clinical utility; (2) Determine the effects of AMP-A compared to CBT on the PVS, as
measured by self-report of positive affect, social connectedness, well-being, and reward processing; (3)
Determine whether increases in PVS function are associated with greater clinical improvement of alcohol use,
anxiety, and depression. Results will have important implications for the treatment of AUD and co-occurring
anxiety or depression by determining the utility of directly targeting the PVS, which will pave the way for future
research seeking to remediate the harmful effects of these conditions."
10837767,"Dopamine D2 receptors, the targets of all antipsychotic drugs currently available, have been reported to form
dimeric and/or oligomeric complexes with many other receptors. These complexes and their functional properties
are of great interest given the possibility of developing novel therapeutics that selectively target distinct receptor
complexes, with the potential of reduced side-effects. Nevertheless, there is still great debate about whether
these and other class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) complexes even exist, as well as their potential
physiological relevance. Of the methods capable of detecting receptor interactions in living cells, single-molecule
imaging techniques offer the distinct advantage of potentially revealing the stochastic and dynamic behaviors of
individual molecules in real time, without the population and time averaging inherent in ensemble measurements.
Specifically, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a robust tool for reporting
interaction distances less than 10 nm, but has rarely been used in mammalian cells, and never with GPCRs, due
to multiple experimental challenges. We have now developed robust methods for imaging, tracking, and
quantifying smFRET of GPCRs in living cells. In parallel, using pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-
correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) we can robustly explore interactions at much higher levels of receptor
expression. While we find that the class A mu opioid receptor is a monomer over a 1000-fold range of receptor
expression, our preliminary results show that the D2R does in fact transiently interact in the membrane when
expressed at high densities. Furthermore, using PIE-FCCS we see strong evidence for heteromeric interactions
of D2R and adenosine A2A receptor, a heteromeric pair shown to exhibit substantial functional crosstalk. We
propose to study the dynamics of these interactions and to identify modulators of their kinetics, as tools to probe
the potential role of homodimers and heterodimers in vivo. We will also extend our studies to the D2R-NMDA
receptor (NMDAR) heteromer, a complex that we have now shown to be upregulated both in rodent and human
brain exposed to psychostimulants that elevate extracellular dopamine levels. Although the mechanism is
unknown, there is evidence that D2R activation leads through increased D2R-NMDAR to inhibition of NMDAR
currents and reduced neuronal excitability, suggesting a novel molecular target for integration of dopamine
signaling and glutamatergic signaling, both of which have been implicated in schizophrenia and psychosis.
 We thus propose the following specific aims to expand our lab’s ongoing multi-level approach to
understanding dopamine receptor structure and function both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1: Determine the dynamics
of dopamine D2R homo- and Class A GPCR hetero-dimerization in living cells and in brain slices and identify
modulators of these dynamics to probe their functional effects. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms that regulate
D2R-NMDAR interactions and D2R-activation-dependent inhibition of NMDA currents in D2R-expressing
neurons of the striatum."

The explore-exploit dilemma refers to the challenge of deciding when to forego choices with known
consequences to explore new opportunities and learn more about them. Managing this trade-off is a fundamental
component of behavioral flexibility. Excessive exploration or exploitation impedes learning and results in poor
choices leading to undesired outcomes. Explore-exploit decision making is understudied in psychiatry despite
its ecological validity and relevance in understanding disorders characterized by inflexible behaviors. One reason
for this is we have not identified if the brain encodes information relevant for managing explore-exploit tradeoffs
differently when exploration is motivated by either appetitive or aversive consequences. Another reason is that
while there is evidence in humans that frontopolar cortex—the most anterior part of prefrontal cortex which is
unique to primates—implements decisions to explore new opportunities, the neural mechanisms underlying
changes in frontopolar activity that prompt exploration are unclear. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex,
basolateral amygdala, and nucleus accumbens encode value signals that inform explore-exploit decisions. This
suggests a more dynamic interplay between frontopolar cortex and motivational brain regions during explore-
exploit decision making than is currently hypothesized. This proposal tests the hypothesis that frontopolar cortex
implements decisions to explore, but is reliant on appetitive and aversive value signals computed in motivational
neural circuits to balance exploration and exploitation. We predict that bottom-up feedback to frontopolar cortex
from brain regions classically associated with signaling reward value is critical for balancing exploration and
exploitation. In Aim 1 we will test if monkeys explore more often when choices in a multi-arm bandit task are
associated with gains or losses, and use computational modeling of choices to define valence dependent
differences in their willingness to explore. In Aim 2 we will simultaneously record neural activity in frontopolar
and orbitofrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and nucleus accumbens to determine if bottom-up information
flow from motivational brain regions to frontopolar cortex predicts decisions to explore or exploit, and if
exploratory choices are encoded differently when exploration is motivated by gains versus losses. In Aim 3 will
use pathway-specific chemogenetics to excite or inhibit basolateral amygdala neurons that project to the nucleus
accumbens, while recording neural activity in the nucleus accumbens and frontopolar cortex. We will to test the
prediction that excitation of this pathway increases exploitation due to heightened encoding of exploitative signals
in nucleus accumbens and decreased encoding of exploration signals in frontopolar cortex. Upon completion of
these aims, we will understand how imbalances in explore-exploit decision making emerge in different psychiatric
disorders based on the integrity of prefrontal cortex and motivational circuits."
10615823,"Chronic pain affects >100 million American adults with estimated costs of up to $1 trillion annually. Older adults
are at increased risk of having multiple painful conditions and are living longer with the negative impacts of
chronic pain. Chronic pain, regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved (e.g., back pain, migraine), is the
leading cause of disability worldwide. Limited insights into whether common mechanisms underlie all pain
conditions, regardless of diagnosis, has contributed to inadequate pain management options, and in turn, to the
opioid epidemic. Health care providers who treat one pain condition (e.g., joint pain) typically do not manage
symptoms in other parts of the body (e.g., abdominal pain), and patients are often referred from one specialist
to another. Studying commonalities of various chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPC) in community-based
cohorts unselected for pain conditions can provide novel insights into causes of chronic pain as a disease itself,
and into shared risk factors that may be promising targets to help ameliorate chronic pain regardless of diagnosis.
Alterations in nociceptive signaling such as pain sensitization assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST)
may commonly underlie chronic pain, but why such alterations occur is not known, and whether such nociceptive
signaling changes are heritable is also not known. Beyond nociception, there may be broader nervous system
dysfunction underlying chronic pain. Generalized heightened sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., light, sound) and
impaired autonomic nervous system functioning, reflected by diminished heart rate variability (HRV), are
associated with chronic pain, but it is unclear if they contribute to COPC, QST-assessed abnormalities, or
development of chronic pain. Treatments targeting these potential risk factors could represent new avenues for
pain management. Another untapped potential is in understanding whether positive factors such as resilience,
sleep quality, and physical activity can be harnessed to alter risk of COPC or QST abnormalities. We propose
evaluating COPC in the upcoming study visit of a community-based middle age and older adult cohort unselected
for any pain complaints, the 3rd Generation of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (N~3374, mean age 60).
We aim to understand the relation of multisensory sensitivity, autonomic function, resilience, sleep, and physical
activity to COPC, QST-assessed pain processing and evolution of chronic pain over time; and to study heritability
of QST abnormalities. Understanding the relation of these novel factors to COPC and QST would spur
development of novel pain management approaches for all types of pain regardless of diagnosis involved. We
will collect data regarding common chronic pain complaints, QST (to assess pain sensitization), and proposed
risk factors, and conduct two follow-up assessments to obtain longitudinal data. We will leverage the ongoing
FHS Offspring (2nd Generation) Exam in which we are collecting the same QST measures to assess heritability
of pain processing abnormalities. Our work will address several knowledge gaps, and insights gained may
facilitate new approaches to relieving chronic pain and its consequences, regardless of underlying diagnosis."

African American (AA) men have the highest incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer in the United
States. We recently showed that AA men with low-risk prostate cancer have a two-fold increased risk of death
compared to men of other racial groups. While the causes of this stark disparity are multifactorial, we
hypothesize that low-risk prostate cancer in AA men harbor unique genomic alterations that give rise to more
aggressive prostate cancer. Towards this end, we have performed an initial meta-analysis of existing sequencing
studies and found candidate driver genes associated with ancestry. However, the ability to determine the effect
of these candidates on prostate cancer biology is limited due to the lack of biological cell models from different
ancestral backgrounds. In Aim 1, we will find additional molecular alterations associated with grade using whole
exome sequencing of prostate cancer cases from 300 AA men and 200 men from a European background using
a collection of archived specimens from Boston Medical Center and UCSF. In Aim 2, we will characterize the
transcriptomic and proteomic states of different prostate epithelial cell populations by performing single-cell RNA-
seq and mass spectrometry of organoids derived from AA and EA men. In Aim 3, we will develop new prostate
cell models from AA patients using a conditional reprogramming method. We will then perturb ancestry- and
grade-associated driver genes using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and determine whether the functional effects
of these genes are augmented in different ancestral backgrounds. At the conclusion of these studies we will
have expanded our understanding of the molecular pathways are associated with aggressiveness in different
ancestral backgrounds. We will also generate a large resource of prostate cell models from AA men for the
scientific community to investigate prostate cancer disparities. This project will generate substantial knowledge
of the mechanisms that underlie prostate cancer disparities that could ultimately lead to improved treatment of
AA men with prostate cancer and the reduction of cancer health disparities."

Young adult men and women perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV) at high rates. A summary of over 30
years of research concludes that alcohol is a causal factor of IPV, particularly acute alcohol intoxication,
highlighting the critical need for interventions delivered proximally to drinking episodes – a period of increased
risk for IPV. Yet despite the high societal and personal costs associated with heavy drinking and IPV and the
high prevalence of alcohol facilitated IPV, empirically supported interventions are lacking, particularly those
that are low resource and easily scalable for wide dissemination. It is increasingly feasible to deliver Just-In-
Time (JIT) interventions via mobile technology, particularly those that adapt over time to an individual's
changing needs to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context – Just-In-
Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs). JITAIs have been evaluated for a range of behavioral health issues
including alcohol use; however, no empirically supported JITAIs for alcohol-facilitated IPV perpetration exist.
To develop JITAIs, JIT interventions are optimized through innovative micro-randomized trials (MRTs) in which
individuals are micro-randomized to receive different intervention strategies at critical time points to determine
when a message is best delivered, which type of message is most impactful for whom, and under what
conditions. Thus, the present application will combine a traditional RCT to evaluate the efficacy of delivering
JIT messages to reduce alcohol facilitated IPV perpetration with a MRT to optimize the selection and
adaptation of messages for a future JITAI. The proposed intervention focuses on theoretically and empirically
supported targets for IPV perpetration consistent with the I3 Model – the prevailing unifying theory of IPV
perpetration – including distress tolerance skills, emotion regulation skills, and alcohol reduction strategies. An
RCT by the PI (K08AA021745) supports these intervention targets for reducing alcohol use and IPV
perpetration among women with sexual assault histories, and a recent pilot study supports the feasibility and
acceptability of delivering these JIT messages using a MRT design to at-risk men and women with good
effects of the intervention on key alcohol and IPV outcomes. As such, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of
this JIT messaging intervention in 400 heavy drinking young adults with recent IPV perpetration. Participants
will be randomized to the JIT messaging intervention or an assessment only control (RCT design). All
participants will complete a baseline survey, 30-days of twice daily monitoring, and 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-
up surveys. Within the intervention arm (MRT design), individuals will be micro-randomized after each morning
and evening report during the 30 days of monitoring to (1) receive a JIT message or not, and (2) if yes, to one
of three message types (distress tolerance skill, ER skill, alcohol reduction strategy). This innovative design will
optimize the selection and adaptation of JIT messages for a future JITAI to reduce alcohol facilitated IPV."

We propose to elucidate the lineage-specific mechanisms of 3D genome organization by studying the role of
IKAROS in: a) regulatory loop (RL) formation supported by enhancer-based long-distance interactions and b)
structural loop (SL) and insulated domain formation supported by CTCF interactions at architectural sites.
Aim1. Lineage-specific regulation of genome organization principles.
Here we address the functional interactions between enhancer-based RL and a novel class of dynamic
structural loops (DSL) that we propose are integral to lineage segregation. Their role in lineage segregation is
tested by comparative analysis of their formation after IKAROS-loss-of-function in large preB and -gain-of-
function in epithelial cells. We test the hypothesis that IKAROS represses these DSL whose induction causes
de-repression of extra-lineage gene profiles, notably those appropriate for epithelial cells. We examine whether
this is a direct mechanism by which IKAROS and the NURD complex co-occupy a subset of CTCF sites that
form DSL when either factors are removed. Alternatively we test whether IKAROS repression of DSL is indirect
and relates to IKAROS’ role as an RL organizer.
Aim2. Mechanisms of IKAROS regulation of super-enhancer assemblies
Here we focus on the mechanisms by which IKAROS mediates assembly of super-enhancers (SE). We
hypothesize that higher order interactions between IKAROS proteins bound at different chromosomal sites
contributes to the formation of SE structures that entrap regulatory sites and associated factors in a confined
space to mediate their function. The role of distinct IKBS and the requirement for specific IKAROS protein
domains in the assembly SE is tested. We examine the role of assembled IKAROS complexes in segregating
bound chromatin into regions of the nucleus with distinctive properties. Finally, we test whether the role of
IKAROS in regulating SE assemblies is involved in Igk locus contraction."

 Heart failure leads to >1.4 million hospitalizations annually in the U.S. During these acute decompensated
heart failure (ADHF) hospitalizations, the kidneys’ health influences almost every aspect of management,
including initial diuretic dosing, treatment intensification, and discharge planning. However, clinical reliance on
serum creatinine, an insensitive, nonspecific and often misleading kidney biomarker, substantially contributes
to suboptimal ADHF treatment. Although guidelines suggest that clinicians use the patient’s kidney function as
an indicator for the initial diuretic dose, the creatinine is actually a poor predictor of diuretic response and
clinicians must resort to “trial and error” in searching for each patient’s optimal dose. Further, although
creatinine elevations during treatment commonly reflect beneficial effects, clinicians typically de-escalate
diuresis from fear of worsening kidney damage. During discharge planning, this fear also drives clinicians to
prescribe an oral diuretic dose that is too low, and to avoid beneficial therapies. These obstacles to ideal care
culminate in delayed symptom relief, prolonged hospitalization, frequent readmissions, and high mortality risk.
 Given the kidney tubules’ central role in determining the effectiveness and safety of ADHF pharmacological
treatment, clinicians need tools that capture kidney tubule health to optimize diuretic strategies, improve
delivery of guideline-directed medical therapy, and minimize the risk for true kidney damage. In ambulatory
settings, our team has demonstrated the remarkable ability of tubule health measures to detect kidney damage
early, to reflect the kidneys’ response to treatment more accurately that creatinine, and to predict long-term
outcomes. Early studies of a few tubule markers in ADHF show that they improve in proportion to diuretic
response and have tremendous potential to change how kidney health is monitored during ADHF treatment.
 Given the central role of kidney health in ADHF treatment and prognosis, our overall goals are to
fundamentally change how clinicians approach kidney health monitoring and clinical decision-making during
ADHF treatment. To achieve these goals, we will capitalize on the well-characterized Mechanisms of Diuretic
Resistance (MDR) Study, a cohort of patients hospitalized for ADHF who have undergone serial biospecimen
collections timed to diuretic treatment throughout hospitalization with longitudinal follow-up for key clinical
outcomes. We will measure a broad panel of kidney biomarkers that reflect tubule reabsorptive and secretory
functions, injury, synthetic and reparative capacity, and tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. We will
identify which tubule health measures most effectively: 1) predict treatment response to initial loop diuretic

patients with creatinine elevations during treatment (Aim 2); and 3) identify patients appropriate for discharge

groundwork for a clinical trial to test a kidney biomarker-guided ADHF treatment strategy."
10838419,"Project Summary:
Hypertension is the most important risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and reduction in blood
pressure (BP) after stroke is associated with reduced risk of stroke recurrence1-4. However, for the majority of
stroke survivors (SS), hypertension remains poorly controlled early after an incident stroke.5-7 In the United
States, Black and Hispanic SS are more likely to have poorly controlled risk factors after stroke compared to
White SS, and Black and Hispanic SS have higher rates of stroke recurrence compared to White SS.5-11 Prior
efforts to reduce racial disparities in BP control among SS have been uniformly unsuccessful.12
Multicomponent care models that include multidisciplinary approaches show promise for improving risk factor
control after stroke.13, 14 Social determinants of health (SDOH) help to explain racial disparities in BP control
and stroke recurrence, therefore multidisciplinary post-stroke care models that target SDOH may be key to
decreasing disparities in BP control.5, 7, 15 Limited access to post-stroke outpatient care contributes to
challenges in developing system-level interventions for post-stroke BP control. Telemedicine and
telemonitoring may be ideal approaches for improving access to care in SS. The COVID-19 pandemic has led
to rapid expansion of telemedicine for post-acute care in stroke survivors; however, its effectiveness is
unproven. Based on preliminary data at our center, we propose a randomized trial testing an integrated
multidisciplinary telehealth intervention, the Video-based Intervention to Reduce Treatment and OUtcome
Disparities in Adults Living with Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (VIRTUAL), in SS recently discharged
home after inpatient hospitalization for ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The
intervention will include post-discharge telehealth visits by a multidisciplinary team, social risk assessments to
facilitate social risk-targeted and social risk-informed care, and home BP telemonitoring and management. The
care team includes neurology providers (physician and nurse practitioner), a pharmacist, and a social worker.
Standard care will include follow-up with a neurologist and primary care provider and pharmacist-assisted BP
adjustment. We aim to assess 1) the impact of the intervention on BP control 6 months following stroke
assessed with ambulatory BP monitoring; 2) the impact of the intervention on recurrent vascular events 1 year
after stroke; 3) the impact of the intervention on health services access and utilization following stroke; 4)
moderating effects of race / ethnicity on the impact of the intervention on BP control, vascular events, and
health services utilization; 5) the relationship between additional measured SDOH and primary and secondary
outcomes."
10848198,"Cells of intestinal epithelium do not exhibit a uniform metabolic state. Metabolic shifts accompany
transitions during adult stem-crypt-villus homeostasis. Metabolic shifts also occur in response to injury and in
colon cancer. The long term goal of this research is to define targetable metabolic regulatory processes to treat
diseases and disorders of the intestine. The immediate goal of this proposal is to define the regulatory
mechanisms that govern metabolic shifts during the epithelial cell lifespan.
 OX-PHOS gene expression levels are high in intestinal stem cells, low in crypts, and highest in villus.
Dynamic expression of OX-PHOS genes parallels the metabolic transitions of the epithelium. However, the
mechanisms regulating cellular metabolism during epithelial cell transitions in the intestine are unclear. We
have generated new mouse models that identify transcription factors contributing to epithelial metabolism.
 Aim 1 of the proposed studies will drill down to identify how the transcription factor, YY1, promotes
expression of genes that drive the electron transport chain. We will test the hypothesis that YY1 regulates
enhancer-promoter chromatin looping to promote expression of these key genes required for mitochondrial
respiration. We will also test the hypothesis that YY1 function differs in intestinal stem cells versus in their
progeny in crypts or in villus enterocytes. State-of-the-art epigenomic and proteomic assays will be employed
in the context of novel mouse models. We expect these regulatory mechanisms are important to drive
metabolic shifts that occur upon exposure to low oxygen environments during tissue damage/regeneration or in
oncogenesis. Therefore, we will also investigate these regulatory mechanisms in regenerative foci after tissue
damage to discern whether YY1 controls the metabolic shifts that accompany tissue regeneration.
 Aim 2 will look at regulation of an important energy source for mitochondrial respiration – fatty acid
oxidation. We will test the hypothesis that HNF4 transcription factors promote fatty acid oxidation to support
intestinal stem cell renewal. A combination of metabolomics, epigenomics, and organoid-based assays will be
employed, using novel mouse models. We will further test the hypothesis that the Estrogen-Related Receptor
is an important and novel partner factor of HNF4, and that together, HNF4 and ESRRA shape the response of
the intestinal epithelium in response to a change in dietary fat. To our knowledge, these studies would provide
the first link between the core intestinal transcription factor regulatory networks and the metabolic state
required for intestinal stemness. Excess dietary fat increases risk for obesity and colon cancer. Our studies will
move the field forward in linking how diet and metabolites can intersect with the transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms of the intestinal epithelium. Together, these studies will reveal how metabolic transitions are
regulated in the intestine during normal homeostasis, as well as under pathological situations (epithelial
regeneration or under high-fat diet)."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's (UCDCCC) Administration team provides the foundation
necessary to foster, support, and promote the UCDCCC's basic, clinical, translational, and population-based
research in order to mitigate the cancer burden in the catchment area and beyond. Administration supports the
Director; Senior Leaders; Program Leaders; Shared Resource Directors; Office of Community Outreach and
Engagement; Office of Education, Training, and Career Development; and the Office of Clinical Research. Its
procedural functions are to provide fiscal management and administrative support for the NCI Cancer Center
Support Grant (CCSG) and all related activities to include membership, information technology, space
management and allocation of resources, development, strategic communications, fostering collaborations
across the university to meet the scientific goals of the Center; and ensuring effective and efficient operation of
the Center's organizational units. The Specific Aims for Administration are to: 1) Advance the Center's mission,
vision, and values through administrative leadership in the strategic planning, management, and organization
of the Cancer Center; 2) Foster inter-and intra-programmatic collaborations and communication to leverage the
expertise of the Center's membership to facilitate research addressing the cancer burden of the UCDCCC
catchment area; and 3) Provide financial management and administrative oversight to ensure the efficient and
optimal use of UCDCCC funds and resources in order to promote scientific productivity and impact."
10876299,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (SRM)
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The eight Shared Resources (SRs) plus one developing SR are critical to the research mission of the UC
Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC). The SRs provide members access to technologies,
services, and experimental planning advice and consultation that enhance research interactions and
productivity, facilitate cancer-related research activity, and enable cost-effective and efficient operations.
Specifically, the SRs offer cancer researchers centralized access to specialized scientific expertise,
infrastructure and equipment, robust technologies, advanced instrumentation, and subsidized services. To
enable the SRs to fulfill these roles and expectations, the UCDCCC administration centralizes SR
management, supports, and coordinates SR activities, and provides essential operational infrastructure and
business processes. The UCDCCC administration manages the SRs and establishes appropriate policies
governing their use, including assuring accessibility to members across the Sacramento and Davis campuses;
monitoring the quality of the SRs; determining current and future scientific needs of UCDCCC members;
determining future plans for SRs, including those in development; ensuring sound financial support for SRs;
and interacting with the main campus in the planning, oversight, and coordination of institutional cores,
services, and other campus resource and service cores. Operational oversight is provided by the AD for SRs
KC Kent Lloyd, DVM, PhD, who supervises and supports fiscal management, evaluation and assessment
tools, outreach and marketing mechanisms, strategies to maximize utilization and functional efficiency of the
SRs, and the development of new SRs. Since the last competitive renewal, significant improvements have
been made and new processes and mechanisms implemented that optimize centralized oversight,
coordination, and operational efficiency of all SRs. For example, members with peer-reviewed, funded projects,
have prioritized and/or subsidized access to SRs compared to all other users. Fees charged to members using
SRs for cancer-related research are subsidized to a varying extent (generally 13-30%), depending on the type
of service and on each SRs budget. In some cases (e.g., biostatistics), the SR does not direct charge users but
instead uses non-CCSG funds for salary support to render services to UCDCCC members. To facilitate these
and other activities, centralized SRM’s Specific Aims are to: 1) Meet the scientific needs of UCDCCC members
through centralized management of high-quality SRs. 2) Assist with the promotion of research collaborations to
increase scientific impact of the UCDCCC. 3) Provide business support for the SRs by establishing appropriate
policies, business practices, operational processes, and infrastructure governing their use and accessibility to
UCDCCC members. 4) Establish common processes to determine and respond to current and future scientific
needs of SR users."
10876303,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The CPDM provides unified oversight and support for coordinating, facilitating, and reporting on clinical trials
managed by the University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center. The CPDM research strategy is
composed of four sections that describe the processes involved in conducting clinical trials uniformly and
safely. Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management is managed by the Office of Clinical Research (OCR),
which is led by Karen Kelly, MD (OCR Medical Director) and Ahmed Bayoumi, MD (OCR Executive Director).
The OCR includes six units: operations, business, regulatory, clinical, data, and correlative lab thus providing
Cancer Center investigators with centralized services to conduct clinical trials. The OCR staff work cohesively
with the investigators to provide subjects with exceptional care such that toxicities are minimized, trial
adherence is maintained, and data quality is achieved. Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring. All clinical trials
conducted under UCDCCC include provisions for data and safety monitoring. The Data Safety and Monitoring
Plan (DSMP) focuses on patient safety, protocol adherence, and data quality. In anticipation for the CCSG
competitive renewal, the DSMP was revised and subsequently approved by the NCI in August 2020. Part III:
Inclusion of Minorities and Women in Clinical Trials. The UCDCCC is dedicated to the inclusion of women and
minorities in cancer clinical trials and complies with the NIH regulations on accrual of these populations. Entry
criteria for cancer studies are disease, not gender or ethnicity specific. However, the Center has recruitment
strategies specifically focused on women and minority populations who experience disparities, for example,
liver cancer (Asian Americans and all populations of color), prostate cancer (African Americans and
Hispanics/Latinos), and breast cancer (African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian Americans). Part IV:
Inclusion of Across the Lifespan in Clinical Trials. To ensure patients from all ages are recruited to trials,
UCDCCC has intensified its plans to recruit pediatric patients and will begin raising awareness and developing
recruitment plans to enroll patients > 64 years old."
10876306,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)
provides a mechanism for ensuring internal oversight of the scientific and research aspects of cancer clinical
trials and for assuring that the UCDCCC's clinical resources are optimally engaged. The PRMS is intended to
cover clinical research activity meeting the NCI definition of a clinical trial, as defined in the Data and Safety
Monitoring Plan (DSMP). During the reporting period, the PRMS implemented several key processes to ensure
UCDCCC is maintaining a robust clinical research portfolio. The PRMS is comprised of two key committees
including the Disease Team Committees (DTCs) and the Scientific Review Committee (SRC). The DTCs and
SRC are responsible for the rigorous review of clinical protocols through a sequential two-stage process. At
UCDCCC, there are seven multidisciplinary, oncology focused DTCs including Breast, Gastrointestinal,
Genitourinary, Hematological malignancies, Phase I, Pediatrics, and Thoracic. Using standardized review
criteria, DTCs conduct the initial evaluation of a potential protocol for value, fit, and prioritization within the
UCDCCC trial portfolio. A protocol must be endorsed by the DTCs before heading to the SRC. The SRC is the
definitive independent authority that determines if a trial will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) for subsequent activation. The SRC provides essential review elements for scientific merit, prioritization,
resource allocation, and accrual monitoring. Once a trial is activated, an SRC sub-committee called the
Protocol Accrual Monitoring Committee (PAMC) is responsible for regularly reviewing trial accruals and
communicating with investigators. Based on PAMC findings, reminders are sent to investigators prior to SRC
intervention, in order to allow corrective actions or clarifications of issues. Once PAMC makes a
recommendation to close a trial due to poor or no accrual, the recommendation returns to SRC who has the
final authority to close that trial."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Combinatorial Chemistry and Chemical Biology Shared Resource (CCCBSR) provides outstanding
services and expertise on rapid lead discovery through one-bead one-compound (OBOC) and one-bead two-
compound (OB2C) combinatorial library platforms for cancer researchers to screen thousands to millions of
diverse molecules in a high throughput fashion against a variety of targets such as cancer cells, T cells,
cancer-associated proteins, antibodies and exosomes. The OBOC and OB2C libraries provided by the
CCCBSR cover various classes of chemical which include peptides containing unnatural amino acids,
peptidomimetics, peptoids, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), macrocycles and small molecules; thereby meeting a
variety of scientific needs. These powerful combinatorial library methods not only offer great potential for
facilitating the drug discovery process but also provide powerful tools for basic research in various disciplines.
These methods enable investigators to generate and screen large numbers of chemical compounds that can
be used as valuable sources for the discovery of drug leads, molecular imaging agents, and capturing agents
for molecular biomarkers. For basic research, large collections of chemical compounds can be used to probe
their effects on specific cellular function. Compounds that elicit or suppress a specific cellular response can
then be identified and used as reagents to study cellular pathways involved in these cellular functions. The
CCCBSR also provides rapid lead optimization via combination of combinatorial library approach and standard
medicinal chemistry techniques to members of the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC).
Oversight and management of the CCCBSR is provided by the Director, Kit Lam, MD, PhD, an expert in
clinical, biochemical, and industrial experiences which are highly relevant to clinical translational research; and
the co-Director, Ruiwu Liu, PhD, an expert in organic and peptide synthesis, and multi-step synthesis of

10848203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains incurable despite biologic therapies. We previously identified a
functional promoter polymorphism in the gene for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) - a cytokine
our group first cloned, that is associated with erosive joint destruction in RA. MIF is known to regulate the
innate response by inhibiting glucocorticoid action, suppressing activation-induced apoptosis, and
promoting macrophage retention in tissues. The role of MIF and high expression MIF alleles is not fully
understood however, especially with respect to alterations in the adaptive response that perpetuate
inflammation, pathologic progression, and disease persistence. We have discovered a novel T cell
subpopulation that expresses the MIF receptor (CD74), expands during arthritis, and recapitulates disease
when transferred into naïve hosts. A similar population exists in human rheumatoid synovium. We
hypothesize that CD4+CD74+ T cells play a key role in rheumatoid inflammation, disease progression, and
relapse. We will pursue three Specific Aims in this proposal: 1. Define the pathogenic role of a novel,
MIF receptor expressing T cell sub-population (CD4+CD74+ T cells) in inflammatory arthritis. We
hypothesize that CD4+CD74+ T cells express inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic receptors that
contribute to synovial joint destruction. We will characterize the MIF signaling and effector responses of
mouse and human CD4+CD74+ T cells, identify trafficking factors/receptors, and establish their pathogenic
potential. 2. Define the impact of high-genotypic MIF expression on joint immunopathology in a
novel humanized MIF mouse model. We hypothesize that MIF expression drives pathologic CD4+CD74+
T cell trafficking and effector responses, and unremitting arthritis. We will test this hypothesis using novel
humanized MIF mice that express low-expression and high-expression human MIF alleles. 3. Evaluate the
impact of ICBP90 inhibition on MIF expression in humanized MIF mice and in high genotypic MIF
expressing human cells. We identified both the transcription factor (ICBP90) that upregulates MIF
transcription at its variant promoter microsatellite (-794 CATT5-8), and a drug-like molecule (CMFT) that
blocks ICBP90 binding to this promoter site. We hypothesize that ICBP90 inhibition will ameliorate the MIF-
dependent expansion and effector response of CD4+CD74+ T cells. We will test this possibility in
experimental arthritis and examine ICBP90 inhibition in high-genotypic MIF expressing human cells
obtained from peripheral blood and from rheumatoid synovial tissue. The completion of these Aims will
provide insight into the pathologic role of a novel, MIF receptor expressing T cell population and the
contribution of MIF risk alleles to rheumatoid inflammation. These studies also will accelerate consideration
of a precision-based approach for treating RA joint destruction."
10833594,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of my laboratory is to define the molecular mechanisms by which accurate cell division occurs. Our
efforts focus on the core cell division machinery, including the macromolecular kinetochore and the
microtubule-based mitotic spindle. Despite the central importance of the spindle and the kinetochore, the
molecular basis for their many activities remains incompletely understood. We seek to generate a coherent
molecular model for how the multiple kinetochore components and spindle-associated proteins act individually
and in an integrated manner to direct faithful chromosome segregation. For chromosome segregation to occur,
kinetochores must stably associate with a single site on each chromosome, build a large macromolecular
assembly, form robust interactions with the dynamic microtubule polymers from a bipolar mitotic spindle, and
these activities must be precisely regulated to ensure that chromosome segregation occurs with high fidelity. In
addition to the function of these molecular players in actively dividing cells, the cell division machinery must
also be differentially modulated across diverse physiological conditions, for example during meiotic cell
divisions or during the persistent cell cycle arrest that occurs in quiescent cells. To analyze these key
questions, our work uses a combination of functional genetics approaches in human cells, cell biological
studies on protein localization and dynamics, affinity purification and proteomics approaches to identify protein
interactions and modifications, and biochemical reconstitutions. For our recent work, we have also
implemented large-scale approaches to analyzing cellular phenotypes using Cas9-based optical screening,
which has transformed our ability to systematically define the contributions of human genes to cell division and
other core cellular processes
Over the next 5 years, our lab will investigate the fundamental mechanisms of cell division in human cells,
focusing on three interrelated goals: 1) Analyze the molecular basis for chromosome segregation, 2) Define the
basis for the cellular changes that occur during non-dividing cell states, such as quiescence and senescence,
and 3) Conduct large-scale cell biological and functional genetics approaches to analyze cell division."
10860989,"Project Summary: Although calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), including tacrolimus have led to excellent 1-year
outcomes in heart transplantation, long-term survival remains limited by cardiac allograft vasculopathy, driven
by donor-specific-antibodies (DSA), and by CNI-associated morbidity, dominated by chronic kidney disease.
Belatacept, a selective costimulation blocker, is FDA approved for use in kidney transplantation as a CNI-
alternative. By inhibiting CD28/CD80/CD86 interactions belatacept prevents activation of both naïve T cell and
T follicular helper cells associated with the development of DSA, but less effectively inhibits memory T cells. In
kidney transplant recipients, this has translated to sustained improvement in kidney function, suppression of
DSA, and improved graft/patient survival, albeit at the cost of more early rejection which has since been
markedly reduced by using a delayed CNI substitution strategy. Building on these findings, we propose a
randomized controlled trial of belatacept in first-time heart transplant recipients, in conjunction with gradual
tacrolimus withdrawal over 9-months to achieve a CNI-free immunosuppressive regimen (with mycophenolate
mofetil and prednisone). We hypothesize that the gradual approach to CNI withdrawal will promote quiescence
in graft-reactive T cells, thereby preventing rejection, inhibiting the development of DSA, and eliminating CNI-
related morbidity, together increasing survival after heart transplantation. The specific aims are:
Aim 1. Clinical trial to determine safety of belatacept in heart transplantation. We will perform a
multicenter clinical trial in EBV seropositive heart transplant recipients randomized 2:1 to receive belatacept
with gradual tacrolimus withdrawal (9-months) post-heart transplant or standard-of-care tacrolimus (control).
The objectives are to a) establish safety of the protocol based on stopping criteria defined by the composite of
historical control event rates and b) test efficacy for kidney sparing and DSA.
Aim 2. Impact of CNI withdrawal under costimulation blockade on graft-reactive immune responses.
We will serially analyze donor reactive, and autoantigen reactive T cell and B cell subsets using state-of-the-art
phenotypic and functional assays and will quantify DSA and autoantibodies. Results will be compared between
study arms and the kinetics of responses will be evaluated in individual subjects over time.
Aim 3. Other mechanistic/biomarker studies relevant to primary and secondary endpoints in the trial.
We will use molecular approaches to define differences in the intragraft response, explore markers of kidney
injury and fibrosis, and test donor derived cell-free DNA as a potential biomarker of impeding rejection during
CNI withdrawal. If successful, belatacept has the potential to transform the heart transplant field, removing
CNI-morbidities and preventing DSA as major barriers to improving long-term survival. The comprehensive
mechanistic studies will provide novel information, regardless of outcomes of the trial."
10845374,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Sam Payabvash, a Neuroradiologist and Assistant Professor of Radiology
at Yale University. Dr. Payabvash is a physician-scientist with specialized expertise at the intersection of
neuroscience, neuroimaging, and computer vision. His career goal is to find new treatment targets and to provide
personalized care for patients with cerebrovascular disease. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most
devastating cerebrovascular diseases with no effective treatment. To date, imaging markers of ICH risk-
stratification and outcome prediction have been subjective and descriptive in nature, leaving a large gap for
automated assessment of imaging feautres embedded in medical images. Preliminary results by Dr. Payabvash
have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan to apply automated feature extraction pipelines and machine
learning algorithms to harness the information in medical images for early risk-stratification and identification of
potential treatment targets in ICH. In this proposal, Dr. Payabvash will use detailed clinical and imaging data of
3,991 patients from NIH-funded clinical trials, online archives, and institutional registries at Yale, Tufts, and
University College of London. He will apply machine-learning algorithms to identify those imaging features of
brain hemorrhage on baseline head CT scan that are related to symptom severity at presentation (aim 1). Then,
he will use imaging features of hemorrhage to identify those patients who are at risk for early expansion of
hematoma (aim 2a), or surrounding edema (aim 2b). These two “modifiable” indicators of poor outcome are
considered potential treatment targets in ICH patients. Finally, he will combine admission clinical information and
imaging features to build a risk-stratification tool for long-term outcome prediction (aim 3). Under the expert
mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth (Chief of Neurocritical Care), Dr. Todd Constable (Director of MRI Research), and
Dr. Ronald Coifman (Professor of Mathematics), this K23 award will allow Dr. Payabvash to (1) identify and
address the most pressing issues in cerebrovascular disease with innovative neurogaming tools; (2) gain
expertise in advanced statistical analysis of brain scans; and (3) expand his knowledge in machine learning and
computer vision for assessment of medical images. Dr. Payabvash will receive didactic training in neuroimaging
statistical analysis, machine learning, deep neural networks, and computer vision. The proposed research and
career development plans draw on the wealth of resources available at Yale, including a Regional Coordinating
Center for the NIH StrokeNet, the Center for Research Computing; High Performance Computing services, and
cutting-edge image processing and analysis infrastructure. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Payabvash
will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in
advanced neuroimaging techniques and analysis aimed at improving the care of patients with cerebrovascular
disease."
10773628,"Over the past 15 years, new microscope technologies and methods for high throughput imaging
have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of datasets in 3
dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB
and for large volume electron microscope images of brain, can approach PB sizes. These file
sizes pose challenges for image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw
data and quantification. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML)
strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for
ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating
sets of scientific information. The rapidly accumulating digital library also affords a resource for
teaching and training, which is largely untapped.
We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) to transform each of these challenges, capitalizing
on natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and pattern recognition and, for scientific
communication, teaching and training, auditory processing to process language and localize
sounds. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have
established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first expand modern domain learning and
so-called meta-learning techniques in the ML field to analyze images with few iterations from
object counting to object tracking and tracing (Aim 1). Next, we will capitalize on new
technologies for cloud rendering to significantly mitigate the hardware costs for adoption of
syGlass (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide novel tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific
presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of
educational materials (Aim 3). The complexity of the brain offers a challenging testbed for
teaching and training. In each of these Aims, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the analysis of
the large data volumes, and communication of 3D and 4D data to colleagues and non-experts."
10931716,"ABSTRACT
Existing treatments for Parkinson’s disease (PD), which affects 10 million people worldwide, primarily augment
dopaminergic neurotransmission to provide symptomatic benefit. No current therapy can slow or stop the
progression of PD. We propose a drug discovery platform to develop small molecules targeting the parkin-USP30
mitophagy pathway, which represents a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis. Converging lines of
evidence from human genetics, tissue pathology and biochemical studies from sporadic PD patients, and animal
model studies indicate that deficits in Mitophagy are a modifiable contributor to PD pathogenesis. Specifically,
inhibition or knockdown of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP30 can enhance mitophagy in a variety of cell types
and infers neuroprotection in two fruit fly models (pink1 deficiency and paraquat toxicity). However, studies
examining neurodegeneration in larger animals such as rodents are an unfilled gap in knowledge that should be
addressed prior to development of USP30 inhibitors as therapeutics for PD. In the proposed Aims, we will test
the hypothesis that USP30 inhibitor small molecules will protect against neurodegeneration induced by a
mitochondrial toxin MPTP, or a-synuclein preformed fibrils – both models with links to Parkinson’s disease and
mitophagy. Our preliminary data demonstrate that we have generated a series of small molecules that potently
and selectively inhibit USP30 activity in vitro, and demonstrate cellular activity without cytotoxicity in differentiated
neuronal cell lines. Top compounds have good in vitro ADME properties and a lead and back up compound have
been identified with excellent rat and mouse plasma and brain PK profiles which place us in a unique position to
examine the proposed hypothesis. If successful, the studies proposed in this application will justify further
investment toward development of our small molecules through Investigational New Drug filing (IND)-enabling
studies, out-license, or partnership with big pharma or biotech for further clinical development."
10765721,"Despite prevalent use of anti-platelet and anti-lipid therapies, stroke remains the third major cause of death
and is the leading cause of adult disability in the US with an estimated cost in the range of $34 billion
annually. Approximately 20% of the annual 795,000 stroke patients die within one year and 15-30% are
permanently disabled. Antiplatelet therapy is mainly used for primary prevention of acute ischemic stroke in
cerebrovascular disease. Bioactive fatty acids are a new class of molecular targets that hold great
therapeutic potential because of their diverse role as signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and
inflammation. The oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-LOX results in the production of a number of bioactive
lipids including the metabolite 12(S)-HETE. The lipid receptor GPR31, an orphan class A GPCR, is a 12(S)-
HETE receptor recently shown to be involved in inflammatory signaling. We recently discovered that GPR31
mediates 12(S)-HETE prothrombotic signaling in platelets and promotes glutamate-induced oxidative
toxicity in neuronal cells. Therefore, we propose that targeting GPR31 may provide a therapeutic path
towards development of a safe and effective antiplatelet therapy that is coupled with secondary
neuroprotective effects for mitigating against the acute neurologic sequela of stroke to provide a more
effective and safer alternative option or adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy. We have recently succeeded in
identifying the first effective GPR31 antagonist using our cell-penetrating, membrane-tethered, Pepducin
technology to be validated in these preclinical IND-enabling studies as an anti-platelet and anti-stroke
agent. We show here that this i3-loop derived GPR31 lipopeptide has potent antiplatelet activity and nearly
completely suppresses arterial thrombosis without an effect on hemostasis in mice. Preliminary data with
the GPR310 pepducin shows a highly significant reduction in stroke infarct area in mice similar to the
protective effect of Gpr31-deficiency. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct neuroprotective effect of
the GPR310 pepducin on HT22 neuronal cells subjected to glutamate mediated oxidative stress. The goal
of this Phase 2 STTR project is to develop the GPR310 pepducin as a collaborative effort between Oasis
Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA), Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) that would provide a robust IND data
package required to advance the initial commercial development of the first GPR31 inhibitor as a dual
antiplatelet, anti-stroke drug. This drug development program would establish the scientific merit of the
GPR31 target by accomplishing the major milestones at the end of 2 years of GLP safety/pharmacology
and efficacy in stroke models ± thrombolytic therapy to support a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial."

Kennedy’s disease, also known as spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease caused by genetic polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal domain
(NTD) of the androgen receptor (AR). Recent research has shown that the mutant AR protein
misfolds, aggregates, and abnormally interacts with other proteins, leading to androgen-
dependent lower motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy. Currently, there are
no treatments available to slow, stop or even reverse the progression of SBMA, therefore, the
unmet medical need is high to discover novel therapeutic agents. The AR pathway is a very
important area being studied in SBMA. Experimental studies for the treatment of SBMA have
focused on interaction of the AR with testosterone. Removing testosterone via castration in animal
models appears to be protective and restores some lost function. AR knockout in SBMA patient-
derived stem cells differentiated into neurons reverses the neurotoxic effects of the mutant AR.
This led to the use of anti-androgenic therapies for SBMA treatment. Our awarded Phase 1 SBIR
grant to evaluate our NTD-binding selective AR antagonists and degraders (DAARIs) in preclinical
models of SBMA has provided strong in vivo data that support the submission of this Phase 2
application to continue the preclinical development of ONCT-505 a potential SBMA therapy.
Our objective is to generate certain data for ONCT-505 that will ultimately support the submission
of an investigational new drug (IND)-application. ONCT-505 has been studied in various
preclinical models of AR-dependent diseases, including SBMA and advanced prostate cancer.
Importantly, ONCT-505, unlike any other molecule targeting the AR, binds to the AR activation
function-1 (AF-1) domain in the NTD and leads to signaling antagonism and ultimately AR protein
degradation via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. ONCT-505 is orally bioavailable with
pharmacokinetic (PK) and drug-like properties suitable for drug development and demonstrated
efficacy in SBMA preclinical models better than surgical castration. The molecule did not show
overt toxicity up to 200 times the ED50 (effective dose of 50% observed efficacy) in pilot toxicology
studies and also lacks cross-reactivity with other proteins. These properties make ONCT-505 an
ideal candidate for further evaluation as potential small molecule therapeutic for patients suffering
from SBMA.
Successful completion of the outlined studies will result in a clinical drug candidate with
demonstrated preclinical efficacy, well-documented safety profile, and scalable GMP-compatible
manufacturing process."
11143961,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dehydration among older adults costs billions of US healthcare dollars every year. While not always the primary focus of
care, dehydration is a pervasive comorbidity in hospitalizations and deaths of older adult patients. Dehydration is of vital
importance, especially among vulnerable older adults because: (1) Older persons can have additional difficulty monitoring
their own fluid intake (2) existing technologies do not present a consistent, actionable mechanism for measuring
dehydration in home settings and other areas where older adults live independently. Hydration measurement techniques
available to care providers today are either inconsistent, laborious, inaccurate, or not feasible.
Dehydration is an ambulatory-care-sensitive condition and is preventable and reversible. Health care outcomes can be
improved and hospital expenditures reduced or prevented through home monitoring of hydation, changes in health
behaviors of older adults and the rendering prompt, appropriate care.
TritonX has created a wearable sensor based on bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) techniques to measure personal
hydration in real time with sufficient accuracy to assess significant fluid changes in the human body. Our value
proposition is to track the changes in the body fluids in real time and to alert the caretakers/patient if the hydration level of
the patient falls below a certain threshold.
In this STTR Fast Track Application we propose to, in Phase 1, determine the ideal user experience, device settings and
health care communication needs when conducting continuous monitoring of fluid levels among older adults in their
homes. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of continuous home
monitoring of fluid levels in a cohort of vulnerable older adult patients seen in the emergency care setting.
The successful outcome of this study will include evidence for the effectiveness of the home, wearable hydration
monitoring device, data necessary for the FDA 510(k) and related regulatory processes and substantial enhancements to
both our knowledge of older adult needs and device functionality."
10836350,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In species that learn vocalizations, social experience acts on genetically encoded
forebrain circuits to enable vocal imitation. Critical periods limit when this social experience can
influence the development and function of neural circuits required for vocal learning. In
songbirds, HVC is a necessary song neurocircuit component to form a song memory from the
social experience of hearing an adult vocal model (“tutoring”). Yet, HVC is also necessary as a
premotor region after the critical period. It is not well understood how the tutoring experience
acts on HVC to allow this dual sensory and motor function. Our single-nucleus RNA-sequencing
results demonstrate that the proportion of HVC’s projection neurons change throughout
development. During the sensory critical period, HVC neurons that project to the auditory region
and basal ganglia pathway are proportionally more than those that project to the motor pathway.
I hypothesize that HVC uses these distinct cell types to function as a sensory region early in
development prior to the maturation of its motor function. I therefore expect that the two former
projection neuron types experience the most genetic and electrophysiological changes related
to learning from the social tutoring experience compared to the latter projection neuron type. To
test this, I will examine single-cell epigenomic and transcriptional changes from tutoring
experience to measure changes in immediate early genes and genes related to plasticity and
learning. I will also use optogenetic circuit mapping to measure the changes in synaptic strength
from tutoring experience."

The overarching theme of this proposal is to apply robust and reliable reaction mechanisms to improve the
efficiency of forming C–C bonds adjacent to alcohol or amine functionality. Among the most common strategies
to these products is the addition of a Grignard reagent (or other carbon nucleophile) to a ketone or ketimine
electrophile, but the broad applicability of these methods is limited by (1) the poor compatibility of organometallic
nucleophiles with many functional groups common to drug scaffolds and (2) significant limitations inherent to
migratory insertion mechanisms, such as sluggish or undesired reactivity. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that α-heteroatom radical generating processes can be implemented in tandem with nickel cross-coupling for
C–H functionalization to install hindered stereocenters. The emergence of nickel catalyzed cross-electrophile
coupling strategies has provided novel and complementary reactivity to traditional cross-couplings and the
controlled generation of organic free radicals is central to the development of new methods in this area.
Intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms proceed at a higher rate than nickel capture of alkyl
radicals, and should be an appropriate approach to generate the radical. The Specific Aims of this proposal are:
(1) development of a 1,5-HAT and nickel C–C bond forming cascade to synthesize tertiary alcohols from readily
available secondary alcohols and a traceless auxiliary group; (2) a strategy in which α-heteroatom radicals
formed through 1,5-HAT are intercepted for nickel facilitated C–C bond formation to prepare functionalized amino
alcohols and amino acids; and (3) an approach for Csp3–Csp3 coupling of α-heteroatom radicals to primary
radicals is presented, in which cross-selectivity should be driven by radical stability differences. All three of these
Aims can be adopted into enantioconvergent reactions by employing chiral ligands to generate stereocenters,
which is highly desirable in the context of pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. The development and
synthesis of drug candidates is limited by the reactions available to make them, and the strategies described in
this proposal will facilitate Csp2–Csp3 and Csp3–Csp3 bond formation at α-heteroatom carbon centers, an
important motif found in pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. The continued improvement of catalytic
conditions that employ a large pool of coupling partners to prepare sterically congested alcohols and amines will
be of significant interest to both academia and industry, and will enable broader chemical space accessible in
future drug discovery endeavors."

Synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), are a growing
health crisis, affecting over 1 million people in the United States and an estimated 10 million people globally.
Synucleinopathies are caused by accumulation of the protein α-synuclein (α-syn) into unnatural fibrils in the brain
and can manifest with motor symptoms, cognitive symptoms, or a combination of the two. There are currently
no effective treatments to cure or prevent synucleinopathies, in large part because there is no clear cause for
disease. There are many identified genetic and environmental risk factors associated with synucleinopathies,
but the context in which these factors lead to disease is still unknown. In addition to direct mutations to SNCA,
the gene that encodes α-syn, mutations to GBA and APOE are well established risk factors and have been
shown to increase α-syn aggregation. However, none of these risk factors are great predictors of disease on
their own, suggesting unknown genetic and environmental interactions likely influence the initiation, severity, and
clinical outcomes of α-syn pathology. In this proposal, I focus on how both cell type and genotype interact with
each other to modulate α-syn pathology severity. I hypothesize that α-syn pathology is precipitated by epistatic
interactions between genetic factors that disrupt homeostasis in different cell types and leaves dopaminergic
neurons vulnerable to deleterious α-syn pathology and neurodegeneration. I will investigate this hypothesis using
two independent, complementary approaches to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate
α-syn phenotypes. First, I will couple GBA knockdown with SNCA-triplication, wild-type, and knockout cell lines.
There is a clear link between GBA mutations and α-syn aggregation, but how these proteins connect is still
unknown. I will use high-content imaging with genetically encoded fluorescent markers to quantify lysosomal and
mitochondrial dynamics in live cells. This will reveal how GBA responds to different α-syn dosages and how that
affects cellular homeostasis. Second, I will leverage isogenic lines containing APOE allelic variants and GBA
knockdown. GBA and APOE are involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting a putative link between lipid
metabolism disruption and α-syn pathology, although there is no published connection between the two proteins.
I will use next generation genomic sequencing and proteomic approaches to determine the interacting effects
between SNCA, GBA, and APOE allelic variants on α-syn pathology severity. Completion of this aim will uncover
whether GBA and APOE are acting through converging or independent pathways, expanding our knowledge of
the network that contributes to disease pathology. By coupling multiple genetic risk factors into a multi-cell type
model, I will pioneer new technology and approaches to dissect epistatic mechanisms that influence α-syn
pathology. These insights will guide us in developing new therapeutic approaches, enabling earlier detection,
treatment, and prevention of synucleinopathies."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a smoking-related disease that is end-stage at diagnosis, with a median
survival of 3.8 years. Current treatments slow the future progression of IPF but do not reverse the disease. Thus,
there is an important need to detect patients who are at risk of developing IPF and may benefit from earlier
initiation of anti-fibrotic medications. Recent work has validated changes in the lung parenchyma on chest
computed tomography (CT) scans of smokers that represent early pulmonary fibrosis. These parenchymal
changes, either detected visually and called interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), or through an automated image
analysis tool developed by Dr. Choi’s lab called quantitative interstitial abnormalities (QIA), are associated with
poor lung function, exercise limitations, and increased mortality. However, QIA caught at a point in time likely
represents heterogeneous disease, encompassing both the non-progressive and transient processes that are
caught on CT, and the clinically meaningful early smoking-related disease that will eventually progress to IPF.
Radiomics may enable the characterization of, and increase specificity of, QIA phenotypes associated with IPF.
Radiomics analyses use high-throughput computing to measure many features that are already available but not
typically measured in CT scans, including measurements and statistics about the textures, shapes, gray levels
within regions of interest, and relationships amongst voxels. Radiomics may provide a novel, specific tool to
stratify disease severity and predict disease progression of early pulmonary fibrosis.
Dr. Choi will use radiomics features to distinguish heterogeneous phenotypes of smoking-related lung injury. In
Aim 1, she will characterize the radiomics signatures of smokers with early pulmonary fibrosis (QIA) at risk for
worse clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, she will move her focus to identifying the patients at the earliest stage of lung
injury. She will characterize the radiomics signatures of smokers with visually normal CTs at risk for progression
to early pulmonary fibrosis and worse clinical outcomes.
Dr. Choi will perform this work within the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of the Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr.
George Washko, an expert in quantitative medical imaging analysis and co-director of the Applied Chest Imaging
Laboratory at BWH. With her mentors and Scientific Advisory Committee, Dr. Choi has developed a training plan
to gain proficiency in big data preparation and analysis, machine learning algorithms, advanced statistical
methods, and programming; to maintain and deepen her understanding of pulmonary fibrosis and smoking-
related lung disease; and to hone her skills in scientific manuscript preparation, grant-writing, and effective
communication. Dr. Choi’s long-term goal is to become a physician-scientist that combines her clinical expertise
in pulmonary medicine with advanced technical and research expertise in data science, in order to leverage big
data for the improved detection and treatment of lung diseases."

 Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) is an emerging MRI technique whereby deuterated substrates and
their metabolic products are imaged in vivo. A primary application is the study of energy metabolism, a
fundamental process for virtually all cells in the body. In particular, glucose (Glc) metabolism plays a critical
role in cancer, with two key metrics of tumor metabolism being total glucose consumption and the relative
fraction of Glc undergoing glycolysis (GLY) versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In contrast to normal
tissues, most cancers exhibit a preponderance of GLY over OXPHOS. Known as the Warburg effect or, more
generally metabolic reprogramming, these alterations are particularly pronounced in glioma and other brain
tumors. Elevated GLY in high-grade brain tumors has been shown to be a marker of tumor growth and
aggressiveness. From a therapeutic perspective, studies strongly support that this Warburg phenotype is
necessary and sufficient for the cancer process, which provides the framework of a highly novel therapeutic
strategy targeted at affecting these metabolic pathways. We contend that clinical translation is presently
impeded not so much by a lack of agents, but by the difficulty in measuring these fundamental aspects of
tumor metabolism in vivo.
 Of the available imaging techniques, 18F-FDG-PET is well-established for imaging glucose uptake, whereas
robust in vivo measurements of GLY and OXPHOS are considerably more challenging. Triple 15O-PET can be
used to assess oxygen consumption (and hence OXPHOS) but is clinically problematic due to the 2-min half-
life of 15O and the challenges of coordinating multiple inhaled radioactive gases. MRI of hyperpolarized 13C-
labeled pyruvate has been shown capable of assessing tumor GLY/OXPHOS ratios; however, this technique is
very expensive with limited availability and unique challenges. More recently, the feasibility of using
conventional 2H MRSI of deuterated glucose to measure both GLY and OXPHOS has been successfully
demonstrated. Given the ubiquity of 3T scanners, we contend that 3T DMI would have maximal clinical impact,
and initial results for the human brain reported at 4T, in combination with our own 3T DMI data, indicate limited
spatial resolution, low SNR, and correspondingly long scan times are the primary limitations. This technical
development project will address these challenges by enhancing DMI via the incorporation of multimodal
information. Noting that 1H MRI and FDG-PET share significant mutual anatomic and metabolic information
with DMI, we propose to significantly enhance 3T DMI using signal processing and machine learning
approaches analogous to techniques using MRI to enhance FDG-PET resolution and SNR. The overall goal is
to demonstrate enhanced DMI acquisitions and image processing pipelines for maximal clinical impact, with
the initial application being the imaging of the Warburg effect in brain tumors."

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndromes (IC/BPS) is a debilitating condition with loss of bladder control and
severe bladder pain on bladder filling. Mechanisms underlying IC/BPS are poorly understood. Compelling studies
show that the brainstem via direct projection to the spinal cord can directly modulate nociceptive processing and
bladder function. In our preliminary studies, we have identified distinct populations of the brainstem neurons that
project to the spinal cord. Here we will determine the precise roles of these distinct brainstem neurons in the
pathology of IC/BPS. We will determine if IC/BPS leads to maladaptive changes in these distinct populations.
We will use optogenetics, anatomical tracing, in vivo calcium imaging, slice electrophysiology and RNA
sequencing to determine if IC/BPS leads to functional changes at the cellular and systems level in these circuits.
Do these changes drive IC/BPS? Does reversing these maladaptive changes relieve IC/BPS? Together, this
work will reveal the specific roles for this neural circuits in IC/BPS. This rich information can have broad
implications for potential new direction in designing safer therapeutic drugs in treatment of the IC/BPS."
10811652,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K23 award will support the candidate’s training and development for an independent clinical research
career focused on understanding mechanisms of mind-body exercise interventions to optimize them for health
behavior promotion in medical populations. BACKGROUND. Rates of physical inactivity are alarmingly high,
particularly in patients with cardiometabolic conditions. Mind-body exercise interventions are promising for
promoting physical activity because they engage key health behavior change processes. While the
multidimensionality of mind-body exercise interventions is a strength, it also poses challenges for
understanding how individual therapeutic components engage health behavior change processes.
Disentangling the relative contribution of therapeutic components is critical for optimizing mind-body exercise
interventions for physical activity promotion. SPECIFIC AIMS. Using metabolic syndrome as a model, the
proposed study aims to: (1) refine the content and procedures of a factorial design to dismantle two mind-body
exercise components, exercise and mindful attention, via feedback from focus groups with sedentary patients
with metabolic syndrome and an interdisciplinary expert panel; (2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
the factorial design in a pilot RCT; and (3) explore within-group patterns of change in self-regulation,
cardiopulmonary physiology, and physical activity levels across three timepoints. TRAINING. The candidate
will receive training in three areas to develop expertise critical to her overall career goals: (1) optimization-
focused clinical trial design and implementation; (2) qualitative research and longitudinal data analysis
(mediation); and (3) cardiopulmonary physiology research. These training aims will be supported by vast
institutional resources, as well as coursework, trainings, research seminars/meetings, and scientific
conferences. MENTORSHIP. The candidate will be supported by an expert mentoring team: Gloria Yeh, MD,
MPH (primary mentor), Peter Wayne, PhD (co-mentor), Long Ngo, PhD (collaborator), Chung-Kang Peng, PhD
(collaborator), Daniel Forman, MD (consultant), Erick Loucks, PhD (consultant), and Karen Kilgore, PhD
(consultant). IMPACT. In line with NCCIH priorities, skills acquired through this K23 proposal will promote an
independent research career focused on understanding how mind-body exercise interventions promote health
and optimizing these interventions to foster health promotion. While initial studies will focus on metabolic
syndrome and physical activity engagement, findings from this project will allow the candidate to develop a
model to study mind-body exercise for other medical populations known to struggle with initiating and
sustaining healthy behaviors. This K23 award will provide preliminary data for a R61/R33 application to
examine relative contributions of mind-body exercise components on health behavior change processes and
whether changes in these processes lead to downstream improvements in physical activity engagement."

Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause disease in human and animal populations
Chlamydia trachomatis is the major cause of both bacterial sexually transmitted disease and infectious
blindness in the world. Despite great strides over the past decade, tools for genetic study and manipulation of
Chlamydia spp. remain severely limited. This proposal will develop new and powerful genetic tools including
tightly negatively regulated promoter expression systems, a Tn7-based single chromosomal insertion
transgene system, and application of the latter to build new, smaller shuttle plasmids for transformation.
 Specific Aim 1 – Development of a tightly negatively regulated inducible promoter for Chlamydia.
This aim will provide one of the key missing tools in the repertoire of genetic tools for Chlamydia: a tightly
negatively regulated, inducible, and titratable promoter for performing expression / overexpression studies. In
bacterial physiology studies, it is important to be able to express and overexpress cloned genes in a mutant or
wild type genetic background. One also must be able to tightly repress the cloned gene to avoid undesirable
phenotypes associated with leaky expression of the cloned gene. The two subaims will design and test
inducible promoter systems derived from two well-established Escherichia coli systems: the lac operon and the
arabinose operon. Both systems are tightly repressed in the absence of inducer and rapidly upregulated when
inducer is present. Our rigorous validation plan will use three reporter genes to measure promoter activity
in the presence and absence of inducer. The lac operon promoters will allow us to develop a range of
promoters of varying induction strength and induction ratios to provide flexibility for future genetic studies.
 Specific Aim 2 – Development of a chromosomal Tn7 transgene insertion system for single copy
gene complementation studies in Chlamydia. Shuttle plasmids used in Chlamydia complementation
studies are based on the native Chlamydia plasmid, which is present at 7.6 copies per genome. The major
shortcoming of expressing a cloned gene from a multi-copy plasmid is that even low copies of the plasmid may
lead to non-physiological levels of gene expression and aberrant phenotypes that complicate
interpretation of the complementation results. The Tn7 transgene system provides high frequency, site-
specific, single copy chromosomal insertion of any gene with the additional advantage of removing the
need for antibiotic selection for transgene maintenance. We will adapt the Tn7 transgene system to Chlamydia.
Our proposal includes a rigorous strategy to test the transgene system and plans to optimize the system by
selection for transposase mutants that more efficiently recognize the chlamydial Tn7 attachment site. We
will apply the Tn7 transgene system to build and validate new, smaller shuttle plasmids, which should
improve transformation efficiencies. We will make all tools developed in this proposal available to the research
community. Thus, successful completion of these aims will enhance genetic studies in Chlamydia."

 This K23 project will prepare the Principal Investigator, Justin M. Canada, PhD, to develop as an
independent clinical/translational researcher who is expert in a novel form of cardiopulmonary exercise stress
measurement – cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – to identify factors that reduce peak
oxygen consumption (VO2) in patients with heart failure. Peak VO2 reflects peak exercise capacity, a prime
determinant of outcomes among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). This noninvasive methodology
does not require intravenous contrast or ionizing radiation, eliminating possible side effects among patients in
poor health. It also accurately measures exercise-associated cardiac output—a fundamental contributor to
overall exercise capacity—that can be targeted with therapeutic interventions to improve overall peak exercise
capacity.
 This project is a collaborative multi-disciplinary effort among oncologists, exercise physiologists, biomedical
engineers, and cardiovascular experts to address an important issue in the emerging field of cardio-oncology.
The proposal focuses on patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) for
hematologic malignancies. Treatment-associated reductions in peak VO2 can exclude candidates from life-
saving HCT. Among survivors of hematologic malignancies, reduced peak VO2 is associated with impaired
quality of life and elevated risk of death not related to relapse. At present, there is no reliable method to identify
those at risk for these serious adverse events.
 In addition to a strong, supportive environment that includes international experts, the largest HCT program
in Virginia, and state-of-the-art equipment co-located within the Cancer Center that serves the HCT
community, the proposal is buttressed by highly supportive preliminary data and a robust career development
plan for Dr. Canada. This plan provides mentored training in the translational fundamentals of MRI theory:
conduct, interpretation, and MRI application in cardiovascular and cardio-oncology clinical management. This
includes expertise in the technical aspects, analysis, interpretation, and utilization of an innovative exercise
stress-associated cardiovascular MRI technique to discern the mechanism of reduced exercise capacity in
other heart failure syndromes.
 This patient-oriented mentored research training plan incorporates a highly innovative technique and an
excellent training environment to develop and test a methodology that identifies the causes of reductions in
peak exercise capacity, a primary determinant of HCT outcomes. The outstanding mentor team will guide the
Candidate’s progress in professional milestones (publications and presentations) and oversee his continued
exposure to responsible conduct of research training. At completion of this K23, Dr. Canada will be well-
qualified to contribute meaningfully to an emerging field of growing research interest."
10841679,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social cognition, and social attachment in particular, is often significantly disrupted in age-related
neuropsychiatric disease. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by disruptions in social attachment
behavior and loss of empathy early in the course of the disease. We currently lack a mechanistic understanding
of the neurobiology of attachment behavior or its disruption in disease and have no interventions for these
profoundly impairing symptoms, despite their potential as early diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The candidate
for this K08 Mentored Career Development Award is a physician scientist and psychiatrist at the University of
California, San Francisco. Her long-term career goal is to understand the impact of aging and neurodegenerative
disease on the neurobiology of social behavior. The overall objective of the proposed research plan is to elucidate
the molecular and neural circuit pathways mediating social attachment changes in FTD. The candidate proposes
to use the prairie vole, a unique model organism that forms long-term adult pair bonds, to understand the
neurobiology of social attachment. In her preliminary work, she has used molecular genetic tools to knock out
progranulin (Grn), one of the most common genetic causes of FTD, in the vole. This work represents an
innovative and novel approach to studying attachment deficits in dementia. She proposes to first examine the
effects of loss of genes relevant to social behavior and to FTD, the oxytocin receptor (OxtR) and Grn, using both
behavioral and transcriptomic profiling with age. She will then test the hypothesis that loss of OxtR and Grn
converge on specific neural circuits responsible for the presentation of social deficits, using in vivo calcium
imaging and viral tracing methods to map patterns of neural activity and connectivity. The proposed research is
significant because it seeks to mechanistically link the risk genes associated with neurodegenerative disease to
the neural circuit changes and social attachment disruptions characteristic of these diseases. This proposal
presents a five-year research career development program designed to provide a foundation for an independent
research program. The specific career development goals outlined in this application include training in systems
neuroscience, advanced sequencing and bioinformatics methods, and in translational neurodegenerative
disease research. These skills build on the candidate's prior experience in neuroendocrine signaling and its role
in aging biology and neurodegenerative disease. The primary mentorship team (Drs. Manoli, Miller, and
Ingraham) has expertise in molecular genetics, systems neurophysiology, and translational FTD research. Other
key contributors and collaborators provide expertise in vole behavior (Dr. Bales), transcriptomics and
bioinformatics (Dr. Willsey), and comparative genomics (Dr. Yokoyama). The direct training in research
methodology and career support will allow the candidate to transition to a career as an independent investigator
in aging and brain health."
10763012,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Genome-scale DNA sequencing has revolutionized the practice of precision medicine, at dramatically reduced
cost. It is possible today to sequence an entire human genome in roughly one day; however, bioinformatic
analysis typically takes days or weeks, and has emerged as the major bottleneck for successfully utilizing
genome sequencing in time-critical applications, e.g. for identifying the genomic vulnerabilities of a patient’s
tumor for rational cancer treatment selection within a clinically relevant timeframe. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to dramatically speed up genomic analysis algorithms via heterogeneous computing
techniques. Here we will focus on one critical aspect of genomic analysis, i.e. variant calling, and set the
ambitious goal of completing the analysis of a 60X-coverage Illumina whole genome sequencing dataset in under
10 minutes, far faster than the current state of the art. Although here applied to only one analysis task,
accomplishing such a high degree of acceleration would demonstrate that the techniques we are developing in
this proposal are also generalizable across many other genomic analysis tasks. Our approach is to first
accelerate the most widely reusable software components, to maximize value for the genomic analysis tool
developer community, who will then be able to integrate these components into their own tools.
With these reusable software components, we will accelerate the FreeBayes variant caller tool. FreeBayes is a
widely used germline variant and somatic mutation detection tool, and therefore acceleration will benefit a large
user audience. This software was developed in our own laboratory, and therefore we are intimately familiar with
its algorithms and code base, positioning us for success in this exploratory project. If successful, our technique
will be applicable for accelerating many, currently time-consuming analysis tasks. As a result, analysts will be
able to finish sophisticated data processing tasks within minutes, as part of their interactive analysis session
rather than a batched background process, and complete manual result review immediately after; rendering the
complete analysis process sufficiently fast for time-critical clinical applications."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB); although a treatable
disease TB remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This in large is driven by the
unparalleled increase in anti-mycobacterial drug resistance. Approximately 10 million people fell ill with TB in
2019, where 500,000 were new rifampicin resistant cases and 78% of rifampicin cases were multi-drug
resistant; compromising the most effective first-line drugs. In line with recent WHO guidance, the majority of
these patients are treated with all-oral short-course treatment incorporating bedaquiline and other novel

DR-TB treatment regimens. Current diagnostic assays do not incorporate resistance detection to these new
drugs, largely as a result of our incomplete understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms mediating
resistance. As a result, a combination of genotypic and phenotypic techniques is required to monitor
resistance to these new drugs. Reporter mycobacteriophage assays represent a promising approach for
deriving phenotypic data in a replication-independent system, maintaining high sensitivity while reducing the
time to result attendant with growth-based methods. We created a TM4 phage vector that delivers a gene
cassette of the Nluc BRET-GeNL nanoluciferase reporter enzyme. The BRET-GeNL nanoluciferase phage
was tested on a range of auxotrophic and virulent clinical M. tuberculosis strains, assessing cellular limit of
detection and compatibility with drug susceptibility testing on a wide range of antimycobacterial drugs. We
found that following a preculture period, we could identify drug susceptibility consistent with WHO-endorsed
treatment concentrations to a suite of first-line and second-line drugs as well as novel and repurposed drugs
(bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid). The overall objective of this research is to validate the
nanoluciferase phage for detection of resistance to novel anti-mycobacterial agents, will be accomplished in
two Aims. Aim 1 will establish the utility of the assay in paucibacillary conditions and mixed infection. Aim2
will derive correlations between established minimum inhibitory values around critical concentrations and
nanoluciferase fluorescence intensity measures, and validate these cut points in a established prospective
cohort study of MDR-TB treatment. An exploratory sub Aim will trial minimally processed sputum rather than
MTB culture for MTB detection and drug susceptibility testing. The proposed work will provide additional
validation on the BRET-GeNL nanoluciferase phage system and offer a quantitative phenotypic reference
method and complement to genotypic methods for diagnosis and antibiotic susceptibility testing."
10841391,"While sexual dimorphisms have been reported in the adipose tissue’s metabolic adaptation to environmental
temperature or nutritional challenges, the sex-specific mechanisms regulating adipose tissue’s responses are
not fully understood. There is increasing evidence demonstrating that the female sex hormone, estrogen, plays
a vital role in sex dimorphic control of adipose tissue metabolism. We and others have consistently shown that
central estrogen signaling mediated by estrogen receptor α (ERα) increases sympathetic activity, promotes
brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, and diminishes excessive
adiposity. ERα is abundantly expressed in the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (vlVMH), a
sex-dimorphic structure and the only ERα site in the brain that directly modulates BAT thermogenesis. Despite
the abundant evidence supporting the role of ERαvlVMH in energy expenditure and metabolic function, it is still
unclear whether ERαvlVMH-originated networks respond to environmental challenges, subsequently regulating
adipose tissue metabolic adaptations. Here, we aim to test whether estrogen-initiated ERαvlVMH signaling and
its downstream circuit contribute to sex dimorphic regulation of adipose tissue metabolic adaptation. The first
aim is to determine if ERαvlVMH sex-dimorphically modulates BAT and WAT metabolism in response to
temperature or nutritional challenge. The second aim is to determine if the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) relays
ERαvlVMH neuron signals to adipose tissue to modulate metabolic adaptation. Results from these studies will
advance our current understanding of adipose tissue plasticity and adaptation in general. Further, our studies
will reveal the brain ERα-originated networks that respond to temperature or nutritional challenges and initiate
subsequent changes in adipose tissue metabolism."
10806968,"Project Summary: This study will address the need for motivational strategies to achieve therapeutic levels of
task-repetition in upper extremity rehabilitation post-stroke. To this end, we are investigating optimal strategies
for utilizing music to increase motor activity, improve affect and increase functional activity in brain areas
related to motor recovery post-stroke. While most empirical studies of music-based interventions utilize fixed
music-playing tasks in which participants play a specified music sequence, the clinical practice of music
therapy involves improvisation, allowing the music to be adjusted in the moment to reflect the emotional, social
and physical needs of participants. We have therefore designed a study to characterize the effect of
improvisation within music-based interventions for upper extremity rehabilitation. In Aim 1 we will characterize
the motor, affective and physiological correlates of music improvisation for adults with post-stroke hemiparesis.
We hypothesize that the increased improvisation will be associated with increased motor activity (measured by
accelerometry) and increased affect (measured by self-report surveys following each condition and
physiological arousal). In Aim 2 we will assess the neural mechanisms of music improvisation by using fMRI.
We hypothesize that increased affect and motor output will be supported by increased functional connectivity
between core reward, motivation and emotion-related subcortical regions and cortical motor and frontal areas.
These findings will lay the foundation for optimal musi-based interventions that capitalize on improvisation to
maximize motor recovery and minimize attrition rate."

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), like depression, are common early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and correlate
with a faster decline in patients. NPS and cognitive deficits in AD have been linked with the accumulation of tau
protein. Two independent studies associated an allelic variant in the 51kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP51)
with increased risk for depression in AD. FKBP51 also regulates tau accumulation and toxicity to nerve cells. We
will use transgenic mouse models to determine if either removing or inhibiting FKBP51 in mice will be protective
against tau accumulation. We will also study whether mice that have this risk variant in combination with tau
accumulation are more vulnerable to NPS. The critical knowledge gained through this work will add to our
understanding of the role of FKBP51 in regulating tau pathogenesis especially during disease progression. This
work will have a positive impact in AD research as we will further validate FKBP51 as a target and characterize
the molecular landscape associated with vulnerability to NPS in tauopathies."

 Perianal fistulas (PAF) occur in 30-40% of Crohn’s disease patients and their complications lead to a
significant impairment in quality of life. Current treatments are effective in less than 50% of cases. The overall
objective of this proposed study is to develop a biostimulatory nanofiber-hydrogel composite (NHC) plug to
promote tissue healing and to test its efficacy to repair PAF in clinically relevant animal models. Previous work
from the Mao and Selaru labs laid the foundation for this study. Specifically, we have established novel rodent
and swine models of PAF that faithfully recapitulate the biology of PAF in patients. In parallel, we have developed
a first-generation injectable biodegradable nanofiber-hydrogel composite (NHC) from poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL)
nanofibers covalently bonded to hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel; and demonstrated its ability to deliver adipose
stem cells (ADSCs) and repair PAF by conditioning inflammatory responses, permitting host cell infiltration, and
facilitating angiogenesis and progressive remodeling. Building on these preliminary results, we plan to engineer
a second generation NHC plug with enhanced mechanical strength and integrity as an off-the-shelf device and
optimize its biostimulatory activities to induce more favorable cellular responses governing fistula healing. We
hypothesize that this NHC plug with structurally, mechanically, and biofunctionally optimized features will
effectively promote angiogenesis and soft tissue restoration; and serve as a carrier for ADSCs and ADSC-
derived exosomes to further improve the PAF tissue healing. To test this hypothesis and demonstrate its
translational potential, we will pursue three specific aims (1) develop a collagen nanofiber-based NHC plug with
optimal mechanical properties and porous structure for ease of implantation to support perianal fistula healing,
(2) utilize a rat model to evaluate the efficacy for PAF healing when used alone or in conjunction with ADSCs or
ADSC-derived exosomes, and elucidate the pro-regenerative mechanism by assessing cell infiltration,
angiogenesis, extracellular matrix deposition, and tissue remodeling, and (3) utilize a swine model to
demonstrate the synergistic effect in tissue remodeling by combining the optimized NHC plug with ADSC-derived
exosomes. This study will deliver a translatable off-the-shelf biomimetic NHC microporous plugs for the delivery
of ADSC-derived exosomes capable of promoting soft tissue remodeling and healing for PAF repair."

Tryptophan (Trp) catabolism is a complex pathway that generates over fifty metabolites in a cell-specific manner.
Besides being the precursor of serotonin and melatonin, tryptophan generates a cascade of metabolites known
as kynurenines. Kynurenine metabolites are regarded as one of the most powerful mediators of immune
regulation. The thrust of this application stems from our original observations that: (i) lymphatic endothelial cells
(LEC) and dendritic cells (DCs) secrete a previously unidentified biogenic amine, 3HKA, which derives from a
lateral pathway of Trp catabolism, whose function is currently unknown; (ii) 3HKA exhibits a clear anti-
inflammatory profile by inhibiting the STAT1/NF-κΒ pathway in both mouse and human dendritic cells (DCs) with
a consequent decrease in the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines; most notably, IL-6,
IL12p70 and TNFα; (iii) in vivo, 3HKA exerts protective effects in the experimental model of psoriasis by
decreasing skin thickness, erythema, scaling and fissuring. In a model of nephrotoxic lupus, 3HKA improved
proteinuria and serum urea nitrogen, overall ameliorating the immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and renal
dysfunction. As such, the ultimate goal of this application is to fully characterize the biological activity of 3HKA.
In Aim 1, a series of biochemical and biophysical analyses will be employed to identify the enzyme responsible
for 3HKA production and investigate the regulation of its synthesis under physiological and pathological
conditions. In Aim 2, by using biotinylated derivatives of 3HKA, and a series of biochemical and biophysical
experiments, we will identify the receptor target of 3HKA and its expression profile. In Aim 3, using targeted and
untargeted phosphoproteomic approaches, screening of kinase libraries and CRISPR/Cas9 knock down
strategies we will characterize the 3HKA signal transduction pathway. Additionally, we will analyze the effect of
3HKA on T cell activation and differentiation into a TH1, TH2, TH17 phenotype, naïve vs effector and memory T
cell transition and 3HKA effect on maturation/activation of different APC (DC, pDC, MΦ). Immunophenotyping
will be performed both in vitro and in vivo, using psoriasis or nephrotoxic lupus as animal models. Finally, in Aim
4 we leveraged our knowledge on 3HKA and generated 3HKA-like compounds, predicted to have an anti-
inflammatory effect. These analogs will be screened in a series of in vitro and in vivo assay to fully assess their
potential as novel immunomodulatory molecules"
10850986,"The Strategic Vision of the Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center (SWEHSC) is to facilitate and
implement innovative research and community engagement aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying
environmental health (EHS) risks and disease among people living in arid environments undergoing climate
change. Importantly, the SWEHSC strategic vision supports our long-term goal of uniting interdisciplinary
scientists to study environmental effects on the health and well-being of unique populations in the Southwest
US, including Native American, Latinx, and rural communities. Because the unique conditions of the arid desert
Southwest environment mirror those of many other global desert climates, the interdisciplinary research
conducted by the SWEHSC could also improve the lives of the 2.1 billion people globally who live in arid lands.
As climate change increases the burden on human health through water and respiratory exposures due to
drought, wildfires, and decreasing water supply, the arid Southwest serves as the proverbial `canary in the coal
mine' for the resulting health effects. Specifically, research within the SWEHSC focuses on 1) routes of exposure
in arid environments, including exposure to groundwater contaminants and inhalation, 2) the adverse health
outcomes following inhalation of air pollutants, and 3) the molecular pathways of adaptive responses to
environmental exposures such as arsenic and ultraviolet light. If climate change is not reversed, the EHS factors
prevalent in the desert Southwest will forecast the future concerns of much of the rest of the US. Accordingly,
our mission impacts not only the health and well-being of the arid Southwest populations, but also the billions of
people across the planet affected by climate change.
The SWEHSC will continue to improve the health of people in arid lands by developing rational approaches to
identifying and mitigating hazardous environmental exposures. The geographic location of the SWEHSC, with
its large Latinx, Native American, and rural communities, provides unique research opportunities to identify and
address basic environmental health hazards that impact these populations. Moreover, strengthening ties
between SWEHSC faculty and academic and governmental agencies in Mexico enables impactful binational
EHS initiatives, with the tangible ability to improve public health along the US-Mexico border and for broad
translation to global stakeholders."
10810771,"Post-transcriptional regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) orchestrate diverse
molecular and cellular mechanisms that pattern early mammalian development from embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) through gastrulation and lineage commitment. The RBPs Ago2 (Argonaute-2) and IRP (iron regulatory
proteins) respectively coordinate miRNA-mediated regulation and cellular iron regulation, mechanisms essential
for the proper execution of early embryonic development. In human development, cellular iron regulation is
important for non-hematopoietic tissue development, including neurogenesis and gut development, in addition
to erythropoiesis. However, the identities and functional roles of miRNA- and IRP-bound targets in cell fate
decisions during early embryonic development are largely unknown. A comprehensive understanding of the
dynamic relationships of IRPs, miRNAs, and their functional targets during this critical developmental window is
needed and can provide a roadmap for functional rewiring in stem/progenitor cell-based regenerative therapies.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that IRP and miRNAs function cooperatively and dynamically on targets
that are important regulators of cell fate transitions during mammalian development. As a molecular biologist
and pathologist, my long-term goal is to understand and use these integrated pathways of post-transcriptional
control to devise new tools and approaches for functional rewiring in stem/progenitor cell-based regenerative
therapies. The objective of this project is to dissect the specific roles of post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs
and IRPs on cell fate decisions in early mammalian development and to build platforms to model cellular iron
throughout early mammalian development. This project objective will be achieved by 1) determining the impact
of IRP and miR-290-mediated regulation on Profilin-2, a known regulator of ESC differentiation, 2) identifying
and functionally dissecting the global network of bound IRP and miRNA targets, and 3) developing biosensor
platforms that model cellular iron utilization in vitro and in vivo during early embryonic development. The
proposed studies are the core components of the Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) for Dr.
Carolyn Sangokoya. Dr. Sangokoya is a board-certified Anatomic Pathologist with subspeciality expertise in
surgical and gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary pathology. This proposal encompasses a five-year plan to address
gaps in specific research and professional skills as she transitions to independence as a physician-scientist. This
grant is a training vehicle for Dr. Sangokoya to 1) build knowledge in statistical methods for functional genomics,
2) learn and expand technical skills in generating mouse models, 3) perform single-cell RNA-sequencing studies,
and 4) develop professional scientific leadership and lab management skills in transition to leading a successful
laboratory. To achieve these goals, Dr. Sangokoya and her multidisciplinary scientific advisory and mentoring
team have devised a 5-year career development plan. The proposed training, didactics, and research in the rich

grossly insufficient capacity for care provision or research. This global research program aims to advance our
understanding of common neurological disorders in the African context to inform the local prevention and
treatment of these conditions while also elucidating pathophysiological processes more broadly relevant. This
will be accomplished through the continuation of Dr. Birbeck's neuro-HIV and cerebral malaria investigations
plus support and mentorship for young clinician scientists engaged in a broad range of research endeavors.
Research activities include--
 • Cerebral malaria: In a prospective cohort study of children with CNS malaria, we will examine the role
 of neuroinflammation in structural injury and neurologic morbidity with laboratory assessments of acute
 inflammation, serial neuroimaging, and long term neurological outcomes. The novel study population
 will include children in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of aggressive antipyretics as well as a more
 representative non-RCT population. The effects of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 on parasite
 clearance, inflammatory factors associated with malarial death and neurologic sequelae and structural
 injuries including ischemia, bleeding, and thromboses will be ascertained.
• Neuro-HIV: Given the widespread availability of HIV therapies, the next challenge in neuro-HIV care in
Africa includes noncommunicable disorders associated with chronic low grade inflammation. Utilizing
our network of rural and urban HIV clinics, we will study HIV-associated accelerated aging of the
nervous system. Given its highly inflammatory state, SARS-CoV-2 could potentially contribute to this
burden. Among children, we have recently reported high rates of subclinical cerebrovascular disease
(CVD) despite long-standing, effectively treated HIV. We will pursue further imaging studies including in
HIV uninfected but exposed children and community controls to identify risk factors for CVD, examine
the metabolic impact of antiretroviral therapies and assess the relationship between premature CVD
and infection with SARS-Co-V2. Among adults with HIV, SARS-Co-V2 infection will be evaluated for its
possible role in accelerated aging in a 5-year prospective cohort study monitoring for cognitive
impairment, psychiatric symptoms, strokes, neuropathies and seizures.
This research will be undertaken in Zambia and Malawi where Dr. Birbeck has worked for over 25 years. This
research program award will also provide infrastructure, mentorship and a vibrant environment for scholarship
and trainee engagement with both US and African academics."
10830315,"Summary
 Transmembrane proteins must adopt proper membrane topology to perform their function. In
mammalian cells, the topology of transmembrane proteins is determined by the direction through
which transmembrane helices are inserted into ER during their translation on ER-associated
ribosomes. It has been assumed that protein translocation across the ER membranes is a
constitutive process so that transmembrane proteins must adopt a fixed topology. This assumption
has been challenged by our recent observation that the direction through which transmembrane
helices are inserted into the ER can be reversed under certain physiological conditions. We reported
that ceramide inverted the topology of two polytopic transmembrane proteins, namely TM4SF20 and
CCR5. Since this regulatory mechanism does not flip transmembrane proteins that have already
been synthesized but inverts the topology of newly synthesized proteins by changing the direction
through which transmembrane helices are translocated across membranes, we designated this
process as Regulated Alternative Translocation (RAT).
 This project is initiated to further characterize RAT by delineating the mechanism of this
topological regulation. We will begin by testing the hypothesis that TRAM2 is the ceramide sensor
that interacts with the nascent transmembrane helices subjected to RAT. The approaches developed
for this study can be generalized to identify ceramide interactome, a finding that might reveal more
signaling reactions mediated by the sphingolipid. These approaches may also be applied unbiasedly
to identify proteins interacting with the nascent transmembrane helices subjected to RAT, thereby
providing more mechanistic insights into this novel translocation regulation.
 This project will also identify proteins subject to RAT by a novel proteome-wide approach
capable of measuring topology of transmembrane proteins globally. Achieving this part of the project
will not only reveal the breadth of RAT but also provide essential experimental data for proteome-
wide assembly of topology of transmembrane proteins. Considering that only 10% of mammalian
transmembrane proteins have their topology defined by experimental evidence, accomplishing this
project should greatly improve our understanding of transmembrane proteins."
10829859,"Project Summary / Abstract
The main pathological changes found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are extracellular amyloid β (Aβ)
deposits in the brain parenchyma (amyloid plaques) and abnormal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau
protein in brain neurons (neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs). Amyloid plaques and NFTs are accompanied with chronic
inflammation characterized by activated microglia and increased levels of cytokines. Except a small subset of
early-onset familial AD cases, the causes for the vast majority of AD cases are unknown and satisfactory
therapeutic and preventive measures for AD are unavailable. Therefore, an urgent need exists to identify the
molecular mechanisms that increase the risk for the vast majority of AD cases and to develop the preventive and
therapeutic measures. Systemic inflammation promotes AD progression and even initiates microglial activation
and neurodegeneration. Indeed, recent genetic studies on late-onset AD have identified about a dozen genetic
risk variants that are highly expressed in microglia and involved in innate immune responses, highlighting the
importance of immune responses, particularly activated microglia, in the pathogenesis of late-onset AD. Aging
is the largest known risk factor for AD and is characterized by chronic, systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging).
Systemic inflammation caused by certain bacterial and viral infections is a strong risk factor of dementia, also.
Additionally, our preliminary data indicate that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through the MyD88 signaling
pathway in microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) plays essential roles in the AD pathogenesis. In Aim
1, we will produce a microglia specific MyD88 deficiency in AD mouse models during aging and determine their
effect on Aβ and tau pathology and cognitive function. We further hypothesize that microglial MyD88 signaling
plays a predominant role in accelerating brain Aβ and tau pathology and neuroinflammation, which are induced
by chronic, systemic inflammation, in AD mouse models during aging. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of
systemic LPS treatment on Aβ and tau pathology and cognition in AD mouse models with brain and peripheral
immune cell-specific MyD88 deficiency. In Aim 3, we will determine the age and sex dependent effects of LPS
treatment on NLRP3 inflammasome activation as disease mechanisms in the brain/microglia-specific and
peripheral immune cell-specific MyD88 deficient AD mouse models. Our hypothesis is that LPS-induced
systemic inflammation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia via MyD88 signaling, leading to
exacerbation of AD-like pathophysiology in AD mouse models. The long term goals are to determine the role of
microglial MyD88/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in the AD pathogenesis, to elucidate the molecular
mechanism underlying the increased AD risk associated with systemic inflammation and to develop new
preventive and therapeutic strategies for AD."

Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) are bone and soft tissue cancers that affect children and adolescents.
Surgery, radiation and multi-agent chemotherapy have improved patient prognosis but a therapeutic plateau has
been reached for both localized and metastatic cases. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel and targeted
therapeutic strategies. Towards that goal, this Multi-PI collaborative research project will investigate the
hypothesis that ESFT cells are dependent on FEN1, an endonuclease that processes the 5’ flaps of Okazaki
fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis, for viability. This hypothesis is supported by: (a) Four genome-
scale CRISPR library screens have independently found that ESFT cell lines are highly sensitive to FEN1-
CRISPRs; (b) ESFT cells were reported to be phenotypically BRCA1-deficient, and we have shown that
BRCA1/2-deficient cells are hypersensitive to FEN1 inhibition; and (c) we have found several ESFT cell lines to
be sensitive to FEN1-CRISPRs, FEN1-siRNAs and two small molecular FEN1-inhibitors. A team of three
principal investigators will jointly direct this project: RD Kolodner is a geneticist and an inventor of FEN1-inhibitors
in documented patent applications, JYJ Wang is a cancer biologist with expertise in DNA damage response, and
SH Choo is a pediatric oncologist with an ongoing IRB to conduct research with ESFT patient samples. Together,
we will pursue four specific aims to investigate the ESFT-dependency on FEN1. AIM-1: To demonstrate and to
quantify FEN1-essentiality in a panel of 10 ESFT cell lines by genetic ablation of FEN1 with validated siRNAs
and CRISPR/CAS9, respectively. AIM-2: To determine the cytotoxic effects of small molecule FEN1 inhibitors
on 10 ESFT cell lines by short-term growth and death assays and longer-term colony formation assays in 2D
and 3D cultures. We will edit FEN1 in ESFT cells to express a drug-resistant FEN1R enzyme so as to
demonstrate on-target effects. We will evaluate the potential synergistic interactions between FEN1-inhibitors
and the chemotherapeutic drugs currently used in the clinic to treat ESFT patients. AIM-3: To investigate the
mechanisms underlying ESFT dependency on FEN1 by addressing three mechanistic questions on whether (a)
the EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein of ESFT induces FEN1-dependency, (b) FEN1-inhibitors cause irreversible blockade
of DNA replication in ESFT cells, and (c) FEN1-inhibitors cause DNA breakage and mitotic catastrophe in ESFT
cells. AIM-4: To determine the effects of FEN1 inhibitors on ESFT growth in mice. We have found that a FEN1-
inhibitor (SMD154) reduced the growth of orthotopic xenografts from an ESFT cell line in athymic nude mice.
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of SMD154 support its testing on orthotopic xenografts from two ESFT cell lines that
show sufficiently low in vitro IC50 for this compound. We will construct 4-6 ESFT patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
from biopsies and resected tumors. We will test SMD154 and future FEN1-inhibitors with optimized PKs on cell
line- and patient-derived xenografts. This comprehensive preclinical study will produce a detailed understanding
of the ESFT-dependency on FEN1 and pave the way towards developing FEN1-inhibitors to treat ESFT."

The long-term objective of the proposed work is to provide evidenced-based recommendations for minimizing
metabolic adverse events, particularly weight gain, in a diverse population of people living with HIV (PLWH) by
identifying and quantifying variability in drug exposure that may increase risk in patient subgroups. We will
consider a broad array of modifying factors of drug exposure, including demographic characteristics, prior
laboratory values, body anthropometrics, frailty phenotype, and pharmacogenomics. Our focus is on the
integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC), as well as tenofovir
alafenamide (TAF). The MWCCS includes diverse PLWH underrepresented in Phase III clinical trials and thus,
in the sponsor-developed population pharmacokinetic models of the drug. In AIM 1, we will enroll diverse PLWH
from four MWCCS sites to collect pharmacokinetic data and further refine the knowledge of factors that influence
DTG, BIC, and TAF pharmacokinetics. Drug concentrations will be measured in blood plasma and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (TAF only) in the UNC Center for AIDS Research Clinical Pharmacology and Analytical
Chemistry Laboratory (CFAR CPAC). Nonlinear mixed effects models will be used to develop a comprehensive
PK model for each drug of interest. Using these models, then, in AIM 2, we will retrospectively measure drug
concentrations in repository specimens (using the same methods and laboratory as AIM 1, and predict drug
clearance in men and women from initiation of DTG, BIC, and/or TAF. These drug clearances, predicted for
multiple visits per participant, will then be analyzed as the predictors of body weight gain, increased waist to hip
ratio, and increased insulin resistance (as measured by HOMA-IR) over the course of treatment on the drug of
interest, with multiple measures of drug exposure. The hypothesis is that those PLWH with higher drug exposure
(via slower drug clearance) will be more likely to experience the metabolic adverse events of these drugs. Upon
completion, we expect to have the underpinnings of a model-based risk estimator developed for further
prospective validation."
10796945,"Metastasis accounts for the vast majority of cancer-related deaths but its underlying mechanisms are
incompletely understood. During tumor progression extensive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment
occurs and facilitates metastasis. In particular, linearization of collagen, one of the most abundant extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins in tumors, is recognized as a hallmark of aggressive breast cancers and is associated
with poor prognosis. At the cellular level, bundles of linearized collagen facilitate tumor cell invasion and
metastasis by providing tracks on which tumor cells can easily migrate. Cell-generated mechanical tension has
been proposed to contribute to collagen remodeling, but it remained unknown whether this is the sole
mechanism by which collagen linearization is established or whether other mechanisms also play prominent
roles in this process. Our recent studies revealed that cancer cells secrete factors that can linearize collagen
independently of cell-generated mechanical forces. Specifically, we found that the tumor cell-secreted factor
WISP1 (CCN4) promotes collagen linearization, tumor cell invasion and metastasis. However, the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which WISP1 linearizes collagen and promote metastasis remain incompletely
understood. To uncover these mechanisms we will 1) define the specific steps of the metastatic cascade that
are impacted by WISP1, 2) determine the molecular mechanisms by which WISP1 regulates collagen
linearization and promotes tumor cell invasion, and 3) test therapeutic modalities to block WISP1’s function
and prevent metastasis. This will be achieved by performing detailed analyses of breast cancer progression
and metastasis in mouse models and in vitro invasion assays. Central to our studies is also the use of
scanning electron microscopy and intravital multiphoton fluorescence and second harmonic generation
microscopy to visualize alterations in ECM architecture in vitro and in vivo. Globally, these studies will elucidate
fundamental mechanisms of collagen fiber linearization and test innovative therapeutic approaches to limit
metastasis by normalizing collagen architecture."
10837814,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable brain disease, distinguished by the progressive accumulation of toxic

astrocytes and the brain vasculature as well as reduced accumulation of amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau

The neonatal mouse heart possesses a remarkable ability to regenerate following injury and this cardiac
regeneration is closely accompanied by robust activation of the immune system. Studies in the last decade have
focused on the role of innate immunity during neonatal heart regeneration, and have established the necessary
roles for macrophages in the repair and regeneration processes following myocardial infarction (MI). However,
macrophages alone are not sufficient to drive neonatal regeneration, as neonatal mice lacking adaptive immunity
but retaining innate immunity cannot regenerate. This result strongly suggests that other immune cells such as
those involved in adaptive immunity also play a role in neonatal heart regeneration. In this project, we aim to
explore the role of adaptive immunity, in particular the CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated inflammatory
response as a bridge between adaptive and innate immune signaling pathways that mediate neonatal
cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation in response to injury. Our preliminary results revealed that the Th2 cell secreted
cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4) is strongly upregulated in neonatal day 1 mouse hearts after MI and can promote
CM proliferation. Its receptor IL-4ra is highly expressed in the proliferating CM population. We hypothesize that
the Th2 cell-mediated IL-4 signaling promotes CM proliferation and macrophage transformation, as well as
generating the cardiotropic factor CCL24 as a critical cytokine pathway in neonatal heart regeneration.
Understanding how immune cells participate in neonatal heart regeneration will enlighten the development of
potential therapeutics to promote adult heart repair and regeneration in humans."
10821381,"Abstract
 Myocardial infarction (MI) due to underlying atherosclerosis is the leading disease
sequela that precipitates heart failure in the Western world. Our ability to treat these
patients and their heart failure has not progressed beyond a mild 20-30% extension in
life span realized some 3 decades ago with neuroendocrine-based management. New
therapeutic avenues are needed, the most dramatic of which would be directly
generating new cardiomyocyte to regenerate the damaged area of heart tissue.
Previous attempts to regenerate the heart through new myocyte production have not
been successful despite more than 15 years of research using adult progenitor cells.
However, studies with cardiac progenitor cells in rodent models did show a functional
benefit to the MI-injured heart, and we and others have identified a novel mechanism of
benefit whereby injected progenitor cells had a rejuvenating effect through refinement of
the immune response. Indeed, we have shown that cell therapy injections can optimize
healing, reduce infarct area expansion and augment scar borderzone physical properties
(Vagnozzi et al., 2020, Nature). These beneficial effects were mediated through
selective macrophage subtype activity in the heart, underscoring the importance of the
immune response in infarct healing and compensation. Here we propose the hypothesis
that selective innate immune response signaling pathways, and macrophage subtype
polarization can be exploited to further heal MI injury. Our more specific hypothesis is
that MI injury or cell therapy has an underlying protective component through cGAS-
Sting in both cardiomyocytes and macrophages, and this can be therapeutically
exploited to polarize the immune response for better healing. The specific aims are:
AIM #1, To use mouse genetics to identify the specific immune cell-types in the heart
that mediate cell therapy-based cardiac rejuvenation post-MI injury. AIM #2, To examine
the mechanism of innate immune signaling in the heart through cGAS-Sting. AIM #3, To
investigate the mechanisms whereby cell therapy rejuvenates the post-MI injured heart.
Such studies will be critical for examining how innate immune signaling at the level of
macrophages impacts the heart during an inflammatory injury response or due to cell
therapy with the goal of modifying this response to benefit healing in patients."
10761746,"Project background: Work is a major social determinant of health. In people with serious mental illness
(SMI), work is associated with better wellbeing, physical and mental health, quality of life, and may
prevent the onset of disability. Among Veterans with SMI, work is a protective factor against suicide.
 Most veterans with SMI are unemployed and suffer substantially worse health and recovery
across key domains. Despite quality VHA vocational services, such as supported employment (SE),
two-thirds or more of veterans who receive these services experience work dysfunction. A probable
explanation lies in unsolved cognitive and behavioral barriers, such as low work-related self-efficacy,
ineffective coping skills, little hope that work is attainable, poor work motivation and sense of self.
 The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Work Success (CBTw) intervention was designed to
target these problems and augment VHA SE services to synergistically improve work, as well as health
and recovery, in Veterans with SMI. In an open trial pilot, CBTw was associated with significant
increases in hours worked and wages earned and the majority of CBTw participants became steady
workers. Veterans also experienced improvements in symptoms, recovery, and quality of life.
Project goals: Using Hybrid 1 RCT design, this project will test the effects of CBTw on competitive work
and health and recovery outcomes over a 9-month study period at 3 VA SE programs. Informed by the
RE-AIM framework, an implementation evaluation will examine the success of using SE staff to deliver
CBTw, barriers and facilitators to implementation, and strategies utilized.
Relevance to priorities: This project has high implementation potential and is responsive to the VHA
priority regarding Health Equity, as it will address work functioning, an under studied social determinant
of health. WORKWELL also holds promise to improve health and recovery outcomes among Veterans
with SMI, another HSR&D area of emphasis. Lastly, this study is consistent with the goal of finding
novel strategies toward suicide prevention among vulnerable Veteran groups, including those with SMI.
Objectives: Aim 1: Test the effects of CBTw + SE compared to a control of psychoeducation + SE on
work. Hypotheses: Participants in the CBTw+ SE arm will work significantly more total weeks in
competitive jobs (primary study outcome) and will be more likely to become steady workers.
Aim 2: Test the effects of CBTw + SE on health and recovery. Hypotheses: Participants in the CBTw +
SE arm will have greater improvements on subjective recovery and health-related quality of life, and
decreases in symptoms, suicidal ideation, and inpatient service utilization.
Aim 3: Guided by the RE-AIM implementation science framework, conduct an evaluation of the
implementation of CBTw, including examination of the feasibility of using SE staff to deliver CBTw, and
related barriers and facilitators. The objective is to spur future wide scale CBTw implementation.
Project Methods: WORKWELL is a pragmatic, Hybrid 1 design RCT. CBTw will be tested at 3 SE
sites—Roudebush VA Medical Center, the Edward J. Hines VA Medical Center, and the VA St. Louis
Health Care System. 276 unemployed Veterans with SMI will be randomly assigned to receive CBTw
plus SE or a control of psychoeducation plus SE. Outcomes including total weeks worked in
competitive jobs (primary), achievement of steady work, symptoms, recovery, health related quality
of life, suicidal ideation, and service utilization will be assessed at posttreatment (12 weeks), 6 months
(primary endpoint), and 9 months (to examine sustained effects). CBTw implementation planning,
training, and consultation will be provided. CBTw implementation (fidelity), barriers and facilitators to
implementation, and other RE-AIM elements will be examined using mixed methods."
10834120,"One of the most important cancer care advances in recent history is the rapid dissemination of targeted
therapies (molecularly targeted kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors) into the care of patients
with metastatic cancer. The marked expansion of indications for use of these novel therapies has been fueled
by growing enthusiasm among medical oncologists regarding their potential impact on survival for patients with
very poor prognosis. Although the survival benefit of these therapies is modest for most patients, a small
proportion experience long-term remission and potentially even cure of previously incurable cancer. Despite
the exciting promise of these therapies, they are very expensive – sometimes exceeding $10,000 per month.
Because of the high cost and high stakes of these therapies, it is critical to understand their patterns of use; yet
very little is known about targeted therapy use across diverse populations. Moreover, the impact of clinician
factors on variations in use is not known. In the absence of such knowledge it is difficult to develop effective
interventions to support equitable delivery of these therapies to the growing population of patients living with
metastatic cancer. Therefore, we will investigate patterns of use of targeted therapy among a diverse sample
of 2,240 patients diagnosed in 2019 with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, genitourinary cancer, and
melanoma, and ascertained by the Georgia and Los Angeles county SEER registries. We will first characterize
patient factors associated with non-receipt, by creating a powerful combination of archival clinical and
sociodemographic registry data augmented with additional treatment data that SEER staff will collect directly
from clinicians and practices. We hypothesize that significant variations exist in patient use of targeted therapy
across age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography. We will then identify clinician factors that are
associated with tendency to prescribe targeted therapy. Informed by qualitative data that we will collect through
interviews with medical oncologists, we will survey the medical oncologists (clinicians) who treat these patients,
including many who practice in resource-limited settings. We will assess clinicians’ knowledge & attitudes
about targeted therapy, ask specific details about their practice setting, and use clinical vignettes to measure
their tendency to prescribe targeted therapy. We will survey 1025 clinicians and anticipate a 65% response
rate, based on our prior work. We hypothesize that certain clinicians are less likely to prescribe targeted
therapy, including those with less knowledge around targeted therapy and those who practice in resource-
limited settings. Finally, we will merge clinician data with patient data to quantify and explain the influence of
clinicians on variations in patients’ use of targeted therapy. We hypothesize that most (>50%) of the variation
occurs at the clinician level, and that clinician knowledge and attitudes drive most of the variation. The findings
from this study will inform the development of multilevel interventions to improve equitable receipt of targeted
therapies across diverse patient populations and practice settings."
10828353,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The plasminogen activation system extensively regulates the inflammatory response in a broad range of
tissues. Inflammation is essential for maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis and its dysregulation has a
broad pathologic impact, including development of fibrosis, scarring, aberrant wound healing, infection, sepsis,
autoimmune disease and asthma. A critical gap in knowledge is understanding the mechanisms by which
plasminogen communicates with cells to regulate inflammatory responses. Plg-RKT is a novel integral membrane
protein that binds plasminogen via a C-terminal lysine exposed on the cell surface and promotes cell surface
plasminogen activation. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand mechanisms by which Plg-RKT
regulates physiologic and pathologic processes. This proposal is based on new data showing that Plg-RKT
promotes expression of CCL2, a key mediator of the pro-inflammatory response, and a potential intervention
point for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component. Additional results support the provocative
concept that regulation of CCL2 expression, rather than cell surface proteolysis of extracellular matrix, appears
to be the primary mechanism for plasminogen/Plg-RKT control of mononuclear cell recruitment in the
inflammatory response in vivo. The central hypothesis to be addressed is that plasmin(ogen)/Plg-RKT-
dependent promotion of CCL2 expression is the primary mechanism for promotion of plasmin(ogen)/Plg-RKT-
dependent mononuclear cell recruitment in the inflammatory response. The hypothesis will be tested in murine
models of pleurisy and peritonitis. And we will investigate the role of Plg-RKT in the inflammatory response in
asthma because in T helper type 2 (Th2) immune-related diseases, such as asthma, CCL2 is expressed at high
levels and its neutralization in animal models ameliorates disease. The objectives of this proposal are to
investigate the role of Plg-RKT in CCL2 synthesis in vivo and assess its impact on Plg-RKT-dependent
mononuclear cell recruitment and to examine the role of Plg-RKT in the pathogenesis of asthma. Our specific
aims are (1) to investigate the role of Plg-RKT in CCL2 synthesis in vivo and its impact on Plg-RKT-dependent
mononuclear cell recruitment and (2) to examine the role of Plg-RKT in the pathogenesis of asthma. We will use
Plg-RKT deficient mice and mice over-expressing Plg-RKT to test whether plasmino(ogen)/Plg-RKT-dependent
CCL2 up-regulation in vivo is PAR-1- dependent. We will use single cell RNA sequencing to identify cell types
responsible for Plg-RKT-dependent stimulation of CCL2 expression and we will determine whether exogenously
added CCL2 can rescue the impairment in macrophage recruitment in Plg-RKT-/- mice. We will investigate the
role of Plg-RKT in inflammation in ovalbumin-induced asthma and determine whether Plg-RKT regulates airway
hyper-responsiveness (AHR). We expect that accomplishment of our specific aims will establish Plg-RKT as a
pivotal regulator of the inflammatory response via regulation of expression of the key chemoattractant, CCL2,
and provide fundamental insights into how mononuclear cell recruitment is regulated."

Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in US. Statistical designs and data analytics approaches
are instrumental in recent development of more effective treatments for cancer. While successes
like the I-SPY2 trial highlight the advancement, most oncology trials do not fully utilize powerful
statistical innovations and there remains a lack of effective communications between oncologists
and statisticians. To address these issues, we propose the Stat4Onc symposium which provides
a unique platform for oncologists and statisticians to discuss and exchange ideas for pressing
issues in cancer clinical trials, disease diagnosis, patient care, and decision making for drug
development. This symposium will further drive innovations in statistical methodology and data
analytics dedicated for oncology research and translate these innovations to research practice. It
also provides a venue for trainees in oncology and statistics to learn inter-disciplinary
collaborations. The symposium will be rotated among the four participating universities in a five-
year funding period. The symposium is a three-day event, with first day of short courses relevant
to the theme of the year, and then a two-day single-track scientific program. The symposium is
inclusive, with respect to scientific expertise in oncology, statistics, regulatory and data sciences,
to their professional associations from academia (faculty, staff, and students), biopharma and
biotech industry, government agencies, and non-profit organizations, and to gender and ethnicity,
in particular for the inclusion of underrepresented minority groups. The symposium size will be
around 200 participants, allowing adequate and focused discussions. The symposium will be
single tracked to allow participants to be in all the sessions. Keynote talks and all the sessions
will have speakers from academic, government, and industry and with expertise in oncology and
statistics. Trainees in both oncology and statistics disciplines will be supported for attending the
symposium and offers opportunities to present in poster and mixer sessions. Symposium talks
will be published in JCO Precision Oncology and New England Journal of Statistics in Data

10831462,"Molecular motors drive the active transport of organelles along the cellular cytoskeleton. Organelle transport
is critically important in neurons, cells that extend axons reaching up to 1m in length. Axons have limited
capacity for biosynthesis and degradation, thus axonal transport is required to supply newly synthesized
proteins and organelles and to remove aging proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Accumulating evidence
supports a cargo-specific model for axonal transport, in which the opposing activities of kinesin and
cytoplasmic dynein motors are regulated by a distinct complement of regulatory proteins including scaffolding
proteins and activating adaptors. We are interested in the mechanisms that regulate the transport of key
organelles including mitochondria, autophagosomes, and synaptic vesicle precursors. We are also interested
in the mechanisms that lead to site-specific delivery, such as the targeting of newly synthesized synaptic
components to presynaptic sites along the axon. We hypothesize that this delivery is dependent on the
localized regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and organization, which directly affect the initiation and
termination of cargo motility. Finally, we are interested in the mechanisms by which molecular motors and
cytoskeletal dynamics actively remodel organelle membranes, leading to tubulation, fission and fusion. We
tackle these questions using the synergistic approaches of live cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution with
single molecule resolution. We will continue to focus on three major goals. Goal 1: Understanding the
integrated regulation of organelle transport. Each type of organelle transported along the axon has a
distinct pattern of motility that directly relates to its function. We seek to understand the specific mechanisms
involved, focusing on essential axonal cargos, such as mitochondria and autophagosomes, testing the model
that the cargo-specific, integrated regulation of motors allows for sustained transport over long time scales
and distances. In Goal 2, we seek to understand the localized regulation of organelle dynamics within
defined axonal zones, such as the delivery of synaptic vesicle precursors to presynaptic sites along the
axon. These zones exhibit distinct patterns of cytoskeletal organization and cytoskeletal dynamics. We are
interested in the mechanisms that enhance the rate-limiting step of transport initiation and control cargo
delivery/retention at specific sites of cellular need. And in Goal 3, we will study organelle remodeling driven
by molecular motors and/or cytoskeletal dynamics. Organelles such as mitochondria undergo dramatic
remodeling via mechanisms including fission and fusion. We hypothesize that molecular motors and
cytoskeletal filaments provide an adaptable toolbox that can be specifically tuned to regulate dynamic
organelle morphology. Together, these approaches will provide important new insights into organelle
dynamics in neurons. As deficits in axonal transport lead to neurodegeneration, we hope that our progress
may provide new opportunities for targeted and effective therapeutic approaches."

In the last funding cycle Development Funds were utilized for 1) pilot projects in which 10 were funded directly
through the CCSG using an annual competitive call (two per year); 2) CCSG support for a developing shared
resource; 3) two staff investigators who received CCSG funds to expand renal cell carcinoma research (Dr.
Weiss) and to develop an Immuno-Oncology research initiative (Dr. Monjazeb); 4) facilitate the research of
four faculty using CCSG funds, Dr. Yu (molecular pharmacology), Dr. Li (nano-medicine platforms), Dr. Wang
(biomedical imaging) and Dr. Izumiya (viral and pathogen malignancies). Additionally, 100 pilot projects were
funded by leveraging non-CCSG institutional support through a research initiative, a research program,
interdepartmental collaborations, philanthropic contributions, or Director discretionary funds based on
addressing the strategic needs for the Center. Seed funding support brought in $27M in new individual and

10933392,"Abstract
Even though all somatic cells trace their developmental lineages traced back to a single fertilized egg, during the
course of development and aging, various mutagenic exposures, DNA replication errors, and imperfect DNA
repair lead to accumulation of somatic mutations – resulting in genetic variations among somatic cells in a tissue.
While somatic mutations have primarily been investigated in the contexts of phenotypic conditions such as
pigmentation patterns, diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity etc, or disease precursors such as field
cancerization and clonal hematopoiesis, emerging evidence suggests that somatic mutations in apparently
healthy tissues might be more common than previously anticipated, and that clonal makeups of somatic tissues
continue to evolve throughout the lifetime. Nonetheless, our understanding of the patterns of ‘normal’ somatic
variations in pathologically normal tissues remains limited –in terms of the types of tissues affected, classes of
genomic alterations, and their etiologies – in part, due to technological barriers. In particular, many types of
genomic alterations in mosaic somatic tissues remain poorly characterized. Recent technological developments
have enabled examining complex patterns of genomic alterations and their significance in tissue contexts at
unprecedented resolution and high accuracy. Here, utilizing emerging genomic technologies and computational
genomics resources, and focusing on organs that have different types of exposure and regeneration abilities,
we will ask two related questions: What are the prevalence and patterns of somatic genomic alterations in
pathologically normal tissues? To what extent such genomic alterations contribute towards transcriptomic and
phenotypic variations at the cellular and tissue-level? This research contributes towards understanding the
landscape of somatic variations in pathologically normal tissues in human. Regularity of healthy tissues is taken
for granted, which under-appreciates the genetic and non-genetic variations within. Our efforts have potentials
to challenge the dogma, that have relevance for development, aging, and many disease types including cancer,
immune and neurological disorders. Importantly, it will provide us with a baseline to compare the alterations
observed in disease and pre-disease conditions, which would have implications for early detection, disease
prevention, and minimizing over-diagnosis. We will also develop computational genomic resources contributing
towards reproducible research and community-level resource sharing for advancing our understanding of
somatic variations in human tissues."

An urgent need exists for new methods to rapidly prepare complex molecules with the potential to become new
drugs. There is a widening gap in both the accessibility of complex core structures that are difficult to exploit and
in the availability of core structures that are not already the subject of numerous patents. This gap will be
addressed by identifying new synthetic methods that achieve the dual goals of enabling efficient access to useful
cores and exploring previously inaccessible ""chemical space."" The long-term goal of our research program is to
understand the reactivity of unstabilized metal carbenes. The objective of this application is to explore the ability
of rhodium donor-donor carbenes to engage in a wide variety of useful new applications. The central hypothesis
is that appending two ""donor"" groups to a carbene opens up new avenues of reactivity for organic chemistry.
This hypothesis is supported by preliminary results regarding a) the unique ability of donor/donor carbenes to
engage in highly enantioselective C–H insertion reactions and b) a new mild and catalytic process for the
formation of reactive dienes for cycloaddition reactions! Small molecules comprise the vast majority of treatments
for both acute and chronic diseases in both the developed and developing world. Research in this application
will lay the groundwork to save lives and enable the next generation of pharmaceutical discovery by focusing on
three areas of research. First, we will explore new C–H insertion reactions the enable the synthesis of complex
carba- and heterocyclic structures, culminating in an efficient synthesis of polycyclic alkaloid natural products
that will be studies for the ability to induce neuroplasticity for the treatment of PTSD, depression and other
neurological disorders. Second, we will explore new reactions of rhodium donor-donor carbenes that branch out
form C–H insertion into new reactions that access new chemotypes. Finally, we will, for the first time, build a
QSSR model that will enable the design, synthesis and exploration of new catalysts that are custom-designed
to enhance the reactivity of donor-donor carbenes. The proposed approach is innovative because it is based on
a new methodological platform that enables previously inaccessible chemical reactivity. This research is
significant because it will change the way synthetic chemists approach targets while at the same time opening
up new vistas for discovery of useful molecules for medicine and other fields. Ultimately, the discoveries
emerging from our research will represent a vertical step in the assembly of molecular architectures that will
translate into new medicines to address our society's most pressing health challenges."
10825567,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to understand post-transcriptional mechanisms that spatially and temporally control gene
activity during animal development. We focus on intracellular mRNA localization, translational control, and
degradation, which play crucial roles in regulating production of proteins from maternally supplied transcripts.
These transcripts, which underpin the initial developmental program of nearly all animals, are pre-loaded in the
egg. Thus, control over where and when they are deployed to produce protein must be exerted post-
transcriptionally. Our research capitalizes on the highly manipulable Drosophila model, which relies heavily on
maternal transcripts, to investigate mechanisms that generate asymmetric maternal mRNA and protein
distributions needed for embryonic body patterning and germline development. Our previous work revealed that
numerous mRNAs accumulate at the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte through their incorporation into large,
non-membrane-bound ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies called germ granules. During embryogenesis, germ
granules deliver this cohort of mRNAs to the primordial germ cells, where they support germline development.
Germ granules are a hallmark of primordial germ cells throughout the animal kingdom. They contain conserved
components that indicate a common function in RNA regulation to promote the differentiation, proliferation, and
maintenance of the germline. Germ granules are just one of a plethora of cellular RNP assemblies that have
been characterized for their phase-transitioned behavior. How mRNA regulation occurs in the context of RNA
granules more generally and its biological significance remain, however, poorly understood. As complex and
biologically relevant RNP assemblies, germ granules are ideal for studying RNA localization, translational
control, and degradation and, in particular, their biological significance. Our studies lead to a model for germ
granule ""client"" RNA accumulation by self-recruitment and organization into homotypic clusters. This model
provides a framework to investigate how mRNAs self-organize in granules and how this organization imparts
selective control over the translation and stability of different mRNAs within shared granules. We will combine
quantitative high resolution imaging with powerful biochemical and genetic/genomic strategies, as well as novel
methods that disrupt granules, to investigate fundamental principles governing the organization of granule client
RNAs. These studies will enable us to decipher the relationship between granule association, translational
activity, and germ granule function. Given the widespread use of post-transcriptional mechanisms during
development, and the prevalence of RNA compartmentalization in granules, this work will have broad impact.
Mechanistic insights gained from our studies will also provide a foundation for understanding defects in RNA
metabolism associated with numerous disorders including infertility, cancer, and neurodegeneration."
10860968,"SUMMARY
Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) results from an immune-mediated kidney injury, which is triggered by use of
medications (such as proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and immune checkpoint inhibitors) or by autoimmune
diseases (such as Sjogren’s syndrome and sarcoidosis). An episode of AIN results in permanent kidney
damage in 40-60% of patients and AIN is the cause of about 2% of all cases of chronic kidney disease, which
is equivalent to 0.5-1 million U.S. adults. There are two major challenges in the clinical care of patients with
AIN. First, due to lack of a reliable non-invasive biomarker, AIN diagnosis requires a kidney biopsy. Biopsy
may not be feasible in some patients due to bleeding risk or is delayed in order to optimize this risk. This delay
in diagnosis contributes to incomplete recovery of kidney function. Second, corticosteroid therapy, the current
standard of care for AIN treatment, does not appear to benefit all patients while exposing them to the risk of
short- and long-term adverse events. However, characteristics predicting a favorable response to corticosteroid
therapy are currently unknown.
The overall goal of this proposal is to validate urine interleukin (IL)-9 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α as
biomarkers to diagnose AIN (aim 1) and to identify the subgroup of patients in whom corticosteroid therapy is
beneficial (aim 2). In a study of 265 patients conducted at two Yale-affiliate hospitals, we showed that the
multiplication product of IL-9 and TNF-α (IL-9*TNF-α) was independently associated with AIN and showed area
under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71, 0.88). Addition of IL-9*TNF-α to the
clinician’s pre-biopsy diagnosis increased AUC from 0.62 (0.53, 0.71) to 0.85 (0.78, 0.91). We also found that
corticosteroid use was associated with higher glomerular filtration rate 6-months after diagnosis only in patients
with higher urine IL-9*TNF-α (by 19.7 ml/min/1.73m2). Here we propose a larger, multicenter, observational
study to validate these findings. We will enroll a cohort of 580 patients at two large university medical centers
(Yale and Johns Hopkins), collect urine samples for biomarker measurement, and establish presence or
absence of AIN through an independent, blinded adjudication process led by three renal pathologists. In aim 1,
we will validate IL-9*TNF-α as a diagnostic biomarker for AIN by demonstrating improvement in AUC for AIN
with IL-9*TNF-α over a clinical model and clinician’s prebiopsy impression. We will also describe test
characteristics at two pre-specified cut-offs and test accuracy in differentiating key sub-groups (drug vs. other
and by drug classes). In aim 2, we will validate IL-9*TNF-α as a biomarker to identify subgroup of patients most
likely to experience kidney function recovery with clinically-prescribed corticosteroids. We will follow patients
with AIN for up to six months to determine kidney function after AIN. Results from this study will allow
diagnosis of AIN before occurrence of permanent kidney damage, eliminate the need for a biopsy in some
patients, and identify the subgroup of patients in whom immunosuppressive therapy could be beneficial."
10844596,"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inflammatory cytokines produced by synovial (joint) cells drive disease
pathogenesis by activating cells in inflamed joints and promoting recruitment of immune cells. The long-term
goals of this project are to understand how cytokines and inflammatory factors expressed in RA synovium
activate cells to drive disease pathogenesis, and to elucidate mechanisms that regulate production of
pathogenic cytokines in the context of RA synovitis. An associated goal is to use this knowledge to develop
safer and effective therapies that target disease-related mechanisms of cytokine production and function.
 This project has focused on two key synovial cell types important in RA pathogenesis, fibroblast-like
synoviocytes (FLS) and synovial macrophages (Ms; previously termed type A synoviocytes). These two
cell types interact closely in RA synovium. RA synovial macrophages express gene signatures reflecting
inflammatory NF-B and Jak-STAT signaling and produce inflammatory cytokines. RA FLS produce
cytokines and inflammatory factors such prostaglandins (PGs), and exhibit tissue-destructive properties.
 In the previous project period, we defined a role for FLS in regulating inflammatory M phenotype
by modulating TNF responses to suppress IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression while promoting
synergistic expression of inflammatory genes and growth factors that in turn increased FLS invasive
behavior. A large fraction of the FLS-modulated TNF response in Ms was mediated by prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) and accordingly was almost completely recapitulated by exogenous PGE2, working via G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cAMP signaling. PGE2-cAMP signaling suppressed TNF and ISG
expression, but cooperated with TNF to induce distinct inflammatory `synergy genes'.
 Strikingly, the gene signature commonly induced by FLS+TNF and PGE2+TNF was expressed in
RA synovial macrophages, including a subset identified by single cell RNA sequencing that also expresses
inflammatory and IFN signatures. These results highlight the importance of GPCR and downstream cAMP
signaling in the RA synovial macrophage phenotype. GPCR-cAMP signaling in RA synovium can be
activated by various factors including PGs, acidosis and neuropeptides. Thus, it is important to understand
the impact of GPCR-cAMP signaling on macrophage inflammatory responses.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that the impact of PGE2- and GPCR-cAMP signaling on macrophage
inflammatory responses can be selectively modulated to more effectively suppress TNF and ISGs, while
avoiding induction of potentially pathogenic `synergy genes' such as those expressed by RA macrophages.
In this project we will dissect signaling and chromatin-mediated mechanisms by which cAMP signaling
regulates inflammatory responses in human macrophages. We anticipate that our studies will provide
knowledge that can be used to shift GPCR-cAMP signaling towards increased suppression of inflammation."

The ability of cells to adapt to a wide variety of stress conditions plays a critical role in various physiological and
pathological settings, including development, cancer and neurological disorders. Our group reported the
identification of stress-induced low complexity dinucleotide repeat noncoding RNA derived from stimuli-specific
loci of the ribosomal intergenic spacer (rIGSRNA); an enigmatic region of the human genome historically
dismissed as “junk” DNA. We showed that low complexity rIGSRNA initiate physiological amyloidogenic
programs that convert nucleoli into Amyloid-bodies: reversible fibrous membrane-less organelles composed of
immobilized proteins with amyloid-like features. While many membrane-less compartments have been described
as liquid-like (e.g., stress granules, P-bodies, germ cell granules), the discovery of Amyloid-bodies provided
evidence of an amyloidogenic process that can physiologically transition biological matter to a solid-like state.
This rather unusual post-translational regulatory pathway enables the rapid and reversible storage of an array of
endogenous proteins in Amyloid-bodies to suppress metabolism in cells responding to severe environmental
insults. We propose to convert our NIGMS R01 grant funded in 2015 and renewed in 2018 to a MIRA under the
unifying theme “Function of low complexity rIGSRNA during stress”. Our research program includes in-depth
studies to understand (i) the mechanisms by which rIGSRNA activate physiological amyloidogenesis to construct
Amyloid-bodies and (ii) the function of rIGSRNA and Amyloid-bodies during stress. Studies outlined in this
proposal will involve isolated Amyloid-bodies, multi-color single molecule imaging of active translation sites
during stress, protein dynamics, long read sequencing of untemplated RNA, rRNA biology, and in vitro fibrillation
assays to understand the cellular and biochemical functions of low complexity RNA in cells engaging in anaerobic
metabolism, amongst other conditions. This NIGMS-funded research has enabled our laboratory to make
conceptual advances in our understanding of simple dinucleotide low complexity repeats in the genome. First,
the discovery that rIGRSNA construct Amyloid-bodies provided evidence that cells can activate physiological
liquid-to-solid phase transitions to assemble condensates with amyloid-like properties. These characteristics
distinguish Amyloid-bodies from the multitude of liquid condensates that populate mammalian cells, which
typically do not display amyloidogenic features. Our proposed work will not only shed light on adaptive
mechanisms to stressors but also provide alternative insights for the study of pathological amyloidogenesis
involved in an array of human neurological disorders. Second, the finding that low complexity RNA sequences
are functional determinants of rIGSRNA may stimulate research on the physiological role of long dinucleotide
intergenic repeats observed across the genome, but generally dismissed as useless DNA/RNA. Hence, this
project will be of general interest to scientists interested in cellular response to stressors, long noncoding RNA
biology, nuclear/cytoplasmic structures, translation and physiological/pathological amyloidogenesis."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular pathology of inherited retinal degeneration
(IRD) by (a) generating maps of human retinal cell type-specific regulatory elements, (b) utilizing these maps to
identify non-coding IRD causative mutations within retinal regulatory elements, and (c) gaining insight into the
molecular underpinnings of pathological non-coding IRD mutations using cellular and animal models. IRDs are
the most common cause of irreversible blindness in young individuals affecting 1 in 3000 individuals. Mutations
in coding and splice site sequences in known IRD associated genes contribute to about 60%-65% of cases
while the remaining 40%-35% of cases are currently unresolved. Mutations in non-coding or regulatory
sequences are suggested to be responsible for a large proportion of these unresolved cases. Although the
ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated detailed maps of regulatory elements for the
majority of body tissues, retina is left out. Lack of these maps is a major limitation in identifying IRD causative
mutations involving regulatory sequences in retinal cells. We have analyzed the whole genome sequence
(WGS) of 125 pedigrees with IRD; of these, 49 remain unresolved with no candidate causative nucleotide
changes or structural variants (SVs) in coding or splice site sequences. This leads us to hypothesize the
involvement of non-coding variants in pathology. We also have access to more than 391 additional IRD
pedigrees that remained unresolved after WGS analysis. In this application we propose to test the
hypothesis that non-coding sequence changes are involved in IRD pathology for the majority of these
unresolved pedigrees. We will conduct the following studies: Aim 1, establish human retinal cell type specific
maps of regulatory elements using innovative single cell genomics methodologies we developed, Aim 2, rank
prioritize candidate causative variants using the retinal cell type-specific regulatory element maps and WGS of
unresolved pedigrees, Aim 3, validate the impact of high ranking non-coding candidate disease causing
variants in the context of the genome architecture of retinal cell types by developing patient iPSC-derived
retinal cell models and mouse models. These studies will result in the establishment of retinal cell type-specific
high-resolution multi-omic maps and will potentially identify, for the first time, non-coding variants involved in
the pathology of IRD. The outcomes of these studies will (1) significantly enhance our understanding of the
architecture of retinal cell type-specific regulatory networks, (2) reveal the molecular pathology underlying IRD,
(3) establish a highly valuable, publicly-available data set of cis-regulatory elements relevant to retinal
degenerative diseases as a resource for retinal disease research, (4) improve mutation detection in patients,
and (5) facilitate discovery and development of novel therapies for IRD. We have assembled a multidisciplinary
team of outstanding investigators with expertise in epigenetics (Ren), genome sciences (Frazer) and IRD
genetics and disease modeling (Ayyagari) who are well positioned to complete this ambitious project."
10853126,"Project Summary/Abstract
The normal platelet count in human blood is 150,000-400,000/μL, and these platelets are responsible for efficient
hemostatic surveillance and bleeding mitigation in the body. Thrombocytopenia (TCP, low platelet count) is a
condition caused by a decrease in platelet production, increase in platelet destruction or consumption, or
increase in splenic sequestration. The age-adjusted prevalence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is
estimated to be 3.3 per 100,000 persons in the USA, while drug-induced TCP affects 1-2 per 100,000 persons.
The majority (>95%) of TCP cases result from autoimmune disorders or are induced by chemo- and
radiotherapies as well as other pharmaceuticals. At platelet counts <50,000/μL, surgical procedures are
complicated by high bleeding risks and any minor injury may lead to excessive bleeding. At counts <10,000/μL,
spontaneous bleeding becomes a major concern. Therefore, frequent therapeutic and prophylactic platelet
transfusions are required to increase platelet counts and mitigate bleeding risks. However, the availability of
natural platelet products is severely limited by a near-static pool of donors and a very short shelf-life (3-5 days)
due to high risks of bacterial contamination and storage-related platelet activation and degranulation. Therefore,
there exists a significant unmet clinical need for a therapeutic agent that can mitigate bleeding complications
intravenously in TCP patients, while allowing reduced contamination and long shelf-life without compromising
function. To this end, we have developed a synthetic hemostatic nanotechnology, called SynthoPlateTM, that
mimics platelet’s ability to adhere and aggregate specifically at a site of injury in the body. In Phase I of this
SBIR, we demonstrated platelet-mimetic hemostatic functions in vitro as well as in vivo in proof-of-concept TCP
murine models of bleeding. Building on this in the proposed Phase II studies, we aim to: 1) Establish appropriate
clinical biomarkers for monitoring SP efficacy in thrombocytopenic (TCP) patient blood samples, 2) determine
the effective pharmacodynamic (PD) dosing window of SynthoPlateTM in a rabbit bleeding model of
thrombocytopenia, and 3) establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SP in healthy and thrombocytopenic
(TCP) rabbits. Altogether, these experiments will establish and correlate PK with ex vivo functional assays and
in vivo PD to guide clinical evaluation. Success in this Phase II proposal will be used to generate a Target Product
Profile (TPP), which will guide clinical protocol design, as well as aid in raising follow-on-funding and partnerships
for product development from multiple potential sources. Building on these results, Phase III will implement
defined dosage guidelines for IND-enabling Pharm/Tox studies with GMP-manufactured SP and thereby
progress towards submitting an IND application for clinical evaluation."
10835855,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is associated with a progressive loss of dendritic spines, microscopic dendritic
structures that serve as the sites of synaptic communication and are essential for the storage of memory. Levels
of the RhoGEF Ephexin5, a regulator of dendritic spine density, appear to be key in facilitating AD-induced
dendritic spine loss. Much about the substrate specificity of Ephexin5 and the regulation of Ephexin5 activity
remain unknown. The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms by which Ephexin5 signaling
occurs in normal physiology and disease. It is my hypothesis that E5 undergoes a phosphorylation-
dependent shift in substrate specificity from RhoA to Rac1/Cdc42, relevant to its role in regulating spine plasticity
and contributing to the physiology of AD. Using 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging coupled with genetically
encoded FRET biosensors, I will optically probe the activity of GTPases in live tissue. I will define the substrate
specificity of neuronal E5 under normal physiological contexts, and in a model of AD-induced cellular damage.
Using mass spectrometry, I will determine if phosphorylation of Ephexin5 changes during neuronal signaling or
in an AD-like cellular state, and using phosphomutant analysis I will examine how phosphorylation influences E5
substrate specificity. My results will further the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory
and have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for AD.
Training for this project will take place at UC Davis, with the support of my mentor and Sponsor, Karen Zito, an
expert in the live-imaging of synapses, and Co-sponsor James Trimmer, and expert in neuronal protein structure
and function. I will acquire key technical skills in advanced live-cell imaging and mass spectrometry, which will
aid in the completion of this research project. Additionally I will hone skills of mentorship, management,
communication, and writing."
10778195,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in western countries and represents the final common
clinical event of numerous cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac β2 adrenergic signaling determines cardiac output
and has been extensively studied as treatments directed toward β2 adrenergic signaling have proven effective
at improving cardiac performance and heart failure outcomes. The β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is a G-protein-
coupled receptor (GPCR), a family of membrane proteins representing the largest and most versatile group of
cell surface receptors. They are ubiquitous membrane proteins that facilitate the initial role in the transduction of
information into the cell via a wide array of extracellular signal-receptor interactions. Although much progress
has been made in elucidating conformational insights into ligand-mediated signaling of GPCRs, there has not
been commensurate investigation into endogenous modulators of GPCR signaling. Endogenous modulators
include but are not limited to protein-lipid interactions, post-translational modifications, and accessory protein
interactions. The β2AR has a site for S-palmitoylation, the covalent attachment of palmitate to a cysteine, in the
C-terminal helix 8 (H8). Interestingly, H8 of the β2AR is implicated in β-arrestin recruitment, resulting in a non-
canonical signaling pathway, yet little is known of the effect that palmitoylation of H8 has on intracellular signaling
and structural dynamics of the receptor. I hypothesize that S-palmitoylation of the β2AR has an allosteric
effect on the conformational plasticity therein modulating functional transducer coupling in the context
of ligand mediated protein activation. The goal of this project is to determine the effect S-palmitoylation has
on β2AR signaling in the following two specific aims. Aim 1. To define the impact of s-palmitoylation on the
conformational dynamics at the cytoplasmic surface of the β2AR and the effect it has on the interaction with
transducers to facilitate intracellular signaling using both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques
and signaling assays. In preliminary experiments, we performed site-directed spin-labeling to generate a set of
nitroxide spin labeled receptor mutants to perform EPR spectroscopy experiments. Aim 2. To determine the
impact of S-palmitoylation on H8 and tail dynamics of the β2AR using EPR techniques. These experiments will
help us better understand β2AR signaling as a whole and provide new insight into novel ways of GPCR signaling
regulation via endogenous modulators. Further, the experiments will provide new insight into the effects of S-
palmitoylation on the conformational plasticity and, ultimately, the signaling of the β2AR. These results will
provide a greater clarity on β2AR signaling and regulation within the context of a physiologically relevant cellular
environment, which will help with the design of effective treatments targeting cardiac β2 adrenergic signaling."
10765685,"Project Summary/Abstract
Effective parenting is a critical component of healthy child development. Ineffective parenting skills have been
implicated as contributing factors for childhood externalizing and internalizing symptoms, which may
significantly disrupt children’s functioning and extend into adulthood. Effective tools to assess parenting and
measure change in these domains over time will contribute to a more complete understanding of both
normative and atypical developmental pathways. Thus, there is a need for parenting measures that are brief
and low-cost, have strong psychometric properties and established norms, reduce social desirability biases,
are culturally inclusive, and are sensitive to change. To address the need for a measure that meets these
criteria, we have systematically developed the Knowledge of Effective Parenting Test (KEPT) over the past 10
years (K01MH093508; R21HD090145). In its current iteration, the KEPT is an online assessment for which
parents/guardians answer questions in response to 15 brief vignettes of both common and challenging
parenting scenarios. Developed for parents of children aged 5-12, the measure covers knowledge of parent-
management skills known to be associated with childhood disruptive behavior disorders, including age-
appropriate expectations, effective communication, planned-ignoring, rewards, consequences, attending to
positive behavior, and praise. This proposed project will build on our previous work by accomplishing three
new aims that will extend the utility and efficiency of the KEPT. Aim 1 is to develop new content for the
Knowledge of Effective Parenting Test (KEPT) for domains of parenting that are associated with the
development and maintenance of childhood internalizing symptoms. Aim 2 is to develop computer adaptive
test (CAT) versions of the KEPT-Internalizing (KEPT-I) and KEPT-Externalizing (KEPT-E) that are calibrated in
a nationally representative sample (N = 1,000). Aim 3 is to establish the reliability and validity of the KEPT-I
and KEPT-E in a symptomatic sample (N = 200) and healthy controls (N = 100) over a 12-month interval. This
measurement R01 will result in an expanded item pool for the KEPT with new content for domains of parenting
that are associated with the development and maintenance of internalizing symptoms, along with CAT versions
of the expanded test. This is important given the increasing rates of internalizing symptoms among school age
children, and because these symptoms often co-occur with externalizing symptoms and are frequently
underrecognized. The project has the potential to advance the way treatment developers operationalize and
measure parenting knowledge and skills. This proposed project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure
“that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.”"
10757049,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Background: There is a critical need to understand how disaster events affect individuals with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly around aging in place. Home health care is a critical
mechanism to support aging in place for individuals with ADRD, where these services allow older adults to
remain in their own homes for as long as possible. For people living with ADRD, the disruption in normal
patterns of daily living caused by a disaster can be highly disorienting and lead to acute changes in health and
well-being, leading to increased healthcare use. Our overall goal in conducting this project is to develop
strategies to support older adults with ADRD, and their caregivers, to age in place after a disaster—staying out
of the hospital and long-term care— through the use of home health care. We hypothesize that older
Americans with ADRD are at particular risk for poor health outcomes that result from the disruption of a
disaster, requiring increased healthcare resources at the end of life. Specific Aims: Aim 1 will determine
whether home health care use reduces reliance on conventional healthcare services following a disruption in
care (i.e., exposure to a disaster) among older adults with ADRD. Aim 2 will determine the extent to which
home health care use is associated with additional healthcare use at the end of life and the quality of care
among ADRD decedents, after a large-scale disaster. Project Methods: Using Medicare claims data, Aim 1
will identify older adults living with ADRD who use home health care, compared to those who do not using a
propensity score matching approach, then use difference-in-difference methods to assess the effects of home
health use in healthcare use (e.g., hospitalizations, emergency department visits) before and after a disaster.
In Aim 2, using the same sample as in Aim 1 we will limit to those who died 6 months after the disaster to
identify a decedent cohort, then assess the effects of home health use for end-of-life services during the last
six months of life by difference-in-difference methods. Unique Features and Innovation: Examining the use
of home health care in the intra-disaster period is an innovative method to begin to understand the ways in
which disasters affect individuals with ADRD, and can lead to better supports for this vulnerable group in future
disasters and other community emergencies. Examining outcomes of home health care users alone after
disaster can be problematic in that users by their nature of needing home care may require more use of
healthcare than those who do not use home health care. Studying this through a population of ADRD
decedents is innovative in that it levels this playing field. Anticipated Impact: The proposed study will fill
immediate and critical gaps in knowledge about the relationship between home health care and healthcare use
after disasters, and provide evidence for the use home health care as a strategy to support individuals with
ADRD and their caregivers to continue aging in place during a disaster."
10774333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal mental illness following childbirth is associated with substantial public health burden. Postpartum
psychopathology is a leading contributor of maternal morbidity and mortality and can endanger the child’s
wellbeing onward from birth. This suggests intergenerational effects. While efforts exist to reduce postpartum
depression, childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder (CB-PTSD), a condition that affects 240,000
American women each year, is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The adversity of CB-PTSD is demonstrated
by 1) the close temporal relationship between the onset of CB-PTSD symptoms and the birth of the infant, 2) the
child themselves becoming an unfortunate, constant reminder of the trauma (childbirth), which can distance the
mother from the child during an important time for the formation of mother-infant bonding instrumental for healthy
child development. Symptoms of PTSD follow a distinct triggering event and early signs appear in the period
after a traumatic experience, providing a unique opportunity for an intervention of targeted individuals during a
critical window when treatment could avert the PTSD symptom trajectory. This means that at-risk individuals
could be approached and screened in the hospital following childbirth and receive an early intervention to buffer
CB-PTSD symptoms and optimize mother and child outcomes. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we
identify individuals who have acute stress response in the hours following delivery indicative of risk for
subsequent CB-PTSD. They will be randomized to take part in a brief expressive writing (EW) about their recent
childbirth or about a neutral experience over 3 consecutive days starting from Day 5 postpartum (PP). We will
then follow them at repeated time points, to assess immediate (Day 8 PP) and sustained (Mo. 2) treatment
effects. Their infants will be studied at Mo. 2 PP to examine the influence of the intervention on the foundation
of mother-infant bonding. Maternal CB-PTSD will be quantified using psychodiagnostic, psychometric, and
psychophysiologic measures and mother-infant bonding using psychometrics and a behavioral observational
assessment of mother-child interaction. This study will begin to fill the critical clinical gap in interventions to
support maternal mental health following traumatic childbirth and enhance opportunities for maternal resilience
and psychological growth. Establishing an effective intervention, may lead to the implementation of a safe,
feasible, cost-effective therapy in hospital settings that is adherent to the special needs of mothers, thereby
reducing the odds of developing a potentially preventable, costly, posttraumatic disorder and fostering healthy
child development. In addition, the proposed study will further the NICHD missions that “women avoid harmful
effects from reproductive processes and children achieve healthy and productive lives.”"
10756932,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intellectual disability affects 2-3% of the population in industrialized nations, with genetic causes accounting for
approximately half of these cases. Whole genome sequencing has led to the discovery of several novel
pathogenic variants underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these variants, proteins involved in
chromatin post-translational modifications are highly represented. Variants in the polycomb repressive complex
1 (PRC1), the primary catalyst of histone 2A monoubiquitination (H2AUb1), illustrate this trend. RING1 and
RNF2 are paralogues that serve as the constituent E3 ubiquitin ligase of PRC1, and missense variants in these
genes that blunt H2AUb1 catalysis are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
microcephaly, intellectual disability, and early onset schizophrenia. The goal of this proposal is to understand
how pathogenic RING1 variants lead to disease genetically and molecularly. To explore the role of PRC1-
dependent H2AUb1 in the context of human corticogenesis, we have generated isogenic human embryonic
stem cell (hESC) lines harboring pathogenic variants in RING1 and subjected them to neural differentiation to
generate 3D cerebral organoids. Previous studies suggest that PRC1-dependent H2AUb1 has roles in
transcriptional repression and double strand break repair. Consistent with these previous reports, our
preliminary data demonstrates that the RING1G284A/G284A variant diminishes global H2AUb1 levels, leads to
increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and decreased growth in cerebral organoids, and disrupts double
strand break repair in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Aim 1 will explore the genetic mechanism of RING1
pathogenic variants, as experiments will shed light onto whether pathogenesis is due to lost activity of wild type
RING1 or due to a dominant negative effect of the mutant allele. Aim 2 will evaluate the molecular mechanism
by which pathogenic RING1 variants cause microcephaly. Experiments will evaluate NPCs and organoids
differentiated from hESCs harboring RING1 pathogenic variants for defects in DNA damage repair, increased
rates of apoptosis, and the ability to silence transcription at sites of DNA damage. Mechanistic insights learned
from these experiments will shed light onto the role of PRC1-dependent H2AUb1 in proliferating NPCs and in
maintaining genome integrity more broadly. In addition, the results of these studies will inform future efforts to
devise therapeutic strategies to restore these functions in individuals with pathogenic RING1 variants."

Organismal health requires a consistent and balanced internal environment known as homeostasis. Different
physiological processes maintain proper levels of biomolecules at a cellular level, and several of these
mechanisms lose efficacy with age. Proteostasis, sustained levels of correctly folded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), is maintained by the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Excessive misfolded proteins in the ER
activate the three branches of the UPR, facilitating adaptive processes to restore a balanced proteome in the
cell. Aging is associated with the loss of proteostasis and the accumulation of senescent cells – cells that no
longer replicate and secrete pro-inflammatory signals – that exhibit a dysfunctional UPR. The molecular
mechanisms underlying the altered UPR in senescent cells are unclear. We hypothesize that the liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS) dynamics of a nuclear biomolecular condensate, the nuclear speckle (NS), link cellular
senescence to the UPR. The 12-hour, XBP1s-dependent clock that functions independently of the 24-hour clock
or the cell cycle establishes 12-hour ultradian rhythms of NS LLPS dynamics. These rhythms regulate NS
morphology and fluidity through SON, the NS core protein. High SON levels create a diffuse, fluid NS and boost
the expression of UPR-associated genes. In contrast, low SON levels result in a spherical, stagnant NS and a
blunted expression of UPR genes. We have recently found that SON levels decrease, and that the NS becomes
more spherical during cellular senescence. These data suggest that changes to NS LLPS dynamics are
hallmarks of cellular senescence and aging. Here, we propose two aims to examine how NS LLPS dynamics
change in vitro during cellular senescence and in vivo throughout chronological aging. In the first aim, we will
use a mouse embryonic fibroblast line with a GFP-tagged NS that can be induced to enter senescence. This
model will examine how established 12-hour rhythms of NS LLPS dynamics change during senescence and how
restoring SON levels affects NS LLPS dynamics in senescent cells. We will also pharmacologically boost the
diffuseness of the NS to determine if its fluidity can be increased during senescence. The second aim will use a
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model with a GFP-tagged NS. We will examine how NS LLPS dynamics
change throughout aging and if genetic and pharmacological methods that make the NS more diffuse in
mammalian cells can similarly affect NS LLPS dynamics in C. elegans and boost proteostasis in aged organisms.
These aims will establish changes to NS LLPS dynamics as hallmarks of senescence and aging. Furthermore,
we intend to show that NS LLPS dynamics is a druggable target and that therapies could return the NS
morphology and fluidity to a pre-senescent state."

African countries: the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO), the
Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) and the University Teaching Hospitals (UTH) of Zambia, and the Ocean
Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to form an HIV-Associated Malignancy Research
Center (HAMRC) that focuses on the research gaps of the Kaposi sarcoma (KS) disease. Building on the
success of their previous collaborations, these institutions will synergize their efforts under one overarching
research theme that focuses on the KS disease spectrum, from detection, to care and outcomes, to
deciphering KS pathogenesis and immune response. The immediate goal is to 1) implement a program to
better integrate KS diagnostic, clinical and research activities within the HIV-1 care and treatment networks in
both countries; 2) define stage- and treatment-associated immunologic and metabolomics biomarkers across
the spectrum of KS disease presentation; and 3) define the magnitude and breadth of Kaposi sarcoma
herpesvirus (KSHV) latent viral reservoirs in tissues of KSHV infected people living with HIV, so that these
reservoirs could be targeted for prevention of viral reactivation to prevent KS. To achieve this goal and promote
synergy and coordination across partnering institutions, KEAAP will establish an Administrative Core, based at
LSUHSC-NO with satellite locations at UTH/CDH, and ORCI, that will provide the administrative support
needed to ensure that KEAAP’s three research projects, Shared Resource Core (Data Management and
Integration Core), and Career Development Core can accomplish their individual and collective goals while
functioning in an integrated and coordinated manner. The Administrative Core will pursue four specific aims.
1) Provide the administrative expertise and resources necessary to support the consortium’s research projects

series of operational processes designed to create a collaborative research environment, promote data sharing
and dissemination of results, and build capacity for increased self-sufficiency at cancer research institutions in
Tanzania and Zambia. 3) Provide communications infrastructure to engage key stakeholders, to promote the
consortium, and disseminate information and research outcomes that will inform healthy policy changes locally,
and globally. The organization of the Administrative Core is designed to be responsive, inclusive, and robust –
attributes that are essential to address the broad mission and complex relationships within KEAAP, among

10908995,"Despite more than a decade of implementing universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) remains the most common malignancy in people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWH), causing significant morbidity and mortality. Compared to the US, ART implementation in SSA has not
resulted in a significant reduction of KS cases. For many PLWH in SSA, the only connection to health care is
through HIV care and treatment centers (CTC). Lack of recognition of early KS by both CTC care providers
and PLWH, and ineffective connection to diagnosis, care, and treatment when the disease presents in the
setting of HIV management at CTC may foster late presentation and ultimately, poor outcomes. Compared to
cervical cancer, where screening and early detection approaches have been successfully integrated into HIV
care for PLWH, efforts to detect, diagnose, and treat KS early are lacking. Since KS presents mostly
cutaneous, coupling KS detection to HIV management as has been done in cervical cancer for early detection
should readily improve early KS detection, definitive diagnosis, and linkage to care. As services for HIV
management are conducted through CTCs throughout SSA, these community-associated structures are the
best platform to integrate KS interventions and can be leveraged to increase early-stage presentation, early KS
diagnosis, and early treatment initiation. In this study, we will implement an integrated education package to
raise awareness and to impart the skills for early KS detection and diagnosis to PLWH, health care providers,
and community workers. This package includes recurrent educational sessions at CTCs in order to enhance
detection, diagnosis, and to initiate KS treatment early to improve outcomes of PLWH. It will also include a
social network-based strategy to enhance the sustainability of such an implementation program. We
hypothesize that an integrated care approach will increase the number and proportion of PLWH detected with
early KS, thereby improving early KS diagnosis and treatment to improve KS outcomes. There are 3 Specific
Aims. 1) Implement KS education, early detection, diagnosis, and linkage to care program at CTCs in Tanzania
and Zambia. 2) To enhance and sustain early KS detection, diagnosis, and linkage to care program through a
community network-based respondent-driven sampling (RDS) strategy in Tanzania and Zambia. 3) To
evaluate the effectiveness of integrating early KS detection, diagnosis, and RDS strategy in existing HIV care
services for PLWH in Tanzania and Zambia. Together, this will determine whether sensitization of providers
and PLWH to a combined HIV care and early KS detection approach is efficacious and viable in the setting.
This study is significant, as it will increase the proportion of PLWH examined for early KS detection, diagnosed,
and linked to cancer care. It will also focus on empowering and equipping providers and PLWH to make more
informed health decisions. This can be readily adopted and scaled up in Tanzania and Zambia, and
subsequently in other SSA to facilitate early KS diagnosis and treatment."
10775782,"Project Summary - The role of liver progenitor cells in liver regeneration
Acute and chronic liver disease causes liver failure and is a growing cause for morbidity and
mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the magnitude of this problem. The liver
is a highly regenerative organ, yet the presence of a dedicated stem cell population remains
controversial. In our preliminary work, we describe a near-total hepatocyte ablation model in
zebrafish where organ regeneration is derived from biliary epithelial cells. Our objective here is to
characterize the functional implications and molecular mechanisms of EAE to affect organ
development. Our central hypothesis is that severe hepatocyte injury will reveal the facultative
stem cell potential of biliary epithelial cells. This process appears to be driven by EGFR, PI3K,
and mTOR signaling. Two Specific Aims are proposed to define the generation and contribution
of facultative hepatic stem cells. In Specific Aim 1 we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and
high-resolution imaging analyses after near-total hepatocyte ablation to investigate whether and
when biliary epithelial cells undergo transcriptional and morphological changes to become
hepatocytes. In the process, we will generate an inventory of all liver cells in the zebrafish and
determine evolutionary conservation of cell identity and function by comparison to murine and
human liver datasets. Specific Aim2 will determine the degree of biliary epithelial cell proliferation
hepatoblast transcription factors gene expression prior to hepatocyte differentiation and define
the signaling pathways involved in the generation, function and proliferation of this facultative
stem cell population. Identification of a signal like EGFR that can cause biliary epithelial cells to
become hepatocytes has significant therapeutic potential for patients with liver failure."

Given the central role of HIV incidence estimation in both surveillance and evaluation of HIV
prevention programs, it is essential to have reliable, inexpensive, and usable methods for
quickly estimating incidence in near-real time. This proposal aims to advance that goal by
capitalizing on our recent developments in using a spectrum of biomarker data and HIV
surveillance data to compute the complete posterior probability distribution of the time since
infection for recently diagnosed persons. We posit that such estimates contain not only more
accurate information about time of infection than standard binary classification (recent/long-
term), but that it also gives realistic confidence bounds on HIV incidence estimates as it
appropriately takes biomarker measurements and patient variation into account. We further
posit that an accurate HIV incidence estimate must take three components into account: 1) The
multi-assay algorithm (MAA)-adjusted time of infection (rather than the date of diagnosis or
simple recent/non-recent binary classification); 2) The number of undiagnosed persons living
with HIV (PLHIV) at a certain time (which may be diagnosed later); and 3) The number of HIV
positive individuals that move into the study population. Specifically, we will 1) Develop
laboratory protocols and algorithms for measuring and modeling individual biomarkers for
probabilistic estimation of time of HIV infection; 2) Combine biomarkers into a generalized MAA
for improved estimation of time of HIV infection and HIV incidence; and 3) Apply new MAA to
determine the duration of infection and estimate HIV incidence in different human populations.
Using large data, in total >13,000 patients with up to 7 different biomarkers determined, from
Sweden, USA, South Africa and Zimbabwe, we will establish longitudinal and single-time point
training data, as well as validation data, to develop validated, publicly available, methods to
estimate: 1) the full distribution of time since infection for individual PLHIV; and 2) population-
level HIV incidence based on either study-based samples or existing surveillance systems, and
changes thereof over time, using new biomarkers, algorithms and models."

Pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs) are devastating central nervous system malignancies. Despite decades of
investigation into these lethal childhood brain tumors, aggressive surgical resection combined with conventional
chemotherapy and radiation therapy remains the standard of care. Unfortunately, this treatment approach has
failed to improve the 5-year survival of patients with cortical HGGs, which continues to be less than 20%. The
paucity of curative treatment options for patients with HGGs emphasizes our urgent need to further understand
these disease entities at the cellular and molecular level for informed therapeutic approaches. The identification
of recurrent histone H3 mutations in pediatric HGGs by my mentor Dr. Suzanne J. Baker and others strongly
supports a critical role for epigenetic dysregulation in the etiology of childhood HGGs. Recurrent Gly34Arg/Val
substitutions in histone H3.3 (H3.3 G34R/V) occur in more than 15% of cerebral cortex HGGs found in
adolescents and young adults. The frequency of these mutations in a subset of cortical HGGs underscores the
functional significance of epigenetically dysregulated spatiotemporal gene regulatory programs during
development. However, the impact of H3.3 G34R/V on transcriptional regulatory programs contributing to
tumorigenesis in a distinct spatiotemporal context within the developing brain remains to be determined. This
proposal integrates the expertise of the Baker lab for functional and mechanistic studies in HGG with the
pioneering expertise of a group of collaborators who have identified and functionally validated transcriptional
core regulatory circuitries (CRC) and other critical tumor dependencies in models of pediatric cancer. By
combining cutting-edge genomic platforms and other experimental techniques with clinical training experiences
in pediatric neuro-oncology and neurosurgery, I intend to decipher complex transcriptional patterns dysregulated
in H3.3 G34R/V HGG to address current limitations in treating this intractable central nervous system
malignancy. The Baker lab established a novel collection of age and anatomically matched primary tumors,
patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, and a range of cell lines modeling wild-type, mutant, and CRISPR-
corrected H3.3 backgrounds for experimental interrogation of transcriptional dysregulation in HGG. Aim 1
leverages chromatin-based assays and RNA interference to identify transcription factors (TF) comprising a
transcriptional CRC essential to maintaining an oncogenic cellular state in H3.3 G34R/V HGG. Aim 2 employs
CRISPR/Cas9 negative selection screens to comprehensively target TF DNA-binding domains in patient-derived
cell lines from H3.3 G34R HGG and expands beyond core TFs comprising a transcriptional CRC to uncover
other critical TF gene dependencies in H3.3 G34R HGG. The identification of critical TF gene dependencies in
H3.3 G34R/V HGG will enhance our understanding of cancer cell dependency on transcriptional regulatory
programs and illuminate potentially actionable biology for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
10815569,"Project Summary – Abstract
 The perception of odors begins in the olfactory epithelium when odorant ligands bind to molecular
receptors expressed on the cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons, each of which expresses only 1 of ~1200
candidate receptors. As the sensory neuron axons exit the epithelium they progress over the surface of
the olfactory bulb and all of the axons coming from neurons expressing the same odorant receptor
converge into only 2/3 glomeruli/olfactory bulb. However, the convergence and discrete circuitry of the
olfactory bulb is not apparent in piriform cortex (PCX), at least grossly. Afferent projections to piriform
appear divergent and broadly distributed. Moreover, in contrast to the more widely studied neocortex, the
3-layer piriform paleocortex does not exhibit a definitive columnar structure, leaving open the question of
whether principles learned from neocortex can be applied to understanding piriform. Most of what we
know of the neuronal and synaptic organization of piriform has come from early studies of rat and opossum,
that while important did not benefit from contemporary genetic and molecular tools. The mouse, which
has emerged as the dominant mammalian model for studies of the olfactory epithelium and bulb, has
benefited immeasurably from these new tools. However, there are few examples of the application of
contemporary genetic and molecular methods to studies of mouse piriform cortex. We remain woefully
ignorant of the most fundamental features of mouse piriform cortex When do synapses first appear in
mouse PCX and when do they achieve laminar segregation? What is the organization of the ipsi- and
contralateral association axons that likely contribute to the cortical coding of odors in ensembles of
neurons? What are the molecular mechanisms/transcription factors underlying the fate and specificity of
PCX neurons/structure? To begin addressing these significant gaps in our knowledge we are proposing 3
specific aims: Aim 1 addresses the emergence of synaptic circuits in PCX and tests the hypothesis that
it occurs in a spatio-temporal format that distinguishes the laminar specificity of circuits. Aim 2 addresses
the PCX associational connectome, both ipsilateral and contralateral via the anterior commissure. Aim 3
tests the spatiotemporal expression of transcription factors (TFs) that we hypothesize are important in
establishing PCX pyramidal neuron identity and contributions to the association axon network in PCX.
Selective TFs will be knocked out using CRISPR to determine their role at a more granular level.
Collectively these innovative studies will provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating the
organization of PCX and the foundations of odor coding in PCX."

 Sleep disruption during college presents a significant public health concern, with studies documenting
clinically-significant sleep disruption in 40-60% of college students. Poor sleep contributes to rising anxiety,
depression, and loneliness as well as declining positive affect, motivation, and sense of purpose faced by
many students as they attempt to navigate a successful path through college. Disrupted sleep also negatively
impacts physical health, in part through upregulating inflammatory processes that can have acute and more
chronic effects on mental and physical health.
 In response, many colleges and universities have embarked on efforts to improve the sleep hygiene of their
students. The challenge is to identify programs that can simultaneously improve sleep, be delivered at scale,
and be easily completed by students. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), including a six-week Mindful
Awareness Practices (MAPs) intervention developed by our group, have been shown to improve sleep quality
and associated psychosocial and biological outcomes among adults. MBIs are well-positioned between
interventions targeting clinical insomnia (e.g., CBT-I) and mass-delivered sleep education programs, the latter
of which have been rolled-out by many universities despite evidence of limited effectiveness. Only four
published RCTs, however, have tested the effect of MBIs among college students and none targeted sleep as
a primary outcome.
 To address this important public health problem, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of 240 first-year college students at a four-year university that serves an ethnically and economically
diverse student population. Our two-arm, parallel group RCT will test the efficacy of the validated, group-
based, six-week MAPs intervention vs. sleep education, an active time and attention matched control
condition, for students who report poor sleep at this critical transition year. Effects will be assessed at post-
intervention and at 3-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups to assess persistence. Our project brings together a diverse
team with expertise in sleep, mindfulness-based interventions, and youth development to pursue four aims: (1)
determine effects of MAPs vs. sleep education on subjective and objective markers of sleep; (2) evaluate
effects of MAPs vs. sleep education on negative and positive psychosocial symptoms associated with sleep
disruption; (3) determine effects of MAPs vs. sleep education on inflammatory processes associated with sleep
disruption and relevant for long-term health; and (4) explore potential sex and ethnic variations in intervention
effects."

Retinal degeneration is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. All current treatments
for retinal degeneration, including experimental therapeutics like stem cell or gene
replacement therapy, are thought to be most effective when degeneration is caught in its
earliest stages. Unfortunately, the earliest detectable symptom of degeneration is often
visual impairment, which is only detectable after a large number of retinal cells have died
and disappeared. The ability to discern the first signs of cell stress, prior to apoptosis
and degeneration, could significantly improve the likelihood of delaying or preventing
vision loss. One common early indication of degeneration is activation of an immune
response, as the resident macrophages, called microglia, and infiltrating monocytes
migrate to and phagocytose injured neurons. The proposed research will utilize high-
resolution, in vivo OCT and AO-SLO imaging, flow cytometry, scRNAseq and
biochemical and immunohistochemical approaches to study the microglial response to
photoreceptor degeneration (Aim 1), the fates of infiltrating monocytes (Aim 2), and the
involvement of both cell types in re-establishing new homeostasis after dying
photoreceptors have been cleared (Aim 3). This work will contribute to the long-term
goal of monitoring and manipulating microglial dynamics in vivo so as to provide earlier
detection of and assessment of treatments for retinal degenerative disease."

 We propose to bring together an unparalleled team comprised of five leaders in metastatic cancer
research across five institutions (MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, MD Anderson at The
University of Texas, and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard University). The proposed MetNet Center
Administrative Core will be led by co-MPI Prof. Roger Kamm. The day-to-day administration of this grant will be
managed by the Center Administrator, located at MIT, who will be responsible for maintaining all records relative
to this award and will establish and monitor agreements with affiliated institutions. Additionally, center
administration will be supported by a Data Manager, who will be located at Harvard under the co-direction of Dr.
Franziska Michor. The Data Manager will sit on the Resource and Data Sharing Working Group of MetNet and
will be responsible for the co-development (in collaboration with the Center Administrator) of the MetNet Center’s
website, discussions regarding standard metadata fields, determine whether there will be pre-publication of data
sharing across the MetNet, create SOPs for MetNet data upload in conjunction with the different NCI Cancer
Research Data Commons, and lead the conversations about data quality control, cross validation, and
reproducibility. An External Advisory Committee (EAC) will be formed, bringing together investigators with
expertise in fields related to cancer metastasis and the tumor microenvironment. The EAC is envisioned as a
group of highly active members engaged to advise the MetNet Center leadership on scientific direction and
review progress evaluation, research strategies and implementation, leadership and dissemination, all in the
effort to maximize the impact of the center. The MetNet center will enhance the translational value and potential
impact of its research by engaging a Patient Advocate, who will be a member of the EAC as a reviewer and
evaluator of the pilot project grant applications, and will be invited to attend the monthly research webinars and
participate in the quarterly Co-MPI meetings, and the Annual Site Visit. To foster collaboration and further support
multi-institutional communication, wide reaching knowledge dissemination, and provide the MetNet Center
trainees opportunities for enhancing their technical and professional development skills, the Administrative Core
will support a virtual, monthly seminar series, and will offer intra-MetNet Center research exchanges and $50,000
pilot projects. In Aim 1 the Administrative Core will oversee and coordinate the project mission, establish
multidisciplinary project oversight and establish timeline milestones with videoconferencing and face-to-face
meetings. In Aim 2, we will develop, coordinate, schedule, and evaluate research meetings, research symposia,
and the visiting scientists’ programs that are critical to our research mission and dissemination. In Aim 3, we will
create the MetNet Center’s website to: facilitate communication on program achievements; act as the access
point for enquiries from external researchers; serve as publicly-facing source of accessible research results to
inform the breast cancer patient community; and serve as a central and accessible repository for all Center
generated protocols."
10911871,"Project 1: SUMMARY
Metastatic colonization requires that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) overcome the physical stressors and homeostatic
barriers that make successful metastasis an unlikely outcome. Very little is known about metastatic subpopulations, the
adaptations that allow them to circumvent homeostatic barriers, and the mechanisms used to cope with these stressors
and either proliferate or enter into dormancy. The intravascular environment is known to be inhospitable to CTCs, yet
several lines of clinical evidence indicate that physical interactions with activated platelets, fibrin thrombi, immune cells
and the formation of clusters with other cancer cells influences metastatic potential. Furthermore, the mechanism of
extravasation within the microvasculature is mediated by endothelial interactions, cytoskeletal forces, nuclear
deformations, and matrix proteolysis. It has long been recognized that metastatic tropism is determined by intrinsic
organ properties. We hypothesize that secondary colonization is the culmination of a sequence of low probability
events for which only a small subpopulation of CTCs has adapted to cope with these stressors. To investigate the
mechanisms of arrest, extravasation, and colonization we have developed in vitro vascular networks that recapitulate
the geometry and function of the microvascular networks where circulating tumor cells initiate metastatic lesions.
Importantly, we are able to precisely engineer the microvascular environment by controlling cellular constituents,
extracellular components, and the physical stressors to systematically distinguish the effect of specific perturbations on
cancer cell arrest, transmigration, and colonization with high temporal and spatial resolution. In Aim 1, we create
cancer cell thrombi and clusters to determine the effect of interactions with platelets, fibrin, and cancer cells on the
arrest, transmigration, and colonization. In Aim 2, we extend the capabilities of our microvascular platforms to
recapitulate the organ-specific microvascular environments of liver and dermis to examine combined effects of different
flow and endothelial barrier function. In Aim 3, we will use specific molecular interventions to target tumor cell
adhesion, contractility, nuclear deformability, and matrix degradation to quantify the effect on intravascular adhesion,
transendothelial migration, and long-term extravascular fate. In Aim 4, we will measure nuclear deformation and
quantify chromatin reorganization during transmigration and determine if quantitative measures of chromatin
reorganization fates extravasated cells to a dormant phenotype (Core B). Taken together, we hypothesize that
methodical in vitro observation combined with and validated by intravital studies (Project 2) and computational
modeling (Core A) will lead to new insights regarding the specific mechanisms that enable CTCs to circumvent physical
stressors. By engineering the physical environment, we will generate the knowledge leading to novel therapeutic
opportunities to block or reverse the coping phenotype."
10911875,"Project 2: SUMMARY
Organ colonization and survival of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) depends on a response program in tumor
cells (TCs), termed mechano-adaptation, to cope with mechanical and molecular stresses on the cytoplasm
and nucleus experienced during intravascular arrest and extravasation. The strength and duration of
mechanical stress differs in vascular beds among organs, such as liver and skin, and further differs between
individual-cell and collective organ colonization. Molecular systems implicated in the mechano-adaptation of
CTCs include coordinated cell-cell adhesions, cytoskeletal contractility, protease systems and deformation
or the nucleus, which cooperate to secure multistep movement into the secondary site and TC survival. We
hypothesize that successful metastasis in vivo depends on an adaptive interplay between the mechanical
and molecular intra- and perivascular stresses present at distant site and the coping ability of CTCs to
overcome these stresses. By coordinated cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeletal contractility, deformation of the
nucleus, and protease systems we predict that mechano-adaptation secures individual-cell and collective TC
survival and further mediates lasting reprogramming towards growth or dormancy. Consequently, we
anticipate that interfering with cell mechanical adaptation strategies will increase cell stress, support CTC
death and diminish metastatic organ colonization. By combining intravital microscopy in mouse models,
computational modeling (Core A) and transcriptomic and chromatin structure analyses (Core B), we will
address the rate-limiting steps of single-cell and collective organ colonization of triple-negative breast cancer
and melanoma cells to skin and liver. In Aim 1 we will examine the mechanisms of collective and single-cell
organ colonization and metastatic outcomes, by interfering with adherens junctions (p120-catenin) and
intravascular coagulation. In Aim 2, we will identify the rate-limiting steps of cytoskeletal and nuclear
mechanics and the ability to remodel the vascular wall during single-cell and collective organ colonization.
Targeted interference with CD44-mediated adhesion to perivascular substrate, actomyosin contractility,
nuclear deformability by lamin A/C expression variation and the ability to reorganize the basement membrane
will be performed. In Aim 3, we will identify the molecular responses underlying stress-induced mechano-
adaptation and associated effects on nuclear chromatin conformation, using transcriptomic and ultrastructural
analyses combined with computational modeling. Identified key pathways implicated in mediating mechano-
adaptation and TC survival, cell cycle arrest (dormancy) and outgrowth will be inhibited by combined
molecular interference to limit TC survival and both single-cell and collective metastasis. This project will
deliver an integrated view on cell migration, molecular reprogramming, fate decisions, and reveal potential
intervention points to enhance tumor cell elimination in transit."
10911881,"Computational Core (Core A): SUMMARY
To guide and interpret the in vitro (Project 1) and in vivo experiments (Project 2) and to provide a physical basis
for changes in transcriptional patterns in response to mechanical stresses (Core B), this core will employ an
array of computational tools spanning a wide range of length and time scales. These include models for cell
adhesion, cytoskeletal function, cell-matrix interactions and 3D multiscale models for nuclear mechano-
transduction and chromatin organization. This suite of modeling tools will reveal non-linear interactions between
cell and nuclear deformation during of extravasation and migration, mechano-adaptation in response to fluid and
solid stresses, intravascular and extravascular niche properties and cell death for individual compared to
clustered CTCs. Significantly, modelling of 3D genome organization will allow us to elucidate the relationship
between the mechanics of the cell, chromatin organization, and transcription, thus providing new insights on how
mechanical stresses regulate gene expression during metastasis, and identification of reversible and persisting
chromatin deformation associates with cell survival or death.
Cancer cells invade individually or collectively, but the factors that govern their strategies to colonize the tissue
and their ability to survive intravascular stress and extravasation are poorly understood. While the coupling
between cell contractility, nuclear mechanotransduction, and adhesive interactions with the ECM and vessel wall
is known to affect cell adhesion and motility, the effects of this interplay on cell survival has yet to be rigorously
investigated. To elucidate the physical mechanisms involved in such regulation, we developed 3D chemo-
mechanical models to describe the three-way feedback between the adhesions, the cytoskeleton, and the
nucleus. The model shows local tensile stresses generated at the interface of the cell and the extracellular
environment regulate the properties of the nucleus, including nuclear morphology, levels of lamin A/C, histone
deacetylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ, which in turn govern spatial chromatin organization,
gene expression and the ability of the cells to survive and cope with the mechanical stresses. Building on these
tools, the specific aims of this project are:
· Aim 1. Predict the role of vascular flow on tumor cell arrest and survival in the intravascular niche.
· Aim 2. Model the mechanochemical/molecular mechanisms of individual/collective extravasation
 of CTCs.
· Aim 3. Predict the influence of alterations in chromatin organization and transcriptional patterns
 induced by intravascular stress and extravasation on the survival and growth of migrating tumor
cells"
10829877,"Project Summary:
Illness behaviors, metabolic disturbances, and cognitive decline are common in patients with chronic systemic
diseases, and contribute substantially to quality of life and ultimate survival. Other illness-induced morbidities
including anorexia and lethargy also compromise the ability of patients to recover from life-saving or extending
interventions, and diminish the motivational drive to aggressively battle the underlying condition. Although
cachexia in cancer patients was described more than two thousand years ago, the central mechanisms
underlying this disorder are poorly understood. Furthermore, there is currently no effective pharmaceutical
treatment. Cognitive decline is common in all chronic diseases, and can be a presenting complaint in cancer
patients, even prior to initiation of therapy. Our laboratory is dedicated to unraveling the basic mechanisms
whereby cancer triggers neuroinflammation, a key driver of cachexia and cognitive decline in patients with
cancer. In this proposal, we will focus on understanding the scope and mechanism by which systemic illness
induces the production of a molecule called lipocalin-2, that in turn acts on the brain to cause loss of appetite
and cognitive decline. The significance of this proposal resides in its unique combination of our historical focus
on neuroendocrinology and neuroinflammation, with new collaborations and efforts directed at understanding
the extent and mechanisms of anorexia and neurocognitive decline in patients with cancer. The long-term goal
of our research is to gain mechanistic understanding of the acute illness response and how it is transitioned
into chronic neuroinflammation in all cancer types, in order to develop more effective therapeutic interventions."
10833049,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that assemble to activate caspase-1 in response to tissue damage
and infection by microbial or viral pathogens. Once activated, caspase-1 processes the inactive proforms of
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) to produce the active pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-
18, respectively. In addition, caspase-1 processes the gasdermin protein GSDMD to induce pyroptosis or
inflammatory cell death. The NLRP3 inflammasome is unique among the different inflammasomes in that it is
activated by diverse pathogen-associated and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs)
derived from infection with microbial pathogens, or tissue damage. As a result, uncontrolled NLRP3 activation
can lead to a number of human inflammatory diseases, including gout, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and type 2
diabetes. The mechanism of NLRP3 activation by these seemingly unrelated stimuli is poorly understood but is
currently believed to require two distinct signals; a priming signal or “signal 1” produced by Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) and an activation signal or “signal 2” that induces fragmentation of trans Golgi network (TGN) and
binding to NEK7. Studies in the applicant's laboratory demonstrated that signal 1 induces post-translational
modification (PTM) of NLRP3 at critical sites via the MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathways and partial
oligomerization of NLRP3. In this application, studies are proposed to elucidate how TLR-induced PTM
contributes to posttranslational priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome by employing mass spectrometry to
identify and characterize all critical changes in the phosphorylation and other PTM profile of NLRP3 induced by
signal 1, and investigating how these changes contribute to activation of NLRP3. Additional aims will
investigate the effect of signal 1 and signal 1-induced PTM on NLRP3 association with dispersed TGN and
NEK7, and identify the TGN-associated kinases required for final assembly and activation of the
inflammasome. Finally, preliminary evidence suggest that kinases involved in the regulation of intracellular ion
homeostasis exert negative control on activation of NLRP3 by signal 2. Thus, additional experiments will
investigate how signaling from these kinases in macrophages impacts NEK7 phosphorylation and interaction
with NLRP3, and how genetic deficiency in these kinases impacts NLRP3-mediated pro-inflammatory responses
to PAMPs and DAMPs in vivo. Results from this research will provide fundamental new insights into the pathways
that regulate the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the cellular mechanisms that control
its activation. Successful completion of this study should have a high impact on the field by providing a unifying
paradigm for how NLRP3 can be regulated by an exceptionally diverse group of activating stimuli. Understanding
these mechanisms is of great scientific and health significance as this should better our understanding of the
molecular basis of NLRP3-related diseases and should in the long term help in the development of therapeutics
to alleviate these inflammatory diseases."
10839766,"ALL blood-wetted devices, without exaggeration, are susceptible to unintended thrombosis and
bleeding – with dire consequences. In spite of decades of clinical experience, basic research,
and computational fluid dynamics modeling, it is still virtually impossible to avoid deleterious
hematological effects without anticoagulation, or experimental trail-and-error. The unfortunate
consequence is an unacceptable rate of debilitating adverse events such as stroke and
hemorrhage. This abiding challenge has driven the PIs over the past 25+ years to pursue a
deterministic, multi-scale, multi-constituent, convection-diffusion-reaction model of thrombosis
that embraces the principle elements of Virchow’s Triad: properties of blood, character of flow,
and surface chemistry. We have made significant progress in the previous phase of this project,
and now able to predict platelet deposition with remarkable accuracy at multiple scales: from
small crevices to full-sized ventricular assist devices. We now wish to extend the thrombosis
model to include thrombus stabilization, and remodeling. Specific Aim 1 will be to extend the
model to include fibrin cross-linking, endothelialization and pannus formation. We hypothesize
that these improvements will enhance the utility of the model for simulating the stability of
adherent thrombus, hence risk of embolization, the effects of thrombolysis and the development
of neointimal surface and/or pannus growth. Specific Aim 2 will be to incorporate biochemical
pathways to simulate commonly used anticoagulation, and greatly improve its clinical
translation. Specific Aim 3 will be to demonstrate the performance of the enhanced thrombosis
model with macro-scale devices over a range of clinically relevant conditions, including a rotary
blood pump with blood-immersed bearing, a catheter blood pump, a mechanical heart valve,
and a ventricular cannula. We will perform simulations parametrically, over a range of conditions
to produce a map of “Thrombosis Threat Level” within the device as a function of hemodynamic
and hematological independent variables: flow rate, platelet reactivity/count/pre-activation, and
anticoagulation. We further intend to package the model in a user-friendly, publicly available
application to promote dissemination of this resource for both designers and practitioners to
ameliorate one of the most pernicious and abiding complications of cardiovascular devices."
10833518,"Southern Africa is the epicenter of the HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, and South Africa is at the center of
the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. There is an urgent need for robust epidemiology and implementation science
to address the interacting burdens of HIV, TB, and other (emerging) coinfections and non-communicable
diseases (NCDs). The International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS in Southern Africa (IeDEA-SA)
has defined six specific aims for the fourth funding period (IeDEA-SA IV): (1) to study outcomes along the
continuum of HIV care in adults; (2) to study outcomes in pregnant women, infants, children, and adolescents;
(3) to study NCDs, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted infections (STIs); (4) to study the clinical and public health
epidemiology of TB; (5) to study cancer prevention, burden, and care; and (6) to study mental health and
substance use disorders. Further, we defined six cross-cutting themes: (i) the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on health services; (ii) gender equity; (iii) capacity building; (iv) digital transformation; (v) open science;
and (vi) the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which we will develop and prioritize within each
aim. Innovations include the addition of the Western Cape Provincial Health Data Centre (WC PHDC), the
South African HIV Cancer Match study, the establishment of pre-Exposure prophylaxis cohorts, and the
evaluation of novel technologies (for example, a point-of-care genome-sequencing device, a hand-held
colposcopic device for cervical cancer screening, or tools to study the transmission of TB in the health care
setting) and novel statistical and mathematical modeling approaches. Multiregional Sentinel Research
Networks (NCD-Sentinel Research Network [SRN], TB-SRN, Adolescent and Young Adult Network of
IeDEA) on NCDs, TB, and adolescents and youth will harmonize data collection across the six IeDEA regions in
low- and middle-income countries. The Fogarty-IeDEA Mentorship Program will strengthen capacity building
among early-stage investigators. IeDEA-SA now follows nearly 1.3 million people living with HIV, including
285,000 individuals from the private sector (the Aid for AIDS program AfA), and 370,000 with ART duration >
ten years. IeDEA IV will add data from 600,000 HIV-negative people through AfA and information from up to 4
million HIV-negative individuals from the WC PHDC in specific analyses. Within IeDEA, the Southern African
region includes by far the largest number of adults and children. The COVID-19 pandemic now highlights the
importance of epidemiologic research and implementation science across the health system. IeDEA-SA is well-
placed to address the specific aims and cross-cutting themes outlined in this application, through its successful
track-record of collaboration between the scientific and operational leadership at the Universities of Bern and
Cape Town, partnership with several African universities (including the Kwazulu-Natal Research Innovation
and Sequencing Platform), United States and European universities, and with the World Health Organization

Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly
using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently
perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in
counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional
conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation,
and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’
safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.
 No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner.
Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and
relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict.
The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no
chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to
counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic
counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.
 The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing
program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington,
DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and
counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making,
willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to:
1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to
 donate in a pre-post design
3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to
 longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.
 The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be
implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating
culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent."

Carotenoids, a class of dietary lipids, play critical roles in vision as precursors of retinoids (vitamin A and its
metabolites) and macular pigments. Emerging evidence suggests a beneficial interaction between carotenoids
and retinoids in the retina. Carotenoids may prevent retinoids to undergo blue light triggered photochemical
reactions that eventually can harm the photoreceptors and the adjacent retina pigment epithelium. However,
our knowledge about this process is limited and meaningful progress in this research field has been hampered
by a lack of suitable animal models. In recent years, our laboratory has established novel tools and reagents
that allow us to address three innovative aims.
In Aim 1, we will follow the hypothesis that blue light-dependent photo-isomerization of all-trans-retinal can
trigger a cascade of events that eventually damage the photoreceptors. We will study the biochemistry of these
reactions in the mouse retina and analyze whether chemical scavenging of retinaldehyde can prevent this
pathology. For Aim 2, we have established a mouse model that accumulates lutein and zeaxanthin in the
retina. The retina of these mice will allow testing of the protective role of carotenoids against light-induced
retinal damage and oxidative stress in a small animal model with striking similarity to humans in anatomy,
physiology, and genetics. In Aim 3, we will study the involvement of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase
BCO2 in the metabolism of bisretinoids and oxidized carotenoids. These compounds form as side products of
the visual process and can harm photoreceptors and the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium. We will study the
biochemistry of the reaction and test whether BCO2 is a modulator of disease states that are characterized by
the accumulation of bisretinoids. Understanding the chemistry and biology of carotenoids in vision is of
substantial research interest because of the beneficial roles of these pigments for ocular health."

Abuse of opioids is a public health crisis: in 2016, 2.1 million people had an opioid use disorder (OUD) and
more than 40,000 people died from an opioid overdose. There is clear evidence that people with OUD can be
effectively treated using medication and behavioral interventions such as counseling. Depending on the
severity of the addiction, treatment can occur in outpatient settings (e.g., office visits for individual therapy) or
might require more intensive care in inpatient settings such as residential facilities or hospitals. However, a
large share of people with OUD still do not receive optimal treatment.
Medicaid plays a crucial role in addressing the opioid crisis. It covers health care for almost 40 percent of
people with OUD, and state Medicaid programs provide a variety of OUD treatment services affecting health
outcomes for people with OUD. Some of these benefits are federally mandated (e.g., inpatient or ED services
in general hospitals), while others are optional (e.g., medications, case management) and determined by public
policy decisions at the state level. However, it is not clear what kind of policies are most successful in reducing
the number of opioid overdoses among Medicaid beneficiaries.
In 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued guidance allowing states to receive
federal funding to support substance use treatment through Section 1115 Medicaid waivers for “Institutions for
Mental Diseases” (IMDs), defined as facilities with more than 16 beds that specialize in mental health or
substance use treatment. In the absence of these waivers, federal law prohibits states from using federal
matching funds to pay for Medicaid services provided in IMDs. The waivers relax this prohibition, while
simultaneously requiring states implement a variety of other changes, including, for example, comprehensive
OUD coverage, opioid treatment guidelines and care coordination among providers. Currently, 27 states have
received an SUD waiver.
This application proposes a comprehensive mixed-methods assessment of the effects of the Medicaid SUD
waiver implementation. Our proposal has three aims. First, we use Medicaid claims data to examine the effect
of the waiver on health care utilization, including medication use over time (2014-2021) and across states.
Second, we assess the effect of the waiver on opioid-related overdoses. Third, we combine quantitative results
with qualitative data collection to identify waiver elements and contextual factors that were associated with a
successful reduction in opioid-related overdoses. The proposed research will provide critical information to
state Medicaid programs about public policies that are most successfully addressing the opioid crisis."

The University of Iowa (UI) Health Care strategic plan for 2022-2027 expressly challenges the institution to (1)
further expand clinical and translational science and research throughout our health care system, 2) build a
diverse clinical and scientific workforce and to (3) enhance healthcare across the state through innovations in
the systems of clinical and translational science (CTS) as well as clinical care. The Institute for Clinical and
Translational Science (ICTS) is the scientific home for the CTS infrastructure and many of the training
programs that support the university and is the entity charged with integrating CTS into the health care and
research environments at the UI. As we envisioned the K12 program, we used the UI Health Care strategic
goals to design a program that meets the needs of our state and that trains a CTS workforce to accelerate the
pace of scientific discovery driving science from the bench to the bedside and into the community. Nearly 40%
of Iowa's population lives in rural regions of the state where access to health care is challenged and many
disease outcomes are inferior to those seen in urban populations. Resolving these rural disparities requires
scientific and health care approaches that can adapt to geographic distance and make use of the existing
systems of care that are in place in sparsely populated areas. Health delivery in rural Iowa is dependent on
team-based care that incorporates allied health providers such as pharmacists, physical therapists, mid-level
practitioners, dentists and importantly, community services. Our research agenda addresses the need to
engage rural populations in practical ways closer to their homes and to train our scientists to work in
multidisciplinary teams that include and value integration of community and allied health providers into
research. Accordingly, our K12 program intentionally solicits Scholars from all health professions.
The Objectives of our K12 Program are
 1) Recruit and train outstanding Scholars (currently junior faculty or postdoctoral fellows with a pending
 faculty appointment) who will engage in an individualized curriculum and in mentored health care
 research during a three-year period in this multidisciplinary, multicultural K12 program.
2) Enhance the mentoring environment for translational research Scholars through a robust program for
 both mentors and mentees built on the NRMN training platform.
3) Provide a highly focused mentored research experience that fosters Scholars' successful transition to
 independence and continued engagement as leaders of translational health care teams.
Meeting these objectives will require continued campus-wide, multidisciplinary participation of faculty as
members of mentoring teams for K12 Scholars. Additionally, the ICTS, home of the only CTSA in the State of
Iowa, will collaborate with CTSA hubs across the United States to enhance the learning environment and
increase the opportunities for our K12 Scholars to build successful careers in translational science."

The goal of the Harvard Catalyst K12 program is to create an environment for early-stage clinical and
translational (CT) investigators that facilitates their career development and encourages paradigm-shifting,
diversity-focused interdisciplinary collaboration and team-based research approaches to advance CT science.
Since its founding in 2008, the Harvard Catalyst KL2 program has served as the cornerstone across Harvard
Medical School (HMS) and its affiliated academic medical centers for training our most outstanding early-stage
CT investigators. Given the demonstrated success of the KL2 program since 2008, the new K12 program will
build on the KL2 program's strengths. The new K12 program will specifically seek to help train and develop the
future leaders of CT science by leveraging the Harvard Catalyst cores and integrating the scholars into the
broader CT infrastructure at Harvard Catalyst and the CTSA consortium. In addition, through dedicated funding
from the HMS-affiliated AMCs, the K12 program will continue to be paired with the Catalyst Medical Research
Investigator (CMeRIT) program to further enrich the K12 learning environment. Moreover, through the continued
growth and expansion of the Clinical and Translational Research Academy, a supporting infrastructural
element of Harvard Catalyst, the K12 will create a community for CT investigators and enhance the transition
to independence for all K awardees across HMS. Finally, the K12 program will work closely with the Harvard
Catalyst Cores and other NIH-funded programs at HMS to enhance the research capability, competency and
performance of all K12 awardees with a new focus on translational science. The overarching objective of the
program is to ensure and nurture the sustainable careers of early-stage CT investigators and ultimately advance
translational science. The K12 program will offer sustained protected time for scholars to advance their CT
research, overseen by a primary mentor and co-mentor and now further enhanced by a dedicated mentorship
committee, including a separate career mentor to provide outside input on broader career goals. Training will
include the use of new courses and programs, including our monthly Translate Together curriculum, that covers
the broad translational spectrum and focuses on developing innovative solutions that improve human health. It
will also include the development of individualized career development programs, leadership training, visibility
through participation in the national CTSA Visiting Scholar Program, and mentor/mentee training, to ensure the
success of each scholar as a translational scientist as envisioned by NCATS. The K12 will also seek to educate
scholars on the importance of community engagement for the execution of effective CT research to ensure the
highest quality science can be completed. In a related context, building on our earlier success in improving the
diversity of the KL2 program, we will continue several diversity and inclusion initiatives both to ensure that we
have a vibrant and diverse group of scholars but also to ensure that all scholars are fully educated on diversity
as a critical feature of all successful CT research endeavors."

Programmed cell death (PCD) and has vital roles in organismal health and is essential to normal development.
Apoptosis is genetically programmed and mutations in regulatory genes contribute greatly to cancer therapy
resistance. Timely clearance of cellular debris following cell death is also critical as defects lead to inflammation
and are linked to autoimmune disease. Most cells in the body are highly differentiated and have intricate
morphologies. This presents challenges in the execution of cell death and clearance, as the subcellular
architecture and microenvironment of different compartments of the same cell may differ vastly. Complex cells
can die as a whole or in part. In the case of region-specific degeneration, cellular extensions are exclusively
dismantled leaving the rest of the cell intact. For neurons, such pruning is important in establishing appropriate
connectivity and thus for proper brain function. The central question addressed here is how morphologically
complex cells are eliminated. The C. elegans tail-spike cell is a valuable model to study complex cell
degeneration, dying through an elaborate, likely universal, compartment-specific program of cell death during
embryonic development. We have termed this remarkable program Compartmentalized Cell Elimination (CCE),
which also occurs in a set of sex-specific neurons, suggesting this may be a universal program of death. The
tail-spike cell also shows differential genetic regulation at the levels of both compartmental killing and clearance.
As such, a study of this single cell can provide insights on many facets of cell elimination. This proposal
leverages the fact that the tail-spike cell can be studied in its native context in the living animal as well as the
facile genetics of C. elegans to tackle three broadly related overarching questions: How does mitochondrial
trafficking influence cell process elimination? What novel genes govern CCE and hence cell death and removal
broadly? What novel genes regulate CCE in other complex cells, such as neurons? We will perform advanced
cell biological and genetic studies to address these questions. The proposed experiments, by illuminating
fundamental principles of basic cell biology, will advance the field of cell death in several ways. They will
identify novel regulators of PCD and clearance; they hold the potential to help devise targeted therapies against
cell-death-related disease, including cancer, neurodegeneration, immune and developmental disorders."

Dynamic Causal Learning for Neuroimaging
A Project Description
A.1 Introduction
Many analyses of fMRI and other neuroimaging data aim to discover the underlying causal or commu-
nication structures that generated that activity.1,2 An accurate characterization of these brain structures
is important for understanding neural circuits, systems-level neuroscience, and the neural bases of var-
ious cognitive psychological phenomena or mental diseases. Brain structures learned from neuroimag-
ing data also provide a powerful diagnostic tool for predicting everything from the concepts currently in
one’s mind3–5 to whether one suffers from different mental diseases.6–10
 Given the importance of such brain connectivity networks, it is unsurprising that a wide variety of
learning algorithms have been developed for different neuroimaging modalities. In particular, many of
these methods aim to infer the underlying causal or connectivity networks from data (in contrast with
model comparison methods such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM)11). These network discovery
methods have achieved some notable successes,2,6,12–21 but have also largely failed to address two
issues that can impede our ability to achieve improved understanding of the full, working brain. Our
project will develop, validate, and apply methods that solve both of these challenges.
 First, existing brain connectivity inference methods can be roughly divided into two groups: static me-
thods that do not actually treat the brain as a dynamic system (e.g., IMaGES22 and most of the ap-
proaches tested by Smith et al.23); and dynamic methods that explicitly measure and model the dy-
namics of the brain. Static methods obviously fail to use all of the available information. In contrast,
dynamic methods use the full structure of the measurements, but essentially all such methods24–28
infer causal and connectivity structures at the timescale of the measurement modality, rather than at
the brain’s causal timescale. However, the networks learned from data at the measurement and brain
timescales can be quite different, even given solutions for all of the other statistical and measurement
problems facing neuroimaging analysis.29 Moreover, the important facts about causal or connectivity
structure are frequently about which brain regions communicate directly with which other brain re-
gions, which requires a focus on the brain timescale, not the measurement modality timescale. It is
thus scientiﬁcally critical that we have methods that can determine the causal connections that exist
at the timescale of the underlying neural systems, not just those that are found at the timescale of our
particular neuroimaging methods.
 Second, there are multiple neuroimaging measurement modalities, each with their own strengths
and weaknesses. There are obvious and widely recognized advantages of multimodal information
fusion: 1) access to multiple, richer datasets, larger sample sizes, and improved estimation quality;
2) improved spatial coverage of the brain compared to fast dynamic modalities alone; 3) improved
dynamic coverage of the range of signals that are informative about interactions of brain networks; and
4) enhanced estimation quality and reductions in modality-speciﬁc deﬁciencies due to complementary
aspects of different modalities. These advantages are heavily exploited for feature and representation
learning; our group has been highly active in this ﬁeld.10,30–37 However, to our knowledge, no methods
have been developed and validated that can learn causal information (effective connectivity) using data
from multiple modalities. There exist machine learning methods (developed by members of our group)
that can combine causal information from disparate datasets,38–41 but these methods have never been
applied to multimodal neuroimaging data. Moreover, use of these methods to combine spatially precise
(e.g. fMRI) and dynamically precise (e.g. EEG, MEG) modalities requires a theory of the differences in

Circadian clocks are time-tracking systems that allow organisms to adapt to the time of day, and drive many
cellular functions. Their alteration can lead to various diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and metabolic
disorders. In this work, we propose development of a chemical biology toolbox, consisting of both imaging and
protein-targeting platforms to facilitate studies of circadian rhythms at the molecular level that have otherwise
not been possible. The core clock is comprised of a transcriptional-translational feedback loop with multiple
protein components, including paralogs. Disparities have been observed between promoter activity and protein
translation, among responses of core clock components to stimuli, and compensatory mechanisms resulting
from knock-down and knock-out strategies. To address these gaps and facilitate additional studies of the
molecular clock, we will use chemical biology-based strategies to: 1.) generate orthogonal chemiluminescent
scaffolds to track promoter activity and protein translation of multiple circadian genes in a parallel, high-content
manner; and 2.) develop small molecule and protein-based tools to directly target circadian proteins and their
interactions.
For studies of the molecular clock, it is essential to track circadian rhythms and target core clock proteins in a
dynamic and selective manner. Firefly luciferase-based reporters have been used to assess promoter activity of
individual circadian genes, and most protein-based studies involve cells derived from a single luminescent
mouse model. We will use orthogonal chemiluminescent probes (Nano-lanterns) to develop a multi-signal
platform to simultaneously track and associate promoter activity and protein translation relationships among
multiple genes. Perturbation of circadian proteins is also essential for understanding mechanisms, including
paralog roles. Currently, there are few options outside of genetic approaches, which can result in unilateral
changes and activation of network compensation mechanisms. Molecular tools offer the ability to directly target
the functional components of the clock – proteins, and/or their interactions. While small molecules present an
attractive approach, relatively few exist that directly target core clock proteins. Hence, we propose to generate
new agents for interrogating the circadian clock system: we will repurpose validated clock protein-binding small
molecules by synthetically converting them into protein degraders (PROTACs), and use yeast surface-display to
identify nanobodies that bind circadian proteins and prevent specific interactions. Together, these approaches
present a powerful means to understand the mechanisms of the circadian clock, and can be used in a variety of
models and in studies of diseases, including to uncover new therapeutic targets."

 Since its inception in 2011, the Martin Delaney Collaboratory program has made important advances towards
a cure for HIV. In response to the Martin Delaney Collaboratories (MDC) for HIV Cure Research RFA, we seek
to continue to advance the field by discovery of successful modalities to cure HIV infection. We will expand our
expertise and work toward a better understanding of persistent HIV infection, the discovery of novel approaches
to disrupt latency, methods to clear the HIV reservoir, and identification of strategies to control viral rebound. By
building on the significant advances that we have made to develop, implement, and execute a suite of pre-clinical
experiments that represent the most advanced and novel concepts, we will continue to pursue our central
unifying hypothesis that reversing HIV latency such that viral proteins are expressed, in parallel with interventions
that speed the clearance of cells emerging from latent infection, will ultimately lead to eradication of persistent
HIV infection. In parallel to the efforts to clear the infection, we will pursue interventions to prevent rebound of
viremia after ART interruption. We will leverage a broad portfolio of tools from both academic and industry
partners, and apply new discoveries, demonstrating proof-of-concept for clinical initiatives.
 We will engage academic scientists and clinicians, industry investigators, and the community to a) define
novel targets to destabilize proviral genomes that persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) b) define novel
approaches to block proviral establishment c) develop and deploy novel effectors to clear viral reservoirs, d)
delineate effective strategies to prevent rebound viremia that might emanate from such reservoirs after ART is
discontinued and e) create bridges to the community to improve the understanding of and access to HIV cure
research and clinical trials. Our initial efforts will focus on biology discovery to illuminate new host targets for
latency reversal, and the validation of the novel biological concept of latency prevention. Universal strategies for
proviral control or clearance will be developed and tested, including those based on HLA-E targeting, eCD4, and
CD4 mimetics. Our major recent advance in latency reversal via NF-kB signaling will be further developed in
both non-human primate and humanize mice models, in combination with candidates to clear infected cells.
 We envision an iterative process with insights gained in ex vivo and pre-clinical studies, carried forward to
enhance the next step in clinical development and, importantly, fed back to scientists to validate assays or
hypotheses, and explore new directions. As we have done in the past, we will develop human clinical trials to
address questions and test concepts developed in our work through funding mechanisms distinct from CARE.
We are dedicated to working together in a nimble program, with our research direction following our discoveries.
Together we will catalyze advances that will ultimately lead to the eradication of HIV infection."

The proposed program aims at the development of a new synthetic platform for controlled selective
functionalizations of aliphatic molecules possessing unreactive C(sp3)–H bonds. The existing synthetic
methods toward complex molecules and pharmaceuticals mostly rely on employment of pre-functionalized
substrates. Employment of non-functionalized saturated hydrocarbon groups is much more appealing as these
moieties are much more abundant and cheap. Moreover, the aliphatic C(sp3)–H bonds are often present in
complex biologically important molecules and pharmaceuticals, and thus their selective functionalization offers
a powerful tool for late stage modifications. The few existing methods for functionalization of saturated groups
are not general, as the functionalization site is usually substrate-controlled. Also, these methods operate under
acidic conditions and/or employ external oxidants, which limits the substrate scope. Thus, mild regio- and
stereo-controlled functionalization of saturated groups remains a holy grail in modern synthetic chemistry. We
propose the development of a novel visible light-induced transition metal-radical hybrid catalytic methodology
for regiocontrolled, mild, and external oxidant-free functionalizations of saturated groups. The site of
functionalization will be controlled by a designed tool-kit of temporary auxiliaries, which potentially in one-pot
fashion will be routinely installed onto substrate and removed from the product. The feasibility of a successful
development of this project is supported by a vast amount of preliminary results obtained in our lab. The
proposed project consists of three major Sections: 1. Development of efficient catalytic systems for
functionalization of aliphatic groups. 2. Development of a tool-kit for general efficient and site-controlled
proximal and remote functionalizations of various organic molecules. 3. Implementation of novel reactivity of
transition metal-radical hybrid complexes under development toward new transformations including C(sp3)–H
functionalizations and cascade reactions."
10800790,"Abstract - Remote Monitoring and Detecting of Tardive Dyskinesia for Improving Patient Outcomes
Tardive dyskinesia (TDD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by
involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking,
TDD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely
aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TDD. Early detection of TDD is
critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. What interventions are implemented is intimately
tied to knowing the patient’s medication adherence. It is difficult for the most qualified diagnosticians to
devote the 20-25 minutes of in-person time at the 4 to 6 times per year frequency necessary to provide every
patient the 1) “active monitoring,” 2) discussion of results, 3) changes to medication and instructions expected
with the urgent demands on every mental health professional today. This is increasingly challenging with the
increase in telemedicine and patient populations and decreasing human resources due to the pandemic.
Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements
are permanent. Currently, there are 200,000 individuals taking anti-TDD medications costing $60K and $105K
annually and this is increasing rapidly each year. A method for automatic TDD detection and accurate adherence
would enable timely intervention and avoid patient stigma, lower quality of life, and expensive ongoing treatment
for permanent TDD.
Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2020 and the reported prevalence of TDD is between 13% and
24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore,
prevention and early detection are key to managing TDD. However, current methods for monitoring patients
require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant but undertrained patients
and their families. Therefore, strong market potential exists for an automated remote adherence monitoring and
TDD detection system. Our go-to-market strategy is presented in the commercialization plan.
This Phase II project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies
that in Phase I demonstrated up to 77% discrimination in categorizing individuals with TDD compared to a 3-
person panel of trained clinical professionals evaluating the same video materials. Based on a power analysis of
the Phase I data, we propose here to extend collection and analysis of an additional 300 video recorded AIMS
and 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with
individuals living with diagnosed TDD and the other without a diagnosis of TDD. The participants in the study will
be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially
representative sample.
The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to finalize and deploy a powerful
supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TDD. The detection tool will be
created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as
the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the
amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TDD positive and TDD negative
participants in the control set.
Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing
smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of medication adherence, the other
critical component required for clinical intervention. The iRxReminder platform links patients directly to
researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface
can be easily used. This Phase II project will then use the iRxReminder platform for use in supporting the self-
management and TDD and other symptoms monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic
mental illnesses. With feasibility established in Phase I, we propose a six-month long clinical trial where
participants will 1) be monitored for early detection of TDD (and confirmation of not having TDD, thus avoiding
unnecessary diagnostician time) along with 2) goals for high adherence, 3) improved control of symptoms and
side effects, and 4) more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. Statistical tests of
the ease-of-use by patients and the care team will be conducted. The impact on revenue, treatment trajectory
(number of side effects detected and medication changes made) will be assessed. The success of the algorithm
to detect TDD compared to a human assessment at the end of 6-months of monitoring will be a final field test of
the technology."

Anhedonia—the diminished capacity to experience pleasure from normally pleasurable stimuli—is a
transdiagnostic symptom of multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and post-
traumatic stress disorder. The recent and rapid growth of anhedonia research is fueled by its alarming clinical
presentation: anhedonia is independently associated with increased risk of suicide, treatment resistance, and
reduced quality of life. Major depressive disorder and schizophrenia—disorders of which anhedonia is a cardinal
symptom—are linked with increasingly high levels of economic burden related to substantial health care costs
and unemployment. There is currently no clear biological definition of anhedonia. As a result, clinicians rely on
self-report measures with no clear established connection to its underlying neurobiology. While behavioral
reward processing deficits and dysfunctional reward circuitry have been observed in anhedonia, in-the-moment
reward responding is frequently preserved, suggesting that memory for the value of the experience may be
compromised. This prompts the central question of this proposal: to what extent is anhedonia a memory
problem? We propose to test a memory-based account for anhedonia as part of our goal to biologically define
the construct. We note that while it is unlikely that memory is the only basis for anhedonia (certainly there are
clear experiential aspects), it may be an understudied and underappreciated player. Critically, a well-defined
memory contribution can help identify novel treatment targets and pave the path to improving clinical practice
with biologically informed decision-making. We use a computational psychiatry approach, combining
mathematical modeling of behavior in novel paradigms with advanced neuroimaging and AI tools to identify and
validate biomarkers relevant to the prevention and treatment of anhedonia. We unite computational models of
value, reinforcement learning, and episodic memory, bridging across the RDoC domains of Positive Valence and
Cognitive Systems. Our aims are to: (1) Test the impact of anhedonia on value-modulated episodic memory and
its neural mechanisms using high-resolution whole brain fMRI; (2) Test the impact of anhedonia on memory-
guided decisions for reward and the associated neural mechanisms using high-resolution whole brain fMRI; and
(3) Test the impact of anhedonia on structural and functional connectivity measures as well as autonomic
regulation. We will also use AI/ML tools to create a multimodal library of predictive biomarkers for anhedonia.
Our ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive, mechanistic, and actionable memory-based account for
anhedonia using new paradigms, computational models, high-resolution neuroimaging, as well as artificial
intelligence approaches to develop novel interventions and improve clinical practice."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are >200 bp in length and bear no protein-coding potential. About 27,000
lncRNAs have been identified so far, most of which have versatile or unknown biological functions. LncRNAs
have cell-type-specific expression that responds to environmental stimuli and developmental cues. lncRNAs
may serve as molecular signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds during their regulatory processes. Some
lncRNAs are known to play important roles in development and diseases. Thus there is clear potential that they
participate widely in the regulation of chromatin states and gene expression. Mapping of lncRNA binding sites
in the genome is particularly important for understanding their regulatory roles. Over the years, a number of
methods were developed to study genome-wide lncRNA-chromatin binding. ChIRP-seq (Chromatin Isolation
by RNA purification) uses antisense DNA oligonucleotide probes to capture crosslinked and fragmented
chromatin-lncRNA complexes before the purified genomic DNA is sequenced for lncRNA binding locations.
Although ChIRP-seq has been gaining popularity, the method is plagued by several major issues including
requirements of a huge number of starting cells, lncRNA overexpression, and tedious manual operation. In this
project, we will develop a low-input version of ChIRP-seq that allows testing using 10K-100K starting cells,
compared to tens of millions of cells required by current ChIRP-seq assay. This microfluidic ChIRP-seq
technology will pave the way for studies in primary cells and tissues with endogenous lncRNA level and native
lncRNA-chromatin interactions that bear direct biomedical relevance. Furthermore, the dramatic decrease in
the required input will also allow cell-type-specific profiling of lncRNA binding which is critical for understanding
cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Our microfluidic technology offers much more reproducible, precise
and effective manipulation of magnetic beads during pulldown of lncRNA-chromatin complexes than manual
operation. The platform also offers fully automated and high-throughput processing, which will be important for
the eventual processing of a large number of patient samples in clinical setting."

or shift immunotherapy paradigms to proactively attack potential metastases.
Recent studies highlighted the role of B cells in immune regulation of tumor progression, as tumor-
infiltrating B cells positively associated with improved responses to immunotherapies and
favorable prognosis. However, the co-existence of both anti- and pro-tumorigenic B cell
populations during cancer progression complicates the approach to studying the functions of
tumor-infiltrating B cells. Since immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies mediate clearance of
pathogens and tumor cells with high affinity and specificity and we recently showed that IgG
antibodies target specific gut bacteria, modulating the gut microbiome at steady state, we propose
a focused approach to dissect the role of humoral immunity in anti-tumor responses during tumor
progression. We hypothesize that the interplay between IgG and gut microbiome will be critical in
hindering well defined, sequential steps during tumor progression by shaping the tumor immune
microenviroment as well as systemic anti-tumor responses. Thus, we will use a novel model of
immunoglobulin G (IgG) deficiency developed by Dr. Zeng to dissect the specific role of IgG
production in hindering tumor progression, independent of that of other B cell functions, and to
investigate how IgG response to the tumor modulates the gut microbiome and thereby affecting
anti-tumor immunity. The role of immunoglobulin G in tumor progression has not yet been
systematically evaluated, especially during the pre-metastatic, micro-metastatic or macro-
metastatic stages of tumor metastasis. Moreover, the interplay between the gut microbiome and
B cell subsets, the development of anti-tumor humoral immunity and memory B cell repertoires
remain unexplored. We propose that combining the novel animal model lacking IgG with well
characterized tumor models and comprehensive phenotypic and functional characterization of
relevant immune subsets will allow this interdisciplinary team to dissect the role of antibodies in
cancer progression and determine how the interplay between the gut microbiome and IgG shapes
anti-tumor immunity and cancer progression."
10738786,"Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi) are protozoan pathogens that
cause malaria. Of the five species of Plasmodium that infect humans, P. falciparum and P. knowlesi both involve
the sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in the deep tissue microvasculature and both cause a range of
disease severity. The goal of the proposed study is to understand how fluctuations in the oxygen concentration
in the microenvironment, which varies across tissue sites in the body, affect the multiplication rate of P.
falciparum and P. knowlesi. The findings from this study are significant toward our understanding of antimalarial
drug resistance, as some of the most important antimalarial drugs have been shown to work by triggering
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the parasite, and in vitro studies of drug-resistant Plasmodium under
different oxygen concentrations have shown variable results. While it is well-known that Plasmodium grows best
in the laboratory under low oxygen conditions, little is known about the biology of the parasite under higher
oxygen conditions. Our preliminary in vitro data suggests that P. falciparum replicates significantly slower at 13%
oxygen (mimicking the oxygen concentration in lungs and liver) versus 1% oxygen (mimicking the oxygen
concentration in brain and bone marrow). Confocal imaging suggested lower mitochondrial activity in the 13%
condition. Here in Aim 1, we will characterize the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying the variability
in multiplication rate under different oxygen conditions, studying this phenomenon in diverse species and strains
of Plasmodium. We hypothesize that as oxygen in the microenvironment increases, an increase in intracellular
ROS and cellular damage follows, leading to a decline in multiplication rate. In Aim 2, we will directly test whether
the parasite’s redox balance affects Plasmodium multiplication rate, through manipulation of ROS and P.
falciparum’s glutathione antioxidant system. While much focus exists on characterizing genetic mutations
underlying drug resistance, very little work explores the host environmental factors that may also play a role in
the redox balance of the parasites, which may in turn contribute to antimalarial drug efficacy in vivo."
10852866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a type of fluorescence imaging technologies that is
gaining popularity in biomedicine because it delivers the most direct insight into the molecular conformation and
the biological environment of a fluorophore. FLIM has been applied to provide insights into the cellular
metabolism, protein-protein interactions, and biological environment monitoring of temperature, viscosity, pH,
and ion concentration. Despite the wealth of information provided by the FLIM, its widespread application is
currently limited by the low imaging speed. The FLIM imaging speed is a complex function of many factors, with
shot noise by the photon counting statistics being the fundamental limit. This limitation is especially dominant for
fluorophores with lifetime shorter than the FLIM instrument response function (IRF) when deconvolution is
necessary to accurately determine the fluorescence lifetime. Thus, to fundamentally enhance the FLIM imaging
speed, either an increase of the maximum photon counting rate or a reduction of the FLIM IRF is necessary.
 Time-domain FLIM with high photon efficiency can be implemented with either time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC) or photon counting streak camera (PCSC). The maximum photon counting rate of state-of-
the-art time-domain FLIM is 1-10 mega counts per second (Mcps), limited by the pile up effect in TCSPC-FLIM
and the readout nonlinearity and crosstalk in PCSC-FLIM. TCSPC-FLIM generally has a 100-ps IRF, unless
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors that require cryogenic cooling are implemented to reach the
picosecond regime. On the other hand, PCSC-FLIM can achieve the picosecond IRF at room temperature, but
complex streaking and detection optoelectronics are required. Using PCSC-FLIM, a recent study on Alzheimer
mouse brain tissue has found a new 30-ps lifetime component, critical for separating Alzheimer disease from
normal brain tissue, of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NADH). Without the 10-ps IRF of PCSC-FLIM,
such fast fluorescence decay could not have been observed within a reasonable amount of time. Similarly, a
short IRF will benefit the study of short-lived non-lipofuscin autofluorophores (30-70 ps) that will lead to a better
understanding of the fundus autofluorescence diagnosis and may provide relevant retina information for the early
detection of age-related macular degeneration and neurodegenerative diseases.
 This proposal will develop a potentially transformative FLIM system, photon-streaking FLIM (PS-FLIM), that
addresses the imaging speed challenge by simultaneously reducing the IRF and increasing the maximum photon
counting rate. A new concept of photon streaking, based on the principle of space-time duality, will be
implemented to achieve 5-ps IRF and 840 Mcps in a compact and lightweight platform. Two-photon excitation
will be utilized to increase the imaging depth and reduce the phototoxicity. Finally, machine learning framework
will be incorporated to accelerate the FLIM data analysis."
10758286,"Summary
Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles that play vital roles in a myriad of cellular functions, including energy
production, metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and cell death. It is generally accepted that a decline in
mitochondria quality is a key contributor to mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and represents a key point of
convergence for several neurological disorders. Yet, precisely how dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to
these conditions remains elusive. Mitochondria are thought to be constantly rejuvenated via collaborative
processes of mitogenesis, fission-fusion, and multi-level quality-control mechanisms. Accordingly, the average
half-life of mitochondrial proteins in the brain has been estimated at less than 3 weeks. Recently, I identified a
discrete number of mitochondrial long-lived proteins (mt-LLPs) that last at least four months in mouse brain and
heart. These long-lived mitochondrial proteins (mt-LLPs) include OxPhos complexes and several mitochondrial
cristae associated proteins, which similarly to other architecturally stable and long-lived structures (i.e. nuclear
pore complexes) are recognized for their highly defined and elaborate ultrastructure. Therefore, we hypothesized
that the exceptional longevity of mt-LLPs could play an essential role in the long-term stabilization of the
mitochondrial cristae in long-lived, post-mitotic cells.
The goal of this research proposal is to delineate the localization of mt-LLPs within mitochondria in neurons,
examine their temporal dynamics and integration with newly synthesized proteins, and investigate their potential
contribution to mitochondrial fitness and long-term cristae stability. In Aim 1, using a combination of pulse-chase
protein labeling methods, super-resolution fluorescent imaging and mass spectrometry I propose to (1) examine
the spatio-temporal dynamics of mt-LLPs in axonal and somato-dendritic domains of primary neurons. In Aim
2, we propose to extend our analysis to include mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by investigating the coordination
between mt-LLPs enrichment and mtDNA longevity neurons. In Aim 3, I will investigate the mechanism(s)
involved in persistence of mt-ELLPs in neurons using genetic manipulations targeting mitochondrial cristae
stability. Lastly, in Aim 4 we will begin the investigation into the coordination between nuclear and mitochondrial
genome expression in neurons. In summary, insights from the proposed experiments will significantly advance
our understanding of long-term of mitochondrial proteome homeostasis and genome integrity in neurons, which
could provide with new molecular targets for modulating the mitochondrial network dynamics in the processes
of neurodegeneration."
10758272,"The goal of this application is to continue the highly successful Vanderbilt - Stimulating Access to Research
in Residency; V-StARR) mentored training program for residents in Medicine or Pediatrics who possess both
the aptitude and passion for becoming a new generation of clinician-scientists. We will continue to focus on “late
bloomers”; typically, those residents who decide to pursue a career as a clinician-scientist after acceptance to a
standard clinical residency pathway. The primary goal is to provide a nurturing mentored environment for
Resident Investigators to perform highly rigorous research training to facilitate a successful transition to a
research-focused fellowship and subsequent appointment as tenure track faculty. The overarching goal is to
expand the pipeline of those achieving independence as clinician-scientists. Another core goal is to promote
diversity and inclusion in research training in a highly intentional way. Each Resident Investigator will develop
and complete a mentored research project in an area of focus consistent with the missions of NHLBI and will
also participate in selected workshops and courses and in our clinician-scientist development communities.
Investigation may be basic, translational, clinical, or population health. All of our R38 graduates have gone on to
pursue research-based careers and based on their success, and our deep applicant pool, we are expanding our
program to six training slots to support Resident Investigators for 1-2 years with a minimum of 80% protected
research time. Four of these slots will be funded by the R38 award and one slot each by the Departments of
Medicine and Pediatrics. There is a formal program selection process to identify the most competitive applicants.
Our proven success in recruitment to the program demonstrates our ability to attract a strong group of applicants.
The program will provide intense scientific mentorship and personalized career development. The Resident
Investigators will have access to a cadre of more than fifty carefully selected NIH-funded preceptors who have
successful track records of mentoring early career scholars. Each Resident Investigator will have a personalized
Scholarly Oversight Committee to assist them in achieving program goals, to evaluate resident progress, and to
develop, advise on, and track their career development plan. Evaluation of Resident Investigators includes
competency-based milestone assessments. There will be equally rigorous program assessments. Key outcomes
for the program include: Academic productivity (presentations, peer-review publications, grants); recruitment of
scholars from diverse backgrounds; entry of residents into research intensive fellowships; and success in
obtaining T32 positions and K38 grants. Long-term follow-up of all Resident Investigators will be performed using
Flight Tracker and through personal contact. The Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics are fully integrated
into the Vanderbilt School of Medicine and Medical Center, and both rank in the top 10 in NIH funding. There
exists a very strong relationship between the Departments and between the PIs. We have incorporated several
important changes into this successful program and believe that these will further strengthen the V-StARR."
10816398,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the US and worldwide,
and it remains
disease
incurable in part due to an incomplete understanding of its cellular mechanisms. Small airway
 (SAD) and emphysema are important pathological phenotypes of COPD. SAD is characterized by
excessive mucus production and reduced alveolar attachment in the small airways (<2mm in diameter). SAD
may also worsen emphysema, the progressive destruction of alveolar tissue. However, the mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis of small airway mucin overproduction and alveolar destruction are not well
understood. Importantly, mucin is produced by an epithelial progenitor, the club cell, which can differentiate into
alveolar type II cells for tissue repair. Here, we have discovered that overproduction of a polymeric gel-forming
mucin MUC5B may be linked to impaired alveolar regeneration by club cells in a murine COPD model. Therefore,
this proposal aims to test the central hypothesis that alveolar maintenance and repair by club cells in health
and COPD is dependent on MUC5B expression. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MUC5B
expression inhibits differentiation of club cells into ATII cells during homeostasis. I will employ organoid assays
to test steady state progenitor functions of MUC5B-expressing and non-expressing club cells from healthy mice
with tamoxifen-induced lineage tracing of club cells and fluorescent labeling of endogenous MUC5B. Further
studies will employ mice with genetic deficiency or transgenic overexpression of Muc5b. Specific Aim 2 will test
the hypothesis that overproduction of MUC5B inhibits alveolar repair in a mouse model of COPD. Mice from Aim
1 will be treated with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) to test whether excessive MUC5B in club cells impairs
alveolar differentiation in vitro and in vivo, and whether conditional depletion of Muc5b ameliorates SAD and
emphysema. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that disrupting stimulated mucin overproduction
prevents SAD and emphysema by restoring progenitor function of club cells. I will investigate the mechanism of
how extra- versus intra-cellular excessive MUC5B impairs progenitor functions of club cells, and I will identify
novel genes that regulate club cell mucous and progenitor functions and expand on translational studies in
human COPD. These studies will fill gaps in our knowledge of heterogeneous functions of club cells in small
airways in homeostasis and disease. Aim 1, 2 and part of Aim 3 will be completed during the K99 training phase.
Key elements of my training will be learning new fields of mucin biology and bioinformatics that will help me
develop my career as a translational COPD researcher. Results of my studies will supply a foundation for strong
lines of independent research on pathways regulating epithelial phenotypes in COPD and development of novel
therapeutics for SAD and emphysema in the R00 phase. With my outstanding mentoring team and an
exceptional training environment, I am ideally positioned to achieve the proposed scientific training and career

10772093,"ABSTRACT
Among the 800,000 individuals who sustain a stroke annually in the United States, up to 65% continue to experience mod-
erate-to-severe impairments in one hand six months or more, limiting their ability to perform daily tasks. These impairments,
often characterized by the limited functional wrist and finger extension (< 20º), prevent the use of the paretic hand in func-
tional tasks. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), commonly used to promote repeated use of the paretic hand in func-
tional tasks, shows modest and transient effects in this population. Several non-invasive approaches of neuromodulation
[e.g., repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation, or paired associative stim-
ulation] have also been applied to cortical motor areas, in either the same hemisphere as the stroke or contralaterally, to
augment the effects of FES-facilitated task-specific practice. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness
of these approaches. Thus, it is critical to examine alternative approaches to improving hand function and functional inde-
pendence in this more impaired population. Our long-term goal is to develop mechanistic and theory-driven rehabili-
tation interventions to improve hand function and functional independence in individuals with severe stroke. The
strength of the synaptic connections between corticospinal axons and spinal motor neurons—which is severely affected
after stroke—is essential to produce functionally relevant voluntary movements. Emerging evidence points to the potential
for the reorganization of residual corticospinal inputs on spinal motor neuron pools to support recovery after stroke. Paired
corticospinal-motor neuronal stimulation (PCMS) has been shown to strengthen the synapse between surviving corticospi-
nal axons and spinal motor neurons. In PCMS, TMS is paired with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) such that the TMS-
evoked corticospinal volleys arrive at corticospinal-motor neuronal synapses ~1-2 ms before the antidromic activation of
spinal motor neurons via PNS. Previous research in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury indicates that PCMS
delivered during voluntary contraction elicits greater gains in corticospinal transmission (i.e., the size of motor evoked
potentials [MEPs]) than at rest. These improvements in corticospinal transmission were also associated with improvements
in hand function, indicating that voluntary contraction during PCMS strengthens residual synaptic connections and enhances
motor performance. However, the behavioral effects of PCMS after moderate-to-severe stroke, particularly when combined
with a functional task, are not known. Therefore, a critical step in understanding the potential of PCMS in stroke reha-
bilitation is to employ PCMS during a functional task to augment task-specific practice in more impaired individuals
after stroke. Thus, our central hypothesis is that delivering PCMS during functionally relevant voluntary movements
(or task-specific PCMS) will improve corticospinal transmission and hand function after moderate-to-severe stroke.
To this end, using a within-subjects repeated measures design, we will test each participant on three conditions (task-specific
PCMS, task-specific sham-PCMS, and PCMS-rest) in a randomized order. The proposed proof of concept study will eval-
uate the short-term neurophysiological and behavioral effects of task-specific PCMS after moderate-to-severe stroke."

Prognosis is poor for patients diagnosed with locally advanced melanoma. Survival outcomes are improved
with checkpoint blockade in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and unresectable setting. Dual checkpoint blockade
further enhances outcomes, but often at the cost of significant clinical toxicity. Despite this progress, for the
more than 40% of patients who do not respond, outcomes remain dismal. There is a clear need to develop
innovative treatment approaches with higher response rates and less toxicity. Radiation (RT) has immuno-
stimulatory activity capable of inducing an anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response within and outside of the irradiated
field - an abscopal effect. In preclinical and clinical studies, RT’s immuno-stimulatory activity synergizes with
checkpoint blockade (αPD-1) to significantly improve tumor control with limited toxicity. Despite the
encouraging clinical potential of RT + αPD-1, the abscopal effect still only occurs in a minority of patients. To
determine innovative methods to enhance the abscopal effect, we evaluated tumor-directed RT’s impact on
different CD8+ T-cell subsets in a murine model. The Ahmed lab has shown an exhausted PD-1+ T cell subset,
stem-like CD8+ TCF-1+ T cells, are essential for robust αPD-1 responses. Dendritic cell (DC) provided peptide-
MHC and co-stimulation along with αPD-1 stimulate stem-like T cell expansion and differentiation into terminal
effector cells capable of tumor killing. I have shown this stem-like subset is primarily localized to the tumor-
draining lymph node (TDLN). Strikingly, tumor-directed RT alone stimulates maturation of DCs and proliferation
of this subset in the TDLN. This proliferative response following RT, independent of αPD-1, suggests a novel
RT induced mechanism for T-cell reinvigoration which may be exclusively DC dependent. Notably, for locally
advanced or high-risk melanoma patients, immunostimulatory therapy (RT and/or αPD-1) are typically given
following tumor and TDLN removal. This current approach reduces the immuno-stimulatory potential of either
treatment compared to their administration with an intact TDLN. Importantly, combination pre-operative αPD-1
and RT have not been investigated in locally advanced or high-risk melanoma. Based on these preliminary
results, our central hypothesis is that the stem-like CD8+ T cells in the TDLN are important mediators of the Tumor-
RT stimulated anti-tumor abscopal effect. To test this hypothesis, we will: (1) determine the role of the stem-like
CD8+ T cells in the abscopal effect; (2) determine whether dendritic cell mediated stimulation is critical for RT
induced stem-like T cell expansion in the TDLN; (3) determine whether neoadjuvant Tumor-RT with αPD-1 is
associated with increased stem-like CD8+ T cell infiltration in locally advanced melanoma in a pilot human
study. Results of this proposal may identify a novel mechanism for overcoming T-cell exhaustion which has
less immunologic toxicity with increased anti-tumor efficacy. Clinically, it may redefine the standard approach
of surgical removal or irradiation of the TDLN due to the lymph node’s importance in the abscopal response."

CAG repeat expansion diseases are the most common class of microsatellite expansion disorders. While
canonical translation of the CAG repeat leads to the production of polyglutamine proteins, these expansions can
also undergo non-canonical repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. In the later process, translation is
initiated across multiple reading frames in the absence of AUG- or AUG-like start codons. While a few factors
that influence either canonical translation across microsatellite expansions or RAN translation have been
identified, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for translation in multiple
reading frames is extremely limited. Despite evidence that RNA structure plays a key role in RAN translation our
knowledge of the structural features that facilitate RAN translation is extremely limited. To examine the role of
RNA structure in non-canonical translation, I used a structure-forward approach to screen for multi-frame
translation, through which I identified several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that support translation in
multiple reading frames in the absence of both microsatellite repeat expansions and AUG-start codons. This
data suggests multiple avenues for RNA transcripts to support multi-frame translation, which has important
implications in biology, disease, and therapeutics. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the RNA
structures, protein networks and therapeutically relevant modifiers that govern various forms of multi-frame
translation (MFT). To determine the proportion of the human genome capable of undergoing MFT, I will utilize a
novel MFT reporter system to perform a genome-wide screen. Utilising candidate MFT sequences and CAG
repeat expansions along with my already identified MFT lncRNAs, I will determine the cellular RNA structures
and protein factors that facilitate non-canonical multi-frame translation. I will also employ a first-of-its-kind
strategy to identify novel, therapeutically relevant modifiers of co-occurring canonical and non-canonical
translation in multiple reading frames. These studies will enable a better understanding of the mechanism of
multi-frame translation and identify therapeutic strategies that have the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy
across multiple CAG repeat expansion diseases and be applicable to a wider range of neurological diseases.
Together this research provides an innovative approach to understand a novel paradigm for translation diversity
and will enable a better understanding of disease pathogenesis in repeat expansion diseases as well as
elucidating the aspects of MFT most suitable to therapeutic intervention."
10813706,"Our pathological examination of acquired neurological injury uncovered the rod microglia variant of activated immune cells in the brain. Over a century ago, similar rod microglia were hand drawn to indicate neuropathology in general paresis, typhoid, and chemical exposure, and then largely ignored. Following our 2012 publication, rod microglia have been visualized in post-mortem tissue with clinical and neuropathological confirmation of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), in addition to epilepsy, mental health disorders, and others. Yet no molecular tools exist for precise molecular investigation of rod microglia. As cellular mechanisms of ADRD and injury include neuroinflammation and concomitant microglia activation, a critical problem emerges from our inability to detect and analyze rod microglia within the context of ADRD/brain injury neuroinflammation. The body of knowledge on rod microglia relies solely on histological stains and non-specific microglia antibodies (e.g., Iba1, CD68, CX3CR1) for post-mortem microscopic identification. Our most recent single-cell RNAseq data from 100 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and control subjects identified a unique cluster of microglia defined by genes for motility, cytoskeletal actin dynamics, and movement of microglial processes; confirmation of this cluster as rod microglia cannot occur without new molecular tools to phenotype this elusive microglia variant.
For this Bioengineering Research Grant (PAR 19-158), collections of molecular tools and markers unique to the rod microglia variant will be developed, validated, and verified to enable future diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic studies of neuroinflammation progression in cases of ADRD and brain injury. To develop these tools, we propose a diffuse brain-injury model that generates fields of rod microglia adjacent to neuronal dendrites. From this tissue, we will capture (LCM) CX3CR1-eGFP rod microglia and non-rod microglia for phage display biopanning from a library of human-derived variable heavy-chain binding domain antibodies (dAB). Synthetic cyclized HCDR3 peptides will be developed as dAb mimetics unique to rod microglia (Objective 1). Spatial transcriptomics of the rod microglia variant using the nanoString GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler will determine differentially expressed genes between rod and non-rod microglia (Objective 2). Pathway analysis will identify cellular processes associated with the structure, function, motility, and origin of rod microglia. For each objective, new molecular tools are validated and verified across time post-injury, between sexes, and in experimental models of mixed pathology TBI, stroke, and AD (familial and late-onset amyloidosis), as well as post-mortem human AD/ADRD tissue. The new tools proposed in this application will be able to identify, isolate, and interrogate the rod microglia variant, while expanding the concept of neuroinflammation in aging, injury, and disease to include the overlooked rod microglia variant that presents adjacent to neuronal dendrites. With refined molecular tools, rod microglia can be investigated across many neurological conditions and incorporated into unifying principles that explain microglial activation and neuroinflammation.

 Despite acutely enhancing monoamine function, chronic administration of monoamine antidepressants
is required for clinical response, suggesting that adaptations downstream of enhanced monoaminergic signaling
are central to their therapeutic efficacy. One such downstream adaption is the epigenetic upregulation of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key protein in the neurotrophic process. This is in line with the neurotrophic
hypothesis of depression, which posits that insufficient neuronal growth contributes to the pathogenesis of MDD,
as evidenced by reduced hippocampal volume in the postmortem brains of depressed patients, and thus the
restoration of neurotrophy is central to the efficacy of antidepressants. In addition to requiring chronic treatment,
traditional antidepressants drugs are also ineffective in a significant proportion of depressed patients and
produce a wide variety of undesirable side effects. On the other hand, ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) antagonist and anesthetic, a single dosage of which has been shown to relieve symptoms in less than
an hour and for at least one week in patients who failed to response to at least two typical antidepressants.
Unlike traditional antidepressants, ketamine appears to promote BDNF-mediated neurotrophy rapidly and
directly but optimizing this anesthetic for antidepressant application and designing novel drugs its image requires
further elucidation of its targets and the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects. We hypothesize that
rather than rather than indirectly altering neurotrophic genes, as with chronic administration of typical
antidepressants, ketamine bypasses this prolonged process of transcriptional regulation and instead induces
RNA modifications that rapidly upregulates the translation of neurotrophic proteins. stress-induced changes in
levels of N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification, have been observed in MDD
patients and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the m6A demethylase, fat mass and obesity associated protein
(FTO), are associated with increased risk of MDD. Furthermore, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-
3), which ketamine does through NMDAR antagonism, increases FTO concentrations which promotes
conversion of the pro-apoptotic proBDNF to BDNF through demethylation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-
9). Taken together, these findings present a plausible epitranscriptomic mechanism for the rapid neurotrophic
and antidepressant effects of ketamine. Because m6A methylation varies between species, and the methylation
sites of relevant genes, such as MMP-9, differ between mice and humans, we will use human induced pluripotent
stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical glutamatergic neurons to delineate the effects of ketamine on the
epitranscriptome, m6A machinery, as well as neuronal structure and function. The successful completion of these
aims will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine thus
enabling the identification and optimization of novel antidepressants."
10819133,"Project Summary/Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a method of medical imaging that employs positron emitting
radionuclides attached to probe molecules (tracers) for non-invasively interrogating biological processes in vivo.
Each radionuclide decay emits a positron, which then combines with an electron and creates two oppositely
directed, colinear 511 keV annihilation photons. These annihilation photons are detected in opposing elements
of a photon detector ring forming lines of response (LOR) along which each positron emission originated. After
collecting millions of such photon pair events and positioning them along system LORs, an image can be
reconstructed to visualize and quantify the 3D distribution of tracer probe molecules within the body. Up to now,
PET systems detect only one tracer per study. However, more complete understanding of the disease biology
often requires the study of multiple biological processes simultaneously. Alzheimer’s Disease specifically is
characterized by presence of neuroinflammation, β-amyloid, phosphor-τ, and neurodegeneration. This project
aims to enable simultaneous imaging of multiple tracers by strategically choosing at least one PET tracer that
emits gamma photons in cascade with their positron. These gamma photons can be differentiated from
annihilation photons through their higher energy measured by the photon detector. Thus, LORs can be
associated with this positron + gamma tracer when a high energy photon arrives nearly the same time as a pair
of 511 keV photons.
Challenges associated with using prompt gamma emitters come from the lower probability of detecting both the
annihilation photons and gamma photon within the appropriate timing and energy windows. Another challenge
associated with using multiple tracers is misclassification of events among tracers due to missed, tissue
scattered, or random photons detected. Low detection efficiency and misclassification will reduce image quality
and accuracy of the associated multi-tracer images; thus, methods must be developed to mitigate these issues.
This project proposes to develop and characterize a position-sensitive endcap detector that will cover the open
end of an existing PET ring system to increase the detection efficiency for 3-photon events through increasing
the solid angle coverage of the system photon detectors. Signal processing algorithms will also be employed
using multiple temporal and energy windows to mitigate misclassification of photons coming from the two
emitters in addition to compensating for sensitivity differences between two- and three-photon emitters. These
techniques will include use of delayed time windows to estimate the different random coincidence rates and joint
maximum likelihood estimation of coincidence events based on system geometry. We will also use deep learning
to improve the image quality of the low dose images and to accurately separate the images obtained. Through
these techniques, this project aims to develop the first system capable of simultaneous multi-tracer PET imaging."

Methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are among the most frequently
occurring and dangerous antibiotic-resistant public health threat. Clinical resistance to all front-line MRSA
antibiotics (i.e. vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and ceftaroline) has been observed, further exacerbating
this threat and highlighting the urgent need for new strategies to overcome drug resistance in S. aureus. In
recent years, there has been increased interest in targeting signal transduction systems for development as
antimicrobials and anti-virulence agents. Targeting bacterial signal transduction is attractive because these
systems are essential for many cellular processes in prokaryotes, and signal transduction pathways have been
extensively studied in eukaryotic systems, as evidenced by the availability of chemical libraries containing
small molecule probes with kinase inhibitor-like properties. With this strategy in mind, we screened a focused
set of kinase inhibitors and identified tofacitinib, an antirheumatic Janus kinase inhibitor, as a potential
chemistry starting point for the discovery of beta-lactam potentiators against MRSA. Several pyrrolopyridin-4-
amine (P4A) analogs of tofacitinib were synthesized, which led to the discovery of potent analogs with the
ability to re-sensitize oxacillin (OXA; a beta-lactam antibiotic) against MRSA. Preliminary pull-down proteomic
experiments have identified PurM, SrrB, and PknB as putative targets, studies that have been complemented
by gene knockout experiments. Therefore, the main scientific objective of this proposal is to confirm P4A
engagement of putative targets using biophysical and biochemical techniques and to establish the
therapeutic potential of tofacitinib analogs as anti-virulence agents and OXA potentiators against
MRSA. In Aim 1, I will evaluate the binding of lead P4A compounds to putative targets, demonstrate inhibition
of S. aureus kinase activity and determine the extent of potential off-target effects on mammalian kinases.
Biophysical assays will be developed against the putative targets through a novel target engagement assay,
which will be complemented with biochemical phosphorylation and ATP/ADP conversion assays. In Aim 2, I
will evaluate the clinical potential of the P4A compounds through anti-biofilm studies, pharmacological ADME
profiling, and in vivo efficacy against MRSA in a mouse model. The research plan will enhance my training in
areas of target identification and validation, biophysical analysis, and anti-infective microbiology, benefiting

the Sigma 2/transmembrane protein 97 (σ2/TMEM97) receptor, that has been linked to pain only in the last five
years. The σ2/TMEM97 receptor is an endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane transmembrane protein
with known effects in cholesterol metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Recent behavioral pharmacology studies
investigated σ2/TMEM97 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pain and demonstrated that
σ2/TMEM97-selective ligands were able to reverse neuropathic injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in
mice. Neither the cellular mechanisms of this effect nor the anatomical location of the effects have been
identified. In fact, limited knowledge in the context of pain of the cellular properties of σ2/TMEM97 and
pharmacological properties of its ligands has been a barrier to accurately interpreting pharmacological behavioral
effects. To advance the previous studies on σ2/TMEM97 as a therapeutic target for pain treatment, I aim to
investigate the extent to which σ2/TMEM97 plays in the processing of nociception at the behavioral, cellular, and
molecular level. I will investigate the role of σ2/TMEM97 by utilizing transgenic animals to examine the difference
in cellular activity and the molecular profile of σ2/TMEM97-driven nociception in the peripheral nervous system
(PNS). The goal of this proposal is to 1) understand the cellular and molecular signature of σ2/TMEM97-
associated behavioral nociception in chronic inflammatory pain and 2) determine whether nociceptor-specific
loss of σ2/TMEM97 function results in behavioral changes associated with perturbation to the PNS. This project
includes significant training opportunities in molecular biology, animal behavior, and RNA sequencing data
analysis preparing the PI for an independent career in neuroscience and biomedicine."

Calcium in cardiomyocytes is released via an intracellular calcium channel, ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2). In
hearts where there are mutations in RyR2, spontaneous Ca2+ leakages can occur resulting in cardiac
arrhythmias. Small molecule therapeutics such as flecainide, tetracaine, and dantrolene have low specificity, low
membrane permeability, low solubility, poor selectivity, low potency, or toxicity. Therapeutic selectivity between
RyR isoforms (RyR1, RyR2, RyR3) is lacking, heightening our interest in developing ent-verticilide as an anti-
arrhythmic agent.
This proposal focuses on the discovery and development of new therapeutics as antiarrhythmic agents. The
proposed work is founded on our discovery of potent and selective inhibition of RyR2-mediated calcium flux by
ent-verticilide. Through a cross-disciplinary collaboration, it was discovered that ent-verticilide is a selective
inhibitor of RyR2-mediated calcium release, including a preliminary study of efficacy in vivo. As a 24 membered
cyclic depsipeptide with a molecular weight of 853 Da, ent-verticilide falls outside of the category of a traditional
small molecule drug. While “Beyond Rule of 5” compounds with in vivo activity are growing in number, an
understanding of their pharmacokinetics (PK) has lagged, thereby requiring new chemical tools and creative
tactics to advance the field. We will investigate the permeability of this unnatural product and its analogues by
development of a structure-activity relationship profile focused on both permeability and increased efficacy. We
aim to systematically design and synthesize structural analogues of ent-verticilide with varying degrees
of N-methylation. Following the synthesis, we will study passive permeability and collect structural data
to inform SAR, providing additional perspective for feedback to Specific Aim 1. By methodicalstructural
change to ent-verticilide, we will create an SAR-based feedback loop between permeability, activity, structure,
and conformation. A strength of this approach is the combination of rigorous tools to study passive membrane
permeability, and cardiomyocyte-based functional studies using both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells
to achieve an overall hypothesis-driven approach to discover how analogues of ent-verticilide travel through
cellular membranes and ultimately target RyR2. Another strength is our positioning to prepare diverse analogues
that include ring-chain variants likely to exhibit contrasting permeability. With increased understanding of the
mechanism of action, we hypothesize that we can design analogues of ent-verticilide with improved potency and
selectivity, thereby providing a potential therapeutic against fatal ventricular arrhythmias."

A critical gap in understanding the etiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identifying the upstream
factors that lead to the development of both Alzheimer’s pathology and related neural dysfunction. Vascular
disease is found in approximately 80% of patients with concomitant AD pathology and thus may be an
important contributor to the development of AD, however relationships between vascular health and the
emergence of AD pathophysiology has not yet been comprehensively investigated in cognitively normal
samples. While large vascular adverse events such as stroke are known to confer risk for developing vascular
dementia, growing evidence suggests that subtle vascular damage accrued through a lifetime of injury could
predispose neural structure and function to become more susceptible to AD-related pathophysiology. Critically,
chronic and subtle forms of vascular disease are more commonly found in Black and Hispanic populations with
reduced access to healthcare and could help explain the increased prevalence of AD in these populations.
The goal of this renewal project is to establish the role of cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction (CVID) in the
pathophysiology of preclinical AD and develop individualized imaging-based cerebrovascular profiles that
predict memory decline across racially and ethnically diverse populations. We will conduct follow-up
assessments in 100 nondemented older adults (over 60 years of age) in our current award (BEACoN Cohort:
R01AG053555), which includes amyloid-PET (florbetapir), serial high-resolution MRI and tau-PET (MK-6240),
our innovative digital cognitive biomarkers which assess pattern separation, and a full UDS-3
neuropsychological testing battery. We will complement this with targeted new recruitment (n = 100) to
increase the representation of Hispanic/Latino and Black participants in our cohort. We have built an
infrastructure to radically transform recruitment and retention in our study including innovative partnerships with
clinical research organizations with a demonstrable track record in minority recruitment. Given focus on subtle
vascular damage, we will exclude based on history of stroke or severe cardiovascular disease. Our aims are
(1) Assess the novel biomarker framework in which CVID predicts tau accumulation, which predicts structural
and functional deterioration of the medial temporal lobes (MTL), subsequently predicting decline in
hippocampal pattern separation. (2) Construct individualized brain imaging based CVID profiles that
differentially predict decline in hippocampal memory across racially and ethnically diverse populations. (3) Aim
3: Associate CVID profiles with modifiable lifestyle risk factors and structural and social determinants of health
that are differentially distributed across racial and ethnic groups. In summary, we will develop a novel
mechanistic framework for how CVID contributes to AD pathophysiology and memory/cognitive decline that
directly addresses racial and ethnic disparities in AD risk. Cerebrovascular profiles, and their associated
modifiable risk factors that confer the greatest risk of AD, will be identified as targets for future intervention."
10794953,"Metastasis is the most common cause of breast cancer mortality. Of the breast cancer subtypes, triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the deadliest due to its increased likelihood to metastasize. Tumor cell
extravasation is a critical step of metastasis and allows circulating tumor cells to exit the vasculature and seed
distant tissues. Clear understanding of the major regulators of tumor cell extravasation will provide insights into
the progression of TNBC metastasis.
 One potential regulator of TNBC cell extravasation is ACKR1. In many contexts, ACKR1 expression is
required in endothelial cells (EC) for leukocyte extravasation. Endothelial ACKR1 binds CXCL2, a promigratory
chemokine, and localizes it to EC junctions to guide neutrophils through leukocyte extravasation. CXCL2
expression in TNBC cells is also necessary for tumor cell extravasation from lung microvasculature and for tumor
metastasis. Our preliminary data show that ACKR1 is required in at least one stromal cell type for TNBC
metastasis from the primary tumor to the lung. These data suggest that endothelial ACKR1-CXCL2 interactions
may mediate tumor cell extravasation in TNBC metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that endothelial ACKR1
promotes TNBC cell extravasation by retaining CXCL2 at EC junctions, resulting in the increased
metastatic spread of TNBC.
 To address this hypothesis, we will examine the in vivo significance of endothelial ACKR1 expression
using our validated ACKR1 endothelial cell-specific knockout mouse model. We will test the requirement for
endothelial ACKR1 for metastasis of orthotopically implanted TNBC tumors to distant sites in the lung and for
extravasation of circulating tumor cells into lung tissue. We will determine which steps of extravasation require
ACKR1 by evaluating ACKR1-low and ACKR1-overexpressing ECs using an Ibidi flow co-culture system that
recapitulates the shear stress conditions of pulmonary microvasculature. We will examine whether these steps
are dependent on CXCL2 by introducing CXCL2-neutralizing antibodies to the Ibidi flow system and observing
their effects on each extravasation step.
 Our proposed studies will establish the role of endothelial ACKR1 in TNBC metastatic progression and
determine the specific steps of tumor cell extravasation in which endothelial ACKR1 and CXCL2 function.
Understanding these processes may guide development of ACKR1 as a prognostic marker for metastasis and
can provide mechanistic insight into candidate chemokine and chemokine receptor inhibitors under evaluation
for treatment of breast cancer."
10830939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As important signaling molecules, proteases precisely control a wide variety of physiological processes both in
health and in diseases, and thus represent one of the largest families of pharmaceutical targets. Despite decades
of intensive efforts, conventional drug discovery strategies have only achieved a limited success by targeting a
small fraction of all therapeutically relevant proteases. It is because small-molecule inhibitors are often lack of
specificity and/or appropriate pharmacokinetic properties required for effective and safe protease-based therapy.
In these aspects, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are emerging as attractive alternatives with significant
advantages such as high selectivity, long serum half-life, potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, and as
inducible prodrugs. Since the invention of hybridoma technology, tremendous progress has been made in mAb
discovery and engineering. However, routine discovery of protease-inhibiting mAbs is still a considerable
challenge in general, due to the incompatibility of human antibody paratope for enzyme inhibition, and lack of
functional high-throughput screening methods. My laboratory has been committed to the development of
streamlined methodologies that facilitate the generation of therapeutic mAbs as safe and effective protease
inhibitors. Over the past five years, we have made significant progress, and established a series of novel
technologies, including camelid-inspired convex paratope human antibody libraries, and inhibition-based rather
than binding-based selection/screening methods. Combining these enabling approaches, we discovered,
characterized, and optimized panels of potent and specific mAbs inhibiting numerous proteases of biomedical
importance. Furthermore, our protease inhibitory mAbs have shown significant therapeutic efficacy in mouse
models of cancers, neuropathic pains, obesity, and stroke. By overcoming longstanding challenges, these
achievements have opened the exciting opportunity. In the next five years, we will extend our powerful
technologies to many other well-documented proteases, of which therapeutic inhibitors are urgently needed.
Furthermore, we will develop additional technologies to achieve unique and therapy-desirable features: (1)
function-specific (substrate-dependent) inhibition, (2) broad-spectrum inhibition on a group of proteases, and (3)
epitope-specific inhibition by rational design. Overall, it has been estimated that proteases account for 5-10%
of all drug targets have been studied for pharmaceutical development. The completion of proposed research will
unambiguously advance therapeutic mAb developments targeting biomedically important proteases, e.g. against
the present danger, SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease) as a broad
neutralization approach without the unwanted antibody-dependent enhancement."
10838539,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Shared decision making (SDM) between providers, parents, and youth is posited to be one of the processes of
self-management for a chronic condition. Adequate conceptual models for involving youth in decision making
must attend to the youth-parent-provider triad, recognize that there are multiple ways for youth to be involved
in the process of decision making, and underscore that parent, provider, and youth decision making behaviors
and roles should change with development. The field lacks empirical research to understand the nature of
parent-youth-provider interactions about decisions and outcomes of different patterns of behavior over time,
including adherence and health outcomes in youth with a chronic illness. This lack of research is due, at least
in part, to the absence of feasible, reliable, valid, and conceptually sound measures that assess the complex
interplay of decision making behaviors during medical encounters. The primary objective of this proposal is to
develop a measure of youths’ involvement in decision making during outpatient visits for pediatric chronic
illness (specifically, type 1 diabetes, sickle cell disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel
disease). Aim 1 is to utilize semi-structured qualitative interviews with youth, parents, and providers (Study 1,
Phase 1) and cognitive interviews with youth and parents (Study 1, Phase 2) to develop items for a new
measure- the Decision Making Involvement Scale-Medical Encounters (DMIS-ME)- and ensure alignment
between participant interpretation and intent of the items. Aim 2 is to evaluate the psychometric properties and
validity of the DMIS-ME, utilizing both classical and modern test theory. Validity will be assessed by examining
whether DMIS-ME subscales are associated with youth age, decision self-efficacy, perceived global health,
self-management skills, and adherence. Secondary Aim 2 is to develop a typology of visit profile classes based
on DMIS-ME subscales, using latent class analysis, and examine whether the classes vary based on socio-
demographics and variables tested in Aim 2. For Aim 2 (Study 2), we will enroll and assess youth and their
parents, immediately after attending an outpatient specialty care visit related to their chronic illness. They will
complete the DMIS-ME and measures of decision self-efficacy, perceived global health, self-management
skills, and adherence. Aim 3 is to identify and describe ethnic/racial disparities in youths’ perceived
involvement in decision making based on data from Aim 1 and 2. The development of the DMIS-ME addresses
a critical gap in the field of pediatric self-management and decision making. The DMIS-ME can be used in
future research to describe youths’ decision making involvement in a multidimensional way that accounts for
the youth-parent-provider triad, identify outcomes of involvement, and inform the development and evaluation
of interventions to enhance youth involvement in decision making, and ultimately, health behaviors and
outcomes, as they mature."

 Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has demonstrated efficacy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder
(GAD), yet there remains a major knowledge gap about its neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies thus far
have mostly focused on the impact of MBSR on structural and resting-state brain changes, and these studies
have been predominantly conducted in healthy participants. Core features of GAD, such as ruminative worry,
represent dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that increase bias towards future threat. MBSR success is
associated with improved emotion regulation, enhanced attention to the present moment, and non-judgmental
acceptance of internal and external cues. Our primary aim is to elucidate neural mechanisms that drive response
to MBSR in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and to examine the degree to which sex differences
in MBSR response are explained by sex differences in these mechanisms. Our overarching hypothesis is that
MBSR enhances ‘top-down’ learning and memory capacities that are broad and impact ‘top-down’ as well as
‘instinctual’ abilities (bottom-up) to regulate fear and emotions. We will first study the functional activation of brain
regions associated with the fear extinction network (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and
amygdala) as a specific probe of the ‘instinctual’ type of emotion regulation. Second, we will use a novel analytic
approach to examine large-scale functional connectivity as a marker of neural plasticity changes (pre- and post-
MBSR) trial-by-trial during fear extinction learning across the entire brain, focusing analyses on the default mode
network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and ventral attention network (VAN). Next, we will examine sex
differences in MBSR-induced neural changes and their relationship to sex differences in clinical GAD response.
Finally, we will use a novel statistical approach to explore whether baseline neural measures can predict MBSR-
induced neural changes and clinical symptom reduction to identify likely MBSR responders. Participants will
undergo a standardized 2-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in the fMRI scanner before and after
MBSR or stress education (SE) with primary clinical outcomes at endpoint and 3 month follow-up. This study’s
objectives are aligned with NCCIH’s PA-18-323: Fundamental Science Research on Mind and Body Approaches
by studying MBSR’s neural mechanism of action and sex differences in patients with generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD), a prevalent condition often seen in primary care for whom MBSR efficacy is established. This study will
deploy rigorous scientific methods with a time and attention control intervention to enable isolation of MBSR’s
mechanistic impact on brain regions involved in emotion regulation and clinical response. The unique
combination of a focus on a classic anxiety condition with established emotion regulation difficulties implicating
target neural circuits, previously demonstrated MBSR efficacy, and sex differences with rigorous fMRI behavioral
probes with novel analytic approaches ought to provide major new insights about MBSR mechanisms and sex
considerations, moving towards precision medicine that could guide future treatment development research."

Sex differences in daily sleep amount, sleep fragmentation, and basal slow wave activity (SWA) are largely
driven by gonadal hormones. However, sex differences in the mid-active phase sleep amount and the ability to
recover from sleep loss are largely insensitive to gonadal hormones, and are regulated in part by sex
chromosomes. Preliminary data in this application show that a key determinant of sex differences in active
phase sleep amount is the presence or absence of the Sry gene of the Y chromosome, which encodes the
testis-determining factor. This study will use two mouse lines with altered sex chromosomes to elucidate the
origin of sex differences in sleep and in order to determine the respective roles of Sry gene and chromosome
complement on sleep regulatory mechanisms. The first specific aim will test the hypothesis that Sry gene
establishes sex differences in sleep homeostasis during development by observing sleep-wake patterns in the
EMG of neonatal, prepubertal mice, and EEG/EMG of adult mice with altered sex chromosomes and
hormones. The second specific aim will test the hypothesis that X chromosome dosage drives sex differences
in the ability to recover from sleep loss. During each of these studies, active-phase sleep amount in mice will
be used as a biomarker for sleep homeostasis. These experiments are important and required to understand
the role of the sleep homeostat in regulating sleep and how it is established. They are the first comprehensive
analysis of sex differences in a juvenile mammalian species and the first to examine the specific effects of
either X or Y chromosome dosage on sleep. The overarching goal of these experiments is to identify the
specific mechanisms through which sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes are able to regulate sleep. These
studies will uncover the origins of sex differences in the homeostatic ability to recover from sleep loss. These
findings will likely lead to improved therapies for sleep disorders that exhibit sex differences in incidence and
severity, particularly those more prevalent in women."
10833648,"Drug-associated conditioned stimuli (CS), or cues, contribute to both the progression and persistence
of addiction. We hypothesize, as have others, that blocking reconsolidation of cocaine-cue memories could
prevent cue-induced relapse. Reconsolidation is a process whereby reactivation of a memory renders it labile
and vulnerable to disruption. Our published data, and that of others, confirm that limbic-striatal dopamine (DA)-
dependent and several plasticity-regulated signaling mechanisms are involved in cocaine-cue reconsolidation
processes. In this new proposal we hypothesize that violation of cocaine-cue expectancy renders a memory
labile by triggering memory destabilization, thereby making cocaine-cue memories more sensitive to
subsequent disruption by amnestic agents. The ability to induce the destabilization of cocaine-cue memories
may be a key factor in enabling the use of targeted pharmacotherapies to block cocaine-cue memory
reconsolidation and treat maladaptive memories. We propose to investigate directly the role of expectancy in
reconsolidation of cocaine-cue memories and their impact on subsequent relapse-like behaviors by varying the
difference between what is expected and experienced during reactivation and by photo stimulation of midbrain
DA-containing VTA neurons to neutralize or induce prediction error (PE)-like signals.
 In Aim 1 we will reactivate cocaine memories by violating expectations of a) US (i.e., cocaine)
magnitude and b) CS-US temporal contiguity. These manipulations should generate PE-like signals at the time
of memory retrieval. According to our hypothesis and preliminary data, both positive and negative PE-like
signals should induce destabilization and make the cue memory susceptible to blockade (i.e., reconsolidation)
by an amnestic agent to reduce subsequent relapse to drug-seeking behavior. Relapse-like behaviors will
include cue-induced and drug-primed reinstatement, and other measures, in male and female rats subjected to
weeks of long-access cocaine self-administration. Select agents that potently and selectively alter memory
reconsolidation processes – the protein-synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI) and the histone acetyltransferase
(HAT) inhibitor garcinol – will be used to render the destabilized memory subject to amnestic blockade.
 In Aim 2 we will optogenetic-based photostimulation of midbrain VTA DA neurons (TH-Cre+ rats)
during cocaine-cue memory reactivation a) to artificially produce a dip or b) a spike in DA signaling, to
artificially act as a negative or positive PE-like signal, respectively, to destabilize the cue memory and render it
susceptible to amnestic blockade, ultimately reducing measures of cocaine relapse-like behaviors.
 Together these studies will define novel behavioral conditions whereby destabilization mechanisms can
be used to make memories more susceptible to amnestic agents, to block reconsolidation of cocaine-cue
memories, to reduce relapse-like behaviors, and to inspire the development of innovative therapeutic strategies
for maladaptive memories."
10821357,"Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is a soft tissue sarcoma, with one of the worst prognosis. We will
build on our discovery that UPS contains a small subpopulation of metastasis initiating cells (MCs) that are
enhanced for their ability to form metastasis. Our proof of principle data showed that targeting genes
differentially expressed in the MC population inhibits metastasis in UPS tumors established as xenografts in
mice. In our preliminary data, we show that epigenetic changes distinguish the MC from the rest of the UPS
cell populations. Furthermore, we found that individual cell populations in UPS produce secreted factors that
influence behavior of other cell UPS cell populations, acting in a competitive manner. Our hypothesis is that
the MC population is maintained by epigenetic changes that endow this subpopulation of cells with distinct
properties that drive sarcoma metastasis. We will test this hypothesis by answering the following two
questions:
 1) What drives the MC population? Here we will build on our preliminary data suggesting that
epigenetic events driven by the regulation of histone acetylation and methylation maintain the MC. The function
of differentially expressed genes in the MC in regulating metastatic ability will be assessed using a lung organ
on a chip assay and findings will be tested in-vivo in murine tumors.
 2) Can pharmacologically targeting the MIC population be used to treat UPS? Here we will build
on our gene expression data, CRISPER screens, and results from a high throughput drug screen to identify
agents that target the MC. Pharmacologic agents and genetic approaches in murine tumors and human
primary UPS tumors established as xenografts in immunodeficient mice to determine their effect on disease
progression and metastasis.
This proposed work utilizes unique mouse models of sarcoma and human tumors to test novel biologic
processes related to cellular heterogeneity in sarcoma. As such, it will provide important biologic insights not
only about UPS, but also about cell heterogeneity in cancer in general. In addition, it will lead to the
development of new treatment approaches for UPS, a tumor with a poor outcome using currently available
therapies."

 The International Consortium on Brain and Behavior Copy Number Variants (IBBC-CNVs) is a collaborative
effort of 9 institutions with complementary experience and expertise in phenomics and genomics. The 22q11.2
and 16p11.2 loci are associated with significant risk for neuropsychiatric disorders across the lifespan. The
clinical presentations are heterogeneous, manifesting in a range of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum, and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders. Taking
a `genetics first' approach of ascertaining patients based on known, homogeneous genetic etiologies will allow
us to overcome barriers posed by the genetic and phenotypic complexity of idiopathic developmental
neuropsychiatric disorders. We postulate that CNVs exert a large main effect on psychopathology, but the
nature and degree of psychopathology observed in CNV carriers is multifactorial, with contributions from
additional rare and common genetic variants, as well as environmental factors. Therefore, dissecting the
effects of major CNV hits as well as additional rare and common variants on dimensional measures of
psychopathology can elucidate the combined contribution of genetic mechanisms to psychiatric conditions and
build models of risk prediction. Notably, the presentation and course of psychopathology in the CNVs resemble
these features in idiopathic disorders. Therefore, beyond the specific genetic syndromes investigated, such a
cross-CNV effort will identify convergent risk mechanisms for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders that
are of relevance to the broader population.
 We propose to dissect dimensional measures of psychosis, social-emotional processing and
neurocognition, and their genetic and environmental modifiers, to elucidate the architecture of risk for
neuropsychiatric disorders in CNV carriers. Prospective evaluation with dimensional measures relevant to
neuropsychiatric disorders will be applied to a cohort of 2000 individuals with 22q11.2 and 16p11.2 deletions
and duplications (500 per group) and their relatives as feasible. In addition, categorical psychiatric diagnoses
will be assessed in CNV carriers. Recruitment for prospective phenotyping will leverage existing large cohorts
that carry these reciprocal CNVs, many of whom have already been ascertained and characterized with a
range of phenotypic measures. New whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be performed in CNV carriers that
have not yet been sequenced. We will also utilize existing genetic data from the largest available case-control
samples diagnosed with SZ, ASD, and ADHD in the PGC. Finally, analysis of common variants for a subset of
family members will allow us to complement our primary analysis by exploring models of complex genetic
inheritance in extended pedigrees that carry CNVs. Our ability to conceive such a large scale study capitalizes
on our existing successful collaborations, complementary expertise, and institutional commitments to achieve
these goals."

Endothelial dysfunction resulting from chronic inflammation and elevated circulating cholesterol promotes the
formation of plaques in the sub-endothelium of major arteries causing coronary heart disease—a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Repair of the injured endothelium holds great promise to treat
heart disease; however, endogenous endothelial cell (EC) regeneration is an inefficient process. The ability to
restore patency of the arterial endothelium would provide a significant therapeutic advancement. Because
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) constitute the majority of cells in the arterial wall and are capable of
phenotypic plasticity in response to pathophysiological stimuli, these cells represent an appealing source of
functional endothelial cells. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that govern trans-
differentiation of VSMCs into ECs to mend the injured endothelium would establish a novel treatment paradigm
for coronary heart disease. Our long-term goal is to discover new molecules and signaling pathways that
facilitate VSMC-to-endothelial transition (MEndoT). Our laboratory has identified and characterized a family of
evolutionarily-conserved endocytic adaptor proteins called epsins, which have crucial roles in coordinating
endocytosis and signal transduction. Our studies show that loss of epsins 1 and 2 in ECs and myeloid cells
reduces vascular inflammation and prevents plaque initiation and progression. To further assess the
therapeutic effects of targeting epsins in cells that drive lesion progression as well as plaque composition and
stability, we will use recently created disease-specific mice harboring VSMC-specific deficiency of these
epsins. We propose to interrogate the function of VSMC epsin proteins in these processes and establish that
therapeutic targeting of these proteins will promote beneficial VSMC phenotype switching. So far, our
preliminary studies indicate that ApoE-/- mice with a deficiency in VSMC epsins have a significant reduction in
plaque size, enhanced plaque stability (including an increase in fibrous cap area and ACTA2+ cells within the
cap), a reduction in the number of infiltrating cells (CD45+ immune and inflammatory cells and CD68+ foam
cells), and a prominent decrease in vascular stiffness and calcification. In addition, RNA-seq analyses show
that Klf4, the pluripotent transcriptional factor controlling phenotypic switching of VSMCs, is downregulated by
epsin loss, as is oxLDL-triggered Runx2 ubiquitination and degradation. In light of these findings, we will
investigate the following Specific Aims using unique mutant mice, in vitro models, and novel reagents: 1) To
determine the molecular mechanisms by which epsins regulate phenotype switching and mesenchymal-to-
endothelial differentiation, 2) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which epsins regulate VSMC
osteogenesis and promote arterial stiffness, and 3) To determine the therapeutic potential of targeting epsins
for atheroma formation and resolution. If fruitful, the proposed study will complement our prior work and
strengthen the concept that epsin proteins may serve as a potent therapeutic target for coronary heart disease."

MYC oncoproteins including c-Myc and MYCN are major drivers of human tumorigenesis. Expression of MYC
is deregulated and enhanced in many types of human cancer. For instance, MYCN is a major driver of
childhood cancers. While upregulated MYC expression induces tumor development in many tissues, depletion
of MYC abolishes tumorigenesis and results in tumor regression in various tumor models. Despite significant
progress in understanding the link between MYC upregulation and tumorigenesis, many key questions remain
regarding how upregulated expression of MYC leads to tumorigenesis. The relationship between MYC
upregulation and its transforming activity has not been investigated in a quantitative manner, which is important
because one potential consequence of elevated expression is protein phase separation that occurs when
protein concentration is above critical concentration. Recently, many transcription factors that contain
intrinsically disordered region (IDR) have been reported to undergo concentration-dependent liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS), forming biomolecular condensates (also known as membraneless compartments,
liquid droplets). MYC oncoproteins are transcription factors and contain IDR and our preliminary study reveals
punctate structures of MYCN in the nucleus of Kelly MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that
MYCN forms condensates in the Kelly cells where MYCN is highly expressed. Functions of biological phase-
separated condensates include compartmentalized signaling. Condensates of transcriptional factors have been
proposed to compartmentalize transcriptional machineries and remodel gene transcription. MYC oncogenic
signaling relies on its interaction with the key proteins including MAX and TRRAP for the transcriptional activity
and transforming, and inhibition of these interactions results in MYC inactivation. To understand upregulated
MYC oncoproteins and their link to tumorigenesis, several basic molecular biological questions need to be
addressed regarding biophysical/chemical mechanisms and functional roles of MYC condensates, including: 1)
Whether and how MYC undergoes phase separation and forms condensates in biochemical and cellular
systems; 2) Whether MYC condensates compartmentalize transcriptional machineries; 3) Whether MYC phase
separation remodels downstream gene expression and whether condensates of MYC is necessary for the
transforming activity. Because LLPS is dependent on protein concentration, biological functions of phase
separation are often entangled with effects from changes of expression levels. To dissect MYC LLPS and
functional consequences, there is a need for chemogenetic tools that can manipulate MYC LLPS without
changing protein levels, and ideally such manipulation can be performed in two opposite directions: driving
condensate formation and dissolving existing condensates. Here we propose to develop such chemogenetic
tools and combine them with fluorescent protein labeling technology and multicolor fluorescence imaging to
dissect biochemical mechanisms and functional roles of MYCN condensates."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In advancing innovative ways to address complex cancer challenges, there is a growing trend to bring together
scientists with knowledge and perspectives from different disciplines. The emphasis on developing relationships
across scientific disciplines and adopting collaborative interdisciplinary approaches to scientific discovery has
been recognized and shown to lead to significant advances in our fundamental understanding of cancer and its
clinical management. In addition, it is abundantly clear that such advances rarely occur in isolation but typically
represent team-based research endeavors. We believe that early exposure of trainees to interdisciplinary
education and training coupled with team-based learning and research environments will better position them
for successful careers in any area of cancer research. At present, there are no existing NCI-funded T32 programs
devoted to team-based training. This concept is emphasized in our proposed Team-based Interdisciplinary
Cancer Research Training (TICaRT) Program. The Program is based on four premises: 1) interdisciplinary
training in team science will be critical in preparing future generations of cancer scientists; 2) team-based
research translates into an improved training environment by providing trainees with access to scientists in
different disciplines; 3) Florida needs a continuous supply of highly-trained cancer researchers including women,
underrepresented minorities and individuals with disabilities; and 4) program graduates must have the skills to
translate their knowledge and experience to achieve successful cancer research careers in academic, industry,
or government positions. Our goal is to develop a cadre of outstanding independent investigators in a training
program that encompasses cancer research across disciplines and unites laboratories, trainees, and mentors in
areas, including dentistry, engineering, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, veterinary medicine, and
communication. The TICaRT program capitalizes on our existing strengths at the University of Florida, including
a core of well-established and productive investigators, outstanding research facilities, an exemplary record of
collaboration, excellent institutional commitment, and a culture of successful mentorship of graduate students,
post-doctoral fellows and early stage faculty. We have assembled a cohesive group of 29 basic science and

10612030,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, among the most disabling of all psychiatric conditions, place a significant
burden on the individuals who experience them, as well as their family members and society. Up to 35% of
individuals with the disorders do not demonstrate an adequate response to antipsychotic treatment, and remain
refractory to first-line therapies, which contributes to the burden and morbidity of the illness, often leaving patients
unable to integrate with their communities. A limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying
successful or unsuccessful antipsychotic treatment continues to hinder novel therapeutic development and
optimization of our existing therapies for these disorders. While recent work has demonstrated the utility of
functional and spectroscopic MR to elucidate the mechanisms underlying antipsychotic treatment, a more
comprehensive understanding of molecular and neuronal changes associated with treatment efficacy is lacking.
In this study, we address this knowledge gap by utilizing a multidimensional strategy with high-field, 7-Tesla
neuroimaging to deconstruct the mechanism underlying antipsychotic response in a cohort of individuals with
early schizophrenia. This project focuses on the cortical-basal ganglia system with several innovative
approaches, including assays of (1) the dopamine system via neuromelanin-sensitive MRI; (2) magnetic
resonance spectroscopic imaging of cortical γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate functioning; and (3) both
hypothesis and data-driven multivariate approaches to cortico-basal ganglia functional connectivity. Acutely
psychotic patients with early schizophrenia spectrum illness will be examined in this naturalistic and prospective
study. They will undergo scanning during treatment initiation, clinical assessments at 2-week intervals, and will
be rescanned after 8 weeks of treatment. A group of healthy controls will also be examined to establish normal
ranges of our neuroimaging measures. Results of this work will provide a more comprehensive foundation for
our understanding of antipsychotic treatment-related neurobiology, which will facilitate biomarker development,
mechanistic clinical trials, and the development of next-generation therapeutic strategies."

How do disasters affect health decision-making? Do disaster impacts operate, at least in part, through changes
in economic preferences and psychological factors? Can public health programs help shield communities from
the impacts of disasters? We pursue these questions by studying a major disaster that struck in the midst of a
randomized evaluation we are conducting of a community-level public health program in Mozambique. Prior to
the disaster, in 2017-2018, this study team had administered a baseline survey of approximately 4,500
households, and had facilitated random assignment of the program, Força à Comunidade e Crianças (FCC,
“Strengthening Communities and Children”). Out of 76 communities, half were assigned to the treatment
group, receiving the FCC program; the remainder serve as the control group. In March 2019, Cyclone Idai, the
most destructive cyclone ever recorded in Africa, struck our study areas. The FCC program implements an
interrelated set of health, educational, and economic interventions. Households are connected to community
support networks, encouraged to visit and use local public health clinics, provided with information to improve
health decision-making, and participate in microfinance programs. We first estimate human and economic
losses, as well as impacts on risky sexual behaviors (including transactional sex), sexually transmitted infection
(STI) testing, STI incidence, and COVID-19-related outcomes. We estimate impacts in a survey sample
determined prior to the disaster, and are thus able to deal with selection biases (e.g., differential sample
inclusion based on disaster exposure) that otherwise compromise treatment effect estimates. Impact estimates
will exploit heterogeneity in hurricane exposure across study communities. Then, we will study impacts on
individual preferences and psychological factors that may mediate the effects of disasters on health decision-
making. Examining motivated belief biases (in this context, over-optimism maintained by health risk denial) is
particularly novel; it is a new behavioral economics frontier but has not been empirically evaluated in health-
related contexts. Our measurement tools are piloted, refined, and ready for large-scale implementation. Finally,
we will assess whether the FCC program helps shield communities from the negative impacts of disaster
exposure on risky sexual behaviors; STI testing, prevalence, and treatment; and on COVID-19-related
outcomes. Causal inference will rely on the pre-disaster random assignment of the FCC program. We will also
examine mechanisms through which the program achieves its protective effects. This project's findings can
help guide the design of public health programs in the future. Insights into the economics and psychology of
post-disaster decision-making can suggest novel interventions to mitigate disaster-induced deterioration of
health decisions. Evidence on whether and how public health programs shield people from disasters can
provide guidance on their optimal design."
10860930,"Atherothrombosis, resulting from rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, is the leading cause of
death worldwide. However, the mechanisms that regulate the stability of late stage atherosclerotic lesions remain
poorly understood. Recent studies from our lab showed that smooth muscle cell (SMC) conditional knockout of the
platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PdgfrbSMC-Δ/Δ) in ApoE-/- mice was associated with nearly complete failure
of SMC to invest into lesions or the fibrous cap. However, surprisingly we observed no changes in lesion size or
indices of plaque stability, including the thickness of the Acta2+ fibrous cap, following 18 weeks of Western diet (WD)
feeding. Further investigation provided novel insights regarding the mechanisms underlying these changes. Key
findings included: 1) contrary to long-standing dogma that Acta2+ fibrous cap cells are derived almost exclusively
from SMC, we showed that they account for only 60-70% of Acta2+ cells in advanced ApoE-/- brachiocephalic (BCA)
or human coronary artery lesions with the remainder coming from endothelial cell-to-mesenchymal-to-myofibroblast
transitions (EndoMT-MFT, 20-25%) and macrophage-to-myofibroblast transitions (MMFT), 10-15%) respectively; 2)
loss of SMC investment into lesions with SMC PDGFRB KO was associated with large adaptive increases in
EndoMT-MFT and MMFT; 3) increased EndoMT-MFT, and MMFT did not sustain indices of stability when WD
feeding was extended to 26 weeks suggesting there may be qualitative differences in Acta2+ fibrous cap cells
depending on their origin; 4) RNA-seq analysis on the BCA of 18-week WD-fed PdgfrbSMC-Δ/Δ ApoE-/- mice versus
control littermate mice showed that energy metabolism pathways were the top ten upregulated pathways suggesting
that metabolic reprogramming may be required for SMC-MF, EndoMT-MF, and MMF transitions; and 5) inhibition of
aerobic glycolysis in cultured SMC prevented their transition to a MF state following treatment with PDGF and TGFβ.
Studies in this proposal will test the hypothesis that SMC, EC, and macrophage adaptive responses for maintaining
plaque stability require major shifts in energy metabolism and that the metabolic state of these cells can be
manipulated to stimulate beneficial changes in the phenotype of lesion cells and overall increases in plaque stability.
Aim 1 will determine if genetic knockout or pharmacologic inhibition of aerobic glycolysis in SMC and EC lineage
tracing ApoE-/- mice with advanced atherosclerosis is associated with evidence of reduced plaque stability. Aim 2 will
determine if genetic or pharmacologic promotion of aerobic glycolysis in SMC and EC lineage tracing ApoE-/- lineage
tracing mice with advanced atherosclerosis is associated with increased plaque stability. Studies for both aims will
include human validation studies using scRNAseq and histological data from stable asymptomatic versus unstable
symptomatic carotid endarterectomy samples. All studies will assess sex-dependent determinants of late-stage lesion
pathogenesis. Taken together, the proposed studies will provide novel insights regarding mechanisms by which
metabolic reprogramming of cells contribute to the cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of the fibrous
cap and may lead to development of novel pharmacological and dietary approaches for enhancing plaque stability."
10877893,"ABSTRACT
The current standard for treatment of regional breast tumors involves surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
While effective at reducing or even eliminating the primary tumor burden, chemotherapy can paradoxically
promote cancer dissemination and metastasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that link
chemotherapeutic treatment to metastasis in breast cancer is paramount to developing more effective
treatments and a durable response. Exposure to genotoxic stress, as elicited upon chemotherapy or
radiotherapy, can result in the engagement of a senescence program in both tumor cells and non-transformed
neighboring cells. The presence of senescent cells has recently been shown to promote aggressive traits in
cancer tumor models, including increased proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis and activation of the epithelial-
to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. EMT confers migratory and invasive features to cancer cells, which
facilitate their mobilization out of primary tumor sites and into circulation, favoring the metastatic process. The
secretion by senescent cells of a specific set of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, collectively
referred to as the SASP, is believed to mediate the detrimental effects of senescence on tumor cells. The
overarching goal of this study is to leverage our understanding of the SASP to blunt the emergence of
aggressive tumors following genotoxic treatment. Specifically, we have identified the flagellin receptor TLR5 as
a potent regulator of senescence-driven IL-6 secretion in an siRNA screen. We independently confirmed these
results, and demonstrated that TLR5 depletion blunts senescence-induced expression of diverse SASP
factors. Overall, TLR5 represents an ideal potential therapeutic target to prevent the detrimental effects of the
SASP in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients. We propose here to determine the contribution of TLR5
signaling to genotoxic stress-induced SASP production in breast cancer cells (aim 1), and to test the
hypothesis that blocking the TLR5 signaling pathway prevents the emergence of aggressive phenotypes in
chemotherapy-treated breast cancer (aim 2). The long-term goal of this project is to uncover the therapeutic
potential of targeting TLR5 as an adjuvant strategy to prevent the resurgence of aggressive breast tumor cells
following chemotherapy treatment."

This application proposes data collection to augment the longitudinal Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) to
create a national data resource, the Great Smoky Mountains Study of Rural Aging (GSMS-RA), for the study
of early determinants of the aging experience in a rural context. This proposal builds on a study that is already
distinctive: community-representative design; repeated in-depth assessments across multiple developmental pe-
riods; high retention (82.5% interviewed at wave 12/age 30); longitudinal banked bloodspots available for assay-
ing; longitudinal geospatial coding; large high-risk American Indian subsample; embedded quasi-experiment of
income transfers; and multi-generational assessments. We propose to add a full assessment of participant's
health, health risks, and cognitive, social and economic functioning in their early 40s (aim 1). This aim involves
locating, recontacting, and assessing 80%+ of the GSMS participants with a 120-minute in-home assessment,
including collection of demographic and socioeconomic and attitudinal information, neurocognitive tasks, and
biomeasure collection. We also propose to evaluate everyday life and the rural context of adults in rural Appala-
chia (aim 2). This aim involves following participants for 6 months with 1) an Ecological Momentary Assessment
(EMA) protocol assessing within-subject variability in health, wellness, economic, and social functioning (every
other week; 26 times total), 2) actigraphy to assess physical activity and sleep (3-1 week observations), and 3)
geospatial movement using GPS monitoring to assess activity space. This in-depth individual information will be
coupled with community and neighborhood profiles assessed via Census data linkage to block groups/census
tracts, systematic social observations of neighborhoods, and participant/neighborhood surveys on collective ef-
ficacy (i.e., social cohesion and informal social control). We propose to harmonize data collected in this project
with key aging studies to facilitate urban/rural and Appalachia/national comparisons (aim 3). This aim involves
harmonizing measures of core constructs to maximize overlap with key aging studies, creating cross-walked
codebooks between GSMS and key studies and constructing multi-study model datasets. Finally, we propose to
create a comprehensive data-sharing program (aim 4). This program will maximize access and use of GSMS-
RA for a new audience of users, scientists, and potential collaborators. The project brings together longstanding
GSMS researchers (Copeland, Dodge, and Aberg) with new collaborators who have led large-scale data col-
lection projects in middle and later adulthood (Hotz and Cagney). The proposed project is methodologically
innovative in gathering high-quality data on everyday life via GPS monitoring and an EMA design coupled with
actigraphy and rural context profiles via a combination of Census and other administrative data, systematic social
observations, and participant/neighbor surveys. This proposal looks to develop a new resource that captures the
full arc of a life with intimate detail about living and aging in a rural context."

Pneumonia, caused by bacterial and/or viral etiology, is the leading cause of death in children worldwide.
Preceding viral illness, linked to influenza infection, is a primary risk factor associated with secondary bacterial
pneumonia. Influenza infection is an annual, seasonal cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world.
Severe influenza pneumonia is often exacerbated by bacterial infection resulting in poor patient outcomes even
in previously healthy individuals. Further, secondary bacterial pneumonia with Staphylococcus aureus is
increasing in prevalence and is now more common than Streptococcus pneumoniae, the previously
predominant pathogen. The lack of effective anti-viral therapeutics, immunomodulatory drugs, and increasing
antibiotic resistance, coupled with poor vaccine coverage and efficacy, results in a dire need for novel
therapeutic target identification. The focus of this application is upon understanding the influenza-induced
mechanisms of susceptibility to bacterial super-infection, the leading cause of death during seasonal and
pandemic outbreaks. During the previous funding periods, our laboratory has identified suppression of
bacterial-induced Type 17 immune responses by preceding influenza as a critical susceptibility mechanism.
We have published extensively in this area, elucidating aberrant host defense pathways in this context. In this
application, we will build upon our ongoing work with two highly novel Aims derived from the original focus. We
now provide preliminary data implicating a detrimental role for type III interferon (IFNλ) in super-infection
through inhibiting monocyte function and pattern recognition receptor expression. These data support the
hypothesis that influenza induced IFNλ directly inhibits monocyte antibacterial function via suppression of
SIGNR3/4, which is required for subsequent activation of Type 17 immunity and S. aureus clearance during
super-infection. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which IFNλ inhibits monocyte function during
influenza, S. aureus super-infection. In Aim 2, we will define the role of SIGNR3/4 in host defense against S.
aureus in the lung. The proposed studies will further our understanding of how influenza impairs subsequent
immunity against S. aureus (Aim 1) and how the immune response to influenza attenuate S. aureus clearance
in the lung (Aim 2). Our overriding goal is to understand the critical mechanism(s) of susceptibility to influenza,
S. aureus super-infection and identify novel treatment targets in a pre-clinical model of disease."
10834939,"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers robust vocational programming that have helped
countless Veterans obtain competitive employment; however, these services are not uniformly effective as
recent data suggests that only 35 to 43% of Veterans are competitively employed at time of discharge. For
those who become competitively employed, job tenure may be brief, which is often attenuated by
underemployment or poor person-job fit. Moreover, only 3.5% of Veterans experiencing vocational problems
engage in vocational services offered by the VHA. On average, it takes Veterans more than four years to utilize
vocational services. These Veterans are at high risk of acquiring multiple functional losses and developing
chronic disabilities as their vocational needs go unmet for years.
 Research suggests that intrinsic factors like lacking clear vocational goals, perceiving barriers to
employment, and negative beliefs about one’s ability to work contribute to low engagement, outcomes, and
tenure of some consumers of vocational rehabilitation services. Thus, the VA may be able to improve
vocational engagement, outcomes, and tenure of Veterans with psychiatric disorders by enhancing vocational
services with added interventions targeting unhelpful psychological factors. Career counseling and
development services have been shown to be effective in helping civilian populations clarify vocational goals
and identity, enhance vocational self-efficacy, and increase proactive vocational behaviors in the face of
obstacles. Additionally, career counseling and development services help facilitate greater “match” between a
person and their job, and person-job match is a key determinant of long-term career tenure among individual
with psychiatric disorders.
 The researchers of this project propose a three-aim study to develop a career counseling and
development intervention for Veterans with psychiatric disorders (CCD-V). The first aim will focus on the
design and development of the CCD-V intervention with veteran and provider input (n=16). The second aim will
pilot test the intervention in an open trial (n=10) to gather Veteran input on the initial intervention. The third and
final aim will consist of a feasibility pilot randomized controlled trial (n=50) to examine acceptability and
feasibility outcomes and to explore the impact of the CCD-V intervention in terms of functional improvement
and other vocational outcomes. The proposed CCD-V intervention will consist of approximately eight individual
sessions that will be offered concurrently with existing VHA vocational rehabilitation services, (e.g., transitional
work experience [TWE]).The final product of this study is to produce a manualized CCD-V intervention, and
corresponding fidelity monitoring checklist, to be tested later in a larger efficacy trial."
10828336,"Inflammation and fibrosis often co-occur and contribute to a remarkably broad variety of diseases of every
organ and tissue. The overall role of interleukin (IL)-33 in inflammation and fibrosis has already been
established, but the mechanisms of such regulation are not fully understood. Limited attention has been paid
to the IL-33 precursor—full-length IL-33 (FLIL33)—which is basally and inducibly expressed, resides mostly
in the cell nucleus, and is thought to regulate inflammatory responses, wound healing, and transcriptional
regulation independently of the mature IL-33 (MIL33) cytokine. The understudied FLIL33 requires more
attention, because it is both the immediate source of the MIL33 cytokine and an independently active factor.
These IL-33 forms become pathophysiologically engaged under stress, but IL-33-null mice have no noticeable
basal phenotype, suggesting that IL-33 depletion is a safe therapeutic approach. Our objective is to form the
basis for therapeutic manipulation of IL-33 in inflammatory fibrotic diseases through integrated understanding
of proteolytic maturation and extracellular release of MIL33, intracellular signaling and functioning of FLIL33,
and proteolytic stability of the FLIL33 protein pool. We amassed new data related to the molecular control of
IL-33 subcellular localization, functional maturation, and extracellular release through a previously unknown
region within the FLIL33 molecule, which spans substantially more of the N-terminus than the currently known
“sensor domain.” We hypothesize that this segment may be targeted to control IL-33 activation and
extracellular release. We also discovered that the intracellular function of FLIL33 is centered on Smad3
phosphorylation in a TGF-beta-independent fashion. We hypothesize that this process is mediated by the
adaptor-related protein complex 2 and that targeting this mechanism allows for abrogation of the functional
effects of intracellular FLIL33. We also recently reported that importin 5 (IPO5) protects FLIL33 from
proteolytic degradation, driving the hypothesis that IPO5-binding, cell-permeable decoy peptide(s) will induce
the loss of IPO5-mediated protection of FLIL33 from proteasomal degradation. This prospective therapy will
deplete the FLIL33 protein pool, thus exhausting the source of MIL33 and simultaneously attenuating the
intracellular effects ofFLIL33. The Specific Aims of this project are to: 1) Precisely map the segments in the
N-terminal region of FLIL33 that are responsible for its nuclear-versus-cytoplasmic localization, functional
maturation, extracellular release, and selective binding of intracellular molecular partners; 2) Define the
molecular mechanism responsible for FLIL33-induced, TGF-βligand-independent phosphorylation of Smad3;
and 3) Develop a cell-permeable decoy peptide-based approach to deplete intracellular FLIL33, thereby
exhausting the source of MIL33 and simultaneously attenuating the independent effects of FLIL33. Evaluate
the in vivo efficacy of such FLIL33 depletion. Achieving these goals will offer new understanding of IL-33
pathobiology and initiate the development of precise, innovative therapeutic modalities."
10883560,"Doxorubicin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase 2a (Top2a), is routinely used in the treatment of breast
cancer, sarcoma, and pediatric leukemia. Of the two topoisomerase 2 isozymes, Top2a is highly expressed in
cancer cells and is required for cell division. However, adult cardiomyocytes express only topoisomerase 2b
(Top2b), which is involved in DNA transcription, but not DNA replication. Long-term cancer survivors who
were treated with doxorubicin and other anthracyclines often suffer from dose-dependent cardiotoxicity.
Laboratory data showed that Top2a mediates doxorubicin’s tumoricidal activity, whereas Top2b
mediates doxorubicin’s cardiotoxic effect. At present, dexrazoxane is the only FDA approved drug for
cardio-protection. The cardio-protective effect of dexrazoxane is due to its ability to bind to the ATPase
domain of Top2b to inhibit Top2b’s catalytic cycle. Currently, dexrazoxane is given concurrently with
doxorubicin. Because dexrazoxane also binds to Top2a, it has the potential to interfere with doxorubicin’s
tumoricidal effect. However, subclinical doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is known to occur much earlier,
perhaps at the initiation of doxorubicin therapy. Thus, dexrazoxane has limited clinical utility as specified by
FDA’s approved indication. In preliminary studies, dexrazoxane induced an ubiquitin/ proteasome-
mediated degradation of Top2b, but not Top2a. By administering dexrazoxane eight hours before
doxorubicin, Top2b will be degraded to avoid cardiotoxicity, whereas Top2a will remain intact to
preserve tumoricidal efficacy. Because the half-life of dexrazoxane is two hours, 93.75% of dexrazoxane
will be eliminated eight hours (four half-lives) after administration. Indeed, dexrazoxane pre-treatment eight
hours before doxorubicin provided complete protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in an animal
model. In this proposal, this novel strategy will be tested in breast cancer patients prescribed doxorubicin-
containing regimens. Two specific aims will be studied. Aim 1: To determine whether dexrazoxane given at a
lower than FDA-approved dose is effective in degrading Top2b and the time-course of Top2b degradation
in human volunteers. Aim 2: To test a mechanism-based hypothesis that early administration of
dexrazoxane prevents doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in non-metastatic, HER2- negative female
breast cancer patients. HER2-negative, stage I-III female breast cancer patients will be enrolled in this
prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients will be monitored by cardiac MRI,
Top2a, Top2b, and biomarkers before and after dexrazoxane/doxorubicin therapy. Tumor regression will be
followed by oncologists clinically. Overall survival, event-free survival, and overall response (using response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors -RECIST) will be collected to compare outcomes of cancer therapy with or
without pre-treatment of dexrazoxane. Successful implementation of these trials will provide a novel and
cost-effective strategy to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity."

Homeostasis is a fundamental feature of physiological control in all cells. In the past ﬁve years, a new
homeostatic principle co-discovered by us has been changing our view of cell-size control. This principle,
known as the “adder”, states that cells add ﬁxed size between birth and division irrespective of the cell size at
birth. The adder principle is therefore distinct from many biological controls due to its passive nature, as the
adder-like cells do not employ any apparent size sensing or feedback mechanisms to trigger division when
they reach a ﬁxed critical size. The proposed program is an extension of our success in cell-size control
research to understand a broader class of physiological controls.
First, we will study the mechanisms responsible for the precision and robustness of physiological processes.
We will focus on replication initiation in bacteria as it can serve as a tractable model to solve these long-
standing problems. Another important aspect of physiological control is how cells allocate their resources to
growth. The current paradigm based on E. coli is that cells balance supply and demand of amino acids to
maximize growth rate under all growth conditions. These models are important because they have been able
to explain the tradeoﬀ between production of cellular energy vs. production of proteins that is pertinent to
cancer. However, we have obtained experimental results in B. subtilis that directly challenged this E. coli centric
view of growth control. We will thus seek more general principles of cellular resource allocation that
encompass both E. coli and B. subtilis, and ideally beyond bacteria. Finally, we will extend our previous work
on cell-size control to investigate how cells ensure physiological equilibrium when proteins and organelles
partition asymmetrically, which is important in the context of inheritance and cellular aging.
These questions require multidisciplinary approaches from physiology to development of novel technologies.
To this end, we will work with collaborators who are leaders in their research ﬁelds. Furthermore, over a
decade we have been making major eﬀorts to democratize technologies to the research community. We expect
the knowledge and technology that will be generated from our proposed research to open exciting new
research avenues and facilitate other important discoveries in physiology and cell biology."
10839802,"As many as 100 million people in the US have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to hepatic injury and fibrosis, characteristics of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and in turn can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma cancer (HCC). To date there are no FDA-approved therapy for NAFLD or NASH. The mTOR pathway is a critical nutrient sensing pathway in many cell types, including hepatocytes. mTORC1 has thus been studied as a target to modulate lipid homeostasis in the liver, but its role remains unclear, with multiple excellent studies lead to seemingly opposing conclusions. We have now uncovered a highly specific branch of mTORC1 signaling in the liver, regulated by the FLCN protein, the inhibition of which leads to coordinated activation of lipid catabolic pathways and strong suppression of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), thereby potently protecting from both NAFLD and ensuing NASH. We thus hypothesize that FLCN represents a uniquely attractive therapeutic target to treat these diseases. We propose experiments to: 1. Understand how, mechanistically, the FLCN arm of mTORC1 signaling suppresses DNL 2. Understand how, mechanistically, the FLCN and canonical arms of mTORC1 signaling feedback on each other 3. Formally test the validity of FLCN as a therapeutic target to treat the NAFLD/NASH/HCC spectrum."
10834997,"Abstract:
Bone marrow (BM) inflammation is a driver of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) aging,
transformation, and marrow failure but also indispensable for innate immune responses to infection. The role of
the microenvironment in the response to inflammation is incompletely understood. We found that unique
subsets of marrow vessels differentially regulate neutrophil or dendritic cell production in respond to
inflammation. We want to understand how the local architecture of the microenvironment controls which –and
how- HSPC respond to infection/inflammation.
We have found that CSF1+ vessels regulate emergency dendritic cell production in response to infection by
targeting myeloid dendritic cell progenitors (MDP) whereas IL1R1+ vessels regulate multipotent progenitors
and committed granulocyte progenitors in response to IL1. We hypothesize “that the local architecture of the
BM vascular microenvironment controls which-and how- HSPC respond to infection/inflammation. Unique
subsets of BM vessels are cellular antennas that sense different inflammatory insults and control commitment
and differentiation of adjacent HSPC in response to these insults. IL1R1+ and CSF1+ vessels are two
examples of these cellular antennas”
We will test this hypothesis in three aims. In Aim 1 we will investigate how the different vessels spatially
organize hematopoiesis and test the hypothesis that proximity to each vessel dictates which progenitor
responds to infection/inflammation. In Aim2 we will investigate the mechanisms through which each type of
vessel regulates HSPSC function and differentiation. In Aim 3 we will determine how each type of vessel
senses and responds to different types of infection/inflammation and test the hypothesis that each vessel has
evolved to sense specific insults."
10840387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The mammalian gastrointestinal tract is home to a complex and diverse collection of microorganisms that
play crucial roles in metabolism, host immunity, and central nervous system function. Despite a growing
appreciation for the importance of a balanced microbiome on human health and behavior, and the wide range of
diseases that can result from dysbiosis, our ability to study and modify complex microbial communities in vivo
remains severely limited. Sequencing efforts can exhaustively catalog bacterial diversity and abundance, but
offer only observational information; gnotobiotic research in mice allows for tight control over colonization, but
fails to represent natural host-microbiome interactions; and genetic engineering can be used to manipulate
specific genes or pathways in select microbes, but not within native environments. To address these
shortcomings, we propose to develop an innovative platform technology for precision microbiome engineering
that will, for the first time, enable gene- and species-specific editing in vivo. Our approach centers around two
recent breakthroughs made in our laboratories: a method for generating precise DNA insertions using CRISPR-
transposon systems (INTEGRATE technology), and a method for mobilizing genetic payloads within the gut
using broad-host-range conjugative vectors (MAGIC technology). By combining and expanding these tools, we
will develop programmable, self-driving elements that disseminate broadly while retaining exquisite nucleotide-
level specificity for target genomes.
 Our preliminary data provide strong evidence to substantiate the basis of our proposal and demonstrate
feasibility. In a recent collaborative effort, we developed INTEGRATE for kilobase-scale bacterial genome
engineering by systematically assessing genome-wide insertion specificity across a panel of guide RNAs, and
demonstrating efficient activity in multiple clinically and industrially relevant bacterial species. In Aim 1, we will
identify hyperactive INTEGRATE variants that function autonomously and proliferatively, and develop a
comprehensive guide RNA design algorithm that incorporates empirical off-target data and large metagenome
assembly information. In Aim 2, we will combinate MAGIC with INTEGRATE to enable mobile transmission and
targeted integration within complex in vitro communities, as well as in a mouse model. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
apply our tool for both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in vivo: 1) to deliver bile salt hydrolase genes
in the murine gut and investigate their corresponding effects on microbiome composition and host metabolism,
and 2) to inactivate multidrug resistance genes in a Klebsiella pneumoniae disease model. Collectively, our
studies will advance powerful new synthetic biology tools that can be broadly and flexibly applied within any
complex bacterial community of interest, for both basic research and eventual therapeutic applications."

Previous research has documented acute harmful effects of cannabis use on verbal episodic memory, but prior
work has not sufficiently considered that the memory effects of cannabis are the compound action of different
cannabinoids acting on different memory processes. Specifically, cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic
component of cannabis (doesn’t produce a “high”), is thought to have cognitively protective properties and may
mitigate some harmful effects of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Preliminary data, including our own, suggest
that THC and CBD render differential effects on memory. Further, few prior studies have tested high potency
strains that are commonly available. Our global hypothesis is that the effects of cannabis on memory vary as a
function of the ratio of CBD to THC, with THC having adverse effects that may be counteracted by CBD. The
goal of this study is to test the effects of three real-world commercially available cannabis strains that differ
markedly in their ratio of CBD to THC. To that end, we will test the effects of -THC/+CBD (0% THC/16% CBD),
+THC/-CBD (16% THC/0% CBD), and +THC/+CBD (16% THC/16% CBD) strains on recognition memory as
well as event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that have previously been found to be related to different
underlying memory processes. We use a naturalistic observational design in which each participant will
complete the same memory task while intoxicated one day and not intoxicated another day (order
counterbalanced). Aim 1 (Experiment 1) will assess recognition memory performance and memory-related
ERP components in cannabis users after self-administration of one of three randomly assigned cannabis
strains (+THC/-CBD vs. -THC/+CBD vs. +THC/+CBD) during both memory encoding (learning) and memory
retrieval. Aims 2 and 3 will dissociate the effects of cannabis on memory encoding vs. retrieval processes. The
effects of the three strains will be tested when users are acutely intoxicated only during memory retrieval (Aim
2, Experiment 2) or when users are intoxicated only during memory encoding (Aim 3, Experiment 3). We
hypothesize a step wise effect of strain in each experiment such that the +THC/-CBD group will demonstrate
the largest decrement in memory accuracy, as compared to the +THC/+CBD group, which will show a larger
memory decrement than the -THC/+CBD group. In addition to strain assignment, CBD and THC blood levels
will also be tested in relation to memory accuracy, with greater CBD/THC levels associated with higher/lower
memory accuracy. We further predict that memory-related ERP components recorded during encoding and
retrieval will show strain and blood level effects paralleling accuracy, with variations in these effects indicating
the relative influences on different memory subprocesses (encoding, familiarity, recollection, post-retrieval
monitoring). This study is critical in today’s climate of rapid legal changes and increased cannabis use for both
recreational and medicinal purposes. Timely and accurate data on the impact of real-world cannabis on
memory processes is critical in order to reduce the harms and identify the benefits of widespread legalization."
10853006,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the prognostic relevance of the cells contributing to it is
vital for developing novel treatments for medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain
tumor. Immune resistance in a murine model of MB (MM1) is associated with enhanced tumor expression of the
immune checkpoint programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in response to anti-tumor cytokine interferon-gamma
(IFNγ) signaling. Disruption of this pathway via knockdown of cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), an essential
transducer of the IFNγ signal, leads to an inflammatory TME phenotype and enhanced tumor rejection in vivo.
IFNγ-induced PD-L1 gene expression is thought to be regulated at the promoter level by competition between
the transcriptional activator IRF1 and repressor IRF2. IFNγ-Cdk5 signaling decreases IRF2 expression and is
associated with hypo-phosphorylation of its co-repressor IRF2BP2, driving IRF1-mediated transcriptional
activation.
IRF2BP2 has emerged as a vital transcriptional co-factor in multiple cell types, with roles in the regulation of
apoptosis, cell cycling, and inflammation. However, its function in cancer is poorly defined. We hypothesize that
formation of the IRF2/IRF2BP2 co-repressor normally attenuates PD-L1 transcription, and that inhibition of this
complex by IFNγ-Cdk5 signaling unleashes PD-L1 expression and results in immune evasion. This project aims
to assess the function of the IRF2/IRF2BP2 complex at the PD-L1 promoter level during basal and IFNγ-
stimulated conditions in MB, with complementary studies on how perturbations in this tumor-intrinsic signaling
pathway leads to shifts in the TME composition in vivo. Aim 1 will characterize the role of IRF2BP2 in mediating
the function of interferon-sensitive response elements (ISRE)-containing gene promoters. Aim 2 will assess the
effect of IRF2BP2 on tumor growth and immune infiltration in vivo. Success in this effort will enable an in-depth
understanding of the tumor-intrinsic regulation of immune sensitivities in MB, thereby facilitating rational targeted
immunotherapeutic approach development in the future against MB and possibly other cancers."
10830380,"Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicit cellular
responses that treat or cure disease. Discovering therapeutic antibodies traditionally requires costly and labor-
intensive, laboratory-based screening experiments. Computational approaches that select antibodies with the
most desirable pharmaceutical properties are thus poised to improve health by accelerating the development of
new drugs. Unfortunately, current algorithms are often unable to distinguish stronger-binding antibodies from
weaker ones. Improvements to structure prediction and molecular visualization will lower costs and increase the
speed with which new drugs are developed by allowing researchers to focus on the most promising candidates
as early in the process as possible.
DNASTAR’s goals are to increase the speed of predicting the structure of antibody-antigen interactions using
superior mathematical methods and to transform antibodies with micromolar binding affinity into those with
improved nanomolar affinity using new computer-aided antibody design techniques. This will accelerate antibody
discovery by enabling detailed and accurate immune complex structure predictions and structure-based
chemical liability detection at a high-throughput scale.
In Phase II, we first created an in silico human germline sequence library and used it to simulate the natural
V(D)J and VJ recombination events of the immune system, generating a new library of assembled antibody
sequences. To select antibody candidates that bound a chosen target, we developed a simulation algorithm in
which antibody candidates were docked against a chosen target protein. The 24 candidates with the best
predicted binding energy were converted to single-chain antibodies and propagated in CHO cells. Three
candidates were found to bind the target using native Western blots. The binding affinity and kinetics of these
three candidates were then measured by bio-layer interferometry. The tightest binding candidate was then
subjected to a form of simulated affinity maturation where individual site-directed mutations were ranked by their
predicted ability to enhance affinity for the antigen. Four out of five tested variants showed improved binding over
its parent using bio-layer interferometry.
The goal of our Phase IIB proposal is to build upon this success and further improve predictive capability by
incorporating unequaled algebraic mathematics and computational acceleration techniques to support the virtual
screening of tens of thousands of antibody sequences. For the first time in history, this will enable antibodies to
be selected for development by first modeling them from germline sequences using a “virtual immune system.”
Our ultimate intent is to deliver a complete antibody discovery pipeline that is powerful, accurate, produces fast
results, and yields lab-scale quantities of DNA and protein materials for the selected antibodies."

Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most prevalent parasitic
disease in the western hemisphere, infecting 8-11 million individuals and with over 70 million at risk. The infection
is transmitted by an insect vector that is native to Latin America, but can also be acquired through blood
transfusion, organ transplant, or congenitally. Following a brief acute phase, the parasite persists for years in
infected carriers, often asymptomatically, but can cause cardiomyopathy and other pathological conditions
leading to severe morbidity and mortality. In the U.S., T. cruzi is prevalent in Latin American immigrant
populations, where it poses an underrecognized health risk. The gradual encroachment of the insect vector into
the southernmost regions of the U.S. has also raised the threat of autochthonous transmission. Chagas disease
is challenging to diagnose due to the combination of genotypic and hence antigenic variation across its
geographical range, complex immunological interactions with the human host, and cross-reactivities with other
parasites. Serology has become the mainstay for diagnosis, especially for chronic infection, but the above
challenges have hampered the accuracy of serologic tests such that multiple assays are commonly used in a
triangulation algorithm to establish final results.
The majority of those at risk for T. cruzi infection live in low-resource, underdeveloped areas where contact with
the vector insects is hard to avoid, but medical care is relatively primitive and laboratory infrastructure is absent.
For these reasons, rapid, point-of-care tests have become increasingly desirable as tools for diagnosis and
epidemiological surveillance of Chagas disease. However, the current generation of Chagas rapid tests is limited
by suboptimal performance, both in sensitivity and specificity, largely due to the reliance on recombinant antigens
which are specific to certain T. cruzi lineages and often fail to detect Mexican and Central American Chagas
cases. To date, only one Chagas rapid test has been cleared by FDA. We propose to complete development of
a rapid test for Chagas disease, based on a native protein antigen from cultured T. cruzi termed TESA
(Trypanosomal Excreted/Secreted Antigens). We have developed procedures to produce with high yield, enrich
and concentrate the antigenic component of TESA, making it suitable for use in a lateral flow assay. In Phase I
studies, the prototype TESA rapid test has shown clinical sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% across a
range of samples from diverse regions spanning the endemic geography of Latin America, including Mexico and
Central America. In Phase II, we will complete development of the TESA lateral flow rapid test in a cost-effective
format suitable for point-of-care use in low-resource settings. The clinical and analytical performance of the test
will be evaluated in a clinical study involving over 1,000 Chagas patients and controls to be carried out at sites
in the U.S. and in an endemic region in Latin America. The clinical study results will support a 510(k) submission
to FDA for clearance of the TESA lateral flow rapid test for in vitro diagnosis of Chagas disease."
10767976,"HIV is one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world. HIV transmission is largely driven by acutely
infected individuals who are unaware of their status or those receiving antiretroviral therapy but not virally
suppressed. Currently available rapid HIV tests, including fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody combo tests,
lack the sensitivity needed for detecting HIV during early stages of acute infection and viral rebound. Nucleic
acid amplification tests (NAATs) that detect HIV-1 RNA, which can be detected in as early as 5 to 10 days after
viral transmission, offer superior sensitivity and are currently the gold standard for detecting HIV during acute
infection and viral rebound. However, NAATs are laborious, time-consuming and rely on expensive
instrumentation and refrigerated components, hindering their use for self-testing.
 Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop and validate a shelf-stable, instrument-free CRISPR-
Cas13-based rapid test for highly sensitive HIV-1 detection in blood or saliva. This high-risk, high-reward
approach is fundamentally different from existing NAATs that involve multiple steps of sample preparation (RNA
extraction and amplification) or require laboratory instrumentation or refrigerated components. Our rapid HIV-1
test will employ an engineered Cas13a enzyme with enhanced collateral activity and stability, and lyophilized
assay components for enhanced shelf life while offering a simplified workflow that can be performed in home
settings (similar to COVID-19 antigen rapid self-tests). A phone app will automatically analyze the readout from
the lateral flow device and present the test results in a clear, simple-to-interpret manner. The rationale for this
research is supported by the applicants' preliminary data demonstrating highly sensitive detection of viral RNA
using a rapid, lateral flow CRISPR-Cas13-based assay and the development of an RRM2-L Cas13a enzyme
with enhanced collateral activity and stability. In the R61 phase, we will pursue the following specific aims:
 1) Characterize HIV-1 RNA levels in saliva and blood from a diverse population of people with HIV;
 2) Investigate strategies for user-friendly device operation;
 3) Develop a shelf-stable, instrument-free CRISPR-Cas13 rapid test for highly sensitive HIV-1 detection.
If the R61 phase milestones are achieved, we will further develop and characterize this platform and validate its
functionality using clinical HIV specimens during the R33 phase by pursuing the following specific aims:
 4) Further develop and characterize the lateral flow CRISPR-Cas13-based rapid HIV-1 test;
 5) Validate the functionality of the CRISPR-Cas13-based rapid HIV-1 test using clinical specimens.
 This approach is innovative because it combines the speed, simplicity and affordability of lateral flow-based
diagnostic tests with the high sensitivity of CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid detection, and it is significant
because it will improve the effectiveness of HIV self-testing for early diagnosis and patient monitoring during ART
therapy, thus minimizing unintentional HIV transmission and reducing HIV-associated morbidity and mortality."

Recreational cannabis use is becoming increasingly common in the United States, even within vulnerable
populations. Amidst growing concerns surrounding the possible adverse consequences of chronic cannabis use,
there is evidence that cannabis use disorder (CUD) is genetically correlated with susceptibility to several
behavioral (e.g., lower educational achievement) and psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia) outcomes, thus bringing
into question prior causal claims. The most aggressively contested discussion surrounds the role of cannabis
use and CUD in the etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and psychotic illness. While there is now an abundance of
evidence supporting shared genetic influences, studies also outline the psychotomimetic effects of especially
high potency forms of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A systematic search for pleiotropic variants that undergird
this comorbidity between CUD and SCZ can not only provide insights into shared biology, but also outline
avenues for identifying subgroups of individuals at greatest risk. This Mentored Research Scientist Development
Award (K01) proposes a research plan that leverages some of the largest currently available genome-wide
association study (GWAS) datasets to (a) conduct a cross-disorder GWAS of CUD with SCZ, and to contrast it
with findings from a similar cross-disorder analysis of cannabis use with SCZ, to identify loci of convergent and
divergent effect; (b) to test for a causal relationship using a genetically-informed approach and harness curated
`omics data from human and rodent models of cannabis exposure and SCZ, to fine-map significant loci and
further prioritize causal variants for biological plausibility; and (c) to utilize polygenic risk scores derived from
these cross-disorder analyses to identify associations with first-episode psychosis, cannabis-induced psychosis,
and childhood psychosis-proneness in independent samples. These research aims are founded on four key
training objectives that will enhance the applicant's career goal of becoming an NIH-funded independent
investigator who works at the interface of addictions and psychiatric illness. These training objectives include (a)
a deep understanding of the clinical effects of acute and chronic exposure to cannabis, (b) integrative
bioinformatics approaches for post-GWAS annotation, including cross-species data (c) an appreciation of the
neurobiology underlying the comorbidity between cannabis and SCZ, and (d) career development towards
leadership and mentorship positions. The applicant builds upon her current funding and training directed at
advanced statistical genetics to addressing comorbidity by adding on novel facets relating more broadly to multi-
omics data integration and more specifically to the unique yet ubiquitous comorbidity between cannabis and
SCZ. Together, this training and research plan will produce some of the first insights into the shared genetic
etiology underlying CUD and SCZ and provide opportunities for functionally targeted future studies, with the
ultimate objective of producing therapeutic alternatives that can partially mitigate the serious personal costs of
chronic cannabis use in SCZ patients."

Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US at a cost of $20 billion annually.
Surgical complications account for a third of these deaths and cost. Surgical performance
directly impacts patient outcomes. Prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is treated
with surgery (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)) that can lead to impotence,
incontinence, and even death. Reliable means of objectively assessing technique are required.
In this project we will focus on assessing surgeon suturing skills during RARP through virtual
reality (VR) simulation. Suturing is a common skill in many types of surgeries, can be tracked
with performance metrics, and has been correlated with patient outcomes after RARP.
In this proposal we seek to first determine the critical sub-step maneuvers of suturing and the
technical skills necessary to achieve them successfully (Aim 1a). Further, we intend to develop
an automated skills assessment pipeline through the analysis of raw kinematic data (Aim 1b),
video (Aim 2b), and both kinematic/video (Aim 2c), from VR simulation performance by
innovative machine learning strategies and deep-learning-based computer vision.
The primary differentiator of the proposed work is determining how well granular sub-step
maneuvers in suturing are performed. Surgeons participating in this study will not only provide
data through their VR simulation performance, but will also contribute real patient data from the
RARP to establish the relationship between surgeon skill, patient factors, and surgical
outcomes. Statistical modeling will measure the differential impact of surgeon skill and patient
factors to patient outcomes (Aim 3). We hypothesize that innovative application of machine
learning algorithms can accurately assess surgeon technical skills, and can further anticipate
likelihood of relevant clinical outcomes.
The proposed work will enable scalable and actionable feedback in VR, empowering surgeons
with valuable knowledge to minimize surgical risk in live surgery."

Metastatic melanoma is challenging to clinically address. Although standard of care combination BRAF and MEK
inhibitor (BRAFi/MEKi) therapy has high response rates in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, therapy
relapse occurs in most cases. Work from our laboratory and others in the field has identified subpopulations of
intrinsically BRAFi/MEKi-resistant melanoma cells that are highly metastatic and drivers of therapy relapse.
These “persistent” melanoma cells display molecular and biologic properties akin to neural crest stem cells
(NCSC), including high invasiveness, plasticity and self-renewal capacity. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the
dominant molecular mechanisms that mediate the plasticity and aggressiveness of NCSC-like melanoma cells.
Our preliminary studies identify a developmental LPAR1-YAP1 axis as critical for melanoma aggressiveness.
One of the main objectives of this project will assess whether LPAR1-YAP1 activity represents an actionable
vulnerability to ablate the metastatic potential and intrinsic resistance of NCSC-like cells. The proposed aims will
leverage a multidisciplinary systems-biology approach spanning inducible genetic-editing techniques, lineage
analysis of NCSC-like melanoma cells through time, metastatic patient-derived xenograft (Met-PDX) melanoma
models, scRNAseq, RNA FISH and advanced bioinformatics, with the goal of translating the gained knowledge
into novel therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced cancer.
Another main goal is to establish an independent research program conducting multidisciplinary and
collaborative research. To ensure the completion of the proposed work, my committee and I have identified four
core competencies I will strengthen with continuous training, as well as didactic courses on single cell analysis
and bioinformatic approaches. I will also participate in career training through workshops covering grant writing,
manuscript preparation and presentation, responsible conduct of research, conflicts of interest, lab/budget
management and guidance from my mentors. With the protected time and stability provided by the K01 award,
as well as the comprehensive training I will receive, I am confident that I will be able to establish an independent
research program and successfully acquire R01 funding.
My short-term career goals are to:
1. Secure an independent faculty position and expand my scientific network of colleagues.
2. Define clonal diversity and molecular vulnerabilities of NCSC-like melanoma cells.
3. Continue to develop my scientific capabilities through my mentor/advisory committee and attain R01 funding.
My long-term career goals are to:
1. Develop ongoing projects, expand into new directions and preclinical studies based on new results obtained.
2. Successfully renew R01 funding and attain alternate sources of funding, continue career development.
3. Translate discoveries clinically, train future mentees, and maintain a productive research program."

For children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), epilepsy surgery is the best treatment to stop seizures and
prevent a life of disability. Crucial to the success of surgery is the ability to identify the area of the brain that is
responsible for generating seizures, called epileptogenic zone (EZ). The best way to estimate the EZ is by
recording the brain activity invasively via intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG), aiming to capture
seizures and locate the area that generates them. Yet, one of three patients continue to have seizures after
surgery. This suggests that there is still an unmet need for new methods that go beyond traditional icEEG
interpretation and offer novel information on underlying epileptogenicity in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery
evaluation. To address this need, we propose a novel approach to analyze icEEG that takes advantage of new
“invisible” signal characteristics, which can inform us on epileptogenicity, albeit not visible to the human reader.
Epileptogenicity is a very complex brain property that depends on the interplay between altered excitability and
connectivity. Recent evidence suggests that, to treat focal DRE, we must localize pathological regions (depicted
by altered excitability) and also appreciate how they interact within the epileptogenic network (identifying altered
connections). In this application, we propose to develop a novel twofold approach to optimize the interpretation
of icEEG, which quantifies and integrates both local brain excitability (via phase-amplitude coupling, PAC) and
functional connectivity (FC), using “silent” icEEG epochs (i.e. without frank epileptiform patterns), in order to
define novel measures of “interconnected-excitability” (which we will call Network-PAC). Our main goal is to
develop a new computer-aided approach to boost icEEG reading and improve surgical planning in children with
DRE, without requiring the recording of seizures or even the identification of frank interictal epileptiform activity.
We hypothesize that the EZ is characterized not only by a high ‘local excitability level’ (strong PAC) but also by
strong connections with other ‘excitable’ tissue, thus generating a hyper-excitable network that is responsible for
generating seizures. We will pursue two specific aims: (1) Identify regions of high inter-connected excitability and
assess their ability to define the seizure onset zone (SOZ); (2) Develop a predictive model that integrates patient-
specific icEEG information about both local PAC and functional networks (independently from the presence of
frank epileptiform patterns) to predict surgical outcome following a resection. This application will combine the
use of cutting-edge electrophysiological and signal processing concepts (cross-frequency coupling, connectivity,
and graph theory) together with extensive neuroimaging and clinical experience with children. Our research will
present to the epilepsy community a new approach to estimate the EZ before epilepsy surgery, which will go
beyond the visual identification of seizures or spikes on the EEG. This can significantly impact the clinical care
of children with DRE in the long-term, by boosting the pre-surgical interpretation of icEEG and reducing the need
for extended invasive monitoring - which is often needed to capture spontaneous seizures."

Oncogenic RAS mutations, which are among the most common molecular alterations in cancer, encode
mutant proteins that dominantly drive aberrant growth. Unfortunately, structural and biochemical properties of
the mutant Ras/GTPase activating protein (Ras/GAP) molecular switch pose formidable barriers to
mechanism-based drug discovery and no targeted therapies have been approved for Ras-driven cancers to
date. The Ras palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle regulates the subcellular trafficking of the N-Ras, H-Ras,
and K-Ras4a isoforms, but not of K-Ras4b. Thus, developing potent and selective inhibitors of the Ras
palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle has the potential to treat malignancies dependent on oncogenic N-Ras
without interfering with K-Ras4b signaling in normal tissues. This ongoing project involves a cross-disciplinary
collaboration between investigators with complementery expertise in biochemistry, chemical biology,
hematologic cancer, Ras signaling, and preclinical therapeutics. During the current funding period we: (1)
validated N-Ras palmitoylation as a promising therapeutic target for NRAS mutant cancers in a novel strain of
NrasG12D,C181S “knock in” mice; (2) identified the ABHD17 family of serine hydrolase (SH) enzymes as N-Ras
depalmitoylases; (3) showed that the Palmostatin class of SH inhibitors are too promiscuous for use as
selective probes of ABHD17 function; (4) identified, in collaboration with Lundbeck, a structurally distinct class
of selective ABHD17 inhibitors that reduce the growth of NRAS mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells
and exhibit genotype-specific activity in isogenic models; and, (5) demonstrated that reduced growth of NRAS
mutant AML cells treated with ABHD17 inhibigtors correlates with biochemical inhibition of Ras effector
pathways. The experiments proposed in this renewal application will extend these exciting studies through the
following specific aims: Aim 1. To investigate the roles of ABHD17s and additional SH enzymes in N-Ras
depalmitoylation and to test the potent and bioavailable ABHD17 inhibitor ABD778 in preclinical models of
AML; and, Aim 2. To identify palmitoyl acyl transferase (PAT) proteins that modify N-Ras and to validate them
as targets for N-Ras mutant cancers. We anticipate that the studies described in this interdisciplinary project
will determine fundamental mechanisms of N-Ras palmitoylation, ascertain the efficacy and mechanism of
action of chemical inhibitors of ABHD17s alone and in combination with other targeted agents, and generate
essential foundational knowledge for developing PAT inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. The development of
selective inhibitors of oncogenic N-Ras signaling would have significant therapeutic impact for a number of
different aggressive adult and pediatric cancers."
10815563,"African American (AA) women presents with aggressive metastatic subtype of triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) compared to other ethnicities and experience greater mortality rates. Although health care disparities
contribute to poor prognosis in AA women but a race-specific genetic component to TNBC disparity cannot be
ruled out. Thus, racially-segregated genetic determinant underlying TNBC disparity remains an unmet clinical
need. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting that an oncogenic tripartite motif-containing
protein 37 (TRIM37) protein predisposes AA women to highly aggressive TNBC. We demonstrate that 1)
TRIM37 associates with metastatic phenotype and overall survival in TNBC patients, 2) TRIM37 is expressed
at higher level in the breast and TNBC tumor tissue of AA women relative to other races, 3) TRIM37-
associated single nucleotide polymorphism correlates with high TRIM37 expression in AA women, 4) TRIM37
regulates genes and pathways involved in metastasis cascade, such as promoting survival in circulation, 5) AA
TNBC cells showed increased dependency on oncogenic TRIM37 compared to non-AA TNBC cell lines in vitro
and in vivo, 6) TRIM37 depletion reduces distant infiltration and growth in metastasis murine model 7) TRIM37
inhibition using targeted nanoparticles-based delivery of TRIM37-specific antisense oligonucleotides reduces
TNBC tumor growth. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that higher TRIM37 levels in AA women gives a
would-be cancer cell a “head start” by creating a pre-metastatic niche. This hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims. In aim 1, we will evaluate TRIM37-allelic variants, that we have already identified, through small-
scale phenotypic screen based on anoikis resistance. We will also determine the mechanism of TRIM37-allelic
variants by comparing the biological activity of TRIM37 risk and reference alleles. In aim 2, we will compare
and contrast the relative contribution of TRIM37 to TNBC metastatic potential in race-dependent manner. We
will also track association between TRIM37 and its transcriptional signatures with race, metastasis incidence,
and patient's survival using disease-free and tumor tissue from TNBC patients. In aim 3, we will compare the
metastatic potential of TRIM37-depleted and TRIM37 overexpressing race-specific breast and TNBC cells
using spontaneous metastasis murine models. Finally, we will test newly engineered TNBC selective
therapeutic platform to inhibit TRIM37 using spontaneous metastasis, race-specific patient-derived xenografts
and humanized murine models. Together, the proposed studies will demonstrate that TRIM37 is a genetic
variant associated with high TNBC risk in AA women and proof-of-concept results will establish the clinical
relevance of inhibiting TRIM37 for TNBC treatment."

The use of light to activate therapeutic agents at diseased sites offers the advantage of
aggressive treatment with exquisite spatial and temporal control, thereby reducing
potential deleterious side effects at unintended sites. Although photo-activated pro-drugs
have been reported, these species require short wavelengths (<450 nm) for activation.
However, maximal tissue penetrance by light occurs within the “optical window of tissue”
(600 – 900 nm), well beyond the wavelength range of existing photo-cleavable functional
groups. We’ve developed a new technology that transforms drugs into light responsive
“phototherapeutics” that are conveyed by circulating erythrocytes. The proposed
research program seeks to address several fundamental questions associated with light
responsive therapeutics: (1) What is the mechanism of light capture and drug release in
the B12-based molecular scaffolds, (2) what is the optimized structural relationship
between the light capturing antennas and the photolysis of the B12-drug bond, (3) what
is the scope of therapeutic agents that are amenable to this photo-technology, (4) do
phototherapeutics furnish an enhanced therapeutic window relative to the standard of
care, and (5) what is the relationship between the activation wavelength and the
therapeutic window?"
